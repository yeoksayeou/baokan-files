### Someone's Aggression Towards Jin and Sui Provinces: Recruiting a Large Number of Traitors

Spreading Rumors to Undermine Unification, Authorities Have Already Taken Strict Precautions; Yan's Medical Examination Results are Good

[Taiyuan] According to reports from the Sacrifice to Save the Nation Alliance, a certain party is actively invading Jin and Sui provinces. Several months ago, they recruited 5,000 traitors in Taiyuan to go to Tianjin for training, where they were taught activity strategies.

The original date for his departure to Japan was set for the 29th on the Hoover liner, but he received a telegram from Vice Minister Chen (Jie) stating that Ambassador Kawagoe would arrive in Shanghai on the Asama Maru on the 29th, and they would meet in Shanghai.

Although the Japanese government has some misunderstandings about our country, we will always move them with "Justice" and touch them with "Sincerity." China is currently on the path to rejuvenation and urgently seeks to achieve satisfactory diplomatic results, which is difficult to do at the moment. We can only gradually improve relations between the two countries after resolving the difficulties and obstacles between China and Japan in a passive manner. I have always said that the key to a country's standing in the world lies within, not without. That is, the more united a country is internally, the higher its international standing will be. The change in international perception of our country after the Xi'an Incident is a practical example. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Chairman Wang's condition has improved after Doctors Qi Shounan and Song Wusheng, as well as his attending physician Luo Guanglin, jointly diagnosed and treated him for a recurrence of heart disease in the past two days. The doctors' opinion is that he should rest quietly in bed and should not handle affairs or receive guests within a week. It is best to take a leave of absence for two months to recuperate quietly in order to receive fundamental treatment. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)

(Local News) Central Committee Member Chu Minyi came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. When reporters visited him and inquired about his mission in Shanghai and Chairman Wang's condition, he said that he came to Shanghai to handle the affairs of the Sino-French Institute of Technology and preside over the graduation examinations. Chairman Wang came to Shanghai this Tuesday to give a speech to the students in training and to examine his health. He returned to Nanjing by night train on Wednesday and arrived in Nanjing at his residence the next morning. After resting briefly, he attended the Central Standing Committee meeting. After the meeting, he returned to his residence to read and reply to letters and telegrams. He had lunch at 12:00 PM, but before he could finish half of his meal, he felt unwell, his heart was beating very fast, and there were occasional pauses. He felt unable to support himself and moved to sit on the sofa to rest, but he still could not hold on, so he lay down immediately. Those who were dining with him saw that his complexion was poor and his limbs were cold, and they quickly called Dr. Qi from the Central Hospital for treatment. After taking the medicine, he felt a little more comfortable. Madam Wang happened to be in Shanghai at the time and was urgently called to Nanjing from Shanghai, accompanied by Song Wusheng. By the time they returned to Nanjing, it was already 8:00 PM. They immediately conducted another examination and jointly discussed treatment methods with Dr. Qi and how to avoid a recurrence of heart disease in the future. Wang had been found to have intermittent heart disease when he had a liver illness in the summer of two years ago. At that time, he went to Qingdao for treatment. Later, he was injured and underwent two surgeries in Nanjing and Shanghai to remove bullets from his back, experiencing great pain. The new injury caused the old illness to recur. He had an episode of intermittent heart disease while on a boat trip to Europe. The doctor advised him to go to Czechoslovakia for treatment. Since returning to China this spring, he had a recurrence in March, but it was very mild. This time, it was more severe than the previous episodes. The reason is that he has been giving speeches and instructions back and forth between Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai in recent days, and he has been overworking. In addition, the weather has been uncertain, which has triggered the old illness. His back sometimes feels painful. The blood sugar test he had in Shanghai a few days ago still showed more than one hundred and sixty parts per thousand of sugar. He should recover after resting for a few days. However, Wang has diseases of the gallbladder, liver, pancreas, and heart, so he must pay very close attention to his diet and daily life. He is quite disciplined with his diet at home, but it is not easy to control when he goes out for entertainment, so he must avoid banquets and avoid overwork. In particular, he should avoid hot places in the summer to recover his health more easily. (Central News Agency)

Additionally, the draft of the Goods Exit Tax Law, which was on the 18th's agenda, was withdrawn by the Finance Committee to the Yuan meeting and therefore not discussed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)

[Nanjing] The Law on Punishing Desertion by Police, passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 18th, is as follows: Article 1: Police officers, chiefs, and constables who leave their posts without cause shall be punished according to the following: ㊀ Those absent for more than six days shall be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for up to six months. ㊁ Those absent for more than three days in martial law areas shall be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for up to one year.

[Nanjing] The Finance, Economics, Legal System, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting in the Yuan meeting hall on the afternoon of the 18th to review the National General Budget for the 26th year. Ma Yinchu chaired the meeting. Yang Rumei and Ouyang Baozhen, representatives from the Directorate-General of Budget, and Li Tang and Pang Songzhou, representatives from the Ministry of Finance, attended to present their views. As a result, the committees decided that the content of the proposal was complex, and resolved that each of the five committees would nominate two members, together with the chairmen of the five committees, to form a subcommittee to conduct a preliminary review before reporting back to the joint meeting for discussion. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)

[Nanjing] The draft of the Provisional Inheritance Tax Law was drafted by the Ministry of Finance based on the ten principles issued by the central government. After the proposal was delivered to the Legislative Yuan, Yuan President Sun assigned it to the Finance Committee, which in turn assigned it to committee members Chen Changheng, Zheng Hongnian, Liu Zhendong, Shi Weihuan, and Liu Tongwu for preliminary review. After discussion, Chen and others believed that inheritance tax and estate tax should be collected simultaneously. However, the central government's principles only mentioned collecting the total estate tax, without any provision for collecting inheritance tax. It was necessary to first change the principles before discussing the law. Therefore, they drafted a revised draft of the inheritance tax principles and submitted it to the Finance Committee for approval. The Finance Committee did not comment on Chen's proposal, but only resolved that the inheritance tax could be implemented later. If it must be implemented immediately, the Yuan meeting should decide whether to amend the inheritance tax principles. The Finance Committee itself was divided on the matter. Ma Yinchu, Shi Weihuan, and others advocated for delaying the inheritance tax, forming the faction for delay. Chen Changheng, Liu Zhendong, and others advocated for collecting inheritance tax and estate tax simultaneously, forming the faction for amendment. As a result, a fierce dispute erupted between the two factions during the Yuan meeting's review of the proposal on the 18th. The sharp exchange between Ma Yinchu and Chen Changheng was particularly remarkable. In addition, Yang Gongda, Lü Zhiyi, and other members who were not on the Finance Committee also spoke, either opposing Ma Yinchu's change of heart from his usual advocacy for the rapid implementation of direct taxes to suddenly advocating for delaying the inheritance tax, or opposing Chen Changheng's proposal to impose inheritance tax in addition to the central government's provision for collecting total estate tax. Liang Hancao and Lin Bin advocated for re-reviewing the proposal. After the chairman declared the debate closed, the proposal was reassigned to the Finance, Economics, and Legal System Committees for review, convened by Ma Yinchu. The chairman also instructed Ma to convene a joint meeting of the three committees immediately to elect members to a subcommittee for review, in order to ensure that the legislation of the proposal was thorough. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)

### Motives Behind the Enactment of the Commercial Registration Law

[Nanjing] The Commercial Registration Law has been under review by the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan for three years. The motivation behind the enactment of this law stems from a request by merchants. Chambers of Commerce in various regions believe that Article 681 of the Civil Code, regarding joint and several liability of partnerships, hinders commercial development. They advocated for amending the article to change the partnership liability to several liability. The proposal was submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the Legislative Yuan for review. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan resolved that Article 681 of the Civil Code did not need to be amended, and instead the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees were to draft the Commercial Registration Law, and study the merchants' proposal for several liability in partnerships when drafting the law. The two committees have now meticulously drafted the law, and have made compromise provisions regarding the issue of partnership liability. If partners apply for registration according to law, they will still bear the joint and several liability of partnerships as stipulated in Article 681 of the Civil Code. If partners only register according to law, and their agreed capital contribution is not registered as a partner of the partnership, they will be regarded as a silent partner, and the provisions of the Civil Code regarding silent partners will apply. This compromise provision was unanimously approved by the Yuan meeting on the 18th. Huang Youchang proposed at the Yuan meeting to change the partnership liability to joint several liability, but it was not accepted by the Yuan meeting. Joint and several liability of partnerships means that, for example, in a partnership of three people, any one person is liable for the responsibilities of all three people. Several liability of partnerships means that, for example, in a partnership of three people, any one person is only liable for their own share of the responsibility. A silent partner refers to someone who invests capital but remains anonymous, and if the partnership business fails, they are only liable up to the amount of their investment. This approach can prevent unscrupulous individuals from using the names of well-known people in society to form partnerships to raise their business credit, attract customers, and defraud them of payments for goods, thereby protecting the interests of the general public. Furthermore, Article 29 of the Commercial Registration Law, passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 18th, stipulates that commercial registration shall be handled by the parties concerned with the competent authorities in the location of the business.

### Northeastern Farmers Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese Army Endure Extreme Oppression

Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young, They Flee into Russian Territory

[Moscow] Recently, Chinese and Korean farmers of good standing residing in the puppet state have been fleeing into Soviet territory in increasing numbers due to their inability to endure the cruel oppression of the Japanese puppet authorities. On June 3, Soviet border guards on the Russian bank of the Songhua River discovered seven farmers carrying all their possessions and livestock across the border into Russia. They were detained. After questioning, they claimed that they could not bear the oppression of the Japanese puppet authorities, so they entered Soviet territory to seek refuge. The next day, seven men and three women, carrying seven children, crossed into Soviet territory in the same area. On the 5th, another thirteen people moved in. They all said in unison that the reason for their escape was that the Japanese side was imposing unbearable oppression on the natives of the puppet state, especially those living in the border regions.

### Can Germany Reach a Compromise with England and France?

— Hua

In the past month, German diplomacy has shown unprecedented activity. After Defense Minister von Blomberg went to England to participate in the coronation ceremony, he flew to Rome to meet with Mussolini. Foreign Minister Neurath went to the Balkans not long ago and will visit London next week. In addition, Economic Minister Schacht went to France last month to discuss economic cooperation. Now, Chief of the General Staff Beck has also arrived in Paris to meet with French Chief of the General Staff Gamelin. According to political observers, the dispatch of so many military, diplomatic, and financial figures indicates that Germany is seeking to approach England and France. Therefore, the overall situation in Europe may soon undergo significant developments.

But what aspect do these so-called new developments refer to? Diplomatic overtures are only a superficial gesture. To reach a compromise through this gesture, concessions must be made and understandings reached on certain practical issues. In the current tense situation in Europe, on what issues can Germany make concessions to England and France?

There are several important issues in Europe at present. The Western European Pact is one, the Spanish issue is another, and the Central European issue, stirred up by the Rome-Berlin Axis, is also one. In addition, Germany and Italy's opposition to the collective security alliance of France, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia can also be considered an issue. In the past few months, the two fascist giants, Germany and Italy, have formed an alliance to jointly obstruct the conclusion of the Western European Pact, openly aid the Spanish rebels, and even actively strengthen the Rome-Berlin Axis, attempting to enlist the various small and weak countries of Central Europe to cut off the broad alliance of England, France, and the Soviet Union. All of this indicates that Germany and Italy have absolutely no tendency to compromise with England and France, but rather to restore the Central European alliance of the Great War of 1914 and create a head-on confrontation with England, France, and Russia.

So why has Germany turned around now and shown a gesture of approaching and compromising with England and France? Does it feel remorse for the great disaster caused by the clumsy diplomacy of Wilhelm II before the Great War of 1914? On the surface, it seems so. But in reality, it may not be reliable. We see that it is the leader of the national defense forces and Neurath, the representative of traditional German diplomacy, who are carrying out the outreach to England and France, and not figures such as Göring or Ribbentrop, who are disliked by England and France. It seems that Germany's diplomatic approach is indeed different from before. However, beyond this superficial approach, it is difficult for us to believe that Germany and Italy can truly make concessions to England and France on the current major issues in Europe.

At present, German and Italian troops are still on the Iberian Peninsula, helping the rebels attack Bilbao. They will never abandon the Rome-Berlin political axis, but will only make this political axis a military axis. They will not change their original opposition to the collective security organization formed by the Franco-Soviet and Czech-Soviet mutual assistance agreements. The only possibility is that Germany will show some degree of concession on the wording of the Western European Pact or the issue of returning former German colonies. And the price they demand will be, through the relationship with England, to force France and Czechoslovakia to abandon their mutual assistance relations with the Soviet Union. But if this collective peace alliance is broken, will Germany and Italy maintain a long-term attitude of compromise with England and France? This is another big question. Because of this, even if the British government is fooled, the French government will not allow it. Even if Chamberlain and his stubborn Conservative Party colleagues are tempted, enlightened people in England will not allow it. Therefore, yesterday's "News Chronicle" in England issued a warning: "If England abandons France and abandons European collectivism for the sake of temporary self-interest, it will betray the democratic front, and world peace will suffer a major blow." This warning makes us understand that Germany's approach to England and France at present is only a gesture, and there is little possibility of reaching a true compromise. Although the "Roman Tribune" says it well, "Europe today can breathe more freely than before." But where does the free air come from?

### Trotsky Criticizes Stalin's Policies

Says They Will Lead the Country to Collapse; Advocates Establishing a Soviet Democratic System

⊙Mexico City The Soviet opposition leader Trotsky recently sent a telegram to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, stating, "The policies pursued by Stalin will lead the Soviet Union to complete collapse both domestically and abroad. The only way to save the situation at this moment is to thoroughly change the policies pursued by Stalin, establish a Soviet democratic system, and publicly re-examine the recent Moscow cases. If so, I will do my best to assist you." (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th, Havas)

### Soviet Party Prison

More Than 1,000 People Arrested in Belarus

[Moscow] Today's Minsk newspapers have been delivered here, reporting that a total of 1,170 people have been arrested in Belarus this time. (National Telegram, 18th)

[Moscow] It is claimed here that Zhilibas, the director of the Soviet Far East Political Police, has been dismissed and arrested. All of Yagoda's "five pillars of support in the political police" have been purged. According to Tai's biography, he was originally named Sabadni when he served as the director of the Ukrainian Political Police eight years ago. He later changed his name to the current name when he was transferred to the Far East. There was great shock here after the news of Tai's arrest was confirmed. (National Haitong Telegram, 18th)

### Process of Uncovering the Red Army General's Treason Case

Attributed to a Female Spy

⊙Warsaw According to reports here, the reason why the Tukachevsky case was uncovered was due to a woman named Voronsov. The woman, dressed in glamorous attire, had been in contact with Tukachevsky for a long time. With an intimate attitude, she finally discovered the conspiracy. As a result, after Tukachevsky was executed, the Soviet government immediately promoted the woman to deputy head of the anti-espionage agency. (National Haitong Telegram, 17th)

### Yurenev Appointed Russian Ambassador to Germany

[Moscow] The rumor that former Ambassador to Japan Yurenev had been arrested has been firmly denied by the authorities, stating that Yurenev has now been transferred to be the Soviet Ambassador to Germany. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th, Reuters)

### Hirota Reports on Soviet Political Situation at Cabinet Meeting

[Tokyo] At the cabinet meeting on the 18th, Foreign Minister Hirota explained the situation of the Soviet internal strife as follows: "The truth about the recent events in the Soviet Union has not yet been fully ascertained, so it is not appropriate to make assertions. However, according to my observation, today's Soviet Union places its main emphasis on foreign expansion, and the officials who have been stationed abroad for a long time have unknowingly become fond of women, so those with stronger colors are gradually concentrated in the country. This is the same as during the French Revolution, when the nobles tried to start an uprising again after the revolution, wanting to restore Napoleon's regime, but the ending was still a failure. Stalin is extremely vigilant, fearing that a Napoleon will be found in the Soviet Union, so he executed Marshal Tukhachevsky, who was most likely to become a Napoleon, and performed a blood sacrifice. As for the interior of the Soviet Union, young people around the age of twenty are gradually filling their power, and the inherent position of the old revolutionaries is gradually being suppressed, all making sounds of dissatisfaction. This is the so-called conspiracy of the Trotskyites. The rumors are roughly like this. It is that the insurgents have won, so I think it is necessary to consider the situation of the Soviet Union's recent events." (Allied Telegram, 18th)

### Japanese Measure Terrain on Russian-Korean Border

Facilitates Military Transportation

[Moscow] It is announced here that a new seaport will be built in Provideniya Bay on the northern coast of the Far East. Several batches of workers have already arrived in Vladivostok and will be transferred to the area. The Soviet people attach great importance to the port construction plan, because the port is an important port between the Soviet mainland and the Bering Strait. It is said that, in terms of transporting troops and munitions, the northern waterway is even more important than the Siberian Railway. (National Haitong Telegram, 18th)

### Pacific Pact Difficult to Realize in the Short Term

Both England and Japan Hold a Cautious Attitude; Informal Negotiations are Underway

[London] According to today's news, the proposal of Australian Prime Minister Lyons to conclude a Pacific Pact is unlikely to be realized in the short term, no matter what. Although this proposal has received general sympathy, there are practical difficulties, such as the request of "Manchukuo" to participate in the treaty conference, and the attitude of the Soviet Union is not easy to eliminate. If we want such a meeting to have a chance of success, the initial contact will be delayed for a long time due to these difficulties. This is recognized by all those who are sincere. When the British Imperial Conference was in progress, Lyons discussed this matter with Guo Taiqi, the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Yoshida Shigeru, the Japanese envoy. The opinions of the Chinese in London on this matter seem to be inconsistent. It is believed that Japan and the British Dominions all hold a cautious attitude towards this proposal. It is heard that the informal procedures for the British-Japanese talks are progressing smoothly, but the date of the talks has not yet been determined. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th, Reuters)

### Limit on Main Battleship Gun Caliber

Japan Decides to Refuse Consideration; Formally Notifies the US Ambassador

[Tokyo] Regarding the US proposal to hold negotiations between the countries concerned to discuss limiting the caliber of main battleship guns to 14 inches, Japan has refused. Today, Foreign Minister Hirota notified the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, of this decision. The Japanese government's decision is the result of consultations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy. Observers have long known that Japan will never change its naval views, because the Japanese government believes that only qualitative restrictions, and no quantitative restrictions, can not achieve true naval disarmament. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th, Reuters)

[Washington] The US government has inquired with the major naval powers whether they would agree to limit the caliber of battleship guns to 14 inches. Except for Japan, all have replied that they are willing to agree, but it must be followed by all countries. The US Navy Department plans to build two new battleships, which must now wait for Japan's statement of will before starting construction. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th, Havas)

[Washington] It was learned today that the United States has begun negotiations with major countries to limit the caliber of main battleship guns to 14 inches. When Naval Secretary Swanson opened bids for the construction of 35,000-ton battleships today, he said that the United States was unwilling to compete with others to build 16-inch caliber guns.

### Soviet Union and Latvia Maintain Long-Standing Friendship

Based on the Principles of Collective Security; Promote Close Cooperation Between the Two Countries

[Moscow] The Soviet government issued a statement, which reads: "After Latvian Foreign Minister Munters came to Moscow, he held several talks with Chairman Molotov of the Council of People's Commissars and Foreign Commissar Litvinov. Regarding Soviet-Latvian relations, the general international situation, especially the security of Eastern Europe, after a friendly and open exchange of views, both sides agreed that the Soviet-Latvian relations, which have always been sincere and harmonious, will never be damaged, and there will be no differences of opinion. At the same time, it also confirmed that all the prerequisites for the effective development and strengthening of this friendship by both governments exist, especially on the major issues of international relations. The views of the Soviet Union and Latvia are completely the same, because both sides recognize that in the current international situation, it is necessary to unite all forces, and to consolidate world peace based on the principles of collective security and the League of Nations, and at the same time, to prepare to use all opportunities to cooperate favorably to achieve this goal. This is particularly beneficial to the relations between the two countries." (TASS dispatch, 17th)

### Passage of the Financial Bill in the French Chamber of Deputies

Authorizing the Government to Revise Tax Rates

[Paris] After a brief debate today, the French Chamber of Deputies passed the financial bill authorizing the government by a vote of 374 to 251. This bill authorizes the government to increase or decrease tariffs as it sees fit. Well-informed sources anticipate that the government will raise tariff rates, while also fearing that prices will rise as a result, and that technical difficulties will increase in trade. (National Maritime Telegraph from Paris, 18th)

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies has recently passed a bill authorizing the government to amend customs import rates by legal order and to take necessary measures to prevent the dumping of foreign goods, but negotiable instruments of gold and paper money and various securities are not included in this. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 18th)

[Paris] The Finance Committee of the Senate met this afternoon to examine the bill of full financial power, which will take about one or two days to complete. Therefore, the Senate will be able to discuss this case at the earliest on the 19th. At the meeting of the Finance Committee today, Finance Minister Olivol attended to explain the details, but the content was not announced. As generally known, several members of the Finance Committee inquired about how the government intends to exercise its full powers over the supervision of banking and exchange businesses and the prevention of speculation. Olivol answered them. After the meeting, a press release was issued, stating that the Finance Committee has decided to ask Olivol to draft a clear provision on how to prevent tax evasion and speculation. Olivol issued a statement saying that if various measures to prevent speculation were publicly discussed, speculators would find ways to evade them once they heard the news, and various measures would be ineffective. The Finance Committee is now scheduled to continue its meeting at 3 p.m. tomorrow, and Prime Minister Blum will personally attend to give an explanation (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 17th).

### Former French President Doumergue Passed Away Yesterday

[Paris] Former President Doumergue, a great statesman, passed away today in his hometown of Aigues-Vives, at the age of seventy-four. After graduating from the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris in his early years, he practiced law in Nîmes. From 1890 to 1893, he served as a judge in Vietnam and French Algeria in Africa. In the same year, he was elected as a member of parliament in the Gard province of his home country. From 1902 to 1905, he served as the Minister of Colonies. From 1905 to 1906, he served as the Vice President of the House of Representatives. He then successively served as the Minister of Commerce, Labor, and Education. In 1910, he was elected as a senator in the Gard province. In 1913, he came out to form a cabinet and served as a minister. He resigned in 1914. From 1914 to 1917, he served as the Minister of Colonies. In 1923, he was elected as the President of the Senate. In 1924, he was elected as the President of the Republic, serving until his term expired in 1931. In February 1934, after the conflict between the left and right wings in Paris due to the Stavisky scandal, the Daladier cabinet was forced to resign. The country was in turmoil. Doumergue responded to the requests of all parties and formed a cabinet of national unity, which was greatly expected. However, in November of the same year, he proposed a constitutional reform plan, which was opposed by the Radical Socialist Party, and he retired cleanly and enjoyed the tranquility of the mountains and forests, no longer interfering in political affairs, which has been more than two years now.

### Steel Industry Labor Strike in the United States

Government Mediates, Hoping for an Early Resolution

[Washington] Regarding the strike in the U.S. steel industry, it is hoped that it will be resolved soon because the government has organized a federal committee to mediate all aspects of the dispute. The committee members include Charles Taft, son of former President Taft, Galisen, director of the Labor Mediation Bureau, and MacGrady, Undersecretary of Labor. The strike in the U.S. steel industry broke out in Chicago on May 26, affecting as many as 100,000 workers. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 17th)

### Japanese Ministry of Finance Strictly Restricts Foreign Exchange

Preventing Capital Outflow, Taking Emergency Measures

[Tokyo] Japan is now implementing the most stringent restrictions on capital outflows because the expansion of productivity requires a great deal of capital. Since the Exchange Control Law was amended in January of this year, capital exports have not been able to be carried out without the permission of the Ministry of Finance. In March and April of this year, Kurashiki Rayon Co., Ltd., Dai Nippon Spinning Co., Ltd., Kishiwada Spinning Co., Ltd., and Kureha Spinning Co., Ltd. purchased Chinese spinning mills in Tianjin and applied to the Ministry of Finance for the funds needed for export. The Ministry of Finance reserved the right to approve the application, fearing the escape of funds and further aggravating the inverse trend of the Japanese yen exchange rate. After repeated applications from the aforementioned companies, the Ministry of Finance agreed to the three points proposed by the companies, only allowing the export of the minimum amount of funds needed, and only to the extent absolutely necessary. Until recently, it was heard that the Ministry of Finance, in view of the increased need for domestic funds and the deterioration of Japan's international accounts, implemented stricter restrictions on capital exports. Even regarding the funds necessary for expanding Japanese industry in North China, the Ministry has decided to adopt a policy of not easily granting permission. It is said that there are two reasons for adopting this attitude: (1) The current situation in North China proves that economic cooperation with Japan cannot be actively carried out, so it is considered inappropriate to force it, or it may cause undesirable consequences. (2) In view of the deteriorating international accounts of Japan, it is currently necessary to prevent capital outflows as much as possible to avoid increasing concerns about the lack of domestic funds and the imbalance of international accounts. The above methods are of great concern because they are closely related to Japan's future economic activities in North China. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 18th)

### Spanish Rebel Army Besieges Bilbao Urgently

Outlying Defenses Fall One After Another, Defending Troops Prepare for a Last Stand

⊙ Bilbao Front Line Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent: The Nationalist Army is besieging the city very urgently. The government army plans to make a last stand in the city, having placed landmines everywhere and set up obstacles in the streets in preparation for street fighting. After the outlying heights fell one after another, the government army occupied the strategically important Mount San Barnabo. The Nationalist Army has also begun to attack, but the government army is resisting strongly. It is rumored that the government army has withdrawn from the nearby town of Urdina.

⊙ Bilbao: The Spanish Civil War is about to enter its twelfth month. Today, the largest battle in the history of the civil war took place. The two armies fought for the high ground east of Bilbao without interruption. Although the Nationalist Army used a large number of aircraft and tanks to assist in the battle, hundreds of people died in repeated attacks. At the same time, all Basque government ministers except three went to various parts of the Basque Country on official business. All powers are now known to be granted to the Defense Committee composed of the Minister of Justice (representing the Basque Nationalist Party), the Minister of Industry (Socialist Party), and the Minister of Public Works (Communist Party).

⊙ Bilbao: The Nationalist Army broadcast a message saying that the villages and towns in the north, east, and south of the port of Bilbao, as well as the nearby mountains around the port that were regarded as natural barriers, have been captured by the Nationalist Army one after another.

⊙ Bilbao: The troops belonging to the Nationalist Army and the Italian mercenary army "Black Arrow Division" continued to advance along the Nervión River yesterday morning, and immediately occupied the village of Tiegeto. The government army also retreated to the opposite bank and made every effort to clean up the remnants of the army and reorganize their forces under the fierce artillery fire of the Nationalist Army. Until the afternoon, the Nationalist Army used heavy artillery and aircraft to start bombing Cape Bigostelucello. Later, at 6:30, the Nationalist Army finally captured Mount Aranzazu in a fierce attack. Therefore, among the high grounds outside the city of Bilbao, the government army only occupied the strategically important Mount San Barnabo. When the Nationalist Army climbed Mount Aranzazu, they rode on an aerial tramway. The government army had previously placed twelve machine guns in the gambling club in the mountain, and its shape was almost the same as a fortress. The Nationalist Army attacked repeatedly without success, so they used artillery and aircraft to bombard it fiercely until a three-engine aircraft dropped a giant bomb and razed the club to the ground. The Nationalist Army was then able to continue advancing straight to the mountain peak. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 18th)

### German Foreign Minister's Visit to England and Italy Expresses Concerns

Fearing to Shake the Rome-Berlin Axis, Hoping to Restore Four-Power Cooperation

[London] News has recently been received from Rome that although Italian newspapers outwardly express approval of the German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to England, there are still some concerns. Italy is deeply concerned that Britain's insistence on ordering Germany to lift its restrictions on Spain and no longer provide assistance to the Spanish Nationalist Army will cause disagreements between Germany and Italy on the Spanish issue. Because the Spanish incident is related to Italy's prestige, it is difficult to give up halfway. As for the main issues in Europe, Italy is also afraid that the attitudes of Germany and Italy will be difficult to reconcile. In addition, when the Italian Ambassador to England, Grandi, met with Foreign Minister Eden yesterday, he told the Foreign Minister that Italy supports Neurath's visit to Britain for talks. This move will enable the four countries of Western Europe, England, France, Germany, and Italy, to conduct diplomatic talks again, and the purpose of the talks is to establish a system in which the four countries dominate European affairs. However, the British side frankly stated that it could not recognize this view. British diplomatic circles solemnly stated again tonight that any new Locarno Convention should only be regarded as the first step in establishing a general agreement, and the general agreement must include issues in Central and Eastern Europe, and the result must not weaken the friendship between England and France and the collective security system. Therefore, after Neurath comes to England, there will not be any immediate results, and the British government does not want to immediately restore the negotiations on the new West European Convention, because the solution of the West European issue is closely related to various important economic issues.

### The Little Entente Strengthens Unity

Abiding by Alliances to Maintain Territorial Security, Three Prime Ministers Issue Communiqué After Talks

⊙ Yugoslav Capital: The authorities of the Little Entente countries, namely Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, Czech Prime Minister Hodža, Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu, and Foreign Minister Antonescu, had a lengthy discussion on the Danube River yesterday and issued a communiqué afterwards stating that the authorities of the Little Entente countries, after discussing various political and economic issues in detail, have proven that their opinions are the same and are willing to strengthen the mutual relations between the three countries by adjusting the economy, developing cultural relations, and promoting international cooperation. The political goal of the three countries is still to maintain peace and maintain the security of the territory of the three countries within the scope of existing alliance treaties and good-neighborliness. Regarding the cooperation between the countries in the Danube River Basin, it was decided to continue to act in unison to promote its success. The Covenant of the League of Nations remains unwavering in its adherence by the Little Entente countries. Any amendment that cannot strengthen the principles of the Covenant will definitely not be accepted. In addition, it was decided to hold similar meetings in rotation in the three countries of the Czech Republic, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The unity, consolidation, and viability of the Little Entente have been confirmed in this meeting. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 18th)

⊙ South Country Capital: Prime Minister Stojadinović returned here today after talking with the Prime Ministers of Romania and the Czech Republic on a yacht on the Danube River yesterday. The initial impression gained by the general public is that the people of South Country still support the Little Entente. When the cruise ship was cruising on the river, the people on both sides of the river cheered and paid tribute to the authorities of the three countries. In the political circles of South Country, it is said that the united unity of the Little Entente countries, their adherence to the Covenant of the League of Nations, and various alliance treaties, and their respect for existing good-neighborliness and existing international obligations have all been reiterated. In addition, the authorities of the countries focused on the following issues during the talks: (1) The case of the high-ranking generals of the Soviet Red Army betraying the country and the possible impact on the European situation; (2) The issue of Hungary's rearmament. Regarding this level, the Little Entente countries are prepared to grant Hungary equal rights, but on the condition that the Hungarian government provides security guarantees. If Hungary unilaterally abolishes the military restriction clauses of the Treaty of Trianon, the Little Entente countries will immediately abolish the clauses in this treaty that are beneficial to Hungary; (3) The Czech Prime Minister's plan for economic cooperation between the countries in the Danube River Basin has been endorsed by the authorities of the Little Entente countries, and it is believed that the interests of all major countries (including Germany and Italy) should also be taken care of; (4) Regarding the German Foreign Minister's recent visit to South Country, Prime Minister Stojadinović explained the significance and role of this trip, and said that South Country's approach to Germany does not have any impact on the Little Entente.

### Hydraulic Engineering of Dujiangyan

— Geng Ya

The Dujiangyan project doesn't stop there. After the Inner River and Outer River separate and flow a little downstream, you reach another major project, the Feishayan Weir. This weir is two meters high and also has a water-surging function. That is, if the Inner River's flow is excessive, any water exceeding two meters can overflow and return to the Outer River. However, this dam has always been extremely prone to collapsing, especially in April and May, precisely when rice seedlings need water. It is imperative to rush repairs, otherwise, the person in charge of the water conservancy project will at least be subject to detention.

In front of the Feishayan Weir, ancient people buried iron stakes. Each year when dredging, the iron stakes must be visible as the standard, and the weir is built two meters high to ensure sufficient water. Furthermore, each year, if the water overflowing the weir exceeds four meters, the Outer River basin will suffer flooding. There is also a small "Water-Scooping Dam" and a "Rolling Water Dam," both made by filling bamboo cages with stones, what is called a gabion, to force a moderate amount of water to flow into the "Baopingkou" (Bottle-Neck Entrance). The Baopingkou is carved from stone cliffs, with a water gauge placed beside it. Splashing waves fly like snow, striking the rocks with thunderous roars. Entering the Baopingkou is the "Lidui" (Separated Mound) carved by Li Bing, with a stone pillar standing alone and unfallen, called the Elephant Trunk Rock. Below the mound is a deep pool. Beside the rock is also coiled a large iron chain, said to be where the evil dragon was locked. The water势 flows down from the cliff, turning and impacting against the cut wall, pouring out from the Baopingkou at an extremely fierce rate, directly in front of the Lidui. Boats and rafts are very prone to danger. The rock chains may be for climbing.

In the past, the person managing the Dujiangyan project was called the Water Conservancy Magistrate. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), it was renamed the Water Conservancy Bureau, with a provincial scope. Therefore, a Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Project Office was attached to exclusively manage the Dujiangyan project. The project is divided into major repairs and annual repairs. Major repairs should originally be done every three years, but after the founding of the Republic, it was only repaired once in the fourth year of the Republic (1915). From the year before last until this year, it was resolved to carry out a major repair with a budget of over 600,000 yuan, but in reality, fundraising has been difficult. Last year, only 140,000 yuan was used, and the project was barely completed. It is said that as long as the annual repairs are done well, the major repairs can be postponed for several more years.

Looking back north from the mountain rope bridge, in the lush and beautiful mountains and forests, there are several courtyards of temples and monasteries, layered and emerging among them. One large courtyard is called "Erlang Temple," which is dedicated to Erlang, who succeeded his father Li Bing in controlling the waters. On the stone tablet in front of the gate are engraved the key points of river management, saying, "Take advantage of the momentum to guide, adapt to the times." It also says, "Deeply dredge the滩, build the堰 low," a six-character principle for thousands of years. "Dig the river sand, build the embankment, build the fish mouth, set the sheep pen, erect the湃闕 (i.e., Feishayan), leave the leaking can (referring to opening holes in the bottom of the weir to release water), weave the cages densely, equip the stones sturdily, divide four and six, balance the drought and flood (flood: outer six, inner four; dry season: outer four, inner six, i.e., based on the amount of 榪槎 removed). Water painting symbols (referring to the water gauge), see the iron stakes (i.e., dredging must see the iron stakes). Diligently repair annually to prevent disasters, respect the old system, do not arbitrarily change." Beside it are also engraved the numbers "Cut fish at the bend, extract the heart on the right day." On the Lidui, there is another Li Bing Temple, and the temple appearances are all very solemn.

After the tour, we returned to Guanxian and then to Chengdu for some arrangements. Then we set off from Chengdu to Kunming. The Min River (i.e., Dujiang), surging from the northwest mountains, reaches Guanxian, just at the upper water inlet of the Chengdu Plain. From here downwards, it can directly flow for thousands of miles, flooding several counties. Before the Qin Dynasty, when the Dujiangyan was not built, human power could not control nature, and the floods of the Min River were very fierce. During the Qin Dynasty, Li Bing and his son, the prefects of Shu, built the Dujiangyan, benefiting fourteen counties. Therefore, after transplanting rice seedlings each year, the people of Shu slaughter sheep to worship and celebrate, with as many as 50,000 sheep.

The route to visit Dujiangyan is to exit the west gate of Guanxian, pass through Zhenyiguan and Fenghoulou. The sound of the river flowing is滔滔, growing louder as we walk. After crossing Zhangfeiyan, walking west along a shaded slope, we see the Anlan Rope Bridge spanning the river high in the sky. The bridge is made of ropes, which are made by twisting bamboo, thick as the mouth of a bowl, arranged in nine strands, and covered with wooden planks. From this shore, it pulls to the other shore, spanning three to four hundred steps. On both sides, bamboo ropes serve as railings to prevent danger. Below, there are several pillars, three to four丈 high, supporting the soft drooping tendency. Pedestrians walk across smoothly, with a slight sway. If several Yi people carrying charcoal come from the opposite direction, deliberately jumping and running, you will feel a violent bump. People in the past have already sung, "Wind flutters, rain sways, the river is a belt, the rainbow is a waist. I stand momentarily on the bridge, the heavenly ridge shakes, the water roars. Dizziness and blurred vision, heart and胆 split, the bridge does not shake itself, people shake themselves. Others tell me the magical诀, look east and west, the heart turns fearful." Indeed, it is like this. This bridge needs to have its bamboo ropes replaced once a year, costing over 10,000 yuan, which is quite a bit. However, if you want to build a stone bridge or an iron bridge, first, there is no way to raise millions of yuan. Second, the water is too rapid, and the衝力 is too great. Even if you could build it, you could not guarantee a few years of safety.

Standing in the middle of the bridge, looking along the river in both directions, the Dujiangyan project is laid out before your eyes. First, climb high to get a general view, then inspect closely to understand the structure of all the projects. Under the bridge, a flat, fish-back-shaped堤 is built to face the flow, called the "Dujiang Fish Mouth," also called the Renzi堤 or Jinzi堤 because it resembles the Chinese characters "人" and "金." The Fish Mouth divides the river water into two, the left flow is called the Outer River, which is the main flow of the Min River, and the right flow is called the Inner River, which is the source of the fourteen counties' water channels. During the Ming Dynasty, this 堤 was often washed away, so first an iron turtle weighing 18,000斤 was cast to鎮壓, but it was washed away the following year. Later, a two-bodied iron cow weighing 70,000斤 was built, but it was also washed away, showing the猛勇 of the water power and the difficulty of building this 堤. A major repair was carried out incompletely the year before last, and the new 堤 was built, costing 80,000 yuan.护脚笼 are placed beside the 堤. No one can guarantee how many years it will last. The "Dujiang Fish Mouth" has the "Baizhang堤" on the upstream left bank and the "Water-Scooping Dam" on the right, forcing the water to the mouth, and then dividing the flow inside and outside. Every year after the winter solstice, a kind of material called "榪槎" must be used to cut off the water and flow it into the Inner River in order to挑灘 and repair the embankments of the Outer River. Before the beginning of spring, the Outer River is opened and the Inner River is blocked in order to allow construction on the Inner River. The 榪槎 is made of tripod frames, placed one against the other in the river, and then "標籤," "花欄," "捶笆," "簟蓆," and "黃泥" are layered and stacked inside to form the Inner River 榪槎. The opening of the Qingming Festival is a grand ceremony. The Director of the Construction Department, the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and representatives from other high-ranking officials and counties all come to watch the ceremony on this day.

### Dispute over County Magistrate Qualification Examination in Hubei Province

Wang Sichang and Others Accuse the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Illegal Conduct; Internal Supervision Department and Court Simultaneously Investigate

Hankou Dispatch: The Hubei Provincial Government held a county magistrate qualification examination last month. Generally, those with county magistrate qualifications were required to register and participate, totaling over 200 people, most of whom had served as county magistrates. After a physical examination, written test, and oral examination, 31 were selected. When the results were announced, public opinion was in uproar. Some people, including Wang Sichang, who had passed the Examination Yuan's review of the county magistrate examination, and over 50 others, including Zhou Jigeng, who had pre-secured a passing grade for county magistrate, jointly filed a complaint with the Control Yuan and the Ministry of Interior, accusing Meng Guangpeng, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, of examination fraud and dereliction of duty, requesting an investigation. Simultaneously, they formally filed a lawsuit with the Wuchang District Court. The Ministry of Interior has approved sending personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, while the Control Yuan has been tasked to the Lianghu Control Commissioner's Office, which sent a secretary to the Civil Affairs Department to review the files and collect evidence, appearing very busy. The court also attaches great importance to this case. However, considering that the county magistrate qualification examination is organized by a separate committee, the illegal conduct should not be blamed solely on the Director of the Civil Affairs Department. They intend to issue a decision not to prosecute. After the lawyers Yang Zehua and Li Deyi, hired by Wang Sichang and others, presented their reasons and requested a review, the prosecutor personally went to the Civil Affairs Department to review the files and conduct an on-site investigation, and will likely summon individuals for questioning within a few days. The reasons provided by the plaintiffs are roughly as follows: "The defendant, in charge of the county magistrate qualification examination, ㊀ did not base the results on the written test. For example, Chen and Cai, among others, scored only 30 to 35 points on the written test, yet their scores were secretly changed, allowing them to enter the passing list, while those who genuinely passed were rejected. ㊁ The results were not based on the oral examination. For example, Xiong and Yuan, among others, did not utter a single word, yet they were ranked at the top, while those who spoke fluently were not selected. ㊂ The results were not based on their performance in office. For example, Lu Shigugu, the former county magistrate of Baokang, was praised by the provincial government as the "most capable official in the province" after performance evaluations, and was explicitly commended. Wang Sichang was commended by Chairman Chiang with a telegram saying "loyal, courageous, and resolute" for his efforts in suppressing bandits, all with documented records. This time, they were rejected solely due to a three-minute oral examination. This shows that the examiners purely determined who to select based on the strength of the lobbyists." The plaintiffs' publicly stated reasons are briefly summarized here. This case is of great significance to the future of Hubei's officialdom. With the administrative, supervisory, and judicial aspects conducting thorough investigations, it is expected that there will be a fair resolution. (June 16th)

### Major Construction Projects in Gan: Water and Electricity

Construction Costs 3 Million Yuan; Entire Project Nearing Completion

Nanchang Dispatch: Nanchang City has a population of 300,000. Municipal construction has made considerable progress in recent years. However, the city's water supply still comes from rivers and wells, which is inconvenient and unsanitary, especially for emergency fire prevention. The city government has specifically planned to establish a water and electricity plant. All capital, in addition to requesting an investment of 1.3 million yuan from the Construction Silver Company, will be raised by the province itself. Last year, after signing a contract with the company, water and electricity machinery, water pipes, and various materials were ordered from Jardine Matheson, costing 1.8 million yuan. The plant site is located on the east bank of the Gan River, north of the Zhengzheng Bridge. Construction began in February and is now largely complete, costing over 210,000 yuan. It is estimated that all expenses after completion will reach approximately 3 million yuan. The factory's equipment and water pipes in various roads and streets are being rushed to completion, and it is expected to be completed in about two days. The general situation of the two plants is recorded as follows:

Power Plant

The city's existing power supply is insufficient. Therefore, a generator is being set up at the water plant, and its water pumping is utilized to make the water supply meet economic conditions. The boiler for the machine is a Babcock & Wilcox water-tube type from the UK, with three units, each with a heating surface area of 2,960 square feet, a steam output of 14,200 pounds per hour, a steam pressure of 385 pounds per square inch, and a steam temperature of 770 degrees Fahrenheit. The steam turbine generator is a product of the British Electric Company, gear-driven, with one unit of 1,100 kW, a speed of 7,000 revolutions per minute, and one unit of 2,100 kW, a speed of 6,000 revolutions per minute. The steam pressure and temperature are the same as the boiler. The voltage is 2,300 volts, the frequency is 50, and it can generate 3,000 kilowatts. Two-thirds are used by users, and one-third by factories. If factories develop in the future, it can be expanded at any time.

Water Plant

The water source is taken from the Gan River. Two centrifugal pump with motors are used to pump the water to a mixing pool. After continuous water flow, the solid matter in the water gradually settles down, flowing to the alum pool. After the alum is mixed with water, it is put into a coagulation sedimentation pool. After a considerable amount of time, a chemical reaction occurs, the渣滓 settles to the bottom of the pool, and the clear water is then quickly sand-filtered to make it clear. The filtered water is then disinfected and sterilized with chlorine and ammonia, and then four centrifugal pumps, driven by three-phase induction motors, are used to send it to the factory, with an output of 370 cubic meters per hour, and to the water tower in the city center, from where water pipes run to various users. All users are equipped with water meters, and the water price is 2 jiao 4 fen per degree. In the future, each household will need to pay a deposit for the water meter, a water absorption fee, and water pipe installation fees, which will cost dozens of yuan. Given the current economic capacity of the citizens of Nanchang, it may be difficult to make it widespread.

In the summer of 1931, he was appointed Council Member of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, abided by the law, maintained integrity, and worked diligently for the public. The Chinese and foreign directors relied on him deeply. He was particularly devoted to the education of Chinese people within the settlement, such as increasing the number of bureau-established schools and expanding subsidies for Chinese private schools, which were effective. (Currently, the number of students in the bureau-established schools within the settlement has increased from 3,000 to over 10,000.) He has also made many contributions to improving the welfare of Chinese people within the settlement. He was particularly considerate to poor citizens within the settlement, such as peddlers and棚戶. Recently, due to his outstanding performance, he was promoted to the position of Deputy General Manager.

Mr. He's Remarks

The Central News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. He at the Public Works Department yesterday afternoon. According to his statement, Dequi has been working in the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement for six years.

Fortunately, there have been no shortcomings. As Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department, he will continue to work hard in the past spirit to seek the welfare of the local area and hope that people from all walks of life, Chinese and foreign, will provide guidance from time to time to correct his shortcomings. According to the usual practice, the Public Works Department is granted three weeks of leave each year. Dequi has used this time in past years to visit Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces to inspect and deeply understand that under the guidance of the central government, all major aspects of politics, economy, education, and transportation in various provinces are making rapid progress. Since Chairman Chiang promoted peaceful unification, there has been even greater progress.

The eighth regular meeting resolved to accept this. The stock has already been exchanged. The remaining half of the debt amount was given as interest-free bonds to be cleared in five years, with July as the deadline each year. The Xinkang Money Shop's deposit of 2,097.90 yuan was fully cleared by Sun Bosheng, a shareholder of the money shop, in installments. Although the lawsuit against Yikang Money Shop's debt was judged by the First Special District Local Court to be cleared, the case has been suspended due to the lack of shareholders to be responsible for the liquidation and cannot be carried out. This is reported as above.

### Envoy to Denmark Wu Nanru Departed Yesterday

Brief Stop in Moscow Before Proceeding to Denmark; No Change in Sino-Danish Diplomatic Relations

Wu Nanru, the envoy to Denmark, who had requested leave to return to China to report on his duties, has now completed his leave and departed last night aboard the Northern Steamer of the Hongyun Shipping Bureau, heading to his post via the Soviet Union. Mr. Wu made a statement before his departure, which is recorded below:

Sailing Last Night

Mr. Wu, accompanied by his wife and the newly appointed embassy staff member Wu Junyuan, departed from the Jianghai Customs Wharf at 4:30 PM, taking a company launch to board the ship. Zhou Jue, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Tang Shixuan, secretary of the City Government, Lull, the Danish Consul-General in Shanghai, Mei Lanfang, the famous performer, and Mr. Wu's relatives and friends, all went to the wharf to see him off. Leaders of various organizations and groups also presented flower baskets to wish him well. The ship set sail from the Longmao Wharf in Pudong at 6:00 PM in the evening.

Remarks Before Departure

Mr. Wu, before his departure, made a statement, saying that since returning to China on March 30, he has been here for two and a half months. During that time, he had been to Beijing, Hangzhou, Lushan, and his ancestral home in Yixing. He originally intended to go to North China, but he did not have enough time. In all the places he visited, he felt that the people's thinking and local construction had made considerable progress compared to a few years ago. He was very excited by what he saw. This phenomenon is a good sign of national rejuvenation. Therefore, he hopes that the people will continue to work hard and persevere. The country's position will surely be enhanced in a few years. He will go to his post in Denmark via the Soviet Union. He plans to stay in Moscow for a short time to retrieve his luggage left there and to visit Ambassador Jiang Tingfu. However, he has no mission. He expects to arrive in Copenhagen around the 8th or 9th of next month.

Sino-Danish Relations

As for the diplomatic relations between China and Denmark, there is no change because the two countries have always had friendly relations. The trade agreement was signed in 1886 and does not need to be revised. As for the relations between China and the Soviet Union, the two countries' diplomacy is also very ordinary. The so-called Sino-Soviet non-aggression pact is just speculation because there is no need to sign such a pact between the two countries. As for the situation of the Soviet Union's purge, it seems very serious. The news is very complicated, but the facts may not be as bad as reported.

To Be Held at 1 PM on the 26th

### Hearing on the Case of the Haili Steamer Hitting a Reef Began Yesterday

Ordered the Shipowner to Submit a Supplementary Written Report to the Ministry; Rumors of Haiheng's Disappearance Originated from Hong Kong

The hearing on the case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's state-owned Haili steamer hitting a reef was organized by Cai Zengji, General Manager of the company, Deputy Manager Shen Zhongyi, Chen Zhaoji, Director of the Shipping Department, Deputy Director Zhou Houkun, Zeng Guangqing, Director of the Business Department, Feng Feng, Chief of the Maritime Affairs Section, and others at 10:00 AM yesterday. Cai served as the chairman. The captain of the Haili, Teng Shibiao, and the first, second, and third mates of the ship were summoned to the company to inquire about the circumstances of the incident and what happened on the spot. The captain Teng gave a detailed account of the facts on the spot and what was recorded in the logbook (the same as the account of the incident published in this newspaper yesterday). Next, the third mate on duty reported, and his statement was similar to that of the captain. Then, Cai, Shen, and others questioned them one by one and ordered the captain to submit a supplementary written report to be forwarded to the Ministry for instructions. According to the service personnel on the ship, after the Haili set sail, there was a passenger in compartment No. 20 who brought a dancing girl. After the ship set sail, the passenger made trouble in the dancing girl's room. The service personnel tried to dissuade him, but the passenger became angry. Unexpectedly, when he arrived in Shanghai, he blamed the incident with the dancing girl on the crew. Furthermore, for the past two days, there have been rumors in this port that the Haiheng has disappeared again, causing panic. The company has certified that this is completely unfounded. The ship is currently sailing from Little Luzon. It is said that this rumor originated in Hong Kong and seems to have been spread by someone to confuse the public. The Haili is scheduled to enter the Dongjiadu Old Shipyard for repairs at 10:00 AM today.

### Japanese Consulate Police Arrest Japanese Communist Party Cadre

Using Alias Gan to Come to Shanghai; Contacting Korean Independence Party Activities

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the police of the Consulate General discovered that someone had recently started secret activities. Someone using the alias Gan had sneaked into Shanghai as a cadre to rebuild the Japanese Communist Party. After the Consulate authorities received a designated search warrant from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, they immediately transferred it to the relevant authorities and deployed a serious search network throughout the city. Because Gan could not be active in Japan, he sneaked into Shanghai and was reportedly in contact with the Korean Independence Party in Shanghai and Nanjing.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Expresses Views on Demands by Marine Engineers for Improved Treatment

Currently Studying in Detail and Submitting to the Ministry for Approval; Employees Should Serve Peacefully and Await Resolution

The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently received a letter from the China Marine Engineers' Joint Association, in which all marine engineers on the company's ships demanded improved treatment. The company is discussing the issue of salary increases for personnel in the driving, engineering, communications, and navigation departments and has requested the Ministry for approval. Many marine engineers are reasonable and should serve peacefully and await resolution. A letter to marine engineers was specially issued yesterday, and a reporter from the New News Agency has excerpted it as follows:

Obey Orders and Sacrifice Personal Views

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-owned shipping organization directly under the Ministry of Communications. All employees directly serve the company, which means serving the country and should be subject to government decrees. If there is any conflict with government decrees, it should be absolutely sacrificed. Marine engineers hold important positions on ships and cannot focus on personal interests while disregarding the interests of the state's business. Employees are members of the public, and serving in state-owned organizations is also being an owner of the company, sharing responsibility with the managers. The managers represent the government in implementing decrees. The marine engineers, as employees and owners, should not only obey the government decrees implemented by the company and do their best to maintain them, but also have the responsibility to supervise whether those above are doing their best to implement them and whether those below are obeying orders.

Improper Behavior May Not Be Beneficial

Since the company began a thorough rectification of its affairs in the spring of last year, it has been more than ten months. During this time, the accumulated malpractices of the ships have been eliminated, and the cooperation of the crew has been seen. Most of the marine engineers are also the backbone of supporting the government and promoting the rectification plan, but there are also some with wrong ideas and flawed actions. For example, some crew members of the Haiheng used coercion overseas to demand higher treatment, and the main elements were the marine engineers. Recently, more than a dozen marine engineers resigned themselves to demand higher treatment, which has been disapproved by the company. All such behaviors are inappropriate and should not have been done by marine engineers who share weal and woe. The company has been observing the unreasonable actions of the marine engineers and may be due to incitement by others. However, the intentions of those who incite are not only to destroy the state's transportation business, but also may not be beneficial to the marine engineers themselves. The marine engineers should think deeply about it.

Salary Focuses on Knowledge and Experience

Since the reorganization of the company, we have been proceeding with the development of business and the improvement of personnel management. The issue of crew treatment has never had special regulations. We have also drafted the regulations on the treatment of driving, engineering, communications, and navigation personnel, taking into account the Maritime Law and the actual situation of the company, and submitted them to the Ministry for approval. These regulations have been revised separately for salary grades, rewards and punishments, advancement, retirement, and pensions. Special attention has been paid to the crew's knowledge and experience and their service performance. Before the approval and implementation, the company has appropriately increased the treatment of some captains, and is also preparing to give reasonable salary increases to other driving, engineering, communications, and navigation personnel. The salaries of the marine engineers are slightly lower than those of the driving personnel, but there are special reasons for this: ㊀ Throughout history, most of the marine engineers serving on ships, except for a few who graduated from specialized schools, have been promoted from craftsmen. ㊁ Those promoted from craftsmen have considerable experience and superior work efficiency, but lack theoretical knowledge of mechanical operation. ㊂ Those who graduated from schools have good knowledge, but mostly focus on theory and lack experience. They are also not accustomed to operation, which affects work efficiency. Therefore, the treatment they enjoy has to be slightly lower than other technical personnel. However, according to the company's current treatment, it is better than other shipping companies. The marine engineers should examine themselves and not be sacrificed by external temptations.

Request All Points to Ministry for Approval

The company's responsibility is to implement government orders and cannot neglect respecting national discipline and maintaining the company's business. All employee petitions that do not hinder discipline and business can be considered and accepted. Otherwise, no matter what the sacrifice, we will not hesitate. The marine engineers have now submitted five requests to the company through the China Marine Engineers' Joint Association. The company will study these requests based on the above-mentioned principles and the actual situation, and will also report the situation to the Ministry of Communications for approval. However, the company deeply feels that this request exceeds the current salary by more than 40%, which is not within the company's financial capacity to bear. Foreign merchants account for 70% of the domestic ship tonnage, while the domestic only account for 30%. If domestic ships increase costs too much by raising treatment, they will lose their competitive effectiveness, which is not a blessing for the country. Furthermore, in terms of the principle of improving the treatment of marine engineers, those who are not from specialized schools but have mechanical knowledge can be treated the same as those from schools with experience. At the same time, personnel from specialized schools must have considerable experience to enjoy the highest possible treatment. Among the above two types of personnel, if knowledge and experience are not both available, this highest treatment cannot be given.

### City Joint Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Urging Speedy Construction of Public Housing

To Accommodate Demolished Shantytown Residents

The City Joint Association of the First Special District sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you directly. The association previously suggested that your council build public housing to accommodate the demolished shantytown residents and the general public, fearing that the shantytown residents would be displaced from now on, as your council planned to demolish the shantytowns in stages. Now, the phased demolition of shantytowns has been implemented, and at the same time, there is a proposal to order the demolition of attics built by residents within the boundary, which further highlights the need to plan for the construction of public housing as soon as possible. Therefore, we are writing to urge you to pay attention to the difficulties of the public in living and design and build public housing as soon as possible."

### Liu Ruiheng Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Eradicating Plague in Fujian

### Douglas Jumbo Jet Shipped from U.S. to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon

To develop its business, China National Aviation Corporation ordered two Douglas jumbo jets from the United States last year. It was learned yesterday that one of the aircraft was shipped to Shanghai on the CladFrek freighter of the American Trading Company at 11:30 AM yesterday. The ship docked at the Huangpu Wharf. The aircraft is the same as the company's current twin-engine Douglas, with an original capacity of 18 passengers. To make passengers more comfortable, it has been converted to 14, making the interior wider than before for ease of movement. The aircraft can reach a speed of over 200 kilometers per hour. The company is currently going through customs and other procedures to extract the aircraft so it can be transported to Longhua Airport for installation. Once installed, it will be added to the Shanghai-Ping or Shanghai-Chuan routes.

### Shanghai-Ping Long-Distance Telephone Added Booster Phone Trial

This morning, personnel from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau told the Hua Dong News Agency that the Shanghai-Ping telephone was used with a "booster" last night to re-test the speech, as the sound was not clear in previous tests. The result was much better than before. The date of the call will be determined by the Ministry of Communications.

### Vice President Kong Concerned About Relief for Disaster-Stricken Children

According to the Central News Agency, since last autumn, the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan have not had a single drop of rain. The people are struggling to survive, the fields are cracked, there is no green grass in the wilderness, and there are wails everywhere. All resources have been exhausted, and grass roots and tree bark have become treasures. Holy soil and wild corpses are used as food. The miserable and tragic situation is truly like a hell on earth. The children in the disaster areas, known as the second generation of the nation, can't escape the disaster and die with the adults. This is not only a human tragedy but also a major misfortune for the country and society. The China Children's Relief Association, responsible for children's relief, has drafted a concrete plan to relieve the disaster-stricken children, planning to establish 15 disaster-stricken children's shelters in the disaster areas of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan, with an annual cost of over 100,000 yuan to seek thorough and complete relief. The association will telegraph Vice President Kong, who is traveling in Europe, to raise huge sums to implement the association's plan to relieve the disaster-stricken children. The association has received Vice President Kong's telephone approval to proceed with the proposal. Therefore, the China Children's Relief Association immediately appointed Deputy Secretary-General Chen Tiesheng to fly to the disaster areas on the 16th to carry out the work of relieving the disaster-stricken children. Before Mr. Chen's departure, he received a telegram from Vice President Kong, urging him to report the disaster situation in detail at any time and continue to assist in the implementation.

Led by Zheng Binzhao, Director of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and the delegation leader, they are scheduled to depart from Shanghai this morning at 10:00 AM on the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Guangdong route ship "Hai Zhen." Yesterday afternoon, a delegation meeting was held to discuss various preparations before departure.

### National Trade Bureau Notifies Merchants to Directly Order Foreign Goods

Taking a 30% Profit in One Transaction

The National Trade Bureau, upon receiving a dispatch from the Ministry of Industry in response to a consultation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on a report from our country's Consul in Hamburg, Germany, stated: "The cargo stipulated in the bills of lading signed by this Consulate include German goods produced in Germany, goods from other countries exported through Germany, and goods from other countries not exported through Germany, but transshipped to China en route. The third type of goods is mostly ordered by our country's import merchants from Germany, and German merchants then purchase them from manufacturers in other countries to meet the needs of our country's import merchants. An investigation reveals that the profits taken in this one transaction often exceed 30% of the manufacturer's original selling price. If our country's import merchants could order directly from the manufacturers, the purchase price could be reduced by more than 30% of the manufacturer's original selling price. Statistics show that the annual amount of goods purchased through German merchants is very large. If direct orders could be placed with the manufacturers, it would undoubtedly benefit the country's import merchants. Therefore, we request that the Ministry of Industry be consulted to issue an order to our country's import merchants to find ways to order directly from the manufacturers, in order to benefit commerce." After receiving the order, the National Trade Bureau specifically notified all merchants across the country yesterday to take note that when purchasing raw materials or semi-finished products from foreign manufacturers, they should order directly from the producers to avoid inflated prices due to intermediaries and to ensure that the goods purchased are actually produced in that country.

### Chamber of Commerce Notifies of Measures to Sanction Non-Membership in Trade Associations

Proceeding with Advice First, But If Unheeded, Penalties Will Be Imposed According to the Administrative Execution Law

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce notified all trade associations in the city yesterday: "With reference to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's instruction, Municipal Document No. 16020, which references the Municipal Government's instruction No. 1004, which references the Executive Yuan's instruction, Land-3096, which references the Central Executive Committee's Department of Mass Training's letter sending measures to sanction companies and firms that do not join trade associations or pay membership fees, please treat these measures as a temporary solution and instruct the provincial and municipal government offices to refer to them, etc. Upon this, the measures sent are deemed feasible.

### Shanghai-Operated Pudong Water Plant Begins Supplying Water Today

Design and Construction Took Two Years

The Shanghai Municipal Government has been continuously striving for various construction projects in the urban area in recent years and has made significant progress. It has paid particular attention to the plan to prosper Pudong, such as building roads and expanding ferry lines, which have made the Pudong market present a thriving scene. Therefore, the daily necessities of Pudong's current land and water transportation, electricity, and telephones have generally been available. The only shortcoming is the lack of tap water facilities. The Municipal Government, in view of this, ordered the Xingye Trust to actively prepare for it. After receiving the order, the company worked hard to carry out a meticulous plan. It took two years, and it has now been fully completed and is scheduled to officially supply water today (the 19th). A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special trip to visit yesterday. The details are recorded below:

General Information about the Facilities

The Pudong Water Plant is located on Youlong Road in Pudong, approximately across the river from Avenue Edward VII, and is located in the center of the most prosperous area of Pudong. The plant base occupies a very large area. The pump room is located at the entrance of Youlong Road. The water level there is very deep, making it the most suitable water source in Pudong. All the buildings inside the factory are of the latest design. In addition to the above-mentioned water intake pump room, there is a sedimentation tank, a rapid filtration tank, a clear water tank, and a clear water pump room, all of which are steel-reinforced concrete structures and have been treated to prevent leakage. The clear water tank is sealed with steel-reinforced concrete and Sando soil, and is equipped with fifteen vent pipes to ensure that the water quality remains absolutely clean. There is also a water tank dedicated to washing the rapid filtration tank. The alum feeders, chlorine feeders, and various chemical testing instruments are also all of the latest type. The chemical testing equipment is particularly complete and novel. The office is also quite spacious and clean. The machines used in the factory are all powered by electricity, making them highly efficient and easy to manage. There are two mixed water motor pumps in the water intake room. When taking water, there is first a fish-eye steel mesh to prevent the inflow of fish, and then a copper wire mesh to prevent the absorption of coarse sand. There are two clear water motor pumps in the water outlet room. It is also heard that the factory has now added a chlorine gas machine to the clear water room to ensure complete safety. In total, the Trust has invested approximately 800,000 yuan in national currency in various construction facilities.

Water Production and Testing

The mixed water sucked in by the water intake room is added with an appropriate amount of dissolved alum water in the alum addition room by mechanical force and then sent to the sedimentation tank. The sedimentation tank has separate compartments with cement boards to block the smooth flow of water, so that the mixed water with added alum can gradually settle down after undergoing a winding path. When it reaches the rapid filtration tank, the water quality is as clear as a mirror. After being filtered by sand, it gathers in the clear water tank and is disinfected and sterilized by adding chlorine gas using a chlorine gas machine before being output by the clear water pump room. The factory spares no expense in purchasing the latest and most accurate instruments for water quality testing and hires specialized technicians to specialize in water quality testing. Every day, the mixed water from the Huangpu River is first tested to know the amount of sand, mud, and bacteria contained in the water, so as to determine the amount of alum to be added. The mixed water is tested again after sedimentation and sand filtration to determine the various components contained in the water and then re-tested to determine the amount of disinfectant. After disinfection, a bacterial examination is performed again to prove whether the disinfectant is appropriate. Before the official water supply this time, in addition to the factory's chemical testing engineers testing the water quality themselves every day, water samples are also sent to the Health Testing Institute of the Health Bureau for testing every day. They have now fully passed the test. The water pipes on each road are flushed day and night with disinfected clean water. After the chief of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, Bureau Chief Xu, specially sent the responsible section chief, Section Chief Zou, to the factory to inspect each part in detail and pass the test, he approved the water supply. Because the factory is city-run, the water quality must be absolutely clean in order to protect the health of the citizens, so it must be extra cautious.

Water Supply Area

The water supply area of the factory is currently tentatively set from Tangqiao in the south to Qichangzhan in the north. It is heard that the second step is to extend to Bailianjing in the south and Yangjing Town in the north, which is expected to be implemented soon.

### Public Concession Bans American Film

Film Title "Shanghai March of Time"; Claim that the Film Contains Anti-Japanese Sentiment

The new film "Shanghai March of Time" of the American R.K.O. film company has been reviewed and approved by the Central Film Censorship Board and is scheduled to be screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater next Sunday. However, the company's representative in China suddenly received a notice from the Public Concession Police Department yesterday, stopping the screening. The reason for the ban is that the film contains anti-Japanese sentiment. It is heard that the Public Concession Film Censorship Board reviewed the film again at 3:00 PM yesterday, but the results have not been announced. According to Mr. Brighton, the director of the company in China, "The content of the film involves Japanese people" has been completely deleted. However, the police department insists on deleting the narration of the film, because the narration clearly has anti-Japanese sentiment, etc. Mr. Brighton (as he calls himself) believes that if the narration in the film is deleted, the spirit of the entire film will be lost, so he did not agree to do so. The most strange thing is that the Japanese film "New Earth" was recently ordered to stop screening, but the police department actually sent police to protect it and continue screening it. Only for American films are they repeatedly making things difficult, "which is really incomprehensible," he said. According to reports, the film depicts the situation in Shanghai quite faithfully. In addition, there are faithful descriptions of our country's construction and the spirit of the army, etc.

### Dispute Between Old and New Workers at Huafeng Flour Mill

New Workers Were Heavily Armed, As If Facing a Formidable Enemy; Detectives Went to Suppress the Situation and Arrested Several People for Interrogation

The Huafeng Heji Flour Mill on Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, dismissed all workers after the last work stoppage. Recently, the factory needed to resume work, so Rong Binggen from Wuxi was appointed as the general foreman, and Wang Tingsheng from Anhui was appointed as the deputy foreman to recruit new workers. On the 16th of this month, they planned to enter the factory to start work. Unexpectedly, a group of old workers found out and went to the factory to make things difficult for the new workers. Although the factory tried to stop them, it was not only ineffective, but also led to disputes, followed by violence. As a result, factory staff and general foreman Rong Binggen, etc., were all injured. At that time, the Caojiadu Police Station, which was in charge, dispatched police to suppress the situation and arrested eight workers who were causing trouble, taking them to the station for investigation. However, the new workers were deeply afraid of being bullied by the old workers again. For self-defense, when they went to work at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Deputy Foreman Wang Tingsheng led hundreds of workers, each holding weapons such as iron bars, long guns, steel forks, and shoulder poles, gathering in the open space on Xiaoshadu Road and Macau Road, ready to resist if the old workers made things difficult. Unexpectedly, the Putuo Road Detective Station found out about it and was deeply afraid that the situation would escalate and lead to unfortunate incidents. Therefore, they immediately ordered Chinese Detective Zhao Bingkun, West Third Road No. 12, to supervise a large number of reserve team members to suppress the situation and ordered all workers to put down their weapons. The leader, Wang Tingsheng, was arrested. However, two other workers, Fang Houxian and Fan Shaoquan, expressed dissatisfaction and had a strong attitude, so they were also arrested. The rest of the workers dispersed. One long gun, two broadswords, one axe, two steel tridents, one iron bar, and 122 shoulder poles were seized and taken to the detective station for safekeeping. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Detective Station Lawyer Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 150 of the Criminal Law on the crime of disturbing order, and stated the facts of the case. According to the West Police No. 12's complaint about the situation at the time of the arrest, the defendants claimed that the workers brought these weapons for self-defense and there was no violence or coercion. Lawyers Fan Gang and Gu Yongquan were also hired to defend them. Judge Chuan Lin verified the confessions and sentenced Wang Tingsheng to two months in prison for openly gathering a crowd with the intention of violence or coercion. If execution is difficult, the sentence can be commuted to a fine at the rate of one yuan per day. Fang Houxian and Fan Shaoquan, who assisted in the scene, were each fined ten yuan. If they are required to serve a labor sentence, the rate is one yuan per day. The weapons were confiscated. During the appeal period, Wang paid a bail of sixty yuan, and Fang and Fan each submitted a bail of ten yuan to be released.

### Elderly Woman Hit by Bicycle Dies of Illness After Examination

At about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, at the intersection of Jiaotong Road and Gonghexin Road in Zhabei, an elderly woman, Yao Zhang, 79 years old, was walking through the area when Gu Asan passed by on a bicycle, causing the elderly woman to injure her arm. Yesterday, the elderly woman suddenly died at home at No. 22 Zhonghefang, Jingjiang Road. Bao Zhang reported to the Xinzha Branch Bureau and local constable Shen Xiaowu, who reported to the Shanghai Local Court for examination. At 5:00 PM, Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang was dispatched to clarify that Yao Zhang died of illness. In addition, an unidentified male corpse, about 30 years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, was found dead in Deshunli, Changan Road. Prosecutor Jiang also clarified that he died of illness. Because there was no family to issue a certificate for burial, local constable Shen Xiaowu prepared a coffin for burial.

### Re-arrested Suspects in the Case of the Bodyguard Squad Leader's Tragic Death for Thorough Investigation

As Many As Eight People, Including Gong Yifei, etc.; The Deceased's Fiancee Was Also Among Them

Lu Hongde, who lived in Gong's Residence No. 13, Lincoln Road, and served as the squad leader of the Second Squad of the Pusan District Bodyguard Corps, committed suicide with a rifle in bed at 2:00 PM on March 23rd. He died on the way to the hospital. The local court dispatched a prosecutor to examine the body. As a result, it was determined that there were signs of murder. However, the deceased's parents were both deceased. Only his grandmother, Lu Chen, his eldest brother, Lu Hongkang, his second brother, Lu Dadi, his eldest and second sisters-in-law, and the deceased's fiancee, Lu Ruzhu, who had been raised in the family since childhood, were not yet married. Therefore, the prosecutor initially summoned seven people, including Gong Yifei, the inspection director of the Bodyguard Corps, platoon leader Cai Hegen, the deceased's eldest and second brothers and sisters-in-law, and his fiancee Lu Ruzhu, to the court for interrogation. Everyone confessed that the deceased committed suicide. Gong Yifei provided a guarantee, and they were all released together. After the prosecutor conducted a detailed investigation, Lu Hongde was indeed murdered. Therefore, he re-summoned and detained the seven people, including Gong Yifei, and stopped their visits. The prosecutor's office believed that the deceased's eldest brother, Lu Hongkang, the deceased's fiancee, Lu Ruzhu, and the tenant Zhao Yingou were more suspicious and sent them to the City Police Bureau's Detective Team for strict interrogation. They then transferred the suspects Lu Shulin, Lu Chen, Lu A-mei, Lu A-ya, Zhao Wei, Lu Quansheng, Lu Yongsheng, Lu Wenan, and Lu A-lin, etc., to the court after the Detective Team led them for strict interrogation. The prosecutor interrogated them separately. As a result, except for Lu Shulin, Lu Chen, Lu A-mei, Lu Yongsheng, Zhao Yingou, Lu A-ya, and Zhao Wei, who were released, Gong Yifei, Cai Hegen, Lu Dadi and his wife, and Lu Ruzhu, Lu Quansheng, and Lu Wenan, etc., a total of eight people, were detained for thorough investigation.

### Sun Shaoqing's Appeal Judgment

The Five-Year Prison Sentence Remained Unchanged; The Ratio for Commuting to Labor Service Was Slightly Changed

Sun Shaoqing from Tongzhou, because he had been soliciting lawsuits in recent years and using intimidation to make people hand over property, making a profit of up to 100,000 yuan, was reported by someone. Lu Liankui, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the Public Concession, and Detective Liu Shaokui arrested Sun and sent him to the First Special Court. After interrogation by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Sun was sentenced to five years in prison, a fine of 1,000 yuan, and deprivation of public rights for ten years. His wife, Sun Zhu, was also sentenced to one year in prison at the same time for committing perjury. Sun and his wife were not satisfied with the judgment and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The interrogation has been completed, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled date for the verdict. Mr. Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the Bureau of Works, also attended the court. Later, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, accompanied by Judges Peng and Xiao, took the bench in the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The original judgment regarding the part of the fine to be commuted to labor service was revoked. The amount of the fine to be commuted to labor service for Sun Shaoqing was determined by a ratio of 1,000 yuan to six months.

### Arrest and Sentencing of Heroin User to Twelve Years

Tang Wanzhong from Yangzhou, at 10:20 AM on the day before yesterday, was found lying on a straw mat at No. 808, East West Huade Road, using the drug heroin to satisfy his addiction instead of opium. He was discovered by Chinese constable No. 945, who arrested him and brought him, along with a clay teapot, a small opium pipe, a candle, and a small packet of heroin, to the Huishan Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, prosecuted him according to Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Offenses, requesting severe punishment. Constable No. 945 then reported the circumstances of the arrest, presenting the evidence for examination. The defendant confessed to using heroin for a year, needing to buy a small amount for three small ocean silver coins from a vendor on Huaji Road every day.

### Robbery of Central Automobile Company Vehicle Yesterday

Stolen in Xinmin Village, Zhongshan Road; Found in Tonghe Li, Hutai Road

At 6:20 AM yesterday, a man suddenly went to the Central Automobile Company at No. 259, Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, to rent a passenger car. He stated that he would pay three yuan for a round trip to Dachang Town. The company immediately dispatched driver Chen Guilin (34 years old, from Nantong, residing at No. 240, Meixie Road) with a dark green sedan, city license plate No. 4370, rental permit No. 12453. While passing near Xinmin Village, Zhongshan Road, in Zhabei's Hutai Road, the passenger ordered the driver to stop by the side of the road. Four men jumped out. One robber had a dark face, wearing a black Xiangyunsha short shirt and pants, one wore a blue cloth short shirt and pants, appearing as a copper worker, one wore white twill short shirt and pants, and one wore a gray cloth long gown. The robber who had been on the car beforehand was wearing a blue silk long gown. They all spoke with a Jiangbei accent. They brandished two pistols. Two robbers, each holding a pistol, ordered Chen Guilin to get out of the car. They watched him walking slowly by the side of the road for about forty-five minutes. The three robbers then got back into the car and said to Chen, "Friend, please help. Don't make a sound. Be sensible. If you make a sound, or tell people about this afterward, we will shoot you. We are borrowing your car today to get revenge on someone. We haven't found him yet," and so on. The five robbers then drove off quickly in the car. Afterward, the driver separately reported to the Tanziawan and Pengpu Town police stations, asking them to track down the robbers, and at the same time reported to the Central Automobile Company by telephone. At around 11:00 AM, the car was suddenly discovered on Hutai Road (next to the west side of the former Hutai Automobile Company's main station entrance, Tonghe Li). According to the second team members of the Pengpu Defense Corps at that location, the car had been parked there since around 8:00 AM. No one was watching it, causing suspicion. They reported to the team headquarters for investigation and found out that it was the Central Automobile Company's car. They immediately notified the company by telephone to verify. The team then prepared a document to send the car to the Xinzha Sub-bureau for disposal. At around 6:00 PM in the afternoon, reporters went to investigate. The car was still at the team headquarters' entrance of Qiaoxing Li. The car was intact, without any damage.

### Arrest of Main Culprits in Major Robbery at North Station

Victim is Fubing, Manager of Silver Shop - Twenty-one Large and Small Diamond Rings Stolen

Fu Bing, the manager of the Xinbaocheng Silver Shop in Wuxi, intended to return to Wuxi by train at 12:45 PM on February 8 of this year. While buying a ticket at the North Railway Station, he had no idea that a thief would steal four large diamond rings, seventeen small diamond rings, fourteen yuan in cash, and twelve aviation lottery tickets, worth a total of two thousand two hundred yuan, from his pocket and escape. Fu reported the theft to the local police station and requested an investigation, but the case had not been solved until 11:15 PM the night before last. Wang Chengying, the Chinese detective chief inspector of the Public Concession's General Inspectorate, and detective Qian Xianting, arrested Wu Dingqing, a Shaoxing native, related to the case, at the intersection of Route Robert and Gordon Road. Wu confessed that the main culprit was named Lu Youyuan, also known as A Gen, residing at No. 100, Lane 427, Xiaoshadu Road. The detectives rushed to the location and arrested Lu and his wife, Wu, together. The diamonds and other items they had stolen had already been completely sold, and from the proceeds, they had borrowed out 2,140 yuan. The remainder was used to purchase a pair of gold bracelets and three gold rings, which were all searched and seized by the detectives, along with the IOUs, and brought back to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that Fu Bing had not yet been notified, and the jurisdiction of the case also needed to be determined after investigation, so he requested that the case be postponed. When questioned, Lu Youyuan confessed to stealing Fu's diamonds, etc. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, verified the confession and ordered a postponement for further questioning in one week.

### Publishing Director of Guangyi Bookstore Requests Punishment for Copyright Infringement

Zhu Xinzhi, 30 years old, from Shaoxing, is the publishing director at the Guangyi Bookstore at No. 137, Henan Road. Recently, a book entitled "Essentials of Eloquence for Beginners" (初學論說精華), written by Jia Ding Ling Baojun and with parallel translation of Classical and Vernacular Chinese, published by the bookstore in the third year of the Republic (1914), has been selling very well in Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces. It had been registered with the Beijing government and obtained copyright protection. Recently, because the book was no longer suitable for modern times, it was revised and re-registered with the central government. Unexpectedly, someone surnamed Fang, a native of Zhenjiang, residing at No. 4, Mujuli Lane, Zhaojia Road, brazenly pirated the book, claiming it was published by Guangye Bookstore, and also pirated the bookstore's "A Guide to Essays for Beginners" (初學論文指南), selling them widely, causing the sales of Guangyi Bookstore to decline. Zhu investigated and purchased two copies of each of the pirated books, and reported to the local City God Temple police station, requesting a search and severe punishment. The police immediately dispatched officers to make arrests, but only arrested Fang's wife, Ms. Wang, for questioning. The case involves copyright infringement and has been transferred to the court for legal action.

### Silk Weavers’ Strike Ended, Union Activities Suspended

Meiya General Factory and Jingwei Factory Resume Work Today; Party and Government Agencies Send Personnel to Monitor Workers’ Return to Work

Dagongshe reports: The city’s party and government agencies, handling the silk industry labor unrest, have arrested the main instigators one after another. They have also jointly issued a proclamation, ordering all workers of the Meiya General Factory and Jingwei Factory to return to work by 6:00 PM today. Details are as follows:

Meiya and Jingwei Factories Resume Work This Morning

The Meiya General Factory and Jingwei Factory on Rihui East Road in South Shanghai, after failing to resume work on the 13th of this month, have been ordered by the party and government agencies to resume work immediately. It is learned that after personnel were sent to inspect and repair the machinery in the two factories yesterday, it was decided that they would resume operations as usual at 6:00 AM this morning. All workers of the two factories have also decided to return to work. The city’s party and government agencies, in order to prevent further disputes, will send personnel to supervise along with the police bureau.

Silk Weavers’ Union Suspends Activities

The industrial unions of the silk weaving industry in the First District (Nanshi), Third District (West Shanghai), and Fourth District (Hongkou) have experienced repeated labor unrest due to the incompetence of their leaders, which could not be resolved. In order to eliminate disputes and reorganize the union organizations in the three districts, the city’s party and government agencies have ordered them to suspend activities. The city party headquarters will send personnel to reorganize them after the labor unrest is completely resolved.

### Chamber of Commerce Petitions City Government and Police Bureau Not to Detain Accusers

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday stating: “Petitioning regarding a matter: Our Chamber has received a letter from the Shanghai Umbrella Trade Association stating that disputes often arise between people, or when they are subjected to infringement, they call the police. The police bureau, without investigating whether there is a reason for both parties, detains them all and sends them to the General Bureau. For example, in the case of our member, Sanxing Factory, in July of last year, due to a neighbor's dislike, they accused them of obstructing hygiene and requested they relocate. Later, our chamber petitioned the City Party Headquarters, Social Bureau, Health Bureau, and City Chamber of Commerce, and received approvals from the competent authorities stating that there was no obstruction and no need to relocate. Unexpectedly, a few days later, the Ximen Sub-bureau arrested the factory manager, Ma Zhiwen, without reason and sent him to the General Bureau for detention for a day. Later, our chamber sent a document and dispatched personnel to the bureau to explain, and although he was released, he lost a day of freedom and suffered unwarranted injustice. Furthermore, in September of the same year, our member, Huanqiu Factory, experienced a strike by workers without reason, and the workers gathered to obstruct the business and act violently. The police were called, and the violent actors were detained. Our chamber sent a document and dispatched personnel to meet with the chief of the Laobeimen Police Station, requesting a fair and strict handling of the matter. Chief Shen immediately said that if they wanted to severely punish the defendants, the accuser (referring to the manager of Huanqiu Factory) must accompany them to the station to listen to the questioning and be sent to the bureau together the next day. Otherwise, it would be impossible to handle the case. However, the factory manager believed that this approach would result in a loss of business and irreversible suffering in terms of mental, practical, and time costs. Furthermore, they would have to be detained in the same place as the perpetrators. Due to various reasons, they had to swallow their anger and answer that they were unwilling to accompany them. As a result, the workers were not brought to justice and safely escaped punishment. In summary, in the first item, the case of Sanxing Factory being reported for obstructing hygiene had already been approved by the competent authorities, stating that there was no obstruction and permission not to relocate. However, the bureau rashly detained them for half a day or a night. Although they were released later, the injustice they suffered was irreversible. Taking a step back, even if the police bureau had doubts about the accuser, they should order them to comply with the formal legal procedures. They should not exercise arbitrary actions during the period of political tutelage. In the second item, the case of Huanqiu Factory's workers going on strike without reason, gathering to obstruct business, and acting violently, had already been witnessed by nearby police officers. The factory manager also provided a detailed report, and the Chamber provided written proof. The facts were clear. However, the bureau not only did not deal with the current offense but also stated that they could not handle the case unless the plaintiff was detained at the same time, forcing the plaintiff to suffer the same detention and stigma as the defendant. The plaintiff found this unbearable in terms of emotion and reason. As a result, the plaintiff's grievance was not addressed, and the defendant's crime was released. Therefore, when there is an infringement, they are willing to endure it, fearing being detained in the same detention center. The perpetrators, knowing that they will not be brought to justice and aware of the plaintiff's weakness of not wanting to be detained together, act even more recklessly. If this continues, even if legitimate merchants encounter major grievances, they will inevitably fear reporting to the police. How can human rights be protected? How can national law be protected? Therefore, we request your association to petition the municipal government to order the police agencies to not detain accusers in the future. If the accuser's report is untrue, they can investigate the accuser's household registration address, whether they are a legitimate merchant, and order them to provide a guarantor to ensure that they are available for questioning at any time. They must not be detained pending trial. If they evade their obligations after providing a guarantor, the guarantor can be held responsible or fined accordingly. Therefore, the association believes that when merchants report or report to the police bureau for any reason, the police bureau detains them without regard to the circumstances, causing the accusers to suffer from detention before the accused is brought to justice. This is unfair to the legal principle. The association’s request is to protect human rights and prevent cunning individuals from attempting wrongdoing. It is reasonable to present the facts to your government and request approval to order the bureau to comply. This is in the public interest.”

### Excavation and Destruction of Ancestral Graves and Sale of Tomb Bricks Leads to Charges

Shi Qixiang and Shi Bosheng, natives of the area, jointly owned ancestral graves and earthen mounds at Xiaoxujiatang, Caohejing. In December of last year, Shi Bosheng, due to extreme poverty, colluded with Yi Haiyun from Baoying, Jiangbei, and Xu Wennan from Taixian, to excavate and destroy the ancestral graves, and sell the tomb bricks, worth 1,300 yuan, after discarding the remains. Upon learning of this, Shi Qixiang reported it to the authorities, who arrested Shi Bosheng, Yi Haiyun, and Xu Wennan and transferred them to the local court. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against them based on Article 249, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang opened the court to hear the case. Shi Qixiang testified that he lived at No. 9, Hexingfang, Foch Road, because we are all doing business in Shanghai, and the ancestral halls and tombs are all in Caohejing. He only learned of this when the clan reported it during the spring festival. He also retained a lawyer to file a civil suit seeking compensation of 1,300 yuan. When questioned, the defendants all admitted the crime. The court debate concluded, and the verdict will be announced on the 21st of this month. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits Receiving Stolen Electrical Wire

Strict Punishment in Court Upon Discovery

The municipal government considers electrical and telephone poles and wires to be related to national defense and military and political communications among provinces. Recently, they have been stolen by bandits, disrupting traffic and having a huge impact. It has repeatedly ordered its subordinate police teams to seriously pursue and protect these items. All criminals involved in stealing or damaging communications equipment will be handed over to military law agencies to be punished according to the Provisional Measures for Punishing Bandits. These theft cases have slightly decreased. Recently, the municipal government received another order from the central government to thoroughly eliminate theft cases, strictly prohibiting the receiving of stolen goods and ordering strict investigation and seizure. Upon discovery, they will be sent to the court for severe punishment to maintain traffic efficiency. The order has been conveyed to the subordinates for compliance.

### Murder Suspect in Robbery Case in Pudong Arrested in Shanghai

Chen Tingzhang, owner of Huamei Electric Materials Company on Fuzhou Road, residing at No. 187, Yangjiazai Road, Pudong, was attacked by eight or nine robbers wearing masks and wigs at around 3:00 AM on May 4th of this year. The robbers climbed over the wall to carry out a robbery. Chen's eldest son, Chen Jiating (21 years old), attempted to resist with a shotgun, but was shot and wounded by the robbers. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the robbers scattered and fled. Chen Jiating died due to injuries to his waist. By 1:00 AM of the night before last, Wang Jiaju, a Chinese detective chief of the Laozha Police Station, and detective Liu Zhaotian, learned that Zhang Pingjiang, a local suspect in the case, must pass through the intersection of Guangxi Road and Guangdong Road. They went to wait and subsequently saw Zhang and a Suzhou woman, Zhao Jüzhen (20 years old, residing at No. 8, Lane 67, Mahuo Road), coming. They were arrested. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the case, stating that many more important criminals are still being pursued by the police, so he requested permission to detain them for further questioning. Tang Yinqiao, a servant of the victim's family, testified that Zhang was indeed holding a gun at the scene at the time. Zhang firmly denied it. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and ordered Zhang to be remanded in custody, and Zhao was granted bail of 100 yuan. The case was adjourned for further questioning.

### Embezzlement Case of Former Clerk of the First Special District Court Suspended

Defendant Chen Zongyu at Large

Chen Zongyu, former clerk of the Shanghai First Special District Court, after falling out with his wife, Qi Huizhen, lived with a prostitute, Wang Lanzhen, leading to lawsuits such as the capture of adultery. Later, the Civil Court ruled that Chen and Qi should be divorced. Recently, Chen has been practicing law, while Qi has filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court, accusing Chen Zongyu of embezzling money from Yang Jifang, owner of Puda Pharmacy, and Huang Huaishēng, owner of Jinan Film Company, during his tenure as a clerk. Prosecutor Song Genshan opened a court to investigate and ordered the arrest of Chen Zongyu, but to no avail. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Prosecutor Song has now filed a public prosecution against Chen Zongyu with the Criminal Court of the same level on charges of dereliction of duty and embezzlement. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye of the First Criminal Court heard the case. Chen had not yet been arrested, so the court summoned Qi Huizhen to question her about the facts of the accusation (which have been reported in detail before, so they are omitted). It is said that he has fled to Japan. Judge Qian stated that because Chen had not yet been brought to justice, it was difficult to proceed and that the case should be heard after the wanted notice was served. Therefore, he ruled that the trial proceedings be suspended.

Talking Points

### The Lack of a Way to Health

— Shen Jiaqian

It's summer, and everyone is thinking about "hygiene." All "people" hope to "live to be a hundred years old." As for speculation and downfall, unemployment and jumping from buildings, although there is much more to them, it's simply because they cannot "live long" that they lightly hand their lives over to the King of Hell. Therefore, when a child is born, they must ask a blind fortune teller to break through the "gate of misfortune"; if they are still unlucky and die young, they will chop at the corpse a few times, hoping to get compensation in the second child; it also means "starting over."

These are all "general ideas." Although there was once a saying, "Human determination can overcome Heaven," it is ultimately quite forced. Thus, to supplement the insufficiency of "Heaven's will" is "human effort"; and this includes "the way of hygiene."

However, "the way of hygiene" each has its own "way." Members of the "Centenarian Society" have their self-made "secrets to health," such as "do more things, get angry less." This "secret" can indeed sometimes make people live long. The example right before our eyes is that they were able to participate in the "Centenarian Society." But there are also those who wanted to "do more things" and lost their lives: Ji Shenghong, who was competing to load lead wire at the dock, "ruptured his intestines and died an unnatural death" (see yesterday's newspaper). "Get angry less," you say? It's just that young people lack the ability to restrain themselves. At the slightest disagreement, they immediately resort to violence. First, there was the incident on Nanjing Road of drinking from a public water tap, and then there was the "glorious bloodshed" of customs officers. However, their ease of "getting angry" is also for the sake of—hoping to live long—not for "personal" benefit but for the "public good." This is perhaps something the inventors of the "secrets to health" did not think of.

This is the first point.

The second is the "secrets to unhealth." Taking ginseng and bird's nest in the morning, getting blood-boosting injections in the evening. Fortunately, they have plenty of money and wish they could gather all the supplements in one body. But they don't understand their own constitution or where the root of the illness lies. By the time they need to prescribe a "prescription," it leaves "all the doctors helpless." This is called "self-inflicted misfortune," so it's better not to say anything.

Most pitiable are those who have "no secrets to health." They are clearly "physically weak and suffering from hemoptysis," but when they "see a slight improvement," they feel that "the family has no property and needs a skill." So, through a friend's introduction, they go to a certain electrical appliance store on Fide Road to learn the craft of installing electric lights, which leads to "the old illness recurring, causing extreme pain." Thus, they "suddenly come to a realization" and jump from the fourth floor of the Great World (see yesterday's newspaper). This is another example.

Having written this far, I could have stopped. But, suddenly, I thought that in addition to these three, there is another category that belongs to forced hygiene. Although it has strayed further and further from the topic, it cannot be left unsaid. To give a recent example, it is the people living in attics. The Municipal Council insists on forcing them to be "hygienic" and demolishing their homes. But do they not know "the way of hygiene"? With this slice of health coming in early summer, they have already moved to the sidewalks to rest, with the blue sky as their quilt and the earth as their bed.

However, what worries people is that news of car accidents will also follow.

In a nutshell: "There is no way to health!"

### Opinions on "Wu Zetian"

— Taisheng

(1) Miscellaneous Discussion of the Script

Judging by the effect of this performance and the level of acting, it is much better than "Romeo and Juliet." At least, the individual acting skills of the actors are very average, unlike "Romeo and Juliet," which is focused solely on two people.

As for criticism of the entire script, historical dramas like this are inherently difficult to write because, for this kind of costume drama, we cannot completely rely on the ancients (and there is no way to verify), nor can we imitate old plays. If the actions are too modern, it will definitely hinder the atmosphere of the historical drama.

Take the point of "dialogue," for example, and you can see the difficulty the playwright had in writing this script. For example, in Act IV, which depicts Wu Zetian's licentious harem life, the "dialogue" between Wu Sansi and Wu Chengsi seems a little too "pedantic": In Act II, when Wu Zetian uses tricks on Emperor Gaozong, she refers to Gaozong as "you" and herself as "I," which is completely inconsistent with the full-mouthed "Your subject" and "Your Majesty" of Emperor Zhongzong later on. I believe these places are not the author's textual negligence, but rather the author's indecision on whether to make it colloquial or to keep its original historical appearance.

Even taking the role of Emperor Gaozong as an example, under the author's and director's emphasis, this "Son of Heaven" of a dynasty has been completely "clownified." Especially in Act III, Gaozong kneels to Wu Zetian, and Wu Zetian wears a crown while Gaozong kneels prostrate at Wu Zetian's feet. In our opinion, even if an emperor is昏庸, he would not be

## Page 20

昏庸 to this extent.

(2) "Abnormal" Wu Zetian

Looking at the core of the script, the playwright Song Zhi said that this is: "In a traditional feudal society—that is, a male-centered society—the resistance and struggle of a woman."

What is Wu Zetian like under "resistance and struggle"? She despises men, she tries her best to retaliate. This "hysterical," abnormal woman deliberately tortures men, insults men, and hates men. Therefore, some people say that this script has "the danger of being written as the opposition between women and men."

But I think that Wu Zetian can only be regarded as an "abnormal" figure in history. We must never use modern ideas to punish "Wu Zetian" because, in a traditional feudal society, she naturally excludes others and wants to seize power herself. Because she deeply hates men, she deliberately insults them.

If the script really wanted to write about the "opposition between women and men," then Wu Zetian would never have killed Empress Wang.

(3) Acting and Stage Design

The reason why I want to discuss the actors' acting skills and the stage design together is that the amateur stage design has indeed surpassed the level of all Chinese theater troupes.

In general, the stage design abandons extravagance and gorgeousness and tends toward clarity and simplicity. For example, in Act II, before Wu Zetian appears, the audience immediately applauds when they see such a clear and beautiful stage, which is rarely seen in previous performances.

Now let's look at a few actors: Ying Yin's Wu Zetian is already as good as it can get. Her composure and refinement firmly grasp the character of Wu Zetian in the five acts. Her deep planning, her mad laughter and anger, her seizure of power, her stubbornness and strength—she is truly a rare talent among Chinese actresses.

There are many other actors who can act well, such as Zhang Manping's painful and tragic Miaozhen; Gu Eryi's cartoonish clownish Emperor Gaozong; Xiong Hui's flirtatious widow Lady Han; and Lv Fu's loyal minister Xu Cungong. They are all extremely successful and lovable actors.

Ye Luxi's Miaoyu seems to be deeply influenced by Zhao Dan's style, especially in the first act. I hope she can find her own way. Lv Ban's Xue Huaiyi is ultimately too over the top. Wang Ping's old nun is still good.

Speaking of actors, we are mostly satisfied. The music is better than last time, and the lighting effects are exceptionally beautiful.

The entire performance is best in Acts I, II, and III; Act IV is a little worse; and Act V is a failure.

Writing ramblingly, this is not a criticism but only my own impressions after watching.

The Second Comment by Li Yi

It is not easy to write a critique of "Wu Zetian." First, at least the critic should read more historical materials about Wu Zetian and compare them with the script to see if there are any distortions or arbitrary points. Second, one should read the script several times and carefully study it to see if there are any characters or events that should be added or deleted. Regarding these, I am not qualified to do, and I think it is definitely not something that one or two people can do. A fair evaluation of it can only be handled by collective efforts, perhaps through a symposium.

Now, writing "impressions after watching" is naturally different from "criticism." But it's still not easy to please. This work is especially difficult for me. However, it may be worthwhile to write a little, hoping to gain something from a thousand thoughts. If there is a symposium in the future, then it may as well be considered a few questions raised.

Director Shen Xiling has already told us about the biggest difficulty in staging historical plays: "We have no way to verify the actions and habits of the characters at that time. We are neither willing to flow into the type of Beijing opera with sleeves and stroking beards, nor can we presumptuously add modern actions." This is really a "headache" thing. To solve this difficulty, I think, we may as well assume that there is a standard and then follow it as a goal to do it: in this way, the performance can be unified. If it is not good, it can be corrected in the next play. Like this performance, what I feel is that the actors' actions have not tended to be uniform. For example, I felt that the actions of Ye Luxi and Yan Gong were modern and somewhat Westernized. The former, especially in the first act, that action is extremely should be changed.

Regarding the theme of this play, I generally agree, but I don't know why, intuitively, I always feel that the author is faintly setting up the opposition between men and women; this is probably because my understanding is too weak, so I can't say why. This kind of feeling is of course not very strong, and I only hope that this is my prejudice, but if it is true, then I hope to find a way to avoid it, because the future society is definitely not a

the rejection of both sexes, but the cooperation of both sexes.

In the original script (published in "Women's Life"), there was the role of Shangguan Wan'er, but it was gone when it was staged. There are also additions and deletions in other places. Whether Shangguan Wan'er should be deleted is not discussed here, but from the perspective of "drama," I think the existence of Shangguan Wan'er can make it more lively, especially in the fifth act, it must be more lively than it is now. As for the final climax, I think the effect would be better if a fire were set afterward, but I don't know if there is any discrepancy in time.

Regarding the stage design and lighting, I think it is shameless to describe them with the words "unprecedented." The actors' acting skills are also very average and very outstanding here. Ying Yin's Wu Zetian not only surpassed the plays she had played before, but the other actors also had amazing achievements, such as Zhang Manping's Miaozhen and Xiong Hui's Lady Han. Although they have very few scenes, they give you an unforgettable impression here. This is really the most suitable and equally matched cast.

### Woods and Fields

— Wang Rendong

This is an early summer morning, and I am walking alone in these woods and fields.

The blue sky is revealed from the gray clouds and sifts down through the branches and leaves at the bottom of the trees. The feather-shaped leaves at the bottom of the locust trees sway left and right like rings hanging on a woman's ears when a breeze blows. Beetles chirp in the grass under my feet, and the chirping sound is a backdrop to the tranquility of these woods and fields.

Black butterflies fly gracefully like paper ashes; the silk spun by spiders shines in the sunlight and stretches to the branches.

White, rice-shaped wildflowers are scattered over the green grass. I kick aside the weeds, and dew wets my shoes. Occasionally, a gray rabbit darts past me and disappears into the deep grass...

The weather is gradually turning gloomy. An old and seasoned turtledove hums a rain-inducing song in the distance. I found a stone tablet next to a puddle and sat down on it. This puddle was originally formed by the accumulation of rainwater in the low part of the mountain. The light green water surface reflects the sky sifting through the gaps in the leaves, and some leaves that have fallen from the locust trees above float on it.

A gust of breeze: the leaves at the bottom of the locust trees are swaying like earrings again.

The sky is even gloomier, and no clear sky can be seen from the sparse gaps at the bottom of the trees. All that can be seen is the dim, gray clouds. The sound of the beetles has subsided; the breeze only comes every now and then. The turtledoves are also reluctant to call out any more. At this time, only a turtledove on a nearby tree suddenly coos! Coo-coo, deeply, like the sound in an old man's wheezing throat. Coo! Coo-coo!

This entire mountain forest, this entire green mountain forest, this gloomy mountain forest, is called to death by it. — Only depression permeates here. However, this taste of peacefulness, flowing into my heart.

When I came back, I plucked some locust pods from the locust tree; they were green, some slightly tinged with red; I want to take them home, I let them grow such woods and fields, such depression, darkness, and greenness of these woods and fields in my heart. However, among them, I must also have some seeds of hope hanging on those branches, like these locust pods.

### Shen Bao Entertainment Supplement Dance Art Special Issue Encourages the Dance Art World

— Bo Qiao

Ge Tian invented singing, and Yin Kang invented dancing. Singing and dancing have a long history in our country. It is said that when examining major ethnic groups around the world, whether they are civilized or uncivilized, they all have their own national songs and dances. The love of music and the love of singing and dancing are human nature, and it seems that human power cannot stop them.

Now, let's put aside singing and talk about dancing. All the major advanced ethnic groups in the world have their own styles that are suitable for their national character. The United States is a country of liberalism, and its style contains the meaning of freedom. France and Italy love art, and their style can express beauty everywhere. Germany and Russia have a strong national character, and their postures and movements are enough to express their fortitude. The British people have always regarded themselves as born favorites. From the gentry to the common people, they all regard themselves as gentlemen in clothes and hats. Therefore, their actions are gentle and elegant. Each has its own unique national character style, and each is suitable for its own needs. Why must they all be the same?

Since the European War, countries have adopted the British style of social dance, which is free, elegant, and generous. That is, the so-called standard style has become popular all over the world in less than ten years. However, they can still maintain their own national character, and each adds or subtracts and transforms it with its own characteristics.

Our country is a land of clothing, etiquette, and courtesy for thousands of years, and its characteristics seem to be the same as those of the United Kingdom. We should follow the trend and adopt the British style. However, we sincerely hope that our country's dance art circles will work together to learn from others' strengths and overcome their weaknesses, and further transform them, just as when we learn calligraphy, we first copy the model, and after we have mastered the essence, we may as well make slight changes and create a new style. This depends on the efforts of the majority of the dance art circles.
