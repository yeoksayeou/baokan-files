### Zhang Xueliang's Public Rights Not Yet Restored

Deprivation of Public Rights Begins From the Date of Autonomy and Pardon. Retention After Removal Implies the Idea of Making Amends for Sins. Nanjing.

Regarding Zhang Xueliang's main sentence, after it was explicitly pardoned by the National Government, many outsiders believe that the secondary penalty also no longer exists. The reporter specially visited experts from the Criminal Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan to inquire for their opinions. According to them, Zhang's secondary penalty, the five-year deprivation of public rights, was sentenced in accordance with Article 37, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The latter part of Paragraph 4 of that article also states, "Those who are declared deprived of public rights in accordance with Paragraph 2 shall have the period counted from the date of completion of the execution or pardon of the main sentence." According to this interpretation, it is obvious that the pardon of the main sentence should still lead to the deprivation of public rights. To seek the restoration of public rights, one should separately handle the procedures for restoration of rights in the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage. Subsequently, the matter of retention after removal was discussed. It is said that this type of punishment method is not uncommon in the political history of our country, implying the intention of making amends for sins. However, in the future, when those subjected to this punishment submit a report to the superior official authority, the four words "Retention After Removal" should be added to their title according to old custom to show the distinction.

### Wang Jingwei's Remarks Upon Passing Through Singapore

Saving the Nation Through Education. The Central Government Has Established a Plan. Only National Unity and Efforts Along These Lines Will Succeed.

[Singapore] Chairman Wang arrived in Singapore on the 6th from Europe and returned to the country on the original ship on the 7th. Before his departure, he made a statement, saying, "I was granted leave by the Central Government to recuperate, and over the past few months, I have gradually recovered. I originally planned to take a ship back to the country in mid-November of last year, but I was suddenly stricken with cholecystitis, which led to a postponement. In mid-December, I heard about the Xi'an Incident and was greatly distressed. I disembarked on the 22nd and received a telegram from Mr. Chiang on the 26th, informing me that he had safely arrived in the capital, which relieved me. Regarding the policy of saving the nation through education, the Central Government has a complete plan and definite steps. Since Mr. Chiang took over the administrative branch, the central government has been strengthened, national power has increased, and diplomatic responses have been handled appropriately. Only national unity and efforts along these lines will succeed. As for other issues, I intend to wait until I arrive in Nanjing to discuss them in detail with fellow comrades. At this time, I have no further opinions to express. Finally, regarding the assassination attempt on me, I would like to say a few words. Previously, because it concerned the judiciary and was in the process of being tried, I was unable to speak. Recently, I heard that the case has been adjudicated. I believe that I have no personal enemies in my life. In recent years, I have been in charge of administration, precisely when the nation has been facing internal and external troubles. Although I have exhausted my efforts, the hardships and twists are unknown to outsiders. If misunderstandings have led to violent acts, they may be somewhat excusable. After returning to Nanjing, I intend to request the National Government to generously pardon all those involved." (Central News Agency dispatch of the 7th)

### Zou Lu Discusses Overseas Impressions

[Nanjing] A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Central Executive Committee Member Zou Lu on the morning of the 8th and was received by him, and he broadly discussed his overseas impressions and opinions on national affairs. Zou first stated that he only stayed in Germany briefly this time and did not visit other countries for observation. He will only speak about the recent situation of the German Social Democratic Party. Their progress is admirable in every respect. There are two points that are most noteworthy: 1. The success of national physical training; 2. The cultivation of a national fighting spirit. The former is indeed the foundation of national prosperity and cultural construction and is worthy of our emulation. As for the latter, the focus on fighting spirit as the center of education is inappropriate. The clashes of the left and right, two major camps, in Europe all originate from this, so it is not something we should adopt. Zou next stated that after returning to the country, he saw that the nation is tending towards revival and that signs of turning points are appearing everywhere. He cited two notable points that prove this and are very optimistic for the future: 1. The prestige of the central government and Chairman Chiang has been established, and the people of the country all admire them. Even people from various countries around the world are very impressed. 2. The people have deeply understood and recognized the spirit of hard work and the policies pursued by the government and Chairman Chiang. Therefore, in the future, we should unite all comrades within the party, strengthen the party's power, and the party should earnestly lead the people to save the country together. Then the completion of the great task of revival can be expected soon. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)

### Amendments to the Organization Law of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission by the Legislative Yuan

Amendments to Articles of the Supervisory Yuan Organization Law; Resolution Passed that the Fisheries Law Does Not Require Amendment

[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan convened its 86th regular session on the morning of the 8th. 73 members, including Chuan Bingchang, were present. Sun Ke chaired the session, with Liang Hancao as Secretary-General. The following items were discussed: ㊀ A proposal to amend Article 11 of the Supervisory Yuan Organization Law was passed. ㊁ A proposal to amend the Organization Law of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission was passed. This proposal was based on the "Outline of Unified Yellow River Repair and Prevention Measures" and aimed to change the commission's powers. The key amendments are as follows: The commission is directly under the National Economic Council and is responsible for all beneficial and preventative measures related to the Yellow River and its tributaries, such as the Wei and Luo Rivers. The commission will have one chairperson and one vice-chairperson, specially appointed, and nine to eleven committee members, simply appointed. The governors of the provinces along the river will be ex officio members, jointly responsible for river defense and repair. They will assist the commission in handling matters related to the Yellow River within their respective provinces. The commission will be reorganized into three departments: General Affairs, Engineering, and River Defense. The Yellow River's course will be divided into three major sections, each with a repair and defense office, each headed by a director responsible for repair and defense. The organizational regulations will be determined by the National Economic Council. ㊂ A proposal to amend the Fisheries Law was resolved not to require amendment. This proposal arose because of the necessity of constructing fences and weirs for inland river fish farming, which often led to disputes due to Article 44 of the Fisheries Law. Local authorities found it difficult to handle such cases. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry advocated adding Article 25 after Article 24, stating that "inland river fish farms may, for the purpose of demarcating boundaries, apply to local administrative authorities for permission to construct fences or weirs, provided that they do not impede water conservancy or transportation." The Legislative Yuan considered that the intention of the proposed additional article was already covered by Article 17 of the existing law, and that the penalties stipulated in Article 44 required both the unauthorized construction of fences and the "blocking of fish passage" to be established. If fences are legally constructed to demarcate boundaries, no penalty would arise. It was deemed unnecessary to create a separate article. As for Article 40, regarding the removal, damage, or destruction of fishery markers, the Civil Code already provided for compensation for damages, so no amendment was deemed necessary. ㊃ The International Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in Adult Women was resolved to be postponed for approval. ㊄ The Convention Concerning the Use of White Lead in Painting Industry, ㊅ the Convention Concerning the Reduction of Working Hours to Forty a Week, ㊆ the Convention Concerning the Reduction of Hours of Work in the Glass-Bottle Manufacturing Industry, ㊇ the Convention Concerning Hours of Work in Coal Mines, ㊈ the Convention Concerning the Establishment of an International Scheme for the Maintenance of Rights Under Invalidity, Old-Age and Widows' and Orphans' Insurance were all resolved to be postponed for discussion. ㊉ The fourth supplementary budget for the 24th fiscal year's national ordinary revenue and expenditure was resolved to be approved as proposed.

### Interpretation of Concurrent Succession by the Judicial Yuan

[Nanjing] The Judicial Yuan hereby issues the following interpretation regarding the legality of adopted children adopting compound surnames when concurrently inheriting two lineages: Since Article 1078 of the Civil Code clearly stipulates that adopted children shall adopt the surname of the adoptive parent, adopted children may not concurrently use their original surname. If the original surname is added to the name, it can only be considered part of the given name and not a compound surname. While there is no explicit prohibition against concurrently inheriting two lineages, in accordance with the spirit of Article 1083 of the same law, it has no legal effect.

### Body of English Woman Found Near German Cemetery in Beiping

Somewhat Mysterious Circumstances; British Authorities Begin Investigation

[Beiping] Mr. Whineray, who served at the British Consulate in China, retired in 1914 and resided in Beiping. His daughter, Pamela, aged seventeen, suddenly died this morning. The circumstances are somewhat mysterious. The local police have taken notice. It is reported that her body was found at 7 a.m. this morning, about 250 yards from her residence, near the German cemetery, a very secluded area. The body had been partially devoured by wild dogs during the night, making it difficult to identify. Fortunately, her father was able to identify her by the remaining clothes. British authorities are expected to begin the investigation after receiving the results of a doctor's examination tomorrow. The cause of death is currently difficult to determine. It is said that the girl used to travel by bicycle. It is believed that she was on her way home from an ice-skating rink last night when she died. However, the bicycle is now missing. Because the area is along the city wall, several years ago, someone committed suicide near the German cemetery. To this day, local rickshaw pullers are afraid to travel there after sunset for fear of ghosts. Therefore, the body was not discovered until the next morning. It is reported that the girl's body was found in a deep ditch between the road and the city wall, where passing vehicles could not see it. Mr. Whineray only had this daughter and had been a widower for many years. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)

### Anhui Local Bank Provides Mortgage Loans for Rice and Grain

Interest Rate of 8 Per Mill Per Month; Maximum Term of Six Months

Wuhu correspondence: This year, the Anhui Local Bank will adopt a decentralized warehouse system in various counties and towns to provide convenient mortgage loans for rice and grain. After the Wuhu head office finalized these measures, it not only instructed its three branches and 34 county offices to implement them, but also obtained approval from the provincial government to issue an order to all counties to provide assistance. The measures are excerpted below: ㊀ Loans are limited to farmers and landowners who are directly involved in production. ㊁ The loan amount per household is limited to 30 national currency units. ㊂ The loan interest rate is 8 per mill per month, calculated daily for periods less than one month. ㊃ The loan term is a maximum of six months and may be repaid before the due date, with interest calculated based on the number of days of the loan. However, a late payment penalty of 2 per mill will be added. In special circumstances, if an extension is agreed upon with the bank, the penalty will be waived. ㊄ The collateral is limited to rice, grain, and other agricultural products. The collateral per household shall not exceed 3 dan of rice or 10 dan of grain. Other agricultural products will be subject to the same standard. ㊅ When converting collateral into loan amounts, it shall not exceed 60% of the local market price. ㊆ To reduce the burden on farmers, the collateral may be stored by the borrower, provided that a joint guarantee certificate from five households is provided and the bank verifies and seals the goods. ㊇ Borrowers must complete a loan application form, along with the guarantee certificate and a sample package of the collateral, and submit them to the bank. After the bank has reviewed and verified the collateral, it will issue the loan based on the promissory note. The sample package of the collateral will be stored by the bank with a unique code and returned to the original borrower upon repayment of the loan principal and interest. ㊈ Before repaying the loan principal and interest, the borrower and guarantor must be absolutely responsible for the safe storage of the collateral and may not privately remove, sell, or break the seal. ㊉ If the borrower fails to repay the loan principal and interest by the due date, the bank may retrieve the original sample package, designate a location, and sell the collateral to repay the loan principal and interest. Any surplus will be returned to the original borrower, and any shortfall will be compensated by the borrower. ㊉㊀ These measures will be implemented on a trial basis for one year, after which they will be revised or abolished. ㊉㊁ These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.

### Japan Adjusts Relations with the Soviet Union

— Hua

According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Rengo News Agency the day before yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, in order to adjust relations with the Soviet Union, has decided to invite the Soviet Ambassador to Japan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within days to urge progress in resolving the outstanding issues on the Manchukuo-Soviet border. The major diplomatic issues between Japan and the Soviet Union were originally two: the North Pacific fishing concession issue and the Manchukuo-Soviet border issue. The fishing treaty was signed not long ago, resolving one of the issues. Now, this border issue will be reopened for negotiations under Japan's urging. This shows that the tense Japan-Soviet relations of the past few years will gradually ease in the future.

However, this change in Japan-Soviet relations should not be viewed simply as a matter between Japan and the Soviet Union. It should be seen as a phenomenon in the entire Far Eastern situation. What significance does this change reflect in the development of the entire Far Eastern situation? We believe that three meanings can be found. First, Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union has changed from eagerly provoking disputes to temporarily seeking compromise. Second, Japan is changing its Soviet foreign policy because of its current isolated diplomatic position. Third, in order to salvage the difficulty of its diplomatic isolation, Japan will not only "adjust" its relations with the Soviet Union, but also try to woo its relations with Britain and the United States to maintain the fruits of aggression it has gained in China.

We remember that after the signing of the Japan-Germany alliance a few months ago, the Soviet Union immediately protested to Tokyo and delayed the signing of the Japan-Soviet fishing agreement. At that time, Tokyo showed great anxiety, and Foreign Minister Arita was criticized by all parties and appeared very embarrassed. It was not until Litvinov indicated that the fishing agreement could be signed that the Japanese side turned sorrow into joy. Even the border issue, which was originally raised by the Soviet Union and repeatedly obstructed by Japan, is now being reopened for negotiations under the urging of Foreign Minister Arita. This situation shows that Japan's conciliatory attitude towards the Soviet Union is very noteworthy.

Japan's diplomatic isolation has become most evident in the past year. This is due to Japan's intensified advancement into North China and Inner Mongolia, which has caused common anxiety and dissatisfaction among Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. The puppet show in eastern Hebei has aroused global ridicule, and the evil wind of armed smuggling has been criticized by various countries. Recently, the puppet bandit army, under coercion, attacked Suiyuan, and no one sympathized with them. There is now clearly some diplomatic understanding between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly oppose aggressors who undermine peace in the Far East. This can be proved by the speeches of diplomatic figures from various countries. This reversal of the diplomatic situation is, of course, detectable by the Tokyo authorities. Therefore, those who originally insisted on a monolithic, tough policy now have to change their approach and conduct multifaceted wooing and compromise.

However, China must also pay close attention to the changes in this Far Eastern situation with great vigilance. In the past year, China has been able to adopt somewhat effective resistance to the pressure of aggressors. In addition to the exertion of our own strength, the corresponding activities in international diplomacy have, of course, played a role. We must not now allow the aggressors to regain this diplomatic advantage. While others are beginning diplomatic efforts, we should also intensify our diplomatic efforts. Do not forget the major changes in the diplomatic situation because of minor internal political issues.

### Surge in Japanese Imports Leads to Exchange Controls

Ministry of Finance Implements Emergency Measures; to be Abolished by the End of July This Year

[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Finance, in order to strengthen the Foreign Exchange Control Law promulgated in August 1933, today announced a ministerial ordinance to be implemented immediately, thoroughly managing foreign exchange for import payments and other purposes. Although there has been dissatisfied reaction from various quarters in the country, the authorities have resolutely implemented it for the following reasons: First, the yen exchange rate plummeted at the end of the year, and has not rebounded since the new year. If it is not curbed, there is a tendency to become unstable. Second, due to the increase in import tariffs in the future and the huge military expenditure in the next fiscal year, it far exceeds the amount that domestic military industry production capacity can absorb, and it is bound to increase the import of foreign goods, especially the amount of military supplies is huge. Third, due to the shortage of foreign exchange funds, the Japanese government is forced to approve the priority import of military supplies, and tighten restrictions on the import of daily necessities. Although the new order of the Ministry of Finance stipulates that it will be abolished on July 31 this year, it is still doubtful whether it will be extended again when the time comes. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th)

[Tokyo] The Japanese Minister of Finance recently issued a statement saying that the recent trend of increasing imports is quite significant. As a result, foreign exchange banks' purchases of import bills have also increased sharply. If this continues, it may have an adverse impact on the future of Japanese exchange rates. Therefore, at present, the bills for paying for imported goods must be approved by the government as a temporary emergency measure. Moreover, from the main purpose of preventing the overseas dumping of Japanese currency, the Ministry of Finance has designated a ministerial ordinance based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law to seek the stability of Japanese exchange rates and maintain the current exchange rate level. However, in the actual operation, a cautious attitude will be adopted to ensure that it does not affect industry and trade. In addition, this ministerial ordinance is a temporary emergency measure, so it is planned to broadly stop it on July 31 this year. (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 8th)

The Japanese Embassy in China today announced that the purpose of the Ministry of Finance ordinance based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law this time is to adjust in response to rising prices and the expected sharp increase in imports due to tariff revisions. It is only a temporary emergency measure and will be abolished at the end of July this year. This measure will be used to seek the stability of Japanese exchange rates and maintain the current exchange rate level. However, when this ordinance is implemented, full attention will naturally be paid to ensure that it does not cause any obstacles to Japanese commerce and trade. This ordinance will be implemented from January 8 this year. According to this ordinance, all foreign exchange transactions and the acquisition of letters of credit for the payment of goods shipped to Japan must, in principle, be approved. This ordinance has already been published in the official gazette on January 8. However, the following two or three matters that should be noted in this regard are listed as examples:

㊀ The term "foreign exchange transaction" in this ordinance includes the sale of Japanese currency abroad and the implementation of foreign exchange reservations agreed upon before the implementation of this ordinance. However, transactions of less than 30,000 yuan equivalent per month do not require permission.

㊁ Based on the letter of credit obtained before the implementation of this ordinance, permission is also required when opening a bill of exchange for the payment of goods exported from Shanghai.

㊂ Permission is also required when the value of goods exported from Japan without foreign exchange is used to offset the value of goods imported into Japan (Allied News Agency)

### Japanese Ministry of Finance Ordinance

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance Deng Biao stated that in order to cope with the current situation of Japanese exchange rates, the government has decided to announce on January 8 the Ministry of Finance ordinance based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law and implement it immediately. The content is as follows:

㊀ In principle, foreign exchange transactions and the receipt of letters of credit for the settlement of import prices must be approved by the government.

㊁ The foreign exchange transactions subject to the above provisions include the purchase of foreign exchange, the sale of Japanese currency abroad, remittances to foreign countries, entrustment of payments, and foreign exchange reservations predetermined before the implementation of this ordinance.

㊂ In the following cases, it is not necessary to obtain government approval for foreign exchange transactions and the receipt of letters of credit:

(A) The number of transactions is less than 30,000 yuan per month.

(B) Foreign exchange transactions are carried out based on letters of credit obtained with or without government approval.

(C) When settling two-month bills of exchange for goods that have been completely imported at the time of the implementation of this ordinance or for goods shipped from foreign countries.

(D) In order to settle bills of exchange for goods shipped from foreign countries within one week after the implementation of this ordinance, the foreign exchange predetermined before the implementation of this ordinance is carried out.

㊃ When using the funds from goods exported without foreign exchange as payment for imported goods, government approval must be obtained.

㊄ Importers, in order to carry out the necessary settlement for imports, should obtain government approval to handle foreign currency securities, foreign currency deposits, foreign currency loans, etc. abroad, or to borrow money abroad using these foreign currency funds as collateral.

㊅ Foreign exchange banks must confirm whether their customers' foreign exchange transactions and the receipt of letters of credit are legal.

㊅ When a foreign exchange bank pays a bank designated overseas, the remittance check or remittance bill and the designated payment document must be approved, unless the amount is less than 10,000 yuan.

㊇ Those who have imported goods worth more than 500,000 yuan in Showa 11 must submit a report on the actual performance of imported goods settlement in Showa 10 and Showa 11.

㊈ Those who have obtained permission for the necessary transactions to settle imported goods should submit a monthly import report when importing the goods (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 8th)

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance issued the following notes on the implementation of Ministry of Finance Ordinance No. 1 of the Exchange Control Department:

㊀ When applying for permission for various transactions necessary for the settlement of imported goods, it should be done before ordering or signing the contract, unless there are unavoidable circumstances in the business. For imported goods for which the sales negotiations have been concluded at the time of the implementation of this ordinance, permission should be obtained as soon as possible after the implementation of this ordinance.

㊁ Foreign exchange banks, in order to confirm whether their customers' foreign exchange transactions and letters of credit are legal, should obtain a permission certificate from those who transact with foreign exchange banks to indicate that they are legal.

㊂ Regarding the items to be recorded in the application for permission, the provisions of Ministry of Finance Ordinance No. 8 of Showa 8 shall be applied mutatis mutandis. However, the transaction relationship of the import of goods, etc. must be recorded in detail. Therefore, when applying for permission, the headquarters or the Bank of Japan should be consulted first to receive instructions.

㊃ Those who have questions about this ordinance may go to the headquarters or the Bank of Japan to inquire about the details, and it is hoped that the general public will pay attention to avoid violating the law (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 8th)

### Tokyo Exchange Market Chaos

[Tokyo] The exchange market was very chaotic on the 8th due to the implementation of the Ministry of Finance ordinance on exchange controls. Import and export businesses find it difficult to predict the future, and transactions are congested. According to this morning's telegram, although the US-UK exchange rate has not changed, it is still $4.91 and 7/32. However, the US-Japan exchange rate has fallen by 5 cents to $0.28 and 46 cents, which is proof of the foreign market's criticism of this provincial meeting. The market quotations generally remain the same as the previous day. The selling price for US current month is $28.08 and 3/8, and the buying price opens at 16 and 7/8. The selling price for the next month is $28.16 and 5/8, and the buying price is the same at 8 and 3/8. However, a special seller recently appeared at $28.16 and 7/8, which is quite strong. The selling price for UK current month is 1 shilling 1 pence and 7/8, and the buying price is the same at 16 and 15. The selling price for the next month is 1 shilling 1 pence and 27/32, and the buying price is the same at 8 and 7/8, which is no different from the previous day. Also, the Yokohama Specie Bank's listing is unchanged for both US and UK currencies. (8th, Allied Press)

### US Next Year's Budget Submitted to Congress

Military Spending Unprecedentedly Huge, Reconstruction and Relief Funds Also Enormous

[Washington] Today, President Roosevelt submitted the fiscal year budget ending June 30, 1938, to Congress, requesting an unprecedented amount of peacetime national defense spending in 1938. The construction costs of two new battleships are also included. The key points of this new budget are listed below:

㊀ Revenue and expenditure of the 1938 budget.

㊁ It is recommended to continue levying nuisance taxes at the current rate, maintain the 3-cent postage rate, and establish a Civilian Conservation Corps on a permanent basis.

㊂ The revenue for 1936 is announced as US$4,115,957,000, and the expenditure is US$8,879,798,000.

㊃ The estimated revenue for 1937 is approximately US$5,828,151,000, and the expenditure is approximately US$8,480,804,000.

㊄ The estimated revenue for 1938 is approximately US$7,293,607,000, and the expenditure (excluding work relief funds) is approximately US$6,158,000,000, with a surplus of US$1,135,608,000.

㊅ In addition to the regular budget of the Navy Department for 1938, an additional US$23,300,000 will be allocated to begin the construction of two battleships with a displacement of 35,000 tons.

㊆ Regulations are stipulated to enable the Navy to realize its original construction program, so that the fleet strength can be expanded to its full extent by 1942.

㊇ When allocating funds to the Naval Aviation Bureau, the manufacturing costs of 400 new aircraft should be included.

㊈ It is recommended that the expenditure of the Army's expenses should be increased by US$16,000,000 compared to the 1937 budget.

㊉ The minimum number of new aircraft required by the Army in 1938 should be 530.

President Roosevelt continued that the 1938 budget is balanced in revenue and expenditure. In addition to reducing debt by US$401,515,000, an additional US$1,537,123,000 will be allocated for reconstruction and relief. If the progress of the economic situation can continue to be maintained at the current rate, we can expect to obtain a fully balanced budget in 1939, and have sufficient funds to meet the statutory needs and debt reduction. President Roosevelt advocated continuing to implement the so-called nuisance tax at the current rate, maintaining the US$0.03 stamp rate, and establishing a Civilian Conservation Corps on a permanent basis.

President Roosevelt informed Congress that the total revenue for the 1936 fiscal year was US$4,115,957,000 and the total expenditure was US$8,879,798,000. The shortfall was due to the Supreme Court's recognition of the business tax as illegal and the increase in the endowment to veterans due to Congress' insistence.

The estimated revenue for the 1937 fiscal year is US$5,828,151,000 and the estimated expenditure is US$8,480,804,000, including US$790,000,000, which will soon be requested from Congress to continue the work relief program from February 1 to June 30. At the end of the current fiscal year, the gross public debt will be approximately US$35,026,000,000, an increase of US$1,248,000,000 compared to 1936.

President Roosevelt did not request to revise the tax rate for unpaid bonuses in the 1928 fiscal year, saying that it must be possible to achieve this goal based on the phenomenon.

The estimated expenditure for the 1938 budget, excluding work relief funds, is US$6,158,000,000. National defense spending increased by US$27,000,000, reaching an unprecedented peacetime figure of US$991,600,000. The estimated revenue is US$7,293,607,000, which is more than the previous year, mostly due to the improvement of commerce, the abundant harvest of income tax, and the implementation of the 1936 tax law. There are no regulations for work relief funds, but including the necessary funds for debt repayment, there is still a surplus of US$1,135,608,000.

The various programs that have been implemented in the past four years will require huge amounts of money, but the benefits obtained are far greater than the costs.

Since 1933, the commercial situation has shown significant progress every year compared to the previous year.

The total amount of peacetime national defense spending requested by President Roosevelt for 1938 is unprecedentedly huge, including the construction costs of two new battleships. Therefore, the shipbuilding action will be consistent with the United Kingdom. Both ships are 35,000 tons, and the cost of each ship is approximately US$50 million. For the purpose of starting shipbuilding, President Roosevelt has increased the originally planned budget of the Navy Department for 1938 from US$563,996,000 to US$587,302,000. The goal of the Navy's shipbuilding program is to expand the strength of the fleet to its full extent and to complete it in 1942. In addition to the regulations implemented in stages, President Roosevelt intends to allocate US$49,500,000 to the Naval Aviation Bureau, of which US$28,000,000 will be used to increase the number of new aircraft by 400. According to the funds approved in 1927, this amount is US$27,000,000.

President Roosevelt requested that US$393,460,000 be used for various Army items, which is approximately US$16,000,000 more than the 1937 budget, of which US$37,435,000 is for the purchase of new aircraft, which is approximately US$4,000,000 more than the 1937 figure. According to the Army's plan, at least 530 new aircraft must be added in 1938, which is the same as the number specified in the 1937 budget. (8th, Reuters)

### German Social Democratic Party's Anniversary in Power

Hitler to Elaborate on Political Achievements

[Berlin] January 30th is the fourth anniversary of the German leader Hitler's assumption of power entrusted by the late President von Hindenburg. Hitler has scheduled a meeting of the House of Representatives on that day. The political circles believe that this meeting will only discuss domestic affairs. At that time, Hitler will issue a declaration, describing his work in the past four years, and may apply for continued possession of full power for some time. According to a solemn statement from the authorities, there will be no changes to Germany's constitution and cabinet organization. Rumors from outside that Hitler intends to resign from the post of Prime Minister and only retain his position as leader have been denied by the semi-official side.

[Berlin] A Paris newspaper carried news that the German leader Hitler is now seeking to add a title equal to that of Emperor as soon as possible. Berlin today made a semi-official denial of this, using strong language, saying that the newspapers are competing to publish this kind of unconscious rumors, completely disregarding their own political credibility.

### Italy Still Intends to Cooperate with the League of Nations

Executive Yuan Convenes on the 18th of This Month

[Geneva] It is generally believed that when the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations holds its regular meeting on the 18th of this month, the British representative will submit a report on the details of the gentleman's agreement between the United Kingdom and Italy. At that time, Italy will also send representatives to attend. Since the League of Nations General Assembly implemented sanctions in November 1934, this will be the first time that Italian representatives have re-attended the Executive Yuan meeting. League of Nations officials recently announced that the League of Nations General Assembly will hold a temporary meeting at the end of this month to accept Egypt as a member state. At the same time, due to the fact that Italian troops in Abyssinia have occupied the Ghor region, the last remaining independent government of Abyssinia has been eliminated. Therefore, it will refuse to allow the Abyssinian delegation to attend. If Ghor is the case, cooperation between Italy and the League of Nations will no longer be hindered. (7th, Havas)

Vatican The Holy See issued a bulletin today on the Pope's condition, which is the most encouraging of the week. It is said that the Pope's health is gradually improving and he is now able to get out of bed and sit in a wheelchair, which is of great benefit to the patient. The Pope has therefore been able to lie on his back with his legs raised. A special cover has now been prepared and placed inside the quilt to prevent the affected leg from being chafed. It is heard that although the Pope feels mentally exhausted for the time being, his thoughts are still very active. (7th, Reuters)

### The Battle for Madrid Enters the Final Critical Moment

German and Moroccan Troops Assist in the Fierce Offensive, Key Towns in the Northwest Suburbs of the Capital are Occupied

Madrid The Madrid Defense Committee issued a bulletin today, stating that the battle between the government forces and the national army for the city has entered a critical moment. Fierce battles took place in the areas of Pozuelo, de Alarcón, El Plantío, and Las Rozas yesterday, day and night. German and Moroccan troops, under the cover of a large number of tanks, launched a fierce attack on the government forces' front line. The government forces guarded the trenches and fought back with all their might, causing heavy casualties to the national army, especially near Las Rozas. At the same time, the various newspapers belonging to the government have begun to urge the citizens of Madrid to leave the country quickly. Major Carlos, the political commissar of the Fifth Battalion, today advocated that the government forces be unified under one command, so that military power can be unified to cope with the overall situation. He solemnly stated that women and children and all people who cannot directly or indirectly participate in the war should leave the country as soon as possible to avoid being detrimental to the war. (7th, Reuters)

Ávila Our correspondent, Tao Sibida, reports that the government forces in the city of Madrid launched a fierce attack on the area of the Gasategamba Park in the western suburbs before dawn yesterday. The two sides fought hand-to-hand with bayonets for an hour. When the east began to whiten, the government forces finally could not withstand it and retreated. Until 9:00 a.m., the national army also began to attack from the battle area in the early morning, first using artillery to bombard the government forces' positions, and then using infantry to charge. Although the government forces fought bravely, the national army still won victory after victory. By noon, all targets had been captured. For example, the villages of Pozuelo, Xumera, Cruz Garlo, Valde Gómez, and Bertigona in the northwestern suburbs have all fallen into the hands of the national army one after another. A staff officer of the national army recently made a statement to our correspondent, "Our army has won a great victory in the northwestern suburbs of Madrid. Although this battle was extremely fierce, the victory of this battle was truly unexpected." (8th, Havas)

[Paris] "Le Journal" recently published a report from Berlin, stating that the German authorities have now decided to actively assist the Spanish National Army together with Italy, so as to achieve victory within two months. In recent days, a large number of military supplies have been transported to Spain, and special teams from the garrisons in Rubin, Leonburg, and Elzengot have also gone to assist the National Army in the battle. Troops have also been sent from Munich. German sources here say that those who went to Spain are only volunteers, not formal troops. (7th, Havas)

### Britain and France Suggest Germany and Italy Submit Replies

Approve the Principle of Stopping the Sending of Volunteer Soldiers, Attaching Three Conditions with the Intention of Delaying

[Berlin] The German government submitted a reply to the British and French ambassadors in Berlin last night regarding the proposal of Britain and France on December 23 on non-interference in the Spanish civil war. The reply contains three conditions for cooperation in continuing non-interference in the Spanish civil war, namely: ㊀ All other nine countries involved should take the same attitude towards non-interference; ㊁ The issue of indirect non-interference should also be dealt with immediately; ㊂ The governments of all participating countries should agree to unconditional and effective supervision of the agreed-upon ban, and this supervision should be implemented on the spot. The reply also advocated that non-Spanish participants in the Spanish war, including political activists and propagandists, should all be ordered to leave the country. The reply expressed surprise that the British and French governments directly appealed to the governments participating in the committee while the Non-Intervention Committee was meeting to discuss the prohibition of volunteer soldiers going to Spain, saying that if they believed that the procedures of the committee were not appropriate, they should stop these procedures. It also said that the Italian and German governments had requested from the beginning to prohibit foreign volunteer soldiers from participating in the Spanish civil war, but the British and French governments did not agree at that time. The reply also stated that this ban must prevent its results from becoming a unilateral support for anti-French elements, and only benefit the Spanish Bolshevik Party, because the strength of the party has been greatly consolidated by obtaining the assistance of foreign volunteer teams. However, Germany is very willing to support all plans to prevent the continuous flow of volunteer teams into Spain, in order to completely eliminate the possibility of direct and indirect interference in the Spanish civil war. At this point in the reply, the above three conditions were listed, followed by the statement that if no method can be agreed upon to curb other forms of indirect interference, the German government will reserve the right to re-study its attitude towards the volunteer team issue. According to a message from the German News Agency, the German government's reply was drafted after consultation with the Italian government, so the Italian government's reply will be the same in substance as the German reply. (8th, Reuters)

[Rome] Regarding the proposal by the United Kingdom and France to prohibit volunteer soldiers from going to Spain to serve, the Italian government's reply has just been published, stating that Italy accepts the proposal to prohibit volunteer soldiers from going to Spain in principle, but with the following conditions: ㊀ The countries concerned should adopt the same attitude; ㊁ Effective supervision should be implemented at the Spanish border entry points; ㊂ The Italian government firmly believes that the methods currently adopted by the London Adjustment Committee are ineffective and should be abandoned, because the issue of non-interference in the Spanish civil war should be discussed as a whole for both direct and indirect interference. The Italian government made this proposal in the early stages. Therefore, the Italian government expects that other issues regarding interference in the Spanish civil war, such as raising funds to support both parties involved in the civil war, will be resolved in the same way as the issue of prohibiting volunteer soldiers. (7th, Havas)

### German Claim

Claiming to Be Extremely Just

[Berlin] Regarding Germany's reply to the proposal of the United Kingdom and France to prohibit volunteer soldiers from going to Spain, political figures recently expressed their views, saying that Germany's reply is consistent with the attitude adopted by Germany and Italy from the beginning. An investigation shows that Germany and Italy have always opposed direct or indirect interference in the Spanish civil war in any way. In the future, if the efforts of Germany and Italy fail, the blame will not lie with the two countries. Political figures also said that the purpose of the recommendations in the German reply is to limit the scope of the Spanish war and prevent it from expanding to involve other countries. All countries should recognize that the claims of Germany and Italy are indeed just and should be supported. (7th, Havas)

### British and French Views

German Conditions are Difficult to Implement, but the Door to Negotiations is Not Closed

[London] Regarding the prohibition of volunteer soldiers from going to Spain, responsible parties recently expressed their views after receiving the replies from Germany and Italy, saying that the British and French governments, in view of the unusually tense international situation, took joint action to eliminate the problem before it took shape. Judging from the replies of Germany and Italy, it can be seen that this attempt by Britain and France has achieved initial success. Although the German reply believes that the current prohibition of volunteer soldiers from going to Spain is unfavorable to the National Army, it still accepts the proposal of Britain and France in principle. Therefore, the way to solve the volunteer soldier problem is not closed because of this. It is estimated that the British government will renegotiate with the governments of the countries concerned in the shortest possible time in order to take concrete measures to promote the implementation of the proposals of Britain and France. (7th, Havas)

[Paris] Regarding the prohibition of volunteer soldiers from going to Spain, responsible persons here need to comment on the German reply, saying that the German reply has not completely denied the proposals made by Britain and France. Therefore, negotiations on the issue of prohibiting volunteer soldiers can still continue, and the international tension has also been eased because of this. As for a certain condition mentioned in the German reply, responsible persons all believe that it is difficult to implement. (7th, Havas)

### Germany's Ultimatum Expires, Spanish Government Still Has No Reply

Germany Freely Disposes of Seized Spanish Ships, Believing This Incident Has Ended

[Berlin] The deadline for Germany's ultimatum to Spain has expired, but the Valencia government's ultimatum, although at 8:00 a.m. this morning regarding whether to release a portion of the cargo and one passenger on the detained German ship "Palos", has remained silent to this day. In view of the Spanish government's lack of reply, Germany believes that it has no sincerity in considering Germany's request. Therefore, it is prepared to detain the two intercepted Spanish ships. The significance of Germany's move is probably to hand over the two ships to the Spanish National Army government as compensation for the cargo detained on the "Palos" and to console the families of the detained Spanish passengers. It is heard that after the above measures are implemented, Germany will consider this accident to have ended. If Spain no longer violates German ships, Germany will no longer take retaliatory action.

Turkey Denies Troop Concentration on Syrian Border; France Favors Diplomatic Solution

[Ankara] Today, responsible authorities here denied rumors that Turkish troops were concentrating on the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish President Kemal Atatürk suddenly went to Konya in southern Anatolia, near the French Syrian border, on the 6th of this month and is expected to return to the capital in two or three days. He met with key local officials there to discuss the overall situation. (Reuters, 8th)

[Geneva] Regarding the issue of Alexandretta and Antioch, currently under negotiation between France and Turkey, League of Nations circles believe that the League's Administrative Council will hold a meeting soon. Before the Administrative Council discusses the issue, Turkey will not actually withdraw from the League of Nations, nor will it take drastic political or military decisions. However, if the outcome of the Administrative Council's discussion is not satisfactory to Turkey, the country may change its attitude. Turkish sources say that President Kemal Atatürk has now decided not to allow the Turks in Alexandretta and Antioch to be governed jointly with the Arab Syrians. Therefore, the Turkish delegation will propose the establishment of a federal state when the League of Nations Administrative Council meets, comprising three autonomous states: (1) the Autonomous State of Syria, (2) the Autonomous State of Lebanon, and (3) the Autonomous State of Alexandretta and Antioch, all jointly guaranteed by France and Turkey. However, the autonomous state formed by Alexandretta and Antioch should become a demilitarized zone. (Havas, 7th)

[Ankara] Government spokesman Falih Rifki recently published an article in the press commenting on the issue of Alexandretta and Antioch, stating, "This issue was initially a legal issue, but it has now become a matter of the sacred responsibility of the Turkish Republic and the Turkish nation. France can resolve this matter slowly, but Turkey cannot wait any longer." The current ambiguous status of Alexandretta and Antioch is something Turkey cannot allow to remain unchanged indefinitely. In short, the residents of both cities should have the right to self-determination; this is the crux of the matter. (Havas, 7th)

[Paris] Deputy Foreign Minister Vienot met with Turkish Ambassador Suad at 6 p.m. to discuss the issue of Turkish minorities in Alexandretta and Antioch for two hours. According to responsible sources, the recent articles published in Turkish newspapers have been quite aggressive. Vienot explained to the Turkish ambassador that this could affect the possibility of France and Turkey reaching an agreement on the issue of Alexandretta and Antioch. He also stated that the French government is currently carefully studying the issue and hopes that the Turkish government will also consider it carefully. If Turkey agrees to postpone the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting (originally scheduled for the 18th of this month) so that French-Turkish negotiations can continue, the French government can request that the Administrative Council postpone the meeting. (Havas, 7th)

[Paris] A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that France currently has a total of 30,000 troops stationed in its white colony in Syria, which is sufficient to deal with any eventuality, but hopes that there will be no trouble. (Guomin News Agency, 7th)

### Fujian Province's Economic Construction Plan for This Year

Chen Yi Publishes Speech on Grain Self-Sufficiency Plan

Fuzhou Communication: Fujian Province is located in the subtropics. Except for a small portion of the plains along the coast, almost the entire province is mountainous. Of the province's total area of more than 170 million mu, only more than 20 million mu are available for agricultural cultivation, less than 12 percent. The annual production is 30 to 40 million dan of grain, 30 to 40 million dan of sweet potatoes, and more than 3 million dan of wheat, which together are only enough to feed the entire province for eight or nine months. As for clothing materials, there is no cotton or wool. Food and clothing must rely on others. Fortunately, there are many mountains that can be afforested for planting fruit trees, tea, and bamboo. Bamboo can produce bamboo shoots and can also be used for papermaking. Therefore, the province can produce tea worth more than 10 million yuan, timber worth 7 to 8 million yuan, and local paper worth 6 to 7 million yuan annually, as well as bamboo shoots and fruits worth several million yuan. These products, plus some sporadic local products, are exported to other provinces or foreign countries annually, worth a total of 30 to 40 million yuan. However, the province needs to import goods from outside, which are twice as much as the province's exports, about 70 to 80 million yuan, half of which is food and clothing. Therefore, the province has a huge trade deficit every year. Although overseas remittances are about 40 million yuan per year, because in the past there was no way to use them in the province, in addition to balancing the province's foreign exchange receipts and payments, it can be said that it has little benefit to the province's economic situation. The provincial government has now designated this year as the province's economic construction year. The purpose is: (1) To supply the people's daily necessities as much as possible by utilizing the province's material production and reduce the import of luxury goods. (2) To improve and develop the province's special products and products with abundant output in order to increase exports. Regarding the first item, the province should first seek to be self-sufficient in grain. Regarding the second item, the province should first select the most important special products to promote the sales channels in the external markets to increase the purchasing power of the Fujian people abroad in exchange for other necessary goods. The speech on the grain self-sufficiency plan in the economic construction year published by Provincial Chairman Chen Yi is transcribed as follows: (1) Reclamation of wasteland: If Fujian Province wants to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, the most urgent task is to reclaim wasteland. If the reclamation of wasteland increases the cultivated land by one-tenth, then one or two months of grain can be produced each year, and the problem of insufficient grain in the province can be partially solved. However, the method of reclamation is not simple. How to gather farmers, organize land, raise capital, and apply technology all need to be studied. Generally, the method of land reclamation can be divided into three types: one is publicly owned and publicly operated, the second is publicly owned and community-operated, and the third is publicly owned and privately operated or privately owned and privately operated. Which of these three methods is appropriate needs to be tested by facts. The province plans to first designate two areas to test the two methods of publicly owned and publicly operated and publicly owned and community-operated. After the operation is successful, it will be promoted to various places. (2) Improving agricultural technology (such as seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, agricultural tools, agricultural product manufacturing, livestock improvement, etc.): The province is currently preparing three tasks for the improvement of agricultural technology: one is research. The province has established several farms and several agricultural schools to engage in this work. However, this kind of work requires a long time. In order to concentrate talents and resources, the province plans to set up a complete experimental farm this year as the center for the province's research on agricultural technology. If financial resources permit, this will be used as the basis to expand into an agricultural university. The second is promotion. If the improved agricultural technology cannot be commonly accepted and utilized by farmers, it will not help the improvement of agriculture. Therefore, promoting new technologies is as important as research. Last year, the province established a farmer teacher training class, the purpose of which is to train teachers who educate farmers to impart new technologies to farmers. The province will take the farmer teacher training school as the center for promoting new agricultural technologies. Starting from the second half of this year, it is planned to have 20 counties set up farmer vocational supplementary schools. Each school will have a large farm. The students will be recruited from local young farmers and will graduate in one year. They will attend classes on the one hand and cultivate on the other hand. The income from cultivation will belong to them. In the future, this kind of supplementary school will be gradually promoted throughout the province. If the province has 62 schools, each school graduates 100 people per year, then there will be 6,200 people per year, and more than 30,000 new farmers in five years. After training so many new farmers, it is necessary to set up factories for manufacturing agricultural tools and fertilizers to produce the things needed for new agriculture to supply the farmers' use, and the agricultural revolution within agriculture can start from this. The third is application. We want to guide farmers to organize various cooperatives to apply various new technologies, that is, to take farmers' cooperatives as the center for applying new technologies. In addition, there are two things we should especially advocate: (1) Pay attention to irrigation and improve farmland water conservancy, such as building gates, dredging rivers, digging ditches, building dikes, etc., to protect farmland and prevent water and drought disasters. We should universally advocate that farmers do it. (2) Promote animal husbandry. Animal husbandry is a rural sideline, and attention should be paid to improvement. The provincial government has now started to improve chickens, ducks, pigs, sheep, etc. As for cattle, horses, and donkeys, they are not only agricultural and transportation tools in peacetime, but also very important for national defense. However, the breeds of horses and donkeys in the province are not good. How to improve them should be studied. As for agricultural education, it is certainly a necessary tool for improving agricultural technology. The province's agricultural education is planned to be divided into two types: (1) Farmer education, the purpose of which is to train farmers who can apply new agricultural technologies. (2) Agricultural professional education, the purpose of which is to train high-level agricultural technical talents. For example, primary agricultural vocational schools, whose students are too young and have low scientific knowledge, cannot be a farmer or a technician after graduation. These schools are planned to be closed down in the future. (3) Managing grain: The grain problem is a production problem on the one hand and a distribution problem on the other hand. The amount of rice consumed in the province each year is about 35 million dan, of which more than 28 million dan are produced in the province, and the rest is imported from outside. This insufficient amount can be solved if the above-mentioned wasteland reclamation and agricultural technology improvement are effective. However, it is still necessary to have proper distribution, so that the contradiction between low grain prices hurting farmers and rice shortages will not occur in the province at the same time. Therefore, grain management is a necessary work for regulating grain. In the future, in addition to finding ways to improve distribution methods to reduce distribution costs, we will ensure that all parts of the province can buy the same amount of rice at almost the same price throughout the year. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to implement price control, set a minimum price to protect producers, and set a maximum price to protect consumers. In addition, the government should also set up warehouses for unlimited purchase or sale to regulate the relationship between supply and demand. (January 6)

### Xiamen Cancels Overseas Emigration Water Police Subsidy Fee

Provincial Government Telegram Orders Cancellation from New Year's Day This Year; Overseas Chinese Are Very Pleased to Be Exempted from Harsh Taxes

Xiamen Communication: The Second Brigade Headquarters of the Fujian Water Police stationed in Xiamen, after consulting with the local inn industry last summer, collected a water police subsidy fee of 50 cents per person from overseas Chinese when selling ship tickets at the inn, on the grounds of building electric boats to consolidate coastal defense and remitted to the Second Brigade Headquarters of the Water Police. The collection started in September last autumn. It was originally scheduled to be temporarily collected for six months. In December last year, in order to unify the province's tax revenue, the provincial government ordered the subsidy fee to be transferred to the Xiamen Municipal Government Finance Bureau for direct collection, which was designated as a local tax. The inn industry was unwilling to collect the fee on behalf of the government, and presented a request to the Finance Bureau to transfer the matter to the provincial government for cancellation on the grounds that it could not allow overseas Chinese to bear this fee for a long time. The Finance Bureau then sent police to board ships to collect the fee directly from overseas Chinese, which was quite harsh. However, on January 5 of this year, the Xiamen Municipal Government received a telegram order from the provincial government, which stated, "The water police subsidy fee for Nanyang ship tickets is approved to be cancelled from January 1, 1937." After receiving the order, the Municipal Government immediately ordered the Finance Bureau to handle the matter accordingly and issue a notice by the Municipal Government to inform the public. Most of the overseas Chinese from southern Fujian are laborers. Because there is no work to be done in China, they pawn their belongings to pay for travel expenses and go abroad to make a living. The fees for ship tickets, passports, and vaccinations are already a heavy burden. They have long complained about this additional illegal subsidy fee, but no one has appealed for them, and they cannot obtain the qualifications of overseas Chinese before their departure, so they have to pay with resentment. Now that they have been exempted from the fee, they all feel relieved. (January 6)

### Verdict on Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang's Case of Endangering the Republic of China (Continued)

Sentenced to Seven Years of Imprisonment and Deprived of Public Rights for Seven Years

(B) Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi were charged with colluding with traitors to plot to disrupt public order and attempted murder for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. The crime under Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Endangering the Republic of China has three constituent elements: (1) There must be the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. (2) There must be an act of colluding with traitors. (3) There must be a plot to disrupt public order. The element of plotting to disrupt public order requires a concrete plan for how to disrupt local public order. According to the facts alleged by the prosecutor, "The defendants Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang were instructed by Wang Yaqiao, Hua Kezhi, and others, who are at large, to come to Beijing to organize the Chenguang News Agency as a cover for assassinating key central figures. They also recruited Liu Shurong to come to Beijing to help with news interviews and participate in confidential matters. In October 1934, they began to issue manuscripts. At that time, Hua Kezhi received a six-round revolver from Wang Yaqiao and hid it at Zhang Biquan's house. In December of the same year, the Central Government held the Wang Zhongquan Meeting. Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang sent Sun Fengming to the Central Party Headquarters to attempt to assassinate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but the attempt failed. Later, they hid the gun at Lu Qingqi's house and then took it back. In August 1935, President Wang Jingwei resigned. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew to Beijing from Wuhan. He Puguang accompanied Sun Fengming to the airport to carry out the assassination, but it failed because they did not meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Later, the agency's funds ran out. Hua and Zhang recruited Xiang Zhonglin to come to Beijing to engage in activities to subsidize the agency. Xiang's old friend Li Huaicheng often came to chat and also heard the secrets. On November 1 of the same year, the Central Government held the Sixth Plenary Session. Several days before the meeting, around October 20 of the same year, Hua Kezhi brought Sun Fengming to Beijing to discuss with Zhang He and others and decided to take action when taking photos after the opening of the Sixth Plenary Session. Because the previous two failures were due to focusing on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek alone, they decided to first target Chiang, then Wang. If both failed, they would create a big disturbance (according to Zhang Yuhua, that is, indiscriminate firing in the venue). Fearing that Sun Fengming, who was in charge of the implementation, would have unstable will and temporary negligence, Hua Kezhi initiated a talk on the evening of the 28th of the same month. Hua Zhang He Liu Xiang Li and Sun were all present. Except for Liu, who did not speak, the others gave Sun guidance or encouragement. Sun promised to stay and not return for the time being. Xiang and He found a way to obtain a reporter's entry and exit permit and handed it to Sun Fengming for admission, which led to the incident on November 1 of last year. This court found that the defendants Zhang Yuhua and others listened to Wang Yaqiao, Hua Kezhi, and others to come to Beijing to organize the Chenguang News Agency as a cover for assassinating key central figures, how they allocated work, how they hid weapons, how they obtained entry and exit permits, how they encouraged implementation, and how they accompanied the assassin to enter the venue to assassinate. The details of the circumstances have been repeatedly stated by the defendants in the police headquarters and in the investigation of this court. Their criminal suspicion must not be said to be insignificant. Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, and others argued that because they had misunderstood the authorities' diplomatic policy and were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, they had planned to assassinate key figures and had no intention of endangering the Republic of China or colluding with traitors. Whether their confessions are credible is not known. However, the defendants had all fled Beijing before the incident occurred, leaving only the murderer Sun Fengming alone, carrying a six-round revolver with five bullets into the venue. Whether it was intentional or unintentional firing, it was not enough to cause a sudden disruption of local public order. Even if Zhang Yuhua had said "If the assassination fails, create a big disturbance" when talking with Hua He Sun in the Chenguang News Agency several days before the incident, it was only an expression of Zhang Yuhua's personal intention. The people present at the time did not have any plans or resolutions on how to prepare for the implementation of the disturbance (see pages 106, 108, and 111 of the Police Headquarters Investigation File and page 30 of the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Investigation File), so it is difficult to say that there was any situation of plotting to disrupt public order. If the defendants conspired in advance or participated in part of the work in Sun Fengming's assassination of key central figures, in addition to complying with the provisions of Article 270-1, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, it does not meet the requirements of the aforementioned crime of endangering the Republic of China. The first instance of the crime in Article 271 of the Criminal Law is under the jurisdiction of the local government, and this court is not convenient to make a substantive judgment. According to the provisions of Article 246 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a judgment of jurisdictional error is made, and a transfer to the Capital District Court with jurisdiction is made at the same time.

Based on the above conclusions, according to Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 6 and Article 10 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Endangering the Republic of China, Article 28, Article 37, Paragraph 2, Article 38, Paragraph 3, Section 1, Section 2, Article 40 of the Criminal Law, and Article 296 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is made as in the main text.

This case was executed by Luo Renji, the prosecutor of this court, performing the duties of the prosecutor. December 31, 1936, Republic of China.

Wu Yuheng, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Court of the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, Judge Xuan Kai, Judge Si Wen, the right certificate is the same as the original, Liu Suize, Clerk of the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, January 5, 1937, Republic of China.

If the parties are dissatisfied with this judgment, they should file an appeal to this court within ten days from the day after the judgment is served, with a written statement stating the reasons for dissatisfaction. (End)

### Director Wang Discusses Plans to Promote National Sports

Training Physical Education Teachers in Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou This Summer

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th) Regarding the Ministry of Education's recent plans to promote national sports, Director Wang issued the following statement on the 8th, briefly stating that the Ministry has always attached great importance to promoting national sports. The matters that are urgently planned for implementation include: ㊀ Enhancing extracurricular sports activities in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools. The method is to designate morning and after 3:00 PM as extracurricular sports time, and to prescribe sports activities, duration, based on the age, gender, physical strength differences of students at each level of school. Each person should have at least one and a half to two hours of extracurricular exercise per day, and all students should be required to participate in the exercise. ㊁ Training physical education teachers, which is the basic work for improving the level of physical education in schools. Furthermore, since the promotion of physical education should start from elementary schools, elementary school teachers should be able to teach physical education courses concurrently. Attention should be paid to the physical education training of normal school students while they are in school, in order to ensure that normal school students have good physical education training. Therefore, appropriate training should first be implemented for the physical education teachers of normal schools. The training period is planned to begin this summer, simultaneously in Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, for a period of approximately three months or more. ㊂ Issuing a general order to all provinces and cities to establish full-time physical education supervisors and physical education sections. In view of the fact that students at all levels of schools are often unable to participate in sports universally, and that some schools pay attention to the athlete system, neglecting the physical fitness of the majority of students, which is not the way to promote popular sports. A method for group competitions is being drafted, and a few schools will be designated for experimentation first, and the results will be promoted nationwide. The detailed provisions of the method are currently being drafted.

### Ding Mingyi's Skills Improve, Almost Surpassing Billiard King Medina

Losing by Only Fourteen Points Out of Three Hundred Points - A Wonderful Scene in the Sino-Portuguese League

Ding Mingyi, the main player of the Chinese Youth Association, performed well yesterday, almost overwhelming Medina, the leader of the Portuguese team. It was a wonderful scene in the fourth week of the Sino-Portuguese clash in the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Team League. The Chinese Youth Association lost to Portugal by only thirty-two points, due to the significant loss of the fifth player, Yi De, and the near victory but ultimate defeat of the third player, Zhu Qiliang. As for Mingyi's loss of fourteen points to Medina, it was considered an unexpected stroke of luck. However, when calculating the scores of each team, the Chinese Youth Association still scored more than Portugal. This small setback has little impact on the future of the league leaders.

After the fifth round, Ding Mingyi scored thirty-one points with one shot, twenty-one points with the next, and twenty-one points with the next, leading with seventy-three to forty-four. At that time, the goddess of luck repeatedly visited, and unexpected gains occurred one after another. The spectators were delighted, and Medina was stunned. The highest difference was Ding Mingyi at two hundred and twenty-five and Medina at one hundred. How strange! At that time, Ding's score stopped progressing, while Medina showed his magic with every shot, scoring twenty-three, sixty-three, twenty-one, and after twenty, adding another shot of twenty-four, surpassing with two hundred and ninety-four to two hundred and eighty-one, almost reaching three hundred points. Ding Mingyi then lost fourteen points with a total of two hundred and eighty-six. The result of the five rounds was that Portugal won by thirty-two points. The highest records were Medina at twenty-two, twenty-three, sixty-three, twenty-one, twenty, and twenty-four; Ding Mingyi at thirty-one, twenty-one, twenty-one, thirty-six, twenty-four, and twenty-two.

### Western Youth Basketball

Hornets Lose to Mai Lingjia, Xintong Fortunate to Win Against Mai Lingyi

There were three Western Youth basketball games last night. In the first game, the Western Youth Brave team forfeited in the ordinary group, and the Tax College won without effort. In the second game, the Hornet fought against Mai Lingjia in the independent group. The Hornets were initially very impressive, leading twice at ten to six and fifteen to fourteen. However, within three minutes of the break, Locke of Mai Ling scored six goals in a row, reversing the score to twenty-six to fifteen. The Hornets never recovered after this. After the resumption of the game, they continued to lose points, and were eventually defeated with a score of fifty-eight to twenty-nine. In the final game, Xintong played against Mai Lingyi. Carson, Shi Guia, Lan Yin, and Lan Jin all played for Xintong. Mai Ling was initially sharp, staying within one or two points, and once led with sixteen to ten. The Xintong basket was often harassed, and Mai Ling led with eighteen to twelve at the end of the first half. After the resumption of the game, Xintong still did not show any improvement, leading with twenty-one to fourteen, still seven points ahead. Although Lan Yin scored, Mai Ling tied the score at twenty-three to sixteen. Lan Yin used his old tricks, first serving under the basket and making consecutive contributions, finally surpassing with twenty-four to twenty-three. As time ran out, the game ended in a stalemate, with Xintong fortunately winning by thirty-four to twenty-seven. There are five games today, starting at 4:00 PM. The ordinary group accounts for four of them, and one is the university group game between Nanjing University and St. John's University, which should be very exciting.

### Donghua Reserve Team Fights Two Battles in Nanjing

The Donghua Reserve Team made a trip to the capital on New Year's Day and fought two battles, winning one and drawing one. After the game, some of the team members rushed back on the 3rd to participate in the A-group league match against Jinan University. The detailed details of the two matches in Nanjing have already been disclosed by the Nanjing side. We are now publishing them as a supplement.

Versus Mixed Team

On January 1st, 1937, the Donghua Reserve Team played its first match against the Nanjing Mixed Team at the Jinling University field. The time was 3:30 PM, and the referee was Xu Shaowu. Although Donghua had just removed its armor after a long journey, it still won by a large margin of four to zero. No less than 5,000 people came to watch the game. In the first half, Jia Jiliang and Luo Haiguang each scored a goal, leading by two to zero. In the second half, Jia and Wu Binghao each scored two more goals, resulting in a final score of four to zero. The defenders Li Yichen, Ding Zhaocheng, and Jin Jiabiao were the most meritorious, saving dangerous balls many times, which cannot be ignored. The Nanjing team was a collection of the elite of the capital, and although they suffered defeat, they cannot be said to be incompetent. The starting lineups of both sides are as follows:

Versus Jinling

The second game was against the Jinling University and Middle School Mixed Team, with referee Ni Zeshun. There were even more spectators than yesterday, because Jinling gathered the strength of both the university and middle school departments, which was much stronger than the Nanjing Mixed Team. Its university department defeated St. John's University of Shanghai five to zero last winter, and its middle school department won the Jiangzhe Private Middle School Football Championship last winter. Five minutes after the start of the game, Jinling's offensive was extremely strong, and Donghua's goal was overwhelmed. Both sides played brilliantly, earning a lot of applause. Until the first half was about to end, Donghua's right winger Wen Zhihao crossed the ball, and Jinling's He Homin inadvertently scored an own goal, leading by one goal to end the half. In the second half, Jinling's inside defender Wang Binsheng committed a foul, and Luo Haiguang lightly scored a penalty kick, giving Donghua a two-goal lead and a powerful momentum. Unexpectedly, with only minutes remaining, Wang Jiasheng saved a high ball, and Jinling's He Xuequan tripped and was injured, allowing Jinling's Yu Helong to open the scoring, making it two to one. Jinling's momentum was greatly boosted, and the cheers were like thunder. Soon, Jinling's He Xuequan received assistance from Deng Yunsen and created a two-to-two draw to end the game. The best performers that day were Li Yichen, and the central defenders Jin Ding and Shu were also good. Jia Jiliang was worse than the previous day. Wen Zhihao, Luo Haiguang, and Wu Binghao also worked hard. The Jinling generals ran quickly, but their shooting skills were poor. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

### Shanghai Automobile Association Annual Meeting

### Letter from Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College

The Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College sent a letter stating: "Dear Sir, yesterday your newspaper reported that there was a beating incident involving our school's students in the Tiecheng Cup basketball game on the 6th, which was probably based on a submission.

In addition to reporting the situation at the time to the Municipal Government and related agencies to thoroughly investigate the incident, after a thorough investigation and clarification of the truth and responsibility, we will publicly announce the entire situation. We hereby inform you in advance and hope that you will investigate and publish the original letter to correct the public's perception.

### Western League A Group Football Match: Jinan Today Fights Western Police

Zilin Elementary Two Cup Competitions Held for the Semi-Finals - Yesterday's Rain and Snow May Make Today's Match Difficult

There are six Western League football matches today. Two A-group matches, the Zilin and Elementary Two Cup semi-finals, and one each for the B and C groups. The Zhen Dan team has qualified for the semi-finals in both cups and must face both You You (Zilin Cup) and Jinde (Elementary Cup) strong teams at the same time, which is really not easy. In the A-group match, the Western Police's Yacha Xu will personally play. Jinan's hopes of winning against them are also very weak, but they should be able to resist stubbornly, and the score should not be too disparate. Yesterday there was heavy snow, and today it may be difficult to hold the match. Whether the match will be held can be inquired from each venue or by calling 16512 at 11:00 AM today. The schedule and lineup are as follows:

### City Museum to Open Tomorrow

Yesterday, a Report Was Made to the Press on the Preparation Process

Yesterday at 3 PM, the City Museum hosted members of the press, with over fifty reporters from various newspapers attending. The museum's director, Hu Zhaochun, the head of the general affairs department, Chen Duanzhi, and the head of the history department, Xu Weinan, were present to receive the guests. The event began with light refreshments in the reading room, followed by a report from Director Hu on the museum's preparatory process. Afterwards, the reporters were guided through the various rooms for a tour. The details are as follows:

Preparation Process

During the session, Director Hu provided a brief overview of the museum's preparation process and its significance, stating that museums, as modern cultural institutions dedicated to preserving human history, promoting education, and enhancing national awareness and research spirit, share a similar function with libraries in terms of cultural impact. Therefore, modern civilized cities invariably establish both libraries and museums. Shanghai's library system was established relatively early, while museums were notably absent. Recognizing this, the municipal authorities designated 300,000 yuan from the 3.5 million yuan in construction bonds issued in the 23rd year of the city's construction for museum construction expenses, with equipment costs separate. A provisional board of directors was established in March of the 24th year, and a preparatory office was established on November 15th of the 24th year to collect exhibits. The focus is entirely on Shanghai's history, including old Shanghai industries, the city's transportation and port facilities, models of important buildings, and various documents, all of which can demonstrate the traces of local development. Other items such as clothing, ornaments, coins, and entertainment tools can also provide insights into the changing customs of a particular time and place. Museums are not merely antique collections but should strive to fulfill their function and manifest their significance. The preparation time was very short, and the funding was limited, which made it difficult to achieve full satisfaction. However, thanks to the concern and attention of Mayor Wu and Chairman Ye Yuhu, and the guidance and support from various parties, such as Mr. Di Pingzi, Mr. Ding Fubao, and Mr. He Sui, valuable items were either deposited or donated. With the exception of paintings and calligraphy, which are temporarily limited to the Ming and Qing dynasties, the exhibits are arranged chronologically, presenting a rough system of the evolution of Chinese art and culture. The municipal government has approved a temporary annual operating budget of 50,000 yuan, which will be supplemented gradually to achieve perfection. After the speech, he led the reporters on a tour of the various rooms.

According to Director Hu, the museum spent countless efforts and materials, worth over a thousand yuan, to replicate this cabinet of hairstyles. The fourth room contains stone tools, jade artifacts, bronzes, pottery, seals, and currencies.

However, elementary school students are admitted free of charge when accompanied by their teachers. Director Hu told reporters that the museum originally did not want to charge admission fees for the sake of popularizing education. However, in light of the opening of the new municipal government building to the public, which resulted in the destruction of facilities by nearby ignorant villagers and costly repairs, fees are temporarily charged as a restriction. To facilitate visits, a joint ticket arrangement has been made with the China General Omnibus Company. Those who purchase tickets directly from the North Railway Station to the museum will pay only about 1.5 cents more than the regular bus fare.

HSBC's posted rates were both stable, and the silver equalization tax rose by half a cent. The Bank of Japan maintained the East exchange at a low price, and although the customer side was selling, it still had no impact. However, due to the further strengthening of exchange management by Japan, an order was issued yesterday stating that the purchase and sale of Japanese yen, with very few exceptions, must be approved by the government. The future is predictable. At noon yesterday, large Chinese merchants also sold East exchange, which caused the Sterling and US dollar to weaken due to a lack of support. Although Mobil and the Bank of Japan were buying later, they were still forced by the selling pressure, and the trend continued to be weak. At the close, recent selling prices, Sterling at 1 shilling 1 pence 53125 and 5625 paired, the US dollar at 29.78125, which were slightly looser compared to the previous close.

The exchange rate was still stable, and London spot gold rebounded by 1.5 pence. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both Sterling and the US dollar remaining stable, and the customs gold unit rising by 2 li. The standard gold bar price was also raised to 1151 yuan and 3 jiao. The public's sentiment was still not active, and some people were buying when prices were low. HSBC's posted rates were also stable and slightly raised, and although the silver equalization tax rose by half a cent, the spot price was slightly sold, and soon stabilized again. Later, due to the strengthening of the domestic market, the multi-party was pessimistic, and it once dropped slightly, but the result was still unchanged compared with the previous close, but the spot selling price was slightly more expensive. The spot swap was quoted by the deliverers at 1 yuan and 6 jiao. Today's market conditions are recorded below.

### Yarn and Cotton

Affected by the Osaka Sampin Market, Yarn and Cotton Prices Fluctuated Sharply. Morning prices surged due to reports of a surge in Sampin yarn prices, breaking the 50 yuan line in various months. In the afternoon, rumors of a reversal emerged, causing selling pressure to intensify and prices to plummet.

The yarn market initially rose and then fell, with an unusually complex trend, entirely influenced by the Osaka Sampin yarn market. In the early morning, Sampin yarn for the current month surged by nearly 11 yuan, shocking the market. Floating shorts turned long, and the market was tight. Prices for various months together broke through the 50 yuan mark. In the afternoon, Sampin yarn for the current month opened again at a high of 290.01 yuan. Unexpectedly, the close reversed, plunging 12 yuan, with the February contract plummeting 13.8 yuan. As soon as the news spread, selling pressure intensified, and the three markets plunged wildly by 1.8 or 9 yuan, again falling below the 50 yuan mark. The closing telecommunications of Sampin yarn confirmed the fall of the market.

The Listed Yarn Prices Fluctuated Violently

The listed yarn market opened in the morning, with prices rising uniformly across all months, with extreme enthusiasm. This was because Osaka Sampin yarn prices were soaring, jumping over 11 yuan for the current month, once reaching 289 yuan, causing excitement and short covering. Prices for various months rose above the 50 yuan mark, but there were no changes after the second session. The industry was gloomy because of weak sales in the spot yarn market and even narrower sales of coarse yarn. By the close, it was heard that Sampin yarn for the near month had fallen back by 2.4 yuan, and the far month had risen by 3.4 yuan, and the market rebounded again. As a result, various months rose by 1.3 to 4.2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market opened in the afternoon, with Sampin yarn for the current month breaking 290 yuan, reaching 290.01 yuan, with the atmosphere even more tense. Prices for various months rose by another yuan. A part of the second session had already received wireless news that Sampin yarn had fallen back by 12 yuan, and that the forward contract had already fallen by 1.3 yuan. At the same time, spot yarn trading was still sluggish. By the third close, the decline intensified, and the result was a sharp drop of 2.4, 5, 6 jiao to 3 yuan for various months compared to the morning close. It was found that 4,000 bales of Gengfeng were sold, 1,100 bales of Tongfu, 1,850 bales of Yuda, 1,400 bales of Jinchang, 1,800 bales of Mingde, 2,650 bales of Renfeng, 1,250 bales of Wangtai and Yi, 2,000 bales of Yicheng, 1,350 bales of Xiesheng, 1,300 bales of Hengchang, 1,450 bales of Daqing, and 1,950 bales of Wu Yi. The buyers were Juxing 1,650 bales, Dafeng 950 bales, Yiji 1,100 bales, Fengtai 1,250 bales, Dachangcheng 2,600 bales, Runkang 3,450 bales, Dachang 1,800 bales, Taichang 3,050 bales, Fukang 5,400 bales, and Shengyuan 1,750 bales.

Yarn Prices All Rose

Spot yarn sales were still good, with a total of 981 bales bought by various gangs throughout the day. The selling prices rose by one yuan and the thread rose by three yuan. The prices of the various gangs are listed below.

The cotton market was originally flat, but because the Sampin cotton market rose wildly step by step, it jumped three or four yuan. The American and Indian cotton markets also rebounded, and people were drawn into a good situation. In the afternoon, because the yarn market fell back, and it was rumored that the East was strengthening foreign exchange control, the market situation took a sharp turn, and the current month again fell below the three yuan mark.

Cotton Declined in the Near Month and Rose in the Far Month

The listed cotton market opened in the morning, and because the American and Indian cotton markets had risen, the people's hearts were lifted, and the yarn market turned high-flying, with the Osaka Sampin cotton futures jumping wildly over three yuan. The buying trend was even stronger. After the first session, it showed a slight setback, and as a result, various months rose by 3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon market opened, and because the Sampin cotton market opened again in the futures market, the buying increased slightly. However, some of the long positions took the opportunity to release a large amount of cotton. The second session opened with a weak yarn market, and the decline resumed, re-entering a tired path. As a result, various months fell by 4.5 to 5 jiao compared to the morning close. It was found that Dachangcheng sold 1,800 dan, Jinchang 4,300 dan, Senkang 2,700 dan, Fengtai 2,400 dan, Renfeng 3,400 dan, Taichang 3,500 dan, Shengyuan 3,700 dan, Fukang 3,400 dan, Tonghe 1,800 dan, and Xiesheng 1,100 dan.

The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Sampin Yarn Rose and Fell Wildly, Cotton Once Jumped Three or Four Yuan in the Morning

(Osaka, 8th) The prices of Sampin yarn fluctuated violently. In the morning, they rose wildly by more than ten yuan, and the afternoon rebound was also huge. As a result, various months still rose by 3 jiao to 1.4 yuan. The near-month closing price was 278.1 yuan, and the far-month was 259.3 yuan. In addition, cotton prices all rose by 1.75 yuan to 2.45 yuan. The near-month closing price was 73.4 yuan, and the far-month was 76.05 yuan.

American, British, and Indian Cotton All Rose

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the news from Liverpool was good. The cloth market was active, and industry players bought the near month. German transactions improved, and various months rose by three to seven pounds. Subsequently, long positions closed out, and Yaleo was shorted, with a slight reversal. However, at the low price of cotton pledged for loans, it immediately encountered resistance. Because five delivery notices for the January contract were issued, some long positions closed out. When the market closed, the stock market was strong, and there were hopes for resolving the labor unrest. The market price strengthened again. It is estimated that the spot price rose by 11 pounds, and the futures price fell by 1 pound to rise by 16 pounds. The British cotton spot price rose by 9 points, and the futures price rose by 56 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to short selling, and then rose due to the upward trend of Japanese yarn and large purchases by exporters. There were not many short sales and long positions taking profits. It is estimated that Pingle rose by 4 to 4.5 rupees, Omar rose by 3.75 to 4.25 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 3.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th).

According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 8th was Bai Luoxi at 230.5 rupees, Omar at 208 rupees, and Pingle at 178.25 rupees, all up by 0.75 rupees.

### Grain

Buying Momentum Returns, Flour and Wheat Prices Rebound Strongly

After the flour market opened, the prices for various months showed a sharp rebound.  Foreign wheat quotations saw Chicago rise by six to four jiao (tenths of a yuan), Canada rise by about six to seven jiao, and Liverpool rise by two pence zero.  After the opening prices were announced, the market had been falling for two or three consecutive days without any sign of reversing.  Speculators outside the industry suddenly became active, and because only four months of futures were being traded, the market was not smooth.  Therefore, as soon as buying increased, prices were easily pushed up.  Opening prices for both near-term and long-term futures rose by five to six fen (hundredths of a yuan) compared to the previous day.  A slight pullback was observed during the second trading session, but the bullish momentum persisted, boosting market sentiment.  When the market opened in the afternoon, trading volume for various months was sluggish, and prices tended to fluctuate.  The focus of competition currently shifts entirely with foreign quotations.  However, those at the center of the industry believed that market values were already high, and there were not many inquiries.

After the wheat market opened in the morning, prices for various months showed a uniform upward trend.  Foreign wheat quotations rebounded by four to six or seven jiao.  Given the continuous decline for several days since the market opened, a rebound was inevitable.  Therefore, opening prices for various months were raised accordingly.  Near-term futures rose by eight to nine fen, while long-term futures rose by more than one jiao.  Although there was a surplus of domestic wheat, it was scattered among merchants and difficult to concentrate.  Therefore, people's sentiment was easily stirred at the first opportunity.  When the market opened in the afternoon, there was very little trading in the current month, while outsiders resumed buying long-term futures, tightening market sentiment.  The price of new wheat for June did not rise much because of the recent snowfall, which calmed people's minds.  Fuxin Flour Mill imported 2,000 bags of wheat at a slightly higher price of two to three fen.  Wheat from Kaiyao Bay, Yanghe, and Huaian ranged from six yuan five jiao seven or eight fen to six yuan four jiao five fen.

Rice Shipments from the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River in Rain and Snow Are Scarce

(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were over eighty firms from various provinces, with 16,400-16,500 shi (a unit of dry measure) of goods, including over forty firms dealing in inferior rice.  The local market was watching and waiting, as demand remained weak.  Only the Qingdao firms handled over 1,000 bags of inferior rice.  Most of the goods in the market failed to trade, and the situation weakened further.  However, sellers, seeing the rain and snow, and considering their relationship with the mainland, held firm, forming a stable situation.  Prices for thick and thin粳(jīng) rice remained unchanged, while various grades of Duyangjian (杜洋尖) and Yinyuan (陰元) rice remained stable.

(Shanghai North) Yesterday, shipments from various routes along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were quite abundant, with approximately fifty to sixty firms and three hundred sixty to three hundred seventy boats moored along the river.  Due to the continuous rain and snow, few shops were open in the market, and trading in various goods was limited.  However, warehouse owners of white粳(jīng) rice seized the opportunity to profit, and the price of white粳(jīng) rice rose by a few fen to one jiao.  The price of inferior rice rose by a few fen, and the price of early rice followed closely, rising by nearly one jiao.  The price of Baiyuan (白元) rice rose by slightly more than one jiao, while the price of Yangdubukejian (羊杜埠客尖) rice rose by five to six fen.  The prices of other goods remained weak.

Glutinous Rice Trading in the Local Market Is Quite Active

Yesterday, the market for客秈(kè xiān) rice was quite lively, with prices for all types of milled rice rising, especially Yuanmi (元米), which was actively traded in the local market, leading to a tighter market.  Prices were two to two and a half jiao higher than the previous day.  Prices for other milled rice also rose by one to one and a half jiao each.  When the market opened in the morning, local merchants had ample inventory, and rice prices were stable, with only three to five thousand bags traded.  Subsequently, merchants from the Guangdong Oil and Liang gangs continued to inquire, and Zhengzhou also actively traded in milled late-season rice.  The local market became even more eager and focused on milled Yuanmi (元米), causing a sudden sharp rise in the market.  If shipments continue to be strong today and tomorrow, the market may need to rise further.  A total of 500 bags of Yongyuan (甬元) rice, 1,000 bags of Han milled rice, 8,200+ bags of Gan rice, and 4,643 bags of Xiang rice were traded throughout the day.

### Securities

Public Bonds Fluctuate with a Slightly Soft Trend, Reconstruction Bonds Not Traded All Day

Yesterday, the public bond market was extremely weak due to the unchanged political situation.  Market conditions became increasingly sluggish, as both bulls and bears remained firm, adopting a wait-and-see approach.  Market prices fluctuated minimally, showing a fluctuating trend.  Many bulls closed out positions for profit, leading to a slight weakening.  However, the trend is still brewing and waiting.  Reconstruction bonds were not traded at all because of the shortage of chips and high prices.  When the market opened in the morning, numbers like 77•35 were actively selling, and market prices fell by one to one and a half jiao.  However, many retail investors were still buying, and the trend in the second session shifted from weak to firm.  Numbers like Wuding (戊丁) 10•77 were still selling heavily, falling by a small five fen to three jiao.  Numbers 35•45 turned to buying.  Grade B bonds rose by one to two jiao starting next month.  When the market opened in the afternoon, market conditions became dull and chaotic again.  Number 5 had strong buying interest, and numbers Ding (丁) and Bing (丙) were up by about one jiao.  Wujia (戊甲) this month and Grade B next month were down by a small five fen.  Trading volume at the close was sparse, with very few transactions by large investors, and retail investors also bought and sold unevenly.  Market prices generally fluctuated between five fen and one jiao.  Overall, the result for the day was a slight decline of five fen to one jiao.  The total transaction volume was 3,235,000 yuan.  A table comparing the rise, fall, high, and low prices is shown below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)

### Sugar Market

Domestic Green Sugar Prices Continue to Rise Sharply, Truly Rare During the New Crop Season

The combined company yesterday was the third bidding period of the week, with a total of 2,500 bags of Shunde Wuyang Coarse White at 22 yuan, a rise of 1 jiao, all cleared. It is rumored that it will need to be increased by another 2 jiao starting next week.

### Dried and Preserved Goods

Black Melon Seeds Rise Again

Due to Lack of Inventory in Production Areas

Recently, black melon seeds have been rising repeatedly in the market due to the scarcity of inventory in various production areas.  The scarce inventory has led to price increases, tightening the market.  Yesterday, the market price of Mingguang seeds opened at 20 yuan, another increase of one yuan compared to before.  Other higher-quality goods also rose by one or two yuan.  Even various熟貨(shú huò) melon seed companies on the local street were buying.  There was also buying interest from the mainland, while export gangs were less active.  The market price for Jikui seeds was 25 yuan, Tizhuang seeds 24 yuan, Xukui seeds 22 yuan and a half, Mingguang seeds 19 yuan and a half, and Linhuaiguan了(le) seeds 19 yuan.  The market may tighten further in the future.

### Silk and Tea

Yinzhuang Silk Sales Recover

Yesterday, overseas silk markets saw slight gains in both Japan and the United States, but not as high as previous market records. Yokohama spot goods rose by 10 yuan, and long-term futures rose by 17 yuan. New York near-term goods rose by one and a half to two fen. Lyon silk prices remained unchanged. Sales of Shanghai Baichang county silk for export were sluggish. Only Dachang and other firms bought 50 dan (a unit of weight) of high-grade Baichang silk yesterday. In addition, sales of Yinzhuang silk have recovered. It is expected that after the expiration of the Japan-India trade agreement, Chinese silk sales to India will recover. Yesterday, Samsung, Kechang, and other firms purchased 100+ dan of Jili and Shuanggong silk. Prices for goods were brisk. User silk and Hangzhou silk purchases were also strong. Prices for Baichang Tiantai grade heavy reeling silk, sold at 805研(yán), remained stable. Yesterday, a total of 262 bales were traded in the city.

### Metals

Local Nail Manufacturers Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell Stockpiles, Blue Lead Iron in Short Supply and Prices Soar

Local metal nail manufacturers are taking advantage of high prices to sell stockpiles because foreign nail factories lack raw materials (i.e., cracked nail metal wire).  Consequently, the price of 倍司(bèi sī) has been rising steadily, with the highest price reaching 11 yuan per barrel.  However, factories did not ship much, causing buyers to lament.  In recent days, warehouse owners who had previously purchased goods have been eager to sell at the current high prices.  Therefore, the market has seen large quantities of spot goods being sold off in recent days.  Yesterday, 2,000 barrels were opened, with the price at 10 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per barrel.  However, trading at hardware stores and inter-dealer transactions still required 11 yuan to 11 yuan and 5 jiao.

Blue lead iron has recently been selling in spot markets.  New goods have not arrived, and prices have been rising steadily, selling at 21 yuan per box (original box).  Scrap iron in 14-inch and 20-inch lengths costs 33 yuan and 5 jiao, while 20-inch and 28-inch lengths cost 34 yuan.  Yesterday, four or five斗箱(dǒu xiāng) were opened in the market and purchased by printing and canning factories.  Since there were no spot goods for merchant-to-merchant sales, no new goods were opened.  New goods are expected to arrive for loading early next month.

Women's Supplement

### The Three Major Premises That Women Should Strive for This Year

— Weijing

The year 1936 is over. What contributions have women made to society and the country in the past year? I will not discuss it in detail here. Anyway, speaking of it, extravagance and laziness have occupied most of the page. However, let the past be the past. In this coming year, I hope women will make some progress in their work, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past year.

To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past year, I believe the following three points cannot be ignored:

(1) Promotion of Labor: In the past year, civic training, labor service, and so on have sprung up everywhere. The decadent atmosphere in the country has been revitalized. Originally, "Strengthening the country starts with strengthening the body" is something every elementary school student knows. Moreover, in this extraordinary period, a strong body is even more indispensable. However, it is a great pity that in the past year's civic training, labor service, and so on, men have taken the lead. In ordinary families, men go to the playground early in the morning, while women are still dreaming in bed. Men carry hoes and shovels to build roads and dredge rivers, while women just hide at home, playing cards and having fun. And the more educated women are, the more they indulge in such comfortable pleasures. This kind of attitude is absolutely unacceptable. Women are also masters of the Republic of China and are equally responsible as men for reviving the nation. To shoulder this important task, it is essential to have the spirit and body to endure hard work and hardship. Therefore, I hope that educated women will, from today onwards, lead the promotion of labor and join labor groups.

(2) Maintaining Personal Integrity: It is indeed beyond reproach for women to engage in occupations. However, in reality, the big hat of women's occupations conceals many unspeakable darknesses. In our society, there are quite a few profit-seeking merchants who use women to attract customers. These professional women, who are only used to attract customers, are in reality selling themselves in the name of occupations, which has almost become an undeniable fact in this era. The guide agencies that were popular for a while last year but have now been banned are one example. However, occupations are not divided into noble and lowly. The original purpose of women's occupations was simply to promote an independent life of self-reliance. Therefore, it is not absolutely impossible for women to be guides. However, the first element is that "self-reliance" must not be forgotten. Those who can be self-reliant, even if they are female workers, are very sacred. Those who do not work and gain, even if they are sitting in big chairs in the office, are just vases. Therefore, I hope that women in the professional circle will, from today onwards, not accept a penny more than the reward they deserve for their knowledge or labor, so as to preserve their integrity.

(3) Social Service: This is a requirement for ordinary women who are well-fed all day long and do nothing. The social service mentioned here does not refer to seeking employment. My intention is simply to ask housewives to strive for some social undertakings. For example, in the literacy education for the common people that was held last year, many housewives oppressed their servants, not allowing them to attend classes, otherwise threatening them with dismissal. Just this one incident fully demonstrates our attitude towards social welfare undertakings. To give another example, such as the recent aid-to-Suiyuan movement. There were indeed those who worked hard to sew or donate silk-cotton vests, but there were also those who were stingy in giving their children a small donation for aid to Suiyuan. These are indeed extremely worrying phenomena for the future of the country and the nation. Therefore, I hope that ordinary housewives will, from today onwards, not place themselves outside of society. Rather, they must regard society as their own family.

### Several Women Worth Praising

— Zongxu

Madam Han Shizhong: Han Shizhong, whose courtesy name was Shizhong, was a national hero who lived at the same time as Yue Wumu (Yue Fei). His wife was the famous Liang Hongyu. The story in the Yue Biography about her bombing the Two Wolf Passes with cannons is a vivid description by novelists, and the world's worship of her is said to have largely originated from this. But she was not only brave but also wise. Helin Yulu once recorded an anecdote about her, saying that after she married General Han, he performed outstanding feats and became a famous general, so she was named the Lady of Two Kingdoms. One day, General Han invited Wuzhu to Huangtiandang and almost captured him, but due to a moment of carelessness, Wuzhu dug a river and escaped. Madam Han was furious when she heard the news and immediately submitted a memorial, saying: "Shizhong lost the opportunity to let the enemy go, please add punishment." Everyone in the court was moved by this. Her wisdom and heroism were such that, can such a figure be found in today's women's circles?

Madam Zhou Yuji: Zhou Yuji was the General Commander of Bingwu Pass in the late Ming Dynasty. He died with the city when the rebel Li Zicheng attacked. He was posthumously named Zhongwu. There is a Kunqu opera called "Bie Mu Luan Jian" (Farewell Mother Amidst a Rain of Arrows), which tells his tragic story. His wife, Madam Liu, followed her husband in the marshal's tent, loved to read books on military strategy, and repeatedly helped her husband achieve extraordinary feats. After Zhou Yuji died in battle, she supervised women in street fighting. The number of rebels she killed was nearly ten thousand until the arrows ran out, and then she committed suicide to show her loyalty. The History of the Ming Dynasty included her in the biography of Zhou Yuji. Wei Minguo Gong Xiangshu of Shanxi had a poem praising her, titled: "When the rebel Li Zicheng captured Baowu Pass in the year Jia Shen, General Commander Zhou died in battle." The poem says: "Shouting loudly, the High Emperor came out of the city, the only one in three hundred years. Many warriors offered him wine, and a lone minister hoisted the banner before the army. He was not ashamed to be a true man when wrapped in a shroud, and it was heard that a woman wore armor. If the general were still alive, how dare the comet approach the imperial court." The so-called "it was heard that a woman wore armor" refers to his wife.

Madam Yang Chengzhai: Yang Chengzhai was a great Confucian of the Song Dynasty. His son, Dongshan, served as the Prefect of our Huzhou, so Mr. Chengzhai visited Xinshi. The Deqing County Annals have his poems to check. His wife, Luo, was over seventy years old. Every cold month at dawn, she would get up early and go to the kitchen to personally make a pot of porridge, which she would share with the servants before ordering them to do their respective duties. Her son, Mr. Dongshan, said to her: "Mother, why do you make yourself suffer so much?" Madam said: "Servants are also human beings. In the cold morning, their stomachs must have some warmth before they can serve." Mr. Dongshan said: "Mother is old, and this is a lowly task. Why do you do things backwards?" Madam said angrily: "I enjoy this. You do not know the cold. If you say this, you will certainly not be able to do as I do." Mr. Dongshan did not dare to say anything more. Moreover, Madam usually wore only silver jewelry and clothing made of silk and coarse silk. She gave birth to four sons and three daughters, and all of them were breastfed by her. She once said to others: "To have the children of hungry people breastfeed my children, what kind of heart is that?" (See Helin Yulu) Such a woman is truly rare in ancient and modern times. It would not be an exaggeration to use her as a model of a virtuous wife and good mother.

Madam Wang Weimei: Wang Weimei, whose courtesy name was 渢(fēng), was a native of Qiantang, Zhejiang. He was aloof and seldom harmonious with others, so everyone called him Wang Leng. In the late Ming Dynasty, he passed the provincial examination. Prefect Qian admired his talent and promised his daughter to Weimei. When they got married, the bride entered the house with grand decorations. Weimei was very disapproving of this and warned her not to do this in the future. So she discarded her ornaments and dismissed her maids, doing the work herself in coarse cloth. The young couple respected each other like guests. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, Weimei, bearing the pain of the fallen country, abandoned the imperial examinations. Some of his relatives by marriage hoped that he would become an official and wanted to force him to take the Ministry of Rites examination. Fearing that Weimei would not agree, they showed her a thousand taels of silver, saying: "If you can persuade your husband to take the exam, I will give this to you." She replied: "My husband cannot be persuaded, and I do not love this money either." She ultimately fulfilled her husband's integrity. It is truly admirable that a mere woman can understand the righteousness so deeply. (See Erlin Ju Ji) Those who accept bribes and lead their husbands into injustice should feel ashamed in front of this madam.

There are many women worth praising throughout ancient and modern times, but due to the limited space in this publication, I have only listed the above four. Among these four, there are those with wisdom, benevolence, and courage, which can serve as a reference for general women in the current extraordinary period. Because in extraordinary times, there is a particularly urgent need for such typical women.

### Women's Life in the Suburbs of Beijing

— Zhengyan

The rural families in the suburbs of Beiping (Beijing) are mostly extremely poor. Nine out of ten villagers in the four suburban areas make a living by farming. However, due to years of drought, the harvest of soybeans, wheat, and other crops is not good, and their livelihoods are even more difficult. Others who work as stone masons or carters are even more miserable. Therefore, the women in the suburbs of Beijing are naturally struggling in a dark life in this kind of family environment.

However, "the more impoverished and difficult, the more vigorous the spirit of diligence and endurance"; the women in the four suburbs of Beiping are worthy of this kind of praise. They only know how to resist the harsh surroundings and do not grieve or curse their fate. That is, in addition to taking care of household chores all day long and helping the men with farming in the fields, they also have several fixed side jobs, which are weaving mats, weaving cattails, embroidery, needlepoint, and sewing, etc. Whenever they have a little free time, it is their working time, even at night until midnight; to increase the family income.

Among several side jobs, embroidery and needlepoint are better. They mostly work for the general embroidery shops in Ping City, and they are paid according to the amount of production (there are very few female workers). Usually, one person can earn three, four jiao to six, seven jiao per day, while those who weave mats can only earn two or three jiao per day. Those who sew and wash clothes also earn about two or three jiao. The forms of weaving cattails are different, including cattail hats, cattail shoes, cattail hoops, cattail cushions, etc. Often, it takes half a day to a day to weave each item, but the price at which it is sold only gets one or two jiao. Some can only be exchanged for a dozen copper coins, which is even more difficult. However, due to the decline of the embroidery industry in Beiping in recent years and the increased number of women learning embroidery, embroidery is also much worse than before and is very meager!

Most pitiful are the extremely poor families. Girls from seven, eight years old to over ten years old, wearing ragged and unclean clothes, crouching and walking in the suburbs all day long; picking up the firewood left on the ground. Especially in the autumn and winter seasons, when the northwest wind blows from the Mongolian plateau, sand and stones fly, obscuring the face, and the climate changes from cold to frostbite; their firewood picking work is even more diligent, enduring hunger and cold. Originally, this firewood, in addition to the occasional pieces dropped by those who went out to chop firewood, was mostly blown down by hurricanes that broke tree branches and was mostly blown in from other highland areas, so the more it gets to winter, the more the wind blows and the trees wither, the more firewood is left. The price they get for selling this firewood is about 20-30 yuan per year for older girls and only about 10 yuan for younger ones. The misery can be known!

After reading this article, we can also imagine what the life of poor women in urban Beiping is like? However, the virtuous and good women who are brave to endure hardship for the family are happy and do not complain. It is a pity that in recent years, the intensified foreign aggression has made their lives especially painful!

### Seeing Women's Patriotic Strength from the Aid-to-Suiyuan Movement

— Yingdai

In the eyes of a group of old-fashioned people, women are different from men in status. Apart from holding children and taking care of cooking and sewing at home, they should not be involved in any work. It is even more out of the question to say that they have obligations to fulfill and rights to enjoy for the country and society. However, the fact is not like this. Women have their own considerable strength, which we cannot underestimate. Especially in the matter of the aid-to-Suiyuan movement, we have clearly seen what the strength of women is.

Since the bandits and puppets attacked Suiyuan, and the people of the whole country unanimously participated in the aid-to-Suiyuan work, the women's circles did not lag behind. In Shanghai, the leaders of various women's groups united to organize the "Women's Circles Suiyuan Bandit Suppression and慰勞(wèiláo) Association", running around and calling for donations and various useful items to comfort the soldiers at the front. The results achieved by the ladies participating in the aid-to-Suiyuan work are also very impressive. There are also female students from various schools who have stopped classes to sew silk-cotton vests. Many women who are studying medicine want to go to the front line to serve and rescue the wounded. Even the female workers in silk factories and yarn factories donate their labor income for aid to Suiyuan. Moreover, many poor girls voluntarily knit wool to make a living and donate to the front. Therefore, the aid-to-Suiyuan movement can be said to have become widespread throughout the women's circles, and the strength is certainly not small. Shanghai is like this, and the women's circles in the inland are just like Shanghai, not lagging behind in saving the country.

Here, what is the patriotic strength of women? It has clearly told us in participating in the aid-to-Suiyuan movement. Originally, the 450 million people of China, if women are removed, the number of men is probably less than half. Therefore, if only men are allowed to do the aid-to-Suiyuan movement, the actual effect obtained will probably be less than half. On the other hand, if women also rise up to participate, the strength will increase a lot. In this extraordinary period, to demand the self-reliance of the Chinese nation, it is only possible to save the nation by having the entire nation, regardless of men, women, old and young, each contribute their own strength and participate in practical work. Then how can we underestimate women!

### Excerpts from Women's Lives in Various Regions

— Yun Xun

The author recently interviewed several female students from different regions, asking them to share the state of women's lives in their respective areas. I have omitted the many clichés, but have selected specific aspects of their active lives and presented them as fragments. If further information is gathered in the future, it will be contributed to our readers.

Enshi County, Hubei Province: The area is extremely impoverished, a very underdeveloped lower county. There are a few folk rhymes circulating in Enshi County: "No three days of sunshine, no three feet of flat land, no three taels of silver for the people." This describes the excessive rainfall, unsuitable for farming, resulting in barren land and poor people. No one owns more than three taels of silver, illustrating the extent of the poverty. Women in Enshi are physically strong, accustomed to labor, carrying loads of eighty or ninety catties on their shoulders, which is commonplace. Women manage both household and external affairs, taking charge of family finances and engaging in outside business. Women are found in all sorts of places. The men smoke and gamble, making it a routine, becoming idle and indulging themselves at home. Outsiders might mistakenly think they were in Korea upon witnessing such indolent and degenerate behavior. They don’t rely on their husbands! Many men are actually dependent on their wives! They don't wear any ornaments from head to toe, maintaining their natural appearance.

Java, Dutch East Indies: These few words certainly cannot represent the entire lives of Javanese women, let alone the women of the entire Dutch East Indies. The local gentry value men over women, a deeply ingrained habit that is hard to reverse. Educated women are as rare as phoenix feathers and enjoy a more privileged life. Ordinary women still till the fields, plant crops, or climb mountains to chop firewood. Many also go to the market to do business, supplementing the family income. Elderly women manage the meals. Middle-aged and young women, lacking enough food and clothing, go to foreigners' homes during the day or at night to give massages, earning a few cents to support their lives. This massage work is said to be very common, with women soliciting business door-to-door as a routine matter. However, it is limited to massage only and cannot be compared to the popular tuina or massage in domestic cities.

Chaozhou, Guangdong: Women's revolutionary ideas are extremely surging. Their actions are progressive, unwilling to fall behind. They engage in women's movements, not allowing metropolitan areas to claim exclusive rights. Poor women work all day to achieve economic independence. Women from wealthy families are also unwilling to sit idle and must find some easy crafts. They believe that "humans are working animals! We women are humans! Therefore, we should work!" They consider labor to be the duty of a human being.

Tiger Beach, Dalian: Tiger Beach is near the coast, and most residents are fishermen. Women living in this environment naturally put effort into "fishing." They twist ropes and weave nets, making it a year-round source of income. A few women also fish with the men. When the husbands and brothers set out to fish, they are usually gone for several days. The women prepare some palatable dishes in advance, providing them with several days of food. Before they leave, the women line the coast, seeing them off. Young couples often exchange kisses and say many auspicious words. When the boats are about to return, the women prepare the containers to load the fish in advance. If the return is delayed, they fear they have encountered danger at sea! They silently weep all day or piously go to the temple to worship Buddha.

### Contribution from the Conscience

### Newspaper-selling Women in Changzhou City

— Jun Ying

Even if women in Changzhou know a few words, are beautiful, and of marriageable age, there are very few opportunities for them. Recently, a certain newspaper office recruited literate women to sell newspapers, considering it a new foundation for promoting women's occupations. Once this trend started, other newspapers competed to follow suit. For a time, in the lonely city, one could often see these young women, heavily made up, selling newspapers in large quantities, which was truly novel and could be compared to the flower-selling girls of Suzhou.

Speaking of their lives, they experience a great deal of pain, both mentally and materially. Every day, they carry rolls of newspapers, selling them to passersby in a gentle voice. One can often see them selling newspapers to customers in poor streets, remote alleys, teahouses, and hotels.

Their monthly salary is only eight or nine yuan. Aside from a small portion spent on cosmetics and clothing, most of it is given to support the family. Despite the meager pay, they are still required to have a graceful figure, be literate, and be able to announce the news printed in the daily newspaper to be fortunate enough to be hired by the newspaper office.

Corrupt elements in society are inevitable. They are often deceived by money or other reasons and are often exploited. Some even pretend to buy newspapers to flirt with them intentionally. They experience a great deal of mental anguish. The difficulty of women standing on their own in society in the interior is apparent.

Please save on cosmetics and help the soldiers on the front lines fighting the enemy!

Please sew cotton clothes and send them to the soldiers in the snowy front lines!

Please study first aid techniques and prepare to serve on the front lines!

### To: Sisters Who Are First-Time Mothers!

— Pei Lu

Ten Commandments for Child Rearing

Young sisters! As you become a mother for the first time and raise your own little angel, I know that you not only have no experience to make your child fat, strong, lively, and adorable, but also may expose your child to unexpected dangers. Therefore, here I will write down some common knowledge about raising a child for the first time!

㊀ Do not feed the child with your mouth, because adults' mouths often contain bacteria that can be transmitted to the child. The child's resistance is weak, which can easily lead to illness and is very dangerous!

㊁ When the child cries, do not immediately breastfeed. First, feeding when the child is angry can hinder digestion. Second, when the child is still sobbing, it is easy to inhale milk into the trachea, causing coughing.

㊂ In winter, do not cover the child's head in the quilt during sleep. Children, like adults, need fresh air.

㊃ When the child wants to sleep, do not shake them excessively to urge them to fall asleep sooner, because it will make their head dizzy and eventually numb. Even after falling asleep, they often cry or laugh in their dreams. You should let them fall asleep naturally.

㊄ Children's nerves are very sensitive and easily startled. Therefore, they should sleep in a quiet place during the day, and noisy places should be avoided nearby.

㊅ Do not let the child's eyes stare straight or squint at a certain place for a long time to avoid creating crossed eyes or squint eyes.

㊆ Do not let the child put their hands in their mouth to avoid unnecessary loss of saliva and to avoid more opportunities to contact illnesses.

㊇ When the child's legs are not strong enough, do not force them to stand upright to avoid injury to the joints or creating X-shaped legs or Q-shaped legs.

㊈ In summer, in addition to breastfeeding, you should give them more boiled water, because children also sweat a lot and consume a lot of water. Do not just use milk to satisfy hunger and quench thirst. Eating too much milk easily causes indigestion.

㊉ Children's clothes, whether in winter or summer, should be loose and not too small to avoid hindering breathing and harming the lungs.

That's all! I offer these ten pieces of common sense about child-rearing to all the young sisters!

### "Misses' Must-Knows"

— Hu Yeyin

Recently, I have seen many articles like "Misses' Must-Knows" in publications combining text and illustrations. After reading them, I often have a bad feeling. For example, in a publication called "Miss," I found a gentleman setting down many rules as if they were laws. I will copy a few below:

If you dream of kissing a man, then quickly beware of meeting a swindler soon.

Pay attention to the man's hand moving onto your body, he will definitely stop at many stations.

When you like to eat sour things, eat them less in front of men.

In spring, avoid touching soft things; in summer, avoid touching sticky things.

If you are studying at a co-educational school, you might as well not answer when male professors ask you questions.

It is best not to eat bananas, as this will cause you to lose the beauty of your finger curves.

When you see a flower, you should think that someone will come to pick it temporarily.

Okay! Okay! I don't need to copy anymore. I must save the time of the printer because these things are basically worthless. Their value, besides giving bored ladies of the leisure class something to pass the time after meals, is simply useless.

Moreover, judging from the few rules copied above, some are simply unreasonable, such as the first one. Some are just saying witty things. I believe that some young women may get angry after reading them.

Since the May Fourth Movement, young women have awakened themselves and demanded their own status, shouting for equality and wanting to break free from the shackles of men. Being men's playthings is a great shame. But, it has already been twenty-five years of the Republic of China! And the "Misses' Must-Knows" still contain such provisions. I can't help but sigh for the young women!

Everyone understands the position China is in now and what China needs now. Therefore, for the future of the nation and the future of the country, I cannot but blame the authors of the "Misses' Must-Knows," because they are irresponsible. They aim to cater to the needs of the leisure class, and they ignore the needs of the times. After scolding them severely, I will write another "Misses' Must-Knows" as follows:

㊀ Pay attention to your own position, pay attention to your surroundings; beware of those insidious poisonous arrows.

㊁ When you are truly bored, do not read publications combining text and illustrations of the "Miss" type.

㊂ Do your part to eliminate all the poisonous arrows for your female compatriots; start a great cleaning movement.

㊃ Men and women are originally the same people. Women do not need to hide and dodge in front of men. On the contrary, they should be like men, acting as the vanguard of the times!

㊄ Losing the beauty of curves is not a woman's shame, but those who make you lose your soul are your mortal enemies!

㊅ Spring is the time for growth, and summer is the time for flourishing. Therefore, the beginning of spring should have good plans, and the arrival of summer is precisely when the work is most intense.

Okay! Okay! I can stop here too! The more I write, the more there is, but the most important thing is still that I hope my female compatriots value themselves, work hard for the country and for the nation, move forward, and seek the path to light!

### Announcement: Our Publication Opens a "Women's Appeal" Column

### Hangyu Section Replaces Heavy Rails: Formal Signing of an 8.8 Million Yuan Loan Contract

Silver group 2.8 million yuan, materials 6 million yuan, term 6 years, interest 9% and 4%

Rail replacement project scheduled to begin in mid-June and be completed.

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau decided to replace the 35-pound light rails of the Hangyu section with 63-pound heavy rails, so that it could uniformly run heavy trains with the Yunan and Nanping sections. Zhang Zili, secretary of the council of the bureau, repeatedly contacted Jin Runquan, representative of the China, China Farmers, and Zhejiang Local banks and manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China. Jin came to Shanghai and reported to the head office, after which the Bank of China agreed to borrow 1.8 million yuan, and the China Farmers and Zhejiang Local banks each agreed to borrow 500,000 yuan. A draft agreement was first signed in Hangzhou on December 2 of last year, and after the bureau submitted it for approval at a council meeting held in Beijing on December 8 of the same month, the contract was officially signed at the end of the month.

Contract Summary

The main points of the loan contract are as follows: ㊀ Loan name: Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Hangyu Section Rail Replacement Loan, 2.8 million yuan in national currency; ㊁ Lending banks: Bank of China lends 1.8 million yuan, China Farmers Bank and Zhejiang Local Bank each lend 500,000 yuan; ㊂ Guarantee: The balance of the first phase of railway construction bonds and the increased passenger and freight income after the Hangyu section is replaced with heavy rails will be used as a guarantee; ㊃ Term and interest: Monthly interest rate of 9%; after the Yunan section loan is repaid, it will be repaid in installments over six years; ㊄ The Bank of China is designated as the representative of the syndicate. The signing representatives are Zeng Yangfu, chairman of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau Council, Jin Runquan, manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China, Wu Jingsheng, director of the Hangzhou office of the China Farmers Bank, and Xu Enpei, general manager of the Zhejiang Local Bank. There are four copies of the contract, each held by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, Bank of China, China Farmers Bank, and Zhejiang Local Bank, for record and reference.

Material Loan

In addition to the engineering costs for the Hangyu section's heavy rail replacement, which are borrowed from the Shanghai syndicate, all steel rails, sleepers, and other materials, totaling 28,000 tons and equivalent to 6 million yuan in national currency, have been negotiated by Zeng Yangfu and Chen Hualin, director of the Iron Department Purchasing Committee, with the Shanghai representative of the Czech merchant "Wisun Weis" (transliteration) steel mill. The supply is generally provided by the factory, with an annual interest rate of 4% and a term of six years. The contract has also been signed. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau issues promissory notes in accordance with the contract and repays the principal and interest in installments over six years. The Ministry of Railways serves as the guarantor. The required materials are notified to the factory's representative in Shanghai, who forwards them to the Czech Republic and ships them to China and Hangzhou for application as needed, depending on the needs of the project.

Starting Rail Replacement

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau was ordered to complete the Nanping section project by the end of March of this year. After the syndicate released the funds in advance, the progress of various projects was quite rapid and is expected to be completed on schedule by the end of March. The 25-pound light rails used in the Hangyu section are now being replaced with 63-pound heavy rails in sections. During the rail replacement period, passenger and freight trains on the Hangyu section will continue to operate as usual to facilitate traffic. It is expected that the entire replacement will be completed by mid-June, at which time the Hangyu, Yunan, and Nanping sections will be fully completed, and heavy trains with weights of 35 tons and 45 tons can be run, which will greatly facilitate passenger and freight transportation.

### Overseas Chinese Businessman Wu Zhuxuan Arrives in Shanghai from Siam

Negotiating the promotion of domestic products

Wu Zhuxuan, a tycoon of overseas Chinese in Siam and a member of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce, recently arrived in Shanghai to discuss with the domestic product industry in this port the promotion of domestic products in Siam. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed him and learned about the situation of overseas Chinese and domestic product sales in the area as follows:

Overseas Chinese are Concerned about the Motherland

Mr. Wu first stated that the number of overseas Chinese in Siam reaches 2.5 million, which is the largest number of overseas Chinese in any region. In recent years, due to the impact of the global economic downturn, there have been occasional unemployment problems. The businesses they operate themselves are mainly textiles and groceries. In the past, they were very ignorant of the motherland. In recent years, due to inspection groups visiting one after another, and the fact that domestic politics have been put on the right track, they have expressed great concern.

Japanese Merchants Have Strong Influence

Siam is an agricultural country. In recent years, it has gradually paid attention to commerce, and its political aspects are also trying to revitalize. However, the commercial influence of Japanese people in Siam is extremely strong. Their business methods are very accommodating. At the beginning of sales of various goods, prices are not considered. After sales channels gradually expand, contracts are signed. The prices are also low, which cannot be matched by other countries. They also use various methods to encourage merchants to promote sales. For example, those who sell the most Japanese goods can travel to Japan for free. The Siamese authorities consider Japanese goods convenient and claim that they are sufficient to revitalize the economy.

Opinions on Promoting Domestic Products

Overseas Chinese are now very concerned about the motherland and are happy to use domestic products. However, the prices of domestic products are slightly higher, and manufacturers are afraid to operate boldly. He came here specifically to negotiate promotion matters and has met with several manufacturers several times. He is responsible for the affairs of the Domestic Products Joint Venture in Siam. Siamese overseas Chinese merchants prefer to trade directly with the manufacturers, as their procedures are simpler. Therefore, he also hopes that domestic product manufacturers will adopt direct transaction methods. The best-selling domestic products in Siam are daily necessities and textiles.

Looking Forward to China-Siam Navigation

He had heard about the China-Siam navigation and hoped it would be realized soon to promote the development of domestic products. The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association will establish a domestic products office in Singapore, which will be the hub for promoting domestic products in Southeast Asia. He will stay in Shanghai for a longer period and continue to negotiate everything with the domestic product industry.

### National Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau Plans to Organize a Council

Close Liaison with Grain Merchants

Since the National Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau was formally established, it is now making internal arrangements. The Bureau is in charge of grain transportation and sales, and will definitely have close liaison with grain merchants in the future. Therefore, the Bureau is now preparing to organize a council to provide consultations. The council will gather giants in the grain industry and experts in agricultural transportation and sales to serve as councilors. The Bureau is currently considering the candidates for councilors. Once a decision is made, it will seek their consent separately and then announce the establishment, so that it can have more contacts with all parties in future business.

### Investment in Sichuan Province Banking Sector Already Approved

Lu Zuofu Returns to Sichuan After Visiting Beijing

According to banking circles here, Lu Zuofu, Director of the Construction Department of the Sichuan Provincial Government, came to Shanghai from Sichuan at the end of last year to negotiate with Shanghai banking circles about organizing a syndicate to invest in Sichuan. He visited leaders of major banks to discuss everything. The bank leaders, considering the great importance of financial adjustment in the interior and its close relationship with the banking industry itself, decided to transfer capital such as investment in real estate and foreign exchange to the interior to adjust rural finance. Therefore, although the results of Lu's visit were not fully achieved, considerable progress was made. In principle, the authorities of major banks expressed great sympathy for investing in Sichuan. However, due to the importance of the matter, careful deliberation and decision-making methods were required before proceeding. Lu himself, considering the task of this trip completed, went to Beijing on the 7th to meet with the authorities, report on the construction matters of Sichuan Province, and then took a China Aviation mail plane from Beijing back to Sichuan.

### Observatory Earthquake Instrument Recorded Strong Earthquake the Night Before

The English-language "China Press" reported that it received a telegram from London this morning (8th), stating that the seismographs at European observatories all indicated an earthquake, likely located in Central Asia. Details are requested. The Xujiahui Observatory was unaware of this telegram today, and no one else in Shanghai knew about it.

Its location was approximately 2,211 kilometers southwest of Shanghai, likely near the Tibetan border.

### Workers at Japanese-owned Asia Steel Weaving Factory Resumed Work Yesterday Morning

The factory has agreed to appropriately increase wages.

"Ta Kung Pao" reports that all the workers at the Japanese-owned Asia Steel Weaving Factory at 379 Hejian Road, Yangshupu Road, Shanghai, went on strike on the morning of the 5th, protesting the factory's refusal to increase their wages, hoping to awaken the factory's awareness. Since the workers' strike, all work in the factory has been suspended. After consultation between the factory manager and the foremen, the workers were promised a reasonable wage increase, hoping that the workers would resume work first. The workers resumed work in the factory as usual yesterday morning, as their goal was achieved. The Chinese and Japanese detectives sent by the police were also withdrawn.

### American Shipping Strike Shows Signs of Resolution

Sino-American Trade Greatly Affected

"The Continental Times" reports that American merchants here believe that the protracted American shipping strike is about to be resolved. According to telegraphic dispatches from the American private sector, labor and management are in negotiations and are about to reach an agreement. The extent to which Shanghai's commerce has been affected by this strike cannot be determined at this time. However, because Sino-American trade usually accounts for about a quarter of China's foreign commerce, the losses suffered by Shanghai must be substantial. In November of last year, goods imported from America totaled 16,903,869 yuan, and goods exported to America totaled 12,793,404 yuan. Sino-American trade totaled over 31 million yuan. Major American products such as raw cotton, steel, machinery and hardware products, vehicles, and lumber suffered the most. The losses suffered by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai who ship goods to America are almost equal to those of importers. Raw hides and plant products have been greatly affected because they cannot be loaded and unloaded in the United States. The American Commercial Counselor in China, Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Ho of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai both telegraphed the relevant departments of their country on New Year's Eve last year about the situation of Shanghai's suffering.

### Japanese Embassy Counselor Wosugi to Return to Japan

Japanese officials and civilians in Shanghai also held a farewell party at the Japanese Club before Wosugi's departure.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Deputy Manager Tan Boying Submits Resignation

Central News Agency reports that Mr. Tan Boying, Deputy Manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, recently resigned to the Ministry of Transportation. After hearing the news, the reporter immediately inquired in all directions. It is understood that the Ministry of Transportation had previously sent Cai Zengying as General Manager and Lian Boying as Deputy Manager to thoroughly reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which had been poorly managed, to benefit shipping. Deputy Manager Tan Boying is a German-trained mechanical expert with considerable experience in shipping and a meticulous approach to work. Therefore, since his arrival, he has adopted scientific management methods and designed many of the latest style ocean-going vessels. Recently, he has been working hard to eliminate malpractices in warehouses and wharves and to rectify them. As a result, the various warehouse and wharf offices are quick and orderly, and there is absolutely no shortage of goods, which is greatly welcomed by customers. His impartiality and selflessness are greatly admired by all parties. However, Tan has felt difficulties in his work since taking office. Although he has been very tolerant and hardworking, the results have not been satisfactory. Fearing that this would fail to meet the Ministry's expectations, he went to Beijing on the 5th of this month, after the completion of the warehouse and wharf reorganization, and submitted his resignation to Minister Yu. Although he was persuaded to stay, Tan was determined to leave and has submitted a written resignation after returning to the Bureau, resigning from the positions of Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Director of the Warehouse Management Office, and instructing all staff to continue to work hard and fulfill their duties. At the same time, he also ordered the various warehouse offices to rush to prepare transfer inventories so that the transfer and unloading can be carried out as soon as the Ministry approves it. It is reported that Tan returned to the Municipal Ferry Management Office yesterday to work.

### Shen Xin Labor Union Mediation - Shen Xin No. 8 Factory Resumes Work Last Night

Labor and management agree on four measures; further negotiation on the conditions proposed by the labor side.

The workers in the reeling and spinning departments of Shen Xin Textile Company's No. 8 Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, went on strike due to objections to the factory's wages and disregard for work records. After the Shanghai City Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union representatives persuaded them all night, they finally resumed work at 1:30 AM the night before. The details are as follows:

All-Night Persuasion

After the reeling and spinning departments of No. 8 Factory experienced another strike, the authorities feared that the dispute would escalate and involve other departments. Therefore, the Shanghai City Party Headquarters sent Lu Yinchu, a cadre of the People's Movement Section, and Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the General Labor Union, to Zhoujiaqiao overnight to jointly persuade both labor and management to prevent the dispute from escalating. The matter was resolved until after 1:00 AM late at night.

Resolution Measures

The Shanghai City Party Headquarters and General Labor Union mediated and resolved the following four measures: (1) Starting from February 15th, wages will be clearly written on the work record. (2) The work hours of the fine spinning department on Sundays shall not exceed 9:00 AM the next morning. (3) Workers who are replaced or stopped shall be assigned work as soon as possible to avoid long waits. (4) The sweeper in the reeling department will be hired by the factory at its own expense; each worker will sweep within his or her own section. As for the six conditions, such as rewarding work, proposed separately by the labor side, the workers will report to the Cotton Spinning Union of the Tenth District and then submit them to the Shanghai City Party Headquarters and General Labor Union for negotiation and resolution with the factory.

Full Resumption of Work

The workers in each department expressed satisfaction with the resolution measures and resumed work. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, all the workers in the night shift reeling and spinning departments resumed work as usual, maintaining good order. More than 30 policemen stationed in the factory for protection were withdrawn after the workers resumed work.

### Housing Tax Should Be Levied Based on Rent

Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council

The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday stating: "We have received a letter from the No. 24 branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association stating that Chen Yongzhong, owner of Shuntaixing at 456 Beijing Road, was not being assessed the general tax based on rent by the Donation Office. We had previously written to your Council requesting that this be rectified. Now, the Donation Office has written to our members, asking them to bring the above-mentioned documents and Chen's outline. However, the Bureau still insists on 240 yuan as the standard and refuses to reduce the quarterly tax, resulting in no resolution. Our members leased these houses for the purpose of revitalizing the market and because the number of unemployed workers has increased sharply and their livelihoods are precarious. They leased the houses, which had been empty for a long time, to set up shops. This was intended to alleviate the above two points and was not intended to generate large profits. Otherwise, the example of Ni Jinfeng's original house at 425 Tonglu Road, which has been empty for many years and has no tenants, can serve as a warning. To whom should the tax on such vacant houses be collected? The Bureau has always been known for its civilization, and its staff are purely intellectuals and should be empathetic to the current difficult times and accommodate requests. However, they do not take this into account and forcibly increase the tax, willingly violating the reputation of civilized people, which is a pity. Our Association, with a fair stance, believes that such insatiable and harsh collection by the Bureau is abnormal. We are writing again, hoping that you will investigate and continue to write to the Donation Office, urging it to realize that the general tax should be levied according to the rent stipulated in the lease contract to show fairness and relief to merchants in difficulty. We are deeply grateful for your fairness. We are writing to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, urging it to broaden its vision and not use policies that will exhaust the tax base."

### Dr. Niishiro Calculates Confucius' Birthday

Not August 27th, but October 3rd; Will Submit Request to the Chinese Government for Correction

The Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily" reports that world historians have doubts about the birthday of Confucius. Although the Chinese government has set it on August 27th, it is still difficult to determine the date from a historical perspective. Dr. Niishiro, of the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences, suddenly discovered the correct date: the birthday of the sage has been said to be the 21st year of Duke Xiang of Lu (552 BC) and the 22nd year of Duke Xiang (551 BC). It has also been said that he was born in October or November. The date of his death has been said to be April Yichou in the 16th year of Duke Ai (479 BC) or May Yichou. Scholars of the past have debated endlessly and have been unable to determine the exact date. Dr. Niishiro, after years of research, has determined that Confucius' birthday was the 21st day of the tenth month, Gengzi, of the 21st year of Duke Xiang of Lu." He said that this day, calculated according to the current solar calendar, is October 3, 552 BC. According to the "Spring and Autumn Continued Classics" and "Zuo Zhuan," he lived to the age of 74 on the 11th day of April Yichou of the 16th year of Duke Ai of Lu, which, calculated by the solar calendar, is March 4, 479 BC, which is more than a month away from August 27th, which is currently set by the National Government. According to Dr. Niishiro, the research is based on the "Zuo Zhuan," "Gongyang Zhuan," "Gu Liang Zhuan," "Records of the Grand Historian," "Shi Ben" and other documents. The "Zuo Zhuan," "Gongyang Zhuan," and "Gu Liang Zhuan" all say that he was born in the year Gengzi, the twenty-first year of Duke Xiang. And "Shi Ben" and "Records of the Grand Historian" all say the year Gengzi of the twenty-second year. If the day is Gengzi, then regardless of the twenty-first or twenty-second year, the month must be October. The November of Gongyang Zhuan is not Gengzi, but October Gengzi. As for the year of birth, Gongyang and Gu Liang are both the twenty-first year. If we quote Confucius’ commentary on Xiangong in Zuo Fu's thirty-first year, then Jian Da’s saying that Xiangong died in the twenty-first year is mathematically contradictory. Because if it was born in the twenty-first year of Xiangong (552 BC), then in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai (479 BC), he was 74 years old, not 73 years old. Du Yu’s twenty-first year of Xiangong and Xiangong’s sixteenth year records the twenty-second year. However, in Zhaogong's seventh year, Zhaogong said that Confucius was 35 years old in the twenty-fourth year and 28 years old in the seventeenth year of Zhaogong (525 BC), all of which are mathematically contradictory with the twenty-first year of Xiangong. Those who passed it as the twenty-second year based it on Shiji Shiben, but the book Shiben is unreliable, so after detailed research on astronomy and calendar numbers, there is no doubt that it is October 3. During Niishiro's research, he expressed his opinion eight years ago. After that, he continued his research and concluded that it was indeed correct. He will soon submit a request to the Nanjing National Government for correction.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Handling Ocean Transportation

In order to manage China's ocean cargo movement and transit business, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has established an Ocean Shipping Office at 133 Yuanmingyuan Road in Shanghai and has established agencies in major commercial ports overseas for handling matters. In order to clarify the purpose of the Ocean Shipping Office organization to the Shanghai shipping industry, the company invited representatives of Chinese and foreign shipping merchants at the office on December 29th to hold a discussion meeting. Zeng Guangqing, the resident of the Business Section of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, reported that the motive for establishing the Ocean Shipping Office was to implement the resolution of the Executive Yuan on July 3, 1936. The resolution stipulated that all military and political agencies of China's central, provincial, and municipal governments should entrust the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to handle the transportation of goods and materials ordered from foreign countries. Therefore, the purpose of the association is to make the shipping merchants understand the business operated by the office and to hope that the shipping merchant representatives will cooperate and provide practical assistance to achieve the government's wishes. It is also reported that the Ocean Shipping Office also handles the transportation of goods and materials exported from China.

### Winner of Thousand-Yuan Prize from Empty Bag of Invincible Tooth Powder

Inside the bottle of Butterfly Cream Toothpaste produced by the Home Industry Society, there was a small glass tube containing a huge amount of prize money, which was discovered in Lanzhou in January of last year. In order to promote the interest of domestic goods, the company issued empty boxes of Butterfly Cream Toothpaste and empty bags of tooth powder to exchange for prize tickets. The first prize was 1,000 yuan. The first period of prize tickets was drawn in public on December 31st of last year. The first prize was 194744. It was found that the prize ticket was given out by Guangchang Store on Tianzhutang Street in Shanghai. In a few days, the winner, Mr. Lin Tianxiang, went to redeem it. Mr. Lin is from Yongding County, Fujian Province, and is an apprentice at the Gonghexing Cigarette Shop on Xin Kaihe Road in Shanghai. He has been working in the store for more than a year and usually likes to use Invincible brand products. This time, he only used ten empty bags of Invincible brand tooth powder to exchange for prize tickets at Guangchang Store on Tianzhutang Street and won the first prize. He was overjoyed and has now received a bank check for 1,000 yuan in national currency from the company. It is learned that Mr. Lin, in addition to his store work, loves art. He said that he will deposit part of the prize money in the Gonghexing Cigarette Shop and support his parents, and part of it will be used to study art in order to pursue further studies.

### Cereals and Grains Exchange Announces Cancellation of Price Limit

The Shanghai Cereals, Grains, Oil and Soybean Cake Exchange announced the cancellation of the price limit due to the gradual shrinking of market prices. The original text stated: "The case of limiting the price increase and decrease of various commodities in the market by the previous session of this office is hereby cancelled from today. This is hereby announced." At the same time, it was also announced: "The prices of various commodities for buying and selling public bonds in December of last year are as follows: wheat 6.7 yuan per dan, Che Huang soybeans 4.586 yuan per dan, soybean oil 23.9 yuan per dan. If there are differences in the amount of cash delivered in this delivery, it should be calculated according to the above prices. This is hereby announced."

### Did Not Deny Descendant, Why Unnecessarily Litigate

Li Genfa, a local resident residing at No. 6 Tangjiabang, Pudong, 28 years old, filed a lawsuit in the local court against his grandmother Li Huang (70 years old, residing at No. 1, Lane 16, Renji Road, Lannidu) seeking confirmation of their relationship as descendant and grandmother. The lawsuit stated that Li Changshou, the grandmother's late husband, had no descendants and therefore adopted the plaintiff's father, Mao Mao, as his adopted son in June of the 27th year of the Guangxu reign. When Changshou passed away in the 10th year of the Republic of China, Mao Mao observed the rituals of mourning. Mao Mao also passed away in September of the 11th year of the Republic of China, and all the expenses were borne by the plaintiff. (However, the defendant, now advanced in years, was instigated by others, blinded by greed, and attempted to infringe upon the plaintiff's status, disregarding the dependence of ancestral spirits on offerings and sacrifices.) Yesterday, Judge Wang Run held a court session. Neither party was present; instead, lawyers represented them. After the plaintiff's lawyer, Qu Zheng, stated the case, the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Feitai, stated that after the death of the defendant's husband, Li Changshou, Li Mao Mao acquired his identity, and now the plaintiff is the descendant, and no one disputes this, so there is no need to sue. The judge then said to the plaintiff's lawyer, "Since there is no dispute, there is no problem." The plaintiff's lawyer said, "There is a reason for filing the lawsuit." The judge said that there was no need to litigate any further, and an amicable settlement was recorded in court, with the plaintiff bearing the litigation costs. A lawsuit that came out of nowhere thus came to an end.

### Pudong Lannidu Fire Pudong Lannidu Fire

Cigarette Paper Shop and Soy Sauce Shop Catch Fire One After Another, Suspicious Circumstances Surround Soy Sauce Shop's Tightly Closed Doors

At half past midnight the day before yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the F茂 Cigarette Paper Shop at the intersection of Jiangjia Alley on Lannidu Police Station Road in Pudong. At that late hour, when everything was quiet, nearby residents were awakened from their sleep. Upon seeing the flames engulfing the roof of the shop, they were terrified. In addition to the cold weather, everyone was trembling with fear. Cries filled the air as people scrambled to rescue their belongings, blocking the roads. The Pudong Branch Bureau and the Yangjing District Defense Corps dispatched police and guards to the scene to maintain order, which improved slightly. As the fire at the cigarette paper shop subsided, the adjacent Song Sheng Soy Sauce Shop caught fire, burning even more fiercely. By then, the Pudong District Fire Department had dispatched fire engines to the scene. Fire engines from Laobaidu and Yangjing District arrived shortly after. Because the Song Sheng Soy Sauce Shop's doors were tightly closed, it was impossible to extinguish the fire. As a result, the flames grew even larger, reaching high into the sky. Even ten miles away, the red glow in the sky could be seen, showing how intense the fire was. Half an hour later, the bungalow opposite the fire and the building in the Soy Sauce Shop Alley to the east were successively engulfed in flames. Firefighters concentrated their efforts to extinguish the flames. It was not until three o'clock yesterday morning that the fire was gradually brought under control. However, embers remained smoldering inside the fire area. From ten o'clock yesterday morning to two o'clock in the afternoon, despite the heavy rain, the fire rekindled twice, exhausting the firefighters. In total, two buildings of the F茂 shop, one workshop, two bungalows of the Song Sheng shop, three buildings in Soy Sauce Shop Alley, one Zhao Xinji clothing store, one Yang Tongxing cotton shop, and one Yang Kunshan barber shop were destroyed. In total, six buildings and five bungalows were destroyed. The total amount of the loss is still difficult to determine. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. However, nearby residents pointed out that the F茂 company had jointly insured 5,600 yuan of fire insurance with the Xiangtai Insurance Company and the Weilie Insurance Company. The Song Sheng Soy Sauce Shop had insured 6,000 yuan alone. The fact that firefighters could not force open the tightly closed doors of the Song Sheng Soy Sauce Shop led to speculation and dissatisfaction with both shops. Zhang Mingqin, head of the Pudong Police Branch Bureau, believing the loss to be significant, ordered Fan Dongyuan, the Ningbo manager of the F茂 company, to be brought to the bureau for questioning to investigate the truth about the fire. Recognizing the need for further investigation, he ordered him to be sent to the General Bureau for review yesterday afternoon.

### Assassin of Tang Youren Has Confessed

But Asks Court to Show Leniency

Tang Youren, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, was shot and killed by thugs in front of his private residence on Gansidong Road in the French Concession on December 25th of the year before last (24th year of the Republic). After the authorities offered rewards for the arrest of the perpetrators, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police successively captured the actual gunmen in the case, Liu Zhennan and Qiu Jiyu. Because the incident occurred in the French Concession, the French Concession Police dispatched detectives to bring the two suspects back and send them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. After several interrogations, the French Concession Police Department stated that the investigation procedures in this case were quite complicated and time-consuming, so they repeatedly requested the court to extend the deadline. All these circumstances have been reported in this newspaper. Now, the French Concession Police Department has completed the investigation procedures in this case, such as the investigation report, the confessions of the two defendants, and the testimony of witnesses, as well as the files of the Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police. The details were complicated and were only completed the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Wang Gangxu, Chief of the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, along with clerk Gao Yanmao, presided over the first criminal court and brought the two defendants for further interrogation. The Police Department's lawyer, relying on Article 271 of the Criminal Law on murder, prosecuted Liu and Qiu and stated in detail the prior consultation and planning by the two defendants as confessed to the Police Department, as well as the details of how they carried out the assassination of Tang Youren and then escaped before being arrested. The court then interrogated Liu and Qiu based on this information, and both frankly confessed to conspiring to kill Tang Youren and admitted that they were driven by patriotism to kill the traitor. Finally, they both confessed that they regretted being exploited and committing this illegal act, and they begged the court to show leniency because they had elderly mothers and young siblings at home. The court also summoned witnesses such as Shan Jinbiao, the gatekeeper at No. 232 Gansidong Road. They also asked Liu and Qiu whether they would hire lawyers for their defense. Both defendants said that they could not afford to hire lawyers, that they had already confessed to the crime, and only asked the court to show leniency. Chief Judge Wang reviewed the confession and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 19th to appoint defense lawyers for further questioning. The defendants were then taken into custody.

### Notorious Thieves Arrested in Liangxi Hotel

Handguns and Bullets Confiscated

Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the Public Concession Police Headquarters, recently learned that several bandits were hiding in Room 21 of the Liangxi Hotel at No. 144 Hubei Road, possessing dangerous weapons and plotting illegal activities. Therefore, at 3:20 p.m. the day before yesterday, he led Detective Wang Chengying, Detective Wang Jinsheng, and others fully armed to arrest them. Huang Hongsheng, also known as Wang Bin, Huang Kai, and Huang Jinling, 33 years old, from Ningbo, residing somewhere in the Southern City, and Song Genfa, also known as Gongfa, 28 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 286 Hed Road, were arrested in Room 21 of the hotel. An Austrian-style handgun, seven bullets, a magazine, and a bomb were confiscated and taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, explained the circumstances of the arrest and stated that because they still needed to arrest accomplices and investigate the crime, he requested permission to detain them for a week for further interrogation. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report and questioned the two suspects, and then ordered them to be remanded to custody and the hearing adjourned for a week for further review.

### Wife Sues Wang Naiwu for Adultery After He Takes a Concubine

Wang Naiwu, from Chuansha, also known as Wang Zulan, 42 years old, previously married a woman named Xi Taolin from the same village. Xi is 39 years old and has two sons. They live together at No. 3 Anfeng Li, Julai Da Road, in the French Concession. Wang is a partner in a bookstore at No. 26 Shandong Road. Recently, Wang's wife, Xi, learned that her husband, Wang Naiwu, was having an affair and had built a "golden house" on the third floor of No. 29 Zhenhua Li, Malang Road. Therefore, the night before last, she reported to the French Concession Police, who dispatched Detective Xu Jintang to the location and arrested Wang and his mistress, Zhang Jubao (21 years old, from Lili, Wujiang), and took them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhu Chuzhe interrogated them. The Police Department lawyer, Yao Zhao Di, explained the case and prosecuted them for adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. Then, the plaintiff, Wang's wife Xi, stated the circumstances, saying that after her husband had an affair, he often came home and beat her, causing her to be injured and vomit blood. Now, she found out that her husband and the second defendant were committing adultery, rented a house, and lived together, so she requested that they be severely punished according to the law. Wang Naiwu confessed that as a merchant doing bookstore business, he often went to other ports to promote sales. In March of last year, he went to Lili Town and, to seek emotional comfort, asked a friend to introduce him to Zhang Jubao as a concubine. At that time, he paid 300 yuan in betrothal money and brought her to Shanghai. First, he asked his wife to live with her, but she refused, so he rented another house to live separately. However, his relationship with his wife was outwardly harmonious, but his younger brother stirred up trouble and caused him to suffer greatly emotionally. This has been mediated by friends, which can be proven. Zhang Jubao said that she married Wang as a concubine, which can be proven, and that she was not just having an affair. She did not know that Wang had a wife until October of this year. If Wang Naiwu does not want her as a concubine, he must pay her alimony for life. Then, witnesses Zhu Linsheng and Shen Yucheng testified that they had mediated between Wang and his wife, because Wang's property was managed by Xi, and they advised Xi to pay Wang Naiwu 40 yuan a month for expenses, but Xi did not agree to the concubine living with them. The court reviewed the confessions and stated that the case was clear and should be concluded after arguments. The sentencing was scheduled for the 15th. The two defendants were released on bail, and the two parties were told that they could try to reach a settlement outside of court.

### Nanjing Downstream Seven Miles, Haiyi and Qingning Collide

Qingning Severely Damaged, Runs Aground, Both Sides Send Representatives for Inspection

The Qingning of the Shanghai Hwaning Shipping Company, weighing 1951 tons, 275 feet in length, 36 feet and 2 inches in width, 21 feet and 5 inches in depth, 17 feet and 3 inches in draft, and a speed of 9 knots per hour, was sailing from Shanghai to Huangshigang in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to load coal. At 6:14 p.m. on the 7th, when it was nearly seven miles downstream from Nanjing, it was already dark and snowing, making navigation on the misty river more difficult. At this time, the Haiyi of the Shanghai Huashang Shipping Company, weighing 3154 tons, 331 feet and 8 inches in length, 43 feet in width, 24 feet and 9 inches in depth, 20 feet and 2 inches in draft, and a speed of 11 knots per hour, was carrying coal from Huainan downstream to Shanghai. After passing Nanjing, when it was near the Qingning, the river surface was obscured by snowflakes, and neither side could see each other. When they got closer, the two ships were directly heading towards each other on a straight line. Although they wanted to avoid each other, it was too late. The Qingning was hit head-on by the Haiyi, causing the left side of the Qingning's bow to be damaged. The first and second holds immediately ruptured and were pierced, and river water rushed in. Seeing that the front half of the ship was about to sink after water entered the first two holds, the shipowner urgently sped to the riverbank to run aground to avoid sinking. After the accident, the shipowner immediately telegraphed Shanghai, saying, "The Qingning was hit by the Haiyi ship seven miles downstream from Nanjing at 6:14 p.m. on the 7th. The left side of the bow is leaking badly, and the damage is severe. Measures have been taken to run aground to ensure safety." However, when the ship ran aground, because the speed was too high, it hit a sailboat, which was damaged by the Qingning. The Haiyi was also damaged in the bow compartment, but it did not affect navigation. The ship has now sailed downstream to Shanghai and will unload the cargo and enter the dock for repairs. Hwaning Company reported the incident to the China United Ship Insurance Association yesterday. In order to understand the actual situation, Xu Zufan and Qingning shipowner Zhuang Huibo were dispatched to Nanjing on the same night to inspect the damage to the Qingning and the circumstances of the collision and to determine rescue measures.

### Young Woman Shen Lijuan Sues Husband for Bigamy

Found to Be True After Interrogation, Defendant Released on Bail

Shen Lijuan, a young woman from Suzhou, 22 years old, sued Ni Lusheng, a silk broker from Liuzhaowan, Nanhui, 32 years old, in the local court for fraudulent marriage and bigamy. Yesterday, Judge Yu Lude held a court session to hear the case. Shen Lijuan stated that her mother's family lived on Yongxing Road, Zhabei. At the age of 19, on October 16th, she officially married Ni Lusheng through a matchmaker in Xicangqiao. Although she did not sit in a sedan chair, she rode in a decorated car. At that time, he said that he had no wife. But in March of last year, when she returned to her hometown to sweep the tombs, she discovered that the defendant had a wife, so she sued him for bigamy. The defendant, Ni Lusheng, stated that the marriage took place on October 16th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The matchmakers were Lao Jin, Gu Zhongqing, Chen Erjie, and Laitou, but they were not officially married. Because his first wife had no children, he wanted to have an heir. The judge asked if they had worshiped heaven and earth. He replied, "We worshiped the Kitchen God, and I also paid respects to his father." The judge said, "In that case, it is undoubtedly an official marriage." He replied, "The one I have at home now is a second wife, and she has lung disease." The judge said, "Since you already had a wife, why did you marry her, and why did you lie that you had no wife?" He replied, "I explained it beforehand, and her godfather knew about it too. I paid 300 yuan in betrothal gifts." At this point, the judge asked Shen Lijuan about her relationship with Ni. She replied, "It's very ordinary, and he often beats and scolds me and doesn't give me money. When we got married, I only received 240 yuan of the betrothal gifts." At this point, the judge announced an adjournment for further questioning. The defendant was released on bail of 300 yuan.

### Married Woman Adultery Case Adjudicated Yesterday

Adulterer and Adulteress Sentenced to Three Months Each, Fined 60 Yuan for Opium

Ding Shanming, a local resident, 28 years old, formerly graduated from the Literature Department of Jinan University. He opened Yilong Rice Shop in Hongqiao Town, Xujiahui. On March 11th of the 16th year of the Republic of China, he married Gu Cuizhen (29 years old), the niece of Gu Xiaoyan, a village elder in Hongqiao Town, and lived together at No. 25 Henan, Hongqiao Town. Recently, Ding Shanming learned that his wife was having an affair with Cao Zhongfu, a local real estate businessman residing at No. 45 Yidingpan Road, and they were meeting at Room 374 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. He reported this to the Laozha Police, who ordered detective Ye Yuxi to go to the Oriental Hotel and arrest Cao Zhongfu and Ding Gu. Fifty-three small pieces of opium and a licensed handgun were seized and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo presided over the second criminal court to continue the hearing of the case. The defendants jointly hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yan Yinwu to appear in court and stated, "According to our lawyers, the plaintiff Ding Shanming intends to withdraw the charges against the defendant Ding Gu in this case. We request that this be inquired about first." Ding Shanming then stated that he must pursue the matter against both defendants and that he had no intention of withdrawing the charges. He also stated that the defendant Cao Zhongfu was his friend, and he had often seen him when he went to his wife's house. Witness Pan Ding stated, "Ding Shanming is my younger brother, and he has been married to Ding Gu for nine years. My brother has not taken a concubine or driven my sister-in-law Ding Gu out." Cao Zhongfu stated, "Gu Xiaoyan (deceased), the uncle of Ding Gu, was formerly my teacher, so I have known Ding Gu for more than ten years. But the relationship only started two years ago. I did not know that she was married. She often visited me at Puai Fang, Wuma Road, so we committed adultery." Ding Gu stated, "Cao Zhongfu was my late uncle's student. We met when he was studying. I married Ding Shanming at the age of 20. Two years later, my husband took a concubine and drove me out, causing me to live at my mother's house for seven years. He ignored my daily life and abandoned me. Therefore, I voluntarily followed Cao. In fact, Cao Zhongfu did not know that I had a husband. The opium seized by the police was purchased by Cao on my behalf because I had a stomach problem." Ding Shanming hired lawyer Gong Wenhuan to appear in court and filed a civil suit requesting that the two defendants jointly compensate him for losses of 385 yuan. After arguments between the police lawyer Jiang Baolian and the defendant's lawyer, Judge Dai ruled that Ding Gu committed adultery while married and was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Cao Zhongfu committed adultery with a married person and was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. For possessing opium, he was fined 60 yuan. If the two defendants chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, one yuan would be equivalent to one day.

### British-Owned Public Bus Workers Oppose Lowering Year-End Bonus

Demand That It Still Be Issued According to Previous Regulations

Dagong News reports that the British-owned China General Omnibus Company in the Public Concession has a customary practice of giving each worker a year-end bonus of one month's salary at the end of the lunar year to reward them. Now, the company has announced that it will cancel the old year-end bonus system and change it to 5% of the total annual salary. All the company's workers believe that this measure by the company reduces their original treatment by as much as 40%, so they are generally dissatisfied. The Drivers' Mutual Aid Association and the Ticket Sellers' Welfare Association have jointly requested the company to continue to handle matters according to the old regulations, but the company has not yet given a concrete reply.

### Dim Night Causes Fish Vendor Truck to Overturn, Hitting Electric Pole

Eleven Fish Vendors Severely Injured, Man in Free Car in Critical Condition

Near the Ziqiupu Road Waterworks in Yangshupu, at around 3:40 a.m. yesterday, a fish vendor truck was traveling from Limma Road in the 16th Shed to the fish market to pick up goods. It was unexpected that the truck driver, driving through the area at night, did not have good visibility, and he was driving too fast. Due to carelessness, the truck crashed into an electric pole on the side of Ziqiupu Road, causing the entire truck to overturn. All the vendors on the truck were thrown more than ten feet away. The front of the truck was also badly damaged. At the same time, a man riding a free car happened to be passing by and was run over by the truck, immediately falling unconscious. Fortunately, after the accident, the police officers on duty heard about it and rushed to the scene. They saw more than ten fish vendors lying on the ground with serious injuries, moaning and screaming in pain. They urgently telegraphed the fire department to urgently call an ambulance to rush to the scene and fly the injured to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment.

### 93-Year-Old British Woman Passes Away

Mrs. Thiselton, Children Scattered Around the World

The North China Daily News reports that Mrs. Thiselton, a British woman, passed away on Thursday at her residence at No. 16 Yidingpan Road in this city, at the age of 93. Although Mrs. Thiselton was not the oldest foreign woman in China, it is believed that she was the oldest foreigner in Shanghai. Mrs. Thiselton was still healthy until recently. On September 22nd of last year, when she celebrated her 93rd birthday, representatives of her children and grandchildren gathered around her, filling the room. She was happy to see them. In her youth, Mrs. Thiselton was very active. Until a few years ago, she was often seen at the Shanghai Swimming Club, the French Club, and playing golf on the racecourse. Mrs. Thiselton was particularly concerned about the affairs of the British Women's Association and was a devout believer, attending church regularly. A week before her death, she was still attending church and praying. In recent months, she often rolled bandages for the British Women's Association to pass the time. Although Mrs. Thiselton had to sit quietly at home all day because of her old age and give up her former hard work, she was still mindful of beneficial things in the world due to her active nature. One of Mrs. Thiselton's daughters married a German and recently came to Shanghai to visit her. A granddaughter lives in Shanghai with her husband and has three children. All of Mrs. Thiselton's children are still alive and live in different parts of the world. One son used to be a customs officer in China and is now living in England after retirement. One son lives in Canada, and another daughter also lives in England. Mrs. Thiselton went to Canada seven years ago to visit her son when she was nearly 90 years old.

### Landlords Should Immediately Report Tenants Smoking Opium

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau is very strict on the issue of banning drugs and opium in the city. Not only are those who manufacture, sell, and consume drugs punished by military law, but those who consume opium without a license are also handled by military law. Recently, the bureau issued instructions to its branches that if landlords or second landlords conceal and fail to report private opium dens or the sale of opium for consumption, they will be prosecuted for harboring criminals. Recently, Wang Fubao, a police officer from the City God Temple Police Station, reported that a private opium den was selling opium to unlicensed opium smokers at No. 16 Fuyou Li, Danfeng Road. Director Yu immediately sent household registration inspector Chen Shusheng to lead the police to arrest several opium smokers.

A few days ago, a fellow villager named Wei Siyou ordered 20,000 cigarette boxes, totaling more than 200 yuan. After the goods were picked up, Wei signed a check for 200 yuan from the Ken Ye Bank. When it was due, it was returned due to insufficient funds. Wang immediately looked for Wei, but he avoided him. It was obvious that he had issued a bad check. Yesterday, Wang passed by Minguo Road and encountered Wei Siyou. He immediately called policeman Wu Hengchang to take him to the City God Temple Police Station. After interrogation, it was found that the case involved using a bad check to defraud goods. He was sent to the General Bureau to be dealt with according to the law.

### Review of the Completion of the Dharma Treasure Library by Buddhist Scholars

Set to Hold Completion Ceremony Next Month; Di Chuqing Donates Song and Yuan Buddhist Statues

The Buddhist Pure Land Society at No. 418 Hartung Road in this city, considering the scarcity of Buddhist libraries in the country, which hinders scholars of Sanskrit scriptures due to the lack of resources for review, initiated the construction of a large-scale Buddhist library in the Jueyuan of Hart Road, naming it "Dharma Treasure," as previously reported. The construction of the library has now been completed and a completion ceremony will be held soon. Details are as follows:

Construction Project

The Dharma Treasure Library is located in Jueyuan on Hart Road, covering an area approximately 40 feet wide and 70 feet deep. It is entirely constructed of steel and concrete, divided into three floors. The second floor houses the scripture section, and the third floor the Dharma object section. The library is surrounded by lush flowers and trees, creating a pleasant garden setting. The construction began in the summer of last year and has now been completed.

Completion Next Month

Regarding construction expenses, in addition to the generous donation of 10,000 taels (over 14,000 national currency yuan) from the former Minister of Transportation, Ye Gongchuo, the remaining funds were allocated from the public reserve fund of the Buddhist Pure Land Society. The completion ceremony is scheduled for mid-February of this year, with donations of Song and Yuan Buddhist statues and famous books from prominent figures such as Di Chuqing, including images of the three sages, Manjushri, and the Ming Dynasty Hongwu and Yongle imperial editions of the Tripitaka.

### Ho Shunen's Lawsuit to Recover Antiques Dismissed

Nie Junwei Acquitted

Nie Junwei, the brother of the former Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Nie Yuntai, had four antique porcelain pieces deposited with his cousin, He Songwen, in the first year of the Republic. Now, more than twenty years later, He has passed away. He's son, Shunen, recently found a receipt written by Nie acknowledging the receipt of the four pieces, and demanded their return from Nie, without success. He then engaged lawyer Yuan Yangan to file a criminal lawsuit for embezzlement in the First Special District Court. Nie raised the issue of the statute of limitations, arguing that the plaintiff's lawsuit was time-barred and requesting a dismissal. After final arguments, Judge Pan Zhenyang, presiding over the case, announced the verdict in the Fifth Tribunal yesterday afternoon, acquitting Nie Junwei and dismissing the plaintiff's related civil suit.

### Shareholders of Jiuyi Hosiery Factory Sue Manager

Zhang Ziliang, a shareholder of the closed Jiuyi Hosiery Factory, previously filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District Court against manager Wang Liwei for embezzlement. After Judge Wang of the Audit Court reviewed the case, he decided to postpone the hearing for further investigation, as reported previously. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court, first questioning Wang Liwei about various accounts. Wang replied that the amount of 10,359 yuan from the years of 1933 to 1935 was written off due to unpaid salaries and bonuses to merchants, as decided by the shareholders. There were other accounting issues that the merchant had not had time to thoroughly review. When asked if the accounting books had been handed over, Wang replied that all the books had been submitted to the accountant for auditing. At this point, lawyer Li Mo stated to the court that he now represented other shareholders, Zhu Xianqi, Chu Ganquan, Feng Jinzhang, Feng Canzhang, and thirteen other households, joining the lawsuit and demanding an additional civil suit for 39,909.90 yuan. The plaintiff, Zhang Ziliang, stated that the defendant had embezzled a total of over 65,000 yuan, and that he should be able to recover more than 6,500 yuan in his name. After reviewing the statements, Judge Wang decided to postpone the hearing to the afternoon of the 13th and summon the shareholders to court for further questioning.

### Wet Nurse Visiting Master's Illness Causes a Lawsuit

Inaccurate and Incomplete Content

Gu Yushan, a local resident of Haichao Road in the South City, is sixty years old and wealthy. His wife, Gu Xia, is also sixty-two years old. Thirty years ago, after giving birth to a child, they hired a wet nurse named Pan from Tongzhou (now fifty-two years old). At that time, Pan was in her prime, possessing the beauty of a young woman, and was favored by the master. Subsequently, she resided at No. 3, Lane 74, Xiaoputuo Bridge in the South City, and bore him a son and a daughter. Recently, Gu Yushan suffered from an abdominal tumor and was hospitalized for surgery. Pan, concerned, brought qiazi (a type of fruit), fruits, and snacks to the Gu residence to visit him. Gu Xia saw her and became extremely jealous, refusing her entry, leading to an argument. Pan became enraged and threw stone bricks, completely smashing bowls, dishes, and stools. The police were called, and each had their own reasons, leading to a lawsuit in court. Xia then engaged lawyer Xu Xingti in the local court, suing for obstruction of freedom and property damage, denying any relationship with her husband, and claiming to be seeking twenty years of back wages as a wet nurse. Yesterday, Judge Shao opened the court. Pan presented her version of events, stating that there was only a verbal argument and no damage to property. The judge decided to postpone the hearing for further investigation, requiring Gu Baoyou to testify in person.

### Japanese Drug Den Cracked Down on in Hainan Road

Eight Chinese Sitting Around Smoking Heroin; All Arrested and Sent to Hospital for Interrogation

Western Detective Vewu and Chinese Detective Guo Ruiquan of the Hongkou Police Station learned that a house at No. 53 Hainan Road was selling heroin and providing opium substitutes for profit. They sent an informant to purchase drugs and confirmed the information. However, the house was leased by a Japanese named Suzuki Jihei. At approximately 11 AM the day before yesterday, they coordinated with Japanese detectives from the Japanese Consulate and Chinese and Western police officers to raid the location. They found eight local residents, including Zhang Shangxian, Jiang Taisou from Zhenjiang, Jiang Taifu, Ma Xiaosanzi from Taizhou, Shen Zhongwu, Shen Genfu, Wang Laohu, and an elderly woman, Hua Laosan from Wuxi, sitting around a table smoking heroin. A servant, Wu Azhang, tore open two small packages of drugs and threw the paper on the ground. Zhang Shangxian and others were arrested. The main suspect, Japanese Suzuki Jihei, along with a total of 85 small packages of heroin, two small opium pipes, two small bamboo tubes, four cigarette lighter shells, two cigarette foil papers, and two candles, were taken to the police station. Suzuki Jihei was sent to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. The nine men and women, including Zhang Yanxian, were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhang Dayin, explained the case and requested public prosecution under Articles 8 and 16 of the Anti-Drug Law. He stated that, except for the defendant Wu Azhang, the others had confessed to smoking drugs at the police station. If any of the defendants changed their statements in court, he requested a postponement for a forensic examination by the court's medical examiner. Chinese and Western detectives then presented the evidence and described the process of solving the case. Zhang Shangxian, Jiang Taifu, Ma Xiaosanzi, and Shen Zhongwu all claimed to have been smoking for medical reasons, at a cost of twenty copper coins per small package. The others denied the charges, claiming to have been visiting friends. (It was discovered that Tu Laohu had been arrested for smoking heroin last May and sentenced to three years of imprisonment. He was later sent to a drug rehabilitation hospital and released.) Judge Zhong Qing ordered the defendants to be detained separately for further verification in seven days. Jiang Taisou, Shen Genfu, Wang Laohu, Wu Azhang, and the elderly woman Hua Laosan were sent to the court's forensic department for examination.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor: The letter published in your newspaper on the 8th, regarding the correction of "Iwo Line Deck Workers Oppose the Establishment of a Management Affairs Office," is inconsistent with the facts and is intended to shirk responsibility. We hereby provide a detailed account of the actual process and reasons, and request that it be published to correct the record. Sincerely, the Hoi An East Sea Boat Deck Workers of the Iwo Line. ㊀ The Law on the Organization of Seamen's Unions stipulates that the five departments of seamen refer to workers. Therefore, the organization of groups should also be based on workers as the basic unit. Now that the managers are organizing the Managers' Mutual Aid Society, the workers are afraid of being further oppressed and harmed in the future. Therefore, they petitioned the Seamen's Party Department and the union to prevent its establishment, which is fully in line with the Law on the Organization of Seamen's Unions. What is considered unreasonable? ㊁ The so-called "Managers' Mutual Aid Society invites Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Mr. Li Zubi to be the chairman and vice-chairman" is a selfish plot by a few active members among the managers, who used flowery words to deceptively invite Mr. Wang and Mr. Li to serve as chairman and vice-chairman without the consent of the workers. It is naturally a private group of managers. Now, the 100+ workers of the Hoi An Line, because they already have a group, the "Dong Yi Society," which is formally established and has achieved results, and the workers have benefited significantly. Therefore, they appointed representatives to petition the Seamen's Party Department and the union to stop issuing a license, as the Party Department and the union should handle the workers' movement, and should not issue a license according to the wishes of the workers. ㊂ Some boat managers are against the workers. For example, the manager of the new "Ping Wo" boat, Ma Yuting, unjustly fired worker Jiang Yongyao on the 6th of this month and hired a private seaman to supplement the work. Another example is the manager of the "Fu Sheng" boat, Yang Xianquan, who deducted worker Chen Qiusheng's salary by four yuan (the company stipulates a monthly salary of 18 yuan, but the manager deducted four yuan, only giving 14 yuan per month). There are countless such cases among the managers of the Hoi An boats, all of which can be investigated one by one. Is this not a fact? January 8, 1937.

To the Editor: After reviewing the report in your newspaper on the 7th of this month regarding the case of Ms. Lu Chen suing Zhou Yu and Lu Zhou Weizhen for assault, which was represented by our firm (i.e., the news report on the dispute between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and the involvement of both families), the content is inconsistent with the facts. We request that the following points be corrected: ㊀ During the court hearing that day, the defendant Zhou Weizhen did not say anything about thin or thick porridge. ㊁ The defendant Zhou Weizhen's return to her mother's house was of her own volition and was not sent back by our client and her son, De Sun. ㊂ At the end of last year, our client, Lu De Sun, filed a petition with the Second Special District Court to request mediation and to cohabitate with his wife, Weizhen, because his wife Weizhen had been living in her mother's house for a long time. Zhou Weizhen never filed a petition with the Second Special District Court to request separation. ㊃ Lu Chen was beaten by Zhou Yu's son on June 26th of last year, not on December 28th of last year as reported in the newspaper. ㊄ Both parties arrived at court on time for the mediation hearing. The mediation failed because Zhou Weizhen did not intend to cohabitate, not because "the other party did not arrive and the mediation failed" as reported in the newspaper. We hereby submit this letter for clarification and request that your newspaper grant a correction. Sincerely, Attorney Hu Yushi, January 8, 1937.

### A Study of Article 15 of the Income Tax Implementation Regulations

— Accountant Shen Liren

From the dawn of our nation's history until midnight on December 31, 1936, was a period without income tax (excluding partial levies and income donations, etc.). Starting from New Year's Day, 1937, various income taxes were fully implemented, marking a major reform in our nation's finances and economy. As this new tax is being implemented, people across the country are deeply concerned about its regulations, studying its implementation guidelines. Currently, there are two laws in our country regarding income tax: one is the Provisional Income Tax Law, comprising twenty-six articles, and the other is the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Income Tax Law, totaling forty-nine articles. The former is the fundamental law of income tax, providing a comprehensive overview, while the latter elaborates on its clauses, supplementing the shortcomings of the Implementation Regulations. The method of collection is described in detail in the Implementation Regulations. Although the collection of income tax is broadly divided into three categories: profit income, salary and remuneration income, and interest income, among the three, whether viewed from a numerical or economic perspective, the income of profit-making enterprises is the most extensive and complex, requiring the most research. Looking at the entire Income Tax Implementation Regulations, Article 15 is the most important regarding the income of profit-making enterprises. I would like to discuss the content of this article with fellow practitioners.

The original text of Article 15 is: "When calculating Category 1 income, the gross income should be reduced by the actual expenses incurred during the business period, bad debts, depreciation, inventory consumption, public levies, and legally stipulated reserve funds. The remaining amount is the net profit, which is taxed according to the tax rate stipulated in Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations." The word "actual" in this article is quite questionable. The common interpretation of "actual" is "real," but among the items listed in this article that should be deducted, besides expenses, public levies, and legally stipulated reserve funds, most of the other items are based on estimation. Even the item of expenses sometimes cannot obtain the actual amount. I will discuss each item in detail below.

㊀ Expenses: There are two types of calculation for expenses: the accrual basis (or the rights and responsibilities basis) and the cash basis (or the cash receipts and payments basis). Each industry can weigh the situation and decide for itself. The Company Law does not have any regulations. However, once one method is adopted, it cannot be changed arbitrarily. Because after deciding to adopt a certain system, if it is continuously applied, although there may be a sudden increase or decrease in the tax payable in the first year, it can still be compensated in the following years, and the final result will be the same. From an accounting theory perspective, the accrual basis is more reasonable for large-scale businesses. Now this article stipulates that the expenses must be "actual," which seems to mean the expenses actually paid. Those that have not been paid but have been consumed cannot be included.

㊁ Bad Debts: The so-called bad debts are not actually uncollectible debts. Generally, at the end of the accounting year, based on the collection situation, an estimated amount for "bad debt provision" is made. If interpreted literally as "actual bad debts," it must refer to debts that are truly uncollectible before they can be deducted from the gross income.

㊂ Depreciation: The meaning of depreciation has both theoretical and practical aspects. Actual depreciation can be illustrated by two examples. Suppose a car is purchased for six thousand yuan. After one year, if the car is sold for three thousand yuan, and after two years it can be sold for two thousand yuan, then the actual depreciation in the first year is three thousand yuan, and in the second year it is one thousand yuan. This is one example. Another example is that a roadside telephone pole can usually be used for ten years. Its function is the same from the first year to the ninth year. It is only in the last year that it is damaged and unusable. The actual depreciation must only occur in the tenth year, and there is no need for depreciation in the previous nine years. The calculation of depreciation in accounting is theoretical.

㊃ Inventory Consumption: The consumption of goods during inventory is the result of valuation, and there is no fixed standard. It cannot be called "actual." Since the promulgation of the Detailed Rules for Implementation, our office has often received inquiries regarding the ambiguities of this article. Now, I have selected a few of the more important questions and their answers, which are appended below.

㊀ Question: If a customer's debt has been written off as a bad debt but is suddenly recovered in the following year, how should this recovered amount be calculated to comply with the provisions of the Income Tax Regulations?

Answer: The so-called "compliance with the provisions of the Income Tax Regulations" in your question is not actually specified in the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Income Tax Law. However, based on the principles, if a bad debt that has been written off is recovered in the second year, it should be treated as a profit for the second year. Because it was written off in the first year, the profit must have decreased as a result, and the tax was also lower. After it is recovered in the second year, it should be included in the profit and re-paid for the tax that should be borne. However, this point is also related to the date of the implementation of income tax. If the bad debt was written off before the implementation of income tax, but was suddenly recovered after the implementation of income tax, this recovered amount should not be treated as a profit for the year it was received, because the law does not apply retroactively. Since the recovered amount belongs to before the implementation of income tax, it should not be taxed.

㊁ Question: Our small business has no provisions for depreciation. In the past, because business was booming, our owner wrote off a large amount of depreciation on various fixed assets. Now that we hear that income tax will be implemented soon, can we add the excessively amortized depreciation back into the assets?

Answer: This situation is common among businesses in our country that are thriving. However, after the implementation of income tax, profits will inevitably increase after large depreciations have been made in the past, and the tax will be high. Therefore, to reduce the burden of taxation, the over-provisioned depreciation should be transferred to assets to make a reasonable correction.

㊂ Question: In the past, our company intentionally underestimated the valuation of inventory in order to conceal profits, and there was a large difference between the valuation and the cost price. Is there any conflict between this valuation method and the collection of income tax?

Answer: The Provisional Income Tax Law and the Detailed Rules for Implementation do not specify the method of inventory valuation. Each industry has its own characteristics and can determine a standard based on the circumstances. However, once it is stipulated, it cannot be changed arbitrarily. If you want to change it, you must report it to the income tax authorities and explain the reasons.

(If any sectors have questions about various aspects of income tax in our country, they can write to the China Certified Public Accountants Office at 275 Gordon Road, Shanghai. We will answer them in detail to the best of our knowledge.)

### "The Suiyuan Front is Extremely Peaceful"

— Yunhai

Reading the newspaper on the 6th, I was shocked to see "The Suiyuan Front is Extremely Peaceful." The enemy has been plotting against us and their desires cannot be satisfied with the surrender of even an inch of land. Now, the front suddenly reports "peace." Could it be that "Ning Weng gets his horse," a precursor to disaster? Several years ago, I read Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front," and at the end, the Western Front officers reported "all quiet," but who knew that the soldiers on the front lines were dying from enemy bullets? The book emphasizes the cruelty of "war," but I heard a silent cry - we must not be optimistic about the superficial "peace," because the reality is still dangerous. If this statement has any truth, it is applicable now.

Under the headline "The Suiyuan Front is Peaceful" on the 6th, we see: "Enemy planes have not flown in the past four days, from the 2nd to the 5th. The situation in Honggeertu, Tumutai, and other places is unusually peaceful." Perhaps the soldiers fighting in the frozen, snowy fields have been too exhausted from the fierce battles of the past few days, so the enemy planes not attacking us is considered "peaceful" and allows them to rest a little. This is understandable, but the fear is that those of us in the rear will not observe the actual situation and will be satisfied with this comfortable state of "peace," and will excitedly set off firecrackers to celebrate victory, which would be falling for the enemy's trap.

Originally, in order to "eradicate" the scourge of war, we cannot be satisfied with "enemy planes have not flown in the past four days." Even if we take a step back and only think about "defense," we should consider the reason why the enemy planes are not coming - is it a cessation of aggression? Or is it a mobilization and replenishment of troops, preparing for a large-scale invasion after recuperating?

Regarding the right and wrong of these two questions, let us let the facts of these four days from "enemy planes have not flown in the past four days from the 2nd to the 5th" answer them.

Report from the 2nd: Wang Ying gathered the remnants of bandits and reorganized them into an army. The 3rd Brigade and a heavy artillery battalion are stationed in Shangdu Tunken Village. In addition, Li Shouxin's 6th Regiment, Bao Yueqing's 13th, 14th, and 15th Regiments, and the Yeshan Artillery 2nd Regiment are all gathered in Shangdu. Report from the 3rd: More than 2,000 troops of the puppet army Wang Jingxiu's command were dispatched from Duolun to Shangdu. Zhang Yizhe's (Zhang Haipeng's son) cavalry of more than 1,000 are harassing the people near Shangdu, with no discipline. Report from the 4th: The Kwantung Army's major regiment moved into Zhangbei County, and transported 100 tanks. The puppet army Yu Zhiyue's command of about 1,000 people today (4th) was dispatched from Duolun to Shangdu. The puppet army is currently building trench ladders, the airport is parked with 20 enemy planes and more than 30 armored vehicles, the deployment is tense, and they plan to attack the east of Suiyuan from Honggeertu and Tumutai. Report from the 5th: Zhangbei Shangdu has become an important base for a certain party to harass Suiyuan. Recently, a large amount of military supplies were transported from the hot area to Jiabu Temple, twice as much as before the failure, and distributed to various bandit departments in the front defense. Wang Ying and Li Shouxin were both recalled to Huade.

At the front lines, the enemy's mobilization and replenishment have fully demonstrated that "peace" is superficial. Moreover, in the New Year, the "friendly nation" also gave us two "precious gifts" (one is sending warships to the inland of the Yangtze River near Changshu and Taicang to survey the water level and shoot at the shore with heavy machine guns. The other is sending planes on the morning of the 2nd to fly over Qingdao's airspace to scatter five-colored flags and leaflets). These are also "conscious" actions!

This year is the "Year of the Ox." We should learn the ox's brute force spirit to eradicate the banditry, and we should not learn from the "Year of the Rat" to be timid and satisfied with the "superficial peace."

### The Peak

— Yulu

As soon as we entered the harbor, the first thing we saw was the very majestic "Peak," the backdrop of this southern port.

Most ships arrive at night, so the Peak makes an even more profound impression on the average traveler. A dark, towering shadow stands like a barrier before our eyes. If that huge shadow is like a demon, then it must be wearing a long robe shimmering with phosphorescence, with countless lights twinkling around the mountain, looking strangely lovely.

If it were daytime, then you could see this natural stronghold more clearly, with an aesthetic eye.

Hong Kong is a mountain island. Yes, it is indeed formed of mountains, and the Peak is the mother of Hong Kong. The metropolis of the British Empire's Pacific territory, famous throughout the world, is built at the foot of this mountain. Its terrain gives Hong Kong its very crucial position.

At the top of the mountain, as we saw in the daytime, flies the "Union Jack," boasting of ownership. The shadow sways in the wind, which is indeed a great comfort to those greedy rulers. The mountain is also very beautiful, and the villa-style houses built on the mountainside are like adding makeup to a beautiful young woman, adding a lot of charm; however, it is also because this majestic mountain compresses the houses on the hillside into a small peak. - People who are used to living in Hong Kong do not mention it much.

Of course, all artificial decorations are "intentional." A woman dresses up beautifully for her own reasons; the reason why the Peak is like this is not to intoxicate some holiday travelers from Europe? Every summer, these villa-style houses have their own customers, but there is a condition here, or rather a "harsh example," which is "no transactions with yellow-skinned Chinamen." This is a privilege given by God to the white rulers! (However, there are "exceptions" here. It is said that Comprador He X, who is almost naturalized, is "permitted" to build a house on the hillside.) I wonder if this "harsh example" or this "privilege" has been abolished now?

In addition to villas, there is also the "Peak Hotel" to entertain short-term travelers. Its nobility is just like its price, which is unimaginable for us common people. This, like the "Peninsula Hotel" located in Tsim Sha Tsui, is one of the most famous noble hotels in Hong Kong. Of course, these are just "gifts" for wealthy gentlemen from the mainland.

We should not think that the mountain is high and the transportation is inconvenient, which is undoubtedly a "杞憂 (groundless worry)." The transportation here is a very smooth and wide asphalt road for the convenience of those "who have cars." In addition, there is also the very famous "Peak Tram" for sightseeing. This kind of car is commonly called "Peak Train" by Hong Kong people, but it is not like a regular train, only the form and appearance are similar. This kind of car is connected by a very strong cable, and it goes up the mountain at an angle of thirty or forty degrees. It runs very slowly, which is very suitable for enjoying the mountain scenery.

The mountain is artificially transplanted with many European or African tropical plants, and the suitable location of Hong Kong, and the seaside on all sides, so the temperature here is really very suitable, not cold or hot, which is very commendable, no wonder many people often travel here.

This is undoubtedly a heavenly world. Everything in the world can be washed away here. It is a pure world. However, of course, this is also very disgusting, just like all the gentlemen's places of enjoyment. This is not only because the artificial "artificiality" has rendered the flesh and blood of countless poor people, (just the installation of the "Peak Tram" alone, it is said that I don't know how many Chinese workers have died.) and squeezed the food of how many people; even from its own point of view, those fat white gentlemen sitting on the sofa, aren't their stomachs often calculating how to eat other people's blood to fatten themselves?

However, some people still say that the city of "mountains" and the city of "water" - Venice - each have their own charm.

### The Ox Cart

— Lu Ping

The sun has quietly hidden behind a gray cloud, the sky is covered with a thick gloom, the cold wind is howling, the dust and sand are flying, and the entire universe seems to be freezing.

"The climate in the north is indeed different from that in the south..." Thinking of this, I turned a hillside and walked onto the sheep intestine path to Baowang: but from here to Baowang there are still more than twenty miles.

The old ox seemed very tired, and he was slowly advancing along the deserted path. I looked at the sky, and it was getting darker and darker every moment, the wind was howling, and it seemed like it was about to snow. I was anxious, hoping to get to Baowang as soon as possible, but he was just slowly walking, not willing to run fast at all. I desperately whipped him, but it was still useless.

The wheels were rolling on the not-so-flat mountain path, bumping very hard, almost overturning a carload of sorghum. I was very worried that I would fall into the mountain gully with the car and the people.

Today, the old ox was acting strangely, his feet were always sticking like heavy lead, and he couldn't lift them up. Although the whip was constantly waving on his butt, every time he was whipped, he barely ran a few steps, but after running seven or eight steps, he stopped moving forward again. I was really a little angry, was he intentionally messing with me today? So, the heavy whip rained down on his legs and body.

"Cheap beast, cheap beast, cheap beast!" Snap - snap - snap... But, I immediately took back the whip I was whipping him with, and said with pity, "Maybe, maybe he is already sick!"

He was really too hard-working. Spring plowing, autumn harvest, summer weeding, winter transportation, he would not have much time to rest throughout the year, and he would not be fed good food.

The weather was really cold, the wind was almost like a knife on my face, and the fingers on both hands seemed to have been cut off. I pulled down the ears on the felt hat to cover my face, and kissed my fingers on my mouth, still strenuously whipping the old ox on the butt, and mustered my courage to move forward on the winding mountain road.

The bare tree trunks were shaking their heads in the air, a group of bald crows, "ya! ya! ya!" were flying around in the dead forest, as if they couldn't find their old home. I sat anxiously on the ox cart, like a lonely traveling monk, rushing on the lonely long journey, this broken wooden cart and the weak old ox were my only companions.

The black curtain in the high sky gradually unfolded, and everything on the earth was swallowed up by the demon of the night.

"It's night, what can I do?" Thinking that there were at least ten miles to Baowang, my body was cold, my stomach was hungry, and the old ox could no longer walk. I was afraid: although I still had three dried buns that I hadn't eaten in my pocket, I didn't even think about eating them now, the cold sweat on my back was soaking wet, and the goosebumps were standing up one by one. I was thinking to myself, don't let a terrible beast jump out now and devour me.

Clumps of trees moved past me, sometimes startling a turtledove, which flew up with a crash, startling me. A crash flew up, startling me. The nightingale on the soil hill beside me was also "hating! hating!" calling out, and several wolf howls were faintly heard in the distance: I trembled, held my breath, and no matter how tired the old ox was, I desperately added the whip to his butt.

Gradually, I could see some lights, and the barking of the dogs in Baowang could be faintly heard, so I let go of my hanging heart and my courage suddenly grew a lot. I kissed my numb hands and wiped the cold sweat from my forehead with my cuffs.

"Here we are, you can rest for a while, hurry up, we'll be there in a moment." I gently patted the old ox on the back with the whip, as if comforting him, and said to him like coaxing a child.

### Sleepless Night

— Liu Wang

Perhaps it's because I haven't been in a good mood lately, but when I get into bed, a lot of thoughts, I don't know where they come from, thousands of them, surround me like ropes, making me unable to fall asleep immediately. After a fairly long time, after those thoughts have confused my brain, I will vaguely fall into a dream.

But, I don't know when, I will wake up for no reason. I think the time since I really fell asleep won't be long, right? At this time, the night is already very deep, but there is no way to determine what time it is, although the clock is ticking non-stop. Its even sound echoes the beating of my heart, making my heart feel extraordinarily empty and extraordinarily heavy.

I turned over, and the small iron bed made a creaking sound, but I still didn't sleep comfortably. I barely closed my eyes, as if I was under some kind of pressure, and soon they opened again like springs. Looking at the dark room, a sense of emptiness deeply attacked me. Sleeping alone in this room, I also felt even smaller.

The light from the street lamp penetrates through the glass window and shines on the wall, drawing a faint line. It seems so powerless and so desolate. And the jagged bare branches of the French parasol tree in front of the window constantly caress the wall with its shadow, like the small hands of many demons, casting a hypnosis, waiting for people to quietly fall asleep, to seize your soul.

It is very quiet outside, except for the whistling of the night wind, and the rustling sound of it shaking the branches and falling a few leaves, I can't hear anything else. It's as scary as being in a desolate wilderness.

Therefore, I really thought of the lives of people in primitive societies, and the lives of those savage ethnic groups in the deep mountains of Africa and southwestern China; and from this scene, I thought of what the state should be in the quiet night in my hometown at this time; until many chaotic thoughts led me to the edge of the dreamland, suddenly a burst of sound outside woke me up.

"Hu—" Like a whirlwind, a car sped past the asphalt road in front of the window. Although it was such a light and clear sound, it temporarily broke the night silence of the city, like a bright meteor that flashed across the dark blue sky of summer night.

Maybe this car is carrying those young masters, just returning tired from dancing in the dance hall, I thought. Otherwise, what important matter would there be at this time to drive outside in a car? Surely, it belongs to a night enjoyer with blurry eyes; maybe, next to him, there is a beautiful geisha leaning, showing off her seductive charm!

And soon, in the distance, the factory siren sounded a return sound. Those different tunes are competing for who can bark loudly, with intonation, excitedly, like the mad howling of hungry wolves in the deep mountains. From the factory gate - the gate as big as the bloody mouth of a wolf, many crowds who have been squeezed dry of their flesh and blood will begin to be spit out; at the same time, a new team will pour in like waves to fill the empty seat. Thinking of this, I felt an unbearable shudder, and unstoppable anger and injustice.

I long for the sky to brighten up soon.
