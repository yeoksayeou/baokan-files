### Enemy Attempts to Land Desperately, Fiercely Attacking Wusong and Pudong, All Repelled

No Enemy Traces Remain Within the Pudong Area. Yesterday at Dusk, Our Forces Advanced and Occupied the Hengbang Bridge Pier. Remnants of the Enemy East of Zhabu Road Are Under Siege.

In recent days, enemy troops have been retreating in successive defeats, their strength exhausted and depleted. In the areas of Hongkou and Yangshupu, they have no room for maneuver. However, with reinforcements concentrated outside the Wusongkou, they have no choice but to seek another way out, attempting to land. Therefore, over the past two days, a large number of warships stationed outside the Wusongkou concentrated their artillery fire and launched a sudden attack on Wusong and Pudong, hoping to cover their reinforcements landing, attack our rear, and provide support. However, our coastal and river ports are all heavily guarded, awaiting the enemy. Although the enemy repeatedly probed, the result ultimately ended in failure. Yesterday morning at one o'clock, the right wing of our army attacked the enemy forces entrenched on North Sichuan Road from Qiujiang Road. The enemy resisted stubbornly, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat for a long time. Our army launched a brave and fierce attack, and the enemy finally collapsed and was defeated. Around three o'clock, they occupied the Shanghai Grand Theatre. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy set fire to houses to prevent our army from pursuing them. The vicinity of the Hongkou Grand Hotel was also affected. Our army divided into two routes, pursuing the victory: one advancing towards Bazilu, and the other searching north and south along North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road. Enemy troops fled towards Wusong Road, Zhabu Road, and the northern end of Waibaidu Bridge. Currently, North Henan Road and North Jiangxi Road are free of enemy traces. Our advancing troops, after several hours of bloody battle, finally arrived at the southern end of Hengbangju yesterday evening. At one o'clock this morning, fierce fighting was still taking place across the river at that location, and close contact had been established with the area around Xianghong Bridge. The enemy's situation is becoming increasingly dire, and the enemy headquarters at the Jiangwan Road intersection is increasingly isolated. The area east of Zhabu Road, Tiantong Road, Peng Road, and all the way to Broadway Road is completely surrounded by our army. As for Yangshupu, since our army intercepted them from the Huishan Wharf, they have been in a desperate situation on all sides. However, that area is full of tall buildings, and the remnants of the enemy army are scattered and hiding within them, resisting stubbornly, making it difficult to annihilate them immediately. It is necessary to use other effective methods to make it impossible for them to find peace, and then drive them out in a unified manner, which will not be difficult.

(Central News Agency) On the Zhabei front, our army advanced to North Sichuan Road and, after occupying the Shanghai Grand Theatre, immediately divided into two routes to pursue the victory. As of last night, our army had reached Lao Bazilu in the south, and the enemy was retreating towards Haining Road. In the north, they crossed Dadelu and reached Hengbang Bridge, and the enemy was retreating north of the Hengbang River. At the same time, Qiujiang Road had linked up with our central army in the Xingjiazhai area. The enemy trapped in the Haining Road, Futong Road, and Wusong Road area, as well as the enemy command at the end of North Sichuan Road, are all trapped in a heavy encirclement and will soon be completely annihilated. Since yesterday morning, the enemy has been constructing defensive works at the northern end of the North Sichuan Road bridge, and the urgency of their situation can be imagined. The enemy Marine Corps Commander Okochikai also clearly admitted the difficulty of fighting in Shanghai when he met with Japanese newspaper reporters yesterday morning.

According to the Central News Agency, fierce fighting broke out again on all fronts at 11:40 last night. In the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts, the sound of heavy artillery was like a string of pearls. The reporter stood on a nine-story building to observe, and the flashes of artillery fire were as fast as meteors. Our artillery positions concentrated their firepower and bombarded the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. The target was extremely accurate. Enemy ships in the Huangpu River also returned fire. At the same time, the sound of machine guns and rifles on North Sichuan Road and Broadway Road was as dense as a string of pearls, clearly audible, indicating that our army's advance was getting closer and closer to the enemy, which was very successful. During the most intense fighting, two enemy planes flew out to scout at 12:25.

### Enemy Warships Fiercely Attack Wusong, Failing

The Battle at the Wusong Estuary Is Even More Intense Than the Previous Night. Enemy Attempts to Steal Across in Small Boats Were All Repelled by Us.

Special dispatch from this newspaper: The enemy army, suffering successive defeats in the eastern district, Hongkou, and Zhabei of Shanghai, is striving for new developments, hoping to land at the Pu coast and along the coast. Currently, there are about 40 enemy ships anchored in the Bailonggang and Sanjiashui area of Chuansha, including one aircraft carrier anchored at Bailonggang. On the night of the 21st, enemy ships concentrated their artillery fire to attack Wusong in an attempt to cover a landing. Our side immediately responded calmly and returned fire with heavy artillery. For a time, the artillery fire was dense, and the sound of explosions broke the silence of the dark night. The enemy army ultimately had no opportunity to take advantage of. Yesterday morning, enemy ships attacked again for the second time, and more than a dozen small boats, full of enemy troops, advanced towards the Pu coast. At the same time, the enemy air force also came out to assist in the battle, making it even more intense than the previous night. Our army also attacked with artillery and machine guns, and the morale was high. The two sides exchanged fire for two or three hours, and as a result, the enemy army was still repelled by us. We suffered no losses. According to the Central News Agency, at 5:00 a.m. yesterday, three Japanese warships at Liuhe and Yanglinkou fired artillery shells at the opposite bank and then sailed south. At 6:00 a.m., two enemy planes circled over Fuqiao and then flew to Yanglinkou, dropping two bombs and flying south.

### Enemy Troops Completely Swept Away in Pudong

Enemy Troops Secretly Crossing Engage in Fierce Fighting for Three Hours, Retreating Back to Their Ships, Many Drowning

According to a military agency announcement, yesterday morning, a unit of our Pudong garrison completely encircled and attacked enemy troops who secretly crossed over to Pudong. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy troops could not withstand it and retreated completely. Our army has completely swept away the enemy along the Pudong River bank. Our army went straight to the riverbank and set up a cordon. There are no enemy traces in Pudong. From now on, the enemy has no chance of a sneak attack. Although the enemy army uses naval artillery bombardment, it is not enough to shake us in the slightest.

According to the Central News Agency, before dawn yesterday morning, enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River took advantage of the darkness to secretly cross over, attempting to land in the area of the Mitsui Wharf under the cover of artillery fire. They were bravely repelled by our army, and the enemy suffered many casualties.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At 10:00 p.m. the night before last, Japanese warships anchored on the Pu surface in the Qichangzhan area of Pudong concentrated their firepower and bombarded our Pudong positions. Our army also returned fire. After half an hour, they mixed in machine gun fire to sweep the shore. Before long, they mobilized troops under the moonlight, using guns and artillery as cover, and forcibly landed at the New Mitsui and New Mitsubishi wharf. After investigation, it was found that the two wharves had already been occupied by our army on the evening of the 17th. We urgently used machine gunners and grenades to bravely fight back, and the battle lasted for three hours. The Japanese army ultimately failed and retreated back to their ships. At that time, many people fell into the river and drowned. However, the enemy ships' ambitions were not dead, and they launched several more violent charges. Our machine gun bullets fell like rain, and it was difficult for the Japanese army to cross the Lei Chi line. The fighting lasted until 5:00 a.m., and then the sound of gunfire gradually subsided. In this battle, our army suffered no damage. However, the enemy army fired their guns and artillery indiscriminately, without any target. When the battle was fierce, enemy machine gun bullets even fell on ships parked at the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession. A customs patrol ship parked on the Pu surface at that location was also pierced by an enemy artillery shell. People expected that the enemy army's goals had not been achieved and that they would make a final struggle, but our army's strength is strong and its precautions are strict, so there is nothing to worry about.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At 0:40 a.m. yesterday morning, our army in Pudong fiercely bombarded the enemy army in the Mitsui Wharf area. The bombardment was most intense around 1:00 a.m., and then stopped slightly at 2:00 a.m. At 4:20 a.m., our army bombarded that area again with more than 30 shells. At that time, a warship in the Huangpu River returned fire at our army. Our artillery then concentrated its fire on the warship and bombarded it fiercely. Many civilians along the river witnessed the enemy warship being hit in its vital forward part by our artillery shells after only returning fire with four or five shells. They personally saw the warship fleeing in a panic.

According to the Central News Agency, at 3:00 p.m. on the 21st, a Japanese warship actually secretly flew the British flag and moved from the Huangpu River towards Pudong, attempting to deceive our garrison. When it approached, it was discovered that it was carrying Japanese troops. Our troops immediately opened fire, killing dozens of people. The warship returned fire, and we also suffered casualties. The battle lasted for about 20 minutes, and the warship retreated because it could not withstand it. The cowardice and shamelessness of the enemy army can be seen from this.

### Our Army Firmly Occupies North Sichuan Road

The Enemy's Special Marine Corps Unit Is About to Be Eliminated. A Japanese Deserter Climbing on a Rooftop Was Shot Down by British Troops.

According to the Central News Agency, our army's right wing front has indeed advanced to North Sichuan Road, and that road has indeed been occupied by us. According to military information from the Huadong News Agency, the daredevil team of our army [unit name obscured] in Zhabei charged east along Qiujiang Road at 1:00 a.m. yesterday morning, attacking the enemy army entrenched on North Sichuan Road. After a hand-to-hand combat, our army advanced to the Shanghai Grand Theatre at 3:00 a.m. The enemy army retreated in a panic, and we are still pursuing the victory, advancing towards Bazilu. We will soon be able to establish contact with our eastern army that has occupied Lihong Bridge.

Special dispatch from this newspaper: The Japanese elementary school on Peng Road and Nanxun Road has been destroyed by our army's heavy artillery bombardment. The Japanese team of the International Settlement Volunteers (i.e., the East Asia Japanese Volunteer Corps), which was originally stationed at the school, moved to the Gongji Hospital on North Suzhou Road at about 6:00 p.m. yesterday.

According to a tea servant who had just escaped from the Japanese elementary school at 569 North Sichuan Road, speaking to a Ta Kung Pao reporter yesterday, 30 enemy troops were originally stationed at the school. When our central army advanced to the Huade Road area on the 19th, they felt extremely panicked and immediately fled with guns and ammunition along Dalianwan Road to Yangshupu. Unexpectedly, they were intercepted by our army, which aimed machine guns and swept them. As a result, only two people escaped back, and the remaining 28 were annihilated.

Opposite the Willie Cinema at the intersection of Haining Road and Zhabu Road is the enemy's special Marine Corps unit. Although its scale is not as grand as the other command centers of the Japanese bandits, it is also one of their aggressive mechanisms. Now that the enemy is about to be annihilated, and the command centers in various places have been destroyed by our army one after another, only this Marine Corps unit has survived for the time being. However, based on the overall situation, the day of its destruction should also be just around the corner.

At about 8:00 p.m. the night before last, six or seven Japanese soldiers suddenly climbed onto the roofs of civilian houses near Haining Road on North Henan Road, moving from east to west, plotting something. British troops discovered this and immediately aimed machine guns and fired. One person fell to the ground in response, with more than ten bullets in his body, and died early. The remaining few people all fell to the east, their life or death unknown. The body was taken away by the Japanese side at about 7:00 a.m. yesterday.

### Enemy Headquarters Already in Dire Straits

Surrounded on Three Sides by Our Army, the Besieged Remnants Have No Room to Maneuver

Confirmed information: Yesterday morning, after our army occupied the vicinity of the Shanghai Grand Theatre, it cut North Sichuan Road into two sections. In the morning, our army searched and advanced towards the northeast. In the afternoon, the enemy counterattacked with reinforcements, and the fighting lasted for four hours. Our army advanced north along North Sichuan Road and crossed Dadelu at about 6:00 p.m. The enemy retreated north of the Binbang Bridge, resisting stubbornly from the bridge. There are no enemy traces south of the Hengbang Bridge. Our central, northern, and western armies have linked up and will use a steady and solid strategy to eliminate the remnants of the enemy army gathered around the Japanese headquarters.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) According to a gentleman who returned from the front lines, the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters on Jiangwan Road, after being bombarded by our artillery for several days, is full of bullet holes and has lost its former grandeur. The enemies who are stubbornly resisting, knowing that their retreat will be cut off, are still putting up a desperate fight to maintain the majesty of their imperial army. Our army is on high alert and will wait for the opportunity to mature, surround and attack from all sides, and will definitely be able to annihilate them in one fell swoop. According to the current situation, our army is east of Hongkou Park, north to the 63 Flower Garden, and south to North Sichuan Road, surrounded on three sides. The area occupied by the enemy's nest is no more than one square mile. Yesterday, our army used the most accurate telescopes to observe. The fourth floor of the enemy headquarters had already been destroyed by us. The third floor is now deploying artillery, the second floor is deploying heavy machine guns, and the lower floor is deploying light machine guns, concentrating on defense. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for us to capture it. According to this situation, it may not be easy to succeed without a heavy artillery siege.

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, our army's right wing, taking advantage of the panic of the enemy army when the central army suddenly advanced into Huishan Wharf, also launched a fierce attack on a large scale. After several bloody battles, they advanced to the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road and controlled the enemy army in the Xiejiamuqiao Road and Shiqing Road areas, thereby echoing our army in the Lihong Bridge area and eliminating the remnants of the enemy army east of North Sichuan Road and south of Qiujiang Road. The enemy Marine Corps headquarters on Jiangwan Road has been surrounded by our army on the east, west, and north sides. Only the line connecting North Sichuan Road to the south is still occupied by the enemy, relying on it as a way out. The only line of activity is also the line from Dixiwei Road to Wusong Road, and the area of activity is in Baolean Road, Hagu Road, and Changchun Road, which is a very narrow range. Therefore, even if the enemy camp has copper walls and iron walls, it will be difficult to defend for a long time.

### Remnants of the Enemy in Yangshupu to Be Cleared

Our Army Forces the Remnants of the Enemy to Retreat and Gather by the River, Where the Armies Will Meet to Annihilate Them in One Fell Swoop

Confirmed information: The remnants of the enemy army in the Yangshupu area have all retreated and gathered at the Shenxin Yarn Factory, Shanghai Textile Factory No. 1, Gongda Factory No. 2, Shanghai Yarn Weaving Factory No. 4, Sanxin Yarn Factory, Osaka Wharf, and Huangpu Wharf, relying on solid buildings as strongholds and deploying artillery positions and anti-aircraft guns in an attempt to make a final struggle. Yesterday (22nd) afternoon, enemy ships at Osaka Wharf and Huangpu Wharf were loading military supplies and were busy loading and unloading them. Another part of the remnants of the enemy army was scattered and, according to the houses in the streets, fired at our army from time to time. Our army is now gradually pursuing along the river from the battle line developed yesterday morning, pressing the remnants of the enemy army on the river bank and annihilating them in one fell swoop. According to a report from a gentleman who escaped from Yangshupu, the remnants of the enemy army are all Marine Corps and veterans, with no army, and their combat capability is extremely weak. It is expected that their resistance will not be strong and can be quickly cleared.

According to the Central News Agency, a unit of the remnants of the enemy army is entrenched in the Jardine Matheson yarn factory, a British merchant, near the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Sheng Road. However, the British flag is still flying on the roof of the factory. The enemy is using foreign ships and flags to cover up, and their intentions are truly despicable.

According to the Central News Agency, the British tram company's car shed opposite the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu has been occupied by the enemy army and set up as a transportation headquarters. There are 20 tanks, 20 trucks, and thousands of boxes of various weapons in it.

### Enemy Troops Cross the Suzhou Creek Again and Flee South

They Were Disarmed by British Soldiers and Escorted to Gordon Road. Since the Start of the War, the Enemy Army Has Suffered 6,000 Casualties.

Confirmed information from the Central News Agency: Because they could not withstand the advance of our army, the remnants of the enemy army have been retreating towards the Suzhou Creek for days. As of yesterday, a total of more than 900 people had surrendered their weapons voluntarily. The morale of the army is disintegrating, and the soldiers have no fighting spirit. This can be seen from this.

Confirmed information: Yesterday afternoon, more than 300 Japanese soldiers crossed the Waibaidu Bridge and were disarmed by British soldiers and transported to Gordon Road. It is estimated that the enemy who have been disarmed before and after have reached more than 900 people.

In addition, since the enemy has been fighting with us, no less than 6,000 people have been killed or injured, and nearly 1,000 have voluntarily escaped the battle line and been taken in by the British army. More than half have been lost. Now, the total number of the remnants of the enemy army fighting with us is no more than 6,000 people. Although they rely on strongholds and resist tenaciously, the enemy's courage has been chilled and they have no strength to struggle. They are only deceived by their superiors and are afraid to surrender. Therefore, the time for a complete solution is not far away.

### Our Planes Bomb Enemy Positions

Enemy Warships Fire More Than 60 Artillery Shells in Panic. Our Planes Circle and Drop Bombs Before Returning.

Several of our bombers, under the cover of fighter planes, flew to Shanghai yesterday at 1:15 p.m. to bomb the enemy army. As our planes flew from west to east, just as they reached the airspace over the special district, enemy warships in the Huangpu River hastily fired anti-aircraft artillery continuously, firing more than 60 shells in total. Our planes still flew calmly to the airspace over Hongkou and, under the cover of a large fire smokescreen, dropped many bombs on the enemy's positions. Then, they flew to Yangshupu to bomb the enemy's positions and to Wusongkou to bomb the enemy ships. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. After about 40 minutes, our planes flew to the airspace over Hongkou again. Enemy warships fired anti-aircraft artillery again, but our planes calmly dropped many bombs before safely leaving Shanghai and returning.

### Enemy Planes Drop Bombs Everywhere Indiscriminately

One Plane Has Been Hit in the Tail by Us. Bombing a British Factory Shows That They Have No Target.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At 5:30 yesterday morning, three enemy planes flew along the Huangpu River to the 16th Pier and Pudong to scout. At 7:15, three more enemy planes came to the skies over our Nanshi several times and flew to a certain place to drop two bombs. After being surrounded by our anti-aircraft artillery, they quickly escaped.

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At about 7:00 a.m. today, eight enemy planes flew to Pudong and dropped seven bombs, all of which landed in open spaces, so there were no losses.

At 7:00 yesterday morning, three enemy planes flew to the Longhua area of Nanshi and bombed. At 2:00 p.m., five enemy planes flew to various places in southern Shanghai to scout and drop bombs. They actually dropped three bombs at the British merchant China Shipbuilding and Dismantling Factory in Sanjiali, Longhua Road, but there were no losses. The factory had a British coat of arms hanging high, but they still bombed indiscriminately. It can be seen that they have no target at all. At the same time, three enemy planes dropped three bombs at the Nanhuangpu and Beipiao coal yards. At 4:00, three enemy planes flew to Zhoujiadu and dropped four bombs. We suffered no losses.

According to Shenshi News Agency, at 9:00 this morning, a large squadron of enemy planes flew over the Zhabei positions, attempting to drop bombs. In the airspace over Zhongshan Road, our bomber squadron also arrived, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle in the high altitude. They fired machine guns at each other, as dense as a string of pearls, with sparks flying everywhere. Because the enemy planes were afraid of being surrounded, they did not dare to linger and fled in all directions after 15 minutes. Our planes pursued the victory for a distance before returning victoriously.

An enemy plane at Qingning Temple dived obliquely into the cement wall of the Meifu Company, falling in front of the city ferry terminal. The pilot, knowing that he could not fly anymore, set it on fire himself.

A telegram from Taicang said that seven enemy planes circled over the city and bombed it this morning. According to people coming to Shanghai from Kunshan, enemy planes have been flying to Kunshan in groups to bomb it every day recently. Six enemy planes came to bomb it again on the morning of the day before yesterday.

### Japanese Goodwill Mission Comes to Shanghai to Observe the War

They Came with Great Interest, But They Will Surely Return Disappointed. Whether They Can Land in Shanghai Is Still a Question.

The general public in Japan has no accurate knowledge of the course of the war in Shanghai and the latest real situation, resulting in various rumors and unresolved doubts. The leaders of all walks of life and the two houses of parliament in that country have now selected representatives totaling more than 120 people to form a goodwill mission to make a special trip to Shanghai and observe the actual situation in Shanghai. The mission was scheduled to be escorted to Shanghai on a special ship dispatched by the Ministry of the Navy on the 20th of this month. Whether the mission can land in Shanghai after arriving in Shanghai is still a question.

### Enemy Warships Hold a Summit Meeting and Hoist the Blue Sky and White Sun Flag

They Are Afraid of Our Planes Bombing Them, Showing Such Cowardice. The Injured Izumo Anchors at the Gonghexiang Wharf.

Yesterday afternoon, two destroyers of the Japanese Navy's First Fleet sailed and anchored in front of the Zhaoshang North Pier and the Waibaidu Bridge Garden. The Izumo is still anchored between the Gonghexiang and Shuntai wharves. It is reported that the ordnance technicians who have been ordered to stay in Shanghai are repairing the various gun emplacements and machinery damaged by the vibration on the ship. It is also reported that the ship is the flagship commanding the existing enemy ships in Shanghai and cannot be moved away from the Huangpu River without orders from Tokyo.

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter looked out over the Huangpu River from the roof of a building somewhere and was surprised to find a warship flying our national flag. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that it was the enemy's Kawauchi warship. The enemy's army and navy headquarters were holding a meeting on board to discuss how to support the remaining forces. Because they were afraid of being bombed by our air force, they hoisted our national flag. Their cowardice and boredom are truly unprecedented in history.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Preliminary Work for Controlled Industries

— Liu

Since this war, it has become even clearer that Japanese factories in China have a dual role. In peacetime, they serve as tools for economic aggression. In wartime, they transform into military bases. For example, the Yangshupu Public Cotton Mill and the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters on North Sichuan Road form a strategic pincer, serving as two major command centers for this operation. Similarly, the Rihua Cotton Mill in Pudong secretly harbored Japanese soldiers, intending to disrupt our rear lines. Other examples include the Toyota Cotton Mill near the Zhongshan Road Bridge and the Nei Wai Cotton Mills along the Suzhou Creek. While these were not directly involved in the current conflict, their locations are crucial to our land and water transportation. They can be used as battlements for offense or to disrupt our transportation for retreat. All this shows that Japanese factories conceal countless artillery and soldiers, ready to coordinate an attack on us at any time. Like a bird's nest on a precarious curtain, our countrymen did not realize the danger. Now, they must deeply awaken and learn to be vigilant.

During the January 28th Incident, we saw the enemy destroying our industries everywhere and the devastating power of heavy artillery and aircraft. We believed that concentrating factories in one area made them vulnerable to enemy destruction. Later, with the onset of rural panic and the decline of handicrafts, we thought that rural revitalization required the support of industry and that factories should gradually move inland, with industry and agriculture complementing each other to achieve effective revitalization. At the time, some doubted the point of our words. In the past two years, there has been much talk about moving factories inland. However, relocating existing factories inland has its practical difficulties. New factories lack the courage to establish themselves inland. As a result, "industrial ruralization" remains a theory, difficult to realize. Since the outbreak of this war, most commentators agree that industry should move inland. But how easy is that? Not only is it currently impossible due to transportation limitations, but relocation cannot be done hastily. However, having experienced two major disasters, those engaged in industry must realize that developing inland is safer than coastal cities.

Although, this is also a single opportunity for internal migration. Many workers are returning to their hometowns or migrating inland. These skilled workers can be utilized locally. Simple equipment can easily be used for manufacturing. Moreover, for general consumer industries, apart from large-scale textile factories, the required machinery is not very complex. Such as the knitting industry, silk and cotton textile industry, food manufacturing industry, fuel manufacturing industry, and even casting and metalworking industries. Now that electricity is gradually being introduced in the countryside, starting businesses is not difficult. Moreover, after the prolonged shutdown of Shanghai cotton mills and the destruction they have suffered, the supply and demand of yarn and cloth will inevitably become unbalanced. It is not too late to seek remedies and plan ahead. However, Japan is preparing for a long-term war with plans to control the national economy. Our country should also catch up and quickly organize to prepare for control. Taking Shanghai as an example, the authorities should immediately develop a plan, provide detailed guidance, and supervise the various industry associations to create the most detailed investigation reports on their respective factories, distinguishing between: ㊀ merging factories and workshops located in the war zone into factories in safer areas for joint work, or allowing those who can establish their own factories; ㊁ finding ways to transport factories and machinery that can be moved inland, recruiting workers who have scattered inland to resume work; ㊂ many factory workers have regional ties, such as workers from a certain factory often being from a certain place, then it might as well be operated in the inland by means of labor-capital cooperation; ㊃ economic national defense should be built as soon as possible, on the one hand, to resist the enemy's economic destruction, and on the other hand, to maintain economic momentum and prepare for long-term war; ㊄ the construction of economic national defense should start from practical facts, not be limited to theory, and all parties should contribute good programs to the authorities and not publish them too much.

In short, in this period of serious national crisis, those with wealth should contribute wealth, those with strength should contribute strength, those with knowledge should contribute knowledge, and those with experience should contribute experience. No one sees, I see. Only know that the great enemy is in front of us. Burying your head, calming your courage, using your heart, and rushing forward to overcome this difficult time. It is an opportunity for the revival of the Chinese nation.

### Fierce Fighting Continues at Nankou

Heavy Enemy Casualties in Jinghai Battle   Heavy Artillery Fire at Duliu and Liangwangzhuang   Enemy Stealth Attack on Pinghan Railway Fails

[Guihua] The battle at Nankou remained fierce on the 22nd. Our army, in a superior position, had great advantages. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and was in extreme disarray. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

[Jinan] The fierce battle at Jinghai continued throughout the night. The sound of artillery fire was clearly heard at the station. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Our reinforcements have joined the battle, and fierce fighting is still underway at the time of the telegram. (Urgent telegram at 12:00 noon on the 22nd)

[Jinan] At 11:30 AM on the 22nd, fierce clashes broke out again between enemy and our forces between Duliu and Liangwangzhuang. Artillery fire was intense. 160 to 170 artillery shells landed seven or eight li north of Jinghai station. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. The stalemate continued into the evening. Our armored vehicles have been dispatched to the front to assist in the battle. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)

[Qingyuan] The Pinghan battle broke out on the 21st. An enemy sneak attack was thwarted, resulting in over a hundred enemy deaths. Five enemy aircraft came south to bomb. (Special dispatch on the 21st)

[Baoding] Approximately 500 enemy infantry and cavalry launched a joint surprise attack on our defense positions in Toutou Village on the morning of the 20th. Our forces met them head-on with a fierce counterattack. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and has now retreated to the areas of Tuoli, Shiti, Shawo, and Dadong Village, confronting our forces across the river, but still intermittently shelling our positions with artillery fire. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

[Tianjin] According to well-informed sources, a large Chinese army is stationed at Machang, about 50 miles from Tianjin, with some forces advancing closer to Tianjin. It is also said that a large army is advancing along the Baoding-Machang highway. It is reported that the Japanese have dispatched troops along the Grand Canal towards Machang to investigate the movements of the Chinese army. The Japanese army is currently preparing for air defense. It is rumored that anti-aircraft exercises with live ammunition will be conducted outside the southern and northern suburbs of Tianjin on the morning of the 21st. This proves that the Chinese Air Force has approached Tianjin. Heavy rain fell throughout the night yesterday. The Japanese army used searchlights to penetrate the low, dense clouds to prevent attacks by the Chinese Air Force. However, due to the bad weather, the exercise has been postponed to the 22nd. According to the same sources, there is no doubt that plainclothes teams have been deployed around Tianjin, constantly operating in the suburbs and harassing Japanese sentry posts at night, resulting in occasional rifle and light artillery fire. The activities of these plainclothes teams involve individuals or small groups, making their total number difficult to estimate. Whether these individuals are operating independently or are the vanguard of a larger army is still unknown. The Chinese army has not yet shown any signs of a frontal attack, as frequent heavy rains have caused extensive damage to the roads in the past few weeks, making troop movement difficult. Therefore, no major battles are expected to occur near Tianjin until the weather clears. It is said that the Japanese are currently defending Tianjin with a large army and are rushing to build barracks to accommodate them, but their strength is difficult to guess. At the same time, the consuls in Tianjin are registering foreigners without consular protection, presumably to estimate the amount of food needed in case of emergency or to make it difficult for these people to leave Tianjin. If they leave Tianjin, Beidaihe is likely to be used as a reception area. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Enemy Aircraft Raid on Nanjing Repelled

Our Searchlights Illuminate the Enemy, Thwarting Their Attack   They Hastily Drop Two Bombs, Both Landing in the Countryside

[Nanjing] Three enemy heavy bombers came to Nanjing at 7:45 PM on the 22nd, planning a night raid. We were well prepared, and searchlights illuminated the enemy aircraft, leaving them with no place to hide. At the same time, guns and cannons fired together, and the enemy aircraft became extremely panicked, hastily dropping two bombs and fleeing. Subsequent investigation revealed that the bombs landed in the countryside. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

[Changsha] A telephone report from Yuezhou stated that four abandoned aircraft were discovered 20 li from Yingyi City in the Lujiao area. Several bodies of enemy airmen were found in Dongting Lake. The cause was due to weather changes and engine failures causing them to crash. A detailed investigation is currently underway. (Special dispatch on the 21st)

[Changsha] Four Japanese aircraft attempted to raid Changsha along the Yuehan Railway's Wu-Gen section at 9:00 PM on the 21st. The Aviation Command received the report, and at 9:20 PM, implemented a blackout. The Japanese aircraft turned back at Polo and dropped bombs in Yuezhou before flying away. The alert was lifted in Changsha at 10:40 PM. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)

### Chen Duxiu's Sentence Reduced

### British Notables Comment on Britain, America, and Japan

Policies Are Growing Apart   Hoping the Japanese Authorities Realize

[London] The Sunday Times today published an article by Sir Frederick Whyte, former adviser to the British Legation in China, stating that Britain and America have the same interests in China, and that the two countries aim to promote the establishment of a strong and stable government in China to rule the united Chinese people. Japan is different. It constantly provokes local incidents and negotiates with local authorities, which violates the entire principle of the unity and stability of the Chinese government. Therefore, the policies of Britain and America are growing apart from Japan's policies year by year. However, Japan must trade with China, and its prosperity depends on China's wealth. Sir Frederick concluded by saying that all those who sincerely hope for the coexistence of the two countries now earnestly hope that Japanese politicians can realize this early. It is by no means certain that Japan can subdue the Chinese people by force. Only by recognizing the new China's demand for equal treatment can peace be preserved.

### Prisoners at the Ward Road Jail Evacuated to a Safe Area

2,000 Prisoners Released

The Ward Road Jail in this city, due to being in the line of fire, the concession authorities, after consulting with both the Chinese and Japanese sides, evacuated from the dangerous area to a safe area starting yesterday, classifying the severity of the crimes to release or transfer. The batch of about 6,000 Chinese and Western prisoners, of which there are 2,000 light offenders with fixed-term imprisonment, will be released, and were escorted out of prison yesterday and today. The first batch of 500 people were taken by eight public buses at noon, escorted by British troops, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and patrolmen from the Public Works Department, passing through the Garden Bridge and Nanjing Road. At one time, the road was especially guarded and pedestrians were prohibited from passing. The prisoners were received by our judicial authorities at the Caohejing Prison and will be given severance pay to return to their hometowns. The second batch was transferred at 4:00 p.m., also with 500 people. 250 of them were healthy and have also been released. There are still 250 people who are ill or injured, and they have been sent to the hospital for treatment. The prisoners from various countries will be taken away and dealt with by their respective consuls.

(Special report from this newspaper) After the meeting of the Consular Body and the Shanghai Municipal Council's police department the day before yesterday, it has been decided to abandon the West Prison for humanitarian reasons. Except for those sentenced to death and life imprisonment, all others will be released. First, all prisoners will be evacuated from the south of the Suzhou River. The transfer started yesterday, and it is planned to complete all procedures in four or five days.

Police Officer Bowes, the Superintendent, is currently managing this matter. It is said that all procedures have been prepared, and it is planned to transfer 1,000 to 1,500 Chinese prisoners to the Chinese territory every day. In this way, it can be completed in four or five days. The Chinese Red Swastika Society is prepared to assist in transporting the Chinese prisoners through the front line of the Chinese army to the rear. If time permits, the prison authorities plan to give each prisoner a small amount of clothing and food, as well as their own belongings, so that they can survive.

The most difficult part is the criminals who do not enjoy consular jurisdiction, such as Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, Latvians, etc. These criminals will be allowed to choose whether to follow the Chinese prisoners into the Chinese territory and be released, or follow other Western prisoners into the Concession and be held in the detention center until the end of their term. However, those who are eligible for parole will still be released.

### National Salvation Donations

Drafting a "National Salvation Donation" from Landlords, Overseas Chinese Friends Enthusiastically Donate Military Supplies

The Cotton Fabric Trade Association has established a "National Salvation Donation Raising Committee" and resolved to raise 100,000 yuan. Appeals are being made to various businesses in the industry. It is reported that over 60,000 yuan has already been pledged.

The Silk and Satin Trade Association has committed to a first installment of 100,000 yuan for the "National Salvation Donation." Due to the impact of the closure of silver exchange businesses, the already collected 40,000-plus yuan is being submitted first. A telegram has also been sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, stating that 20,000 yuan is intended to be used to comfort air force soldiers and honor those who have died in battle.

The First Special District Citizens' United Association of this city sent a letter yesterday to the Anti-Enemy Fundraising Committee, suggesting that a plan be established immediately to jointly levy a "National Salvation Donation" from landlords, or to have tenants pay on behalf of landlords based on the amount of rent. The receipts from these donations would then be used as rent payments. In this way, a large sum of money could be quickly raised, creating a significant effect in supporting the war effort.

The Children's National Salvation Association's fundraising team, protected by six Boy Scouts, went to various locations yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m. to solicit donations. This morning, they had already purchased 1,000 undershirts, printed with the large red characters "Give Me Back My Land," to comfort wounded soldiers.

It is also reported that the representatives have established a long-term "National Salvation Donation," to be made monthly during the war. It is hoped that other foreign businesses will also follow suit, fulfilling their national duty.

All 180-plus ticket inspectors and clerks of the Military Vehicle Company in the Public Concession—Xu Dachun, Li Songtang, Zou Yuanyuan, Zhou Ronghua, and others—have launched an initiative to donate one yuan in legal tender per person to comfort frontline soldiers in this city.

During this war of resistance by our military, friendly European and American nations have expressed deep sympathy. The Local Association reported that a certain Westerner personally delivered a telescope yesterday, intending it to be given to the front lines, but refused to reveal his name. Today, the China Navigation Company forwarded cotton yarn and cloth items, valued at 200 yuan, donated by Mr. & Mrs. S. Pollock.

Mr. Wang Shuhe and Mr. Huang Yao'er have raised funds among colleagues at the National Credit Bank to donate seven motorized bicycles, which have been handed over to the Local Association to be sent to the front lines for use. The Shanghai Women's Movement League has raised funds for twelve new-style bicycles, which have also been forwarded to the front lines.

Trains

The Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger train service, which had been temporarily suspended after the Shanghai battle due to the bombing of bridges No. 31 and No. 34, has been repaired and resumed operations. Service to Beijing-Shanghai has been suspended for several days, but starting today, there will be two train services available, both stopping at the two Shanghai stations.

Furthermore, according to reliable information from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, transportation between this city and other places has been extremely difficult since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. As a result of the Bureau's efforts to make plans, it was decided to run one Shanghai-Jinan and one Shanghai-Zhapu passenger train yesterday (the 22nd). (1) The Shanghai-Jinan train, which goes directly from Shanghai to Jinan via Nanjing, departs from the West Station (梵皇渡) at 5:30 p.m. (2) The Shanghai-Zhapu train, which goes directly from Shanghai to Zhapu, also departs from the West Station at 2:30 p.m. The Bureau is also preparing to add one Beijing-Shanghai and one Beijing-Zhapu passenger train.

Telephone

The original Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone line, which had been temporarily suspended for registration and calls due to busy official calls, resumed normal calls yesterday morning.

Trams

After partially resuming a few days ago, transportation in the Public Concession and French Concession saw the resumption of trolleybus lines 17 and 18 in the French Concession yesterday, running between the Great World, the Chu Chia Wan, and the Avenue du Grand Palais. However, the iron gate on the Nanyang Bridge side was not open, so they detoured via Route Tenant de St. Paul. In addition, public bus lines 6 and 3 in the Public Concession also operated yesterday. Several iron gates on the roads between Nanshi and the French Concession were opened yesterday, such as those at Xujiahui, Route Cardinal Mercier, and the Old North Gate, allowing free passage for pedestrians and vehicles.

Automobiles

Yesterday, a total of thirty public buses continued to operate smoothly within the Public Concession. There are currently two routes between the central and western districts. One is Route 1, which passes through Edward VII Park, Avenue Edward VII, and Nanjing Road to the Bund. The other is Route 9, which passes through Bubbling Well Road, Rue Amiral Foch, and Avenue Edward VII to the Bund of the French Concession. In addition, Route 10, which runs from Route Pottier to Xin Zha Road and Beijing Road to the Bund, is expected to continue to operate tomorrow. There are currently 30 public buses parked inside the Racecourse and 20 parked in the open space at the intersection of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road, ready for use. The remaining vehicles of the Public Bus Company are currently parked in the factory.

### Various Places Send Condolences to Commander Zhang

People from all over the country have sent telegrams of condolence. Two of these telegrams are recorded below. (1) To General Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, and all anti-enemy soldiers: The violent bandits are rampant, invading Shanghai again, and a major battle has broken out. Fortunately, Your Excellency has led your troops to bravely resist, with loyalty and enthusiasm that will be recorded forever in history. The people in the rear are all inspired and will firmly support you. We hope that you will order a general offensive as soon as possible, and the Japanese bandits can be wiped out in one stroke.

### The Five Fen Coin at the Great World Tragedy as a Last Gesture

The North China Daily News reports that after the bomb tragedy that occurred in front of the Great World on August 14, the Central Fire Brigade of the Public Concession dispatched a fire truck driven by Deputy Chief Somers upon receiving the news. Initially, they did not know the truth, but they saw many dead and wounded. Somers quickly climbed onto the truck and entered a store on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession to make a phone call to the Chief of the Fire Brigade to send all the ambulances. However, the phone required a five-fen coin to make a call. Somers did not have one on him. At the time, several men and women were lying dead in the store. Somers asked the surviving few if they had the coin. A man was lying on the floor of the store with both legs broken and one arm hanging from the elbow. The man used his uninjured hand to feel for a five-fen coin and gave it to Somers, then gave a final smile and passed away. Such a person can be said to be brave even at the moment of death.

### Du Yuesheng Speaks Out, Urging Citizens to Enthusiastically Contribute

Emphasizing that Citizens Should Voluntarily Fulfill Their National Duty; Donation Receipts Can Be Exchanged for National Salvation Bonds

Since the launch of the Songhu War of Resistance, all sectors have enthusiastically contributed to the National Salvation Donation. A reporter from the Shen Times News visited Mr. Du Yuesheng, Director of the National Salvation Donation Fundraising Committee of this city, to ask for his opinion on raising the National Salvation Donation. Mr. Du replied that since Japanese warships came to Shanghai to cause trouble, our government will not be threatened.

Resolutely Fight

For the past week, we have relied on our land and air soldiers to bravely win successive victories. The remnants of the enemy in the Hongkou area are about to be wiped out. The enemy's attempt to land in Pudong and Liuhang has also failed. A fierce battle is taking place at Nankou in North China, and the enemy has suffered heavy casualties. Shangdu has been recaptured by our army. A full-scale war has already begun. The fate of the survival of the Chinese nation depends on this time. Since the war has broken out, the need for material supplies is extremely important. All compatriots across the country should uphold the righteousness of contributing to national salvation.

Destroy Homes to Aid the Country

Enthusiastically contribute. At this time of national mobilization, it must be understood that the people's strength is the nation's strength. Now the national spirit of resistance against Japan has already been mobilized, but the national financial resources have not yet been fully manifested. At this critical moment, it is not necessary for the state to requisition all private property. Citizens should voluntarily fulfill their national duty to save the country. All compatriots in various places, except those who have been directly damaged by the war and have become refugees and should be rescued, should contribute as much as possible with their manpower and material resources. Since the establishment of this committee, the National Salvation Donation received from all parties has reached

Over One Million Yuan

Especially the working masses, who save every penny, are even more commendable. It is hoped that the general public above the producer level and wealthy families will be enthusiastic, be excited, and give generously. Then a huge amount of donations can be collected in a short time. The National Salvation Donation needs supplies, whether gold, silver, or goods, all are welcome. The National Salvation Donation received by this committee, in addition to respecting the wishes of the donors, who can specify the use, is all submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for unified allocation and control, so that the funds will not be wasted.

Effectively Utilized

The names and amounts of donors are published in the newspaper every day and reported to the Military Affairs Commission for record in stages. The goods donated by compatriots from all walks of life, such as gold and silver currency, gold and silver rings, ornaments, and utensils, are requested to be donated to the Laofengxiang Silver Store on Nanjing Road, the Baocheng Silver Store on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, and the Fang Jiuxia Silver Store in Xiaodongmen for collection. Currently, legal tender, bank deposit slips, bank drafts, promissory notes, government bonds, and checks from banks collecting donations can all be used as National Salvation Donations. If banks and money shops are

Closed for Holidays

The National Salvation Donation will still be accepted as usual. If you want to donate other items, securities, movable or immovable property, please contact this committee at the temporary office of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce first. The expenses required for the operation of this committee are raised separately and will never use the donations. Furthermore, recently the Ministry of Finance issued National Salvation Bonds, and the fundraising measures have been announced. Those who donate to the National Salvation Donation this time can hold the official receipt of this committee and go to the four banks of the Central, China, Communications, and China Farmers, the Postal Remittances Bureau, the Post Office, and other designated banks to exchange for the same amount of

National Salvation Bonds

If individuals or groups are willing to donate property for national salvation but do not want to receive National Salvation Bonds, their property can also be collected by various general fundraising agencies, but the receipts should indicate that they are voluntarily donating and will not exchange for bonds. This method is convenient for both public and private interests and is appropriate for the occasion. At this critical moment, compatriots across the country will surely compete to contribute their wealth to the country. Success or failure depends on this one action. On behalf of the colleagues of this committee, I express my opinions as above.

(Special Report from this Newspaper) For days, the remnants of the enemy in the Hongkou district of Shanghai East have been in dire straits and have had to seek new plans. On the one hand, the remnants of the enemy continue to resist stubbornly, and at the same time, they concentrate dozens of enemy ships and transports carrying two divisions of reinforcing enemy army, launching intensive artillery attacks on Wusong, Shizilin, Liuhang, Yanglinkou, and other places, attempting to cover the landing and attack our rear. For two days, the fiercest artillery battle has unfolded in Wusong, and the focus of the war has clearly shifted to the sea. Starting at 8 p.m. last night, the enemy flagship Izumo, leading more than ten enemy ships stationed in the Huangpu River, sailed to Wusong to join more than thirty enemy ships outside the port, launching a full-scale artillery attack on Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobing, Wusongkou, Shizilin, and other places. The artillery fire was thunderous and could be heard for hundreds of miles. Our garrison has a strong force and returned fire with heavy artillery. By midnight, a part of the enemy's reinforcements had landed stealthily under the cover of intensive artillery fire. Our army immediately swept them with machine guns, killing more than half. However, a small number of enemy soldiers, disregarding death, continued to land on all fronts. Our army rose up in hand-to-hand combat, and the fierce fighting was extremely intense. As of this afternoon, the landing enemy troops have been bravely repelled by our army, and sporadic remnants are being searched for.

(Special Report from this Newspaper) According to official sources, at dawn today, many Japanese ships, full of a large number of soldiers, landed stealthily at Zhanghuabang, Wusong, and Shizilin. The Japanese ships also fired heavy artillery to cover the landing. Our army responded calmly and repelled all the enemy troops after two hours of fierce fighting.

(Special Report from this Newspaper) On the Wusong front, due to the Japanese army's attempts to land, all enemy ships concentrated on the Wusong River last night and launched heavy artillery fire. We immediately returned fire with heavy artillery, and a fierce artillery battle unfolded between the two sides. The artillery fire has not ceased as of this morning. When the British destroyer HMS Dacha arrived this morning, the two sides were still engaged in artillery warfare. Due to the enemy ships gathering in Wusong, the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, according to an inspection report at 8 a.m. this morning, only three enemy destroyers were moored on the Huangpu River. The rest sailed to Wusong last night. The flagship Izumo was moored in the heart of the river east of Shanghai University in Yangshupu at 9 a.m. this morning and returned to a mooring opposite the Gonghexiang Wharf at 11 a.m. this afternoon.

At the same time, an enemy light cruiser in front of the Consulate and a destroyer of the First Detachment in front of the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf also left the Huangpu River and went to Wusong. More than ten Japanese ships in the Yangshupu section also secretly left Shanghai last night and went to Wusong. The Izumo first returned to Yangshupu this morning and then sailed back to a mooring in front of the Gonghexiang Wharf at 11:32 a.m. An enemy Destroyer No. 1 remains at the Garden Bridge.

### The Enemy Invades Baziqiao Three Times

First Harassment at 9:30 Last Night; The Enemy Suffers a Complete Retreat by Dawn

(Special Report from this Newspaper) Since our army occupied the Japanese Elementary School at Baziqiao, it has adopted a steady and solid strategy, intending to take the opportunity to attack the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Headquarters. The enemy is well aware of its predicament, but its ambition is still not dead, hoping to break through our lines. Every night, it must attack several times. At 9:30 last night, the enemy first harassed with infantry, fought for about an hour, and retreated in disarray. At 11 p.m., it launched a second attack, which was still repelled by our army. At 2 a.m. this morning, it launched a third attack, with a force of about one battalion. After our army bravely fought back, it still stubbornly resisted until dawn at 5 a.m., when the enemy finally failed and retreated with its remnants. Our lines did not move at all.

### Enemy Counterattack on Kangyuan Factory Fails

We Occupied the High Ground and Shot Down; The Enemy Suffered Heavy Casualties, with Sixty or Seventy Killed

(Special Report from this Newspaper) According to a certain gentleman who returned from the front line of Gaolangqiao, our army on Huade Road occupied the Kangyuan Can Factory three days ago, built defensive fortifications, and advanced steadily. However, at 11 p.m. last night, about 200 enemy soldiers advanced from the Pudong waterfront and launched a fierce offensive against our army at the Kangyuan Factory. When the two sides were about 100 meters apart, the enemy fired machine guns indiscriminately, mixed with small steel mortars, and the momentum was fierce. At that time, our army in the factory was already prepared and used dense machine guns to shoot down from the high ground. A part of our daredevil team rushed out and threw hand grenades accurately. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, with sixty or seventy killed, and retreated, abandoning corpses and armor.

### Our Planes Attack Huangpu Warships on a Moonlit Night

Several Bombs Were Dropped and They Flew Away Calmly; Foreigners Admire Our Pilot's Skills

(Special Report from this Newspaper) Last night the moonlight was bright. At about 11:00 p.m., our air force suddenly appeared over the Huangpu River, flying around and reconnoitering up and down the river and in various parts of Hongkou. The enemy ships in the Huangpu River were panicked and distraught, firing anti-aircraft guns wildly into the sky. The chaotic scene can be imagined. Our air force dropped several bombs and then flew away calmly, posing a great threat to the enemy. The foreign ships stationed in the Huangpu River witnessed the activity of our aircraft and admired the skills of our pilots.

### The U.S. Flagship Incident Has Ended

The Source of the Shell Still Cannot Be Proven; Ordered to Resolve Locally Without Protesting

(Special Report from this Newspaper) The U.S. Navy flagship Augusta, which was moored on the Bund, was hit by a stray shell on the deck at 6:30 p.m. on Friday, when Japanese ships in the Huangpu River were fighting our Pudong artillery, killing one sailor and injuring 18. The incident aroused considerable attention in various quarters. According to inquiries made by this newspaper's reporters to the parties concerned, Commander Yarnell of the ship consulted with Washington after the incident and thoroughly investigated the source of the stray shell. After two days of investigation, it still cannot be fully determined where the stray shell came from, nor can it be fully proven that it was fired by our side or the Japanese side. What is known is that this stray shell was of a small caliber. Therefore, apart from issuing a notice to both China and Japan, no protest has been lodged to date. At the same time, Washington does not want the situation to escalate and ordered that it be resolved locally. Therefore, according to officers of the ship, because the source of the stray shell cannot be fully proven, they do not want to lodge a protest. The unfortunate incident is also considered to be over, and the decision has been reported to the authorities in Washington. Currently, the injured sailors are being treated at the Marine Corps Hospital and are not in life-threatening danger. It is noted that on Thursday afternoon, our authorities notified foreign ships in the Huangpu River to leave the Japanese ships by five nautical miles, but British and American ships, believing that they were protecting the concessions, did not leave conspicuously.

### British Army Defenses North of the Bridge Are Consolidated

Sandbags Are Piled Up, Looking Like High Walls from Afar; Not Allowing Defeated Soldiers to Rush In

(Special Report from this Newspaper) This newspaper's reporters inspected the British army's defenses along the Suzhou River this afternoon, starting with the Garden Bridge. The British army's defenses on the bridge side were extremely tight. Several Western police officers were stationed on the bridge, keeping watch. Across the bridge, Japanese naval landing troops piled sandbags and stood guard, their attitude still calm. Vehicles with passes from both sides could pass freely. Ambulances of the Red Cross came and went frequently. Both the Garden Bridge and the North Sichuan Road Bridge were equipped with barbed wire, completely blocking traffic. From a distance, the Japanese naval landing troops on the other side of the river were running around transporting supplies, extremely busy. Japanese soldiers were stationed on all floors of the Post Office, and they frequently poked their heads out of the windows to look around. The Tianfei Temple Bridge is also open as usual today. The reporter took a car across the bridge directly to the end of North Henan Road and walked to the iron gate of the concession leading to Binshan Road. From a distance, our military police stood upright in the center of the street, calm and composed. Usually, only the rumbling of planes circling overhead could be heard. Apart from that, the two armies faced each other in silence. Along North Jiangxi Road, the British army had piled up extremely high sandbags, looking like high walls from afar, not allowing defeated soldiers to rush in. The defenses were indeed exceptionally solid. The British troops stationed north of the Tianfei Temple Bridge were all newly arrived British infantry, spirited and approachable. The British soldiers stationed in front of the iron gate at the end of North Henan Road, who witnessed the fierce fighting between the two armies, praised the bravery and agility of our army's operations.

### Our Soldiers Rescue Swiss Merchants from Danger

Trapped Under Artillery Fire for Twenty-Four Hours, Walking Back to Residence via Jiangwan, etc.

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) The two Swiss siblings, employees of the Swiss company Wing Chong & Co., trapped in the godown on Chao Feng Road, were attempted to be rescued by the Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai the night before last, but he returned without success due to being unable to pass through Hongkou. Yesterday afternoon, with the assistance of our troops, the two Swiss siblings safely escaped and returned to their residence, expressing their deep gratitude for the hospitality of our soldiers. They recounted their escape as follows: the brother and sister were trapped under artillery fire and rain of bullets for a total of twenty hours. They took refuge in the godown at 4:00 PM on Friday, but the artillery fire had already arrived, so they could not leave. The surrounding area of the godown was engaged in fierce fighting all night on Friday. At around 6:00 PM, they once attempted to flee towards Broadway Road, but the surrounding area was on fire, and thick smoke obscured their vision, forcing them to return to the godown. They waited anxiously for dawn, and glimpsed a Chinese soldier from the window, to whom they called for help. This Chinese soldier rescued them. The brother and sister intended to wave white cloths to pass through the front line, but the fire and smoke were overwhelming and extremely dangerous. Therefore, they were still escorted by this soldier to the rear of our army, passing through Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Zhenru, and then walking to Jessfield Road, passing through the park and returning. They arrived in Shanghai at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. The brother and sister were extremely grateful to our soldiers for protecting their safety. In the rear, they were lent dark clothes to avoid being targeted for bombing. Along the way, they were protected by our army. Yesterday, the Swiss Consul-General expressed his deep gratitude to Mayor Yu.

### Italian Gunboat Withdraws from Nanshi

Failed to Withdraw During Blockade, Released This Afternoon After Request

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) At the beginning of the Shanghai battle, in order to consolidate the rear defense, our military authorities implemented a blockade of the upper reaches of the Huangpu River. Unexpectedly, a small Italian gunboat failed to withdraw in time and was blockaded near the Yitaihing Wharf in Nanshi. It has been unable to sail out since then. The Italian Consul-General in Shanghai repeatedly requested Mayor Yu Hongjun, and only this morning did he obtain Mayor Yu's permission. However, Mayor Yu solemnly stated to the Italian Consul that if the ship must leave the blockade line, our side would not be responsible for any accidents that may occur as a result. The Italian Consul expressed his agreement. The ship withdrew at 1:00 PM this afternoon, escorted by our navy and river patrol ships. At the same time, the space that was only left open in the blockade line was completely closed to secure the river defense.

### Tragic Bombing at Intersection of Rising Sun Building This Afternoon

Hundreds Dead and Wounded, Sincere and Wing On Suffered Extremely Heavy Damage, Surrounding Shops Affected

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) At 12:56 PM this afternoon, at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, the most prosperous area of the Public Concession, and the intersection of the Rising Sun Building tramway, a replay of the Grand World tragedy occurred. There was a loud bang that shook the sky. Our reporter immediately rushed to the scene to investigate. All that could be seen was dead and wounded all over the ground, blood and flesh blurred. The number of casualties was still being rescued when this publication went to press, so there was no exact number yet, but it was at least several hundred.

The most severely damaged were the two major companies, Sincere and Wing On, which stood opposite each other. The buildings along the road were heavily damaged. Dead and wounded were everywhere on the east and west sides of that section of Nanjing Road, north and south of Zhejiang Road, as well as on Hubei Road, the Rising Sun Building, Shen Dacheng, and Yileitian Tea House. An Indian policeman directing traffic was also blown to death on the iron frame kiosk. Many vehicles were destroyed. The glass windows of shops in the vicinity were all blown out. The new glass windows on all sides of the 22-story building of Wing On Company were completely destroyed. The misery of the situation was evident. At that time, the Public Concession's International Settlement Volunteer Corps, British soldiers, fire brigade, various volunteer rescue organizations, and various hospitals were immediately dispatched to rescue and treat the dead and wounded, sending them to various hospitals for treatment. Regarding the source of the bombs, according to eyewitnesses, when two enemy heavy bombers flew over Nanjing Road, they first strafed twice with machine guns, and then dropped a bomb. The police are currently conducting a strict investigation.

### Japanese Reinforcements on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway

[Nanjing] According to transportation circles, the Japanese army is currently reinforcing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. More than a thousand enemy troops occupying the southern suburbs of Tianjin traveled south along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the morning of the 22nd. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Short Commentary

— Xiang

It is customary in international affairs. When two countries go to war, they must first issue an ultimatum. The ambassadors of the two countries lower their flags and return home before the war begins. Now our ambassador to Japan is still in Japan. The Japanese ambassador, Kawagoe, is still in Shanghai. However, the artillery fire has been raging for nearly a month (after the firing in Tianjin and Peking). The god of war has been descending for a long time, but the door to peace is never closed. This is also a new plan in the history of modern warfare.

According to a Tokyo telegram on the 20th, the Japanese cabinet decided to prepare for a long-term war, which is a very strange thing. During the January 28th Incident, Japan planned to resolve the 19th Route Army in a few hours. Unexpectedly, the fighting lasted for more than a month before our army retreated completely. Now, in a full-scale war, I wonder when the Japanese side plans to end it? There must be a decision in advance. Why is there talk of a long-term war? However, with daily military expenses of 17 million yuan, plus unexpected losses of aircraft and warships, it would be too uneconomical to continue for a long time, right? Furthermore, will the Japanese people allow it?

### Front Line of the Beijing-Hankou Railway (Continued)

— Xi Min

Under the planned and gradual offensive of the enemy, we are responding locally without planning or steps. The outcome of victory is obvious. What is regrettable is that the brave soldiers of the 29th Army were too let down. Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao resistance, there has been no organization of field hospitals and rear hospitals. Late at night on July 29th, thousands of brothers of the 29th Army, supporting the wounded soldiers in the front, retreated step by step to the outside of Baoding City. They had not eaten anything for two days and two nights of arduous resistance. They lay sprawled on the muddy ground of the city gate all day long, and the groans of the wounded soldiers and the unbearable hunger in their stomachs forced them to issue heavy and indignant roars. Without reception centers, without assistance, the suffering of sacrificing for the country in this way, although brave and patriotic men will never be discouraged, we always feel a heavy sense of shame in our conscience. Fortunately, through the efforts of the government and Mr. Feng Zhian, the wounded soldiers who were injured for the country now have rear hospitals for recuperation, and the brothers who have returned from hundreds of battles have also been reorganized and are ready. In the near future, we will definitely see the efforts of our brave 29th Army soldiers to kill the enemy again on the national defense line. Mr. Feng Zhian recently told people in Bao that "the past environment was complicated, with too many considerations. Now all the problems have been simplified. In the future, we will just obey the central government, and the central government can do whatever it wants." The reason why the resistance against Japan in North China suffered setbacks was because of "a complicated environment and too many considerations," but I hope that the whole country will be united in the future and move towards one goal. Although Pingjin has fallen, it is not impossible to see a ray of hope after disappointment to completely change the deformed situation in North China in one fell swoop!

In this war of resistance against Japan in North China, the most glorious harvest is not only the loyalty and bravery of the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army in defending the country, but also the resolute defection of the puppet security team in Tongxian under the leadership of Mr. Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian, their arduous and bloody battle with the enemy, and the bloody battle of the security team under the leadership of Mr. Shi Yousan and the militia of Sun Dianying's troops in the Beiyuan area, all of which were glorious in the history of national liberation. Although their sacrifices were so cruel that people couldn't bear to look at them, because of their defection and bloody battles, the world and the invaders were clearly told that the Chinese nation is, after all, a whole, and the Chinese nation has, after all, awakened. Mr. Shi Yousan gave a very solemn speech to his troops. He said to his subordinates, "In the past, we wore dog skins, but now we have officially changed into Chinese clothes!"

Our reporter went to the front line of Liulihe on the 7th to inspect and interviewed the stationed troops on the front line. Because the soldiers of the 29th Army had been through a long period of bloody battles, they needed to take a short period of rest and reorganization, so the defense of the Pinghan Front had already been taken over by a certain unit of fresh troops. The senior generals and brothers we contacted on the front line, their determination and confidence in resisting the enemy, made us so excited that we wanted to shed tears. Commander Feng, who was stationed on the front line, told the reporter that when their troops were selecting plainclothes teams, the brothers in each unit scrambled to sign up, and the number of people who signed up exceeded the original quota by more than two times. Also, several service soldiers and orderlies in a certain unit automatically requested their superiors to allow them to go to the front line to kill the enemy. They were unwilling to give up the most enjoyable opportunity in this great opportunity to serve the country. A few days ago, our plainclothes team was very active around Liangxiang City. The enemy troops inside Liangxiang City closed the city gates tightly and were afraid to take a step beyond the boundaries.

However, the lives of these many patriotic brothers are too painful. They get only seven and a half yuan a month, and food costs more than six yuan a month. What is left is not even enough to buy a pair of necessary cloth shoes. The soldiers on the front line do not want a luxurious life. They hope that the mass organizations in the rear who are helping the war effort will provide more daily necessities such as shoes, socks, and towels. As for masks and medicines against poison gas, they are naturally even more welcome. We hope that the comrades in the rear support associations in various places will pay attention to this. The reporter also interviewed Mr. Wang Lengzhai, who had been defending Wanping for more than twenty days. Mr. Wang will probably be in charge of entertaining guests from various places at the Hebei Provincial Government in the future, so he specially told the reporter that he hoped that the organization of comfort groups from various places would not have too many representatives. With too many representatives, it would be extremely difficult to entertain them on the battlefield. Mr. Wang's meaning is also to be noted by everyone here.

### Fierce Air Battle Over Zhenjiang and Yangzhou

Our Planes Valiantly Surround the Enemy in Four Routes, Shooting Down Six Enemy Bombers in Succession

Zhenjiang Telegraph, Since the beginning of the gun battle, the enemy has continuously attacked our capital for days. Our air defense authorities have prevented them from forcing their way into the capital. At around 10:00 AM on the 16th, more than ten enemy planes again attacked in several teams, engaging in a fierce battle with our air force over Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. As a result, six enemy planes were shot down by our planes one after another, and the rest fled in embarrassment. At around 5:00 PM, the enemy sent more than twenty planes to scout. Several planes were discovered over Zhenjiang. Seeing that our side was tightly guarded, they feared being attacked by us again, so they fled in all directions. The details of the annihilation of the enemy are as follows:

Details of Enemy Planes Shot Down in Zhenjiang

At around 10:00 AM on the 16th, the local air defense authorities received news that enemy planes were coming and immediately began a citywide alert. Our planes also took off to scout in the air. At around 11:00 AM, they encountered six enemy planes between Jurong and Zhenjiang, engaging in fierce fighting for a while. Two planes were shot down by our planes, and the remaining four fled in embarrassment. Our planes pursued them to the air over the Fifth District of Zhenjiang, and as a result, another plane was shot down. Another plane that fled to the Third District of Lishui was shot down by our fighter plane. Our pilots, Second Lieutenant Benji and team member Wu Dingchen, landed safely. At 11:55 AM, according to a report from the Security Regiment, an enemy plane crashed on the Beicheng Town in the Fifth District. At 3:50 PM, the regiment reported again that two more enemy planes were found to have been shot down more than 20 li south of Dagang. Upon hearing the news, the reporter immediately took a car to Kuaicheng to inspect. The car arrived next to Bridge No. 3, sixteen kilometers away (between Ding and Beicheng). He parked and walked into a small village, about two Chinese li away, belonging to Huashan Township in the Fifth District. From afar, he saw the red sun-shaped wings of the Japanese national emblem, lying huge in the rice field, like a dead pelican. The fuselage and corpses were scattered all over the ground. When the reporter arrived at the crash site, many villagers were watching. The nose and fuselage were smashed and exploded, covering an area of more than 100 meters. Next to the plane were seven corpses, none of them intact. The commander of the plane had a saber, leather boots, and a business card on his body, which read "Japanese Navy Lieutenant Umemura Takatsugu." The plane was a Mitsubishi No. 27 manufactured Type 96 land-based engine-changing heavy bomber, with the month and year code 96-12-18, belonging to the Kanoya Air Group, worth about 400,000 to 500,000 Japanese yen. The dead had superstitious amulets such as Buddhist names on their bodies. It is said that there were seven dead, one commander, three gunners, one pilot, one assistant, and one telegraph operator. According to villagers who witnessed it, at around 11:00 AM, six planes flew from the sky over Dagang, three flying above and three below, chasing each other. The sound of gunfire crackled. One plane immediately crashed. A person on the plane jumped with a parachute, but still fell to his death. At that time, there was a loud crash, flames soared, and smoke filled the air. Two planes fled to the east. The wreckage of the plane has now been transported by the military authorities to Zhenjiang by truck and displayed at the Provincial People's Education Center, so that the public can gain more knowledge of air defense.

Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses in the Air Battle of Yangzhou

At 11:10 AM on the 16th, taking advantage of the cloudy weather, three twin-engine heavy bombers suddenly descended from the clouds between Shuangqiao and Qilidian, dropping three bombs. They were then surrounded by seven of our planes near the Slender West Lake and Ping Shan Tang. The two sides strafed with machine guns. After half an hour, two enemy planes fled in embarrassment, and the remaining plane, under the two hours of encirclement, also fled with heavy damage. It is said that it crashed near Zhuang Wang Temple. The morale of our side in this battle was unusually stable. At the moment, many of our planes are constantly scouting in the sky over the city. After the air force achieved victory, Teng Yizhai, Chang Shi Zhi, Zhu Li Sun, and others, standing members of the county chamber of commerce, feeling grateful to our air force for their courage to resist the enemy and their remarkable achievements, specially purchased a large number of biscuits, beef, milk, and other items in the afternoon, and sent them to the pilots at the airfield to comfort them.

The volunteer police investigation team and others were dispatched in full force.

On the 9th, the Jiangnian Police Station discovered nine suspects selling Jintan and escorted them to the county government for interrogation.

### How Many Traitors Are There?

Three More Arrested in Pudong

In recent days, many traitors have been arrested in the Pudong area. Three more were arrested yesterday, all of whom were ignorant coolies who were used by the enemy as guides for bombing by enemy planes. This morning, an official from the local security group told the reporter that it was found that every time enemy planes flew over, there was a sharp, strange whistle heard from the ground. It must have been used by the traitors as a signal. Our army has been notified to strictly arrest and deal with them.

### Jianghai Customs Is at a Standstill

Due to the suspension of incoming and outgoing ships, the Jianghai Customs is extremely quiet. Especially the import and export offices under the General Affairs Section, because no one is reporting customs declarations, are in a state of desolation. However, the customs officers, from Tax Commissioner Rhodes to the lower ranks, still sign in and work as usual. Although there are tax police stationed at the gate facing the river, many family members of the customs staff are entering or sitting on the bottom floor, and the scene is extremely bleak.

### Automatic Donation of Ornaments, Two Locations Worth 20,000 Yuan

Since the Shanghai Municipal National Salvation Donation Committee began soliciting donations of gold, silver, and other items for national salvation, all sectors have responded enthusiastically. It is learned that the Laofengxiang Silver Building, a collection point on Nanjing Road, has received a large number of ornaments since the 16th, but the total has not yet been tallied. The total value is estimated to be about 11,000 yuan, with silver utensils being the most numerous, followed by rings and other ornaments. Also, the Baochang Silver Building on Avenue Edward VII has received an estimated value of over 5,000 yuan in donated ornaments as of today. Silverware such as silver tripods and shields are the most numerous, and gold ornaments such as rings are the most numerous. Yesterday, someone even sent in two gold teeth, which was especially commendable.

### Nanshi Patrol

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) This morning, our reporter made a detailed patrol of various places in Nanshi. The scenes witnessed were much calmer than in previous days. Except that the security situation has not been relaxed at all, the streets were bustling with people, as usual. Most of the shops have opened and are operating as usual. Traffic has gradually returned. The iron shed at Laobeimen in the French Concession is unblocked. The number of passengers at Nanshi Station has been reduced to less than usual. The shops in the vicinity are all open, with no wartime state at all. At 9:55 AM, five enemy planes flew over the station, but the citizens did not pay attention, as they were used to it and did not find it strange. However, the larger firms along the Bund and Zhongma Road were still tightly closed. The vermilion couplets on both sides reminded one of the Lunar New Year.

### Central Relief Committee Allocates One Million to Relief

Divided into Five Routes to Relief War Zone Refugees

[Nanjing] The Central Relief Committee has allocated one million, divided into five routes, to provide relief to war zone refugees. ㊀ The Nanjing-Shanghai Route is divided into three zones: 1. The Songhu Zone, where the Relief Committee will send personnel to jointly organize a design committee with the Shanghai Charity Federation, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters to plan everything, and Wang Yiting and others are recommended to start rescue operations and set up shelters and provide funds. There are currently 300,000 to 400,000 refugees in Shanghai. 2. The Suzhou-Zhenjiang Zone, where more refugees have come to Suzhou from Shanghai to the west, and most of them are walking. The committee previously sent Commissioner Cheng Jingsheng to serve as the Suzhou-Zhenjiang Zone's special rescue commissioner, and he is working to contact local gentry. 3. The Capital Zone. In the capital, due to the tight air defense, enemy aircraft rarely intrude, but the committee has also made considerable preparations. In case of emergency, it will do its best to rescue and ensure the safety of the people. ㊁ The Tianjin-Pukou Route is divided into two zones: the Tianjin-Cangzhou Zone and the Cangzhou-Xuzhou Zone. After Tianjin was invaded, the people suffered terribly. The committee has telegraphed the Tianjin gentry to handle the matter on its behalf. It is reported that although the number of people received is large and the amount of money raised is also large, the refugees do not feel any difficulty in terms of food and clothing. At present, Yunnan Baiyao is urgently needed. There are also many refugees in the Cangzhou to Xuzhou section, who escaped from Jinghai, Tianjin to Cangzhou, and are proceeding to Dezhou and other places. It has repeatedly received reports from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau that three to four thousand people escape every day. Cui Jingchun has now been sent with funds to provide relief. ㊂ The Ping-Sui Route, where there are many refugees on this route in the Nankou area, most of whom are fleeing to the west or southwest to the Shanxi area. Those who cannot escape from Nankou to Beiping are subjected to cruel labor by the Japanese. The committee has sent two commissioners, Yang and Sun, to engage in relief work. ㊃ The Ping-Han Route, where the refugees are fleeing from the north, Tang Zongguo, a standing committee member, has gone to liaise with local governments along the route to find ways to relocate and provide food. If their families are in the south, they will be sent back to their hometowns. ㊄ The Jiaoji Route, which runs across eastern Shandong, is also a vital military area. The Japanese army is constantly challenging in Qingdao. The committee has already made preparations and appointed Zhou Baipeng to go to arrange the matter within days. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)

### Health Bureau Cracks Down on Speculation in Antigas Medicine

Recently, the war has been intense, and our army has been winning victories. The general public, in view of the Japanese army's disregard for international law, is deeply concerned about the release of poison gas, so they have been actively preparing for poison gas prevention. However, some cunning merchants and unscrupulous doctors are speculating and profiting by selling antigas pills and powders. It must be known that poison gas prevention must use airtight masks and effective filter canisters (priced at fifteen yuan and six yuan and five jiao in two types. The Rongshou Guomin Chemistry Industry Company on Six Ma Road in this city has wholesale sales. For blistering gases, it is also necessary to wear antigas clothing, gloves, and shoes and hats (about eighty yuan per set). As for so-called antigas medicine, those prepared according to established formulas are more reliable, but their effectiveness is weak and temporary, only enough to provide more than ten minutes of gas prevention in a toxic area, or for use when passing through a poisonous gas zone. Antigas medicine that is not prepared according to effective formulas, and antigas pills, powders, and effervescent agents sold by unofficial pharmaceutical factories, have not been scientifically proven. To say that they can prevent poison gas after use is simply nonsense. The city's health bureau has cracked down on them separately, and notified all citizens not to purchase them at will to avoid wasting money, which will not help in practice and will leave endless harm. Moreover, the release of poison gas must take into account the terrain, wind force, and battlefield conditions. Shanghai is a coastal area with much rain and wind, and is also the location of foreign nationals from various countries, with all eyes watching. If the enemy releases poison gas, it will definitely arouse the public anger of various countries and jointly attack the stubborn public enemy. It is hoped that citizens will not panic themselves. If they want to prepare themselves, they should purchase accurate gas masks. As for those who are limited by their finances and only purchase reliable antigas medicine, they should also prepare special masks, or make gauze masks themselves, and prepare degreased gauze for use. Also, regardless of whether it is an accurate gas mask or antigas medicine, you should leave the toxic area immediately after wearing it.

### Sufficient Food Supply in the Northern District

But Fuel Purchase Is Difficult

After a certain rice store at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road in the northern district was designated as the exclusive seller of rice, residents in the district no longer have to worry about food. However, the purchase of fuel is now very difficult. Because none of the firewood and charcoal shops on various roads have opened, households that want to buy firewood and charcoal every day are sighing that they have money but cannot buy it. It is hoped that the industry will open as soon as possible to avoid residents running out of fuel.

### Westerners Witness the Enemy's Brutal and Bestial Acts

Slaughtering Our Innocent People - The Cruel Situation Is Hair-Raising

The Nagasaki Maru, which arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and the Shanghai Maru, which arrived in Shanghai, were both docked somewhere. Many Westerners came to Shanghai on the ship. They all witnessed the Japanese army in that place successively using sharp knives to attack our innocent people, regardless of whether they were dead or not, and throwing them into the Huangpu River. All the Westerners who saw this kind of brutal and bestial behavior of the Japanese army were filled with indignation and denounced them as the most barbaric nation.

The North-China Daily News said that twenty foreigners who were avoiding the heat in Japan returned to Chaopu yesterday on the Shanghai Maru and witnessed a barbaric and tragic event. When the ship went to the Wayside Wharf, they saw four Chinese kneeling at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha Wharf, with their hands tied behind their backs. There were soldiers with bayonets on their rifles standing behind them, stabbing them one by one with bayonets all over their bodies, and then throwing their corpses into the Huangpu River. The Japanese soldiers claimed that these four people were snipers.
