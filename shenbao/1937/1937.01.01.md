The court opened at 10:00 AM on the 31st at the Commission, and the trial and verdict were rendered immediately.

The full text of the verdict is recorded below:

Military Affairs Commission Higher Military Court Verdict

Verdict: Defendant Zhang Xueliang,

The defendant listed above, for the case of violence and coercion against a superior officer, has been tried by the Higher Military Court organized by this Commission, and the verdict is as follows:

Main Text

Zhang Xueliang, as the chief instigator and accomplice, committed violence and coercion against a superior officer, is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment with reduction, and deprivation of civil rights for five years.

Facts

In December of the 25th year of the Republic of China, this Committee member, fearing Chiang Kai-shek, went from Luoyang to Shaanxi on official business and stayed in Lintong. At dawn on the 12th, Zhang Xueliang led his troops to intercept and hold him in Xi'an, forcing Chairman Chiang to accept his demands for reorganizing the government. At that time, Central Committee member Shao Yuanchong, Third Group Leader of the Adjutant's Office Jiang Xiaoxian, Secretary Xiao Naihua, and many other adjutant staff and guards who accompanied the delegation to Shaanxi on official business, as well as Yang Zhenya, the head of the Shaanxi Gendarmerie Regiment, were killed when they resisted. Qian Dajun, the director of the Adjutant's Office, was also shot and wounded. Furthermore, senior officials in Shaanxi, including Chen Diaoyuan, Jiang Zuobin, Zhu Shaoliang, Shao Lizi, Jiang Dingwen, Chen Cheng, Wei Lihuang, Chen Jicheng, and Wan Yaohuang, were all detained. Zhang Xueliang was often reprimanded by Chairman Chiang, and soon repented. On the 25th of the same month, he accompanied Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing to plead guilty. After the incident first occurred, the National Government ordered this Commission to handle the case strictly. Now, Zhang Xueliang's plea of guilt has been received by this Commission. After the Higher Military Court was organized and the trial concluded, the facts are determined as above.

Reasons

The defendant in this case, Zhang Xueliang, led troops to intercept and hold the commander-in-chief, forcing him to accept his demands for reorganizing the government. This is evidenced by the defendant's telegrams. The killing of officials and detention of generals are all public facts. Although these actions were carried out by his subordinates, it is clear that the defendant was the instigator and should bear the responsibility for the crime. His actions constitute offenses under Article 67, Section 2, first part of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, Article 271, Section 1 and Section 2, and Article 302, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. However, considering that the crimes he committed were a single act that violated multiple criminal charges, or that the method and result of committing one crime violated other criminal charges, Article 15 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and Article 55 of the Criminal Law should be invoked to apply the heavier punishment from Article 67, Section 2, first part of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law. However, the defendant, after being reprimanded by Chairman Chiang, showed repentance and accompanied him back to Nanjing to plead guilty. Considering his circumstances, he is not entirely unforgivable. Therefore, in accordance with Article 59 of the Criminal Law, the punishment under Article 67, Section 2, first part of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law is reduced to ten years of imprisonment. In accordance with Article 37, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, he is deprived of civil rights for five years. This is the verdict as stated in the main text. December 31st, 25th year of the Republic of China. Military Affairs Commission Higher Military Court. Presiding Judge: Li Liejun. Judges: Zhu Peide, Lu Zhonglin. Military Legal Officers: Chen Enpu, Qiu Yuqin. Clerk: Yuan Zuxian. Recorder: Guo Zuomin. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek learned of the verdict of the Military Court on Zhang Xueliang's case on the 31st, considering that the legal aspects had already been mitigated as much as possible according to the provisions of the law, there was no further room for leniency. However, given Zhang Xueliang's sincere repentance, courage to reform, and respect for the nation in surrendering himself for punishment, his situation was indeed pitiable. Therefore, he immediately submitted a petition to the National Government requesting a special pardon and asking that he be ordered to atone for his crimes through meritorious service. The petition was delivered to the National Government at 2:00 PM. The original petition is excerpted below: Petition for a Petition. It is humbly submitted that the Xi'an Incident was caused by Zhang Xueliang, the Deputy Commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression, who was misled by others and lightly violated national laws and regulations, engaging in reckless actions. Afterward, he felt awe of virtue and authority and suddenly realized his mistakes. He personally went to the capital to submit a written plea of guilt. The esteemed government ordered the Military Affairs Commission to assess the situation according to the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and impose a sentence of ten years of imprisonment. The law has been fully applied, and the crime and punishment are appropriate. The lenient reduction in punishment already demonstrates magnanimity. As I, Zhongzheng, am burdened with guilt, I dare not make any further entreaties. However, I believe that when discussing matters, one should pursue the utmost, and when enforcing the law, one should not neglect the application of benevolence. The state establishes criminal laws to deter the wicked and establish principles to await repentance. This time, the official was deluded and greatly violated the criminal code. News of the incident spread, and the entire nation was outraged. If he were to continue in his wickedness and stubbornly repeat his perverse actions, the state would not hesitate to punish him, but the nation's vitality would be further depleted. Fortunately, he quickly returned from the wrong path and repented in time. Observing his tearful confession to me personally, I know that his conscience was aroused, and he still values the nation. Due to a shift in his thoughts, he reversed the fate of the entire situation. Considering the original circumstances, it seems appropriate to seek a pardon. Today, the nation faces many difficulties, and there is an urgent need for talented individuals to stabilize the situation. The official is young and strong and has long been in the military. Through this grave mistake, he should gain a thorough understanding. If he is given a chance to redeem himself, it is hoped that he can still contribute. It seems unwise to abandon him outright and not provide an opportunity for improvement. In the past, our Premier punished chaos and hated evil, strictly enforcing the law, but he also pardoned transgressions and practiced benevolence, showing even greater tolerance. The Central Government's compassion for the guilty should further move the world. Therefore, without fear of blame, I offer my humble opinion, respectfully requesting the esteemed government to consider the official's courage to repent, strict adherence to national laws, and self-submission to punishment. Based on the Provisional Constitution, may benevolence be extended further, granting a special pardon for the crimes the official should receive and ordering him to atone for his crimes through meritorious service, striving for self-redemption, looking forward to future effects, and demonstrating exceptional benevolence. Whether this is feasible, a document is prepared and respectfully submitted for your review and implementation. Respectfully presented to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek respectfully presented. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Proclamation to the Nation from the Central Propaganda Department

The New Year's Day of the 26th year holds a uniquely grand and new significance; henceforth, we shall advance along the two paths of self-reliance and the eradication of bandits and traitors.

[Nanjing] The full text of the New Year's Day proclamation to all comrades and compatriots, issued by the Central Propaganda Department in the twenty-sixth year, is recorded below: Today marks the twenty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and also coincides with the return to Nanjing of our Party leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, after his ordeal. In recent days, the ardent enthusiasm of our people for rejoicing and comfort, and the grand scenes of celebrations and odes from various regions, are truly unprecedented in historical records. From now on, the Republic of China, which we have created with such hardship, is akin to surviving a calamity and seeing the light of day again. At the beginning of this year, we usher in boundless hope. The joy is extraordinary. Therefore, this year's New Year's Day, in addition to the customary celebrations, holds a uniquely grand and new significance. Recalling the past year, the country's path was fraught with difficulties, and there was no peaceful day. As the year drew to a close, the Xi'an Incident occurred. Fortunately, public opinion was aroused, and, inspired by the personality and sincerity of our leader, the Central Government's response and decision to quell the unrest was appropriate. With the loyal and courageous efforts of armed comrades, the great calamity was quelled in less than half a month. The leader of the Party and the nation, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, safely returned amidst the nation's love and the world's admiration. Even the instigators of the initial rebellion deeply expressed their sincerity in repenting and awaited punishment. The dark clouds were swept away. Therefore, our people are encouraged and joyful to celebrate this annual New Year's Day, and no one can restrain themselves. The incident on December 12th of last year was indeed a matter of life and death for our nation's five-thousand-year history, a turning point for the survival of the Republic of China, and a watershed in the character of our nation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has already spoken of this with great emotion in his address. The course of this incident is sufficient to prove that the foundation of our national unity is indeed solid, that the collective strength of the entire nation has indeed taken shape, and that the concern of our compatriots for national affairs and their support for the leader of our Party are also recognized by the world. In particular, our leader's benevolent and great personality, his steadfast and calm spirit in responding to the crisis, and his dedication to serving the country for more than a decade have become even clearer and more evident to the world. Tracing back to the decades of revolution by our Party, the reason we have braved countless dangers and overcome countless difficulties is none other than this consistent spirit, which has brought us to this day. All the dangers and difficulties in the revolutionary process have not been enough to shake our Party's unwavering belief and the great cause built by our leader with diligence. Even those who have turned against us have ultimately had to submit to the judgment of our Party's justice, the leader's personality, and the nation's public opinion. Our leader's sincerity, even the advocacy of the Red bandits could not obstruct, the coercion of enemy bullets could not deter, the cunning schemes of traitors could not implement, and the unusual actions of rebels could not bend. This further provides a firm and definite proof. We firmly believe that the hidden dangers within the country will henceforth be eliminated (at the same time, all the misleading statements that attempt to confuse people's minds and shake the foundation of the nation will also collapse without being attacked and disappear without being refuted. Under the interaction of our Party's justice and national consciousness, there is no reason for any conspiracy or unusual action to succeed by chance, as can be seen from this incident. We further believe that the greatest crisis for the nation has been safely overcome, that the revival and construction of a new China can proceed smoothly, and that our nation's self-confidence has become even stronger and deeper. At this grand festival, as we reflect on the past and look forward to the future, we respectfully present the paths of our common efforts in the future, in order to encourage our comrades and to look forward to mutual encouragement with our compatriots throughout the country.

In the future, the work of our Party will resolutely advance along the following paths. On the active front, we must unite internal forces to consolidate the foundation of unity, rectify discipline to establish the pattern of the rule of law, and cultivate national strength to engage in the preparation for restoration. In a word, it is "self-reliance." On New Year's Day last year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced to the people the way of saving the country by saving ourselves, saying, "As long as the people of the whole country can strengthen their national self-confidence and truly become self-reliant and strong, our country will surely be restored." Over the past year, the Central Government's domestic measures have all been based on the above principles and have been universally recognized by the people. As for the way to achieve this, on the one hand, we must continue to vigorously implement the New Life Movement so that the moral spirit of our country can be nurtured and implemented in daily life, including clothing, food, housing, and habits, to establish the personality of the entire nation and create a new life for the people. On the other hand, we must strive to promote the National Economic Construction Movement to develop the people's ability to create and labor, increase the resources of the people's lives, thereby improve the people's economic life, and complete the material construction of the country. The former focuses on the spirit, and the latter focuses on material matters. The two complement each other and cannot be abandoned. If both sides can advance together and strive tirelessly, the national strength will be enriched, and the national restoration can be expected soon. Secondly, the most important task on the passive front is to intensify the planned work of eliminating bandits and traitors to eliminate the source of domestic unrest. Regarding this, our Party has repeatedly and earnestly informed the people of the country. Today, the existence of Red bandits in China cannot be tolerated, which is a universally recognized iron rule. As for the traitors who recognize the enemy as their father and are willing to be accomplices, they are still on the list to be eliminated, so there is no need to explain further. Therefore, we must eradicate their roots to unify the national steps of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country. In summary, the way to save the country and seek survival today lies in using the collective strength of the entire nation to consolidate the unity of the country internally and to seek the country's survival, freedom, and equality externally. At this time of reversal, all our people must be diligent and vigilant and must not be complacent for a moment. If we can exhaust the wisdom and talent of our four hundred million people to work together towards the great mission of saving the country and seeking survival, then the achievements in the future will surely surpass any country and any nation. This is what we must deeply recognize at the turning point from danger to safety and from weakness to strength.

Now, the border troubles are intensifying, the remnant bandits have not been pacified, and difficulties are everywhere. It is not yet the time for our people to fully celebrate. It is hoped that from now on, the entire country will concentrate its strength, unify its steps, and move towards the above-mentioned paths together, so that our country can become a bright and splendid modern country, and that our people can cultivate a happy and lively national character. This is not only the fortune of the people but also the fortune of the Party and the country.

(1) Eliminate internal traitors and resist foreign aggression. In recent years, foreign forces have been invading, and the situation has worsened. Resisting foreign aggression and seeking survival has become a unanimous understanding throughout the country. However, if the national traitors are not eliminated, the collective strength of the national struggle cannot be formed. Today's puppet Manchukuo traitors and the remaining Red bandits all want to collude with foreign forces to realize their wild ambitions and endanger the country. Their intentions are all the worst of national traitors. Therefore, we must eradicate their roots to solidify the internal foundation of the nation. Ensuring internal security is the way to resist foreign aggression, and eliminating traitors is the way to defend against foreign aggression. The recent Xi'an Incident further proves the correctness of this theory. Therefore, suppressing the Red bandits and eliminating internal traitors is the key to saving the country at present. At the same time, we must also resist the harassment of bandits and puppets with all our strength to secure our borders. This requires our comrades and compatriots throughout the country to work together, encourage each other, and support the government's promotion.

(2) Fulfilling responsibilities and completing construction. The fundamental belief in saving the country lies in self-reliance. The concrete realization of self-reliance lies in completing the construction of both spiritual and material aspects. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said, "We must use the New Life Movement to lay the foundation of the country's moral and spiritual foundation, and at the same time, we must use the National Economic Construction Movement to complete the country's economic construction." He also said, "As long as everyone does what they can do, strengthens themselves tirelessly, no matter how critical the country is, it can be saved within a year." These words are indeed true. If our compatriots throughout the country can each hold a sincere heart to save the country, deeply understand their own responsibilities, follow Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, follow their duties, practice what they preach, and devote their loyalty and knowledge to their assigned duties, then the great cause of restoration can be achieved, and the revival of national fortune is not far away.

(3) Concentrating will and unifying steps. The work of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country must first unify the will of the whole country, concentrate the strength of the whole country, accept the guidance of the Central Government, adhere to consistent views, be well-coordinated, and make every effort to succeed. Otherwise, indecision will lead to chaos and failure. For a year, the internal unity of our Party has been solid, and the political views of all parties have also become consistent. The people throughout the country have also expressed enthusiastic trust in the measures of the Central Government. This is a symbol of national progress. It is hoped that our patriotic comrades and compatriots throughout the country can all establish the great ambition of saving the country, accept the guidance of the government, and be able to identify and criticize all heresies that endanger the country, in order to achieve the effect of rectifying the source.

The above three points are only a brief overview of my personal feelings for the sake of mutual learning. As for the intention of building the country and saving the country, and the great plan of reviving and defending against foreign aggression, the Central Government already has a definite policy. I hope that our comrades and compatriots will deeply understand and work together. This is what I wish to encourage and strive for with the comrades of our Party and the compatriots throughout the country. (Central News Agency)

### New Year's Holiday for Banks and Money Shops in Beijing

[Nanjing] Banks in Beijing traditionally take a three-day holiday for the New Year. Since the 3rd is Sunday, it was decided to take an additional day off on the 4th, and business will resume as usual on the 5th. The Central Bank has decided to take the same four-day holiday as other banks. According to the Money Shop Association, all money shops will take a three-day holiday from the 1st to the 3rd and will resume business as usual on the 4th. It was also decided that the money market during the holiday period should be the same as the market price on the 31st. The banks' year-end closing accounts and settlements should be completed on the same day. As it is the end of the month and the New Year, the bill exchange house of the banking industry is very crowded with exchanged bills. The exchange time was extended by one hour in the second session. A total of 953 bills were exchanged today, amounting to 5,214,504 yuan and 82 cents, an increase of more than 2 million yuan compared to usual. According to the banking industry, the financial situation this year is similar to that of the previous year. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the financial situation has stabilized, and various speculative businesses have been invisibly curbed. Although the Xi'an Incident suddenly arose recently, the financial situation was not affected. The business nature of banks in Beijing is different from that in Shanghai, so the annual business situation always stands on the horizontal line. (Special dispatch on the 31st)

### New Year's Reflections

— Kong Xiangxi

The year is renewed, and the beginning is auspicious. The New Year's Day of the 26th year is coming again. Looking back to the beginning of the founding of the Republic of China, stubborn ideas and evil forces permeated the whole country and were not easy to eliminate. After more than ten years of turmoil, although countless martyrs sacrificed and fought bravely, the revolutionary doctrine and national strength still failed to be fully demonstrated to the world. Since Chairman Chiang was ordered to launch the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year, and soon after quelled the whole country and established the capital in Nanjing, the National Government was able to be established. This has been more than ten years now. Over the past ten years, externally, there has been strong oppression, seizing our borders, economic aggression, shaking the market; internally, there has been rampant banditry, incessant wars, financial exhaustion, and the collapse of the countryside. Every day has been spent in the midst of stormy seas. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, our compatriots throughout the country have adhered to the established national policy of the Central Government, worked together, struggled arduously, and endured humiliation to strengthen the country. Only then have we achieved today's results. Let's look at the situation in the twenty-fifth year. The central government's decrees are being implemented throughout the country, and the cause of unification is nearing completion. Various constructions are advancing steadily, finance is stable, production is increasing, popular education is gradually becoming widespread, and the spirit of resisting foreign aggression is unanimous throughout the country. The country and the nation have entered the path of rejuvenation. The international community has also changed its old views. We are greatly gratified. Unexpectedly, on December 12th, there was another shocking incident in Xi'an. At that time, China and foreign countries were shocked, as if a great disaster was about to come, and they were uneasy all day long. Fortunately, the perpetrators quickly repented of their mistakes. Chairman Chiang safely returned to Nanjing on the 25th. The dark clouds were swept away. During this short period, we silently observed the various responses from all parties since the incident occurred, as well as the enthusiastic emotions of the people in support. We deeply felt that today's China is no longer the China of the past; and the hope of national rejuvenation will undoubtedly use this incident as a touchstone. When the incident occurred, there were sudden difficulties in politics and military affairs. If the government organization had been slightly unsound, it would have inevitably led to panic and shaken the overall situation. However, the Central Government responded to the Shaanxi Incident, decisively, safeguarding the safety of the leader on the one hand and adhering to the established national policy on the other, calmly and steadily, without surprise. This is sufficient to prove that the organization of the central authorities is solid.

Political changes are most likely to affect finance. Since the reform of the currency system, the reserves have been sufficient, the foreign exchange rate has been stable, and the credit of the legal tender has long been demonstrated at home and abroad. The occurrence of this incident depended on the close cooperation of the financial community at home and abroad with the government, so the market was able to be stable, as usual. This is sufficient to prove that the foundation of finance is stable.

The central and local governments were originally one body. After the Shaanxi Incident, military and civilian officials in various provinces sent messengers one after another, unanimously supporting the central government and rescuing the leader. Regarding various government affairs, they were still able to proceed as usual, maintain law and order, and spare no effort. This is sufficient to prove that the unity between the local and central governments is strong.

Intellectuals are the role models for the people. This time, professors from various universities and academic groups upheld justice and spoke out in righteousness, so that the public opinion of right and wrong was as clear as the sun and moon in the sky. This is sufficient to prove that the direction of political learning is consistent.

Since the occurrence of this incident, from the agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles to the porters, everyone has been running around and calling for the rescue of the leader. On the day Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, cheers resounded throughout the country, and everyone came out of sincerity. The inseparable relationship between the safety of individuals and the country, and the survival of the leader and the nation, has been deeply imprinted in everyone's minds. This is sufficient to prove that the people's knowledge has progressed.

Since the loss of the Northeast, our country's international status has been getting worse and worse. Until last year, when the country was unified, international public opinion gradually changed. After the occurrence of this incident, people from all walks of life in various countries expressed their deep sympathy for Chairman Chiang, and praised the government's calm response. This is sufficient to prove that the international status has increased.

After the Xi'an Incident occurred, all the generals in the country were filled with righteous indignation, and they were eager to volunteer to go to the front. Those who were transferred to the front had an especially intense mood of courageously rushing to the rescue. This is sufficient to prove that the generals and soldiers were eager to serve.

The soldiers guarding the borders were loyal, brave, and patriotic, and repeatedly built miraculous deeds. After this incident occurred, they still maintained their spirit of shared hatred against the enemy and continued to fight bravely. The replenishment of the rear and the consolation of the front lines were not relaxed due to the Shaanxi Incident. This is sufficient to prove that the spirit of resisting foreign aggression has been thoroughly implemented.

A small number of troops in Xi'an were temporarily confused,劫持the commander, and were blamed by the whole country with great righteousness, and moved by the sincerity of Chairman Chiang. They knew that their behavior was wrong, and they were misled by the agitation of the reactionaries. They could not be tolerated by the people, and they soon regretted their mistakes and submitted sincerely, and礼送Chairman Chiang back to Beijing,束身待罪. This is sufficient to prove that the agitation of the reactionaries was ineffective.

Since the incident, the whole country has shown its true sincerity in protecting the national leader, promoting justice, and denouncing criminals. The propaganda of the public opinion circles has been especially diligent. The central government's planes scattered京沪various newspapers in the sky over Xi'an, awakening the misguided dream of the trouble makers, and achieving rapid results. This is sufficient to prove that the power of public opinion is great.

All of the above facts are present. After our pain, we saw these good phenomena and could not help but feel surprised and overjoyed. The strength of our country and nation has gradually been revealed to the world, and Chairman Chiang's ten years of hard work, enduring hardships, and sacrificing himself to save the country and nation has been somewhat gratifying. As the saying goes, worry inspires sages and the crowing of chickens makes a nation prosperous. From now on, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, our entire country should be more diligent and vigilant, continue to work hard, and implement this spirit of loving the country and loving the leader, and complete the great cause of reviving the nation. There are two points that we deeply expect. (1) Struggle for self-reliance. The modern nations that can survive in the world all rely on the brilliance and greatness of their own national strength, so that they can be connected with other nations and jointly maintain world peace. There is no reason to rely on other forces and be able to survive. The Chinese nation has a history of thousands of years. The root cause of the disease is that individual concepts are important and national concepts are light, lacking strict organization and profound training. Therefore, although there are virtues of being able to endure hardship, the power is scattered and cannot be concentrated, and sitting and making mistakes almost led to the disaster of national subjugation. Observing the Sui Bian campaign and the Xi'an Incident, once the national strength is expressed, it can resist foreign aggression and eliminate internal worries. If we add tempering and unite the spirit of progress, so that the national strength will not be dispersed and will be fully expressed on the way to save the country, then the glory of the nation's future can be predicted.

(2) Firm belief in the central doctrine, and support孙总理's三民主主义and the restoration of national morality, as the guide for saving the country. The reason why Chairman Chiang is able to win the support of the people today is that he abides by总理's legacy, puts it into practice, and there is no other way. Therefore, the people who truly support Chairman Chiang do not only support individuals, but also support this central doctrine of saving the country. They do not only complete the matter by supporting it, but everyone must firmly believe in this doctrine and put it into practice. No matter what kind of异说,凡is against the central doctrine, not to be shaken in the slightest, then the hundreds of millions of hearts in the country are united, and no strong force can destroy it. The revival of the country can be achieved through hard work. This is what we have unlimited hope for in addition to欣慰.

When the Xi'an Incident was launched,祥熙was recuperating in Shanghai. Because he was奉中央决议,he temporarily presided over院务during Chairman Chiang's离京period. That night,he 力疾returned to Beijing,任重材轻, and originally did not dare to荷此巨责. Only because he was束发受书, he knew the great meaning of this, and when the党国危亡, he had to勉任其难.以来浹句, all internal and foreign affairs were in accordance with the established national policy, and continued to be carried out, fortunately without贻误. This is all due to the sincere support of my colleagues in the政院and 长官in various places, and the unanimous support of the compatriots throughout the country for the Central Government and the government's trust, which is even more commendable. Now that Chairman Chiang has fortunately returned to Beijing and continues to preside over the great plan,祥熙 can take some responsibility and still follow behind his colleagues and help each other through difficult times under his leadership. Now that it is the beginning of the year, I will briefly offer a year-end speech to show my compatriots in the country, and to express my gratitude to all parties for their support and concern. I hope you will understand.

Tokyo Correspondence

### On the Japanese Coup (Part 2)

— Nan Yun

Due to diplomatic failures and the non-realization of "renewal of all government affairs," although the budget proposal has been passed in the cabinet meeting, it is still subject to review by the parliament. Therefore, Japanese newspapers and magazines have recently been enthusiastically fortune-telling for Hirota.

However, the party cabinet was long ago rejected by the military, and good old men who are unwilling to listen to the military's orders are also unable to form a cabinet. Now is only a quasi-wartime situation; before the outbreak of a major war, who would be suitable to form a cabinet? Most Japanese political commentators guess that the cabinet after Hirota will be the Ugaki cabinet, because Ugaki is from the military and is also a first-rate expert in governing colonies, and there are many supporters of Ugaki in various political parties. However, many young officers in the military are dissatisfied with Ugaki. The "February 26th Incident" was launched by these young officers. If they are not appeased, Ugaki may not dare to "receive the great mandate." Today's Speaker of the House of Peers, Prince Konoe, also dared not accept the recommendation of Elder Saionji because he was not confident in dealing with the military. Otherwise, the first cabinet after the "February 26th Incident" would have been the Konoe cabinet, not the Hirota cabinet.

Today's Hirota cabinet is neither a party cabinet nor a noble cabinet, but a bureaucratic cabinet that obeys the military. The military understands very well that bureaucrats only care about having official positions. Obeying eight parts and resisting two parts is the true nature of bureaucrats. Using their eight parts of obedience to complete wartime preparations, and their two parts of resistance happen to serve as a buffer zone between the military and political parties. An unprecedented budget of more than 3.04 billion yuan was passed in the cabinet meeting in just one and a half hours. This could not have been done without Hirota's bureaucratic cabinet, right?

The military cannot but recognize Japan's constitutional government, so of course, it cannot but recognize legitimate political parties. Today, the military is unwilling to have a party cabinet and only wants to use a bureaucratic cabinet. Tomorrow, if the political party supported by the military grows up, then of course there will be another story. Recently, fascist groups of Japanese nationalism have been carrying out unification work. When the first organizational conference was held on December 15th, in addition to Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu and Lieutenant General Kobayashi Seizaburo, there were also representatives from the "National Polity Protection League," "Greater Japan Youth Party," and "Greater Japan Production Party," etc., various right-wing organizations in attendance to discuss the formation of a "restoration party." This is clearly the military's attempt to use the power of political parties to attack political parties.

Even if the Hirota cabinet ends in the near future, the Hirota-type cabinet will certainly not completely disappear before the outbreak of a major war. However, like the current Minister of Finance Baba, who is essentially a Japanese banker, this major tax increase was implemented single-handedly by him. The successor to the Hirota cabinet may be this type of most active banker. In short, the successor will definitely be a more active Hirota-type cabinet, and this is probably not wrong.

The "Anti-Comintern Pact" and the "North China Issue" between China and Japan are stalled, and the "Fisheries Treaty" between Japan and Russia failed to be signed due to the establishment of the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. This is one of the main targets of recent attacks on the Hirota cabinet. However, according to the evening editions of Tokyo newspapers on December 22nd, although the Soviet Union is unwilling to sign the Fisheries Treaty, it has expressed its willingness to establish a temporary agreement. This news seems to make the archers shooting at Hirota dazzled for a while. What is particularly important is that the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred in China. In this incident, the Hirota cabinet—actually the military—suddenly expressed "wait and see" and extraordinary concern. Under this wait-and-see and concern, Prince De of Inner Mongolia also declared a ceasefire, and the naval landing force that had landed in Qingdao also withdrew. The Hirota cabinet believes that this is a great opportunity for "improvement in Sino-Japanese relations" and is also the main condition for defending the current cabinet from collapsing.

What determines the fate of the Hirota cabinet is, of course, the military. But it might as well be said that it is on the changes in the "neighboring country." (December 22nd)

Current Commentary

### New Year's Sentiments for the Twenty-Sixth Year

— Du

Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. It is also an auspicious time for the beginning of the year. Since ancient times, there have always been wishes at the beginning of the year, hoping for good customs for hundreds of millions of people and celebrating the arrival of good fortune. Getting rid of the old and ushering in the new, carrying on the past and opening up the future, there are meanings to be taken and emotions that cannot be avoided. Since the national crisis, people's hearts have been uneasy. Although they force themselves to be happy, they are mostly discouraged and demoralized. However, there is something I cannot help but say. The meaning of human life activities depends on hope as a link. With hope, there are attempts; with attempts, there is progress. The success of all struggles is driven by hope. Even if the environment is bad, we must strive to improve ourselves. Although the road is full of thorns, we should know to be ambitious and strive to be a hero. Then, at this time of the changing of the year, it is the opportunity for us to sharpen our swords. The praise of pepper flowers can be abandoned, and the evil-warding wine should be poured. Revive our spirit and encourage our enthusiasm, cleanse the past flaws and plan for the future. Auspicious light is abundant, and good fortune is lush. The New Year's Day of the twenty-sixth year is the beginning of the revival of the national fortune and the starting point for the nation to be healthy and strong.

Since the sudden outbreak of the Shaanxi Incident, the highest leader of the national army was actually hijacked, and unable to exercise his authority. At that time, commentators believed that the initiator dared to cause such a shocking change, which could hardly be expected to be quelled overnight. If the war were to continue, foreign aggression would certainly take advantage of it, and the future of the nation would be unbearable. However, the facts showed that the situation took a sharp turn for the better. Not only were all the trapped generals freed, but the person responsible for the incident was also bound to await punishment. And Chiang Kai-shek, who stayed in Xi'an, was able to return to Nanjing five days before the end of the year. The great disaster was fortunately resolved, and the joy of the people was natural. In terms of diplomacy, the Chengdu and Beihai cases, which had been negotiated and delayed for several times, were also resolved through exchange of documents on the day before New Year's Eve. It was intended to end the ominous events of the twenty-fifth year and create new functions for the twenty-sixth year. This is one of the omens of the revival of the national fortune. When the war in Suiyuan broke out, the soldiers at the front line rose up in indignation, regardless of their position. And the enthusiasm of the rear to transport supplies was even more unstoppable. When Chiang Kai-shek was detained in Xi'an, the national leadership lost its center of gravity, and the state of instability was everywhere. If control were lost, the entire situation would immediately collapse. At that time, the government adopted a firm attitude to seek a calm response, and the people took calm steps to wait for the return of the leader. Facing the crisis without confusion, and gathering their will into one, this is the second omen of the national revival.

Based on what has been said above, it is known that the nation has laid the foundation for unity, which cannot be arbitrarily destroyed by external forces. However, we must not think that things have turned around and become complacent. We should seize the opportunity and strive for progress, maintain the situation of unity, and safeguard the overall national policy. Internally, strengthen our own strength, and externally, promote the spirit of the nation. In this way, national sovereignty can be thoroughly implemented, and East Asian peace can be guaranteed. Who does not want to do good? The whole country should work hard, starting from today.

### Poland Refuses to Participate in the German-Japanese Agreement

[London] Germany and Japan previously signed the "Anti-Comintern Pact" in Berlin on November 25th. Article 2 of the pact stipulates, "The signatories shall jointly contact countries that feel threatened by the Comintern to allow those countries to participate in this agreement." People here now believe that Germany and Japan recently jointly contacted the Polish government to ask it to participate in the "Anti-Comintern" agreement, but it has been rejected by the Polish government. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

### Russian Ambassador Tells British People that Soviet Russia is Committed to Peace

Willing to Cooperate with Britain and France Conditionally to Prevent Interference in the Spanish Civil War

[London] Soviet Russian Ambassador Maisky hosted a banquet for guests at the embassy tonight and stood up to give a speech, saying, "I take full responsibility for every word I say today. Today, I announce that the Soviet Russian military is sufficient to defend itself alone and to resist any strong country or any group alone and achieve victory. This is also not revealing state secrets. However, the main purpose of the Soviet Russian Republic is not to win in war, but to eliminate war. This purpose cannot be achieved by Soviet Russia alone. Therefore, Soviet Russia agrees with all plans aimed at promoting goodwill among countries and nations." (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

[Moscow] It was announced here today that the Soviet Russian government is prepared to cooperate with Britain and France to prevent foreigners from participating in the Spanish Civil War, but it has put forward four conditions: (1) All countries that have signed the non-intervention agreement should immediately restrain the influx of foreign volunteers into Spain by effective means. (2) This control method must have nothing to do with the attitude of the Spanish left-wing generals. (3) The signatory countries must organize formal or informal delegations to monitor whether volunteers are flowing into Spain. If there is an influx, it must be announced immediately. (4) The above conditions must take effect immediately in order to prevent the increase of foreign troops. The second condition is quite inconsistent with the policy of the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee, because the committee treats both the left and right sides equally, and the third condition can enable Soviet Russian consuls in Spain to report the arrival of German troops in Spanish territory. (National Telegram on the 30th)

[Moscow] Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov replied to the British and French dispatches today, stating that Soviet Russia is willing to unconditionally agree to prohibit volunteer teams from going to Spain, and said that Soviet Russia has learned that the Spanish Nationalist Army has received assistance from the German and Italian people. These people are traveling to Spain in teams on specially prepared ships. Judging from their condition, military equipment, and specially transferred ships, it cannot be regarded as a voluntary movement. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

### Germany Plans to Stop Sending Volunteers to Aid Spanish Rebels

Italy Will Submit a Reply to Britain and France Immediately, Expressing Agreement in Principle

[Berlin] According to foreign sources today, the departure of volunteers from various parts of Germany to Spain has now been postponed, pending the decision of Führer Hitler on the future policy towards the Spanish Civil War. Reliable sources revealed that there are currently 10,000 German volunteers in Spain. There are fewer Italians and between 40,000 and 50,000 French. Spokespersons for the Propaganda Department and the Foreign Ministry today dismissed Mussolini's request for Hitler to withdraw from Spain as ridiculous, saying that Germany does not need foreign advice. German army officers are greatly surprised by the effectiveness of Russian pilots and tanks in the Spanish government army. These officers have never believed in the power of Soviet Russian military equipment. Now they are gradually believing that Soviet Russia not only has the largest air force in Europe, but also the most elite air force in Europe. (National Telegram on the 30th)

[Rome] It is heard that Italy's reply to the British and French proposal on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War will express agreement in principle, but will require a firm guarantee that countries that sympathize with the Madrid government, especially France and Russia, must maintain the non-intervention agreement. The reply will be sent out in a day or two. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th).

[Rome] The governments of Britain and France recently sent notes to the governments of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia, advising them not to send any more volunteers to Spain to join the war. It is now learned that the Italian government's reply to the note will be sent out in a day or two. Political figures are convinced that, even if the wording of Italy's reply is not exactly the same as the reply that Germany should submit, its general meaning is consistent. In other words, the replies from Italy and Germany should accept in principle the expansion of the non-intervention measures in the Spanish Civil War to include the ban on volunteers joining the war. However, when this measure is implemented, actual facts should be taken into account. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

[London] Regarding the strict supervision when implementing non-intervention measures in the Spanish Civil War, the Coordination Committee sent a note to the governments of the countries concerned last week, asking them to express their opinions. It is now learned that the Italian government has submitted a reply expressing its support for the strict supervision proposal. Italy is now continuing to argue that all issues of indirect interference in the Spanish Civil War should be discussed as a whole. However, indirect interference takes many different forms and should be studied item by item. For practical convenience, the issue of banning volunteers from joining the war may be discussed first. In this regard, Italy has accepted in principle the ban on volunteers joining the war, but on the condition that all countries accept this proposal and strictly abide by it, that is, any private individuals going to Spain should also be banned. The Italian government has also requested that all cash stored abroad by both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War be "neutralized" and that public fundraising be prohibited for use by either party in the civil war. The two sub-committees of the Coordination Committee, which are responsible for handling the issues of "Volunteers Joining the War" and "Financial Assistance," are now scheduled to meet at the Foreign Ministry tomorrow to review the Italian government's reply. It is heard that the British and French governments believe that the prohibition of any private individuals from going to Spain is contrary to the current laws of their respective countries and is difficult to implement. As for the "neutralization" of stored gold, it is also difficult to implement, because the cash stored in London and Paris by both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War is not in the name of the government, but only in the name of private individuals. In London, it is entrusted to banks for safekeeping in the name of private individuals, and the banks have a professional obligation to keep the names of the trustees confidential. In Paris, the two parties in Spain often rent safe deposit boxes from banks under assumed names to store cash. These safe deposit boxes can only be opened by order of the judicial authorities after a lawsuit is filed. Therefore, it is actually difficult to prohibit the withdrawal of this type of stored gold, and there are many complications. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

### German Ship Released, German Government Satisfied

Spanish Rebels Send Representatives to Germany and Italy

[Berlin] The German government seems quite satisfied with the Spanish government's prompt release of the German ship Palos. Today, the official news agency issued a communiqué praising the captain of the German cruiser Königsberg for handling the case seriously and cautiously. However, it expressed regret that one of the Spanish passengers on the ship was arrested by the Spanish authorities and that part of the cargo on the ship was also confiscated by the Spanish authorities, because the cargo carried by the ship did not contain war materials. The communiqué demanded a complete clarification of these two matters. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

[Paris] The Spanish Embassy in France has issued a statement saying that after the German merchant ship "Palos" was released by the authorities of the Basque Autonomous Region, the captain of the German cruiser "Königsberg" immediately sent a radio message to Aguirre, the head of the autonomous region, in the name of the German government, which was somewhat like a formal complaint, stating, "The 'Palos' was detained by warships of the Spanish government army 23 miles off the coast of Spain, that is, on the high seas, which is a violation of international law. The authorities of the Basque Autonomous Region must immediately return the seized goods and release the Spanish person on board, otherwise the autonomous region government will be responsible for all the consequences." Aguirre immediately replied, "The 'Palos' was detained within Spanish territorial waters, and its cargo contained raw materials for the manufacture of bombs and gunpowder, as well as military radio transceivers, which are contraband military supplies and can be confiscated according to international law." The captain of the "Königsberg" replied that he had received the reply, and nothing else. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)

Avila: After Germany and Italy recognized the Spanish Nationalist Army government, they respectively appointed representatives to the Spanish Nationalist Army government in Burgos. They have also recently appointed Garcia as the representative to Italy and Terstrada as the representative to Germany, and sent consuls to Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Munich in Germany, and Trieste and Genoa in Italy. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)

### British Embassy in Madrid Relocates

Consulate Remains

Madrid: Although the British Embassy in Madrid will move to Valencia with the Spanish government, it has now been decided that the British Consulate in Madrid will remain. The British expatriates who do not advocate leaving the area feel somewhat relieved after hearing this. The British expatriates were disappointed yesterday after receiving the news that the British government had decided to move the embassy to Valencia. The British Chamber of Commerce in Madrid has telegraphed British Foreign Secretary Eden, stating the reasons against the relocation of the British Embassy. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

Madrid: British Chargé d'Affaires Forbes has been ordered to move to Valencia. The last group of British expatriates here is also scheduled to go to Alicante on Friday, and then go to Marseille, France, and Gibraltar. The personnel of the British Embassy will also move to Valencia later. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)

[London] The Foreign Office yesterday ordered the Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Forbes, to move from Madrid to Valencia in order to maintain direct contact with the Spanish Republican government. It is generally interpreted that this move is intended to allow the last group of British expatriates in Madrid to withdraw completely, so Forbes was first ordered to leave the capital. As for whether a British Vice Consul will be stationed in Madrid, it is a temporary measure to protect British commercial interests and, if necessary, assist in the withdrawal of expatriates.

### 1936 Retrospective on Japanese Politics and Economics

[Tokyo] It is fortunate that the eventful year of 1936 was able to pass without the expected great disaster. Although Japan encountered many unprecedented and serious incidents in various aspects of both domestic and foreign affairs during this year, it entered 1937 peacefully, similar to other countries in the world. This fact can be considered a piece of good fortune for the Far East. The February 26th Incident was Japan's most serious event this year, which is widely known. The Hirota Cabinet was formed in the broad and profound aftermath of the incident, with "military purification" and "renewal of general administration" as its greatest tasks. Thanks to the efforts of Army Minister Terauchi over the past ten months, "military purification" has achieved considerable success, but the price for this has been an unprecedented military expansion plan, which has been passed by the Cabinet and submitted to the parliament. The discussion on "renewal of general administration" is still ongoing and has not yet yielded results. Although half of the seven political plans announced by the Cabinet in August of this year have been incorporated into the next fiscal year's budget draft, the other half is still under detailed review, which has caused various criticisms. The most serious and complex task of "renewal of general administration" is the reform of the administrative structure, for which Hirota is currently hesitating, as it involves the basic organization of Japanese politics. Japan's decision to increase military preparations, adopt the so-called "quasi-wartime system", implement large-scale tax increase plans, and the Japan-Germany Agreement are sufficient to show Japan's "quasi-wartime system" in economic and diplomatic terms. If the administrative structure reform is realized, the political aspect will also become a "quasi-wartime system." Therefore, this point is important. Although the administrative structure will inevitably undergo some reforms in the future, whether the degree of reform can satisfy those who advocate reform is still a question. This is one of the factors determining the fate of the Hirota Cabinet.

Another thorny issue in Japanese domestic affairs is the reform of the parliamentary system. Some parties want to weaken parliamentary power, strengthen and concentrate the power of the cabinet, and make the administrative structure a prerequisite for the "quasi-wartime system." Because parliamentary power is granted by the constitution, any restrictions will inevitably involve constitutional issues. Political parties regard the parliament as their last lifeline, so if parliamentary power is restricted, political parties will collapse. Therefore, the current parliament will raise severe questions about the government's belief in parliament. Whether the Hirota Cabinet can clearly and affirmatively express its belief will be another factor determining the fate of the Cabinet.

The most important issue in the current parliament is the tax increase plan. The impact of this plan on people's lives is unprecedented. Therefore, the people hope that the parliament will abolish it. However, the parliament is in a dilemma between the government and the people. If it passes the plan, it will violate the people's protests and further damage the authority of political parties. If it opposes the plan, there is a risk of promoting its own dissolution. Even if the government has no intention of dissolving the parliament, it will at least increase the friction between political parties and certain parties, which is a serious crisis for party politics. This is another factor determining the fate of the Hirota Cabinet.

Diplomatic failures, although still the target of strong attacks, have shown signs of easing due to the conclusion of the Japan-Australia trade agreement and the extension of the Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty. On the first day of the current parliament, far-right political parties such as the National Alliance urgently proposed questioning the government's diplomacy. Although the Seiyukai and Minseito parties dissuaded them, the tension in the parliamentary atmosphere has been fully revealed. The Japan-Germany Agreement will undoubtedly be one of the focal points of parliamentary questioning. The failure of the new Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty to obtain the signature of the Soviet Union will also become an unavoidable serious diplomatic responsibility. The failure of the Sino-Japanese negotiations has further strengthened the opinions of various parties opposing the government's diplomatic policy. In recent days, the general view has been that political parties should be cautious about diplomatic issues, but the parliament clearly does not want to let it pass easily. If the current cabinet makes a wrong step in dealing with the parliament, there will be serious developments. This is another deciding point for the fate of the Hirota Cabinet.

The above four points not only sufficiently represent the characteristics of Japan's domestic and foreign affairs this year, but also serve as a prospect for future trends. Whether the Hirota Cabinet continues to exist is far less important than future trends. Finally, we should pay attention to Japan's policy toward China. After the Xi'an Incident, the Japanese people's perception of China has undergone a new change. At the beginning of the incident, a few Japanese people who were unaware of China's recent situation had incorrect observations. However, the intellectual class generally believed that China would not fall back into chaos simply because of the Xi'an Incident. When the incident was resolved, all parties in Japan were startled to realize that China's political, financial, monetary, and organizational structures were more stable than expected. Chiang Kai-shek's passing through a vote of confidence from the Chinese people in the incident was even more surprising to the Japanese. Therefore, the idea of "not dealing with China with preconceptions" has become more and more powerful. Due to the strengthening of China's unified forces, Japan's policy toward China next year may have to focus on economic cooperation. The reporter firmly believes that due to China's increasingly solid unity and unyielding diplomatic responses, Sino-Japanese relations will gradually improve next year.

The important developments in Japan's economy over the past year can be described as follows: (1) the quasi-wartime nature has become more active; (2) the contradictions in various production sectors have become increasingly acute; (3) massive excess of imports; (4) the determination of huge budgets and tax increase plans; (5) the people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. Since Army Minister Terauchi took office and advocated a widespread awareness of national defense and increased military preparations in Manchuria, the quasi-wartime nature of the Japanese economy has advanced further this year. In addition to the astonishing expansion of state-owned heavy industries this year, private military industries subsidized by the government have also made considerable progress. Steel production this year has increased threefold compared to 1932. The electricity industry, one of the centers of Japanese military production, has seen its capital increase a hundredfold compared to 1932. This point is particularly noteworthy. The government has almost controlled all aspects of Japanese economic life based on mobilization, and it is becoming increasingly severe. First, it promulgated laws to control various important industries and the automobile industry, and then promulgated the Fertilizer Control Law, revised the Exchange Control Law, established the Currency Control Law, strengthened import and export controls, placed various insurance companies under government management, merged local banks, etc. The centralization of tax revenue, the nationalization of the electricity industry, the standardization of industrial production that can be used for military preparations, and the connection between local industries and military industries are all important steps toward a wartime economy. However, due to the abnormal development of military industries, the ordinary economy has been greatly unbalanced. For example, the average index of metallurgical production this year is as high as 266 (1928 is 100), while silk fabrics are only 122, and food and beverages are even lower at 99. Furthermore, the severe shortage of raw materials in Japan has been fully exposed due to the insane development of military industries. Hundreds of small and medium-sized metallurgical factories in Kawaguchi and Kobe have recently been closed due to the lack of pig iron, and countless workers have lost their jobs. It is beyond doubt that the exhaustion of domestic production capacity under the needs of military preparations this year will be exacerbated by the huge military budget next year. Japan's international trade in 1936 showed a decline in both quantity and quality. There was an excess of imports of 133 million yen, an increase of 85% compared to 1935. One-fourth of the imported goods were military materials, while the main export goods, cotton cloth and wheat flour, decreased by 3.3% and 48%, respectively. Among the 127 countries that have trade relations with Japan, the number of countries boycotting Japanese goods has increased to 76. Trade talks between Japan and the United Kingdom, Japan and India, Japan and the Netherlands, Japan and Egypt, and Japan and Canada have either failed to continue or have yielded no results. The factors controlling Japanese trade this year will only intensify next year. Japan paid out 250 million yen in gold this year, breaking the record of 1931. What is even more surprising is that the new budget reaches 3.04 billion yen, exceeding this year's by more than a quarter and more than double that of 1931. Excluding special funds given to local governments, the army alone accounts for 4.99%. If subsidies for aircraft and chemical industries are included, Japan's national defense budget for 1937 totals 178 million yen, which is larger than any non-wartime country and comparable only to Germany before the Great War. At the same time, the funds for relieving rural small and medium-sized industries are only 24 million yen, less than 1% of the total expenditure. The Hirota Cabinet, which claims to stabilize people's lives, is contradicting its previous statements. Minister of Finance Baba has promised a budget of 3.04 billion yen, and he has to resort to increasing taxes to a huge 1.424 billion yen, which is 500 million yen or 55% more than this year. On the one hand, 961 million yen of deficit bonds will be issued. Most of the tax increase plan items and several new taxes will greatly increase the burden on the people. The result will reduce the elasticity of tax revenue. At the same time, Japan's loss-making power will be reduced to 700 million yen (1.91 billion yen in 1910 and 800 million yen in 1935). Whether the bond issuance plan can be successful is a big question. Japan's public debt has exceeded 10 billion yen this year. In the next six years, it will increase by 1 billion yen each year, reaching 16 billion yen by 1941. Although it is according to the plan of Finance Minister Baba, the issuance of public bonds will be reduced by 100 million yen each year after 1941 until 1949, when no more debts can be borrowed. At that time, the Japanese government's debt will reach 20 billion yen, which makes the Japanese people very anxious. Although the government authorities refuse to admit that Japan has fallen into vicious inflation, this has become obvious this year. A look at the amount of banknotes issued reveals that it has increased sharply from 1.2 billion yen at the beginning of this year to a huge 2 billion yen on December 29. If we consider the construction of military preparations and rising prices, vicious inflation will inevitably be more severe next year. Under this situation, those who feel seriously threatened are undoubtedly millions of Japanese laborers. The increase in the cost of living is one of the direct threats to them. According to official statistics, it has reached 203.5 at the end of this year. The cost of living in 1900 was 100. On the other hand, currency wages have depreciated to 81 (non-real wages). According to official statistics, there were 1,457 labor disputes in the first nine months of this year, 237 more than in the same period last year. This is not accidental. It is also impossible to ignore the increased unrest in rural areas. According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there were a total of 6,824 tenant disputes in the one year ending at the end of July 1936, an increase of about 1,000 cases compared to the same period last year. In short, Japan has entered 1937 with a very highly developed "quasi-wartime system." Because there are opposition and unease, how long this system can be allowed to continue is a question that needs to be carefully explored. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 31st)

### Baldwin's New Year's Oration

Wishing this year to be a year of peace

[London] Prime Minister Baldwin is scheduled to deliver an oration at the Conservative Party's "Sunflower Union" on New Year's Day, in order to review the government's administration over the past year. The contents are roughly as follows: "The government has been very concerned about various diplomatic issues in the past year. The European situation is precarious. As a result, most people are deeply convinced that if Britain wants to avoid attacks from other countries and be a pillar of peace, the government's current foreign policy is the only possible policy. I am deeply convinced of this. As for the process of expanding military preparations, this is to deal with the world situation. European countries are now expanding their military preparations, so in Britain, no matter who is in power, military preparations cannot be ignored. However, for various military actions, Britain will not participate in any military actions that are inconsistent with the League of Nations Covenant. All countries do not need to worry that Britain has aggressive intentions. The British government has done its best to promote the reduction of military preparations in various countries through the conclusion of international agreements. Only after our efforts have clearly failed did the government decide to strengthen the defensive national defense equipment." Although there are many issues that can disrupt and threaten world peace at this time, I firmly believe that 1937 will be a "year of peace," and Britain's national power will become more prosperous.

### The US economy is thriving

Trade development reduces unemployment

[Washington] Secretary of Commerce Roper issued a year-end message, celebrating the gradual recovery of various businesses in 1936, but warned the public not to underestimate the lingering depression. Roper said that the number of unemployed people in 1936 has decreased significantly, but the unemployment problem is still important today. He hopes that the joint efforts of the business community and the government, aided by the expansion of business, can continue to make significant progress in solving the unemployment problem in 1937. Roper also mentioned the increase in industrial production, farm income, commerce, and foreign trade, saying that today's activities are the most prosperous since 1930 and still show a thriving trend.

### The Pope of Rome is not out of danger

Attended Mass last night at midnight

Vatican City Today, the blood clots in the Pope's left leg have gradually disappeared tonight, so his condition has improved significantly. He took a short nap this afternoon, but there is still a possibility of blood clots and a recurrence of the risk of detachment, so it cannot be said that he is out of danger. In addition, the Pope's heart is quite weak, which is also a dangerous point. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

Vatican City This afternoon, the Pope's condition has improved slightly, and the pain is also slightly relieved. The Pope has decided to personally welcome the New Year. He will be awakened before midnight and go to the temporary chapel next to his bedroom to attend midnight Mass. At that time, the Pope will lie in a comfortable easy chair to avoid fatigue. The Pope's physician has allowed him to participate in this ceremony, which shows that his condition has indeed improved. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)

Vatican City There are many people in Rome suffering from influenza, which makes the Pope's physicians very worried. Because the Pope's condition is critical, it is difficult to resist even a slight cold. Therefore, the Vatican authorities only allowed a few visitors to enter today to prevent the Pope from catching a cold. (National Electricity dispatch on the 30th)

### US fresh fruit exports to France decrease

There are two reasons for this

[Washington] The current trade agreement between France and the United States has mutually stipulated import quotas for goods between the two countries. US fresh fruit exporters have protested to the State Department because the amount of fresh fruit sold to France recently has not reached the quota stipulated in the trade agreement. The State Department has recently sent someone to investigate whether the decrease in fresh fruit exports to France is only due to the devaluation of the franc. American business people believe that there are two reasons for this: one is due to the devaluation of the franc, and the other is due to the poor harvest of fresh fruit in the United States this year, which has led to higher prices and a decrease in exports to France.

### US auto industry suffers from overproduction

Factory shutdowns increase unemployment

Detroit Today, General Motors issued a temporary announcement, ordering its subsidiaries to stop supplying parts to various manufacturing departments to avoid exceeding the amount needed for production. From this, we can understand a glimpse of the labor unrest in the US auto industry. The second factory of Fisher Body Company started a strike yesterday, causing 1,200 workers to lose their jobs. The shutdown of the assembly and delivery departments of Chevrolet Company has also caused more than a thousand workers to lose their jobs. According to the above two companies, both are subsidiaries of General Motors. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

### Naval Treaty Expires

Britain, the United States, and Japan prepare to compete, with the United States currently dominating

[New York] The Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty will both expire at midnight today. The New York Min Sheng Pao recently commented on this, stating that Britain, the United States, and Japan will definitely re-engage in an arms race in the future. As for the total tonnage of the existing navies of each country, the United States ranks first, with a total of 1,700,000 tons. Britain ranks second, with a total of 1,200,000 tons. Japan ranks third, with a total of 750,000 tons. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)

[London] Britain's armament plan will be stepped up at the beginning of next year. The naval aspect is scheduled to build two battleships, five cruisers, one aircraft carrier, eighteen destroyers, and six submarines. Among them, two battleships will start construction on New Year's Day. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

### Roosevelt convenes a meeting to discuss strengthening the Neutrality Act

New Congress opens at the beginning of this month to discuss many important bills

[Washington] President Roosevelt convened Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Representative MacReynolds, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and Acting Secretary of State Moore today to discuss strengthening the current Neutrality Act as soon as possible. The State Department's recent permission for Wheeler Company to transport aircraft and aircraft engines to Spain was the motivation for convening this meeting. (National Electricity dispatch on the 30th)

[New York] The important events to be discussed by the current Congress have all been included in the agenda. Among them, the following items will be discussed in advance:

[1) Expansion and strengthening of the Neutrality Act. Because of the looming war clouds in Europe and the moral ban on transporting weapons to Spain, there is a risk of collapse, so the general public is paying close attention to this.

[2) Saving expenses, especially focusing on balancing the budget.

[3) The agency that replaces the National Recovery Administration. President Roosevelt is likely to pressure Congress to pass laws stipulating minimum wages, maximum working hours, and the abolition of child labor.

[4) Revising the monetary powers granted to the President, especially paying attention to the fund for stabilizing exchange rates.

[5) Expansion of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.

[6) Farm rent and grain insurance.

[7) Minimum cost of housing.

[8) Re-submitting the St. Lawrence River Treaty to the Senate for approval.

[9) Revising the social security system and reforming the tax system. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

[Washington] Congress is about to open, and there are many domestic issues to be resolved. However, President Roosevelt still took the time today to discuss neutrality issues with Acting Secretary of State Moore, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative McReynold, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, to avoid the sparks from spreading and causing the European situation to become a prairie fire. The State Department sent a telegram to the US Embassy in Paris today, explaining the government's actions, saying that the government cannot prohibit the transportation of aircraft to Spain according to law. It is a pity that US businessmen are unwilling to comply with the government's strict neutrality policy. Secretary of the Army Woodring claimed today that at the beginning of January this year, the Department of the Army sold 300 outdated aircraft engines to Vimala Company. It is not known whether the engines that the company intends to transport to Spain are those engines. At the same time, the Washington Post believes that Vimala Company may have a connection with Antog, the Soviet Russian commercial agency in the United States. Therefore, officials immediately reviewed the files of the House of Representatives' investigation of the Communist Party and found that Gas, the former deputy director of Antog, testified in court that Vimala Company purchased 400 aircraft engines from Antog in 1927 and transported them to Soviet Russia. This situation is a shortcoming of the Neutrality Act. However, Congress can pass any remedial measures as soon as possible, and the State Department can revoke the issued license. (National Electricity dispatch on the 30th)

[Washington] The US Congress is scheduled to reconvene on January 5. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will submit a draft law on the following day, requesting that a clause be added to the current Neutrality Act so that the ban on weapons can also be applied to other countries' civil wars. (The intention of this clause is to prevent 18 aircraft and 411 engines from being transported to Spain. (People in the know recently announced that when the Chaco War broke out in 1934, Congress passed a bill on May 28 of that year and delegated the power of expediency to President Roosevelt to implement a ban on weapons to Bolivia and Paraguay, the two parties involved. The content of the draft law to be submitted this time will be similar to the previous case. President Roosevelt has decided to request Congress to take emergency procedures, so this new bill must be quickly submitted for discussion, and most members of Congress will support it. Even the opposition Republican leader Vandenberg also supports the prohibition of transporting aircraft to Spain, but opposes the delegation of the power of expediency to the President. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

[Washington] The US State Department issued an export permit yesterday, approving the transportation of 18 aircraft and 411 engines to Spain, to be delivered to the Spanish Republican government. The State Department recently instructed the ambassadors to France, Britain, Germany, Russia, and Italy to explain to the governments of their respective countries that the US current Neutrality Act only applies the clause on banning weapons to other countries' external wars and does not apply to other countries' civil wars. Therefore, there is no way to prohibit the export of the above aircraft. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

Mexico City The US government approved the export of 18 aircraft to Spain yesterday. Nine of them have flown from the United States to this city and are parked in the hangar of the central airport. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

### Yugoslavia and Bulgaria make progress in treaty negotiations

Political and economic cooperation is intended to increase influence in the Balkans

Belgrade Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have made progress in negotiating a friendship treaty to protect the current borders of the two countries and guarantee their political and economic cooperation. It is widely believed that the purpose of these negotiations is to make Bulgaria join the Balkan Pact. It is said that Bulgaria has clearly abandoned its revisionist demands, which may be due to the pressure of Italy. Italy's influence in the Balkans will therefore increase.

He would provide assistance to farmers, relief to the unemployed, and safeguard industry, commerce, and handicrafts. He also commended the current government's restoration of compulsory military service and establishment of a new army. In essence, his policy is to follow the traditional policies of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and continue to advance, as only this can prevent foreign powers from conquering Austria.

### Guangdong Business Community Requests Loans for Lunar New Year

Provincial Bank Plans to Issue Acceptance Bills; Merchants Request Cash Loans as Before

Guangzhou Correspondence: With the Lunar New Year approaching, the Guangdong business community, adhering to tradition, settles accounts at the end of the year, mostly in the last month of the lunar year. In the past year, due to the impact of social and economic decline, there has been no large-scale trade in the market. Although the number of bankruptcy cases at the end of the year has slightly decreased, the financial market has experienced significant fluctuations due to several political upheavals. The most affected are silver firms because the value of currencies and bonds fluctuates constantly, and silver firms with hundreds of thousands of capital can go bankrupt in an instant. Recently, due to the Xi'an Incident, more than a dozen silver firms have gone bankrupt due to losses in currency trading. The bankruptcy of these silver firms has affected the financial turnover of various shops and stores. Therefore, at the end of this lunar year, the market is showing a sudden shortage of funds. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has petitioned the Finance Department, requesting the Provincial Bank to follow the old practice of previous years and provide loans for the New Year to provide relief. The Provincial Bank has prepared five million yuan for New Year loans, but the loan method is not to release cash directly but to use acceptance bills. Merchants who need funds to get through the New Year can pledge their stored goods to the Provincial Bank as collateral and receive a bill of exchange, stating the amount of the loan they wish to borrow. After receiving the application, the bank will send staff to the store requesting the loan to verify the situation. If it is confirmed, they will sign the original bill of exchange, acknowledging the responsibility to repay the loan when it is due. This bill of exchange will have the same effect as currency and can circulate in the market. If necessary, it can also be discounted at the bank to request immediate payment of cash to facilitate capital turnover. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened discussions with various merchants regarding this acceptance bill method. It was decided to appoint executive committee members of the chamber, together with representatives from the cotton yarn industry, sugar and flour industry, peanut industry, sesame industry, grain industry, coal industry, bean industry, export trading houses, silk industry, raw medicinal materials industry, prepared medicinal materials industry, rice and sugar industry, Chinese and foreign general merchandise industry, and local and foreign head offices, to negotiate everything with the Provincial Bank. As a result, the cotton yarn industry, native cloth industry, sugar and flour industry, and leather industry, etc., due to excessive inventory, urgently need cash turnover, so they all agreed to the acceptance bills. However, some merchants who need cash but do not have goods to pledge, such as silver firms and gold businesses, etc., inevitably feel left out. Therefore, they plan to request the Provincial Bank to organize commercial credit acceptance bills to universally benefit merchants. There are also those who believe that the procedures for acceptance bills are too cumbersome, and merchants do not fully benefit from them, requesting that the Provincial Bank still follow the old practice of previous years, designating loan amounts so that merchants can borrow money by mortgaging real estate. Therefore, New Year loans have not yet been implemented. (29th)

### Shanxi Provincial Government Orders County Magistrates to Seriously Handle the Improvement of the Village System (Continued)

Promulgating Important Notes on the Procedures for Implementing Village Improvement Expenses; Selecting and Sending Village Chiefs for Training Starting March 1st Next Year

D. When provisionally organizing villages, special attention should be paid to the distance and whether they are united. If the old village organization was formed due to the customs of the same covenant or the same Li-Jia, etc., resulting in a long or intermingled village organization, it must be thoroughly re-divided during this reorganization, and the intermingled villages or villages that are far from the main village should be combined with neighboring villages. If the number of households in the originally organized village is insufficient, it should also be jointly combined with nearby villages to facilitate handling matters. E. When provisionally organizing villages, if there are intermingled villages crossing the boundaries of two districts, for the convenience of organization and jurisdiction, they may be re-divided and transferred to another jurisdiction as appropriate, without being restricted by the old boundaries of each district, so as not to hinder factual convenience. (4) The county magistrate and the district chiefs should jointly hire impartial local gentry, five from each district. After consultation, the county magistrate will send appointment letters and immediately notify the gentry to arrive at the county on January 6th to review whether the provisional village organization planned by the county district conforms to local conditions, provide as much advice as possible, and make a careful decision. (5) The outline of the village improvement system and the rules for the selection, appointment, and treatment of village chiefs and deputies should be distributed to each village, and the village chiefs or primary school teachers should explain them to the villagers so that everyone is aware. (January 4th) (1) Continue discussing the organization and division of villages and drawing preliminary village organization sketches. (2) Predict the difficulties that may arise when reorganizing each village, and each department chief and district chief should propose several issues and properly discuss solutions. (January 5th) (1) Continue discussing the organization and division of villages and draw preliminary village organization sketches and descriptions, and provisional organization tables for each village (table format omitted). Plan the procedures and preparations for the meeting of the gentry of each district tomorrow to review the plans. (2) Order each district to notify the village chiefs and deputy chiefs of each village and each joint village to arrive at the county or district office on January 9th for a meeting. Counties with small villages should hold meetings in the county; counties with large villages should hold meetings in the district.

Caught Using Counterfeit Money

Fengjing Peak Grand Ceremony: At around 8 a.m. on the 28th, Shen Boying's wife from Fangjia Xia Township went to redeem clothes, presenting a counterfeit 10-yuan Central Bank note to be changed. The pawnshop clerk recognized the counterfeit money and asked her to exchange it. Unexpectedly, the five notes she carried were all the same, indicating that she was using counterfeit money. The woman was immediately taken to the Public Security Bureau. According to her confession, the rice money was given to her by Fang Xiuyun from the same village. Director Xia immediately sent detectives to arrest Fang in a teahouse, where they found thirteen 1-yuan Central Bank counterfeit notes. At the same time, villager Fang Yuyun also handed over four yuan worth of banknotes given to him by Fang Xiuyun for rice money, which were also the same counterfeit notes. Fang Xiuyun was taken back together with the counterfeit money and a document was submitted to the County Public Security Bureau for verification.

Qingtian Reef Channel Changes

The Qingtian Reef channel on the Tongzhou River used to be extremely dangerous, making navigation difficult for river vessels. It has now been surveyed by the Customs and a new navigation route has been discovered. The original channel has been closed due to siltation, and the river's lightships have also been moved.

### One Year of Scientific Progress

— Translated by Eric N. Davis

In news magazines, one often sees vivid articles describing important public events. If someone were to similarly narrate the scientific achievements of any given year, he would find many difficulties.

Today’s record will be buried by another miracle tomorrow, and forgotten by almost everyone in a week. Several weeks ago, an aviator achieved an unprecedented feat: he flew to nearly ten miles above the ground; but who could have predicted that, before this event was even announced, another, more fortunate Icarus would fly even closer to the sun and return safely?

In any case, the astronomical realm, now beyond the reach of the naked eye, will soon be captured by camera lenses, because the two-hundred-inch telescope on Mount Palomar has been successfully cast, and after a complex and time-consuming polishing process, it can be used. This giant lens is roughly "sawed" instead of silver-coated ("Auminized") because someone discovered that aluminum has many, many advantages over silver! In the near future, "silver-coated mirrors" will probably disappear from major observatories around the world.

New Discoveries in the Milky Way

Nineteen thirty-six was a year worth remembering for astronomers, because in that year, Dr. Shapley, director of the Harvard Observatory, announced the discovery of the Milky Way’s "window," through which humans for the first time were able to peer into the depths of the universe from amidst the chaotic mists, and, according to reports, as a result of this invention, as many as one hundred and forty-seven different novae have been discovered.

As for the observation of nearby objects, science has invented the "electron image tube"—which uses a fluorescent screen as an artificial retina—giving mankind "eyes" that see almost four times as far as normal. On this retina, the "electron image tube" receives and transmits clear images, which are transmitted by infrared rays (also known as "black light")—invisible to the human eye. In addition to astronomy, medicine, biology, and military affairs are all looking forward to gaining great benefits from this newly invented device.

In the military field, the latest naval shells can penetrate twelve-inch armor plating and be fired without being damaged. The aircraft cannon invented by the Swiss (which normally can only fire machine gun bullets) can fire eight hundred bombs per minute.

Glass Houses

Besides those destructive things, there are other questions about the sky. Although the man who broke the record for the highest stratosphere in a balloon has not yet been found, small balloons carrying automatic recorders are often launched into the high sky above the clouds to study the mysterious problem of cosmic rays that are constantly bombarding the earth.

Although the question of the origin of cosmic rays is still under debate, it is unanimously acknowledged that cosmic rays can pass through any obstacle. Therefore, there is no reason to worry that glass bricks used for construction will crack due to cosmic rays. Glass bricks are translucent, not opaque; they can let almost eighty percent of all light into the interior of houses built with this kind of brick.

However, sunlight alone cannot completely guarantee health, at least not for individuals subject to heredity and environment. Human beings are still bound to suffer from many diseases. However, thanks to the cooperation of chemists and surgeons, research on the sources and effective treatments of diseases has been progressing daily.

Five New Elements

Several diseases, considered incurable a few years ago, can now be treated or cured. Generally speaking, the methods are obtained through systematic long-term research, but sometimes they are also due to unexpected accidental discoveries.

For example, the use of insulin to treat diabetes is, of course, a recent invention, but according to recent findings, if zinc is added to the injection, the life of insulin's effect can be extended considerably. Also, after two years of experimentation, patients with arthritis can be cured by a newly discovered chemical compound, and the popular belief that arthritis is caused by infection has also been overturned.

For many years, the scientific community has unanimously assumed that there are at most ninety-two truly existing elements—gold, nitrogen, lead, oxygen, and others. However, according to a report from the famous Hugh Keforham Institute, the bombardment of atoms of uranium—the heaviest and most complex element—has resulted in the production of at least five new, heavier, and more complex elements.

Man-Made Materials

Like radium and uranium, these new elements are all radioactive, so they cannot exist stably, which is probably the reason why these new elements cannot be found in the universe. Because the amount produced is so small, some people may doubt whether the discovery of these new elements is a mistake, but careful and accurate chemical tests have fully proven their existence.

However, in addition to pursuing knowledge for the sake of knowledge, chemists have other motivations.

The current world economic situation is enough to entice chemists to compete with nature. Artificial rubber, although different in form from natural products, is a valuable raw material. In the Soviet Union, the production of artificial rubber made from alcohol reached 25,000 tons last year and is expected to increase to 40,000 tons in one or two years. Germany is another country known for its technological progress in this area; a factory in the United States can manufacture as much as one million pounds of rubber substitutes per year.

These artificial materials are not all made to replace natural products. For example, a railway company makes a steel plate with a pattern and form similar to wood. Also, a certain metal alloy, which looks like gold and is stronger than steel, is actually composed mostly of copper and a small amount of beryllium: if the cost could be reduced, the use of this alloy could be greatly expanded.

What is the Most Outstanding?

The use of artificial resins is becoming increasingly widespread, and the recently discovered use related to aircraft construction will obviously have a profound impact on aircraft design. In fact, some people have made predictions that the light and bright low-wing monoplanes that are currently considered very fashionable will become as old-fashioned in ten years as the biplanes and triplanes of 1918 are today.

So, among the various scientific achievements of 1936, which can be called the most outstanding?

Answering this question is not an easy task, because when this question is asked to anyone, each person will have their own biases. However, the progress of television, which is known to the public, although not yet completely successful and the equipment used is expensive, is probably an important achievement.

Radio communication has created a miracle, turning different ethnic groups separated by high mountains and vast seas into neighbors! Even if not into friends. — We can hope that practical vision is the last link in that great chain, which will link different individuals and countries into mutually friendly groups; by that time, science will abandon destructive work and calmly devote itself to solving the various problems that still face mankind.

I hope citizens will pay attention to listening. The station's call sign is XGOI, and the frequency is 900 kilocycles.

### Mayor Wu's Letter to the Citizens on New Year's Day of the Twenty-Sixth Year of the Republic

The way of heaven is vigorous, advancing unceasingly. The twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China has also passed with the great torrent of the times, becoming the historical trace of mankind. Today, on the day of the New Year's dedication in the twenty-sixth year, it happens to be one week after the safe return of our revolutionary leader Chairman Chiang. Getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, from adversity to prosperity, all of us citizens, how should we recognize and shoulder the task of our great history, and invigorate our spirits to complete the great cause of the revival of our Chinese nation? This is what we should earnestly strive for in addition to joyful celebrations.

I, Tiecheng, have been serving as the head of this city for five years. The progress of personnel is ultimately not as easy as the passage of time. Those who gallop like this, how can they not be vigilant! At the beginning of the year, looking back at the past, the past five years have indeed given people painful lessons. The policy guidelines of the past years and their progress have been declared, so I will not repeat them here. But have the things that I have declared over the years been fully implemented? This is especially something that cannot but be faithfully reviewed. With the importance of this city's position, there are more than ten thousand things that should be promoted and reformed; especially with the sharp increase in the duties of modern government and the complexity of urban problems, I, Tiecheng, although I have tried my best and worked hard, have ultimately failed to meet the original expectations due to limited financial resources and environmental constraints. The construction of the Great Shanghai metropolis is a great undertaking for hundreds of years. The municipal government was established just ten years ago, and the distance between past achievements and future ideals is still very far. Looking forward to the future, the road is long and the task is heavy, so we should especially agree with our citizens to work harder together.

Governance does not lie in many words, but in burying oneself in construction; construction does not value superficial appearances, but especially values being practical and realistic. Although national affairs are in a state of rapid progress, international situations are also tense. Municipal administration is a link in the entire national policy, so its construction should naturally take national revival as the premise, so that it can be a powerful unit in the process of the entire national construction and national revival. Therefore, in recent years, what I, Tiecheng, have strived to do, in addition to the general facilities that municipal administration should have, is to combine education, upbringing, and health as a consistent principle. Although the work in the future will be varied, in essence, it should still be easy. I respectfully base myself on this purpose and offer several points, hoping that my citizens will cooperate and encourage each other!

[1] Regarding material construction, first, the most important thing is to actively promote the National Economic Construction Movement. Chairman Chiang has already given incisive instructions on the importance of economic construction; contemporary scholars have also discussed it a lot, so I will not repeat it here. Matters concerning the National Economic Construction Movement in this city have been planned and carried out long ago; after the start of the year, it should be promoted more actively. All the projects that were determined in previous years that have not been completed on schedule, such as the improvement of agriculture in the suburbs, water and electricity transportation, and the expansion of other public undertakings, should be strived to be implemented in reality. Secondly, the solid implementation of labor services. The labor service in this city is currently underway, with the Labor Service Committee taking full responsibility, with the goal of service being the dredging of rivers, etc. This is beneficial to water conservancy and transportation, and the livelihood of farmers. Thirdly, the preparation of a large-scale exhibition. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government. It is planned to take advantage of the grand anniversary celebration to prepare a large-scale municipal exhibition and a new industrial and handicraft exhibition, first to prosper the urban area, and second to promote domestic products.

[2] Regarding social construction—in addition to continuing to promote civilian welfare undertakings and improving the livelihood of civilians; other things such as the formal opening of municipal hospitals and health test institutes; the continued addition of health offices in various places; the improvement of environmental sanitation and labor hygiene; the improvement of the lives of rickshaw pullers; and the construction of public auditoriums and crematoriums were originally planned for last year. All of these things, some of which are related to civilian welfare and some of which are related to the improvement of etiquette and customs, should all be strived to be realized one by one as far as financial resources allow.

[3] Regarding spiritual construction—First, the continued promotion of literacy education; I have already spoken in detail about this matter before, so I will not repeat it here. Secondly, the intensified implementation of civic training. Civic training in this city has already achieved considerable success; citizens have enthusiastically participated, and their spirit is especially unexpected. This year, in order to actively improve, it is planned to open a civic training cadre training institute, select citizens with better academic ability and physical strength, give them strict training, strengthen their physique, teach them skills, encourage their spirit, and enlighten their thinking, in order to cultivate sound and promising civic training cadre talents. Enlighten their thinking, in order to cultivate sound and promising civic training cadre talents. So that future civic training will be more effective; the spirit of citizens will be more sound, and they can bear the great mission of defending the country and reviving the nation.

All of the above is nothing new. However, the revival of the nation depends on strengthening national power; the great cause of saving the country cannot be achieved by taking risks and fluke. Just ask about cultivation, don't ask about harvest. One point of construction, one point of national power is strengthened; one point of effort, one point of national fortune is developed. Shanghai connects the north and the south, shielding the capital. Industry and commerce are the best in the country. The spirit of the citizens has a great influence. Its relationship with the entire nation is very profound. At the beginning of the year, on the occasion of getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, carrying on the past and opening up the future, all of us citizens should especially grasp their mission of the times, confirm their correct way of serving the country; avoid vanity, be down-to-earth, cooperate in harmony, and cooperate with all our strength; obey the entire national policy, bury ourselves in self-reliance construction, to complete the great cause of national revival!

### Shanghai Circles Jointly Telegraph Chiang Asking Him Not to Withdraw

After news spread that Chairman Chiang had resigned due to the Xi'an Incident, the entire country was alarmed. Various organizations in Shanghai had previously telegraphed requesting him to withdraw his resignation. Yesterday, another telegram was sent asking him to continue leading the Chinese people to complete the great task of national rejuvenation. The following are the texts of the various telegrams:

Yu Qiaqing's Telegram

Yesterday, Mr. Yu Qiaqing sent the following telegram to Chairman Chiang: "Respectfully to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing: I respectfully acknowledge receipt of the telegram and am delighted to hear of your well-being. Since the reports of your two resignations to the central government, your loyalty to the country is evident in your words. After reading them repeatedly, I am both admiring and respectful. This incident was sudden and unexpected, and it is certainly not something for which you should blame yourself. Examining historical records, your greatness of spirit is even more evident. The central government's sincere request for you to stay is based on the will of the people. Granting you a month's leave for recuperation allows you the opportunity for rest. However, at this time of great difficulty and with the end of the year approaching, your actions are of concern to all, both domestically and internationally. The extremely tense situation of recent days is proof of this. I deeply fear that misunderstandings may arise during your leave, which would be of great consequence to the country and its people. Regarding personal friendship, I sincerely wish you to take a temporary leave of absence and take care of your health in order to complete even greater undertakings. For the sake of the country and its people, we cannot do without your leadership for even a day. I sincerely submit this plea, and earnestly beg for your consideration. I am filled with trepidation. Yu Hede bows respectfully. World."

Chinese Labor Union

Telegram Requesting Chairman Chiang to Stay: "Respectfully to Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission in Nanjing: Thanks to your sincerity and influence, the Xi'an Incident has been resolved, and darkness has turned to light. We were looking forward to your great talent and vision to complete the great task of national rejuvenation. However, news has come that you suddenly intend to withdraw. We are filled with trepidation upon hearing this. At this time of national difficulty, we earnestly request that you continue to lead the masses and continue your efforts to console the people's hopes. As the year begins, we respectfully wish you happiness and prosperity. The Chinese General Labor Union bows respectfully. World."

Two Railway Party Branches

"The executive committee members read the Central News Agency dispatch yesterday, stating that Vice Chairman Chiang had resigned due to the Xi'an Incident. Upon hearing this, we were filled with trepidation. Therefore, we specifically telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters to forward to Vice Chairman Chiang our hope that he will consider the sincere support of the people and comrades of the entire party and not withdraw but continue to preside over the central government and complete the great task of revolution. At the same time, we telegraphed Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to express our congratulations. The contents are as follows: ㊀ Respectfully to Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission, Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing: Having repeatedly read the reports, we were shocked to learn that you had repeatedly resigned due to the Xi'an Incident. Upon hearing this, we were deeply alarmed. You have worked tirelessly for the country, for peaceful unification, for domestic pacification and foreign resistance, and for laying the foundation of the nation. This time, in the Shaanxi Incident, you once again influenced and transformed the stubborn and rebellious, guiding them toward peace and harmony, strengthening the people's support for the leader and increasing the reputation of the nation internationally. Your hard work and great achievements are unparalleled. Now that society is becoming more stable and the nation depends on preservation and transmission, we earnestly hope that you will consider the urgent plea of the masses to stay, immediately withdraw your resignation, continue to preside over the central government, and lead the Chinese people to complete the great task of national rejuvenation.

### Customs Revenue and Expenditure in the Twenty-Fifth Year of the Republic

Approved and announced by the Ministry of Finance

The total customs revenue (import tax, export tax, transit tax, tonnage dues, disaster relief surtax, and customs surtax) for the twenty-fifth year of the Republic amounted to 32,458,391.25 yuan in national currency. The total tax revenue for the twenty-fourth year was 31,551,972.03 yuan in national currency.

The total import tax was 11,283,568.07 gold units, of which 59% was collected in gold unit drafts, and the remainder was collected by converting the gold unit market price published by the customs on a daily basis into national currency.

The tax revenue of the customs in North China this year was greatly reduced compared to last year, mainly due to the rampant organized smuggling and tax evasion in the area, which was unprecedented. Customs anti-smuggling personnel were also unable to perform their duties as usual in the so-called non-militarized zone.

Foreign Debt and Indemnity

The principal and interest of the 1898 Anglo-German Supplementary Loan, the Boxer Indemnity, and the 1913 Reorganization Loan, which matured this year, were all paid in full from the customs revenue, totaling 76,728,395.72 yuan in national currency. The amount paid last year was 66,040,988.31 yuan in national currency.

The American Wheat and Flour Loan of the twentieth year of the Republic and the American Cotton and Wheat Loan of the twenty-second year of the Republic were consolidated on May 28 of this year. The principal and interest due this year, totaling 6,482,963.37 yuan in national currency, were all allocated from the disaster relief surtax revenue.

Domestic Debt Treasury Bonds

The total funds allocated this year for domestic debt treasury bonds secured by customs revenue amounted to 12,917,368.18 yuan in national currency, which has been allocated monthly from customs revenue to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for safekeeping and distribution. This fund includes the principal and interest of the Consolidated National Bonds of the Twenty-Fifth Year of the Republic (face value 146 million yuan), issued on February 1 to exchange and repay various old bonds, the principal and interest of the Reconstruction Bonds of the Twenty-Fifth Year of the Republic (face value 34 million yuan), issued on March 1, and the principal and interest of the Long-Term Financial Bonds of the Seventeenth Year of the Republic (face value 45 million yuan), which have not been merged into the Consolidated National Bonds.

Customs of the Three Northeastern Provinces

It must be stated that a portion of the principal and interest of the various debts and indemnities secured by customs revenue, which was previously borne by the Dalian and customs of the Three Northeastern Provinces, has not been remitted since these customs were seized in the summer of the twenty-first year of the Republic.

### Chen Zhonggao's Birthday Celebrations Used for Charity

Initiated by Yu Qiaqing and others

### Chiang Ting-wen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss the Xi'an Incident

Chairman Chiang Made Absolutely No Promises to Zhang; The Aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu Still Awaits Government Handling

The newly appointed Commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression, Chiang Ting-wen, returned to Nanjing from Xi'an this time and took the night train the night before last, departing Nanjing for Shanghai. He arrived at the North Station around 7:00 AM yesterday and went directly to his private residence on Anhe Temple Road to rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chiang yesterday and recorded the following conversation:

Chairman Chiang's Escape

According to Chiang, Chairman Chiang's confinement in Xi'an not only damaged the dignity of the leader but also ruined the honor that our country had gained internationally over the years. We met with Zhang Xueliang in Xi'an and repeatedly told him that we must not only restore the dignity of the leader but also seek to increase the dignity of the leader; we must not only restore the country's honor internationally but also seek to increase the country's honor internationally. Therefore, no conditions were discussed. If there were any opinions, they could be conveyed to the Chairman for consideration. Chairman Chiang's escape involved absolutely no written agreements or verbal promises.

Current Situation in Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces

After Zhang Xueliang arrived in Nanjing, he awaited punishment from the Central Government at the national gate. Yang Hucheng also absolutely obeyed the Central Government. Zhang and Yang's troops remained stationed in their original defense areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. Order in various places has gradually returned to normal. The subordinates of Director Zhu of the Gansu Pacification Commissioner's Office suffered many casualties in this incident. Currently, the aftermath issues in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces still await government handling.

Staying in Shanghai for a Medical Examination

I had a lot of hemoptysis in Xi'an, so I specifically asked the Chairman for leave to come to Shanghai for medical treatment. I will be admitted to the hospital for a physical examination soon and will not go elsewhere for the time being. When I will take office as the Commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Frontline Headquarters and whether I will go to Fujian have not yet been decided. The Chairman will return to Fenghua to handle funeral affairs for his deceased brother and take a short rest.

### Fang Shouyi Arrested and Interrogated for Issuing Bad Checks

Sentenced to a Fine of 100 Yuan; Compensation to the Plaintiff of 5,400 Yuan

Fang Shouyi, 38 years old, from Fenghua, the brother-in-law of Wu Yuncheng, a director of Dahua Bank from Zhejiang (resident at No. 5, Lane 177, Luban Road), and the brother of Fang Jida (Wu Yuncheng's wife), who is currently practicing as a female lawyer in Shanghai and manager of the Nanjing Xie Ming Mining and Chemical Plant. Fang previously entrusted Ge Changhe, a Suzhou native in his twenties (resident at No. 1, Lane 5, Ximen Road) and an employee of Yuan Maoyong Gold Shop on the top floor of Citibank on Jiujiang Road, to engage in speculative business at the yarn and cotton exchange. He instructed Yang to operate yarn and cotton, limited to 500 bales. From September to early November of last year, upon settling the accounts, Fang owed Yang 5,400 yuan. On October 16th and 18th, Fang issued two checks to Yang from the Nanjing Zhongnan Bank, dated the 26th and 28th of the same month. The check dated the 26th was for 1,700 yuan, and the check dated the 28th was for 3,700 yuan. When Yang presented the checks to the Nanjing Zhongnan Bank for payment, both checks were returned due to insufficient funds. Yang sought Fang to demand repayment, but he was unable to meet him for a long time. On the day before yesterday, Fang Shouyi suddenly asked his brother-in-law, Wu Yuncheng, to go to Yang's house to demand a discounted settlement of 1,600 yuan in exchange for the two checks. Yang, feeling that he had suffered too great a loss, feigned agreement and asked Fang to come and resolve the matter together. Fang, upon hearing this, happily went to Yang's place. Yang secretly reported to the French Concession police, accusing Fang of issuing bad checks. The captain approved the accusation and sent Detective Zhang Dongcheng to arrest and detain Fang Shouyi for investigation. Fang's sister, Fang Jida, a lawyer, upon learning this, rushed to the police station and requested permission for Fang to be released on bail, but the captain refused. Yesterday, the police sent Fang to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Magistrate Zhu Chuzhe questioned him. Fang, dressed in a Western suit with an otter fur coat, looked confident. First, Police Attorney Yuan Jiahong from the Police Affairs Department explained the case, filing charges under Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. The plaintiff, Yang Changhe, also testified about the defendant's issuing of checks and appointed a lawyer to file an incidental civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to repay the check amounts. When questioned, the defendant, Fang Shouyi, admitted to issuing the checks but said that there were various misunderstandings that he needed to clarify to the court. The judge stopped him, saying, "Since you admit to issuing the checks, there is no need to say irrelevant things. In Shanghai's financial circulation, the issuer should deposit the funds into the bank before the date of the check, for example, signing a check today with a date of January 15th. Otherwise, bringing it to court constitutes the crime of issuing bad checks." At this point, the court found the facts simple and clear and ordered the opening of the trial. First, the attorney from the Police Affairs Department argued, stating that the defendant had admitted to issuing bad checks, and requested that he be punished according to the law. After the defendant's lawyer, Fang Jida, and others defended him, they debated the private suit. The court immediately announced the judgment in court, sentencing Fang Shouyi to a fine of 100 yuan for issuing bad checks and intentionally exceeding his deposit. If he cannot pay the fine, he will be required to perform labor service, with 2 yuan equivalent to one day. The defendant must compensate the plaintiff 5,400 yuan in legal tender. The defendant, Fang, expressed agreement with the public prosecution judgment but disagreed with the private suit. The court ordered the defendant to provide a surety of 5,400 yuan, ready to appear when summoned, and await further instructions.

### Catholic Believers Pray for the Leader Today

Bishop Huijiliang of the Catholic Church in Shanghai has made outstanding achievements in managing church affairs and is particularly enthusiastic in guiding believers to love their country, respect their elders, and serve society. Recently, after returning from an inspection of Changshu and Taicang, he issued a notice to his subordinates, urging believers to pray for the leader on New Year's Day. The original text of the notice is as follows: "As the new year begins, and the freezing clouds fill the sky with sorrow, we believers, although we say that human determination can overcome nature, but with sincere and fervent prayers, the benevolent God will surely be moved with compassion and listen to our prayers. Therefore, we should pray for the Pope, who deeply loves China and has been reported to be seriously ill, beseeching God to protect him and grant him long life. Here on earth, we should also pray for China, because we have a great responsibility to the Creator, to our parents, and to our country. Therefore, praying for the country is precisely to show that we are fulfilling our national duty of patriotism. In addition to thanking God for allowing our leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to escape from danger in Xi'an and return to Nanjing, we should also continue to pray for our leader, so that the already unified China, under the guidance of the leader, will become stronger and enjoy peace and happiness."

### A Major Robbery Occurred at Jingyun Building on Beijing Road Yesterday Afternoon

Four Thieves Broke into the Building and Stole Over 4,500 Yuan; A Fierce Gunfight Ensued After Resisting Arrest, Resulting in the Death of Two Detectives and Injuries to Pedestrians

A major robbery occurred at Fifth Floor, Jingyun Building on 378 Beijing Road, yesterday morning around 11:20 AM, resulting in the theft of over 4,500 yuan. Detectives responded to the alarm and attempted to apprehend the robbers, leading to a fierce gunfight that resulted in the death of a Western detective and a gatekeeper detective. One robber was killed, one was captured, and stray bullets injured two pedestrians. Details are as follows:

A Large Sum of Money Attracted Thieves

Fifth Floor, Room 508 of Jingyun Building at 378 Beijing Road, was rented by the Liu Jingdetang Agency, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun. It included an internal and external accounting room and a reception room. Yesterday was the end of the month and near the Lunar New Year's Eve, so there was a large sum of money being handled, which attracted the attention of thieves. Around 11:20 AM yesterday morning, four men suddenly knocked on the door of the agency, falsely claiming that they wanted to rent a house at 226 Fuxiang Lane, Yunnan Road. At the time, the external accounting room knew that the house was indeed vacant and believed their story. They informed the men that the monthly rent was 88 yuan. The men said that it was too expensive and requested a lower price. The external accounting room seemed hesitant and was in the midst of negotiations when...

The Internal and External Accounting Rooms Were Robbed Clean

The four robbers immediately pulled out pistols and ordered silence. One robber retreated to guard the door of Room 508, one guarded the telephone, and the other two simultaneously forced the people in the agency into the reception room. The guard was ordered to watch over them with a gun while the other robbers demanded the keys to the safe and searched both the internal and external accounting rooms. In the external accounting room, they stole 1,000 yuan in banknotes, but they were not satisfied. They opened the safe and stole another 900 yuan in banknotes. Still unsatisfied, they rushed into the internal accounting room, opened the safe, and stole over 2,500 yuan in banknotes. In total, they stole over 4,500 yuan.

Tea Servants Secretly Reported; Gatekeeper Locked the Door

At this time, two tea servants, Wu Jinbin and Wen Akun, were returning from outside. When they reached the entrance of Room 508, they were spotted by the robber guarding the door, who ordered them to stop and forced them to wait by the fire escape with a gun. The robbers initially thought that the fire escape was a dead end, but it actually led directly to the lower floors. The two tea servants were very alert and noticed that the agency was being guarded by armed men and that people were in a panic. They sensed that something was wrong and secretly ran down the fire escape to inform the gatekeeper, Pan Shoulung, No. 2128. Upon receiving the news, Pan immediately locked the iron gate without making a sound, intending to rush to the nearby police stations on Beijing Road to report the incident and cooperate in the arrest.

Detectives Ascended; Thieves Descended; Encounter on Shaanxi Road

By chance, Western Detective Schleter, No. 2268, and Chinese Detective No. 3398 were patrolling the area. Pan immediately approached them to report the incident. The two detectives, upon hearing the news, instructed Pan to lead the way and rushed into Jingyun Building. They also instructed the elevator operator to stop the elevator on the lower floor and not allow it to go up. They immediately ascended the winding staircase with Chinese Detective No. 3398 and gatekeeper Pan Shoulung. They did not expect that the four robbers had already hidden the stolen banknotes in a paper hatbox and were exiting Room 508. Seeing that the elevator was not responding, they were also descending the winding staircase from the fifth floor and had reached the second floor. The two sides encountered each other at the corner of the winding staircase on the ground floor.

Two Detectives Were Killed Due to Being Outnumbered

When the robbers saw that they were detectives, they knew that the matter had been exposed and immediately opened fire. The Western and Chinese detectives were hit. Since there was nothing to rely on in that area, they retreated to hide by the elevator on the ground floor. In desperation, the robbers fired wildly, hoping to escape. The Western detectives guarded themselves with the existing risk, also fired three shots, and counterattacked the robbers. Because the number of detectives was too small and the robbers was to numerous, it was impossible to resist four firearms. The detectives were shot down each other step by step, and four robber bullets concentrated on the Western Detective Schleter and Gatekeeper Pan Shoulung, who recklessly resisted, were all murdered and fell near the ladder. All that remained was one Chinese Detective, No. 3398, on one side, and the robbers on the other, one pistol against four.

Two Thieves Captured After Concerted Pursuit

Seeing that the police fire was intermittent, knowing there was a casualty, the robbers took the opportunity to flee down the winding staircase, rushing out of the gate to the west. The Chinese Detective, No. 3398, also rushed out and blew the whistle loudly, calling for the alarm everywhere. Third, 165, 2975, and 3087, the Chinese detectives on duty at the nearby main street intersection, all rushed to the scene after hearing the news to jointly pursue the robbers. One thief was knocked down by the Chinese Detective, No. 2975, at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road. One thief was captured by the Chinese Detective, No. 3087, at the intersection of Shanxi Road. There were two thieves, who escaped. At this time, a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the police station had arrived earlier to search each checkpoint closely, but they did not have a trace of the two thieves.

The Deceased Will Be Given a Generous Pension

On one side, an urgent order was issued to the fire brigade to send ambulances to Jingyun Building and the intersection of Shandong Road, and ambulances were sent to the Gongji Hospital and Renji Hospital for treating the wounded Western and Chinese detectives and one wounded robber. However, all of them died on the way due to serious injuries. Western Detective Schleter died after a bullet hit his head, and the gatekeeper's skull was injured. The seven bullets hit the dead robber's body, and a thousand yuan from the original loot as well as a pistol were found. The remains of the two detectives have been sent to the mortuary, pending reports to the Sino-British authorities and judicial authorities for verification. At the same time, the police station will give the detectives a generous pension because they died in the line of duty.

Bullets Flew and Injured Pedestrians

The arrested thief was immediately taken to the police station. Under the strict interrogation by the captain, he admitted to conspiring to rob the building, and he confessed to the hiding place of his accomplices. The detectives, escorted and escorted, went to arrest the rest of the gang. The firefight between police and thieves on the day numbered no less than forty or fifty rounds. Bullets flew and pedestrians scrambled, but there were still two people who were injured by stray bullets. One was Feng Afu, a car driver from Ningbo, who was standing in nearby Car 8023, and was thirty years old with a right chest wound. The other was Y Afu, a chartered driver, wounded with an injury in his right arm, and it was also transported by ambulance to the Renji hospital to be treated.

### Continued Search for Counterfeit Currency Factory

Various Counterfeit Currencies Discovered; Over Forty Fake Seals

Liu Guangsheng, 31 years old, a native of Danyang, resident at No. 776, Bellere Road, French Concession, alias Liu Chang, was arrested on the morning of the day before yesterday near Tangjiawan, outside Laoximen, by plainclothes detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. 50 counterfeit one-yuan bills were found, and he was escorted to the Public Security Bureau. He confessed that the factory was located at No. 6, Renchang Lane, Lanweiai Road, French Concession. Police officers were dispatched with the French Concession police. The main culprit, Zhu Yulin (also known as Zhixiang), had fled after hearing the news. Two suspects, Liu Ziting and Jiang Yuqian, were arrested, and 19 counterfeit five-yuan bills of the Central Bank, 2 counterfeit five-yuan bills of the Guangdong Provincial Exchange, 3 counterfeit ten-yuan bills of an unknown bank, 20 counterfeit five-yuan bills of the Four Provinces Farmers Bank, and counterfeit one-yuan and ten-yuan bills, a counterfeit ten-yuan bill of the China Farmers Bank, and over 40 fake seals of bank presidents and managers were seized. The individuals and evidence were transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation and verification. Orders were issued to strictly arrest the fleeing main culprit and bring him to justice.

### British Consulate Issues Statement on the Case of the Indian Who Survived Hanging

The Rope Broke Because of the Sharp Edge of the Steel Beam of the Gallows; Mr. Atma Singh Has Regained Consciousness in the Hospital

Shanghai, December 31 (Reuters) - Sir Brenan, British Consul-General in Shanghai, has issued the following detailed announcement regarding the case of Indian Atma Singh who survived hanging: The Board of Inquiry, after questioning several witnesses and carefully examining the rope and execution chamber, found that the rope broke because of the relatively sharp edge of the steel beam of the gallows, and that no one had secretly replaced the rope. The Board is particularly satisfied with this. The layout of the execution chamber meets all the latest requirements of the London Home Office. The rope should not be tied to the gallows beam but to the chain hook below it. The executioner came to Shanghai on the order of the Hong Kong government, but he still insisted on using his usual method of tying the rope to the beam. The beam used in the Hong Kong gallows seems to be round, while the beam used in Shanghai is not round. The executioner and others did not expect that the edge of the steel beam could cut the rope, especially since this method had been used to hang a criminal this summer and no accident had occurred. The Board believes that the incident was an accident and that no one is to blame. According to another report, Indian Atma Singh, who was hanged at Ward Road Prison a few days ago and did not die because the rope broke, regained consciousness in the police hospital yesterday morning. He was able to sit up, eat nutritious food, and talk casually with others. Judging from the current situation, there is hope for recovery. As for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador, the decision on Mr. A's fate has not yet been announced yesterday.

### Four Western-Clad Robbers Impersonate Detectives to Extort Money

The victim fell for the ruse and went out to raise funds. The police received a report and surrounded the area to apprehend two men, while two others escaped.

Lu Ensheng, a 49-year-old Suzhou native, runs the Taifeng Silk Store at No. 21, Lane 25, Xiamen Road. At 7:45 p.m. the night before, four men in Western suits barged in, claiming to be detectives dispatched by the police to search for opium. One of them even produced a pair of handcuffs, as if to arrest Lu. Lu was greatly alarmed and tried to reason with them. The men demanded 600 yuan, but they eventually settled for 400 yuan. As Lu did not have the money, he borrowed 220 yuan in legal tender from his second landlord, Qian Xuanxian, and handed it over first. He also sent his old clerk, Xu A'er, out to borrow 200 yuan from the Jincheng Silk Store on Ningbo Road. However, on the way, Xu reported to the Chinese police that robbers were robbing his master's house, so he immediately reported it to the police. Upon hearing the report, the police urgently notified the police station by telephone. The police chief immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to No. 25, Xiamen Road, to surround No. 21 and rush in. They arrested the extortionists Gu Zhuqin from Tongzhou and Ding Jinzhi from Wuxi on the spot. The other two escaped with the money. They were taken to the police station for detention and were escorted to the First Special Court Criminal Division yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 346 of the Criminal Law and stated the facts of the case. When questioned, Ding Jinzhi confessed that he ran the Dahua Chemical Factory. In June of this year, he sold chemical towels to Lu Ensheng for 16 yuan. This time, he went with Gu Zhuqin to collect the debt, which was true, and there was no extortion or impersonation of public officials. Gu Zhuqin confessed that he was the owner of the Lida Printing House and that Ding had invited him to collect the debt the night before. Liang Bohua was hired as a lawyer to defend them. After Judge Feng verified the confessions, he ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for next Wednesday.

### Worker Shot Five Times

The reason is unknown. Life is in danger.

Zhou Pingxiu, a 28-year-old native of Taixing in the Xitanjiadu shantytown, works for a living. At about 7 p.m. last night, he was suddenly attacked by several thugs with handguns who broke into his house and fired five shots at him. Zhou was hit by two bullets in the head and face, two bullets in the shoulder blades, and one bullet in the leg. He was seriously injured, bleeding, and fell to the ground unconscious. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs fled in a rush. The Guangfu Road police station in charge of the area immediately dispatched police to hunt down the thugs, but they had already disappeared without a trace. Zhou Pingxiu was sent to the hospital for treatment by an ambulance dispatched by the police station. It is said that his injuries are critical and his life is in danger. As for the reason why Zhou was shot and who the murderer was, when asked about the Caojiadu Branch, the branch replied that they had not yet received an investigation report from the branch office, so the truth could not be ascertained.

### Yang Yushan and Two Others Convicted of Fraudulently Obtaining Money Through Litigation

Yang Yushan sentenced to one year and two months. Wang and Sun each sentenced to eight months.

Yang Yushan, a Shaoxing native and owner of the Yang Fuxing firewood and coal shop outside the Shanghai Local Court, also co-founded the Zhengchi Law Firm at No. 1, Renlin Lane, Huanghe Road, in the French Concession. He engaged in soliciting lawsuits, along with Wang Bingquan, who used to set up a character-splitting stall outside the court and is now a newly appointed clerk of the court, and Sun Yuchen, who lives at No. 14, Tiande Lane, Haichao Road. In May of last year, the deputy abbot of Longhua Temple, Monk Hongkui, sodomized the temple worker Yang Shouchang and was sentenced to three years and two months of imprisonment. Yang Yushan impersonated a court clerk and fraudulently obtained 500 yuan from Hongkui's disciple, Great Monk Daheng. Unexpectedly, he clashed with Wang Bingquan, who was of the same kind. The court received a letter of accusation from Kui Fa, signed with his name. The deceased chief clerk Xuan Maohe arrested Yang. Yang also confessed that Wang Bingquan had done it. Prosecutor Mei searched the Zhengchi Law Firm and found evidence of Yang Yushan, Wang Bingquan, and Sun Yuchen jointly extorting money in the case of Du A'kang suing his wife, Ding A'ying, for adultery with Liu Linsheng. Wang and Sun were arrested and imprisoned. The court reopened the hearing and interrogated them again. The three men slandered each other. The prosecutor investigated and confirmed the facts with the victims and prosecuted them together. After repeated examinations and debates by Judge Zhang Peilu, the verdict was announced at 3 p.m. on New Year's Eve.

Wang Bingquan and Sun Yuchen were each sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for accepting money. After the sentences were pronounced, they were ordered to be remanded in custody.

### Large Batch of Dodge Trucks Arrives in Changsha from Shanghai

Reaching Destination by Highway

Recently, the river water has dropped sharply, making navigation difficult. Heavy cargo cannot be shipped. The China Motor Company in this city just received an order from the Changsha Highway Bureau of Hunan to order two batches of Dodge trucks. The company, considering the inconvenience of water transportation, specially switched to highway transportation. The trip was 872 miles. The Dodge trucks drove day and night, taking only four days to arrive safely at their destination. However, they had to cross the river twelve times along the way. These Dodge trucks are equipped with a reserve oil tank with a capacity of 13 gallons, so even when driving through remote areas of the mainland, refueling is very economical and convenient. According to our country, Dodge is the first to deliver goods directly to the destination via such a long-distance highway. The picture shows a part of the Dodge trucks before departure.

### State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Establishes New Regulations on Crew Treatment

From now on, promotions, demotions, and dismissals will be implemented according to the regulations.

The crew treatment of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established in the early years of the Republic of China, in 1934, when Liu Hongsheng was in office, and the crew leave regulations were established as a reward and punishment for diligence and laziness in service. By the end of the first performance appraisal period this year, 109 crew members had been awarded. Since Cai Zengji took over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, at the repeated request of the driving and engine departments, a fundamental law on promotion, demotion, and dismissal was quickly established regarding crew treatment. It also stipulates the crew's salary and promotion regulations to be observed and to encourage the hearts of the people.

The payment of type A and type B salaries differs by about four levels. For the driving department, the captain of type A starts from 300 yuan to 500 yuan, and type B starts from 240 yuan to 440 yuan. The salary of a type A captain of a Yangtze River ship shall not exceed 440 yuan, and type B shall not exceed 400 yuan. The minimum salary for the chief mate is 140 yuan, and the maximum is 220 yuan. The minimum salary for the second mate is 80 yuan, and the maximum is 120 yuan. The minimum salary for the third mate is 60 yuan, and the maximum salary is 75 yuan.

### Female Worker Flogged, Patrol Officer Questioned and Beaten

Inside the Longmao Warehouse in Lujiazui, Pudong, a large number of female workers from various flower shops usually pick flowers. However, these female workers inevitably covet small profits and take the opportunity to steal flower clothes out of the warehouse when they leave work. Recently, Shanghai Sanyi Flower Shop, because they suspected that the police guarding the warehouse were too lax, planned to deal with the flower-stealing workers themselves. At 6 p.m. the night before, a female worker, Wu Yangshi, was found by Han Fuchang, an employee of the Sanyi Flower Shop, to be hiding a bunch of flower clothes, weighing about a few taels. He tied her to a telephone pole and flogged her. The woman screamed for help. Wang Xiangui, a pier patrol officer, stepped forward to inquire. He disagreed with Han and they had an argument. The police officer was hit and his police hat was knocked off, and his uniform was torn slightly. Wang was furious and hurried back to the Pudong Branch to report. The branch ordered Han to be summoned to the branch to inquire about the reason for the assault. That night, the compradore of the warehouse sent a letter to the branch stating that it was a misunderstanding. A storm subsided. Han was released on bail by the compradore.

Yan Yuying, a woman from Suzhou, was formerly married to Liu Chengru, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun traveling in Shanghai, as a concubine. Later, because she was not tolerated by the principal wife, she left. Yan later claimed that Liu's son, Dongbin, was born to her while she was married to Liu, and applied to the court for mediation, ordering Liu Chengru and Liu Dongbin to provide support. Subsequently, the mediation was successful. Yan admitted that Dongbin was actually born to Liu's other concubine, Ban. The record was made. Yan then requested the court to confirm that Dongbin was her biological child, but the case was dismissed and finalized. Yan started another wave and requested again to confirm that the mediation record was invalid, but also failed. She is currently appealing in the third instance. Yan suddenly filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing Liu Dongbin of injuring an elder relative, claiming that Liu had beaten her on the 13th of the month. The First Special Court has summoned Liu Dongbin, who hired lawyers Gao Junxiang and He Shimai to appear in court and declare that Liu Dongbin did not beat Yan. They also stated that Yan's identity had been repeatedly involved in lawsuits and had failed. Although she is now appealing in the third instance, her hopes are very slim, so she has filed this lawsuit. However, the establishment of this case depends on Yan's identity. Since the case is in the third instance, it is difficult to proceed with this case. Therefore, they requested that the proceedings be suspended. The court instructed to wait for the case file to be transferred for review. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in the First Criminal Division. Liu Dongbin was still represented by lawyers Gao and He. Judge Feng immediately announced that this case should be conducted after the judgment of the third instance, because it is necessary to consider the identity of the plaintiff, which is the key to constituting an elder relative. He then ruled that the proceedings of this case should be suspended.

### Chen Qiucao Painting Exhibition Opens Tomorrow

Painter Chen Qiucao has devoted himself to Chinese and Western painting for eighteen years. He has always been solitary and self-respecting, and does not seek fame and fortune. He has held specialized exhibitions of pastel paintings at the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Association and the former Municipal Government Building, which have been well received. In the autumn of 1928, he founded the White Goose Painting Society and Painting Research Institute in the North City, and published books such as the White Goose Annual, the Art Semi-Monthly, the Sketch Collection, and the Pastel Painting Collection. His paintings are vivid, the colors are strange and elegant, and they are magnificent and beautiful, with special strengths. Later, he suffered damage from the Shanghai Incident, and all his works over the years were burned. In recent years, while trying to restore the White Goose Society's affairs, he has also been deeply aware of the need to raise national awareness and extricate himself from passive concepts in art protection in the face of the dangerous situation of the country. He has worked hard to write and has gradually accumulated a lot, but he is still humble and unwilling to show it to others. This time, the Incursion Incident occurred, and all circles rose up to support it. Chen felt that it was his national duty, so he took out his recent works, including more than 100 points of ink, oil, pastel, sketch, and decorative design, and held an exhibition at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company at the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road. He plans to donate half of the proceeds from the sale of tickets and paintings as a comfort donation. The exhibition period is set from January 2 to 10. The viewing time is from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day. Each ticket costs only one dime, and for the sake of unified reception, gift tickets are distributed in advance, and you can enter at any time with the ticket. There will be no pre-exhibition. The picture shows Chen's recent oil painting, "The Night Before the Outbreak."

### Shanghai Neon Light Manufacturing Industry (Continued)

— Edited by the China Credit Information Service

(Survey of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, No. 41)

㊃ Mercury: Available in all pharmacies.

㊄ Electrical Wire: Rubber wire is the most suitable. Each coil is approximately 100 yards and currently costs around $15. Local electrical appliance factories can manufacture their own.

㊅ Iron Shells and Frames: Iron shells are used to house various finished characters and designs. Iron frames are used for larger advertisements. In addition to the above raw materials, paint is also very important.

The manufacturing process begins with sketching and scaling up the design as needed. Glass tubes are then bent according to the design. When bending the glass tubes, gas (i.e., city gas) is used to soften the glass, and air is injected to maintain the round shape of the bend. After bending, a vacuum pump is used to evacuate the air inside the tube, creating a vacuum. Then, depending on the desired color, gas and mercury are simultaneously injected into the tube using a gas injection machine. The ends are sealed with glass bubbles, which have thin copper wires protruding, which are used to transmit electricity and are called "electrodes." Thin copper skin is used to seal both ends. The electrodes are then connected to a transformer, allowing current to pass through. This will cause the lights to illuminate.

Neon lights can save half the electricity compared to ordinary lights. However, they are prone to bursting during manufacturing, and one careless mistake can ruin the entire effort. In addition to the quality of the raw materials, the experience of the engineer and the proper mixing of gases are also important factors.

Three, Current Status of Factories

Currently, there are fifteen neon light manufacturers in the city. Among them, eleven are currently operating, two have ceased manufacturing but the company has not been dissolved. Details are as follows:

[A) Currently Operating:

㊀ Oriental New Red Electric Light Company: Established in the summer of the 15th year of the Republic. The factory is located at No. 18 Xinghe Li, Jing'an Temple Road, and the sales office is located at No. 407 Jing'an Temple Road. It was founded by Zhang Huikang, a prominent figure in the engineering field. Originally organized as a limited partnership company with shareholders Ren Shigang, Chen Junwu, Luo Qingfan, Qian Jichuan, Sun Tongjun, and Zhang Huikang, with a capital of 60,000 yuan. Later, due to business development, the original capital was insufficient, so in the 23rd year of the Republic, the capital was increased to 120,000 yuan, and the organization was changed to a limited company. Ren Shigang serves as chairman, with Luo Qingfan, Qian Jichuan, and Chen Junwu as managing directors. Xiang Xiamin, Sun Tongjun, Yang Jing, Wu Jinqing, and others serve as directors, and Zhang Huikang serves as both director and manager. The machinery and equipment are valued at over 20,000 yuan. In addition to the local market, sales have expanded to Pingjin, Jinghan, and other places.

㊁ Liyan Electrical Company: Established in the 18th year of the Republic. A US-owned company with a registered capital of US$624,000 and a paid-up capital of US$212,000. The factory was initially located at No. 89 Beikaier Road, and the sales office was located at No. 269 East Broadway. Organized as a limited company. The current directors are A McClure, R.E. Lunkley, M.E. Vittaly, C.M. Campbell, L. E. Gale, W. P. T. Holingsworth, and Mr. Guo Baoshu. The current general manager is M.E. Vittaly, and the deputy manager is Miss Mason. The factory and sales office have now been merged and relocated to No. 534, the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Albert. Their business also includes local and foreign markets, with local and foreign merchant firms as the main customers. The factory's facilities are quite complete, and it usually employs about 40 to 50 workers. In July of last year, the factory invented a Glo-Dial Clock made with neon tubes. It is said that the neon makes it glow, and it can be seen clearly from 100 yards away in public places. (To be continued)

### On China Will Not Perish (1)

— Pan Gongzhan

In the past five years of severe national crisis, many patriots have been deeply saddened by the shrinking territory and the rampant violence. Consequently, they have moved from pessimism to despair, from despair to depression, and from depression to considering themselves as citizens of a doomed nation! A year ago, someone even wrote a booklet titled "On China's Inevitable Perishing," which was openly sold in the market. This kind of argument naturally suited the taste of those who considered themselves citizens of a doomed nation, so it spread like wildfire, and people competed to recite it. Now, when the national peace and unity were about to be realized, and the resistance against the enemy and the suppression of bandits were indeed on the verge of victory, the unfortunate event of Zhang Xueliang's rebellion in Xi'an, which led to the kidnapping of the nation's only leader, suddenly occurred. As a result, the mentality that China would eventually be doomed to perish has grown among some Chinese people, who believe that there is no hope for salvation.

In fact, China can avoid perishing, but if the false and evil rumors of "On China's Inevitable Perishing" are spread and become a public belief, then China will truly perish. Why? Sun Yat-sen said, "The nation is the accumulation of people, and people are the vessels of the heart." If Chinese people lose their self-confidence, abandon themselves to despair, and consider themselves inferior races who should be naturally eliminated, then how can China avoid perishing? Therefore, to prevent China from perishing, we should first extinguish the evil rumors of China's inevitable perishing and establish the self-confidence that China will not perish. This is a major task in establishing "psychological national defense" today.

The ancients said, "A country that always has enemies from abroad will perish;" and also said, "Adversity builds a nation." In these years of national crisis, we have never seen signs that China will inevitably perish. Instead, we have discovered that the opportunity for national construction and revival has been triggered by the national crisis. Furthermore, by observing the national situation in the two weeks after Zhang Xueliang's rebellion, we have discovered that our country has indeed possessed the necessary conditions for organizing a modern nation. It can be seen that the wise sayings of the ancients are absolutely true. This is not empty talk; there are facts to prove it.

First, the Chinese people's belief in the government and their support for the leader have become stronger day by day because of the current national crisis. We know that when a country transitions from danger and weakness to self-reliance and revival, it certainly needs great unity, and this great unity certainly needs a great leader. The power generated by the unity of the whole nation under the great leader is the power to resist foreign aggression, save the nation, build the country, and revive it. The Chinese people have thoroughly awakened in the recent five years of national crisis after the "September 18th Incident" and have eradicated the bad habit of not believing in or worshipping leaders, transforming themselves into believers and followers of the leader. At this time, if anyone publishes remarks that are suspicious or critical of the leader, any young people with national consciousness will definitely not be fooled into believing them again. Even in this rebellion by Zhang Xueliang, no matter what reasons he held, the fact that he kidnapped Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the national leader, has already made a big mistake and completely failed. The whole country, men and women, old and young, regardless of region or occupation, none does not hate the rebellious general's madness, and none does not pray for the safe return of the leader. As long as we see the joy and dancing of the people across the country on the evening of December 25th when they learned that the leader was out of danger, we can know where the public opinion lies. Because everyone feels that emerging or reviving countries such as Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Turkey have all achieved success through efforts under the guidance of a leader, and the results of our five years of arduous struggle have also been completely achieved under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. This is a clear fact. We have learned from the facts in the national crisis and deeply know that separation and disunity lead to national destruction, while unity and concerted efforts are the way to revival. Therefore, all heterodox and high-sounding arguments and divergent actions, no matter how flowery and self-aggrandizing they may be, are rejected by the national consensus and will not be allowed to exist in the country. This great achievement can be said to be entirely due to foreign aggression. Now, if one is a Chinese person who obeys commands and strives for progress, he will definitely have the self-confidence that China will never perish. And after the test of this unfortunate incident in Xi'an, the whole country unanimously condemned Zhang Xueliang and supported Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which can further strengthen our belief that "China will not perish"!

Second, in the past ten years, especially in the five years of national crisis, China's national construction has made great progress. When I say this, some people must be suspicious, thinking that the territory has been occupied, sovereignty has been infringed, foreign aggression has been so serious, and emergencies can happen at any time, and people's lives and property are often subject to unexpected destruction. Under these circumstances, what progress can the country have? But I still want to say: the progress China has made in these ten years is absolutely true, and there are facts to prove it. Precisely because China's construction has progressed, it has inevitably suffered aggression from ambitious imperialist countries. In the hearts of the aggressors, they only hope that China will lag behind, regress, and never progress, so that it can be their semi-colony. Therefore, the occupation of territory, the infringement of sovereignty, the seriousness of foreign aggression, and the outbreak of emergencies are all inevitable reactions that come with China's efforts to progress. However, this kind of reaction can only be said to be the "dystocia" of the new China or the young China, and it will ultimately not be able to prevent its birth. (To be continued)

HSBC's official exchange rate remained unchanged for both the U.S. and the U.K., and it was still stable. Chinese merchants and Japanese banks vigorously sold Japanese exchange. However, because the silver balance tax rose by 1 cent, the Bank of China maintained the Japanese exchange, and Japanese banks exited and re-entered. Therefore, although the Japanese exchange was firm, the process was still smooth. Moreover, foreign banks took advantage of the cheap price to accept U.S. dollars. The situation also showed a sideways trend at noon, because Japanese banks crammed out shillings, and foreign banks were also happy to take them. There was a lack of large-scale activity in the afternoon. Chinese merchants bought U.S. dollars and crammed out Japanese exchange, and the exchange was done by Japanese banks. By the closing, the selling price for the near term was 1 shilling 2 pence 53125 for the British exchange rate and 29 yuan 75 for the American exchange rate, which was the same as the previous closing price for both the U.S. and the U.K. Chinese merchants slightly crammed out.

### Securities

Government Bonds Still Appear Promising at Year-End

Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the government bond market was approaching the Lunar New Year's Eve. The market situation was extremely stable. The market was also affected by the end of the year, and most transactions were closed out. Due to the stability of the situation, the surface trend was quite promising, and large investors were still slowly absorbing, so the market price rose sharply. Although some bullish investors were also emerging, the overall market sentiment was promising, with no signs of weakening. Type A government bonds rose sharply again, reaching a new high of 76 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. The reason for today's opening was that it was the Lunar New Year and there would be a four-day holiday, with trading resuming on the 5th. Yesterday morning, the 35th series was actively traded, and Series E and D both rose by 5 fen to 3 jiao. Many of the Series C 50th series and others emerged, and the market price weakened by 1 jiao and 2 jiao and a half. Type A bonds were actively absorbed by the 3rd series, and the forward price rose by 5 fen. In the second session, bullish and bearish investors mutually opposed, and the market situation also tended to stabilize. Series 10 and 47 were sold, and Series 50 and 35 continued to be purchased. Except for Series C, which fell slightly by 5 fen to 2 jiao and a half, the rest all rose by 1 to 2 jiao. In the afternoon opening, the trend first weakened and then strengthened. Series E and D, such as 71 and 43, were sold and fell by about 1 jiao. After Series C, Series 50 and 5 were keenly bought, and they rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao and a half. At the closing, due to the inconsistent entry and exit of retail investors, the market price also had slight differences of 5 fen to 1 jiao, with 43 being sold more. As a result of the whole day, except for Type B and D forward bonds which fell slightly by 1 to 2 jiao, the rest all rose by 1 jiao to half a yuan. The comparison of their rises and falls, highs and lows is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)

### Yarn and Cotton

Spot Yarn Sales Are Quiet

Customers are very active in futures trading. The standard yarn and cotton market is closed as usual, but spot traders still gather in the market.

According to the statistics of yesterday's purchases of spot and futures yarn by various guilds, 1,915 bales were sold, and the selling price rose by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of each guild are as follows:

Spot U.S. Cotton Demand Shows Improvement

Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened sluggish. However, domestic and foreign peers bought in, and there were not many sellers. The price of each month rose by 4 to 6 points. Later, cotton farmers hedged their sales and bullish investors closed out, and the market price slightly retreated. The market was unable to confirm rumors about the government selling loan cotton. There were few new buyers, and the market price did not fluctuate much. The spot market was firm, and demand also showed some improvement. The cloth market was quiet, and the closing price was stable. Spot prices rose by 9 points, and futures prices rose by 7 to 11 points. Spot British cotton fell by 7 points, and futures fell by 12 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to continued purchases by sellers, but then weakened due to cotton farmers hedging their sales and bullish investors closing out. Finally, the market price rose again due to strong buying power. The price of Pingoer rose by half a rupee, the price of Aogula fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and the price of Bai Luo Xi remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (30th telegram).

### Grains

River Rice Arrivals Were Not Strong Yesterday

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were scarce due to the end of the year for the Lunar New Year. There were only more than 30 ships, of which more than 20 were Bo Dao. Transactions were mostly for social purposes, so there was no change in the market situation, and everything remained stable. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice, Yang Jian, and Yin Yuan remained unchanged. The total number of packages purchased was more than 2,000 packages of Bo Dao.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various roads under the river were sparse, about 16 or 17 ships. Due to the Lunar New Year's closing, the prices offered by the shops in the market were limited, and transactions were average. The high-quality Bai Jing rice was slightly absorbed by the hoarders, and the market price was promising. The price of medium-quality Bo Dao remained stable. The price of Yang Bu Du Jian was tightened by 3 to 5 fen, and the price of Bai Yuan was close to Jiao. The prices of other goods also showed a tightening trend. Also, the north and south rice shops will be closed for three days from the Lunar New Year's Day as usual, and will open as usual on the 4th.

Customer Xian's Sales Are Very Smooth

Yesterday, the digestion of customer Xian and customer Yuan was very active, but the arrivals decreased due to the Lunar New Year, and the market sentiment was even more promising. Yesterday, the sales were entirely from purchases by the street and hoarders. Neither the north nor the south gangs inquired about it. However, the street's appetite was very greedy, and the cargo owners were not in a hurry to sell, so the price continued to rise by 5 to 6 fen to 1 jiao and a half. The total number of transactions for the day was 3,710 packages of Jiangxi rice, 2,200 packages of Hunan rice, 700 packages of Han Cao, 1,122 packages of Wen Jia Yong Shao rice, and the rest were not sold.

The Yellow Soybean Market Is as Booming as Usual

Yesterday, the yellow soybean market rose again and again. Although Dalian was closed for the past two days, private telecommunications still reported tight prices, so the market was quite booming. Oil mills and inland truckers were excited about the environment, and the arrivals and stocks were scarce. The situation seemed unlikely to ease during these three days of holiday. As a result, the market continued to rise by 5 to 6 fen compared to the previous market. The total number of transactions was 7 vehicles of Bengbu soybeans, and the price rose from 6 yuan and 1 jiao to 6 yuan, 1 jiao and a half. There were 3 vehicles of Tieling soybeans, and the price was pulled to 6 yuan, 3 jiao and 2 fen. There was 1 vehicle of Tongliao soybeans, and the price was 6 yuan, 1 jiao and 8 fen. There were 2 vehicles of Siping Street soybeans, and the price was 6 yuan, 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao and 2 fen, and 3 vehicles of Niuzhuang green soybeans, from 6 yuan and 8 fen to 6 yuan and 4 jiao.

### Silk and Tea

Silk Transactions Are Scarce Both Domestically and Internationally

Yesterday was the Lunar New Year's Eve, and the overseas silk market was slightly quiet. The holding prices of New York Japanese silk and Chinese silk each fell by about 2 fen. The market price of the exchange rose slightly by 1 fen to 1 fen and a half. The market in Shanghai was quite quiet yesterday, and there were few transactions with foreign firms. The silk market will not be active until the 5th of January, when Western merchants open. The Yokohama silk market will not be active until the 6th.

### Piece Goods

Cotton Cloth Merchants Are Mostly Speculating on Business on Lunar New Year's Eve - The Market Price Has Risen Without Falling

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was generally optimistic due to the continuous rise in spot and futures yarn and thread. Futures speculation was particularly strong. Japanese and foreign firms increased their selling prices. Sijunzi Serge, Juxian Village Straight Tribute Satin of domestic and foreign cotton mills increased by 1.25 li per yard, and more than 100 boxes were still traded. They were all February and March futures. The spot selling price also echoed the increase, raising 2.5 li per yard. The white goods market price was also raised by 5 fen per bolt, and the spot price was slightly lower than the futures price by about Jiao. Yesterday was the last delivery period for this month's goods, and the delivery was very busy. Dyers and wholesalers in this street absorbed fine cloth quite vigorously, and the selling price increased by 5 fen to 1 jiao per bolt. The other fine twills and raw cloth increased by 5 fen, and bleached cloth increased by 1 to 2 jiao. The price of coarse cloth, coarse twills, and blue cloth remained stable. Although the thread price was very high, Straight Tribute, Serge, and Line呢 were not active in sales, so they lacked rising power. Only the selling price of Dong goods has been brought up by futures. Various transactions in the market were mostly speculative, and the actual sales of each road were very quiet due to the Lunar New Year's Eve.

Yuan Fang Piece Goods Prices Are Still Firm

Yesterday was the 3021st auction of Yuan Fang Foreign Company in this port. Five types of products were displayed: Western satin, Yuan velvet, straight tribute呢, feather silk, and foreign red cloth, totaling 46 brands and 62 boxes. Although the market shape coincided with the end of the year during the closing period, the bid prices fluctuated compared with the previous period, but the rise and fall were not large. Because the customer gang and the port's sales were still active, Western satin was auctioned in 5 brands. The price of Fox and Ox brands rose by 1.25 jiao per yard, and the price of Lion and Monkey brands fell by 6 fen. The two Yuan velvet brands saw slight inferiority, the straight tribute呢 rose by 2 fen, and the price of each bolt of feather silk was higher than the previous period. The Eighteen Sons brand rose by 1 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, the Butterfly Immortal rose by 1 yuan, and the Nine Linked Lanterns and Eight Soldiers brands rose by 6 to 7 jiao. The Bamboo Forest brand fell by 1 yuan, and the Haitian Ci Le, Flower Candle, Kuai Li, and 4 brands fell by about half a yuan. The rest rose or fell by 3 to 5 jiao. The foreign red cloth was 5 pounds of goods. Although it was light weight, it was the only one to show the price due to the shortage of goods in the market and the competition for purchase in the industry.

### Metals

British Tinplate Inventory Is Surprisingly Depleted

British tinplate has seen trading activity recently. Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Fujian and other gangs have all been buying, and manufacturers in this street have also been buying and selling a lot, so transactions have been quite strong. However, the goods are not coming in, and the inventory is surprisingly depleted. People's hearts are consolidated, and the market is expanding. The standard market price is much firmer than before. At the moment, the market price for single-linked is estimated at 21 yuan per box, and the variable-linked is sold at 41 yuan and 5 jiao. According to overseas pricing, single-linked is sold at 20 shillings and 6 pence, and variable-linked is sold at 41 shillings. It is heard that colleagues have also ordered more than a thousand boxes.

### Special Feature

The Production, Sales, and Manufacturing of Qihong (Continued 4)

The price of tea fluctuates indefinitely due to changes in the foreign exchange rate, as mentioned earlier. Our country is a silver-using country, while most of the tea-consuming countries are gold-using countries. Qihong is mostly exported to the UK, so the fluctuation of the exchange rate between silver dollars and British pounds directly affects the price of tea. In the past ten years, the price of silver has fluctuated indefinitely, resulting in endless changes in the price of tea. The lower the price of silver, the higher the price of tea; conversely, the higher the price of silver, the lower the price of tea. Qihong is mainly sold to the UK, so the market price is closely related to the London exchange rate. The following table is based on the Shanghai Commodity Price Monthly's index and reciprocal of the exchange rate against London in the past eleven years:

Table of the Average Exchange Rate Index and Reciprocal Against London in the Past Eleven Years (1926 = 100)

From the previous table, it can be seen that after 1926, there was a trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap. This reached its peak in 1931, so the exchange rate index against London also fell from 100 in 1926 to 46.9 in 1931. In other words, the British pound was expensive and the Chinese currency was cheap, so even though the market price of Chinese tea in the British market was the same, the exchange rate between London and Shanghai in 1931 fell by more than half compared to 1926, so the price of tea also increased by more than double. If we observe the rise and fall of the reciprocal of the London exchange rate, it is almost completely in line with the price of tea, so we can know the deep relationship between the exchange rate and the price of tea.

The change in the price of tea is difficult to escape the control of the law of supply and demand, but in recent years, the world's supply and demand of black tea has already shown a trend of overproduction. The price of black tea generally trended downward, and the decline was even greater in 1933. Due to excessive inventory, the three major black tea countries of India, Sri Lanka, and the Dutch East Indies agreed to establish a production and sales restriction agreement to save the fate of black tea and maintain the price of tea, hoping to see results within five years. Since its implementation, four years have passed in an instant. Although black tea inventory has decreased slightly, it is still difficult to expect the price of tea to rise. Chinese black tea is one part of the world's black tea. The rise and fall of the market price is governed by the international market price, so the international market price of Qihong tea has not changed excessively in recent years. The reason for the rapid changes in domestic market prices in recent years is actually dominated by the exchange rate.

Since the government implemented currency reform on November 4 last year, the exchange rate has stabilized. For the past year, except for the exchange rates against countries such as France and Switzerland, which have changed due to changes in the currency policies of those countries, the exchange rates against countries such as the UK and the US have been able to remain unchanged. Therefore, the pain of the exchange rate affecting the price of tea in the past may not occur in the future. The market price of tea leaves will entirely depend on the supply and demand situation and quality. (To be continued)

The Prospects of Life Insurance in Our Country

The world is mutable and human affairs are uncertain. Therefore, those of us who have the obligation to support our families should prepare for a rainy day and seek security and protection as early as possible to prepare for unforeseen events and life in old age. Thus, life insurance has emerged to meet the needs of life. Marine insurance for ships and fire insurance for properties are all about preventing problems before they occur and seeking safety. However, water and fire are not constant, and human efforts are often sufficient to defend against them, and some may never encounter them in their lifetime. But human life is finite, and death is inevitable. Even with robust health, sickness and old age are unavoidable. How can there be techniques to return to youth or revive the dead? From this, it can be seen that the need for life insurance surpasses that of water and fire insurance.

A wise man once said, "When the people are well-off, wealth is stored among them." Furthermore, foreign economic experts also use the size of people's savings to predict the prosperity or decline of a country's financial resources. Life insurance is a system of storing wealth among the people. According to recent statistics, the percentage of the American population who hold life insurance is over 60%, and in Japan, one in every thirty people holds life insurance. The average life insurance amount held by each person in the United States is more than 1,600 yuan, while the average life insurance amount held by each person in Japan is 100 yuan. Looking back at the life insurance business in our country, only one in 10,000 people holds life insurance, and the average insurance amount per person is only a few jiao. Comparing us to them, we are far behind, and it is truly immeasurable. Since so many people in the United States and Japan hold life insurance, national construction and rural industries have been fully developed and made significant progress due to the pooling of small insurance premiums. If you don't believe me, observe what follows. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in the United States has total assets of $3,867,601,191.39, and New York Life Insurance Company has assets of $2,001,094,312.02. There are more than 300 life insurance companies in the United States. Considering only these two companies, the greatness of their assets and the abundance of their resources are difficult for financial or industrial organizations in our country to match. Japanese commercial life insurance companies have total assets of 2,175 million yuan, and the government-run postal life insurance has total assets of 759,899,900 yuan. The total assets of both government and commercial companies are more than 3 billion yuan. The assets owned by life insurance companies are mostly the premiums collected, which are entrusted to these companies to invest in the most stable industries of the country.

I believe that a nation must be wealthy before it can be strong, and a nation must be strong to become wealthy. This is an immutable truth. Life insurance is a way to enrich the people and strengthen the country. The United States and Japan have already set precedents for us. Although our country is currently facing both internal and external troubles, the entire nation is vibrant, and industry and commerce are showing signs of recovery. The rural economy is improving, and the life insurance industry is also on the rise. From this, it can be seen that the nation's fortunes are improving, and the nation is awaiting rejuvenation, which is truly something to celebrate.

Since life insurance is a way to enrich the people and strengthen the country, its development in our country will one day catch up with Europe and the United States. However, the history of life insurance in our country is still shallow, and the general public is largely unaware of it. This is nothing more than a lack of educational efforts. This association and the China Insurance Society are currently working hard on this, and the major aspects of this work are listed below:

(1) Requesting the Ministry of Education to include insurance knowledge in primary school teaching materials. I, on behalf of this association, went to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Education to include insurance teaching materials in primary school and public education textbooks, following the example of Japan. The ministry agreed and promised to instruct various publishing houses to include it. I am very pleased.

(2) Requesting all university business departments to include life insurance as a required course. Life insurance is a part of economic knowledge. Business schools in universities in Europe, America, and Japan have gradually included life insurance as a required course. For example, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University have even established a major in life insurance, which shows its importance. Although business schools in our country's universities have already included life insurance in their teaching materials, it has not been designated as a required course. The association and the China Insurance Society have sent letters to various universities, requesting that life insurance be included as a required course for business students to promote it.

(3) Conducting publicity in daily newspapers. To popularize general knowledge of life insurance, this association is conducting joint publicity efforts in the Shen Bao newspaper. In addition to publishing advertisements with educational significance, a special issue is also compiled to spread information, so that the people of the country can understand life insurance and share the joy of personal and family protection.

(4) Improving the level of practitioners. Life insurance enables people to use appropriate economic means to seek protection for their personal and family well-being. Therefore, life insurance practitioners are essentially economic advisors to families, ready to provide consultation to the public. If practitioners themselves have only a superficial understanding of life insurance, how can they bear this important responsibility? Therefore, life insurance practitioners should first have sufficient training and rich knowledge to be worthy of their mission. This association and the China Insurance Society are currently planning to establish a circulating library for research by practitioners.

In short, our educational efforts do not focus on empty talk but are based on facts, so that everyone knows that life insurance is a necessary condition beyond food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and recognizes that taking out life insurance is a personal responsibility.

The field of life insurance in our country is exceptionally vast. With appropriate educational efforts, it will surely develop rapidly. Our Chinese commercial colleagues are especially loved by the people of the country, which is naturally expected. The warm welcome that various Chinese companies have received from the people of the country in the past twenty years is enough to encourage us to strive for the prosperity of our industry. I sincerely hope to cooperate with colleagues and those who study insurance to encourage each other, thoroughly implement this important mission, and live up to the expectations of the people, so that the life insurance industry can become a powerful financial institution in the country, reaching the current prosperity of the United States. Then, the protection of personal and family well-being and the progress of national construction will greatly benefit from it.

### An Analysis of the Meaning of Life Insurance

— Guo Peixian

What is life insurance?

American economist Allan H. Willet said: "Life insurance can transfer the dangers of many people to one person or a group of people. It is a social strategy of accumulating funds to prevent uncertain losses from premature death."

American insurance guru S.S. Huebner said: "From an individual's perspective, life insurance is a contract in which the insured pays premiums, and if he dies or encounters other specified events, the insurer compensates him or his beneficiary with a certain amount of insurance."

Japanese scholar Hidematsu Tsumura said: "Insurance is a group of people who worry about similar dangers, uniting to share the losses that arise among them."

Although the above definitions use different wording, their meanings are essentially the same. In short, life insurance is a scientific method of transferring an individual's life risks to a group of people, so that each person bears a small premium loss, rather than a major loss of life.

In insurance terms, anyone whose life or death is the subject of insurance is called the insured; the person who enters into the insurance contract with the insurer is called the policyholder; and the person who enjoys the benefits of the contract is called the beneficiary. Life insurance is a bilateral, compensatory contract in which the policyholder pays the insurance premium, and if the insured dies or an insured event occurs, the insurer compensates the policyholder or its designated beneficiary with the insurance amount.

Based on the above definition, we can see that the content of life insurance has the following basic meanings:

(1) Uncertainty of Risk. The word "risk" is originally an abstract noun, but in the insurance industry, it is often used to refer to the subject of insurance, such as life, houses, ships, goods, etc. The life risk insured by life insurance must be uncertain. "Uncertain" means that the occurrence of the risk cannot be predicted, and the cause of the occurrence is not automatic. For example, conspiring to harm the insured's life in order to collect the insurance money is a predetermined risk, and the insurer is not liable for compensation. Also, if the insured commits suicide intentionally, it is an automatic risk, and the insurer is generally not liable for compensation unless the insurance has been in force for more than three years.

(2) Clustering of Risks. The risks insured by life insurance must belong to the same category (Homogeneous), that is, the age and physical condition of the insured must be roughly the same, because the premium calculation is proportional to the degree of risk, and the measurement of the degree of risk is based on the age and physical condition of the insured. The degree of risk varies between older people and younger people, healthy people and weak people. It is necessary to distinguish between old and young, strong and weak, and calculate the premium to have a standard. Therefore, insurance companies either refuse to insure people who are too old, or increase the premium, or shorten the insurance period. For the insured, they must first examine their physical condition. If they are thin and weak, they are listed as a substandard risk (sub-standard), and a special premium is added before they can be insured, or it is agreed to reduce the insurance amount (Risk).

(3) Transfer of Risk. Everything in the universe, in all its variety, seems unpredictable and inscrutable when observed individually. However, if we extend the observation time and expand the scope of observation, we can often discover laws from the chaos. What life insurance insures is not the individual, but the group of individuals; not the individual's individual loss, but the overall average loss. The death of an individual is accidental, but the death of an individual in a group is not accidental. Although there are differences in the order of death, on average, the number of deaths is very fixed. However, there must be many insured people to fit the law of averages in order to predict the number of times risks occur. Statistical experts have compiled statistical tables based on experience to show how many people of the same age die on average in a year. For example, the American Experience Mortality Table, which is commonly used by general life insurance companies in our country, contains the experienced mortality rate from the age of ten to the age of ninety-five. Based on the mortality table, the insurance company can calculate in advance how much compensation it must pay each year, and at the same time calculate how much premium it should charge each person in order to compensate for the losses of the deceased. In this way, a fixed premium loss can replace an uncertain death loss.

(4) Determination of Premium. The premium collected by life insurance, except for term insurance, must be returned to the insured or the beneficiary when the insurance expires or the insured dies. Therefore, life insurance companies have accumulated funds in advance to prepare for compensation for losses. The more adequate the accumulation of reserves, the more secure the insured's protection. The accumulation of reserves must be in accordance with the provisions of the law and scientific methods. The reserve comes from the premium. The collection of the premium should not only vary according to age, but also differ according to the type of insurance policy and additional conditions. The premiums currently collected by life insurance companies are mostly evenly distributed over the insurance period, that is, from the first few years of insurance, an average premium is collected, which is more than what is needed at that time to compensate for losses and pay expenses, in order to accumulate a reserve fund to prepare for the years when deaths increase sharply and income cannot meet expenditures.

Based on the above analysis, we should recognize the true meaning of life insurance, which is not to guarantee immortality, but to guarantee the loss of productive capacity. Huebner said: "Life insurance is the only way to capitalize life value and compensate for it." In other words, life insurance can extend the productive capacity of the unfortunate, so that it still has capital value after death to maintain the lives of dependents. For families that have life insurance, although the head of the family dies, the family income remains unchanged, and family members can still live as usual, without freezing or starvation and ending up in a ditch. If there is no insurance or savings after death, once the person who earns a living dies, the family will inevitably fall into a tragic situation.

The basic meaning of life insurance lies in the dispersion of life risk burdens and the compensation for the loss of productive capacity. It can turn the uncertain dangers of life into something certain, so that we can live a stable life, feel comfortable physically and mentally, not worry about poverty in life, and not worry about support after death. It is truly the only good way to protect personal and family life. Therefore, all people with family responsibilities should take out life insurance as a guarantee for family happiness.

Protecting Individual Production and Promoting Social Tranquility

### My Opinion on Wives of Bank Employees Urging Their Husbands to Buy Life Insurance

— Tan Yunshan

Due to the influence of different environmental stages, there are differences in the thoughts and behaviors of men and women in humanity. Men mostly have more definite thoughts and behaviors only after the age of thirty. Women, however, are a bit earlier. Mostly at the age of twenty-four or above, they already have very definite thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, since ancient times, men have had a kind of "internal help" recognition of women. Assuming a very romantic man, if he gets a woman with good thoughts and behaviors to be his wife, perhaps she can correct her husband's thoughts and behaviors. This recognition has been jointly acknowledged by mankind across the entire continent for a very long time. Modern thought seems to feel a bit of a choke on the term "internal help." Especially young women often stand at the forefront of opposition. In fact, these are all small mistakes. There is no recognition of the stage of human life—the meaning of eugenics. The stage of human life is absolutely not like modern semi-artistic romanticization and suicidalization. The stage of human life is absolutely about seeking true, beautiful, and good happiness for a family. To seek true, beautiful, and good happiness for a family, there must be a strategy to guarantee the economy. There are thousands of strategies to guarantee the economy. However, "life insurance" is the first best strategy. This strategy is especially suitable and necessary for bank employees. Because,

(1) Bank employees always check more banknotes and coins than employees of other businesses due to their service. Therefore, the accumulation of unclean traces on the fingertips is also more. Banks deal with banknotes and coins worth tens of millions every day. These banknotes and coins often adhere to mold. This mold is the medium for spreading diseases. Although bank employees often wash their fingers with clean water, according to research by famous doctors at home and abroad, many molds absolutely cannot be eliminated by washing with cold water. They must be washed in boiling water for a certain period of time, or rubbed with disinfectant, to kill them. The more opportunities bank employees have to touch banknotes and coins, the more they are exposed to mold. If they are not careful and touch food with their hands, the mold will be brought into the stomach and intestines. There is a possibility of growth at any time. Assuming special precautions are taken for the fingertips to prevent mold from entering the internal organs, bank employees must check the number of banknotes and coins one by one when paying and receiving them, and observe their authenticity. Therefore, the mouth, nose, and eyes are very close to the banknotes and coins. They are often infected by banknotes and coins touched by people with infectious diseases. This is so dangerous. Bank employees absolutely cannot work all day long with masks. If they do not wrap them in masks, they often inhale mold when checking banknotes and coins, or because of breathing through the mouth and nose. Therefore, the lives of bank employees are always more terrifying and short-lived than ordinary people.

(2) Bank employees have heavier work in managing and handling incoming and outgoing accounts, money, banknotes, checks, and drafts than ordinary commercial employees. They cannot be careless at all. Otherwise, they often suffer huge losses due to temporary negligence. Therefore, the energy and effort spent are also more than ordinary store employees. Since banking affairs are extremely painstaking and require a lot of energy, bank employees are also more likely to suffer from anemia.

(3) Bank employees often indulge in pleasures and put family responsibilities behind their minds because of their relatively affluent environment. Or, they engage in speculative ventures. Once they fail, they are financially ruined and discredited, often leading to tragic suicides.

(4) Because bank employees are subject to the constraints of bank order, their common sense is often limited to the scope of the bank. Once they lose their jobs, before they have the opportunity to rejoin the bank, not only do they personally experience the taste of unemployment, but also unemployment affects the bankruptcy of the family economy.

The above are all the most important characteristics of bank employees. Bank employees should be aware of this as early as possible and move towards the lifeline of "life insurance." However, romance is the nature of men, especially general well-informed bank employees. Therefore, I very much hope that the virtuous "internal helper" of the bank employee can guide her husband to obtain the protection of "life insurance" at all times.

### News

The Shanghai Insurance Industry Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to instruct major bookstores to compile insurance teaching materials into elementary school textbooks and sent letters to universities and specialized schools to establish insurance departments in order to popularize insurance knowledge and cultivate insurance talents. The submission and special letters are recorded below.

(1) Submission to the Ministry of Education

Submitting a request to issue a notice to major bookstores to include an insurance course in elementary school textbooks so that insurance knowledge can be widely disseminated, thereby protecting people's livelihoods and maintaining thrift, and respectfully requesting review and implementation. Insurance is used to collect funds from the public to prevent unforeseen disasters for individuals. Disease and death, who can escape? Water and fire disasters, where do they not exist? If there are insurance facilities, individual personal and family property can be adequately protected, and social wealth can be increased and circulated. From this perspective, the insurance industry has infinite help in cultivating thrift, protecting people's livelihoods, developing wealth, and stabilizing society. It is understood that education authorities in Europe and the United States attach the same importance to training young people, instilling insurance knowledge, and promoting savings campaigns. The intentions involved are very clear. Recently, the Japanese Ministry of Education also included an insurance course in elementary school textbooks, also intending to popularize this excellent knowledge in the minds of young people, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort in the development of people's livelihoods and the cultivation of thrift, without falling behind European and American countries. Recently, Chairman Chiang issued the organizational outline of the New Life Movement Labor Service Corps, which specifically stipulates the fifteenth item as promoting savings and insurance campaigns, which shows the importance attached to insurance. In recent years, people's livelihoods in our country have declined, and customs have become extravagant. The education policy is to develop people's livelihoods and promote thrift as a remedy. It is found that the insurance industry is in line with this education policy, and it is appropriate to widely instill insurance ideas in young students in order to achieve practical results. Our association previously submitted a request to your department to issue a notice to major bookstores to include an insurance course in elementary school textbooks, but no instructions have been received on file. It is now learned that elementary school textbooks of various bookstores are currently being revised under orders, so Hu Yongqi is specially dispatched to submit a document to your department, humbly requesting approval as requested, and to issue a notice to major bookstores to include an insurance course in elementary school textbooks, so that insurance knowledge can be widely disseminated, thereby protecting people's livelihoods and maintaining thrift, which is convenient for the public. Respectfully submitted to Wang, Minister of Education.

Special Telecommunications Edition

### New Year's Message for the 26th Year

— Zhen

Last New Year's Day, the author wrote an article in this publication titled "New Hopes for the Telecommunications Industry," expressing boundless hopes from the perspective of the telecommunications sector for both the nation and society. Time flies, and a year has passed in an instant. In this past year, our new hopes have, in fact, been largely realized: the consolidation of world peace, the stability of the domestic political situation, the development of the national economy, the support of the political and military authorities for telecommunications, the concerted cooperation of people in society, and the organization of electrical material factories by entrepreneurs—all of these have a significant relationship with the telecommunications industry and are what we have been praying for day and night. This New Year's Day, in addition to hoping that the achievements of the past year will be maintained and promoted, we have the following goals for the nation and our industry, which will be the focus of our hopes and efforts this year:

A. Regarding the Nation

㊀ Consolidating Central Authority: Since the resolution of the Liangguang issue, the central authority has been unified, and its international standing has improved considerably. However, if there are overlapping or conflicting matters between the central government and the provinces, they should be resolved in accordance with central laws and regulations to avoid the drawbacks of redundant construction and piecemeal development. If the central authority is not consolidated, each province will act on its own, and each person will seek personal gain, leading to waste of manpower and resources in peacetime and mutual obstruction and shirking of responsibility in wartime. With inconsistent command and inflexible coordination, it will be difficult to achieve effective defense and survival. For example, all long-distance telephone services operated by provincial governments should be managed by the Ministry of Transportation this year.

㊁ Supporting the Great Achievements of Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek: The safety of the nation hinges on him, and we should undoubtedly support him. However, support should be demonstrated through action, not just empty words. Our colleagues in the telecommunications industry handle the telegrams sent by Chairman Chiang with utmost care and speed, demonstrating our support in practice. I recall last October, when celebratory telegrams poured in like snowflakes, our colleagues in various bureaus worked overtime and enthusiastically participated. Even during the Xi'an Incident, when telegrams related to rescuing Chairman Chiang were sent, all bureaus made every effort to send them despite the blocked lines, ensuring the Chairman's safe escape. Although this is our duty, we are all motivated by the leader's spirit and are willing to work hard without complaint. In the future, our colleagues should work even harder and strive for the country.

B. Regarding the Industry

㊀ Developing International Telegraphs: Since the establishment of international radio stations and the subsequent establishment of direct circuits with various countries, most of the rights and benefits of international telegraphs have been recovered. However, there are still a few people who are unaware of the excellent communication efficiency and meticulous business maintenance of international radio stations. From today onward, we hope that all people nationwide, when sending telegrams abroad, will add the phrase "Via Cgra" in the annotation column. This is a simple act for individuals but gives the nation the right to collect fees for sending telegrams. In other words, sending one more telegram "Via Cgra" adds one more point to national strength.

㊁ Promoting the Use of Telegraphs: The benefits of using telegraphs are countless, especially during the end of the year, when it is a convenient communication tool. The Ministry of Transportation has spared no effort in streamlining telegraph services in recent years to facilitate the public. The rates for domestic telegrams have been reduced several times, and since last September, telegrams within the province have been reduced by 30%, which is the biggest sacrifice in telecommunications economics. We hope that people across the country will support the spirit of improvement by the telecommunications authorities and universally use telegraphs as a communication tool, so that they will be worthy of the demeanor of modern citizens.

㊂ Completing the Long-Distance Telephone Network: The long-distance telephone service run by the Ministry of Transportation made significant progress last year. The number of locations with telephone service increased by 104 compared to 1935, the number of calls increased by 77,775 compared to 1933, the length of the lines increased by 18,013 kilometers, and the number of circuits increased by 37,531 kilometers. However, as the construction of various lines is still in progress and the amplifier stations in various locations have not yet been fully installed, nationwide communication has not yet been opened. We hope that this year, we will make the greatest determination and effort to complete the above projects in the shortest possible time, so that all parts of our country will be closely connected and responsive to each other, making a great contribution to politics, military affairs, economy, and culture.

The above is the minimum of what we hope to achieve in the new year. We do not engage in empty talk or indulge in fantasies, but only work hard under the guidance of competent officials and the supervision of the public to fulfill our responsibilities to the nation and our industry. As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves," and "Human determination can overcome nature." We offer these words as our New Year's greetings.

### Use of Telegrams During the Accounting Period

Time flies, and the commercial accounting period is fast approaching. Businesses that have transactions with counterparts in other locations or other companies will certainly send their bills to the other party in advance to facilitate contact. However, for those in distant locations, postal delivery takes a considerable amount of time, which is often too slow to be of use. During the accounting period, businesses need to settle various accounts, both those owed and those owing, and they are in dire need of funds. Therefore, they must adopt the fastest communication methods to collect accounts from related businesses in other locations. Sending telegrams is the fastest and most convenient communication method available today, and it can fully demonstrate its effectiveness, especially during the commercial accounting period. Now, let's discuss its uses as follows:

1. Telegrams for Collecting Debts: Since telegrams are the fastest communication method, all commercial telegrams sent by businesses to various locations, whether transmitted via wire or wireless telegraph, can be delivered as soon as they are sent, reaching all corners of the country. If businesses use telegrams to collect accounts from related businesses in other locations, no matter how urgent the matter may be, the message can be delivered to the other party almost instantly, making it extremely fast and convenient. For example, a telegram stating: "Yida Silk Store, Yuanwei Road, Tianjin: Your account shows a balance of (3562) yuan. Please remit immediately to Weicheng Factory." After the telegram is delivered to the recipient business by the telegraph office, if the business verifies that the account amount stated in the telegram is correct, it can remit the funds immediately. Even if the deadline is very close, regular remittances cannot arrive in time due to the time required for postal delivery. If the account is transferred by telegraph through a bank or postal savings and remittance bureau, it can arrive on the same day. It is clear that businesses using telegrams to collect accounts have an unexpected effect. The method of using telegrams to collect accounts has long been practiced by businesses in Europe and the United States and has achieved remarkable results. Major businesses in our country can emulate this method to avoid the time-consuming nature of sending bills by mail, which can be too slow to be of use.

2. Telegraphic Transfer of Accounts: After receiving an account from a business in another location, if a business remits the account through a bank and estimates that it will not arrive before the end of the accounting period, it can remit the account by telegraph through a bank or postal savings and remittance bureau for the sake of speed. No matter how far away the distance is, it can be delivered as soon as it is sent, which is extremely fast and convenient. After receiving the account, the other party business will certainly have a good impression of the business's prompt remittance by telegraph. Therefore, businesses in various locations, during this accounting period, should find telegraphic transfers both quick and convenient, and also use this to enhance commercial credit. It can be seen that the use of telegraphs in commerce is extremely broad.

3. Using Telegram Receipt Method: The telegraph receipt return method recently implemented by various telegraph offices also has considerable benefits for telegrams related to accounting. When businesses send telegrams to collect accounts, if they add the "return receipt" indicator in the telegram base, once the telegram is properly delivered by the receiving telegraph office, the telegraph office must send the "telegram receipt received" with the signature or seal of the recipient to the business that sent the telegram. After receiving the receipt, the sending business can be sure that the telegram sent by this business has been signed for by the receiving business and can estimate when the account remitted by the receiving business can be received. Also, if businesses indicate "return receipt" in the telegramic transfer of accounts, after the telegram is delivered to the recipient, the telegraph office must send the "telegram receipt received" with the signature or seal of the recipient. The business that sent the telegram can use the "telegram receipt received" with the signature or seal of the receiving business as proof of receipt of the account. If there is no formal receipt when accounting, it is also possible to attach the "telegram receipt received" to the account book. This is another use of telegrams during the accounting period.

4. Using Telegrams to Check Accounts: If an individual or business receives an account from a business in another location and, after verifying, finds that the amount listed in the account does not match the amount listed in the individual's or business's books, it is appropriate to inquire clearly in advance to settle the account. However, businesses send out bills in the days before the holiday season. Therefore, after the account is received, if there is a discrepancy in the amount of the account, those who are far away will certainly not have enough time to send a letter to inquire. If telegrams are used, no matter how short the time is, inquiries can still be made back and forth. The amount of the account can be reconciled in a short period of time, which is extremely fast and convenient.

5. Telegraphic Demand for Overdue and Mortgage Loans: During the accounting period, if businesses find that there are outstanding and overdue amounts due from businesses in other locations, they must find ways to collect them to clear the accounts. The quickest way to collect these is to use telegrams. Also, banks, money houses, etc., can use telegrams to collect overdue mortgage loans from other locations during this accounting period, and they can hopefully collect them all before the holiday season. Otherwise, the exchange of letters will take too long.

6. Telegraphic Demand for Payment of Forward Goods: If businesses have forward goods ordered by businesses in other locations that have not yet been paid for and shipped by the due date, it is also appropriate to find ways to urge the other party to pay during the accounting period to avoid delays. The most effective way to urge this is to use telegrams. If the other party business comes to pay and ship the goods immediately after receiving the telegram, then during the accounting period, this additional amount of goods and money can be used for turnover, which will also be beneficial to finance.

In summary, the use of telegrams during the commercial accounting period is very extensive and is not limited to the above points. During the commercial accounting period, if businesses can make full use of telegrams and allow them to fully demonstrate their function, they will surely benefit commerce greatly. I hope that businesses will pay attention to this.

### Two New Methods for Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service from the Ministry of Transportation

— Pu Zhan

New Contributions for the New Year

1. If a local telephone subscriber has already registered the telephone set installed with the telephone company and paid the long-distance telephone deposit (or has completed the application to connect to the long-distance telephone service), and needs to borrow another unregistered telephone set (regardless of whether it belongs to the subscriber) to transmit a long-distance telephone call, and requests that the long-distance call charges be recorded and paid on the subscriber's already registered telephone bill, the telephone company can also handle it. However, the borrowed telephone set is limited to being within the same local telephone service area as the subscriber's already registered telephone set. The registration procedures are specified as follows:

(A) If a local telephone subscriber applies to the telephone company in writing prior to using another phone to make a call: the caller should use the name of the subscriber who has registered to transmit a long-distance telephone call and provide in writing the subscriber's registered telephone number, the other telephone number that is intended to be borrowed to transmit the long-distance telephone call, and the name of the person borrowing the telephone to apply to the telephone company to have the charges for all long-distance telephone calls made by the specified caller using the other telephone included in the subscriber's registered telephone bill for payment. After obtaining written permission from the telephone company, the specified caller can borrow the other telephone set to make long-distance telephone calls according to the registration procedures for various types of calls stipulated in Article 11 of the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service Regulations. However, when registering the call, the caller should specifically state that it is a borrowed telephone call, and the charges should be recorded on the telephone bill of the subscriber's telephone number, and the caller's name, so that the telephone company can handle it accordingly.

(B) If a local telephone subscriber borrows a telephone to make a call temporarily without applying to the telephone company in writing prior to the call:

㊀ The caller should first notify the telephone location that the caller has registered with from the borrowed telephone, informing them that the caller intends to borrow a certain telephone number to transmit a long-distance telephone call to a certain place, and instruct them to wait. When the telephone company calls to inquire, they should acknowledge that they are willing to pay the call charges;

㊁ The caller should register the call with the telephone company from the borrowed telephone set according to the registration procedures for various types of calls stipulated in Article 11 of the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service Regulations, and inform them of the borrowed telephone number, requesting that the call charges be recorded on a certain telephone bill for payment, and state that the telephone location of a certain number has been notified;

㊂ After the caller registers the call, the telephone company will immediately call the telephone number designated by the caller to pay the charges and ask if they agree to have the payable call charges recorded on their bill for the long-distance telephone call that someone is currently trying to transmit to a certain location from a certain telephone set. If it is approved, the telephone company will connect the long-distance telephone call to the telephone set borrowed by the caller and record the call charges on the telephone bill designated by the caller to pay. (To be continued)

### Problem of Long-Distance Telephone Cancellation (Continued)

— Jiong

Also, if the receiving subscriber has been called by the receiving telephone company, but the receiving telephone company cannot call back the sending telephone company to transfer the call to the sending subscriber due to a sudden failure of the line or equipment, the sender can also request free cancellation.

(B) Unnecessary Repeated Calls: If a caller applies to the telephone company to register a call to a certain person in a certain location or a certain telephone number in a certain location, but the receiving subscriber happens to call first, resulting in communication first, so that it is no longer necessary to call the receiving subscriber, a free cancellation can be requested from the telephone company in accordance with regulations.

(C) Waiting Too Long: If a caller registers a call with the telephone company, but the caller has waited for two hours for an ordinary call or one hour for an urgent call due to congested lines and busy telephone traffic, and has not yet been able to connect to the other party, and requests cancellation, the telephone company can waive the cancellation fee. Also, for calls that have already been dispatched to the receiving telephone company to page the receiving subscriber, the cancellation fee is still charged in accordance with regulations. If the caller does not want to make the call for some reason and requests cancellation, the cancellation fee should still be charged, but only within the above-mentioned waiting time.

The above-mentioned situations in which calls cannot be connected are caused by equipment and line failures or congested lines and busy telephone traffic, so the caller can request free cancellation.

The cancellation fee between a certain location and a certain location is the same for all types of calls. The calculation method is based on the amount of the call charges. According to the regulations in the newly revised Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Classification Tariff Comparison Table (this comparison table and the Ministry of Transportation's Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service Regulations can be obtained from the local telephone company), the cancellation fee for ordinary called-number calls with call charges from 10 cents to 50 cents is 10 cents; the cancellation fee for call charges from 60 cents to 1 yuan is 20 cents; the cancellation fee for call charges from 1 yuan and 10 cents to 1 yuan and 50 cents is 30 cents. And so on. For example, the ordinary called-number call from Nanjing to Suzhou costs 90 cents each time, so the cancellation fee should be 20 cents. (End)

### World Peace and China

— Yu Songhua

The year 1936 has passed yesterday, and the new year of 1937 begins today. At the beginning of this new year, when we observe the world situation and China's position, we cannot but pay considerable attention to the issue of world peace, which is of concern to the whole world.

The prophecies of the war crisis of 1936 and newspapers and magazines from our eastern neighbor have been warning repeatedly since the September 18th Incident. In the past year, there was indeed the protracted Spanish war in Eastern and Western Europe, and there were also the turbulent events in Suiyuan in the East. Fortunately, a large-scale international war and massacre did not break out.

Although a large-scale international war did not take place last year, the crisis of a major war has not disappeared with the old year. Leaving aside other things, the collusion between Italy, Germany, and Japan, and the many complicated and difficult-to-resolve Sino-Japanese issues are enough to increase the world's crisis. Those countries that hold an aggressive ideology have other intentions, and there is a sense that they will not be satisfied unless the whole world is drawn into the vortex of a major war. The increase in military budgets and the active expansion of armaments in various countries are clear evidence of this. Fortunately, those who love peace in the world have been persistent in promoting peace, hoping to avert the world's catastrophe, so the unprecedented war disaster has not yet broken out in one day. Judging from the development situation, the growth and decline of aggressive forces and peaceful forces will probably be decided in this year. This is what the objective situation shows, and it is also what those who care about the world peace issue are anxious about.

In this international environment, if China wants to save itself from subjugation and strive for survival, it must strive for peaceful construction internally to enrich the country's strength, and it must be prepared to make great sacrifices externally to deal with the arrival of aggressive forces. This understanding has now become a common understanding among the Chinese people. The Liangguang Incident last year and the recent Xi'an Incident were all resolved peacefully. Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the soldiers on the front line have fought bravely and hard, and the people in various places have unanimously provided enthusiastic assistance. If there was no deep awareness and understanding of the correct steps for saving the country from subjugation and striving for survival, how could the whole country, from top to bottom, have achieved this! This is truly a major step forward for China. If we can continue to proceed in this way in the future, China's future will gradually improve. However, the international situation is unpredictable, and the pressure from foreign forces on China is increasing day by day. China's current environment is extremely difficult and dangerous. A slight carelessness can lead to the disaster of subjugation. This is also an undeniable fact. Therefore, being cautious, as if treading on thin ice, is the attitude that the Chinese people should adopt, and working hard to overcome difficult and dangerous environments is also the responsibility that the Chinese people should fulfill. Here, the reporter dares to offer three points as humble suggestions.

First, strive in one's own position. Gu Tinglin once said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Because loving and saving the country depends on everyone's efforts. At present, China's salvation from subjugation and struggle for survival also starts with everyone fulfilling their responsibilities in their respective positions, contributing their beneficial strength to society and the country. If everyone and every job can do their best in their division of labor and cooperation, and combine to form a great force, then the national crisis may not be insoluble, and China's goal of freedom and equality may gradually be achieved. This is why striving in one's own position cannot be ignored.

Second, prepare for extraordinary times. All life and all habits are very different in extraordinary times and normal times. If there is no preparation for extraordinary times in normal times, it is inevitable that there will be panic and chaos in emergencies. Whether China and the Chinese nation can turn misfortune into good fortune and turn danger into safety in extraordinary times depends on whether we have prepared for extraordinary times in normal times. Moreover, normal times and extraordinary times are not completely separate. Laxity in normal times often leads to the roots of disaster in emergencies. Only by treating normal times as extraordinary times, being vigilant at all times, and striving everywhere can we calmly deal with extraordinary times and cope with them with ease.

Third, concentrate will and strength to be united against foreign countries. In recent years, the Chinese people have a deep understanding of the importance of peaceful construction. Therefore, the greatest obstacle to China's peaceful construction in the future is not internal, but the pressure from foreign forces. If this pressure can be removed, the progress of peaceful construction will surely be rapid. This can be said with certainty. However, removing this pressure is not an easy task. It is difficult to succeed without concentrating the will and strength of the whole country on this one point. The enemy deeply fears China's unification, and often takes the strategy of division and piecemeal destruction to deal with China. The purpose is nothing more than to destroy our national united strength against foreign countries. From this, it can be seen that if we want China to be liberated from the oppression of foreign forces, concentrating will and strength and being united against foreign countries is the most effective strategy.

Saving the country should originally be done from many aspects, and the above three points are only abstract principles. However, if we do not talk about saving the country, and we sincerely want to reach the goal of saving the country through effort, then I believe that these three points are the guide for our efforts, and following this to seek the development of various concrete facts will surely lead to a bright future for the country and individuals. Saving the country is not the responsibility of unusual people, but only requires everyone to move forward towards the correct goal, pooling their wisdom and efforts, and moving forward in unison. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year is in spring; the plan for the day is in the morning." Now, at the beginning of the year, I would like to share the message of "doubling efforts according to these three points" with the Chinese people.

### China in the Past Year

— Beginning

The year of the Republic of China, year 25, has passed amidst turbulent waves. Looking back at the events that transpired during this year, one is truly dazzled. This article aims to select the most prominent events and provide an objective narrative, serving as a reference for our countrymen to look back and forward at this turn of the year.

During this past year, the most noteworthy aspect was undoubtedly the Sino-Japanese diplomacy and the situation in North China. Closely related to the evolution of the North China situation was the war in Suiyuan. To review China's past year, we must naturally focus on the developments of these two major events. However, our gaze should not be too narrow; we should also understand other significant domestic developments. Major events include political and economic reforms, developments in construction, the Liangguang Incident, and the Xi'an Incident that occurred at the end of last year. These events are inextricably linked to Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the situation in North China, and the Suiyuan War. For the sake of convenience, this article can only provide a brief overview. It is hoped that readers will grasp the changes of the past year holistically and comprehensively, discerning the rise and fall of various issues through their interconnectedness.

㊀ Sino-Japanese Diplomacy and the North China Situation

Sino-Japanese diplomacy over the past year can be roughly divided into two periods, with the return of the former Japanese Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi, to Japan and his appointment as Foreign Minister serving as the dividing line. This is not to say that Ariyoshi's appointment as Foreign Minister brought about a fundamental change in Japan's policy towards China. However, it is a clear fact that after Ariyoshi assumed the position of Foreign Minister, both China and Japan showed a tendency to strive for a comprehensive adjustment of their bilateral relations.

Japan's diplomatic policy towards China has consistently been based on the Hirota Three Principles. These principles are: ㊀ China should abandon its anti-Japanese stance and genuinely strive for East Asian peace, in which case Japan is prepared to assist China in seeking stability in East Asia; ㊁ Improve the Sino-Japanese-"Manchukuo" relationship, focusing on North China; ㊂ Prevent the spread of communism, which poses a major obstacle to East Asian peace. Hirota's speech at the opening of the Japanese Diet on January 21st of last year, the report of the outgoing Japanese Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi Akira, upon his return to Japan on February 12th, and Ariyoshi's diplomatic policies announced upon assuming his position as Ambassador to China, all consistently emphasized the implementation of the so-called Three Principles. Even after Ariyoshi's appointment as Foreign Minister, according to a report released by the China United News Agency on April 14th of last year, Ariyoshi advocated for focusing diplomatic efforts on "expanding the Hebei-Chahar political power as preparation for establishing a 'North China State'," "economically inducing China to recognize the puppet 'Manchukuo' and forming a so-called integrated Sino-Japanese-'Manchukuo' economic relationship," and "achieving the above goals under the guise of joint anti-communism." These were essentially variations of the Hirota Three Principles.

During Ariyoshi's brief tenure as Ambassador to China from late February to late March of last year, Sino-Japanese relations were significantly more active than before. In mid-March, Ariyoshi and our Foreign Minister Zhang Qun held four diplomatic talks. The content of the talks, as stated in the joint announcement issued by both sides after the four rounds of talks, was that "all issues related to the two countries were discussed." The result was that "although the views of both sides were not entirely consistent, it can be considered beneficial to the mutual understanding." From this, it can be seen that although these talks did not reach a definitive conclusion, they can be regarded as preparation for future negotiations on a comprehensive adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations.

After Ariyoshi's return to Japan, Sino-Japanese relations became quite dim due to the emergence of instability in parts of North China, and only slightly improved around July. In his diplomatic report at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, our Foreign Minister Zhang Qun sincerely proposed that China and Japan should seek a comprehensive adjustment of their relationship through diplomatic channels, marking the beginning of this effort. Subsequently, on July 17th, Japanese Foreign Minister Ariyoshi also expressed his agreement that China and Japan should make fundamental adjustments. As such, Sino-Japanese relations temporarily showed signs of revitalization. Following these expressions, in late August, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, convened a high-level meeting of officials from the foreign, army, and navy ministries in Tianjin, resulting in a concrete outcome to prepare for comprehensive negotiations between China and Japan.

Amidst the calls for a fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, incidents involving harm to Japanese residents occurred in Chengdu, Beihai, Shantou, Hankou, Shanghai, and other places, exacerbating the disputes between the two sides, leading to a tense situation. On September 13th, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe traveled from Shanghai to Beijing and began direct negotiations with our Foreign Minister Zhang Qun on all issues between China and Japan. From September 15th to 23rd, Kawagoe met with Foreign Minister Zhang three times, but due to the vast differences in their views, there were no results. Suddenly, the Shanghai Hongkou incident, in which Japanese soldiers were killed, broke out. The atmosphere on the Japanese side took an openly confrontational turn. The negotiations were thus stalled. After the three ministries discussed ways to break the deadlock, the Japanese side dispatched Kuwajima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau and the drafter of the Hirota Three Principles, carrying Japan's final proposal to China, instructing Kawagoe to negotiate. According to reports, Japan did not want to immediately resolve all pending issues, but only wanted to quickly resolve the important issues most relevant to Japan's interests. After this, the situation eased. The Sino-Japanese negotiations, which had been stalled for some time, resumed on October 19th. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh meetings between Foreign Minister Zhang and Kawagoe, the discussions focused on the special status of North China and joint anti-communism. Although there were no definitive results, there was at least the possibility of seeking a reasonable solution through normal diplomatic channels. Unfortunately, in the Suiyuan area, puppet bandits and other mixed troops, instigated by others, attacked our side. Under such circumstances, diplomatic negotiations were difficult to proceed smoothly. On December 5th, the Zhang-Kawagoe talks finally could not continue. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe left Beijing for Shanghai, leaving only the Japanese Consul-General Suma to negotiate with Gao Zongwu, the Director of the Asian Affairs Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a side channel. Eight days after the Xi'an Incident (December 20th), Kawagoe, who had been staying in Shanghai, once again traveled to Beijing, presumably with the intention of "acting according to circumstances."

As for the development of the North China situation, it can be roughly divided into three periods: the first period focused on negotiations on the Hebei-East and Chahar-North issues; the second period focused on the smuggling issue and the "joint anti-communism" issue; and the third period focused on the "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation" issue.

The North China situation was at its most critical when Yin Rugeng announced "autonomy" in November of the 24th year of the Republic of China and organized the so-called "Hebei-East 22 Counties Autonomous Committee." The establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council on December 8th provided some relief to the pressing crisis in North China. Just as the 32nd Army of our Shang Zhen was withdrawing, the Zhao Lei troops of the "Hebei-East Autonomous Committee" seized Tanggu and Dagu; at the same time, the Li Shouxin troops of the puppet "Manchukuo" army and the Mongolian security forces also occupied Guyuan, Shangdu, Kangbao, Zhangbei, Baochang, Wanquan, and other six counties in Chahar-North. As long as the puppet organization in Hebei-East existed, North China would not be at peace for a single day; as long as the six counties in Chahar-North were occupied, Suiyuan Province would be under threat for a single day. Moreover, the Japanese side's goals were definitely not limited to this. They originally intended to establish a puppet regime of the so-called "North China Five Provinces Autonomy" in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Instigating Yin Rugeng to establish the so-called puppet autonomous government of Hebei-East was the basis of this attempt. The Hebei-Chahar authorities were well aware of this crisis. Therefore, after Song Zheyuan took office as the Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, he negotiated with the Japanese side to resolve these two issues. However, due to the Japanese side's ambiguous attitude, with the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, Tada, sometimes coming forward to negotiate, and the chief of the Kwantung Army's special service agency, Doihara, being responsible for mediation at other times, one side would agree while the other would not acknowledge it, and vice versa, ultimately leading to no results.

Another serious situation in North China was the rampant smuggling. In January, February, and March of last year, the total value of smuggled goods entering the country was at least 100 million yuan. Combined with the 210 million yuan of smuggled goods from the previous year, the total value was 310 million yuan, accounting for more than 30% of our country's total import value, which is truly a staggering figure. Later, the trend of smuggling spread from North China to Central and South China, shaking the already weak foundation of China's entire national industry. In order to remedy this terrible economic hemorrhage, our government successively promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Tax Evasion and Smuggling," the "Detailed Rules for Preventing Smuggling on Railways," and the "Measures for Inspecting the Transportation and Sales of Imported Goods" in late May. However, because a certain party supported this smuggling trend in various ways, even if the government repeatedly promulgated measures to ban it, it was still impossible to implement them.

Anti-communism was one of the so-called Hirota Three Principles. Therefore, since the communist army infiltrated Shanxi, the Japanese side has made various unreasonable demands under this pretext. In fact, anti-communism is purely a matter of internal affairs of a country, and the Hebei-Chahar authorities had already taken comprehensive precautions. However, the Japanese side still insisted on raising the demand for "joint anti-communism." In May, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, Nagami, repeatedly proposed the suggestion of "joint anti-communism" to the Hebei-Chahar authorities, and believed that it was necessary to decide on specific measures immediately. The two sides negotiated on this issue for a long time, and it was rumored that an anti-communist agreement had been signed. In fact, although the Japanese side strongly urged it, they still did not get their wish.

In the third period, developing the economy of North China became the central task of the Japanese side. Sino-Japanese economic cooperation had been rumored for a long time. Initially, the Japanese side did not seem to have a concrete plan to propose. It was not until October, when the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, Tashiro, met with Song Zheyuan, that the military's pre-drafted plan was revealed. According to the scope of economic development stipulated by the military, it can be roughly divided into six sectors: first, railways; second, ports; third, electricity; fourth, Lu salt; fifth, mines; and sixth, cotton production. According to this plan, the construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang railway and the Jinan-Liaocheng railway, the dredging of rivers and seas, the opening of ports in Dagu and Qikou, the development of the North China electricity industry, cotton production improvement, the establishment of the North China Salt Industry Company, and the mining of the Longyan iron mine, etc., were all included. The Zhongxing Company, which was in charge of the economic development of North China, once considered increasing its capital from 10 million yuan to 100 million yuan. Although it did not materialize due to the wait-and-see attitude of domestic capitalists in Japan, its ambition can be clearly seen from this. By the end of last year, the first step in Sino-Japanese North China economic cooperation that had been realized was the establishment of the Huitong Company to handle Sino-Japanese navigation affairs in North China. The Huitong Company opened in Tianjin on November 17th of last year, and navigation on various lines has already begun. The construction of the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang railway and the opening of the Longyan iron mine are under consideration, and sooner or later they will probably be realized.

The banner of economic cooperation is cooperation and mutual assistance. Without mentioning anything else, just the Fengtai Incident in September of last year and the North China military exercises of the Japanese army in late October reveal the hideous face that is the opposite of cooperation and mutual assistance. The Fengtai Incident began with the Japanese army's unreasonable detention of Sun Xiangting, the company commander of our 29th Army, but ended with the coercion of our side to accept unbelievable conditions such as the withdrawal of troops from Fengtai. The Japanese army's exercises in North China lasted for ten days, from October 26th to November 5th, with more than 7,000 participants. The roar of cannons on our territory should prompt those friendly people who advocate friendship to deeply reflect!

㊁ Political, Economic, and Construction Reforms

In the past year, our country has clearly made rapid progress in politics, economy, and construction. A brief description is provided below:

(A) Promulgation of the National Assembly Organization Law, Representative Election Law, and Draft Constitution. The National Assembly was resolved to be convened on November 12th of last year by the Second Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. The National Assembly representatives were limited to those elected before Double Tenth Day (October 10th). The organization law and representative election law of the National Assembly were authorized to the Constitution Drafting Committee to formulate principles and submit draft laws to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan completed the drafting of the laws in early May, and they were promulgated by the National Government on May 15th. Since the promulgation of the election law, etc., the election of representatives has been carried out in various provinces. On October 15th, at the 23rd Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee, in view of the fact that the election could not be completed on schedule, it was resolved to postpone the National Assembly until the representatives from all regions were elected. As for the draft constitution, drafting began in January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and the draft was completed in early September. In October of the 24th year of the Republic of China, it was reviewed and completed by the Central Standing Committee. The final draft, as deliberated by the Legislative Yuan, was passed on May 1st of last year after three readings in the Yuan meeting and was promulgated by the National Government on May 5th. The full text of the constitution is divided into eight chapters, totaling one hundred and forty-eight articles.

(B) The Second Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee of the Kuomintang convened. The Second Plenary Session opened on July 10th and closed on July 14th, with one preparatory meeting and three plenary sessions in between. The presidium consisted of nine people: Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Wang Faqin, and Kong Xiangxi. Ye Chucang served as the Secretary-General of the session. Many resolutions were made at this meeting, the most important of which were two proposals concerning national defense and the resolution of the Liangguang issue. Regarding national defense, the session passed a resolution to establish a National Defense Conference, designating Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Chen Jitang as members. Regarding the resolution of the Liangguang Incident, one was to pass an order to abolish the Southwest Executive Committee, and the other was to reassign Yu Hanmou as the Pacification Director of Guangdong, and Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi as the Director and Deputy Director of the Pacification Headquarters of Guangxi, and to appoint Lin Yunhai and Huang Xuchu as the chairmen of the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments.

(C) Regarding economic matters, the two most notable events of the past year were: first, the issuance of the Unified and Reconstruction Public Bonds; and second, the passage of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. The Ministry of Finance announced the issuance of the Unified and Reconstruction Public Bonds on February 1st. The purpose of issuing the Unified Public Bonds was to exchange the old bonds issued by the government in the past. The total amount was 146 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and a repayment period divided into five types: 12 years, 15 years, 18 years, 21 years, and 24 years. Principal and interest were repaid every six months through a lottery. The funds for principal and interest repayment were still allocated from customs duties. The Reconstruction Public Bonds were used to improve the financial structure, support production and construction, and allocate funds to stabilize the bond market. The total amount was 34 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and repayment within 24 years. The methods and fund allocation for principal and interest repayment were the same as those for the Unified Public Bonds. The drafting of the income tax bill began in June of last year and was passed by the Legislative Yuan on July 9th at its 68th Yuan meeting, called the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, with a total of six chapters and twenty-two articles. According to these regulations, the scope of taxation included income from capital profits and temporary profits, income from salaries, and income from interest on securities and deposits. The tax rate ranged from 5 per thousand to 200 per thousand.

(D) In the past year, the most significant progress in construction was the development of transportation. Highways in various provinces were being built rapidly. Taking the liaison highways in various provinces supervised by the National Economic Council as an example, according to the figures released in November of last year, the total length of trunk and branch lines was 29,876 kilometers, of which 22,923 kilometers were open to traffic by the end of September. Regarding railway construction, the most important event last year was the opening of the Yuehan Railway on September 1st. This railway starts from Wuchang in Hubei Province in the north, passes through Hunan, and reaches Guangzhou. The total length of the line is 1,960 kilometers. Connecting to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway in the south and the Pinghan Railway in the north, the Yuehan Railway is the largest railway running through China. In addition, the construction plans for the Xiangqian Railway (from Changsha in Hunan to Guiyang in Guizhou) and the Chengyu Railway (from Chengdu to Chongqing) have also been concretized.

㊂ The Liangguang Incident

At this critical time of national crisis, we should concentrate internal forces to resist the enemy together, and should never waste national strength due to internal problems. This is the creed that the people of the country should abide by together. The peaceful resolution of the Liangguang Incident last year, without either side resorting to military force,

### China's Foreign Trade and Industry in the Past Year

— Sun Huairen

Observing China's economy in 1936 (the 25th year of the Republic) solely from the surface, one could naturally say it was "slightly better than expected" compared to 1935. In foreign trade, there was a month with a trade surplus; in agriculture, there was a major harvest; in prices, there was a tendency towards rising; and in foreign exchange, there was a relatively stable situation. Of course, we do not deny that these phenomena are optimistic signs. However, to conclude that China's economy had already recovered to prosperity based solely on these materials would be somewhat "illogical." At best, we can only say that the panic in China's economy in 1936 did not drastically worsen. However, many economic crises still lingered, not yet extinguished. This is because China is not an isolated island in the world economy. Especially for a country like China, which is in a "semi-colonial" position, it is impossible in reality to break free from the constraints of the great powers and independently escape the global panic to achieve prosperity. Moreover, China's economy itself, since the outbreak of the great panic in 1931 (the 20th year of the Republic), has been exhausted for six years. It is also impossible in reality to completely restore it with a slight improvement. Therefore, the greatest effect of some changes in China's economy in 1936 was only to strengthen the resistance to the panic, but not to fundamentally eliminate the panic.

The slight improvement in the economic situation in the past year cannot be denied as being stimulated by the currency reform in November 1935. At the time of the currency reform, we pointed out its characteristics, believing that it might be possible to use it to temporarily stimulate the numb Chinese economy. However, to use it to drive away the panic in the Chinese economy, the currency system itself simply does not have this capability. This is just like a person with numerous ailments; even if one part of the disease is cured, it is impossible to fully restore health. Therefore, the failure of currency reform to restore prosperity is by no means the fault of the currency system itself. In fact, the relatively satisfactory performance of China's economy last year can be said to be the maximum effect that currency reform has had. We cannot expect any more than that. Now, let's take a look at the situation of foreign trade and industry in 1936 to confirm that this theory is not wrong.

From January to September of last year, total imports were 680 million yuan, a decrease of 40 million yuan compared to the same period last year; exports were 510 million yuan, an increase of over 110 million yuan. As a result, the import surplus decreased by 147 million yuan, and January was even a month with a trade surplus. This phenomenon is, of course, a favorable development for China's international lending. And this favorable development is, of course, partly due to currency reform. But apart from this, there are two other reasons that cannot be ignored in terms of imports. The first is the sudden decrease in the import of foreign grain (rice has dropped from the first position in imports to the eighth, and wheat has dropped from the sixth to the thirteenth). The reason for this reduction in foreign grain is because of the poor overseas production last year and China's imposition of rice import tariffs. The second is due to rampant smuggling, with many imports not recorded in customs registers. If these two reasons did not exist, then the value of imports last year might not have decreased so much. As for the increase in exports, the factor of the global demand for military supplies cannot be ignored. We know that the top ten export goods last year were tung oil, raw hides and leather goods, egg products, raw silk, tea, bristles, drawn work, tin ingots, cotton, and sesame. Among these ten, products with less military significance, such as egg products, raw silk, and tea, did not actually increase much in exports, and their positions have even declined compared to last year. Therefore, the improvement in China's international trade last year may initially be attributed to the stimulation of the new currency system, but without the assistance of other factors, the import surplus might not have been reduced so much. The reduction of the apparent import surplus due to smuggling cannot be said to be beneficial to China. However, the real decrease in import value and the real increase in export value are undeniably good phenomena. However, in China's trade last year, although the authorities promulgated many regulations to prevent smuggling, the trend of smuggling has not been curbed. Recently, in North China, automobiles are openly used for transportation, and the inspection offices have no solution. As for the real decrease in imports and the real increase in exports, signs of unsustainability have emerged after the third quarter. The following table shows the monthly average of imports and exports: (unit: million yuan)

This figure tells us several facts: ㊀ The monthly average of imports increased faster than the monthly average of exports; ㊁ The monthly average of imports in the third quarter was already larger than the same period last year; ㊂ The monthly average of exports in the third quarter was already less than the same period last year. This fact indicates that although China's trade last year was generally improved, the tendency for improvement was difficult to sustain by the third quarter, and even returned to the same level as the same period last year. Although this half-year improvement in trade is temporary for China's extremely adverse trade situation in recent years, it is ultimately very valuable. However, it is inevitable to encounter the "sorrow of disillusionment" if we are optimistic about the future of trade because of this.

Next, let's look back at the situation of domestic industry and commerce. The prosperity or decline of industry and commerce can be observed from the changes in commodity market prices on the one hand, and from the changes in industrial and commercial organizations on the other. Here, let's first list some important market prices: (unit: yuan, according to the Bank of China Monthly)

Looking at these commodity market prices, we can undoubtedly see that last year's market prices were much more active than the previous year (except for rice and raw silk). The rise in commodity market prices is naturally a sign of prosperity for producers and for the Chinese economy. However, if we observe more deeply, we find that last year's rise in market prices contained some defects. The first point we can point out is that the price increase was not sustained. Among the commodities mentioned above, except for cotton yarn, rice, wheat, and flour, the prices of various commodities have shown a tendency to decline successively. Originally, last year, after the currency value decreased, even if the prices were intentionally prevented from rising, they would not have fallen month by month. Therefore, the lack of sustainability in this price increase is probably due to the lack of real demand. The second point we can point out is the disharmony in the price increases of agricultural products and industrial products. Among the ten commodities mentioned above, the ones whose prices increased less than the previous year or even fell were raw silk, cotton, green tea, black tea, and rice. The degree of increase in the other five was much greater than the former five. And these commodities that increased rapidly, except for wheat, are all industrial products. This situation cannot be said to be a healthy phenomenon in the Chinese economy, because the gap between the prices of agricultural products and industrial products relatively shrinks the purchasing power and market in China, where the agricultural population accounts for the majority. Among the above two defects, the latter is naturally more serious. Last year, it happened to coincide with an unprecedented bumper harvest. At the same time, disasters were not very common, so this defect has not caused any significant adverse consequences. If this year's natural environment cannot be as good as last year, and there cannot be a more expanded issue of currency, then it will be quite difficult to keep prices stable without falling.

Regarding the changes in industrial and commercial organizations, although there are no nationwide systematic materials yet, only taking Shanghai as an example, then it can only be said that the situation is slightly better than the previous year, but it cannot be said to have reached prosperity. According to a survey by the China Credit Information Service, the changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce in the third quarter of last year are as follows:

Judging from this statistical figure, the number of new industrial and commercial establishments in the third quarter of last year has been increasing month by month, and conversely, the number of closures has been gradually decreasing. This seems to symbolize that industry and commerce have been trending towards prosperity last year, but in fact, if we examine its content, we can find many facts that are not entirely true.

From this analysis of the content, we can obtain several accurate concepts: The first point that should be noted is that the most new establishments this year are special industries. In the first quarter, health and entertainment industries were the most prominent; in the second quarter, hotels and restaurants were the most prominent; and by the last month of the third quarter, it had changed to "escort agencies," a disguised form of prostitution. As for important special industries such as the financial industry and the construction industry, there has been almost no development; The second point to note is that there has been no significant development in the manufacturing industry. In the first quarter, six new establishments were created, but forty closed down. In the second quarter, twelve new establishments were created, but thirty-six closed down. In September of the third quarter, seven new establishments were created, but ten closed down; The third point to note is that the trend of reorganization, contraction, and closure in sales businesses is particularly large, and has far exceeded new developments; The fourth point to note is that the data collected in this statistic do not distinguish between large and small, and it is somewhat dangerous to judge solely based on the number of establishments rather than the scale. Combining these points, we can boldly conclude that the development of industry and commerce last year has not yet had genuine soundness. Moreover, generally speaking, if we regard new establishments and expansions as good phenomena, and contractions, reorganizations, and closures as bad phenomena, then the ratio of the former to the latter last year is approximately one to six.

From the inferences based on the foreign trade and Shanghai industry and commerce situations above (in fact, other situations are also largely the same), it is very sufficient to prove what we said earlier, that is, China's economy last year can generally be said to be slightly "better than expected." But this "better than expected" can, at most, only strengthen China's resistance to the panic, and it is fundamentally not yet talking about prosperity. And to truly make China prosperous, I am afraid it will take several economic reforms beyond currency reform.

Meeting each other amidst conflicts is indeed a matter worth celebrating.

The sharp confrontation between Guangdong-Guangxi and the central government arose from differing opinions on resisting the enemy. The Guangdong-Guangxi side advocated immediate resistance and repeatedly sent telegrams in early June requesting the central government to lead troops. After this banner was raised, Guangdong-Guangxi mobilized troops to move north. The Cantonese army advanced north along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and the Guangxi army advanced north from Lingling, reaching the south of Hengyang in Hunan Province. At the same time, the central government also mobilized heavy troops in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces for defense, creating a situation that seemed ready to erupt. Fortunately, the central government consistently adopted a political approach to resolve the situation, and the southwestern authorities were also unwilling to sacrifice their strength in internal conflicts, so a civil war was avoided. This incident took a major turn after Li Han-hun, deputy commander of the 2nd Army under Chen Jitang, and Yu Hanmou, commander of the 1st Army, telegraphed their support for the central government. On July 13, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to remove Chen Jitang from all his posts, with Yu Hanmou succeeding him as Pacification Commissioner. After Chen was forced to leave Guangdong, the Guangdong part was declared resolved. The Guangxi part of the problem could have been resolved at the same time, but the central government's announcement of the replacement of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi as the Guangxi Pacification Commissioners with appointments as Standing Committee members of the Military Affairs Commission and Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government caused complications. On July 28, Li and Bai convened a military conference in Nanning, and their attitude suddenly became tough. In early August, there were even rumors of organizing an independent government. After a prolonged stalemate, Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, Cheng Qian, Chief of Staff, and Zhu Peide, Director of the Office of the Military Affairs Commission, were appointed as mediators and flew to Nanning on September 2 to discuss a peaceful resolution with Li and Bai. After several consultations, the extremely depressed situation was finally broken on September 6, and the decided solution was to retain Li Zongren as the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner, while Bai Chongxi was transferred to the Military Affairs Commission as a Standing Committee member. A great disturbance was peacefully resolved, truly a great fortune amidst misfortune.

㊃ The Suiyuan War

We only need to briefly look at the circumstances surrounding the Suiyuan War to understand that this Suiyuan War was not a local affair, nor was it an accidental occurrence. It was merely part of a certain party's plan to annex North China and an inevitable stage in its development.

The bandit-puppet forces' invasion of Suiyuan had already been tested on a small scale in July and August of last year. Although they were repelled at that time, because the ambition of the commander behind them had not been extinguished, the tense situation did not lessen. Sure enough, there were constant harassing actions in early November, and on the 11th, mixed troops of bandit-puppets from Shangdu, under the command of Li Shou-hsin, attacked the Taolin area in eastern Suiyuan. The bandit-puppet forces' invasion plan was roughly divided into two routes: northern Suiyuan and eastern Suiyuan. The northern Suiyuan route used Bailingmiao as a base, either heading down to Wuchuan and taking Guisui, or heading down to Guyang and occupying Baotou; the eastern Suiyuan route wanted to take Jining directly from Shangdu, cutting off the connection between Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Hebei provinces. From the end of November to the beginning of December, the bandit-puppets attacked according to this plan. In the process of the war, the equipment and commanders of the bandit-puppet forces were supplied by a certain party, and the Kwantung Army Headquarters even had plans to send regular troops to assist. The planners of the certain party originally expected to take Guisui and Baotou in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, on the evening of November 23, our army fought bravely and occupied Bailingmiao on the morning of the 24th. On December 10, it recovered Damiao, which is 160 li west of Bailingmiao. This was a major turning point in the Suiyuan War. First, these two victories proved the fallacy of the defeatist mentality of some people; second, Bailingmiao and Damiao were important military bases for the bandit-puppet forces in northern Suiyuan. After being captured, the crisis of coercion by the bandit-puppet forces in northern Suiyuan was eliminated. At first, the Suiyuan War had more of a defensive meaning on our side, but after the recovery of Bailingmiao and Damiao, the situation changed. If we were to launch an active war of resistance, this should be regarded as a very favorable starting point.

Since the Suiyuan War broke out, we have seen an extremely gratifying phenomenon, that is, the nationwide enthusiasm for supporting Suiyuan. Those with financial resources enthusiastically donated, which was expected. Those without financial resources even went on hunger strikes to donate money to the soldiers at the front. Such a soaring national consciousness and national sentiment are signs of the success of the Chinese nation's liberation movement!

㊄ The Xi'an Incident

By December of last year, everyone saw that there were no major waves in either domestic or foreign affairs, and thought that they could pass the rest of the year peacefully. Who would have thought that the Xi'an Incident would be the concluding article of this year's short history?

It is said that the incident had been brewing for a long time. A year ago, the so-called young Northeastern faction in Zhang Xueliang's staff, such as Miao Jinran and Ying De-yi, had gradually gained power. Many young officers under Zhang's subordinates Wang Yizhe and He Zhuguo followed them. They had planned to launch the incident two months ago, and the telegram had already been drafted, but it was stopped by Mo Dehui's strong persuasion. By the end of November, the internal situation became more urgent. Zhang Xueliang flew to Luoyang on December 3 to meet with Chairman Chiang. Chiang thought that after a clear explanation, he would be relieved, and decided to personally give a speech to the troops stationed in Xi'an on the morning of the 12th. Unexpectedly, he was taken advantage of. On the morning of the 12th, Zhang's subordinates rebelled and kidnapped Chiang. At the same time, the central military and political officials who were detained included Chiang Ting-wen, Zhu Shaoliang, Chen Cheng, Chen Jicheng, Wei Lihuang, Wan Yaohuang, Chen Diaoyuan, Ma Zhanshan, Zeng Kuangqing, Shao Lizi, Qian Dajun, Zhang Chong, and Jiang Fangzhen, a total of 13 people. Those who died in the line of duty were Shao Yuanchong, Chiang Xiaoxian, Xiao Naihua, and Yang Zhenya.

From the occurrence of the incident to the time the reporter finished writing this article, the resolution of this incident has undergone several twists and turns. On the 12th, the National Government ordered Zhang Xueliang to be dismissed and severely punished, which shows the government's basic view on handling this incident. On the 14th, Australian Donald, who had served as Zhang Xueliang's advisor, flew to Xi'an to meet with Zhang Xueliang to give Zhang Xueliang and others a chance to repent and turn around. This was the first turning point. After Donald returned, there did not seem to be much progress or turning point, so on the 16th, the National Government issued an order to suppress the rebellion, appointing He Yingqin as the commander-in-chief of the suppression. On the 17th, Liu Zhi was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route Army of the suppression, and Gu Zhutong was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Western Route Army of the suppression. This was the second turning point. On the 17th, Chiang Dingwen, who had originally been kidnapped together, flew from Xi'an to Nanjing, carrying Chairman Chiang's handwritten letter, instructing Commander-in-Chief He to temporarily stop bombing. This was the third turning point. On the 20th, Soong Tzu-wen flew to Xi'an to meet with Chairman Chiang and Zhang Xueliang. On the 21st, he returned to Nanjing. On the 22nd, he flew to Xi'an again with Madam Chiang. On the afternoon of the 25th, Chairman Chiang escaped danger and flew from Xi'an to Luoyang. A great disturbance was peacefully resolved, which is worth celebrating.

### The International Situation of the Past Year

— Ji Nan

In recent years, commentators have generally regarded 1936 as the year of the most serious international crisis and the possible outbreak of World War II, fearing that the world's tragic changes may not be avoided and that the catastrophe of mankind will be seen again. However, in fact, 1936 has passed in anxiety and shock. During the year, the international situation changed in many ways, with the two major forces of peace and aggression rising and falling. Although some parts of the world are inevitably disturbed, on the whole, the so-called outbreak of World War II has not yet been seen in fact. If we try to analyze the internal nature of the important international developments of the past year and observe their interrelationships, there should be traces to be found.

In late February, the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact signed in May of last year was passed by the French Chamber of Deputies and formally ratified. The pact stipulates: "If France and Russia are attacked without provocation, the two countries agree to immediately assist each other;" "If non-League of Nations member states engage in aggression and target France and Russia as their targets of aggression, France and Russia also agree to immediately assist each other." Its significance is actually aimed at Germany. Soon after, on March 7, Hitler unilaterally declared the abolition of the Locarno Treaty and the stationing of troops in the Rhineland. The system of collective security in Western Europe for more than ten years was completely destroyed, shocking the world, and the situation suddenly became tense. The excuse for abolishing the treaty was that the Franco-Soviet pact violated the spirit of Locarno and posed a major threat to Germany. In fact, Hitler's attempt to get rid of the constraints of post-war treaties has always been his consistent policy. Since the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War, Germany has been watching the situation, seizing opportunities to restore its pre-war status. With Britain and Italy at odds over sanctions, the Stresa Front was on the verge of collapse, and joint resistance to Germany was impossible. At the same time, the League of Nations was overwhelmed by the failure of sanctions against Italy and had no energy to punish Germany's breach of treaties, so there was no need to worry too much about the danger of being sanctioned by the League of Nations. This is why Hitler dared to take such extraordinary measures, defying the world. We can see that after the German troops entered the Rhineland, although France's attitude was extremely firm, advocating strict sanctions, demanding military assistance from the Locarno signatories, applying to the League of Nations to take severe measures, and convening representatives of the signatory countries to form a four-nation agreement, with the determination not to negotiate without withdrawing troops, it ultimately gave in to Britain's ambiguous attitude and the gradually approaching of Germany and Italy, daring not to rashly start a war, and watching the treaty guaranteeing the security of the French and Belgian borders being torn up by Hitler without being able to do anything. It can be seen that the contradictions among the Western European countries are deep, and it is not easy to coordinate to jointly contain the expansion of aggressive forces and maintain the survival of collective security.

Regarding the Italian-Abyssinian War, since its outbreak in May of last year, due to the deep conflict of interests between Britain and Italy, knowledgeable people have long regarded it as an important factor in the outbreak of a major war. Britain believed that Italy's expansion of power in East Africa could directly shake its hegemony in the Mediterranean and indirectly affect the survival of the British Empire, so it consistently put pressure on Italy and spared no effort to support the implementation of League of Nations sanctions against Italy. However, in order to take care of the anti-German front, France did not want to seriously hurt Italy's feelings, and although it supported sanctions, it failed to take the same steps as Britain. Therefore, the League of Nations' sanctions measures could not be thorough, progress was difficult, and there was little practical effect. After the failure of the Hoare-Laval Pact in December of last year, the hope of compromise was dashed, and Britain further tightened sanctions, proposing an oil embargo. However, France was deeply afraid of expanding the scope of the war and always held back, resulting in hesitation and missed opportunities. After Hitler took the opportunity to unilaterally declare the abolition of the Locarno Treaty and the stationing of troops in the Rhineland, the European countries had to shift their attention to the tense situation on the banks of the Rhine River. France, facing this extraordinary change, was panicking and at a loss in dealing with the difficulties, and had no energy to spare to take care of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, which was not directly related. Therefore, Mussolini was able to calmly use force in East Africa, capturing Addis Ababa in early May and adding the title of Emperor of Abyssinia to the Italian King. From then on, the Mediterranean was shared by Britain and Italy. Britain, due to the threat of Italy's powerful air force to its naval base on the island of Malta, lost its value in controlling the Mediterranean, and its sea routes were likely to be cut off by Italy at any time. Its centuries-old hegemony in the Mediterranean had also begun to shake. However, although Britain felt deeply hurt, it was limited by reality, and the situation did not allow for war. It had to compromise, reluctantly concede, and lift sanctions in order to ease the situation for the time being. However, the competition between the two countries in the Mediterranean, both overt and covert, is in full swing, and we cannot conclude that the dispute has been reasonably resolved based on temporary easing. Recently, Rome has also strongly advocated the idea of an Anglo-Italian gentleman's agreement, arguing that the two countries should establish a sincere, rapid, and thorough understanding based on the recognition of mutual interests in order to break the deadlock. However, since Italy regards the Mediterranean as equal to life, and Britain regards the freedom of traffic in the Mediterranean as the key to the survival of the empire, the two sides may temporarily compromise, but whether the crisis of conflict can really be eliminated seems to depend on the evolution of the situation.

In mid-July, a right-wing armed rebellion occurred in Spain, attempting to overthrow the government and establish a dictatorship. The world paid attention to it as another major change in Europe after the end of the Italian-Abyssinian War. The rebels had actually reached a tacit understanding with Germany and Italy in advance, while the government forces had the sympathy of France and Russia. The seriousness of its significance is not only the conflict between the left and right factions in Spain. Britain and France, deeply fearing that this would trigger a major war crisis, advocated a non-intervention agreement with Spain, urging Germany, Italy, Portugal, Russia, and other countries to join in succession to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. However, in fact, the assistance of Germany, Italy, and Portugal to the rebels has never stopped, allowing the rebels to win victories and capture famous cities one after another. By mid-October, the capital city of Madrid was besieged, and the war reached its most serious stage. Then, the Soviet Union, believing that the violation of the agreement by Germany, Italy, and Portugal had forced it to no longer be able to ignore it, announced to the Adjustment Committee of the Non-Intervention Agreement that it would reserve freedom of action. Therefore, for the past two months, the artillery fire in Madrid has been no less than a decisive battle between the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy. If the Adjustment Committee cannot quickly take effective measures, then in case of careless action, it will further develop into an open conflict, which will inevitably lead to a situation that European politicians are unwilling to deal with, and the consequences, how can it be imagined? Recently, Britain and France have also made a mediation proposal, advocating a truce between the two sides, and a referendum by citizens to determine the suitability of the political system. If this move can proceed smoothly, it can temporarily ease the crisis. However, it is difficult to predict whether Germany, Italy, and Portugal will not go too far. Judging from the current situation, the three countries do not seem to have the sincerity to accept the proposal, and the hope of compromise is extremely bleak. The future of the Spanish turmoil is really worrying.

Austria is located between Germany and Italy. Germany has long wanted to annex it to realize its Third Reich, but it has been restricted by the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Saint-Germain, as well as the intervention of the Little Entente and Britain and France. In particular, Italy has the most intense conflict with Germany due to the security of the Brenner Pass and the development of economic plans in the Danube River basin, and it strongly opposes it. It is recalled that in July 1934, when the Austrian Social Democratic Party, instigated by Hitler, launched a riot to seize power and Dollfuss was tragically killed, Italy immediately deployed troops to the border, determined to intervene by force. The situation was tense and peaceful in Central Europe was in danger. Commentators say that Austria is the powder keg of Central Europe, which is not an exaggeration. In the past three years, the Austrian issue has been the focus of contention between Germany and Italy. As long as the issue exists, the diplomatic relations between the two countries will not be easy to compromise. However, how long has it been? The shift in the international situation has made the use of diplomatic means unpredictable. Hitler took advantage of the League of Nations being busy dealing with the East African dispute and having no time to take care of other matters, and suddenly stationed troops in the Rhineland, and Italy's oil embargo was thus resolved. This kind of mutual use of facts opened the door to German-Italian cooperation. The two countries knew that it was urgent to remove the obstacles to compromise and quickly reach an understanding to resist the pressure of Britain and France. Therefore, Germany and Austria actually concluded an agreement on July 10 under the mediation of Mussolini. The Central European dispute came to an end. From then on, the two major Fascist forces of Germany and Italy began to join hands, the Stresa Front no longer existed, and Germany was able to emerge from the encirclement led by France, devoting all its efforts to developing towards Eastern Europe, forming a large group of countries such as Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Austria, confronting France and Russia. Europe was clearly divided into two major camps, evenly matched and preparing for war with each other. The confrontational situation before the war has reappeared.

As mentioned above, the two major groups in Europe, on the one hand, are mainly composed of France and Russia, supported by the Little Entente; on the other hand, they are centered on Germany and Italy, and are allied with countries such as Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania. Britain is outside the group, still hoping to avoid the formation of a confrontational situation, and is indecisive. Other small countries, feeling the increasing urgency of the crisis, are all wandering in distress and have nowhere to turn for the sake of their own security. However, in recent months, the two major groups have been trying to win over countries to gain weight, and diplomats have been extremely active, traveling around and using all their scheming abilities. For example, France and Poland suddenly established a financial and military agreement in early September, restoring old ties, making the cooperation between Germany and Poland since 1934 a bubble. Poland's independence is due to the guarantee of the Treaty of Versailles. For the past two years, Hitler's arbitrary tearing up of the treaty has been regarded as waste paper, which has really made Poland feel cold. Moreover, the issue of Danzig and the Polish Corridor has always been the crux of the conflict between Germany and Poland. Poland cannot but urgently seek its own safety, change its plans, return to the French group, and restore the military alliance of 1920. Its significance is that France's diplomatic circle has been reconnected, and France, Russia, Poland, and the Little Entente stand on the same front. In the future, Germany will never be able to fly over Polish territory to attack Ukraine, and France, Russia, and the Little Entente will also assist Poland in resisting German invasion, and Germany's eastward plan will have one more obstacle. Another example is Hitler's third violation of the treaty in November, declaring the abolition of international navigation clauses, although it was intended to exchange various interests with the countries concerned, the greatest goal was to coerce Czechoslovakia to turn to it. Czechoslovakia is a newly emerging country after the war, relying on the treaty to maintain its survival, and has always had close relations with France. Germany and Italy have been deliberately trying to win over the Little Entente to weaken the power of France and Russia. Romania and Bulgaria may be easier to approach, but Czechoslovakia believes that if the Third Reich is once realized, it is tantamount to declaring its death sentence, so it must still adhere to the alliance between France and the Little Entente and the Soviet-Czech pact. Therefore, Germany abolished the navigation clauses, making Czechoslovakia no longer able to use the international waterways of the Elbe River and the Danube River, and no longer able to reach the free ports of Hamburg and Stettin in Germany, cutting off its access and threatening it. The seriousness of its significance is not only a major blow to Czechoslovakia, but also an indirect demonstration to France. Furthermore, in October, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano visited Berlin, held German-Italian talks, decided to improve Anglo-Italian relations, and proposed the conclusion of a Mediterranean

Gentleman's Agreement in order to win over Britain; In late November, the German-Japanese Agreement and the Italian-Japanese Agreement were successively announced, calling for an anti-Soviet front, corresponding to the East and the West; These are all manifestations of the Italian-German group's attempt to expand its influence. As for Belgium's announcement in October to restore its pre-war neutrality policy, although it is unfavorable to Britain and France, the degree of unfavorableness is not as great as it seems on the surface. Belgium has witnessed the League of Nations' authority gradually decline, the Locarno Treaty has been abolished, and the steps of Britain and France are inconsistent. The future Locarno Conference still has many difficulties, and the guarantee of its national border security has been almost lost. Therefore, it cannot but urgently rise up to seek its own safety, strengthen its national defense, and avoid participating in wars that are unrelated to its own country. However, the geographical situation is ultimately unchangeable. Whether Belgium can avoid repeating the mistakes of 1914 in the future war is uncertain. If Germany once again destroys Belgium's neutrality, Belgium will resist desperately, and Britain and France will not be able to sit idly by. As a result, Belgium will still rejoin the British and French sides. Belgium's statement that it does not intend to disregard various international obligations and continues to respect the Franco-Belgian military agreement is for this reason.

Regarding the Far East, since Japan exclusively occupied the Eastern Provinces after the September 18th Incident, the Naval Treaty, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Four-Power Treaty produced by the Washington Conference have been completely destroyed, the balance of power in the Pacific has been declared broken, the conflict between Japan, the United States, and Britain has gradually become acute, the opposition between Japan and Russia has become more and more intense, and the trend of understanding between Britain, the United States, and Russia has gradually formed. After Japan withdrew from the London Naval Conference in January and refused to participate in the 1936 New Naval Treaty, the Pacific situation turned to an even more dangerous stage. The countries concerned are competing to build ships and planning to defend the Pacific islands, all trying to protect their power with a large navy and a large air force policy. In order to protect its national border security, Russia has no choice but to actively deploy defenses and prepare to resist. The double-track railway of Ussuri in its Maritime Province and the double-track of the Siberian Railway from Lake Baikal to Boli have been completed. Forty-nine fortresses along the Heilongjiang River to the Ussuri River and the seven thousand miles of railway from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean are being rushed to build. The relationship between Japan and Russia is becoming more and more tense.

In summary, the entire world has been divided into two major camps. The post-war international equilibrium has changed into the confrontation of groups. The German-Italian group has great ambitions and intends to change borders; the French-Russian group strives to guarantee security and maintain the status quo. Once preparations are complete and strength is sufficient, the aggressive group will inevitably find an excuse to start a war, and the peaceful group will no longer tolerate it. With the many reefs in Europe and the complexity of the Far Eastern relations, a major conflict can be triggered almost anytime and anywhere. The outbreak of the Second World War is only a matter of time. Britain hovers between the two major groups, with a pivotal force. On the one hand, it wants to maintain the status quo, and on the other hand, it is deeply afraid of the rise of left-leaning forces. Its actions have the most noteworthy impact on the overall situation. According to its traditional conservative policy, it has always advocated preserving practical interests. At present, it seems that it still intends to reach an understanding with Japan in the Far East in order to preserve economic power, and to compromise with Germany and Italy in Europe in order to maintain its position in the Mediterranean, attempting to convene a new Locarno Conference to avoid war. Whether a major war can be avoided will be judged by whether the steps of Britain and France are consistent in the future Locarno Conference, and whether Britain and the United States can truly cooperate on the Pacific. The time is pressing, and a slight delay will cause irreparable regret. The cruelty of the last war is still in front of us. It is hoped that the politicians of all countries will learn from the past and expand their vision, and urgently seek effective ways to stop the war.

### A Review of Industrial Construction Over the Past Year

— Wu Dingchang

Since President Chiang took over as head of the Executive Yuan, he has focused on industrial construction. Premier Sun Yat-sen said, "The priority of construction is people's livelihood." President Chiang also stated, "The current national crisis in China is multifaceted, but the most serious is economic exhaustion—a crisis of total national collapse." Today's industrial construction is truly urgent. I have been in charge of industrial administration for a year, and I have also been assisting the National Economic Council for several months. I uphold Premier Sun's teachings and President Chiang's instructions, and witnessing the current suffering of the people and the economic difficulties, I am even more motivated and dare not slack off. However, industrial construction is complex and multifaceted, and the success of a project often requires years. It is not easy to achieve much in a short year. As the new year approaches, I would like to offer a simple review of the measures taken in the past year, which I believe readers will appreciate.

The industrial construction of the past year, to speak of the most significant, can be summarized in several points:

1.  Agricultural Construction: Agricultural construction has many complexities. The recent rural bankruptcy has made the situation feel like everything needs to be rebuilt. In addition to striving to improve administrative efficiency, improving agricultural technology and adjusting rural finance are considered the most urgent tasks. It is essential to lay the foundation as soon as possible.

(1) Technical aspects are the responsibility of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute. Although it is not easy to have significant records of technical improvements, the promotion of improved rice varieties, for example, has reached 31,038 mu in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hunan provinces, and more than 14,000 dan of improved seeds have been selected, ready for expanded promotion next year. It can reach more than 200,000 mu. Demonstration farms for improved varieties have also reached 23 counties in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hunan provinces. Cotton seed trials have been particularly successful. Si Zi No. 4 cotton seed has been popularized in North China, and De Zi No. 531 cotton seed has been extensively promoted in the Yangtze River basin. This year's bumper cotton harvest is significantly related to this. Next year, we will further promote it on a larger scale. Other crops such as wheat and various grains are also undergoing improvement trials. (2) In terms of agricultural finance, the establishment of the Farmers Bank of China has laid a solid foundation for agricultural finance. The bank's fixed capital and cooperative lending capital total 60 million yuan, with the government and banks each contributing half, to be fully paid up in five years. Depending on objective needs, the bank and the banking sector will also agree on the amount of circulating capital at any time. The regulations for cooperative banks have been promulgated, temporarily setting the capital of the central cooperative bank at a minimum of 10 million yuan, the capital of the provincial cooperative bank at a minimum of 1 million yuan, and the capital of the county cooperative bank at a minimum of 100,000 yuan. The national warehouse network has also been planned and is awaiting completion, divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D, to coordinate the national marketing of agricultural products. The total capacity is estimated at 200 million shi dan, requiring a total expenditure of 17,621,344 yuan. All are being carried out separately by the Farmers Bank of China. (3) For cooperative enterprises, administrative guidance has been completely unified, deciding to prioritize quality over quantity, in order to develop cooperatives in a standardized manner. We are also starting to fundamentally train talent, popularize cooperative education, and seek improvements in technical aspects. Cooperative technical personnel training courses and mobile cooperative technical lectures in various provinces and regions are scheduled to be implemented successively from mid-January next year. With the establishment of cooperative banks, substantial capital, and the easy development of cooperative enterprises, we aim to lay the foundation for improving rural cooperation.

2.  Industrial Construction: Industrial construction is the key to modernization and is closely related to the revival of the rural economy. Reviewing the industrial construction of the past year, there are several points that indicate progress. (1) Technical improvements. The improvement of industrial technology can be seen from the increase in patent approvals and industrial rewards. As of the end of November this year, 29 patents have been approved, which is a significant increase compared to 21 for the entire year last year and 25 for the entire year of 1934. We have adopted strict principles, rejecting more than 120 cases in the past eleven months. In terms of industrial rewards, as of the end of November, 11 exclusive manufacturing rights, 19 tariff exemptions, and 17 reductions in transportation costs for state-owned transportation enterprises have been approved, totaling 49 cases, which is 11 more than the 36 cases for the entire year last year. (2) Revitalizing large and small industries. The large industries that have made progress this year include: 1. The Central Machine Factory, with an initial operating cost of 600,000 yuan and an equipment cost of more than 123,000 pounds. The machinery purchased in England has been shipped in batches this year. The factory building has also been completed with iron casting, steel casting, and machine factories. We are currently negotiating cooperation methods with the Ministry of Railways in order to secure sales and start operations soon. 2. Alcohol industry. In addition to the joint state-private China Alcohol Manufacturing Co., Ltd., which started operations in January last year, Shaanxi Province has re-established an alcohol factory and four factories for pressing oil and removing foreign iron cylinders, with a total capital of 2.3 million yuan. In November this year, Tianjin Machine Manufacturing Alcohol Co., Ltd. was also established with a total capital of 500,000 yuan. 3. Paper industry. The capital of the joint state-private Wenxi Paper Mill has been set at 4.5 million yuan, and is currently underway. Guangdong Province has also established three new-style paper mills, and Fujian and Jiangxi provinces have also planned to reorganize the original paper industry. 4. Nitrogen industry. The sulfuric acid plant undertaken by Yongli Company in Liuhe County, Jiangsu Province, has completed all the factory buildings this year. In addition to the original company bonds of 5.5 million yuan, the factory has re-issued company bonds of 15 million yuan this year. The main facilities include sulfuric acid plant, nitric acid plant, synthetic ammonia plant, and water gas plant, which are large in scale. Also, Tianli Nitrogen Products Company, which had been preparing for a long time, has a capital of 1 million yuan. It officially started manufacturing at the beginning of this year, producing 8,000 pounds of liquid argon, 13,000 pounds of nitric acid, and 9,900 pounds of ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and ammonium chloride per year. 5. Vegetable oil industry. Vegetable oil is a major export commodity of our country. In 1935, oil exports reached 57,272,426 yuan, accounting for almost one-tenth of the total exports. Therefore, the rise and fall of the vegetable oil industry has a very significant impact on the entire national economy, especially tung oil. Almost all the tung oil needed in the world, except for Annam and India, is supplied by our country. According to customs statistics, since tung oil was listed separately under the vegetable oil category in 1913, it exceeded 3 million taels in that year, and has been increasing steadily since then. Although there have been occasional decreases in the middle years, it finally reached 41,582,879 yuan last year, jumping to the first place among export commodities. Its importance in international trade can be seen from this. However, due to the lack of purity in terms of quality and the lack of stability in terms of price and supply, the Ministry of Industry, in order to improve international reputation, has jointly established a vegetable oil plant in the tung oil producing areas of Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Guangxi provinces, with a capital of 2 million yuan, in cooperation between the government and private sector. Its main businesses are: (1) Agent for the storage and refining of tung oil; (2) Agent for the storage and refining of other vegetable oils; (3) Agent for undertaking mortgages, foreign exchange, customs declaration, transportation, and other matters that facilitate sales; (4) Refining lubricating oil; (5) Manufacturing oil paint coatings. The general office is located in Hankou, and oil plants are planned to be established in Shanghai, Hankou, Changsha, Changde, Wanxian, and Chongqing. The factory sites in Shanghai and Wanxian have been located, and the designs for the oil plants in Chongqing, Changde, Changsha, and Hankou are also in progress, and all can start operations in the middle of next year. In addition, new-style pressing machines will be purchased and distributed to various provinces to improve local pressing, in order to reduce costs and increase oil quality. 6. Sugar industry. The sugar industry has made more progress in recent years. The publicly operated ones include the sugar factories operated by Guangdong Province, and the newly established Neijiang Sugar Factory in Sichuan, with a capital of 10 million yuan, and the first phase of funding being 2 million yuan. The first factory will be built first, producing about 10,000 tons of sugar per year. Five factories will be completed successively within five years, with an annual output of 50,000 tons of sugar. Also, the Shandong Sugar Factory operated by Puyi Industrial Company was established in 1920 and was the first to use sugar beet to make sugar in our country. The capital is 2.5 million yuan. The factory is located at Huangtai Bridge in Jinan. The main product is machine-made white sugar, with an annual output of about 10,000 tons. If the sugar beet raw materials are sufficient, it can be increased to 50,000 tons. An alcohol factory is attached, using the waste honey left over from sugar production as a raw material for brewing alcohol. It was suspended in 1927 due to the political situation. It has been restarted in 1935 and has started manufacturing. The above points are also sufficient to get a glimpse of the improvement of the industrial situation in our country this year. However, the flour industry, the textile industry, and the silk industry are all important industries in our country. Due to the dumping of foreign goods and the impact of smuggling in North China, business is still difficult to expand. As for private small factories, 116 new factories have been registered this year, with a capital of more than 1,872,000 yuan. (3) Joint production and sales of the match industry. In recent years, the match industry has been in dire straits. In March of this year, the method of joint production and sales was specially approved. Cooperating with each other to limit production, 58 Chinese factories, 2 American factories, and 7 Japanese factories have joined. The business future has improved significantly. In short, the slight improvement in the above-mentioned industrial phenomena is just a small glimmer of light from the joint efforts of the people of the country. How to promote the future industry needs our continued efforts. For next year's industrial plan, the government believes that a national industrial distribution plan must be formulated: (1) Which heavy industries should be run by the central government; (2) Which light industries should be promoted by the central government and run by the people; (3) Which local industries should be subsidized by the central government and run independently or jointly by the provinces; (4) Which special industries should be subsidized by the central government and run jointly by the relevant provinces. The sources of capital, and the adjustment of supply and demand must be thoroughly discussed in order to avoid duplication, clarify responsibilities, and conduct a joint effort. We have now received an order from the President to complete this task by the beginning of next year (1937).

3.  Commercial Construction: The more important commercial construction projects in the past year include: (1) The preparation for the establishment of the National Goods Joint Sales Company. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry, this company will be temporarily organized by the central and local governments, national goods factories, and national goods companies, jointly raising funds. The capital is temporarily set at 2 million yuan, with the government jointly contributing one-third, and the national goods factories and companies jointly contributing two-thirds, using this as the center for promoting national goods. It has received sympathy from all parties, and the preparatory office has been established. (2) Establishment of a National Product Inspection Committee. Most national products do not have standard grades, are not suitable for modern trade, and are not conducive to sales. A National Product Inspection Committee was specially established in February this year, selecting experts as members, and successively holding inspections of Qimen Tunxi tea and Hunan rice, which is convenient for merchants. (3) Assisting the Nanyang commercial investigation. The China Industrial National Goods Trade Association believes that there are many overseas Chinese in Nanyang and trade is important. Therefore, it organized a Nanyang commercial investigation group this year, and carried national products for exhibitions on the spot. The Ministry of Industry provided assistance to this group. The group went abroad on July 16 and returned to Shanghai on October 26, passing through the Philippines and British, French, and Dutch ports, and received a warm welcome from the overseas Chinese. (4) Promoting international trade. The world economy showed a slight improvement this year, which was a good opportunity to promote overseas trade. The Ministry of Industry saw this and engaged in many activities, such as (1) increasing the inspection of export commodities. Major exports such as asphalt, which amounts to about 120,000 metric tons per year, and imports such as cotton seeds, which are also large in number, have been inspected. Grading and inspection of raw silk have also been implemented. (2) Promoting the export of tea and fruits. Special groups have been established in the International Trade Bureau. (3) Preparing to establish an import and export commodity management office. The method is under review. (4) Establishing a commercial attache in Japan. All are incentives to adjust international trade. The international trade situation has also improved this year. The import surplus has decreased relatively compared to last year. Comparing January to October of this year with the same period last year, the import surplus decreased from 336,550,548 yuan to 226,404,925 yuan, a decrease of 110,145,623 yuan (January was an export surplus). Domestic commerce has also been more active, which is perhaps a gratifying phenomenon.

4.  Mining Construction: There are also several points in mining construction that are worth mentioning. (1) Increasing private mining rights. From January to the end of November this year, the Ministry of Industry issued 166 private mining licenses, with a total area of 11,746 hectares, 38 ares, 28 millimeters, and 8,226 meters. There are 56 private small mining licenses, with a total area of 325 hectares, 27 ares, and 77 millimeters. There are 5 private prospecting licenses, with a total area of 354 hectares, 66 ares, 36 millimeters, and 4,991 meters. Among them, there are 128 coal mines, 2 barite mines, 4 asbestos mines, 6 fire clay mines, 1 arsenic mine, 1 kaolin mine, 4 gypsum mines, 2 mica mines, 3 graphite mines, 7 fluorite mines, 1 marble mine, 2 sulfur mines, 10 gold mines, 1 silver mine, 15 ore mines, 23 antimony mines, 2 manganese mines, 4 lead mines, 2 tin mines, 3 copper mines, 1 hoe mine, and 3 iron mines (small mines). (2) Oil exploration. The importance of oil is well known. "A drop of oil in wartime is like a drop of blood in the human body." There is no definitive conclusion on the oil problem in our country. Exploration work is urgent. The central government and the Shaanxi provincial government have cooperated in exploration. Oil layers have been penetrated in Yanchang and Yanchuan. Sichuan has also purchased machinery and will first explore in Jiangjin. Various research institutions are also actively conducting experiments on low-temperature oil refining. (3) Reorganizing the tungsten and antimony mining industries. The export trade of tungsten and antimony mineral sands is very large, but there is no plan, which can easily lead to abuses. Offices have been set up separately to reorganize and improve foreign trade. (4) Joint sales of the coal industry. The coal industry is extremely depressed due to mutual competition. On June 1st of this year, the Ministry of Industry specially convened a joint meeting of major coal mining companies, and on August 15th, the Coal Mining Industry United Office of the Republic of China was officially established in Shanghai, with the aim of jointly improving transportation and sales methods.

5.  Fisheries and Forestry Construction: (1) The establishment of the Shanghai Fishery Market, with a capital of 1.2 million yuan, is fully equipped with new facilities. From its opening on May 11 to the end of October, the accumulated operating income was 2,958,278.87 yuan for sea fish, 204,526.01 yuan for river fish, and 248,047.72 yuan for salted fish, totaling 3,410,854.8 yuan. (2) The preparation for the establishment of the Fishery Syndicate. The capital is divided into fixed and circulating capital, totaling 1 million yuan in the first year, and increasing year by year. The preparatory office was established in Shanghai on November 7th of this year. (3) Forestry construction. Regarding afforestation in the Northwest and other provinces, the provincial governments are urged to implement it separately. In the capital area, the number of surviving trees planted in the spring in the Jinzigang area was 2,463,731, and the number of surviving seedlings was 5,400,667.

In addition, the construction most closely related to the Ministry of Industry, such as the highway construction of the National Economic Council, has developed very rapidly. As of the end of June this year, the total length of the road lines was 163,715 kilometers, of which 97,472 kilometers were open to traffic and 16,793 kilometers were under construction. The total length of connecting roads in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Fujian, and the Northwest provinces as of October was 23,478 kilometers. In terms of railway construction, since the policy of reorganizing old roads and building new roads was implemented, the transportation of old roads has improved daily. The number of new roads has been increasing daily, and according to the President's five-year railway plan, it was decided to complete 8,139 kilometers of road lines within five years, breaking the 54-year record of only 8,111 kilometers (the current railway mileage in the country, excluding more than 2,000 kilometers outside the customs, is only this number). Currently completed lines include Tongpu Zhushao, Huainan, Nanyu, Tongsi, Sujia, and other lines. Those under construction include Xiangqian Chengyu, Jinggui, Nanping, Xibao, Hangshao and other lines. Those that have begun surveying include Baocheng Qiankun, Chuanqian Guangmei, Xianggui, Eshen, Bangzheng and other lines. Water conservancy construction such as: (1) The Daohuai River project, which has cost more than 20 million yuan over the years, will soon be completed. (2) The Yellow River water conservancy project, in addition to the breach-blocking and bank protection project, and the canal intermodal transport project, cost more than 10 million yuan. (3) The Yangtze River water conservancy project, such as the Jinshui gate construction in Hubei, the Wusong Yujidun bay interception, the Baimao River control gate, and the Jianghan main dike annual repair and other projects, cost more than 23 million yuan. (4) North China water conservancy projects, such as the Haihe management, the Hutuo River irrigation, the Longfeng River estuary gate construction, the Sanggan River first siltation area, and the Yongding River middle reaches reinforcement, cost a total of 10 million yuan. (5) South China water conservancy projects, such as the flood control projects in the Dongjiang, Xijiang, and Beijiang rivers, the Chencun River dredging, the opening of Huangpu Port, and the construction of quays in Kaiping Chikan, cost more than 4 million yuan. (6) Northwest water conservancy projects, such as the Shaanxi Jinghui Canal, Luohui Canal, Meihui Canal, Tao River Canal, and Ningxia Yunting Canal, cost a total of 5 million yuan. The reduction in natural disasters and the bumper harvest of agricultural products in recent years may not be unrelated to human affairs.

In summary, the above is just about the major industrial construction projects. With the vast territory of our country and the autumn of revival from ruins, a little construction is only one-thousandth or one-two-thousandth. The future is vast and requires a lot of effort. The government cannot but hope to work together with the people to move forward.

### New Year's Message

— Zhou Shoujuan

(1) To my pessimistic self, after being happy for a while when the National Army recovered Bailing Temple, I didn't expect that extreme joy would turn to sorrow. On December 12th of the 25th year of the Republic, I received the bad news of the Zhang Yang rebellion in Xi'an. I felt like I had been punched in the heart and was knocked down into a dark cloud, feeling depressed. It wasn't until 6:45 p.m. on December 25th when I heard the good news on the radio that Chairman Chiang had escaped and returned to Luoyang that I suddenly felt the dark clouds dissipate and saw the clear moon and bright wind again. So, I cancelled out my depression and happily rejoiced until today, New Year's Day. I am now in a happy mood to say a few words to the readers of the "Women and Children" special issue.

Looking back on the past year, the women's and children's circles in the country have indeed realized the seriousness of the national crisis and no longer live in extravagance and frivolity. They have gradually been able to work hard in their work. This is a very optimistic phenomenon. Especially after the Suiyuan War of Resistance broke out, women all over the country were sewing clothes with thousands of needles and threads to keep the soldiers on the front lines warm, and children all over the country were running around collecting money to relieve the hunger of the soldiers on the front lines. This is indeed a very effective stimulant to encourage the soldiers to bravely kill the enemy.

Since Chairman Chiang suffered misfortune during the Xi'an Incident, women and children across the country have also expressed their deep and sincere feelings. We have heard female students crying bitterly and worrying that the overall national situation will be unmanageable. Even my seven-year-old son, when returning from school, was shouting the slogan "If Chairman Chiang doesn't come out, China will be in trouble." This is enough to show that both women and children are concerned about national affairs and know that the country is lovable. In the past, pessimistic people, in view of the decline of national sentiment, often sighed and said, "If China doesn't perish, there is no reason." But after seeing the recent phenomena, I optimistically said, "If China perishes, there is no reason."

Today is New Year's Day in the 26th year of the Republic. Chairman Chiang is already presiding over national affairs and leading the entire nation to struggle for survival. I hope that women and children across the country will follow their husbands or parents and work together for the motherland. Know that this is not just Chairman Chiang's business, it is the business of our entire nation. Whether it is women or children, they must shrug their shoulders and help him to carry this heavy burden of saving the country together.

### Chinese Women in 1937

— Shouzhen

China in 1936 passed amidst suffering. During this year, China endured the bullying of enemies, and even at the year's end, internal disgrace occurred! The demented traitors, not content with losing the four northeastern provinces, were preparing to forfeit the entire Republic of China! After agonizing reflection, we compatriots across the nation spent this hateful and shameful end of the year in grief and indignation!

Now, 1937 is beginning, and the crisis of the nation and the people weighs on the heads of every one of our citizens, whether male or female, old or young.

Today, the first day of the new year, we must use our new vision and new aspirations to prepare for struggle! Our female compatriots throughout China must stand on the same battle line as our male compatriots, support the government, help the government, resist enemies externally, eliminate traitors internally, and assist in construction, contributing one measure of strength to our nation for every measure we have, and doing one measure of work for the nation for every measure of talent we possess. Here, I would like to propose a few small plans to discuss with our female compatriots.

First, starting from today this year, let us all strive to enrich our own strength. Those of us who lack knowledge should study diligently. Those who lack experience should work hard. Those who lack common sense should engage with society as much as possible, learning from all aspects to improve ourselves. We must not sit idly by, complaining about others, nor should we vainly hope for others to assist us. Only in this way can we have real strength to contribute to society.

Second, we must do our utmost to restrain extravagance and increase production. On the one hand, we should strive to save on our own expenses, ensuring that not a single penny is wasted unnecessarily. On the other hand, we should do what we can within our abilities, absolutely not belittling ourselves or relying on men. For this is sufficient to affect the wealth of the entire nation and society through the economy of each family. We can only activate the national economy by reducing the burden on families.

Third, we must clearly see the current state of our country and the current global situation. We must begin to study various domestic and foreign issues and determine our own aspirations, not only resolutely supporting the country ourselves, but also instilling correct ideas into our young children, nurturing a healthy next generation of citizens.

Fourth, we must bravely and resolutely express to our male compatriots that we hope they will not underestimate our strength in the future. The cause is created by the entire people, regardless of male or female. We will not stand on the opposite battle line from them. We are all united. In various departments, they need our help, and we need their help. In short, everyone takes saving the country as the goal.

China in 1937 must rise from the heavy pressure! Chinese women in 1937 have also awakened from the heavy veils! Dear female compatriots, I believe you are all willing to offer this new model to women around the world!

### ### Women of the 26th Year of the Republic

— Yilong

The wheels of time keep moving forward. 1936, universally recognized as a year of war crisis, has passed peacefully. The new history of 1937 will unfold before our eyes. Will it bring war, or perhaps peace? Let's not talk about that for now, but first talk about the first question for us women ourselves.

Over the past year, Chinese women have also moved forward along with the wheels of time. Although, on the one hand, we see many urban women indulging in a life of makeup, on the other hand, we have seen thousands upon thousands of women shouting enthusiastic cries and shedding bright red blood. Especially since the outbreak of the war of resistance against the enemy in eastern Suiyuan, women across the country, even dancers and prostitutes (prostitutes in Suiyuan Province once organized a comfort group to go to the front lines), have been awakened by the sound of the enemy's cannons. Those with strength contributed strength, and those with money contributed money. Although this kind of women fighting for national survival cannot mobilize women from all walks of life to unite in a general mobilization, it at least shows the new growth of the Chinese women's movement in 1936, and at the very least, it has made the gentry who drive women back to the kitchen speechless.

Because the unprecedented crisis of the nation has fueled the rise of the women's movement. As a result, the advancing women of China in 1936 grew up in struggle. In 1937, we should hope to implement this spirit even more, and strive to learn the heroic posture of the women of the People's Front in the Spanish Civil War, and learn the revolutionary spirit of the martyr Qiu Jin. The first question for us women—striving for thorough national equality and freedom—can only grasp the banner of victory. Then, our two hundred million sisters can have a happy life like Soviet women and a free life like women in the newly emerging country of Turkey.

In the New Year's Day, we shouldn't talk about such disappointing problems in such a melancholy way. We should talk about how women seek happiness in the New Year and how to beautify themselves, but I honestly think about it, in today's severe national crisis, I feel that this first question for women is more important than anything else, and I can't help but write it out with enthusiasm. Finally, let me write down a few words from Mr. Jiping's interview with Ms. Yang Yixi again as my motto for Chinese women in 1937:

"Women's liberation cannot be realized independently of national liberation; if we women want to seek liberation, we should awaken women across the country to organize a united front to eliminate our enemies, feudal remnants, and imperialism."

### ### Family National Defense Education

— Fohua

Respect and love the national flag　Recover lost territories　Make games military　Help the anti-enemy soldiers

### ### New Year Fortune Telling

— Lu Guowei

Children, today is New Year's Day. We should take advantage of the first day of the year to divine our own destiny and try to predict the good and bad luck in the coming year. I now have an interesting and scientific fortune-telling method to introduce to you.

Below are five questions about the fate of children during the year:

1. Will I be happy this year?

2. Will I be healthy this year?

3. Will I be promoted this year?

4. Will I encounter any unexpected disasters this year?

5. Which day will be my happiest this year?

After reading these five questions, children can choose one that you want to tell you the answer. For example, if you choose the fifth question, "Which day will be my happiest this year," you can take a needle, close your eyes, and arbitrarily prick a small hole in the fortune-telling table behind. Then open your eyes and see which row the needle hole falls on. If the needle hole is in the first row, then check the first answer table. If it is in the second row, then check the answer table. Now, suppose the needle hole falls in the first row, you check the first answer table to see what the fifth answer that matches the fifth question you asked earlier is. The answer is: "The day when the national army wipes out the puppet bandits will be your happiest day."

Below are the fortune-telling table and answer table

### ### Fortune-Telling Table

### ### First Answer Table

### ### Second Answer Table

### ### Third Answer Table

### ### Family Forum

— Hu Yeyin

If there are many children in a family, it is usually considered very troublesome; because children mostly like to move, so one day they are either quarreling and making noise, or you and I are not in harmony, and I can't get along with you. Adults feel that this kind of behavior is too annoying, so they shout loudly, or get angry and beat them up. As a result, the children cry and shout, but the result is still zero; the children make trouble, no matter how angry you get.

My family is like this. It's usually okay because they all go to school. Saturdays and Sundays are really terrible, simply killing people with noise.

In order to solve such a difficult problem, I proposed a family forum. The method is as follows: a meeting is held once a week, presided over by the mother or older children, but some refreshments should be prepared to help the elegant mood. There is no ceremony for the meeting. Everyone sits around the waist and mother tries to talk about things that are beneficial to the children, but it should not be a stern face, but lively and interesting: then each child should tell a story, or tell a joke, a riddle, or sing a song. Everyone laughs happily, and there are refreshments to eat.

Don't look at such a small family forum, its significance is very great. This is also considered a kind of family activity, and it contains very deep educational meaning: it can enable children to learn many things while talking and laughing, and it can also enable them to practice the ability to express opinions, because they must first prepare themselves before participating. If he reads a story and retells it, his ability to express himself will be practiced invisibly. Moreover, the mother can choose some older children to be the chairman, in order to create leadership talents.

On the negative side, it can reduce the time when children are naughty. Because they have to participate in this gathering, they must first prepare, or find a story, a joke: ... this will take them a lot of time to turn over books and look for them. When they read more books, they will play less?

Finally, if a family forum can be presided over well, the person presiding over can give systematic speeches to increase the children's organized knowledge, which is of great benefit to family education.

This is just a suggestion, and I hope for the guidance of housewives who implement it.

### ### Welcoming the New Year

— Sun Jingwen

Another year has come. Children, everyone is one year older. What do you feel?

Wild children who have not been lucky enough to go to school only feel that the weather is cold, the northwest wind is blowing tightly, the clothes on their bodies are too broken, and they are shivering... What another year has come? They are at a loss!

But what about the lucky children who have books to read! Ah! The big exam at school is coming soon, and winter vacation is coming soon. Or they will also think of getting one year older... The others are at a loss.

Really, in this era, not to mention children, even adults! Who isn't at a loss!

The new year has arrived. What "daily new, and again new" rotten tune, shouting is enough to be heartbroken! How can we bear to deceive innocent children and anesthetize children? Let's all celebrate the New Year happily! Pitiful China in this era, how to celebrate!

The fact does tell us that the new year has come again. Although the new year unfolding in front of us is a bit dim, no one can escape it, and everyone has to live.

Undoubtedly, we should spend this new year well.

We all know that the enemy's oppression is getting more and more severe every day. Is this new year the year of national subjugation? No one dares to say for sure. But if our entire nation has an awareness of "seeking survival from war," we can believe that China will never perish. So is this new year the year of the revival of the Chinese nation? No one dares to say for sure either.

Children! Do you understand? The new year that is coming will determine the survival of our country and will determine whether we will be slaves. Are we willing to see China perish? Are we willing to be slaves of a conquered country?

We children, of course, can't shoulder guns and go to the front line to fight the enemy, but we can also do indirect work to save the country.

The new year has arrived. The following things that I talk about here, children should recognize and do!

Report what you know about current affairs to illiterate people.

Encourage your parents to work hard to save the country.

Especially work hard on your own studies.

Pay special attention to national affairs.

At any time, you should cry and shout, and send out your great innocent voices to inspire the courage of the entire nation to fight the enemy to the death.

### ### Happy New Year

(1) Wear new clothes (2) Wear a new hat (3) Be a new person

### ### Children's Free Drawing

### ### Don't Waste Money

— Du Yemu

On the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year, a bright and warm sun hung in the sky, which is exactly what the children were happy about. Ming'er, Zhi'er, Hui'er, and Mei'er, all four of them were wearing new clothes, even their hats, shoes, and socks were new. Of course, they were very happy, and their conversations were not as rude as usual, but today they were all speaking very politely.

Ming'er said: "I have four silver dollars. I want to buy a large foreign doll."

Zhi'er said: "I have three. I want to buy a small bicycle."

Hui'er said: "I have three too. I want to buy a foreign doll too."

Mei'er said: "I don't want anything. I want to buy a big leather ball!"

As she spoke, everyone laughed for a while. The stall selling small firecrackers was being carried over. Ah! The stall selling candies was also being carried over!

Zhi'er said: "I want to buy slam firecrackers!"

Ming'er said: "I want to buy cream candies to eat!"

Just as they were talking, suddenly Guo'er jumped over. Everyone was very happy to see Guo'er coming: "Guo'er, it's good that you came! Let's all buy some slam firecrackers and have a battle, shall we?" Hui'er said this. But Mei'er said: "Let's buy some milk candies and everyone roll copper coins, shall we?" Ming'er jumped up and shouted: "Okay, okay!"

But Guo'er said: "Children! Isn't our China very dangerous? Aren't the enemy troops attacking us in Suiyuan now? Children! We should save money and donate it to the soldiers on the front line who are resisting the enemy. You must know that the respectable and beloved soldiers on the front line are fighting the enemy with blood and flesh. We people in the rear should also contribute money if we have money, so I donated all the New Year's money that my parents gave me to the soldiers on the front line who are resisting the enemy. In the future, when our nation is free and liberated, then won't our New Year be even happier?"

Everyone thought that Guo'er's words were very correct. Everyone did not waste money, and decided to save the money and donate it to the soldiers on the front line who were resisting the enemy.

### ### Standing on the Same Front Line

— Kangjian Zhai Fu

On the morning of the Yunnan Uprising Anniversary, that is, Easter, foreigners, old and young, men and women, were celebrating and welcoming the arrival of 1937. But we, the people of the whole country who have a little knowledge, regardless of age, gender, are frowning and inwardly trembling, fearing that a great disaster is about to come, and that the nation and the people will fall into eternal destruction: everyone is wholeheartedly hoping that the Xi'an mutiny incident can be resolved one minute earlier; our leader can escape danger one minute earlier, so that our country, our entire nation, can get rid of the clouds and see the light again. Only then can all our people, old and young, men and women, eat New Year's Eve dinner more comfortably and welcome the arrival of the 26th year of the Republic of China.

Sure enough, that evening, the telegram came that our leader had safely escaped danger. The entire city of Shanghai was immediately filled with firecrackers and cheers. Needless to say, the entire Chinese people in China and even overseas would be as enthusiastically happy as if they were drunk and crazy after receiving this news; I don't know how many thousands of men, women, old and young would be so happy that they would shed tears. When we read Chairman Chiang's instructions to Zhang Yang in Xi'an, even people of iron and stone would be moved to tears. With this, turning misfortune into good fortune, everyone can almost relax and celebrate the New Year.

It turns out that this Xi'an mutiny, where the leader suffered, during the fourteen days from beginning to end, the news reported in the newspapers showed the popular sentiment and public opinion, which can be regarded as giving our entire nation an extremely broad, precise and accurate psychological test. During these fourteen days, the people across the country were indignant and nervous, and the sincere expressions of grief and joy were not faked at all. The reason why there are such consistent and sincere expressions of concern is because our entire nation has suffered unprecedented humiliation and encountered serious national disasters that everyone has never experienced in their lives in recent years. Everyone has clearly understood in their hearts that in order to get rid of this unprecedented humiliation and to get rid of this extremely serious national disaster, except for following our hardworking and struggling supreme leader, standing on the same front line and fighting the enemy to the death, there is no second path to be found. If the battle line of our nation loses its true leader and returns to the previous situation of one country with three public officials and no leader, then our own front line will be chaotic first, and then the enemy will break it without attacking it. Isn't this called "self-inflicted sins cannot be survived"?

Today is the New Year's Day of the 26th year of the Republic of China. What we can celebrate is that all our people, men, women, old and young, even those who have gone astray in the past, are now united and give a "group New Year's greeting" to our government and our leader. From now on, we will resolutely stand on the same front line!

### ### New Year Thoughts

— Jiping

"Year after year passes, and the national fortune has not changed!" These two sentences can probably represent the psychology of ordinary people. Of course, the unification of the country and the success of national policies are not matters of a day or two. But I believe that our nation, after so many years of suffering, has made considerable progress, and there is a glimmer of light in the future. People used to say: "If China does not perish, there is no justice!" Now it can be changed to "If China does not perish, there is natural justice!"

To celebrate the New Year, we must have the spirit of inheriting the past and opening up the future. Everyone reflects on the mistakes of last year and sets the plan for this year: How will I strive for myself and change to social service? Serve the country? This is the great way to save the country in one's own position.

The family is a cell in the national organization. It must first be well-organized to enjoy happiness. I have never seen a corrupt family that can produce excellent citizens. Therefore, a happy family is the starting point for promoting all our undertakings; and most of this responsibility rests on the shoulders of women.

Children in the past only knew how to be filial to their parents, but modern children must love the country even more. You should understand that my survival is protected by the country, and the survival of the country depends entirely on the power of the people. Therefore, children should strive to cultivate the five educations, and it is better to say that they are preparing to be loyal to the country than to repay the kindness of their parents in the future.

Starting from the 26th year, children should earnestly take on the responsibility of "little teachers", and immediately convey the knowledge they have acquired to those who have dropped out of school. Naturally, teachers are the advocates of the "little teacher system"!

### ### Little Black Charcoal Spends the New Year

— Written by Jiang Yuqi

㊀ The New Year has arrived, let's all beat the gongs and drums.

㊁ "Ten-Turn Gongs and Drums" are very lively.

㊂ We walk all the way, beat all the way, the louder the better.

㊃ Haha! Little Black Charcoal's bronze drum is broken.

### ### A Foreign Doll

— Qin Chen

On a New Year's Day when the sun shines all over the earth, although the season has not yet jumped out of the scope of winter, when the wind blows on people's faces, they don't feel cold at all; especially those children who are running, shouting, and messing around on the street, in the yard, and indoors are particularly excited. Their little faces are flushed, and some of them are sweating!

K City is a remote county far away from big cities. It is usually very quiet, but once New Year's Day comes, the air suddenly becomes much more tense. Schools and shops are hanging up national flags, and women and children are putting on new clothes. Those who sell clay figures, picture albums, and masks are doing very good business. Although the quiet residential areas like Houshi Street have also added a lot of noise, most of which belongs to children! Because no vehicles or horses have ever passed through the street, those children have occupied the entire street in groups; some are playing with clay grandmas, some are wielding knives and guns, some are pulling tops, and some are waving small paper flags. Almost none of them are empty-handed. If there is one, it is Xiao Wei!

Today, the neighbors have more toys, a very large foreign bronze drum, a very nice little horn; all the toys that can be bought in K City are spread out in front of him, but he can't touch them at all. He can only stand aside in a daze. His only hope is to wait for his mother to come home at night and bring him a mask that she promised him; but he hasn't even eaten dinner, and it's still so long until night, how can he bear it? He thinks that Wu Bao in the big room is usually the best to him, maybe Wu Bao will be willing to lend him his little leather ball to roll for a while? But as soon as he opened his mouth, Wu Bao made a face and left. He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry, when suddenly two people came from the east, one carrying a pole, and a guest wearing foreign clothes. They asked a few words to an old man on the street, and that old man pointed at himself. The guest immediately put on a smiling face and ran over to hug him.

"Are you Xiao Wei? Where's Mom? I'm your dad!" The man said excitedly.

Of course, Xiao Wei doesn't know his dad! He doesn't even know that he has a dad: he doesn't know what good it is for him, but his face is flushed and he's about to cry; his dad knows he's unfamiliar with him, so he opens a paper package clipped under his waist, takes out a small foreign man with eyes and limbs that can move, and gives it to him with a smile. Xiao Wei was in a daze,

"A foreign doll! A foreign doll!" All the children around shouted.

Dad then signaled the porter to carry a few pieces of luggage into the house, and Xiao Wei smiled tightly holding the foreign doll.

### Celebrating New Year's Day

— I

Celebrating New Year's Day is originally a routine article. Since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty-five New Year's Days have passed. This year's New Year's Day is the twenty-sixth. Isn't it an ordinary and extremely mundane thing, like a child growing to twenty-six years old?

Therefore, writing articles celebrating New Year's Day is like writing birthday prefaces for others. No matter what the person is like, you always have to write a few sentences of congratulatory clichés and string together a few far-fetched and contrived praises to flatter them. Otherwise, it wouldn't seem like a birthday celebration preface, and it would lose the meaning of celebration.

Since the establishment of the Republic of China, although twenty-five New Year's Days have passed, we have been living through internal troubles and external threats, natural disasters and man-made calamities. Even if we wanted to string together a few congratulatory words, they would be artificial and not easy to feel sincerely. It's either looking back on the past or hoping for the future, which has become an old tune. Not only is it unsettling to write, but the listeners are also inevitably tired of it. However, this year, the celebration is different. There are three solid and genuine reasons for celebration that have never existed before, and they must be written about in detail to inform the readers.

First, the unification of the Republic of China. Although the slogan of unifying the whole country has been chanted for a long time, true unification has not yet been achieved. Since Chen Jitang stepped down and went abroad last year, the southwestern leaders have cooperated with the central government with one heart and mind, as close as brothers. Not only is the politics unified, but also the military; not only the military, but also the economy. This situation is really the best situation since the Republic of China. This is the first thing to celebrate.

Second, the recovery of Bailing Temple. The situation in North China has been disrupted by bandits and traitors since the September 18th Incident, and it is almost impossible to manage. The battle of Bailing Temple last year caused heavy losses to bandits and puppets, who dared not underestimate us. Although Bailing Temple is an inherent territory of our country, it has been completely occupied by bandits and puppets in recent years, so government orders could not be implemented. Recently, we fought hand-to-hand to take it back. Such a victory can be regarded as the first major victory in the history of the Republic of China. In the future, we can work hard to recover lost territories and restore national rights. This is the second thing to celebrate.

Third, Generalissimo Chiang's safe return to Nanjing after escaping danger. The Xi'an Incident was indeed beyond our expectations. People generally worried about Generalissimo Chiang's safety. Unexpectedly, within two weeks, Zhang and Yang were able to come to their senses and happily send Generalissimo Chiang back to Nanjing, and Zhang also came to Nanjing to plead guilty. This is not only a victory of the national people's psychology, but also due to Generalissimo Chiang's efforts in nationalization. This turned a disaster into a blessing, which is a miracle in history. This is the third thing to celebrate.

In addition, last year's nationwide harvest and the people's prosperous life are not enough to be celebrated. However, these three facts are not accidental. They must be the result of Generalissimo Chiang's great achievements of hard work in recent years and his far-sighted plans. Therefore, the past achievements are like this, and the future hope is endless. Therefore, past New Year's Days had nothing to celebrate, but this year's New Year's Day should be celebrated by the whole country.

### Having Words is Worse Than Having None

— Lingxi

Firecrackers bid farewell to the old year;

New peach charms for thousands of households.

Jingchu Chronicle of Seasons: "Boards are set up next to the door, made of peach wood, and painted with the images of the gods Shen Tu and Yu Lei to suppress evil, called peach charms." Because they are changed every three years, they become a story of the New Year, and later spring couplets became peach charms.

In the new year of universal renewal, everything in the world should be spruced up. Even if the people in the house are so miserable that they have no food to eat or clothes to wear, the façade must be decorated. So no matter how dirty or how old the two large doors are, the blood-red spring couplets must be pasted. If you run through the streets and alleys in the New Year, you can prove that what I said is not a lie. If the cycle goes on and on, and everything is really renewed, then this renewal should be reflected in the spring couplets. This also shows that Chinese people love to work hard on the façade and value it more than anything else.

Speaking of spring couplets, I remembered an anecdote. Although I can remember it, I can't remember it clearly. It was about a scholar in a certain place. When the end of the year was approaching, the villagers bought red paper and sincerely asked him to write spring couplets. He didn't refuse and accepted all the red paper. On New Year's Eve, the villagers asked him for the spring couplets. He was in no hurry and returned the rolls of red paper to everyone. They took the red paper and pasted it on the gate, but saw that there wasn't a single word on it. They went to question the scholar, who replied with a smile: "Having words is worse than having none!" The word "words" is a homophone for "affairs." Chinese people are born afraid of trouble, and who doesn't want to have a peaceful and uneventful year? So after hearing the scholar's words, they felt that the auspicious words were good and expressed their joy and gratitude. Since then, it is said that the spring couplets in that place have no words, becoming a fashion. Upon researching this reason, I know that it is not purely for auspicious words. Half of the reason is that it is not easy for country people to find someone to write spring couplets, so they feel that having words is worse than having none. Originally, spring couplets are troublesome things!

New Year's newspapers want to publish special issues, I don't know what good man came up with this idea. Therefore, people who can write can't escape this New Year's hurdle, and they have to write a few words for people who are chasing them like debts. In fact, people who can write are not as stingy as rich people who pluck a hair. It's just that it's not good to write randomly at this time of year, and they often write messy words. In the New Year, everyone wants to get lucky. If they write some trouble for writing words, wouldn't it be a bad omen for the whole year? So although I was forced to finally pick up the pen, I suddenly thought of the scholar's words, "Having words is worse than having none," and deeply felt that what he said is a warning for our friends who like to write.

Indeed, "Having words is worse than having none." Don't you see that newspapers often leave some blank space to harmonize the reader's eyesight because there are too many words written, which is not good? And readers also feel that "having words is worse than having none," and will give more interest and attention to the blank space left.

Therefore, I also think that it is really necessary to have "having words is worse than having none," so I don't want to write anything else besides writing the title. What I wrote above is just an aside, explaining the meaning of "having words is worse than having none."

### Sending Off the Old Year and Welcoming the New Year

— Wen

When the last page of December 31st is torn off the calendar, in a few hours, it will be the beginning of 1937. This transition will naturally evoke a different feeling in people's minds. When we say the two words "New Year," it seems that there is a "new" atmosphere waiting for us to approach it. If you want to say that "the New Year is really worth celebrating," then it is on this point of bright hope for the coming year.

I have thought carefully about why people have such a passionate heart of hope for the future in the exchange of a year. It must be that life was really not very good in the past year. At the end of the year, I can't wait for the bad luck of the past year to pass along with the passing of the year. In the coming year, we must try our best to make life go to good luck. It seems that there are two popular sayings in the society: "Toad hopes for sunny days, poor people hope for the coming year." According to this saying, I think toads must love sunny days and hate rainy days. After many days of unpleasant rain, it can only look forward to the sunny days coming soon. Similarly, poor people have lived a hard life for many years, and have no way out, only to hope for good luck at the end of the year. According to this saying, the reason why people place infinite hope on the coming New Year is precisely because the "old year" was too unsatisfactory. This reason is correct.

According to this, the reason why we are particularly enthusiastic about welcoming the New Year now is precisely because the past year was too uncomfortable. To be specific, there are too many uncomfortable things. Generally speaking: the oppression of people by people, the tragic killings, the shameless deception, responding to individuals, life is getting more and more difficult year by year... all kinds of dark scenes can be regarded as playing the past year. In this atmosphere of darkness and separation, we who have suffered so much, don't everyone have great hope for the coming year?

Hope is not wrong. It's just that the biggest problem is that we can't just hope in vain. Just like the toad's hope for sunny days to come, and the poor man's hope that he can have good luck next year, if we only satisfy ourselves with this kind of boring self-comfort, the result will definitely be the same as the poor man, spring goes and summer comes and winter comes again, and we will always spend each and every New Year in sadness and mourning. Our hope must be realized by practical actions, and hope must be based on reality. Only in this way can our hope be beneficial, and can guide us out of the abyss of pain and into the road of freedom and light.

Calculating the past year, the world has passed in painful struggles, with flesh and blood and shells flying across. Around us, the enemy's offensive has advanced another stage, and the various poisonous strategies of the traitors have far surpassed the ways of attacking our nation in the past. But on the other hand, we also see a bright road for our nation to move towards struggle. The nationwide enthusiastic support for the Sui Movement is one aspect of this struggle scene. We must also expand this increasingly expanding and deepening survival movement. So that we, who have been in oppression and slaughter for a long time, can finally raise the banner of freedom, step on all the defeated enemies, and sing our triumphal song. If we want to say that "the New Year" is really worth celebrating, then let us entrust our only hope to the year that is just beginning.

### Hopes for 1937

— Ruoying

I'm really afraid of such "topic assignments," but I have to write them. Well, let's list some hopes to welcome the just-arrived 1937.

My hopes are:

㊀ Forecasters should not make the terrible top predictions that World War II will break out this year. This is what we firmly oppose.

㊁ I hope that Abyssinia and Spain can, with the support of the world's people's front, recover their lost territories and consolidate their countries.

㊂ The time has come to the point where it is unbearable. I hope that the war of resistance against the enemy can start immediately, and that all the lost territories can be completely recovered within this year.

㊃ I hope that the great men and ordinary people of China can unite under the banner of resisting the enemy, resisting imperialism externally, and opposing feudal forces and traitors internally.

㊄ I hope that national defense literature, drama, and film will powerfully help the unity of the national salvation front. So that our works can become more lively and stronger trumpets of national salvation. They should be daggers, machine guns, and mortars, not dull and rusty things.

㊅ I hope that everyone will work hard to create and produce more meaningful works. Use your own life to enrich and complicate the content of your works. Oppose self-praise, mutual praise, closing doors, and all the strange phenomena in the literary world.

### I Want to Correct a New Year's Cliche

— Xinan

Get rich! Congratulations!

"Congratulations! Get rich!" When we meet during the New Year, everyone says this. It can be seen that everyone hopes to get rich, and the greatest purpose in life is, after all, to get rich.

However, "Congratulations, get rich" is still a bit of hope. Hope cannot necessarily become a reality. Therefore, I want to say this New Year's cliche in reverse, "Get rich! Congratulations!" "Only getting rich is worth" congratulations." If we regard hope as reality, it may actually become a reality.

To make getting rich a reality, you must have a way to make money. So, what is the way? Readers must ask this question when they see this, so let me tell you:

㊀ To "have the talent of money," you must have "the talent of no money;" only by having "the talent of no money" can you create "the talent of money."

㊁ To get rich, you also have to look at each person's "forehead." "Forehead" contains two meanings; the first saying is that "luck is on the forehead," because people who are walking on the right path must have a "shining" forehead, otherwise, people who are walking on the wrong path have a "dirty" forehead. But the "forehead" mentioned here refers to a "shining" forehead, not a "dirty" forehead. That is to say, getting rich depends on luck, and luck can also be said to be opportunity. The second saying is that getting rich ultimately requires using the brain, and the brain is in the forehead. According to a certain foreign psychologist, when a person uses their brain, there are often traces on the forehead, which cannot be seen with the naked eye, but can be measured with special machines, so the so-called "forehead" means that to get rich, it is also necessary to use the brain.

㊂ To get rich, you must have knowledge. Knowledge comes from books. Chinese people often use the words "wealth" and "sex" to tempt young people to study (in fact, it can be said that it is not temptation, but to cater to their preferences). They say, "There are houses of gold in books," and "There are beauties like jade in books." That is to say, to satisfy your desires for wealth and sex, you must bury yourself in books.

㊃ Some people say that what you said above is not right. Does studying necessarily lead to wealth! Don't you see that the more you study, the poorer you become, and the more knowledge you have, the less likely you are to get rich! However, this cannot be blamed on studying, but on why he is not smart enough, and has a poor appearance, and can only have a plain wife, live in a broken house, sit on a cold bench, and eat a bowl of salted rice. His fate is like this, what is there to complain about. The houses of gold and beauties like jade mentioned here are for people who can become officials by studying. Among all kinds of businesses in China, there is nothing like being an official with high profits and low capital. Although there are many honest and self-loving people, many of those who enter and exit beautiful wives and concubines, dancing pavilions, and foreign cars are nobles who "leap over the dragon gate in three stages, and become famous overnight." Therefore, those who study only want to become officials as the greatest and best way out, and they are not willing to risk great hardships and use capital to engage in industry and commerce.

㊄ "Having land is having wealth" is a saying that is certainly correct. Now there are land merchants who also have land, so, looking at the general trend, this year's land merchants can be very happy.

㊅ "Having wealth is having power" is a proverb. Those who have power have wealth because they have power, so everyone wants to curry favor with them. Because they want to curry favor, even if they have no wealth, they will have wealth. If those who have wealth have no power, it is hard not to say what will happen, but "a common man is not guilty, but possessing jade is a crime," precisely because they have no power. Therefore, power is also a most important condition for getting rich.

In short, congratulations can only be said when you get rich. Therefore, the first time I pick up a pen this year, I want to wish readers wealth! Congratulations! If you can get rich, then I will also get rich. Let me congratulate myself! Congratulations! Congratulations! To each other! To each other!

### New Year's Fun

— Zhou Muzhai

It's just celebrating the New Year, why do you have to say something temporary beforehand? If you say it's bitter, it's out of time and offends taboos. If you say it's happy, no matter how happy, happy, happy you say, it's not happy at all, it's very bitter. If you're not happy in the first place, but you insist on saying you're happy, the old-fashioned way of saying it is "forcing a smile," and the fashionable way of saying it is "a tearful smile," which is an appropriate example, close to a prostitute, which is one kind of bitterness. Even if you're happy, if you vent it out first, it's better to say what's bitter, and vent out your happiness, which is "although it's not said in words." Bitterness and happiness are opposites, which is a second kind of bitterness. New Year's Day, saying good things to unrelated people, especially those in the streets and alleys, beggars who suddenly appear in front and rush behind, writing articles to readers can generally be said to be unrelated, but saying good things in the New Year happens to have a ready-made term—"literary beggar," which is a third kind of bitterness. Mencius said: "A gentleman has three joys, and ruling the world is not one of them." Here it can be said that a petty person has three kinds of bitterness, being close to petty people and staying away from gentlemen, which is another kind of bitterness.

Having said that saying it's bitter is out of time and offends taboos, I also have to talk about the bitterness of saying it's happy, which is the same as being out of time and offending taboos. However, according to the meaning of venting happiness, "playing the qin under the Chinese cork tree, making fun of it in bitterness, may not be without gain. In this day and age, it's okay to say what's bitter, too. Because I had to say something temporary beforehand, I finally have something to say, which is another gain.

But this is after all saying the reason why, and it's certainly not saying the reason for. But I still feel that there's nothing to say, and I still have to "assume it." Then, the best way to celebrate the New Year is just to celebrate the New Year, but it must be without any discount of bitterness, or the discount should be smaller, and not overshadow the happiness of celebrating the New Year. So secondly, when speaking in the New Year, there must be things that can be said that are in time and do not offend taboos.

### Five Great Hopes

— Chen Wu

It's another manuscript for the New Year's special issue. As for my own major plans for the year, there are "secrets that cannot be revealed." Let's write a little about my hopes for the world and China.

First, I hope that the major powers of the world will all have many new colonies, and everyone will be "very satisfied."

Second, I hope that the red Soviet Union will collapse naturally without any effort from the major powers (especially Germany and Japan). Whether it is Semenov or someone else who comes to power, kills Stalin, digs up Lenin's tomb, and makes 90% of the workers and peasants become serfs again.

Third, I hope that the Spanish People's Front suddenly feels that they are wrong, and kneels outside the gate of Madrid to respectfully welcome Hitler's "Jade Teacher."

Fourth, I hope that Germany's Thalmann suddenly becomes a believer of Hitler?

Fifth (deleted)

Okay! Let's just have these five hopes. The last statement is naturally "It doesn't matter if I'm poor!"

### A Short Breath Sent to a Friend

— Ke Ling

×: Your letter has been received. When I picked up my pen to write back, I suddenly remembered that today is already the eve of New Year's Eve, and I couldn't help but feel a little surprised, and my heart even felt a little cold.

Another year! We heard my soul shout like this, and the voice was hoarse and heavy. I can't tell what these four words mean. Time is naturally very precious to mankind. It once created civilization, and it also ruthlessly destroys the old world; but the road of history is so long, we live in this tragic era, and what we play is just an insignificant role. A long string of precious days, like chewing chicken ribs, is spent in meaningless sorrow and fatigue. Occasionally, when I wake up, I think about this situation, and my soul is as painful as being bitten by a poisonous snake.

In this year, I spent the price of three hundred and dozens of days of life. What did I get for others and for myself?

You probably understand my temperament and believe that I am not such a selfish and muddled person. I am willing to live a more meaningful life. If my hands and brain can also contribute a little to promoting this era, I am willing to contribute everything I have. But what is pressing on me is a heavy burden of life, and my limited youth can only be buried in these ordinary and insignificant years. Friend, think about it for me, what a cruel punishment this society imposes on us!

I heard that you are going to Beiping after the New Year, and this news gave me a little sadness. But I think it's good for you to run away once if you have the opportunity. Living a peaceful life like stagnant water in an old small town may be a kind of happiness, but I always feel that this is a waste of life. In Beiping, the "cultural city" that barely survives under the enemy's iron hooves, you may be able to see a little more. After the New Year, because of the change of years, I hope you will also dare to change your life.

I've been in a bad mood these past few days, and as soon as I picked up my pen, I burst into so many complaints. However, ×, please rest assured that I still have the courage to live, and I am not pessimistic. Maybe I can become more solid in the future. I hope you will also give me encouragement.

I expect that when you receive this letter, it will be the beginning of the New Year, so let me wish you "Happy New Year" here.

Written hastily, I can't express all my thoughts. Winter is cold, I hope you take care!

### Writing to Myself

— Lin Na

New Year's Day Thoughts

Including this year, I have spent two New Years in Shanghai.

Last year on New Year's Day, I remember writing the following paragraph: "...Everyone, from the moment they are born, needs to eat, live in houses, and sleep. In other words,

Continued on page 5

## Page 37

## Page 38

## Page 39

: They all need to live. If they are not confused, I think they should all think about how to plan their lives from New Year's Day onwards. What the landlord and the farmer plan may be to buy a few more acres of land, plant a few more loads of grain, and buy a few more oxen within the possible range. As for myself? Not a landlord, nor a farmer, I don't have that many plans, just one wish: to talk less and do more..."

For a full twelve months, I fought life based on this unpretentious article, like a lone boat tossing in angry waves. Although there have been times when leaping angry waves have hit this lone boat, and there have been times when a storm has tried to capsize it and push it to the bottom of the sea. However, this lone boat struggled, breaking away from the raging waves. On the vast, restless sea, in the dark, stuffy nights, groping and crawling, heading towards the dawn. Now, I have safely passed a certain stage of the journey, and I am starting to set the second course for myself.

As the pages of the calendar are turned and torn off, there is always a strange feeling in my heart, lonely and desolate. I often ask myself: "Another day has passed, young man, on the journey of life, your life is also shorter by a day, but what have you done?" I am often ashamed, although I have done a lot of things this year, read a considerable number of books, and also written some articles. However, I have never been satisfied with myself. Sometimes I hold a competitive spirit and an explosive heart, and write with a pen. But when I look back at it a second time, I can't help but feel despair. I haven't written down the words I wanted to write. In this way, I believe that I have completely failed.

Two years ago, in a quiet village in the south, whenever the night was quiet, I often fell into dreamlike meditation. I kept thinking about the desert, thinking about the camel trudging with heavy burdens, and then it seemed that a voice was attached to my ear, saying in a low voice: "Just be a camel!" This voice often echoed in my ears, bewitching me. Finally, I decided to take a body of earthy air and a broken suitcase, like a camel, and step on the Bund, and live like a camel, full of courage and hope, without knowing fatigue, and without knowing failure. But now I am beginning to doubt whether this spirit is still there. The confidence to be a camel is a bit shaken.

"...Live a good life, young man, you have a future." This is the encouragement my friend gave me.

From this year on, I feel that I need to calm down even more, talk less, do more, don't disappoint my friends, and don't let myself be discouraged.

### Two Chapters of Unfeelingness on New Year's Day

— Wan Qiu

When I was young, the New Year's Day arrived, and I was busy wearing new clothes and flower hats; as I grew older, the New Year's Day arrived, and I was busy receiving distinguished guests, talking and reminiscing; when I was abroad, the New Year's Day arrived, and I was filled with thoughts of my homeland, inevitably gazing westward with melancholy. Each period, each period, had its own feelings for the New Year's Day during that time, although those feelings were all different.

But in recent years, after entering society, I have to rely on my own brainpower and physical strength to maintain my livelihood. All the beautiful dreams have disappeared, and cold reality is in front of me. Whether it is the New Year, the Old Year, New Year's Eve, or New Year's Day, without rice, I cannot cook, and without money, I cannot survive a single day. Whether it is the New Year or not, there is no difference at all, so now I have become unfeeling towards New Year's Day. (One of the Chapters on Unfeelingness of Old)

This unfeelingness is not limited to New Year's Day, but also to daily life. When I was studying at school, I often had dreams of endless hope, and life often contained some poetry, so the interest in writing novels and poems would spring up. But what about now? The books I read are words, the manuscripts I read are also words, and even when I meet friends and chat, I still cannot escape the realm of these "words." It is like a person who has eaten too much; as soon as I see words, my appetite feels bloated. Where does the interest in writing words come from? Therefore, I would like to advise friends who aspire to create that they must not choose the profession of editor. Once you become an editor, you will reduce your creative power. (Two of the Chapters on Unfeelingness of Old)

This year is the Year of the Ox. I hope that our 400 million compatriots will use the strength of an ox to pull our China into the realm of modern countries.

### Enemies Meet

Old moral concepts are, of course, the shackles of ethics and morality, but the so-called "new" men and women must pay close attention to the worship of new morality; otherwise, they will give superficial fashionists a path of only suicide!

So-called love is the cooperation of spirit and body, not limited to the physical. All people in the world have a conscience and reason. Once this conscience and reason has traces of sin, once it is stained with ugly blemishes, then any physical enjoyment will not be considered true love.

But there are very few people in the world with such strong reason, right?

Movie

### The Four Leads of "Borrowing a Wife"

— Nanjing Ying

### Paris Screens "Little Miss Marker"

"Little Miss Marker" Shirley Temple, tired of a rich life and eager for freedom and fun, the plot is lighthearted, and the performance is wonderful. Undoubtedly, it is Shirley's most proud new work, which is indeed unmatched by any of her previous leading roles. The Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre is using this film to celebrate the New Year. To avoid crowding, an additional show will be screened every morning at 10:30 AM from New Year's Day for three days.

### Amateur Thespians in the New Year

Performing at the Carlton in mid-January

Since the Shanghai Amateur Drama Association decided on the program for its third public performance, "The Power of Darkness" (original by Tolstoy, adapted by Ouyang Yuqian), Ostrovsky's "The Storm," and O'Casey's "The Plough and the Stars" (adapted by Shen Xiling and Song Yizhou), it has been actively rehearsing for more than a month. It has now been decided by the conference to hold a public performance at the Carlton Grand Theater in mid-January.

Most of the people participating in the amateur drama performance are directors and actors from various film companies. They are usually tied down by their duties and often cannot have enough time to work together. Now that the New Year holiday is approaching, they have decided to use this holiday to actively step up rehearsals. In addition to daily rehearsals, they will hold parties to increase interest.

### Hunting in Wenchuan

The famous hunter Yang Dilin, brother of the explorer Yang Dize, studied in the Americas and has been deep into the northeast, southeast, and other parts of Xikang many times, hunting many rare birds and strange animals. In late August of this year, he went from Shanghai to Chongqing, passing through Chengdu to Caopo in Wenchuan County. The area is full of mountains, about 7,000 feet above sea level. The purpose of this trip was to hunt the world-famous white bear. This white bear is different from the Arctic white bear, about three feet high and more than four feet long. The fur is black and white, and bamboo leaves, bamboo stalks, and bamboo shoots are its daily food. It is only produced in the border area of ​​Sichuan and Kang in my country, which is very precious. The local aborigines say that it can eat steel and respect it as a sacred beast, and dare not harm it, so it multiplies very well. In fact, the theory of eating iron is completely a false rumor. Mr. Yang harvested two heads on this trip, one of which was given to the Academia Sinica, and the other was made into a specimen and stored in his home. It is said that each head is worth about 2,000 US dollars.
