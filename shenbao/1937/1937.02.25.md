### Seeking Reality by Avoiding Names: Diplomacy Towards China

[Z Nan Yun >

The Core of the Hayashi Cabinet's Program

㊀

It so happened that the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Nanjing, China, and the 70th Japanese Diet, which had been adjourned three times and then reconvened, opened on the same day. We have not yet seen what resolutions were made at the Third Plenary Session regarding the issue of the survival of the Chinese nation, and there is no need to discuss it here. Although the 70th Japanese Diet is still in session today, records of various important discussions have already been seen. There is no doubt that, generally speaking, the central topic of the 70th Diet is the policy toward China.

Someone asked: In this Diet, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hayashi announced the government program, which included "Clarifying the National Essence," "Strengthening National Defense and Industry," "Seeking Stability in the People's Livelihoods," "Revising the Budget Somewhat and Suppressing Prices," and "Sweeping Away Misunderstandings with China (支那),” why can it be said that the policy toward China is the central issue of this Diet?

We can answer that there are special matters that cannot be included under the policy toward China, such as some Diet members questioning "infringements on human rights." But generally speaking, the central issue is indeed the policy toward China.

㊁

Why? Just looking at what Prime Minister Hayashi often says is enough to understand.——

"One of the policies of clarifying the National Essence is to realize stability in East Asia..." Needless to say, this so-called "East Asia" includes China. "Japan is the leading force in ensuring stability in East Asia." Today's Prime Minister Hayashi is the former commander of the Korean Army. During the "September 18th Incident," it was this Commander Hayashi who believed that the three northeastern provinces were not "stable," so he "unilaterally" sent the "Kamamura Brigade" into the northeastern provinces. This kind of "unilateral action" earned him the nickname of "General Crossing the Border." Will Prime Minister Hayashi consider China to be "stable" in the future? This is a big question, and a very obvious one. Therefore, under the policy of "realizing stability in East Asia," there will always be dramas staged.

The so-called "strengthening national defense" ostensibly seems to be competing with the Soviet Union and the United States, etc., but the actual situation is obvious without explanation. Speaking of "revitalizing industry," in addition to keeping the Japanese working masses busy, expanding markets and seizing resources are the most important activities. Prime Minister Hayashi mentions "national defense" and "industry" together, which is befitting of an army general who is also today's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. But where are the easiest resources to obtain, and where are the nearest and largest markets? This also does not need to be answered.

"Seeking stability in the people's livelihoods" -- what kind of people does this "people" refer to? Regardless of any statistical survey, everyone must admit that the lives of Japanese workers and farmers are now more difficult than at any previous time (a separate article will be written to detail the recent lives and struggles of Japanese laborers). The Japanese workers and farmers are the majority of the Japanese people, however, where in Prime Minister Hayashi's policy program is there any shadow of seeking stability in the lives of workers and farmers?

Are "budget revisions and price suppression" one of the policies for "seeking stability in the people's livelihoods"? The budget proposed by the previous cabinet was too large (3.04 billion yuan). Can the current cabinet's proposed "revision of 270 million yuan" be said to be a policy of "seeking stability in the people's livelihoods"? Moreover, the so-called "revision" is not really cutting 270 million yuan, but rather recording this 270 million yuan in next year's account (that is, recorded on the account of the people's burden). Next year, this debt will still have to be repaid. Repaid to whom? Repaid to the military and the Ministry of the Interior, etc. The purpose of this kind of bookkeeping-style budget revision is nothing more than to reduce the burden on a portion of the capitalists and slightly ease the resistance from the masses. -- In essence, the burden on the masses will only become heavier and heavier. Moreover, in this revised account, the amount that the army and navy can temporarily "defer" is only 46 million yuan.

How can such a budget revision "stabilize the people's livelihoods"? If it is said that stability is sought by "suppressing prices," what are the effective measures for "suppressing prices"? Can the Hayashi cabinet forcibly reduce the profits of capitalists? What supports the Hayashi cabinet? Regarding the speed of rising prices in Japan, according to a survey by the Bank of Japan, in January of this year, the Tokyo price index had risen to 181.3 (up 14.6 from December of last year and up 22.8 from January of last year), but in London it only rose to 122.3 (up 2.6 from December of last year and up 14.6 from January of last year), and in New York it only rose to 129.0 (up 2.0 from December of last year and up 13.9 from January of last year).

With prices soaring like this, if the Hayashi cabinet does not advocate "suppression," then it will naturally become a target of attack. However, in Japan today, where exports are devalued, imports are mainly military supplies, and peace is also based on the military industry, how is it possible to overcome rising prices? Even if the magic weapon of "strengthening price controls" is brought out, those who will be sacrificed will only be a portion of the capitalists with weaker capital. It will be even more beneficial to Mitsui and Mitsubishi, which have already maintained monopoly prices. In the end, it is still the masses who are unstable.

From the above general analysis, it can be summarized as: Under the policy of realizing stability in East Asia (i.e., completing the continental policy), expand armaments and revitalize industry -- this is the Hayashi cabinet's program. In other words, it is: Under the policy toward China, expand armaments and revitalize industry.

### To Bailingmiao (4)

— Our reporter Qian Hua

Let the ancient grasslands be hundreds of miles without inhabitants - The life of officers and soldiers on the icy and snowy frontier beyond the Great Wall

㊄

Freezing So Cold It Makes Your Skin Jump

Naturally, a well-equipped, heated office like the head of the special agency is the priority of the women. Our temporary accommodation was in a company headquarters two alleys away, in two small rooms, one-third of which was a brick kang covered with a thin layer of felt. There was a broken leather furnace in the room, burning cow dung. According to the soldiers, "In Bailingmiao, transportation is inconvenient, and there is a great panic about coal and food, especially coal, which is more precious than gold. The fuel normally used is cow and horse dung. Every day, we brothers go out and always pick up one or two hemp bags, so that everyone can keep warm, and it is even more indispensable for boiling water and cooking. The dung here burns easily, and its volatility is also high, but it is not lasting. There must be a person who continues to serve the fire constantly, otherwise, after ten minutes, the raging fire will cover the flag and die out." At this time, we had just experienced the cold, and seeing the fire was already incredibly intimate. We only felt that the smell of the dung was clear and fragrant, and we were very happy to chat with the soldiers who were serving us. After a day of laboring on the car, we were drowsy at nine o'clock, but looking at the brick kang, there was still nothing, the kang was cold, and a cold air was rising straight up, and the four walls were humid, as if entering a mountain cave in summer, which was terrible to the touch. The soldier also said: "We brothers only have this set of clothes, and we use the old sheepskin coat as a big quilt at night, and wear it during the day to keep out the cold. You distinguished guests from afar will also have to make do with it." At this time, there was still fire, so I bravely replied to them: "That's not a problem. If you can endure hardship, can't we endure one or two nights?" So the reporter also took off his leather coat, covered it on his body, used a small mirror box as a pillow, and put on a pair of galoshes on his feet, and went to bed with his clothes on. Soon, the soldiers left, the fire went out, and the cold air invaded in gusts, first from the feet, gradually cooling to the chest, and the heart was frozen to jump, shaking all over, and quickly wrapped the leather coat tightly around the head, it was really impossible to sleep on either side. Finally, it was hard to wait until the fifth watch, and the soldier ran in in the dim morning light, and quickly asked them to make dung fire, and finally survived the difficult night. It is said that the temperature in Bailingmiao in the early morning and evening is about 40 degrees below zero. In recent years, it can increase to about 20 degrees below zero. In the winter before last year, the snow on the ground was four or five feet deep, and the climate was cold to 45 degrees below zero, and many livestock and people were frozen to death.

The Calamity of the Joyful Buddha

Bailingmiao is commonly known as Bailing Temple. When Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty pacified Outer Mongolia and the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, he stationed troops here and built a Lama temple, so it was initially called Belle Temple. The surrounding area is undulating hills, a total of nine, like a city, and the Bailing River runs through it. Surrounded by mountains, there are large openings to the north and south, all of which can pass vehicles. There are seven small items on the east and west hills, the terrain of nine dragons spitting water, commonly known as the Jiulongkou, which is more dangerous than the Jiunmenkou of the Great Wall. The reporter spent a day touring around. From the many Lama temples in Hexi to the streets in Hedong, and then walking up the mountain, overlooking the panorama, because the slope is gentle, it is not too tiring to run up in one breath. There are sentinel posts on the top of the mountain, and the defensive fortifications are extremely tight. As far as the national defense front line of Bailingmiao is concerned, it is really special and fearful. Bailingmiao is a general term. There are more than a dozen large and small Lama temples in this circle, all of which are magnificent and rich. However, there are many bullet holes on the outer walls, and some whole blocks are missing a corner. Defensive objects such as sandbags are still piled there. The garrison puts a few small steel cannons at the missing openings, which is very mighty. These are all achievements left over from fierce battles. The carvings and paintings in the temple are very exquisite, and the golden statues of Buddha are even more solemn. Although after the war, all objects are messy and incomplete, the outline structure has not changed much. Strange gods are painted on the four walls of the main hall, especially the most incredible thing is that a woman is painted in various obscene states under the Cow King. The last hall enshrines the Joyful Buddha, but the number is unequal. The Joyful Buddha is the most sacred and inviolable Buddha statue in the Lama temple. Except for Mongolian princes and nobles, no one is allowed to enter this hall without permission. Even the princes and nobles can only enter for worship on certain days. The Yonghe Temple in Beiping also enshrines the Joyful Buddha. On the eve of the emperor's wedding, the Lama led him to the inner hall, respectfully unveiled the red cloth covering the lower part of the Joyful Buddha, and asked the emperor to visit. After the Republic of China, tourists to Yonghe Temple can also enjoy the same rights as the emperor by spending a few yuan of legal tender. There are especially many Joyful Buddhas in Bailingmiao. There are more than a dozen large and small ones in one hall. There are all kinds of obscene postures, and in terms of shape and meaning, it is indeed an insult to women in the new era, because joy is mutual, and the women portrayed in the statues are all bloody or terrified and howling. This is nothing more than showing the supreme authority of men in those years. This idea is too outdated. It is said that when the National Army attacked Bailingmiao, they all believed that such mysterious Joyful Buddha statues were out of line with the trend, so they beat them up, and the Buddha statues had broken heads, broken arms, and incomplete bodies. Only one or two out of ten were intact. It was really a great calamity for the Joyful Buddha! (To be continued)

Current Commentary

### Hopes for the Effectiveness of Economic Construction

— Liu

The declaration of this Third Plenary Session, on the issue of economic construction, elaborated in many ways. It roughly stated that "The progress of national unification must be based on economic unification to be truly successful. And at a time of national salvation and survival, the growth of national strength depends even more on the enrichment of the people's strength. Economic construction is indeed an important plan at present. For the sake of thinking about future troubles and preventing them, we should engage in equalizing land rights and controlling capital. For the sake of increasing production, we should engage in developing state capital, while at the same time giving appropriate protection to private capital... All measures should be sought to suit the needs of national defense and the people's livelihood, and especially must adhere to the principles of the People's Livelihood, so that social interests are mutually harmonized and equally developed, so as to lead to the realm of common ownership, common governance, and common enjoyment. We will never tolerate the fallacy of class struggle, so as to cause social disturbance, nor will we create the genus of unequal wealth and poverty, so as to leave future disputes behind." The above remarks are truly fundamental arguments. If we follow this path, economic construction will surely have tangible results in a few years.

In recent years, the clamor for economic construction has not been low. However, in reality, it is often nothing more than empty talk. As for the so-called talents, I dare not falsely accuse them, but in reality there are many "scholars of articles and speeches." Therefore, there are not few "experts," but the progress of the cause is not much. Destruction is not unviolent, but the work of construction is limited. This is why the people have repeatedly not enjoyed the benefits of construction, but have suffered the burden of construction first. In terms of industry and commerce, the foundation is not established, and the skills are low, far from being able to reach the level of advanced countries. However, the theory of surplus and the view of class have long been deeply rooted in people's hearts. When disputes come, there is always no place for weighing the situation and considering reason, so that those with capital dare not contribute their capital, and those with labor have no way to exert their strength. Not only is the road to business farther and farther, but the panic of unemployment is also deeper and deeper. At present, the exhaustion and stagnation of industry and commerce has many causes, but this is also one of them.

In the future, the direction of economic construction and the measures to be taken have already been revealed by the Third Plenary Session. There is no need to repeat them. However, what we hope for is that, speaking urgently, we should focus on the construction of national defense economy. Tracing its root, it is not just from the perspective of the interests of the whole people, but must suit the needs of the people's livelihood to engage in construction. Therefore, construction should be vigorous, but also avoid acting hastily. The vision should be far-reaching, but we must not forget the reality. In short, all construction projects should be weighed between urgency, size, and timing in order to determine the order of implementation. Only in this way can construction achieve the effect of "seeking truth from facts."

As for the revival of industry and commerce, it is necessary to improve the knowledge and skills in operation and organization as the main plan. The industry and commerce of the past lacked this kind of spirit and ability, so that they could not resist the economic forces from outside. The accumulated habits of "worshiping the foreign and belittling the Chinese," and the inability to fully exercise tax administration are also diseases in the heart of our industry and commerce. Now that the inland handicraft industry has been defeated, only a small number of light industries remain, which are extremely fragile and cannot withstand a single blow from foreign forces. The technology of agricultural production still has not changed from the old methods of thousands of years ago. The abundance or scarcity of the harvest depends entirely on the heavens. There is no thought of using human power to avoid disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect pests. This is because they do not know what science is, and have not been able to apply science to agriculture. Today, if agriculture, industry, and commerce want to progress and be safe, they must do their best to achieve the two major goals of "agricultural scientization" and "industrial ruralization." This is also the essence of economic construction.

### Chief of Staff of Kwantung Army, Itagaki, Transferred to Division Commander

Vacancy to be Succeeded by Tojo Hideki; Isoya Also Commander of the 10th Division

[Tokyo] Among the personnel changes in the army announced today, March 1st, the most noteworthy point is the transfer of Itagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, to commander of the 5th Division in Hiroshima City. The vacancy will be filled by Tojo Hideki, the current commander of the Kwantung Army Military Police. Tojo is highly praised by Prime Minister Hayashi and is a person of great courage in the Japanese army. His views are also roughly the same as Hayashi's. Moreover, with Tojo taking the position of Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, the central organization governing the Kwantung Army may be able to effectively exercise its authority to some extent in the future, and changes in the future direction of the Kwantung Army are also more likely. In addition, Isoya Renzo, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, has been transferred to commander of the 10th Division. The vacant position of Director of the Military Affairs Bureau will be filled by Kogu. Ishihara has been promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as Director of the 1st Department of the General Staff Headquarters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)

[Tokyo] Regarding the regular army reshuffle implemented from March 1st, the number of promotions for major personnel has been internally decided to be 900, and the number of transfers to be 1,800. This is an unprecedentedly large reshuffle. A brief list is as follows:

### Britain Actively Prepares for Wartime and Strengthens Air Defense

Auxiliary Firefighting Organizations Established Throughout the Country, 200,000 Firefighters Trained

[London] Britain is actively preparing for emergency times, and now there is one more clarification, that is, according to the latest report, auxiliary firefighting organizations will be established throughout Britain. The purpose is to resist the arson of incendiary bombs in the event of an air raid. It is said that the new organization requires 200,000 personnel, and each person needs three months of training to become an effective firefighter. The minimum number of personnel recruited for this plan is 100,000, because a large bomber can carry ten small incendiary bombs. If the air is gained, then the city of London alone needs at least 20,000 firefighters. Each of these firefighters should be given equipment expenses of £5 and an additional £3. Auxiliary fire brigades will be established throughout the country, powerful firefighting equipment will be added, and patrol teams will be organized, so that women can also join in some kind of service.

The above plan was announced by Home Secretary Simon in the House of Commons today. It includes a large amount of storage of firefighting equipment for emergency times in peacetime, such as high-power jet machines, fire-fighting trailers, belts, etc. Temporary firefighting teams, patrol teams, and fire stations should also be organized in advance, so that each street is under constant attention, and in the event of a fire, it can be put out at any time, so as not to spread into a disaster. Therefore, in peacetime, the majority of the people must be properly trained so that they can join the full-time or part-time firefighting work in emergency times.

The current government is considering the local authorities' presentation of all the expenses for the necessary firefighting equipment and firefighting teams in emergency times. After the government decides in the future, it will allocate corresponding firefighting machinery, belts, and other equipment according to the needs of various places and the approved defense plans of various places. As for the initial training of this auxiliary firefighting organization and equipment expenses, as well as future budgets, etc., they will be subsidized by the government. The existing local firefighting organizations should still exist, but what is being prepared is the organization between regions, and local authorities should cooperate with it.

### French Foreign Minister Explains Diplomatic Policy

Promote European Peace, Senate Trusts the Government

[Paris] The Senate met this afternoon to discuss the government's foreign policy. As a result, by a large majority of 213 votes to 1, it passed a motion of confidence in the government. During the discussion, most senators raised questions on various issues such as the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, the situation in Spain, the domestic war of volunteers from various countries, and the relations between France and Italy. Foreign Minister Daladier replied to each item. The Foreign Minister said, "Any country can join the treaties that France has signed with other countries. France will definitely abide by this kind of treaty system. At the same time, France is ready to participate in any negotiations that can promote European peace. In short, the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, the agreements signed between France and the countries of the Little Entente, and the alliance with Poland are all extremely strong." Referring to the issue of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, he said that the method of non-interference was first advocated by France. The government now has the determination to recall all French volunteers who are currently fighting in Spain, but on the condition that other countries do the same. Referring to the relations between Britain and France, he said that the situation is very good. "In addition, our relationship with the United States and its President Roosevelt is also very close because we have common ideals. This level should also have infinite value for world peace." Referring to France's relations with Germany, he said, "Since Germany has made a statement of peace, it is deeply hoped that it will not continue with the proposal to expand armaments. If so, the relations between France and Germany can be improved more easily." Finally, referring to the recent Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement signed between Britain and Italy, he said that this agreement also protects France's interests in the Mediterranean.

### Supreme Council of the Fascist Party

Regarding the Current Diplomatic Situation, Ciano Will Present a Report

[Rome] The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party is scheduled to meet next Monday. The most important matter at this meeting will be the Foreign Minister Ciano's diplomatic report. According to well-informed sources, Ciano intends to present a lengthy report at the meeting to elaborate on various important diplomatic issues. To name a few, one is that the United States has adopted a huge armament policy, which has affected the naval situation of Italy in the Mediterranean. The second is that after the recent visit of the German Foreign Minister to the Austrian authorities, there will be new developments in the relations between Germany, Austria, and Italy. The Austrian Prime Minister is scheduled to visit Italy at the end of March, which is not far away, and preparations should be made in advance. The third is that the relationship between Italy and the countries of the Little Entente should be re-examined. In addition, the Secretary-General of the Fascist Party will report on the increase in the number of party members at the meeting, and the Minister of Education will report on the continued decline in the birth rate in Italy.

### Ethiopian Emperor Invited to Attend British King's Coronation

Rome Believes British Action Violates Spirit of Mediterranean Agreement

[London] The British King is scheduled to hold his coronation ceremony on May 12th. The Ethiopian Embassy in London has confirmed that the British government has invited the Emperor of Abyssinia to attend this grand event. (Havas, 24th)

[Rome] According to a statement released by the Abyssinian Embassy, former Emperor Haile Selassie will send a representative to attend the coronation of the British King instead of personally attending. This matter has recently attracted considerable attention. It is understood that the Italian side has informally expressed that if the former Emperor of Abyssinia and his small remaining faction still participate in the ceremony under the name of "Emperor of Abyssinia," it will be impossible for Italy to send a representative to participate. The Italian side also believes that the British invitation to Selassie is inconsistent with the spirit of the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement. However, if the British side does not change its predetermined arrangements, Italy will be represented by Prince and Princess di Piemonte to attend the ceremony. However, whether they will come to England is not yet officially indicated here. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 24th)

[Rome] Political figures here declare that if the British government does invite the Ethiopian Emperor to attend the coronation of the British King, the tense relationship between Britain and Italy will inevitably be reignited. The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party may discuss this issue at length when it meets on March 1st. In addition, Britain's large-scale military expansion plan has also caused great concern among political figures here, and it may be studied together at that time. (Havas, 24th)

### Former Ethiopian Emperor's Advisor, Colson, Dies in the United States

[Washington] Mr. Colson, an American who once served as an advisor to the Ethiopian Emperor, passed away in Washington today. Although Colson did not stand out during his tenure in Abyssinia, his role was extremely important during the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. Most of the documents sent by the Ethiopian Emperor to the great powers and the League of Nations were written by Colson. These documents were known for their solemn wording and skillful arguments, which were the biggest reason why the world expressed sympathy for the Ethiopian Emperor. In addition, Colson was also responsible for Ethiopia's external propaganda. Journalists from various countries who covered the Ethiopian war were able to attest to Colson's outstanding talent.

### End of German-Austrian Talks

Communiqué Only Mentions Commonplace Events; Foreign Minister Neurath Returns to Berlin

[Vienna] German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit here has concluded, and he departed for his country in the evening. The official communiqué on the talks between Neurath and Prime Minister Schuschnigg has been released, stating only that Germany and Austria share completely identical views on maintaining European peace. It also stated that the agreement signed by the two countries on July 11th of last year contains various provisions that are an appropriate basis for restoring friendly and sincere relations between the two countries, and that the economic agreement signed by the two countries on January 27th of this year is also sufficient to promote the development of mutual economic relations between the two countries. All of this is satisfactory to Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Neurath. The communiqué concludes by stating that the two countries will establish a special committee to deal with various issues related to cultural relations between the two countries. (Havas, 23rd)

[Vienna] After completing discussions with Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg today, German Foreign Minister Neurath departed for Berlin. The Austrian government issued a communiqué on the discussions between the two politicians, only mentioning commonplace events. This proves that there were no major decisions made during the talks. Although the authorities deny Neurath's proposal that Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary conclude a defense agreement, external sources continue to assert it, and say that Schuschnigg's visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in March will take this as the main topic of discussion. According to political circles, Austria cannot even give preliminary approval to this matter without Mussolini's full consent. At the same time, Schuschnigg has not made any concessions on the issue of Austrian restoration, while Germany is strongly opposed to this move. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 23rd)

[Vienna] Neurath issued a statement to the Austrian official news agency, claiming that his two-day stay in Austria should be regarded as a natural result of the racial relationship between Germany and Austria, and should not be regarded as an action with political significance. Before departing for his country, Neurath also issued a statement to the Italian official news agency, declaring that increased understanding between Germany and Austria can assist Hitler and Mussolini's peace policies. (National Telegram, 23rd)

[London] Regarding German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria, The Times recently published a message from its Vienna correspondent, stating that Neurath's trip discussed neither the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg royal family nor the issue of German annexation, but rather the issue of the annexation of Czechoslovakia. It is said that German Aviation Minister Göring has just returned to his country from a meeting in Poland. The Czech government and the German minority in its territory are also currently conducting negotiations, and Neurath's visit to Austria at this time is of particular significance, as Czechoslovakia is geographically located between Austria and Poland. The newspaper concludes, "Germany's offensive on the colonial issue has now failed. It is not impossible for it to throw another bomb in Europe or expand outward." (Havas, 24th)

[Paris] Newspapers here continue to comment on the Austrian issue. Among them, Mrs. Tabouis, a diplomatic reporter for the L'œuvre newspaper, declared, "It is generally believed that the Austrian Prime Minister is prepared to make a last-ditch effort against National Socialism and clearly propose a principle to European countries, that countries have only two paths to follow: either allow Germany and Austria to merge, or directly restore the Austrian monarchy." Mrs. Tabouis also stated that the claim that Germany and Italy have already reached a certain agreement on the Austrian issue has recently become very strong. The same news is also published in "Le Populaire", stating, "Some people believe that an agreement has been reached between Germany and Italy, stipulating that Germany can act freely within the territory of Czechoslovakia, but on the condition of abandoning the plan to merge Germany and Austria." L'Humanité, the Communist Party newspaper, said, "Hitler and Mussolini have almost agreed to divide spheres of influence in the Balkan Peninsula and completely destroy the collective security organization of the Balkan countries." Le Temps also said, "The recent visit of the German Foreign Minister to Austria has not only failed to change the current uneasy situation, but has also exacerbated it." (Havas, 24th)

### Poland Delineates Border Security Zone

Free Residence Restricted Within Thirty Kilometers

Warsaw: Within thirty kilometers of the Polish border, no one is allowed to reside in the area without special permission from the authorities. This is one of the latest laws promulgated by Poland to protect its territory. In the future, Polish citizens who wish to reside within this area must prove that they have lived there for at least six months and must obtain a special permit from the local county magistrate to be valid. In addition, a zone of two to six kilometers is delineated along the border, and no one within it is allowed to possess telephones, radios, or homing pigeons. (National Telegram, 23rd)

### Patriotic Groups Donate Aircraft to Government

Warsaw: According to reports from here, various patriotic groups have donated large sums of money to build aircraft and will donate more than 150 aircraft to the Polish Air Force on "Armed Forces Day" on August 15th. It is also said that employees of savings banks in various places have donated funds to build a second aviation school. (National Telegram, 24th)

### 19th Anniversary of the Soviet Red Army

Vorošilov Issues Instructions

[Moscow] Today, the entire Soviet Union celebrates the 19th anniversary of the Red Army. Marshal Vorošilov, the People's Commissar for Defense, issued special instructions, stating, "The socialist victories recorded in the Stalinist Constitution have made our country, in one-sixth of the world's land, a prosperous homeland for socialist builders. Under the love and protection of the Soviet Union, the Red Army will repel any attack and wipe out any enemy who attempts to disturb the peaceful labor, happy life, and property of our people."

### Maritime Monitoring of Spain Divided Among Countries

Effective from Next Month, the 6th; Soviet Union Has Not Finally Agreed

[London] The Non-Intervention Committee on the control of arms entering Spain during the Spanish Civil War has now passed the distribution plan for maritime monitoring of the Spanish coast. The northern coast will be the responsibility of Britain and Portugal, the northwest coast will be the responsibility of France and the Soviet Union, the southern coast from the Spanish-Portuguese border to Almería will be the responsibility of Britain, and from Almería to the Spanish-French border will be the responsibility of Germany and Italy. In addition, France will monitor the islands of Ibiza and Majorca, Italy will monitor the island of Minorca, France will monitor Spanish Morocco, and Britain will monitor the Canary Islands and Livorno. The Soviet Union has not yet given final acceptance to the area it has been allocated. Because its closest naval base is the Black Sea, the Soviet Union is willing to defend the eastern coast of Spain, but the area it has been temporarily allocated includes a part of the Bay of Biscay, and the Soviet Union has little interest in stationing troops there. It is also stipulated that the monitoring ships of each country should patrol within ten miles of the Spanish coast and are assumed to have the right to board and inspect any ships approaching the Spanish coast. This plan and the land control measures will take effect simultaneously on March 6th. The cost of British warship patrols will be paid by the British government. According to reliable estimates, the British government will also have to pay £100,000 annually for land patrol costs, which is about 16% of the total cost. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 24th)

[Paris] Famous aviators Denys and Libeert departed from the Vélizy-Villacoublay airfield here at 10:05:34 last night, flying a "Caudron Simoun" aircraft to Tokyo, Japan, attempting to complete the entire journey in less than 100 hours to win the 400,000 franc prize set by the Ministry of Aviation.

Later, aviators Dollé and Micheletti departed again in January of this year, but were forced to land on an island in the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam.

### Raw Materials Allocation Conference

Germany's Reasons for Not Participating

[Berlin] Political circles here say that Germany's decision to refuse to participate in the Geneva Raw Materials Conference is not surprising, because this attitude is fully in line with Germany's policy on the colonial issue. However, it is also very clear that Germany is closely watching the development of the conference. Diplomatic circles here criticize the way Geneva handles problems, with endless debates and a large number of statistics but no practical results. Moreover, Geneva is still linked to the Treaty of Versailles, which inevitably discriminates against Germany. (National Telegram, 23rd)

### Gan Security Corps Implements Land Reclamation

Starting with Planting Tung Trees

Nanchang Dispatch: Since the pacification of bandits in Jiangxi Province, the newly recovered areas require local security forces to maintain order. Therefore, the security corps have been expanding daily, now reaching over twenty regiments. However, due to the devastation after the banditry, the countryside is riddled with problems, making it difficult to bear the cost of the corps. Therefore, the Security Bureau has decided to implement land reclamation by the corps, turning soldiers into producers to reduce the burden on the people. The reclamation policy starts with planting tung trees. The needed land will be public or unclaimed barren mountains. Large-scale reclamation areas will first be opened up along the Nanchang-Xunyang, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Jiangxi-Hunan, Jiangxi-Austria, and Jiangxi-Fujian transportation lines as models, and then gradually expanded. Now that spring has arrived, and it is the time for planting trees, the Security Bureau has purchased a large number of tung tree seedlings, along with printed "Guidelines for Planting Tung Trees," and ordered the security commanders of each district and the heads of each security corps to engage in planting tung trees on designated barren mountains and wasteland for those non-district corps and those not included in the bandit suppression combat sequence. After the tung oil trees have achieved success, then consider grains and animal husbandry.

Stolen goods such as burlap sacks, clothing, and copper-tin utensils were found. According to their confession, there were other accomplices hiding in the Huang Shuntai cigarette paper shop in Caojiadu, Shanghai. However, Gong Kunshu claimed to be a ticket seller at the Xiyuan Amusement Park and denied being a thief. Captain Fei recalled that the previous night, a felt hat with a postcard inside, bearing an address matching the address provided by Shi and others, was left behind by thieves at the home of Ni Erlin in Chongwen Street in the city. He then led detectives Gu Lansheng and Tang Shuqin to Shanghai and, together with the Caojiadu police station, dispatched police to assist in arresting five thieves, Chen Asan, Chen Alian, Zhang Ahe, Yin Amai, and Tao Ahe, at the address. The Shanghai police took them to the station for temporary detention. Captain Fei returned to Songjiang on the evening train and reported to the police chief to prepare a document to send the captain back to Shanghai on the 24th to bring them back for interrogation.

Since the snowfall on the first day of the lunar new year in Yangzhou City, the weather has changed from warm to cold, and after only two sunny days, it has been cloudy and rainy again for nearly ten days without a single clear day. The roads are muddy. The Yangzhou Lantern Market, which has a long-standing reputation, usually generates over 20,000 yuan in business, but this year the total sales are less than 3,000 yuan.

On the 23rd, in the midst of cloudy and rainy weather, small hailstones the size of beans suddenly fell at about 1 pm, the finer ones like pearls, and lasted for two hours before stopping.

### Shaoxing

Ministry Officials Inspect Bridge Construction

Of the bridges built on the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway passing through the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan area, except for the four bridges of Ruanshe, Qiaoqi, Chang'an, and Dengyun, the remaining seventy-one bridges were built with reduced labor and materials and were not constructed according to the river courses. As a result, the original river channels have become curved and unable to drain smoothly. In the future, if there is a flood, it will easily become a major disaster. Various legal groups have submitted requests to the provincial and central governments for relief regarding the damage to farmland and water conservancy. Now, the case has been delegated by the Ministry of Railways to Division Chief Sa Fujun to come to Shaoxing, accompanied by Cao Duan, the director of engineering, Zhang Haiping, and Dong Kaizhang, the engineer of the Shaoshan Duan Tangzha project, to inspect various locations and find ways to improve the situation.

### Private Schools in the First Special District Petition Regarding the Concession's Subsidy Fees

▲ Petitioned the Municipal Government and Other Agencies Yesterday

Private schools in the First Special District of this city, citing the encroachment of the Concession on educational administrative power regarding subsidy fees, and deliberate fault-finding, have previously collectively opposed this issue.

The presidium included Cui Jianji, Feng Yixian, Zhang Lingfei, Zhang Tianbai, and Tang Zengyang. Jin Yuezhang was the recorder, and Wang Baoxi, Ge Youren, Qi Yiying, and Feng Dafu were the hosts. First, the chairman reported on the recent association affairs, stating that members of the association now account for nine-tenths of the private schools in the district. All the previously decided matters have been carried out separately. However, various schools have successively received notices from the Concession stating that if they do not comply with its regulations, they will be ordered to demolish the schools within a certain period. There have been no fewer than 50 or 60 such cases. The entire meeting unanimously expressed their indignation and decided to immediately petition various Party and government agencies. At that time, it was raining heavily, but all the representatives were full of energy. Led by Weng Guoxun, and with Zhang Lingfei as the disciplinarian, they first went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where they were received by Zhou Funong, the director of the Civil Training Section. He expressed sympathy for the various points of the petition. They then went to the Municipal Government, where Mayor Wu sent Secretary Hang to receive them, promising to forward the petition. Next, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau, where Director Pan sent Section Chief Jiang to receive them. Regarding the encroachment on educational administrative power, which concerns sovereignty, they would naturally argue on principle. They would separately find ways to negotiate on all the points of the petition, striving for a satisfactory result. The representatives were satisfied. Finally, they went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, where Secretary Tao Ledong received them and gave a detailed report on the Concession's subsidy fees. He also expressed his willingness to argue on principle. The representatives left with excitement.

### Zhou Bangdao Discusses His Impressions of Inspecting Education in Shaanxi and Gansu

▲ Gansu Education Gradually Returning to Its Former State ▲ Sat Idle in Lanzhou for Seventy Days

The Ministry of Education previously sent Supervisor Zhou Bangdao to inspect education in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Coincidentally, he was in Xi'an during the incident and was stranded in Lanzhou. He waited for air traffic to resume before returning to Beijing a few days ago. In a recent interview with the Ministry of Education, he summarized the matters related to education that could be recorded, as follows: Zhou inspected the education administration and schools in various parts of Shaanxi and Gansu for more than ten days. When he arrived in Lanzhou, it coincided with the incident of November 12th. Zhou could not leave the bathing place even one step during his leisure time. However, he heard the sound of gunfire and bullets outside the door of the bathing place. After one night, at eight or nine o'clock the next morning, Zhou went out and returned to the Lishi Club, but could not enter. After many twists and turns, he temporarily lived in the state-run Guanzhou Women's Vocational School. Living in the school was relatively peaceful and undisturbed. However, because of the blocked transportation, he could not see the news from the southern newspapers and did not know any news, which was very depressing. Zhou sat idle and bored in Lanzhou for seventy days. As a result, his spirit and body have been affected, with discomfort such as chest tightness and dizziness. It is estimated that he can recover his original state after a short period of rest. It is also reported that when Zhou was inspecting in Xi'an, he felt that the local academic atmosphere was not good. The former Director of Education, Zhou Xuechang, failed to turn the tide and has already resigned. The provincial government has been reorganized and has appointed Zhou Bomin to succeed him. It is hoped that the new appointee will uphold the central government's educational objectives and rectify the academic atmosphere, and the future can be improved. Gansu was only indirectly affected by this incident, and the impact was small. Now the schools have gradually returned to their former state, and the Director of the Provincial Department of Education, Tian Jiongjin, has been in office for many years and has a good leadership role in education administration.

The Provincial New Life Movement Association recently received a notice from the General Association, stating that in order to promote student labor service that is practical and relevant to life, and to promote efficiency in the new life of various primary and secondary schools, a method for launching a school road and school garden building movement has been specially formulated and issued to local education authorities for unified and earnest implementation. It is reported that after receiving the document, the association will issue a notice to schools at all levels within days to promote the movement. The original text of the method is recorded as follows: ㊀ Among the labor services of the school, building school roads and school gardens can best demonstrate the spirit of service. It can facilitate transportation, assist in construction, beautify the environment, and get close to nature, which has a great impact on students' practical life. ㊁ For building roads, surveying and determining the route, whether the road to be opened is inside or outside the school, should be considered in many ways in advance to determine which route is appropriate. If necessary, consult with the local public works and technical institutions to repair and open up the original route as the principle. Prepare materials according to the nature of the road to be built, prepare various needed materials such as cement, stones, soil, ash, sand, etc. The materials used for building roads outside the school can be supplied by the local public works agency. Prepare staff, teachers, students, and workers to participate in the labor. It can also be organized into groups according to the number of people and competitions can be held. Appoint local engineering institutions and students or workers with experience in civil engineering as technical instructors. The time should be after 4 pm every day and Saturday afternoon, so as not to hinder internal classes. Judge the spirit, order, and solidity of the road building by each school, and send personnel from the local New Life Movement Association and the public works agency to conduct inspections and evaluate the merits and demerits for awards. ㊂ For gardening, select a location and use vacant and abandoned land inside or outside the school as a school garden. Once the location is selected, design and start construction, prepare tools, prepare various tools to be used, as well as flowers, grass, and seedlings to be planted. Allocate labor. Teachers, students, and workers should all participate in the labor. The time is the same as road construction, so as not to hinder internal classes. After planting, select people with rich interests and experience among students and teachers to be responsible for management, guidance, distribution, and regular irrigation and cultivation. Organize the school garden, (add some organization to the original one) The organizing work should include weeding, pruning, transplanting, fertilizing, and repairing garden paths and drainage ditches, and should be organized properly according to the season and climate. The organizing time should be mobilized at any time as needed according to the situation. Those familiar with gardening should be responsible for technical guidance. ㊃ Schools at all levels across the country should widely launch the two tasks of road construction and gardening. The standards to be achieved by the end of the 26th year [of the Republic] are: 1. In terms of road construction, each school should be able to complete the roads outside and inside its school gate. 2. In terms of gardening and organizing the school garden, each school should be able to complete one. ㊄ The local New Life Movement Association and education administrative agencies are responsible for supervising and inspecting this work.

### Preparatory Plan for the Seventh National Games

▲The selection of members of the organizing committee has been largely determined, and gliding will be added as a sport. ▲It is also planned to hold an exhibition of domestic sports equipment and publications for youth.

(Special dispatch from Nanjing) The Seventh National Games should be held in the capital during the Double Ten Festival of this year, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's announced measures for holding the National Games. Seeing that the preparations for previous National Games were rushed, resulting in them not being as satisfactory as desired, the Ministry of Education began preparing for this National Games early. In January, the Ministry approved the preparatory plan for this National Games and solicited opinions from various relevant parties regarding the selection of members for the organizing committee. The current status of preparations for this National Games, as learned from inquiries, is roughly described as follows:

㊀ The selection of members of the organizing committee has been largely determined, and after submitting them to the Minister of Education for final approval, letters of appointment will be sent separately.

㊁ The organizational structure of the organizing committee will still follow the model of the fifth and sixth games. The organizing committee will have several standing committee members and two committees for review and competition, as well as a chief and deputy secretary. Under the competition committee, there will be six groups for venue allocation, martial arts judging, record-keeping, and prizes. Under the chief and deputy secretaries, there will be groups for affairs, accounting, documents, transportation, security, reception, health, and publicity.

㊂ Regarding the competition rules, the competition rules of the previous National Games will still be applied, but in order to encourage more people to participate in sports, the competition time will be slightly reduced to allow for the addition of group exercises and model teaching programs.

㊃ It is heard that the budget for the games will be handled in the same way as the fifth games, but because the activities of this games have increased, the budget is slightly higher than the fifth games (the budget for the fifth games was over 130,000 yuan). It is heard that the budget proposal has been prepared and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review by the Ministry of Education in the coming days, after which the Ministry of Finance will allocate the funds.

㊄ In order to increase interest in aviation and actively cultivate aviation talents, this National Games plans to universally promote gliding. It is heard that the Central Aviation School has already manufactured a glider, and a gliding expert who has just returned from Germany will come to the meeting to perform.

㊅ It has been decided to hold an exhibition of domestic sports equipment, scouting supplies, and sports publications during the games to increase the general public's interest in sports from various aspects. However, whether this exhibition can be held as scheduled still requires the consent of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.

### Pinghan Railway Football Team Scheduled to Play against Lyceum

▲Sunday afternoon at Shen Garden

After the Wuhan Pinghan Railway football team arrived in Shanghai for an expedition, the competition schedule has been slow to be determined. This is because the Shanghai Chinese and Western teams have mostly gone to Hong Kong for inter-port competitions. Although the Western inter-port team returned to Shanghai a few days ago, the Chinese team will also arrive in Shanghai today. However, Western football leagues have been suspended for a long time and are about to end. Therefore, the Western teams have matches every week and have little time to spare. Moreover, all teams except the Lyceum military team have their own jobs and are not willing to be too tired. Therefore, although the team has entrusted the Sports Association to arrange the competition, it is feared that a satisfactory result will be difficult to achieve. Currently, in addition to the scheduled match against Lyceum at Shen Garden at 3:00 PM on Sunday, the French team hopes to win the Western League Division A championship, and there are still many games left, so it is feared that they cannot make the appointment. As for the Chinese team, it depends on the return of the Shanghai Chinese team today.

### Liang Hejun Discusses Capital and Deposit Income Tax Filing

Simple Procedures, Hoping to Comply with the Deadline - Deadline Set by the Ministry, Difficult to Extend Again

The Shanghai Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance is collecting various types of income tax. The deadline for companies and businesses in the city to file their capital and deposit information is the end of this month. Failure to file by the deadline will be considered concealment and will be subject to penalties. As the deadline is approaching, the office has issued a notice urging people to file, and many people have been filing with the office in recent days. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Liang Hejun, the director of the Shanghai Income Tax Office, and asked if the deadline would be extended again. Mr. Liang replied that the deadline for profit-making businesses to file their capital amount was originally limited to the end of January of this year, but at the request of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, it was submitted to the Ministry and approved for a one-month extension. The deadline for filing the deposit information of businesses has also been limited to the end of February. Now that the deadline has arrived, the office has not only published notices urging people to file, but also sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to convene trade associations to urge their members to file separately. As for whether the deadline can be extended again, the office has not received instructions from the Ministry and cannot answer. However, according to the office's view, the income tax implementation rules originally stipulated only one month for filing. If it is extended again after already being extended for one month, the Ministry may find it difficult to approve. Therefore, I hope that the business community will still comply with the deadline. Moreover, the filing procedure is very simple, requiring only a few minutes to fill out. The reason why the general business community feels it is difficult is actually due to two misunderstandings: ㊀ They mistakenly believe that capital is an asset and think that it must be appraised, which has led to delays and hesitation. ㊁ They mistakenly believe that after filing the capital, they will be restricted, not knowing that if there is an increase or decrease in the capital amount after filing, they can still file for a change.

### Song Ziwen and Others Prepare to Organize a Grain Transportation and Sales Company

Total Capital Temporarily Set at 10 Million National Currency - Initiator Meeting Scheduled to be Held Soon - Adjusting Domestic Grain Surpluses and Deficits to Balance Prices

According to Xin Xin News Agency, regarding the matter of adjusting the rice shortage in Guangdong Province and organizing a grain transportation and sales company, a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency visited Mr. Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council who is in charge of the preparations, yesterday afternoon to inquire about the truth.

Origin of Organization

It is understood that the organization of the company originated after Mr. Song Ziwen went to Guangdong Province last year to inspect. When Mr. Song visited Guangdong, it was during the rice panic in Guangdong Province. Mr. Song used his economic vision to pay attention to the national rice problem. China was originally an agricultural country, but in recent years, there have been frequent grain panics. The quantity of imported foreign rice is lacking. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, 8 million to 10 million dan are imported annually, costing approximately 80 million to 100 million yuan. The huge loss is appalling. However, considering the rice produced in China, such as the production in Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, there are no statistics on the production amount, and the degree of scarcity has become a question. If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, it will not only affect the people's livelihood, but also harm the national economy. Therefore, since returning from the inspection, he has taken the opinions of people in Guangdong Province on improving grain and collected opinions from all parties. After detailed research, he decided to organize a transportation and sales company.

Three Main Points

Mr. Song's principles include three main points: ㊀ To sincerely adjust the domestic rice surplus and deficit, transporting and selling it in a timely manner, so that surplus areas avoid congestion and low prices that harm farmers, and deficit areas do not have to buy foreign rice, preventing the outflow of resources. The goal is to eliminate contradictory phenomena and recover some of the losses. ㊁ To balance prices, so that market prices do not rise or fall sharply throughout the year. If grain prices are too low, farmers will not be able to profit, and if grain prices are too high, the livelihood of the common people will be difficult. ㊂ The company's organization is commercial in nature, so in addition to investment from the banking industry and overseas Chinese, it is hoped that domestic grain merchants will join the company to make it a purely privately-run grain transportation agency.

Steps in Progress

Preparations have been underway for two months. In order to make the operation commercially economical, it has not been announced to the outside world, so the plan is very ambitious, but the progress is very steady, in order to avoid exaggeration and neglect of the facts. After the company is established, the initial transportation and sales will first be from rice-producing areas such as Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan to Guangdong and Fujian provinces, because these two provinces are the most rice-deficient areas, and then gradually expand to the rest of the country. The rice that is transported and sold will focus on high-quality rice, so that rural areas will pay attention to improving rice varieties and improving the quality of rice. Whether the company name will be "China Grain Transportation and Sales Company" remains to be decided. The capital amount is tentatively set at 10 million yuan. An initiator meeting is planned to be held in the near future. In addition to Mr. Song himself, participants will also include Sun Zhesheng, Wu Tiecheng, and other Guangdong natives, as well as many leaders from the banking industry.

### Liu Luyin Arrested in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

Related to the Tang and Yang Assassination Cases

A Central News Agency report states that Central Committee member Liu Luyin was arrested in front of the Yangtze Hotel yesterday morning at 1:30 AM by officers from the Old Zha Police Station in conjunction with detectives from the Police Bureau, due to his involvement in the assassination cases of Tang Youren and Yang Yongtai. The details are as follows:

Arrival History

Mr. Liu had been residing in Hong Kong for years. This time, he traveled north from Hong Kong to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, intending to pass through Shanghai to Beijing before the session opened. However, on the 21st, before the session concluded, he came to Shanghai in advance and stayed in room 612 of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road.

Reason for Arrest

Mr. Liu was involved in the assassination cases of Tang Youren and Yang Yongtai in the past two years. Definite evidence has been found. The Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to dispatch several detectives to arrange the arrest, while also informing the police station to assist in the arrest. The Special District Court issued an arrest warrant, which was handed over to the police station for execution.

Details of the Arrest

At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, Mr. Liu, accompanied by his wife, left the Yangtze Hotel. As they reached the gate, detectives from the Police Bureau who were waiting outside stepped forward to arrest him. Mr. Liu refused to comply, arguing that the officers had not shown him an arrest warrant, leading to a dispute. At this time, six Chinese and foreign detectives from the Old Zha Police Station also arrived and took Mr. and Mrs. Liu to the police station. His wife was later released as she was not involved in the case.

Court Hearing

At around 8:00 AM, the police station escorted Mr. Liu to the First Special District Court. The court session began at 10:00 AM, with Judge Feng Shide presiding alongside the clerk. First, the police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, described the details of the arrest. Mr. Liu denied any involvement in the two assassination cases. Lawyer Ru requested an investigation and permission to postpone the transfer for another hearing. Mr. Liu's defense lawyer, Wang Shou'an, requested that he be allowed bail pending trial. Judge Feng declared that the case would be reheard on Monday morning and that Mr. Liu would be temporarily detained. Therefore, Mr. Liu was taken back by the police station at 11:00 AM. It is said that the police bureau will request a transfer during the next hearing.

Special Treatment

The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, considering Liu Min's status as a Central Committee member, gave him special treatment. He was held alone in a room within the Old Zha Police Station and was not subjected to any restraints, unlike other common criminals. It is said that Mr. Liu's bedding and food were provided by his wife.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th reports that Liu Luyin has been residing in Hong Kong in recent years and only recently came to Shanghai. He once came to Beijing, but Mr. Liu was not seen attending the Third Plenary Session. Now, it is suddenly heard that he was arrested in Shanghai and has been handed over to the First Special District Court by the Public Concession Police. After much inquiry, reporters learned that Mr. Liu has secretly organized a reactionary group in recent years called the "Revolutionary Corps," with himself as the leader. He also established a "Chinese Youth Special Service Team," assigning party members to carry out assassination work in Beijing, Hubei, Shanghai, and other places. The expenses were allocated by Liu at a fixed amount of 2,000 yuan per month, managed by his confidant Xiao Runyun. He also deployed transportation personnel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei provinces, and the Beijing-Shanghai area, with a monthly expense of 1,000 yuan. The targets were mainly in Beijing and Hubei. After the Yang Yongtai assassination case last year, the perpetrators Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, and key figures and accomplices such as Yang Qixin were successively arrested. They confessed that Yang Erqian was also involved, acting on Liu's orders in Wuhan, planning to kill Yang and then continue assassinating important party and state officials. Later, Yang Erqian's address in Shanghai was discovered. Detectives went to search for him, but Yang had already fled in fear of guilt. They kept watch at Yang's residence. Xiao Ruoxu came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, intending to meet Yang Erqian at Yang's residence, and was arrested by the guards. When questioned, Xiao said that he had met Xiao Runyun at Liu Luyin's residence in Hong Kong, who told him about the assassination of Yang Yongtai and asked him to go to Shanghai to personally instruct Yang Erqian to return to Hong Kong quickly because communication was too inconvenient. Xiao said that the assassination of Yang Yongtai was actually instigated by Liu Luyin. It is heard that the authorities in charge of this case plan to issue a public announcement to the people regarding Liu's reactionary organization, assassination plans, and related confessions. It is also heard that Liu is also suspected of being heavily involved in the Tang Youren assassination case.

Special measures were stipulated in five articles, which are notified for public knowledge. The details are as follows:

Bank History

The Farmers Bank of China was originally the Farmers Bank of the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, established with the special permission of the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record.

It ordered the bank to comply and reported it to the Executive Yuan for record. Now, the Ministry finds that since the bank's banknotes were previously stipulated to circulate in the same manner as legal tender, it should also bear foreign exchange responsibilities. All issuance reserve funds should be immediately handed over to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for management in accordance with regulations, to consolidate the credit of legal tender. Special measures are stipulated below: 1.

The Farmers Bank of China's foreign exchange reserves for issuing banknotes should be handled in consultation with the Central Bank. 4. The Farmers Bank of China's banknote issuance area should focus on important agricultural areas and border provinces. 5. The Farmers Bank of China should conscientiously handle rural mortgage loans and land mortgage loans in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Finance. In addition to reporting the above measures to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for record, and distributing them to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, the Central Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China, the Ministry also issues a joint notice for public knowledge.

### Estonian Nationals Celebrate National Day Yesterday

The China Press reports that today (the 24th) is the National Day of the small Baltic country of Estonia. Estonian nationals around the world will hold celebrations. The country was ruled by Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia for about 800 years. During the European War, with the help of the British Navy and some Finnish volunteers, it won against Soviet Russia and declared independence on February 24, 1928. There are not many Estonian nationals in this city. At 6:00 PM tonight, they will gather at the residence of their representative in Shanghai, Mr. Lunberg, to hold a meeting to celebrate. This year, because the country's constitution is about to be changed in the near future, its nationals are particularly excited. Last October, the head of state, Mr. Pats, ordered the dissolution of parliament due to differences in political views and ordered the people to vote for a new parliament, which was established in January of this year. Its first task will be to draft a new constitution. Although the country is small in area, 60% of its people are engaged in agriculture, and the rest are half engaged in various industries and half are professionals, so there is no unemployment problem in the country. Its main agricultural exports are butter, cheese, pickles, eggs, hemp, etc., and the number of livestock transported to Soviet Russia every year is very large. The country is rich in forests, so there are more than 200 sawmills. Most of its timber is sold to the United States. Compulsory education has been implemented in the country, so the level of culture is very high. A large song festival is held every four years, with 1,600 singers and 80,000 to 100,000 listeners from all over the country.

(3) Should the industry report the deposits received to the association for record? It was decided that the association should report it. (4) The industry should request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to extract a 20% handling fee for the income tax withheld from deposit interest, so as to subsidize depositors and avoid evasion. It was decided to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately to submit the request on its behalf.

### Grain, Bean, and Rice Industries Jointly Sent a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday

Regarding the Inclusion of Public Reserve Funds into Capital, Please Submit a Request to the Ministry of Finance for Clarification

The Shanghai Grain, Oil Cake, Bean, and Rice Industries Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the revision of the income tax issue, stating that the association raised reasons at the study session regarding the Regulations of the Income Tax Affairs. The association stated the points about Public Reserve Funds in accordance with the enforcement regulations of the provisional affairs which stated that; "(2) Those with public reserve funds may calculate one-third of the total amount into capital," and item 10 of the draft Collection Guidelines for Category I, "If the public reserve fund has reached one-half of the total capital, the public reserve fund drawn cannot be regarded as a legal public reserve fund," the meeting has been asked to adopt reason and resolution. The association asked to permit the public reserve fund of profit-making enterprises to be fully incorporated into capital, and to cancel the restriction that the public reserve fund reaching one-half of the capital cannot be regarded as a legal public reserve fund as they considered that would shake the foundation of the entire commercial industry. At the meeting, the congress voted and asked the council to ask the authorities to adopt it on a special project. It has been a month since the incident, but there has been no approval. The above two issues are of great importance to the subjects of taxpayers. Now, the Ministry of Finance announced that capital must be declared before the end of February. The deadline is approaching in an instant. The merchants of each industry are eager to have a clear expression on this issue. It is currently hoped to make it clear before the deadline of reporting. It is really a big question how to calculate and fill in the actual amount of business capital shares in the declaration form. It is feared that it will not be possible to report as scheduled. Therefore, the association is again sending a letter to the council, requesting it to ask the authorities to quickly and clearly announce the above issue, so that it can be followed. This is what the association prayed for.

### Silk Industry Association Offers Rewards to Encourage Reporting of Smuggling

The Shanghai Silk Industry Association, in view of the flooding of smuggled goods in recent years, which has damaged national taxes and disrupted the market, causing a great impact on legitimate silk, specially held a silk industry anti-smuggling meeting in September last year to assist the customs in handling anti-smuggling matters. Since then, the trend of smuggling has been greatly reduced. Now, the association believes that smugglers have many tricks and is concerned that there may be loopholes if it is not careful. Therefore, in addition to notifying members to hold a general inspection regularly, it has also published a notice in the newspaper that anyone who secretly deals in smuggled goods among the industry can report to the association or the customs. Once the investigation is confirmed, in addition to receiving the customs bonus, the association will award 300 yuan in national currency.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Distributes Income Tax Declaration Forms

The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the capital amount and deposits received by each business unit that should be reported have been published in Shanghai newspapers by the office's General Notice No. 5, and all are limited to filling out the forms and submitting them to the office for registration by the end of February. Now that the deadline is approaching, business units are coming to the office in an endless stream to obtain the aforementioned reporting forms, which shows that the council is leading the merchants and knowing how to follow the laws and support good taxes, which is deeply appreciated. For the convenience of business units, it is now sending 1,000 deposit reporting forms and 1,000 capital amount reporting forms. It is hoped that the council will receive them and separately notify each business unit to go to the council's distribution office to collect and fill out the forms. If there are not enough forms, please notify the office by telegram at any time, and the office will send someone to continue sending them. However, regarding the deadline for reporting various items, it is feared that each business unit is not very clear or is still waiting and seeing, resulting in the office being deeply concerned about the distant laws. It is planned to convene the heads of each trade association within this month for instructions. If necessary, the office can also send personnel to attend and participate, always with the goal of political and commercial harmony and unity, so as to avoid hindering each other. It is appropriate to send a letter to find out and deal with it, and it is hoped to see a reply for your efforts. The items related to this letter are that the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance has restricted all trade to declare their assets, and receipt of deposits by the end of February. All trades are reminded that they can obtain a declaration form from the commercial headquarters and return a completed form.

The Social Bureau is sending personnel to mediate, which has been completely resolved. The workers are requested to go to the factory for work as usual on February 22. All workers should work with peace of mind. This notice, the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau, in order to avoid the expansion of the situation, after consultation, jointly issued a notice yesterday, strictly ordering the workers to resume work within the deadline and wait for a legal solution quietly.

### A Returnee from Dalian Speaks

Our reporter interviewed a friend who had just returned from Dalian yesterday. According to the friend, the commercial situation there has deteriorated drastically since the strict crackdown on smuggling in various places. Currently, most of the warehouses in Dalian are occupied by smuggled goods. Opium dens and gambling dens are everywhere in the city, and a group of unprincipled traitors are taking advantage of the situation, treating opium and gambling as sources of profit, and oppressing merchants in every possible way. Therefore, most merchants feel extremely miserable, and some have abandoned their businesses and returned home because they cannot bear the oppression. In addition, there is another matter that deserves attention: In April and May of this year, the puppet Manchukuo government planned to dredge the Yingkou Port in the Bohai Bay, and the engineering plan was ready. However, it was estimated that there would not be enough workers, so it was planned to recruit workers from various places. All procedures were handled by a company in Qingdao, with a limit of 3,000 recruits. In addition to issuing permits, fourth-class boat tickets would also be provided. It is said that this is currently being planned in secret. It is hoped that the authorities in various places will pay attention to this and that the people of the country will be self-respecting and not be tempted by profit.

### The Japanese Ship Post Office Issue

Report from the Japanese Embassy in China

Shanghai, 24th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Communications has established post offices on the Sino-Japanese liaison ships Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru in order to benefit passengers and expedite postal affairs between the two countries. However, it seems that the Chinese side has various misunderstandings about this. Therefore, the Japanese Embassy in China issued the following statement today regarding this matter: "The post offices established on the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru are the same as those established on ships on the North American routes. Mail deposited on the ships will be sorted during the voyage. Therefore, in addition to expediting mail delivery between the two countries, it is also intended to benefit passengers. The post office windows will only be open during the voyage, and the post offices will be closed when the ships are docked in Shanghai. Therefore, the sale of stamps is out of the question, and even ten-packet bundles cannot be accepted. This is very clear. Moreover, mail accepted on the ships must have Republic of China stamps affixed. If Japanese stamps are mistakenly affixed without Republic of China stamps, it will be treated as underpaid postage. Therefore, the postal rights of the Republic of China have not been infringed."

### Foreign Minister Zhang's Residence Burglarized, Losses Not Severe

The total value is no more than two or three hundred yuan, and there were no significant losses as reported.

### The Municipal Government's Protest Against the Shanghai Grand Theatre Case; Italian Consul to Reply This Morning

Originally scheduled for yesterday morning, postponed due to careful consideration

New Sound News Agency: Regarding the case of Italian sailors vandalizing the Shanghai Grand Theatre, after the Municipal Government lodged a protest with the Italian Consul General's Office in Shanghai, the Italian Consulate had already drafted a reply, which was scheduled to be delivered yesterday morning. However, as of 5:00 PM yesterday, after the Municipal Government's office hours, the Municipal Government had not yet received the reply. A reporter then inquired with Italian Vice-Consul Macauli, who revealed that the reply had been postponed to this morning due to the need for careful consideration.

The English-language "China Press" reports that the Italian authorities in Shanghai will reply tomorrow (the 25th) to the Shanghai Municipal Government's protest against the Italian sailors' vandalism of the Shanghai Grand Theatre last Saturday. However, the Italian Consul General in Shanghai and the Italian naval authorities are still maintaining strict silence regarding this case. The Italian Embassy has not yet responded to the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest. Furthermore, the case of the clash between British and Italian soldiers on Zhu Baosan Road in the French Concession on Sunday night is still under investigation by the authorities. The British and Italian authorities are still prohibiting their soldiers from entering the dance halls in that area to prevent further conflicts.

The "North China Daily News" reports that the owner of the Shanghai Grand Theatre, a Russian expatriate, in addition to collecting evidence regarding the riot on Saturday, has requested the Soviet Russian Consul General in Shanghai to lodge a protest with the local Italian authorities. The Soviet Russian authorities hope to resolve this case in a reasonable manner to avoid further escalation of the situation. Furthermore, the two British soldiers injured in the clash on Zhu Baosan Road on Sunday night were not as seriously injured as initially reported. It is reported that they will return to the military hospital. Although British and Italian soldiers are still prohibited from going to Zhu Baosan Road for entertainment, the British soldiers are not confined to their barracks. As for the truth of the case, the relevant authorities will only issue a statement after the details have been clarified.

His daughter, Xinbao, was 18 years old and had married Zang Daqian, who ran the Shiyuan Teahouse at No. 1371 Guangfu Road, at the age of 15. However, due to her husband's violent nature, their marriage was unhappy. During the New Year two years ago, Xinbao wanted to return to her parents' home for the New Year's celebrations, but Zang resented his in-laws and refused to allow her to go. Xinbao still returned to her mother's home after her husband left. Zang found out when he returned home and was furious that his wife had disobeyed him. He exercised his rights as a husband and rushed over that night to bring his wife back. He beat her with his fists. As a result, the couple's relationship deteriorated further. On September 2nd, Xinbao, unable to bear her husband's oppression, committed suicide by hanging herself. The case was reported to the local court, which sent Prosecutor Li Fen to examine and collect the body. Nearly two years later, Zhang Shou Peng recently reopened the case, stating that his daughter was forced to return home late at night when she was prevented from visiting her parents' home for the New Year's celebrations two years ago. She was pressed onto the bed, her head covered with a quilt, her body straddled, and beaten with leather shoes, leaving her body covered in injuries. At that time, the teahouse customers had not yet left, and Wang Dechao and Chen Xiaoerzi, among others, rescued her. From then on, the abuse increased, forcing her to commit suicide. Therefore, his daughter's death can be said to be a result of the beatings and the hanging, and that she would not have died if she had not been beaten and hanged. He said that the initial examination was obscured by the deception and requested that Wang Dechao and Chen Xiaoerzi be called as witnesses and a re-examination be conducted. After the prosecutor questioned them, he considered the case to be strange and to have other intentions, so he decided to wait for further investigation.

### The Little Kidnap Victim Returns Safely

The Kidnappers Have Been Caught; Trial Today

Yang Rongfu, the owner of the Dachang Porcelain Shop at No. 130 Kai Zi Er Road in the French Concession, a native of Wuxi, had a six-year-old son named Huiqi, who disappeared suddenly on the morning of the 17th of last month while playing at the entrance of the alley next to the shop. After searching in vain, the family received a threatening letter from the kidnappers by mail, demanding 2,000 gold pieces for ransom and specifying a location for negotiations. Yang then realized that his beloved son had been kidnapped and prepared the money to go to the appointed location on time, but no one from the kidnappers met him. Later, Zhang Yunqing, a tailor and fellow townsman of Yang, pretending to be a kidnapper, wrote a letter to Yang, enticing him to negotiate the ransom at the Southeast Inn at the entrance of Ruifu Lane on East Zilai Yan Street. After receiving the letter, Yang reported it to the French Police Station, which sent detectives disguised as waiters and travelers to wait at the Southeast Inn. Zhang was arrested and interrogated. Zhang confessed that he was impersonating a kidnapper in an attempt to swindle money from the victim. He was sent to the court for interrogation. At the same time, the detectives conducted a thorough investigation and arrested the kidnappers Cai Fuxing (the victim's driver), Wu Jinshu, Chen Shouming, Shi Dexing, and four other people. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The escaped gang of bandits, because they could not exchange the ransom for money and their accomplices had already fallen into the hands of the law, fearing that they would be implicated in the future, on the evening of the 19th of this month, the bandits carried the kidnapped child Yang Huiqi to the door of the Ju Xin Rice Shop near the victim's shop and ordered him to go home. Yang Rongfu and his wife were overjoyed to see their beloved son safely returned home. They asked him about his experience of being kidnapped and hidden and reported it to the French Police Station to arrest the remaining members of the gang of kidnappers. It is now known that the French Police Station has completed the investigation of the four kidnappers who were arrested. Today, at 10 AM, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special Court will conduct a public trial in the First Criminal Court. At that time, the lawyer from the Police Department will formally file a public prosecution in accordance with the law.

### Revisions to the Freight Rates for Livestock Transport on Two Railways Will Be Implemented Next Month

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus previously had special prices for transporting yellow cattle, water buffalo, and large pigs. However, due to the additional 10% surcharge, the calculation was particularly complicated.

This has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways and approved, and will be implemented starting next month. The revised freight rates are listed below: ① Water buffalo on the Beijing-Shanghai Line: 62% discount from 2 cents per head per kilometer; yellow cattle on the Beijing-Shanghai Line: 47% discount from 2 cents per head per kilometer; ② Yellow cattle or water buffalo from Zhakou, Nanxingqiao, Gongchenqiao to Wangdian, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Weijing: 1.1 cents per head per kilometer. If the origin and destination are not within the designated stations above, it is 1.8 cents per head per kilometer. On the Cao-Yong section, it is 1.8 cents per head per kilometer; ③ Large pigs from Jiangbian, Nanjing to Nanxingqiao and Zhakou in Hang, West Hill Gate: 1 yuan and 8 cents per head; from Wuxi to Nanxingqiao and West Hill Gate in Hang: 72 cents per head; from Zhenjiang West Station and Ben Niu to Nanxingqiao, West Hill Gate, Gongchenqiao, and Zhakou in Hangzhou: 90 cents per head; on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line (excluding the Cao-Yong section), 40% discount from 5 li per head per kilometer; on the Gong-Zha branch line, 15 cents per head.

On the coal ash heap in the open space opposite No. 400 Xinqiao Tou on the south side of Shanghai (i.e., west of Lujiabang Road), at around 7 AM yesterday, a coal-picking laborer from Jiangbei was picking up coal ash when he suddenly noticed an old white undershirt wrapped around something. Suspecting that it was an unexpected gain, he opened it with a bamboo hook, only to discover that it was shockingly the head of a victim, along with half of his chest. The rest of the torso, lower body, and limbs had all been cut off without a trace. The head and face had been shaved and stabbed with a knife, and the flesh was a bloody mess.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Plans a Budget Procedure

The draft budgets of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department, Education Department, and other departments were published in the newspapers a few days ago. Readers may have thought that these draft budgets had already been approved by the board of directors. In fact, this is not the case. According to the Council's proposed budget procedure, each draft must first be discussed by the director of the department concerned and the director of the Finance Department. The director of the Finance Department will sign and comment on it and submit it to the responsible committee. After the committee considers it, it will submit its recommendations to the board of directors for approval and allow the Finance Committee to review it. After the Finance Committee has compiled all the draft budgets from each department, it will consider them comprehensively. Before the draft is submitted to the board of directors for final approval, the director of the Finance Department must consult with the directors of the other departments and the Finance Committee must revise it again. The draft budget now submitted to the board of directors has only gone through the preliminary procedure. The purpose is to allow the directors to understand the views of the responsible committee on a particular plan and to allow the directors to express their preliminary views for the Finance Committee to consider.

### Lantern Festival Tide on Huangpu River Extraordinarily High Today

Reaching Over Eleven Feet

Occurring Around Midnight

The Datong News Agency reports that heavy fog has plagued the city for several days, significantly impacting transportation. The day before yesterday, heavy rain poured down, continuing intermittently into the night. Yesterday morning, although the rain was sparse,

the sky remained overcast

and extremely gloomy. The north wind blew frequently, causing a sharp drop in temperature, and the atmospheric pressure was very low. Therefore, continuous rain is likely, and there is no hope for clear skies in the near future. This year's rainfall has already been ample, and if the drizzle continues, the spring flowers will inevitably lose their luster. According to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's prediction, a high tide will occur in the Huangpu River today (the 25th). Such a large tide is rare during the spring and winter seasons, and therefore warrants close attention. The bureau's measurements for

today's tide

are as follows: the tide will begin to rise at 11:15 AM, and the rate of increase will suddenly become rapid at 12:02 PM. At that time, the current speed will be approximately 1.9 nautical miles per hour. The tide will reach its peak at 12:40 PM, with a height of approximately 11 feet 5 inches (the height of the Bund embankment is 13 feet), very close to the riverbank. The tide will begin to recede at approximately 3:20 PM and will be completely gone after 9:00 PM. When the tide is at its peak, the low-lying area of Ma Road may be flooded.

### Italian Impersonating Detective Surrenders After Intimidation and Extortion

Voluntarily Reports to Italian Consulate, But Denies Extortion. Chinese National Shen Xinglu Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months.

Shi Huanzhang, a compradore in the insurance department of the Taikoo Steamship Company, residing at No. 8 Fanshe Lane, Mu'erming Road, was visited by a Westerner and four Chinese on the 17th of this month at 3:30 PM. Impersonating Chinese and Western detectives from the police, they used the pretext of searching for opium to extort 400 yuan. Afterwards, Shi reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which arrested Yong native Shen Xinglu, and suspects Li Jiren and the woman Shen Lao Si. The three were sent to the First Court. After investigation, it was determined that Shen Lao Si was not involved and she was

released first.

The situation of Shen and Li being detained again has been recorded in this newspaper and is being rescheduled. The Italian, Contini, who impersonated a Western detective, was also arrested by the police and sent to the Italian Consulate for interrogation. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial of this case at the Eighth Criminal Court. First, Police Attorney Li Zhishan stated that during the rescheduling, it was found that the defendant Li Jiren was also not involved and requested permission to discontinue his detention. Judge Huang approved Li's release. The attorney then continued, stating that

after this case occurred

, Chinese Detective Tang Jian of the Jing'an Temple Police Station discovered that the person impersonating the Western detective was related to the Italian Contini. After detailed questioning of the suspect Shen Xinglu, it was indeed found to be Contini's doing. In addition to Shen himself, there were other accomplices Du Tianzeng, Wang Liqun, and Shao Laoyi, who are currently at large. While the police were in the process of arresting Contini, Contini had already heard about it and surrendered himself to the

Italian Consulate.

After interrogation, it was learned that Contini was a special patrolman No. 95 of the Public Concession Police, with police credentials. Three months ago, he met the defendant Shen Xinglu and Shao Laoyi at the office of Attorney Shi Jiutang on the fifth floor of No. 35 Beijing Road. Shen and Shao were both working at Attorney Shi's office. Attorney Shi used Contini's Western status, believing that he would be more effective than a Chinese person in cases such as representing debt recovery, and thus hired Contini as a collection agent. Contini also

operated a wine business

and entrusted the defendant to sell his wine. Therefore, they traveled back and forth frequently. This year, during the Lunar New Year, the defendant went to Shao Laoyi's house at No. 3 Yongle Xing, Kaizi'er Road, in the French Concession to pay his respects. They discussed that a wealthy family on Mu'erming Road had a large sum of money and smokers, so it would be possible to extort them. Thus, Contini, Shen Xinglu, and the fugitives Shao, Du, and Wang went to Shi Huanzhang's house at No. 8 Fanshe Lane. Shao first knocked on the door and entered, impersonating Chinese and Western detectives, and sent the defendant to the side of the staircase to

monitor the telephone

to prevent information from leaking. They began searching and then discovered that Shi's wife's aunt, Chen Shenmin, was smoking. They then used this as an excuse to extort money, initially demanding over a thousand yuan, and eventually receiving four hundred yuan before leaving. During interrogation at the Italian Consulate, Contini only admitted to going to collect a debt and denied impersonating a detective and extorting money. The police are prosecuting the defendant not only for extortion under Article 346 of the criminal code but also

adding Article

158 of the criminal code for impersonating a public official. The witness Chen Suzhen testified that Shi Huanzhang is my sister's husband. That day, a Westerner and four Chinese came, claiming to be detectives sent by the police to search for opium. The defendant Shen Xinglu even went upstairs. While I was talking, my aunt had already begun negotiating the price with Shao Pangyi. Shao initially demanded over a thousand yuan, otherwise, he would take me and my aunt to the police station in the large car. My aunt was afraid and ordered me to take out 400 yuan and give it to them before they left. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he

went with Contini

, Shao Laoyi, Du Tianzeng, and Wang Liqun and stood by the staircase, but he did not know about the extortion and did not receive any money. Judge Huang reviewed the confession and sentenced Shen Xinglu to two years and six months in prison for jointly using intimidation to cause a person to hand over their property, and fined him 400 yuan as a warning. The Italian Consulate will try Contini.

### Merchant Ship Accident in Heavy Fog

Nan Jin Maru Sinks

Victory Escapes Reef Unscathed

The Victory, owned by the Zhengji Company, weighing 3,087 tons, 297 feet 5 inches long, 18 feet deep, and 40 feet 1 inch wide, with a draft of 19 feet 8 inches, was carrying cargo to Nanhua. The company received a telegram from its shipowner yesterday, stating that the Victory had encountered heavy fog near the Ninepins off the coast of Hong Kong, causing the ship to run aground on a reef. However, it automatically escaped the reef during high tide and sailed to Hong Kong. Due to the heavy fog at sea, it was unable to navigate and temporarily dropped anchor. It will enter Hong Kong after the fog clears for inspection.

Min Gui Barge Collision

The Min Gui, owned by the Minsheng Industrial Company, was carrying goods from Yichang to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, near the No. 1 River Tube outside the Wusong estuary, a large tugboat owned by the Taikoo Company was sailing from Shanghai to the Wusong estuary. Due to the heavy fog, the two ships could not see each other in advance and collided when they were close. The iron plates of the Min Gui were damaged, and the hull of the barge was also damaged. After the accident, both ships sailed to Shanghai. A surveyor will inspect the damage before repairs are made.

The No. 1 Yoshida Maru, owned by the Yamashita Steamship Company of this port, which collided with the No. 23 Nanjin Maru in heavy fog off the coast of Wenzhou, occurred at 7:00 AM on the 23rd. The two ships were sailing in heavy fog when they collided. The hull of the Nanjin Maru immediately cracked and took on water, drifting on the sea. After the collision, the Yoshida Maru could still sail because the external damage was not serious. The crew of the Nanjin Maru was rescued by the Yoshida Maru, but three people went missing. The Nanjin Maru has now completely sunk. The Yoshida Maru arrived in Wusong at 10:00 AM yesterday to report the accident to the Yamashita Company. The ship anchored in Wusong and did not enter the port. The Yamashita Company immediately sent personnel to the ship to investigate the truth of the matter because its destination was not Shanghai.

### Miscellaneous Goods Company Embezzles Checks and Withdraws Large Sums of Money

Shopping, Making Clothes, and Repaying Debts; Surplus Funds Deposited in the Bank

Shu Shunfu, a Ningbo native working as a clerk at the Tonghe Miscellaneous Goods Company located at 217 Wuchang Road, secretly stole three blank checks from the company between January 6th and January 1st of this year. He affixed forged seals to them and subsequently had people withdraw funds from the Shanghai Wing On Hongwai Branch on North Sichuan Road. He embezzled a total of 922.30 yuan, which he spent before fleeing back to his home at 47 Yangmiao Front, Zhenhai South Gate in Ningbo. The case was reported to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Detective Fang Fucheng, armed with an official letter from the First Special District Court, to apprehend Shu at his address in coordination with the local police station. Shu was arrested and brought to Shanghai on the day before yesterday, where he was detained in the police station. A gold ring worth 28 yuan, a watch, and 5 yuan in national currency were found on his person. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the defendant confessed to the police that he had first used a check on December 26th of last year, through a friend named A Xiang, to withdraw 211.30 yuan. On January 8th of this year, he used two checks to withdraw 311 yuan and 400 yuan, all of which were collected by Chen from the Wing On Branch. He then fled back to Zhenhai on the 31st, having already spent 420 yuan on purchasing miscellaneous goods, making clothes, and repaying debts. The remaining 500 yuan was deposited in the Shanghai Savings Branch Bank at Xiaodongmen in this city, but the passbook was left at his home in Zhenhai. He therefore requested an extension to obtain proof from Wu Huanan, the Cantonese manager of Tonghe Miscellaneous Goods Company, regarding the defendant's withdrawal of funds. After Judge Pan Zhenyang questioned Shu, he admitted his guilt without reservation. The judge ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.

### Unification and Peace (Continued)

— Pan Gongzhan

㊅

Since we must exert the strength of the entire nation to achieve true unification, and then, when necessary, launch a comprehensive war of resistance against the enemy, our current problem is simply how to achieve unification? I have said before that unification can sometimes be achieved through war and sometimes through peaceful means. Since the September 18th Incident in 1931, because of the severity of the national crisis and the looming threat of a powerful enemy, the central government has always tried to achieve unification through peaceful means within the realm of possibility. However, relying solely on the government to seek unification through peaceful means is certainly not enough. Simply allowing the central government to request the remnants of warlords, begging them not to secede, is like seeking skin from a tiger. There must be the strength of the people as a backing to achieve unification through peaceful means. If the people do not use their strength to help the government seek unification through peaceful means, then in the inevitable moment, military force will still be required in the future. So, what peaceful methods can the people use to help the central government eliminate separatist forces and complete unification? To address this point, it is first necessary to understand that the obstacle to unification lies in the military system. Therefore, if it is possible to preserve the army while dissolving the system, then separatist forces will inevitably be eliminated without a single shot fired, and peaceful unification will be achieved.

What does it mean to preserve the army while dissolving the system? For example, in the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng alone could not have seceded. They relied on the military system to perform the trick of secession. Zhang Xueliang believed that the Northeast Army was his system, and Yang Hucheng believed that the Shaanxi Army was his system, so they dared to dream such a foolish dream of secession. Even Zhu De and Mao Zedong of the Communist Party believed that the "Red Army" was their system, so they fled from their old nest in Jiangxi to the border of Shaanxi and Gansu, still wanting to secede. Now our policy of peaceful unification is nothing more than preserving the army and dissolving the system. If the soldiers in the army ultimately refuse to betray the revolution and become bandits, but instead turn back and listen to the command of the central government, then the army must naturally be preserved; otherwise, eliminating 10,000 soldiers means losing 10,000 units of strength against foreign enemies. However, while the army is preserved, its system must be absolutely dissolved. We must not allow the so-called Northeast Army, Shaanxi Army... or even the so-called "Red Army" system of the Communist bandits to continue to exist. An army with an unbreakable system is entirely the idea of feudal warlords, an idea against unification. We should now only have the National Army of the Republic of China, not provincial armies, and only the National Revolutionary Army, with no further permission for the existence of the "Red Army." Once the military system is dissolved, the warlords will have no way to secede.

How to dissolve the military system? First, local politics should be completely separated from the military. The military must not interfere in local politics: all major powers such as military affairs, diplomacy, finance, and civil administration should be completely concentrated in the central government, and the military must not divide the central government's governing power. Second, the army should be separated from its stationed location. In a modern country, it has never been heard of that someone's army must be stationed in a certain place, and any attempt to move it will be met with resistance. Yet a portion of the Chinese army is like this. Can this still be considered the national army? Therefore, to ensure that the army does not have a fixed connection with its stationed location and can be transferred at any time, this is the way to resist enemies and to respect the central government and be loyal to the country. Third, the army should not have an absolute relationship with its commanding generals. If a certain division is assigned to a certain general as the division commander today, then the previous division commander should hand over the seals of office. This is how an army becomes the national army, and no longer the personal army of the division commander. Only when these three points are fully achieved can the forces of secession be considered eliminated through peaceful means. However, achieving these three points will certainly require the full power of the people. (To be continued)

### Cotton Yarn

After Receiving Goods, Zhang Chuan Uses套 to Emerge from the Three-Month Yarn Drop Breaking Through the 40 Yuan Barrier

Current Sales are Not Strong, and Third-Grade Products are Falling; Speculators are Panicked and the Downward Trend is Fierce

The yarn market continues to be sluggish, and the downward trend is becoming more intense. The weak situation is due to the active preparations for delivery in the February period, further dampening sentiment. According to market sources, some of the yarn received by the long positions has been used by 標紗 to套 emerge from the market, and some have been closed out. This rumor has spread, causing speculators to panic and the market to trend downward. The three-month contract has broken through the 40 yuan barrier, allowing some short positions to profit and offset losses.

All Months Drop by More Than Two Yuan

The 標紗 market opened with the three-month contract slightly up by 0.4 yuan, but as it approached the distant month, it tended to decline. This was because the warehouse had sufficient yarn inventory, and the industry expected prices to fall. As a result, the market loosened, and the downward trend intensified. In the second round of trading, the current month plummeted by 1.8 yuan, pulling the distant months into the whirlpool. Gengfeng, a long position, painfully closed out 7,000 bales, while Weirui, Dahexing, and Changfeng, short positions, profited and covered their positions. By the third closing, the price had rebounded by a few cents. The final result was that each month's price fell by 0.7-1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a slight rebound of a few cents due to profit-taking from the morning. However, after the opening, rumors spread that long positions were closing out and selling, while the prices of third-grade yarns slightly rebounded. Current sales were not strong, and the downward trend intensified until the closing, with the three-month contract breaking through the 40 yuan barrier. As a result, each month's price fell again by 1.39 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. It was found that Taixing sold 3,200 bales, leaving 900 bales remaining; Tongji 1,100 bales; Juxing 1,100 bales; Jinchang 2,550 bales; Gengfeng 7,000 bales; Xingchang 1,200 bales; Yuanyi 3,190 bales; Runkang 2,150 bales; and Fengtai 850 bales. Mingde bought 2,100 bales; Hengyi 3,450 bales; Changji 1,000 bales; and Hexing 2,700 bales. The highest and lowest prices are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Prices Also Fall; Spot Yarn Sales Are Average

It was found that various groups purchased a total of 943 bales throughout the day, and the selling prices fell by 1-3 yuan. The purchase amounts of each group are listed below.

### Han Xin

— Lu Minggao

—Self-Reliance is the Foundation of Personal Success—

"Mom, Uncle Xin hasn't come for several days..." The child said, holding his rice bowl in both hands and tilting his head to look at his mother.

"He's only been gone for one day, and you miss him so much!" The mother said unhappily, then put a piece of meat in the child's bowl, "Come on, he gobbles everything up, eats a lot, and always picks the best parts. If he comes, will there still be any meat left for your little mouth?"

The child didn't say anything after hearing his mother's words, but he didn't agree with her at all. He remembered that Uncle Xin never ate more than him when he came to eat, and he always gave him the best parts. He didn't understand why his mother was so annoyed by Uncle Xin.

After dinner, the mother was weaving cloth in the hall, and the child was flying a kite in the yard. The string was short, and the kite was small, so it wouldn't fly. The child was getting anxious when someone knocked on the door, but he was too lazy to open it.

"Long'er, what's wrong? Why don't you go open the door! Maybe Dad is back with a big kite."

Long'er heard his mother's words and quickly jumped up to open the door. It turned out that it wasn't anyone else, it was Uncle Xin.

Han Xin was a little different today! He was wearing a new hat and a new sword, and he walked in proudly. His face was red, obviously he had been drinking a lot of wine. Long'er carried Han Xin's sword and hugged him into the hall, saying as they walked:

"Uncle Xin, where did you get this sword? It looks like my dad's - have you eaten yet? We're having boiled sheep's head today."

Xin smiled without saying a word, and went forward to bow to the woman weaving cloth at the loom:

"Sister-in-law Huang, Brother Huang asked me to tell you that there's something going on at the pavilion today, and he doesn't have time to come back."

Sister-in-law Huang didn't get off the loom, but stopped her work, twisted her body, and looked Xin up and down, then said half-complimenting and half-mocking:

"Han Dalang, congratulations, you must have become an official! A tall hat, a long sword, and both of them are new, so majestic!"

Xin felt embarrassed and couldn't say anything. Long'er saw that it wasn't his dad bringing back a big kite, and he didn't find the adults' conversation interesting, so he quietly slipped back into the yard. After a while, Xin finally said, blushing:

"Isn't this all Brother Huang's doing? This morning he came to the inn to find me and said, 'Brother Xin, I don't think I've offended you in any way, why did you run away in a fit of pique?' I said, 'How dare I be angry? It's just that I've been eating off you for so long, Brother, and I haven't made any progress in repaying your kindness. I feel ashamed, so I have no face to stay any longer. I'm already a young man who's fully twenty years old, not a child anymore, so how can I still rely on others and not seek self-reliance?' Unexpectedly, as soon as Brother heard me say I was twenty years old, he grabbed me and said, 'Brother Xin, there's no need to talk about the past. From today on, you'll still come back to my house, and I'll treat you like my own brother. It's rare that you're twenty years old this year. Twenty is when a man comes of age, it's a major event in life, and today is a good day, so let me perform the coming-of-age ceremony for you.' Brother didn't let me explain, but bought a new hat for me to wear and invited some friends to drink a few celebratory drinks at the tavern. Before leaving, Brother also said that my sword was too short and old, and didn't look good, so he insisted on swapping it with his."

"So that's how it is, you've taken advantage of your brother," Sister-in-law Huang immediately turned her face, "But this sword is what I saved money to buy for him, please give it back to me, buy yourself another one! You've been away from us for a few days, and it's said that you've had great luck, so you wouldn't care about this little bit of money."

She was forcing Xin to take off the sword, while yelling loudly outside:

"Long'er, open the door for Uncle Xin to go out and buy a sword, he also promised to buy you a big kite."

Xin helplessly walked away with heavy steps. The somewhat sensible Long'er was still gesturing behind him, loudly urging:

"Uncle Xin, the kite must be at least this big, small ones can't fly. It would be best if you bought me a bundle of string too."

He watched Han Xin go far away, then closed the door, thinking: "As long as I have a big kite. It doesn't matter if I don't buy string, I can steal the yarn my mother uses to weave cloth to make string." He suddenly remembered how he had been caught by his mother yesterday for stealing yarn and had his thigh bruised, and he couldn't help reaching out to touch the scar, and tears welled up. He thought again: "It would be better if Uncle Xin bought the string too."

Before dinner, Xin came back. He had a newly bought sword on his waist, but his hands were empty, with neither a kite nor string. Long'er knew that he had been deceived, and cried for a kite, refusing to eat. Sister-in-law Huang also got angry and beat Long'er again. She whipped her son, scolding Han Xin in her mouth:

"Don't say anything, haven't you been eating for free in our house for two or three years? Buying a kite for the child can't even be considered repaying kindness. Who knew that 'a pint of rice raises a grateful person, a bushel of rice raises an enemy'? You have money to buy a sword, but no money to buy a kite?" She suddenly put down her hand and stopped hitting the child, changing her tone, "Useless child, you've mistaken a good person! You want a kite! You should ask your dad, how can you..."

Before she could finish speaking, someone suddenly pushed open the door and walked in. It was an apprentice swordsmith. He saw Sister-in-law Huang's face at this moment and was very afraid. He said in a flustered manner:

"Please forgive my impoliteness! I knocked on the door for a long time, but no one came to open it. It turned out that the door was ajar, and it opened with a gentle push."

"What are you saying? You're not making sense. Just tell me, what are you here for?"

The apprentice didn't know what to say, now that she was urging him. He breathed a few times and then looked at the restless Han Xin and said:

"I'm looking for Han Dalang to talk!"

"What's so secretive? You have to make it clear here." She stood up and blocked the doorway of the hall, afraid that the visitor would leave.

"My master wasn't home today, so I took the liberty of selling a sword to Han Dalang on credit. Just now, my master came back and said that Han Dalang is a poor person who wouldn't have money to buy a sword, and he wanted me to come back immediately to get the sword back."

Han Xin stood aside, his face turning from blue to purple, extremely embarrassed! He couldn't explain himself, so he quietly took off the sword and let the apprentice carry it back. He was too embarrassed to stay any longer, so he made an excuse, left without even eating dinner. When it was time for breakfast, he cheekily came to Huang's house again. Unexpectedly, he waited until noon and still didn't see any food served, which he found strange. He gave Long'er a look, calling him out, and secretly asked him:

"Why isn't dinner being served so late today? Aren't you hungry?"

"Uncle Xin, let me tell you, but don't let Mom know I told you."

"Of course, tell me quickly!" Han Xin was eager to know what was going on.

"Mom woke me up very early today, and she said, 'Long'er, get up and eat quickly, Uncle Xin is coming soon.' I thought I had slept past the time and it was already time for breakfast. After I finished washing up, it was strange that Mom brought the meal to the bed to eat. I said, 'The bed is too small, how will there be enough room for Uncle Xin to sit?' Mom smiled and said, 'You're still a child and don't understand. This isn't a place to invite Uncle Xin to eat. We're moving the meal here to mean that we don't want Uncle Xin to have any. When he comes later, don't tell him we've already eaten. Let him starve to death so he won't dare to come to our door again.' I'm afraid of Mom, so I didn't dare to speak up for you. As soon as I finished eating, I ran out to play."

Han Xin heard Long'er's words and knew that Sister-in-law Huang was determined to cut him off, so he was very angry. He endured his hunger and left without even saying goodbye to Huang, the head of the pavilion. Sister-in-law Huang also said many bad things about Han Xin to her husband, causing Huang to also hate Han Xin and no longer ask him to come back.

Han Xin couldn't make a living, so he went fishing outside the city. One day, there were many women washing cotton in the pond. They saw that Han Xin was so hungry that he could barely lift his fishing rod, and they all laughed at him for being useless. Only an old washerwoman pitied him and gave him food. She washed cotton for dozens of days and provided for Han Xin for dozens of days. Finally, Han Xin gratefully said to the washerwoman:

"I will definitely repay you greatly in the future."

"A great man who cannot feed himself is the most shameful thing in the world. I only give you food because I pity you, I don't expect you to repay me. Strive for self-reliance, begging and relying on others is not the behavior of a great man." The washerwoman sternly reprimanded Xin, which couldn't help but make him realize his mistake. From then on, he worked hard to be a better person, studying diligently and striving for goodness. Soon he became a scholar of great learning. But people at the time didn't understand him. One day, he was passing through the market in Huaiyin, and a group of hooligan youths wanted to humiliate him. The leader of the group said: "Although you are tall and big and like to carry a knife and sword, you are actually very scared inside." He spread his legs and made a riding gesture, then patted his chest and said to Xin: "If you are a brave person, please draw your knife and stab me to death, otherwise you have to crawl out from under my crotch."

Han Xin knew that his future was bright and didn't want to sacrifice himself for a pointless argument. He stared at that person for a while, then bent down, lowered his head, and crawled out from under the person's crotch. The people in the market laughed, saying that Han Xin was cowardly and useless.

Soon, the Qin Dynasty fell, and the world was in chaos. The heroes rose up one after another. The Chu general Xiang Liang crossed the Huai River, and Han Xin followed him with his sword. Liang didn't know that Xin was a virtuous man and didn't know how to use him properly. When Liang died, Xin followed Liang's nephew, Yu, who made him a courtier. Xin repeatedly proposed strategies for Yu, but Yu didn't use them. Later, when Emperor Gaozu of Han entered Shu, Xin fled from Chu and returned to Han. But he was still just a small official, and no one knew who he was. One day, a group of people committed crimes and were to be executed. Unfortunately, Xin was also among them. When they were taken to the execution ground, Xin thought he was doomed, closed his eyes, and waited for the knife to fall. One person was killed with each chop, and thirteen people were killed. When it was Xin's turn, Xin couldn't help but look up and see that the executioner was Teng Gong. In a moment of desperation, Xin asked: "Does the King of Han not want to conquer the world? Why execute brave men?"

Teng Gong saw that Xin looked heroic and could say such bold words, so he spared him from execution. Teng Gong talked to Xin and knew that he was an extraordinary person, and he liked him very much, recommending him to Gaozu. Gaozu made him the Grain Storekeeper, but he didn't appreciate him very much.

Xin talked to Prime Minister Xiao He several times, and He admired him very much. At that time, Xiang Yu's power was strong, and Gaozu's power was weak. Some generals didn't believe that Gaozu would succeed, and when they came to Nanzheng, dozens of them fled halfway. Xin saw that many people were leaving, and he couldn't help but feel moved, thinking:

"He must have introduced me to the King of Han many times. Today he still doesn't use me, and I can know that in the future, I might as well leave too."

The news of Xin's escape reached He, who didn't have time to report to Gaozu, so he personally ran to chase Xin. Gaozu didn't know the truth and was very angry when he heard that He had left, as if he had lost his right and left hands. Two days later, He returned to see Gaozu. Gaozu was both angry and happy and scolded He:

"You've also escaped?"

"I dare not escape, I went to chase an escapee."

"Who are you chasing?"

"Chasing Han Xin."

"There are more than ten escapees, you didn't chase any of them. Today you're chasing Xin, it's a lie." Gaozu scolded impolitely.

"The generals are easy to get, they can leave if they want, why chase them? As for Xin, he is a national talent, unparalleled in the world." He also replied impolitely to Gaozu, "If you only want to be the King of Hanzhong forever, then of course you don't need Xin; if you definitely want to compete for the world, then you must have Xin. But I don't know what you plan to do?"

"I plan to march east and compete for the world, how can I live here gloomily for a long time?"

"You originally intended to go east. In that case, Xin is useful, if you can use Xin, Xin will stay, if you can't use him, he will eventually leave."

"In that case, for your sake, I will use him as a general." Gaozu was still somewhat reluctant.

"Even as a general, Xin will definitely not be willing to stay."

"Then make him a great general?"

"That would be excellent!" He replied happily.

So Gaozu wanted to summon Xin to appoint him as a great general, and He said: "You have always been arrogant and rude. Today, when you appoint a great general, you're calling him over like you're calling a child, so Xin will leave. If you must appoint him, please choose a good day, fast, set up an altar, and hold the ceremony solemnly according to the grandest etiquette."

Gaozu listened entirely to He's words. The army prepared on a large scale, and everyone knew that Gaozu was going to appoint a great general, but no one knew whom he would appoint. So the generals were all happy, each thinking that they had hope of becoming a great general. Unexpectedly, when it came time to appoint the great general, it was actually Han Xin. The entire army was surprised, thinking that Gaozu had gone crazy.

After the ceremony was completed, Xin sat in the top seat, and the King of Han respectfully asked: "The Prime Minister often says that General is a genius, I don't know what instructions General has for me?"

Xin thanked him very humbly, and then asked Gaozu: "Today, you are marching east to compete for the world, is your opponent Xiang Yu?"

"Yes."

"Please estimate yourself, Your Majesty, how do your courage, strength, benevolence, and power compare to Xiang Yu?"

Gaozu thought silently for a long time before saying: "I can't compare!"

Xin quickly stood up and bowed again to congratulate him: "I also think Your Majesty can't compare. But he is not to be feared. I have also served him, and I know his character very well, please let me tell you: Xiang Yu is secretly malicious and easily angered, and he can dismiss a thousand people at will, but he cannot employ virtuous generals, this is nothing more than the courage of a common man. When Xiang Yu sees people, he is respectful and loving, and speaks with a gentle tone; when people are sick, he sheds tears and sends them food; but when people have merit and deserve to be ennobled, he carves the seal and leaves it until it is broken, he is still reluctant to give it to them, this is what is called the benevolence of a woman. Although Xiang Yu dominates the world and subjugates the feudal lords, he does not reside in Guanzhong but in Pengcheng, which violates the agreement with Emperor Yi; he ennobles his own beloved people as feudal lords, which is unfair. The feudal lords saw Xiang Yu exile Emperor Yi, and they all followed his example, turning around and exiling their own lords, seizing good land. Xiang Yu's passage is marked by destruction. The world is full of resentment, and the people do not support him. Those who temporarily obey him are only being held captive by his power. Although he is nominally a hegemon, he has actually lost the hearts of the people. That is why I say that his strength can easily turn to weakness. If Your Majesty can truly reverse what Xiang Yu has done, and use the warriors of the world, what cannot be conquered? If you use the cities and towns of the world to ennoble meritorious officials, who will not submit? If you use righteous soldiers to follow those who yearn to return east, what cannot be overcome? Moreover, the three kings of Qin were originally Qin generals, but they betrayed and surrendered to Chu, allowing Xiang Yu to deceitfully bury more than 200,000 Qin soldiers who had surrendered, and only these three traitors escaped safely. Today, they rely on Xiang Yu's support and have actually become kings of Qin. The Qin elders resent these three people, and they hate them to the bone, and no one loves them. As for Your Majesty's entry into Wuguan, you did not commit the slightest offense, you abolished the harsh laws of Qin, and you only made a three-chapter agreement with the Qin people. None of the Qin people do not wish for Your Majesty to be the King of Qin. Moreover, according to the agreement of the feudal lords, Your Majesty should be king of Guanzhong, and the people of Guanzhong all know this. Today, Your Majesty is forced to give up Guanzhong, and the people of Qin all hate it. Given the situation, if Your Majesty raises troops to march east, the three Qins can be pacified immediately with a simple proclamation."

Gaozu was very pleased after hearing Xin's words, and he deeply regretted not having met him sooner. So he listened to Xin's words, and he succeeded in capturing the three Qins without any effort. In the future, Gaozu listened and followed his advice, and in the end, he relied on Xin's intelligence to unify all of China.

It is said that after Han Xin achieved fame and success, he looked for the washerwoman to repay her kindness but couldn't find her, so he wept bitterly and threw a thousand gold coins into the washing pond as a memorial.

### Lü He Fenke (Continued) (1632-1723)

— Wu Bixiong

—The First Person to Know About Microorganisms—

How pleased Balboa must have been when he was the first European to discover the Pacific Ocean! However, this ocean was as familiar to the Indians of Central America as the Mediterranean Sea was to Balboa. Lü He Fenke's discovery of microorganisms was not like this! The situation he experienced was one that no one in the world had ever experienced; his discovery was of a living world invisible to the naked eye. They had been living and fighting with each other since ancient times, and like humans, they experienced prosperity and death, but no one had ever known anything about them. Although they are tens of millions of times smaller than humans, some of them are so harmful that they can wipe out mankind. Even venomous snakes and fierce beasts are not as terrifying as these insidious demons: they do not spare smiling infants in cradles, nor do they let go of arrogant emperors under heavy guard. Before this frenzied doorkeeper, no one in the world had ever lingered for a moment in this wonderland.

He continued to observe rainwater, and successively discovered various different microorganisms.

However, there was a question that stumped this tireless researcher. Where did those tiny, unbelievable little things in the raindrops come from? Did they fall from the sky? Did they crawl from the ground into the water? Or were they created by God?

Lü He Fenke was a devout believer in God, and his sound reason told him that "life comes from life". He thought it was too meaningless to think about things like insects falling from the sky! How to solve this mystery? Wait, there is a way: "experiment".

It was raining. Lü He Fenke took a wine glass, washed it carefully, and placed it under the outlet of the gutter under the eaves. He used his hair-thin glass tube to suck up a small drop of rainwater, and hurried to his lens. Look! There were still small creatures in the rainwater, swimming around. He initially thought that there were also microorganisms in the fresh rainwater, but then he thought again, and felt that this was not proof, they might be living in the gutter and were washed out by the rainwater.

He took a large porcelain basin, washed it clean, and braved the rain to place it on a tall box, so that the dirt on the ground would not splash into it. He poured out the rainwater that filled it for the first time, to make the basin cleaner. Then he used the tip of the tube to carefully take a small drop of rainwater, and ran to the laboratory to observe it.

"I have proved it! There is not a single creature in this water. So these microorganisms do not fall from the sky."

Did this Dutchman immediately write to the Royal Society and boast about his discovery to the world? No, he was not willing to act rashly. He took river water, ditch water, and well water to observe, and found that there were microorganisms in all of them. Only then did he feel confident.

Now he wrote a long letter to the Royal Society, telling them about his latest discovery. Some of the learned members were very skeptical of him. What! Did this Dutchman want them to believe that there were such small creatures in the world, and that a small drop of water contained more than the entire population of his country! Nonsense! The maggots in dry cheese were the smallest creatures created by God. Fortunately, some of them took Lü's report very seriously, so they asked him to explain in detail.

Lü He Fenke reported the process of his research in detail to the Royal Society. The Royal Society also conducted the same experiment based on the report, and the results showed that Lü did not lie, and his discovery was indeed a major scientific discovery, so they invited him to become a member.

This scientist, who searched everywhere like a puppy, later thought about the white filth on his teeth, what exactly was it? He scraped some off his teeth, diluted it with pure rainwater, and sucked a little with a thin glass tube. He put it under his microscope to observe. ...

Ah! There were many different small creatures inside: they displayed various comical movements. People discovered that everyone's mouth contained a zoo, who would have thought of that! If they are not expelled, they will ruin the teeth. He confirmed his theory from several friends who did not brush their teeth.

Although he had already made unique achievements in oblique science, he still worked hard to move forward. What he discovered in his long-term keen observations constantly surprised scientists. He discovered blood cells in the tail of a small fish, discovered capillaries, and saw those blood cells flowing from arteries to veins through capillaries, unintentionally confirming Harvey's theory. For his microscope, which saw everything, there was no so-called mystery, no so-called dirt, no so-called lowliness. If he were not a pragmatist and brought various interesting things into the scope of his research, we would definitely feel that the ruthless science would make people's heads ache even more, and the mysterious microorganisms would definitely be even more difficult to attract attention and even more difficult to believe.

Lü He Fenke's reputation grew day by day, and he continued to explore the secrets of that magical world. All the glory did not change his humble research attitude in the slightest. What is the reason for this? Because he already had a noble will to "seek the truth".

Lü was a very healthy old man. He liked to drink alcohol. When he got drunk, he used very hot coffee to sober up. In the process of studying microorganisms, he often discovered fresh research materials from his daily life. One day, he got drunk again, and of course drank a lot of very hot coffee. He happened to think of observing the zoo in his mouth that he had discovered earlier: he picked some dental dirt from his incisors to observe, and saw that it was full of the corpses of small creatures, and he no longer saw their activity, only one or two were still wriggling weakly, like suffering from a serious illness. It turned out that the hot coffee had killed the microorganisms on the incisors. He then observed the filth between the molars, but it was still the same as before, with many lively microorganisms still active inside. He mixed some water in. He put it on the fire and burned it very hot. All the movements of the microorganisms followed the increase in temperature. At first, the movements were sluggish, and finally they stopped. They could not survive any longer. Therefore, he was even more certain that it was the heat of the coffee that killed the microorganisms on his incisors. The fact that heating can kill microorganisms tells us about a very effective modern disinfection method.

Lü had passed the age of eighty. Although he was still healthy, his teeth began to shake; he did not complain about the inevitable phenomenon of old age. Instead, he pulled out a few bad teeth and pointed the lens at the hollow roots to study them. Friends advised him to give up his research work and rest in his old age. The old man frowned and answered his friend with burning eyes:

"The fruits that ripen in autumn are the most durable!" At the high age of eighty-five, he was only in the autumn of his life!

In 1723, this hard-working man passed away (end)

Publishing World

### Review of the Normal School Series of the Zhengzhong Book Company

— Dechang

In the past two years, the Nanjing Zhengzhong Book Company has contributed to education and academia, in addition to the monthly publication of the Education and Learning Magazine, it has also published many educational books. Among them, the following are particularly relevant to elementary education:

1. Implementation Method of Single-Grade Primary School, written by Wu Ding
2. Primary School Funding Management Method, compiled by Qiu Yexin
3. Standard Teaching Method, jointly translated by Pu Yiren and Huang Zongming
4. Practical Multi-Grade Teaching Method, compiled by Shang Yinzhuang
5. Research on Teaching Methods of Various Subjects in Lower Grades of Primary School, compiled by Zhang Gengxi, revised by Shen Zishan
6. Primary School Speaking Teaching Method, compiled by Wang Guoyuan
7. Health Education, written by Gao Jie
8. Theory and Practice of Production Education, compiled by Jiang Jinsha
9. Waste Utilization Craft Teaching Materials, compiled by Wu Wenming and Xu Jian'an
10. Primary School Teaching Aid Production Method, compiled by Ying Huaixun and Sun Yifen

Of these ten books, one and two are about administration; the Implementation Method of Single-Grade Primary School has a total of ten chapters, and all important issues such as the organization, teaching, training, and equipment of single-grade primary schools are described in detail, and many practical examples are given for easy reference. The funding problem is the fundamental problem for the implementation of primary school education, and the Primary School Funding Management Method is a special study of this practical problem. Three to six are about teaching methods. The Standard Teaching Method is a translation of the book Sxandard　Pracdiecsim　Deaching by American education scholars Baglery and Macdonald. The translation is relatively faithful and can be used as a general reference. As for multi-grade teachers, lower-grade teachers, and Chinese teachers, they can refer to the Practical Multi-Grade Teaching Method, Research on Teaching Methods of Various Subjects in Lower Grades of Primary School, and Primary School Speaking Teaching Method respectively. Seven to ten are about various important issues in primary school education. Health Education not only mentions the equipment of physical education, hygiene, and medicine, but also other health-related issues, such as teaching school building construction, are also described from the standpoint of health education. Recently, production education has moved from advocacy to implementation. The Theory and Practice of Production Education is concise and worth reading. Among the various subjects in primary school, the one that is most closely related to production education is labor. The two books, Waste Utilization Craft Teaching Materials and Primary School Teaching Aid Production Method, can be used as references. In short, these ten books are quite suitable for general primary school teachers to refer to in terms of content. However, there are slight shortcomings in terms of printing. For example, the copyright page of the Standard Teaching Method does not include the original book title and the name of the original author, making it difficult for readers to understand its source. The version of Research on Teaching Methods of Various Subjects in Lower Grades of Primary School is larger than the other volumes, making it inconvenient to carry. These need to be improved during the reprint. I think the book company will be happy to accept these small opinions.

### "Service and Self-Cultivation"

— Li Hantian

Compiled by Zhao Zongyu, published by the Commercial Press

There are two major tasks in life: self-cultivation and service. These two major tasks can also be said to be the most important in the progress of human life. Everyone hopes to cultivate a healthy person in a practical way, facing the real world; at the same time, because people are supplied by society and live in society, they should serve society in terms of morality and obligation. In short, because people cannot leave society, and society is not just one person, so it is necessary to study how to adapt to society and how to benefit society, this is self-cultivation, and the purpose of self-cultivation lies in serving society, in improving the tools of service.

The objects of self-cultivation and service are both society, not for oneself, but for society, which is the most accurate explanation. Self-cultivation and service cannot be separated and mutually affect their effectiveness. According to this point of view, practical instructions are given to seek progress. This is the spirit of the book "Service and Self-Cultivation".

"Service and Self-Cultivation" was written by Mr. Zhao Zongyu for young people working in the industry in general. The entire book contains 200,000 words and is divided into three volumes, upper, middle, and lower, and has been taught in vocational supplementary schools and other places. The first part is about moral self-cultivation, teaching people how to be a person, how to cultivate ambition, how to achieve a happy life, the methods between movement and stillness, one's own awareness and self-knowledge of strengths and weaknesses, seeking to achieve omnipotence with both hands from automatic ability, and striving for perseverance, frugality, and savings to remain unchanged, overcoming difficulties, struggling with adversity, and coping with favorable circumstances; then using self-control to study methods of dealing with people, one should use basic morals such as loyalty, forgiveness, mutual love, and compassion.

As for the moral self-cultivation of service, one should first pay attention to one's personal work and character, so that one can cultivate one's research spirit, use scientific methods, and creative instincts, and strive for cooperation through struggle and sacrifice, have a spirit of rule of law, and have a spirit of faith in one's profession, especially on the fork in the road of success or failure, one must pay attention to the exploration of time, thought, life, difficulties, criticism, opportunities, will, and morality, so as not to fall into the confusion of youth.

The second part is about seeking knowledge and physical self-cultivation. One should clearly understand the purpose and path of seeking knowledge, and at the same time require an attitude and habits of seeking knowledge, and should also determine a plan for seeking knowledge, seeking the economy of time and spirit, so for the choice of subjects, the classification of the form and utility of subjects, and the standards for selecting subjects, and at the same time for the selection of books, how to explore and learn them, how to understand them, how to memorize them, how to take notes, these are extremely important tasks. But seeking knowledge requires tools, the first tool is "seeing", "reading", "writing", and "composing", the second tool is to learn foreign languages, for the choice of foreign languages, the reading method, grammar, writing, conversation, etc.; the third tool is the source of common sense, strive to enrich it, the methods should be more visits, travel, interviews, talks, lectures, and more work, etc.

For the cultivation of ability, such as mental arithmetic and written calculation in calculation; different methods of dealing with things, objects, and people in handling affairs; speaking skills and the skills of expression and smiling; and the skills of senses and limbs, etc. Self-cultivation and service are all connected.

### How to Prepare, What to Prepare?

— Tianyu

In the Sunday Forum of this newspaper on the 21st, Mr. Ye Gongchao said in his article "The Prelude to the Anti-Japanese War II": "In the future, we will not be able to recover an inch of lost land without war, and we will not be able to save 30 million compatriots in dire straits without war." This is not just the words of Mr. Ye alone, but the words that all the people of the country want to say, and they all recognize that this sentence is a "truth" that is thousands of times true. The important question now is how to "fight"? Immediate war? Slow war? A war with preparation? Or is the national crisis imminent, and there is no room for long-term consideration and we must fight immediately? If we are preparing, what should we prepare, and how should we prepare? Mr. Ye's answer is: "Since we have identified our way out, we must think about how we can survive from now until the day of the frontal conflict; not only survive, but also prepare and build." Let's talk about the question of how to prepare and what to prepare.

Modern military strategists and politicians all agree that "modern warfare is a war of national power." The "national power" referred to here usually only includes the number of soldiers in a country, the degree of military equipment, and more importantly, combat resources, such as mineral products, food, and even transportation. But they all happen to forget a kind of greatest "national power" that can determine the final victory or defeat of the war, and that is "the power of all the people"! In the eyes of those who despise the power of the people and doubt the power of the people, saying that the power of all the people is the greatest national power that determines the final victory or defeat of the war may be considered a joke, but if we do not forget that many great changes in history have been completed with the power of the broad masses of the people, such as the success of the Northern Expedition, this fact cannot be denied. Therefore, we believe that in the situation where the enemy's high industrial technology is far different from the backward industrial level of our country, when it comes to preparation, if we only work hard on military equipment and combat resources, this is the most difficult method to be effective. The situation is very clear, we walk one mile, they walk ten miles or a hundred miles, this is really similar to the ancient saying: "Kuafu chasing the sun". Therefore, we believe that today we will not talk about preparation, if we talk about it, then the only way is to organize the people as soon as possible, train the people, and most importantly, cultivate the determination of the people to resist the enemy! Naturally, it is not to say that military preparation is not needed, but it is still secondary, at least military preparation and cultivating the power of the people to resist the enemy should be placed on the same important foundation.

And we try to recall the wars of the past January 28th, the war of Xifengkou on the Great Wall, and even the recent war of resistance in Suiyuan, every time a real war of resistance was launched, the power of the people followed the urgency and fierceness of the war of resistance and was vigorously exerted. These are all facts. We can say that the power of the people to resist the enemy, which is hidden in the whole country, is endless, and has been taught by many strange and tragic facts in the past few years, and this power is increasing and developing day by day. Now there is only one question left: how to use this power as the most powerful weapon against foreign enemies. Therefore, we believe that what needs to be prepared is to absorb the power of the people as the most powerful backing for the government against foreign enemies, and this requires bringing the potential power to the surface of society and turning it into a movement, in order to achieve this goal. We believe that the most important thing to prepare now is this.

Mr. Ye said with deep pain: "But to endure pain without a plan is only the skill of a slave." We deeply hope that every citizen can be organized to the forefront to be an anti-Japanese "warrior" and not let everyone prepare to be a "slave" in the future. This is the best way.

### In January

— Shidai

On the morning of the first day of the new year, the countryside is filled with abstract joy. Men and women, old and young, none of them are not full of joy, the streets are floating with beautiful sunlight, groups of people come and go, the brand-new clothes are obviously a new beginning that is growing. No matter if there is hatred or hatred in the past, you have to make a bow and say hello when you meet, even those who were forced to force debts yesterday, now they have to smile at each other and say: "Happy new year and get rich"—in the tile houses and thatched huts, every family has someone coming to "pay New Year's greetings". There is no distinction between "surname" and "clan" in the village, and they all have to "pay New Year's greetings" to each other. This custom inherited from ancestors of unknown years cannot be changed by anyone. In the new year, this village is harmonious and kind, and the jealousy, hatred, and disgust between people disappear completely.

Children are in groups on the street setting off firecrackers, "playing nests" (a kind of children's gambling game), and "catching up" (a kind of chasing game). Most of the semi-strong men are kicking shuttlecocks and playing "noisemakers" (i.e., gongs and drums) on the open space in front of the ancestral temple. But women are rarely seen. Except for little girls, adults cannot run on the street casually. According to ancient rules, women are not allowed to go to the street for more than three times, and they are not allowed to go to other people's houses before the sixth day of the new year. During this time, women stay at home eating, drinking, and sleeping.

From the first to the fifteenth day of the first month, quarrels will never happen in this half month. The new year is an auspicious day, and if you quarrel, you will have bad luck for a year! Naturally, there are also some people who like to drink alcohol. After getting drunk, they let people say and scold them, and sometimes the quarrel makes it impossible for other people's banquets to proceed smoothly. But this cannot cause the other party's anger. Everyone should be tolerant, patient, and avoid conflicts with others.

After the third day of the first month, the men began to "visit relatives". On the mountain roads, official roads, and roads of all sizes, there are almost all people carrying red and green packages or carrying "yuan dou baskets" (a kind of willow-woven basket with beams), coming and going. Women also freed themselves from a shackle from this day on. They dressed up neatly and prettily, and went to the ancestral hall in groups of three or five to see the "sacrificial offerings". They criticized which "sacrificial offerings" were made beautifully and which were the worst! The days always passed like river water, and the sixth day of the first month came in the blink of an eye. At this time, the "visiting relatives" stopped, and the men were busy making things for "making the Lantern Festival lively".

In particular, the women were waiting for the "Lantern Festival". At that time, officials will put on "stilt parades" and sing Yangko, there will be swings to play on, and there will be "Yellow River" strings. Everyone will try their best to dress up beautifully, who doesn't look forward to it? Even the old women with white hair are anxious to listen to Yangko. Before the tenth day of the first month, mothers encouraged their sons and daughters-in-law to beg their husbands to take the lead in organizing the "entertainment party". So the young people went out. The first thing to do is to hang the swings. In the village, they chose three or four spacious places, buried large wooden stakes, and then collected rice straw from door to door. They spread many rice straws into large thick ropes, and then they hung the swings. In one day, they hung up the "wheel swing," "hanging swing," and "dragon gate swing" with ease. The women were all attracted by the swings, and they kept playing them all day long, because it was the new year, the men would not quarrel with her, so they could be willful and free.

Then those young men who organized the Yangko entertainment party got busy! During the day, they practiced stilts on the wheat field, and at night they gathered in empty houses to rehearse the Yangko, beating gongs and drums, and rehearsing every sentence until they were familiar with it. When the "Yangko" and "stilts" were well-rehearsed, they temporarily stopped and busied themselves with making the "Yellow River". According to the rules, the "Yellow River" had to be made well by the fourteenth day, so that people could string it on the fifteenth day. The so-called "Yellow River" comes from myths and legends. In the event of a flood, the victims would flee to other provinces and counties. Although the hometown is far away from the Yellow River, sometimes they are afraid of "famine refugees" coming to harass them, so they set up the "Yellow River" on the flat ground. People can avoid disaster by stringing in it. The method of making the "Yellow River" is to bury 720 wooden stakes on a vast and flat ground, and then use grass ropes as thick as fingers to connect the wooden stakes into a winding space, leaving two "entrances" in the center of the "edge". The person who strings in enters from the entrance, and can come out from the "exit" only after stringing every space. As long as you "enter the entrance", you cannot return or turn back halfway. It is said that you will not be able to avoid a flood if you do not finish stringing. In short, the villagers create a lot of excuses to protect superstition.

"The Lantern Festival" is a night of revelry in the countryside. People are crazy and happy beyond words. The stilt parades are all dressed up in colorful costumes, stringing in the "Yellow River". At the same time, flags and umbrellas are waving, and the lights are shining brightly. The lights on each wooden stake are like stars. On the large archway at the entrance of the "Yellow River", there is a row of "revolving lanterns" hanging. The bells and drums are loud, and firecrackers are constantly ringing, and super flowers (a kind of cannon) are running in the air. The village is reveling, and the "Yellow River" has become a "world of bliss".

After stringing the "Yellow River", the stilts rest. At this time, someone stands on two layers of tables and sets off fireworks. Finally, the audience forms a large circle, and the stilt parade sings Yangko, and they don't go back until dawn.

After the "Lantern Festival", on the first day, the "Yangko Society" from other villages came to sing Yangko, and there was a Yangko Society for three consecutive days, and the countryside became lonely again.

### Street Scene

### Poet and Reality

— Ke

It snowed all day, and by evening it grew even heavier. Vehicles and horses had disappeared from the roads, and only one or two pedestrians hurried past with their heads buried in their collars. The rooftops and roads were the same, covered with white snow that smoothed out the unevenness, losing their original appearances.

Ling, with his poetic temperament, decided to find a northern-style inn to stay in. He said that staying in a Shanghai-style hotel with modern amenities like water heaters, and seeing snow scenes of roads, just wasn't authentic enough. We were already worried that so many people wouldn't fit in our small room, so of course we agreed with his suggestion. Therefore, regardless of how heavily the snow was falling, we pulled up our coat collars, left our footprints in the snow, and chatted and laughed as we went to find a northern-style inn.

We didn't walk far before we found one. The inn had a large courtyard, and the doors of the rooms opened directly onto it. There were some flowers and trees in the courtyard, and a small pond. The snow made them look especially beautiful. Along the corridor, under some small trees with lingering leaves blown in by the wind, there should have been a mule. And there should have been a woman wearing green cotton pants and a red cotton jacket tending the stove to greet us, but instead, the servant led us to a room.

The room had a cotton door curtain, the color of which was dull and faded, and it was impossible to tell what color it had originally been. There was a small stove in the center of the room, but it was unlit. All the furnishings were simple, but at the time we thought they were quaint and interesting, so we didn't say anything and settled in. We only told the servant to quickly light the stove.

The stove was lit, we took off our leather shoes and put on slippers, warmed our frozen feet by the stove, turned off the central light, and only allowed the small cabinet lamp to emit a dim light. Holding a cup of hot tea in our hands, we really felt a bit of ancient charm. Especially since the three of us sitting around the stove were all good friends who could talk about anything. Although we were already young adults in age, we were all still big kids at heart. Each of us had a bright and pure dream, but those dreams were covered with dust and grease.

Such a setting quickly made one think of "Liaozhai Zhiyi" or "Autumn Lamp Night Rain". The inn was large and old, the wind howled outside, and the light switch was too loose and located outside the door. When the wind blew, the central light, which was originally off, would flicker on. Ling, the oldest but most childish of us, was the first to shout:

"A fox spirit has come!"

Ming looked towards the door with a look of surprise and joy, saying:

"Wen, the girl in green cotton pants and a red cotton jacket that you keep talking about has come."

Such a setting was originally suitable for discussing fox spirits and ghosts, but somehow we strayed into other topics. Ling was conceiving a new play, and he wanted to write a tragicomedy about the superficial harmony and inner conflicts between him and his friends. Ming said that he still didn't have a lover and needed one, while I was reminiscing about a distant and still unrealized dream: I wanted a younger sister who was deeply experienced and worldly.

The stove fire was dying down, and there was not much coal left in the coal bucket. After throwing the last few pieces of coal into the stove, we all went to bed to avoid the cold after the fire went out.

After getting into bed, Ling, near the lamp, was reading "China's

### Anecdotes from the Opera Stage

— Respectfully Listening

Miss Fangzi is a famous singer on the opera stage. She has a gifted voice, and every time she appears on stage to sing, her "rainbow dress"-like gorgeous songs and nightingale-like singing truly captivate the audience. Especially the young Mr. Li, who admired her even more.

But once, after a performance, she returned home late at night and caught a cold. At first, she had a lot of phlegm and coughed, but later it gradually turned into a hoarse voice. She was so anxious!

The young Mr. Li, upon receiving this news, quickly bought a "bottle of Five Continents White Pine Sugar Syrup" and sent it to her. After she took it, her cough soon stopped, and her throat was no longer hoarse. When she sang again, her voice was as beautiful as before. Mr. Li's joy at gaining the favor of the beauty can be imagined.

### Streamlined Cosmetics

— Fragrant

Streamlined trains, cars, airplanes, etc., all have particularly high efficiency. It is expected that there will be many new inventions in the future that are streamlined tools. Now, there is indeed "streamlined romance," which is said to "break through the highest heat of flirting! and invent the newest posture of courtship!"

I think: Since there is "streamlined romance," there should be "streamlined cosmetics." The so-called "streamlined cosmetics" are of course particularly effective and have particularly new manufacturing methods. Just like the "San-Yi Hair Tonic" produced by Five Continents, which gives a thick and lasting fragrance to the hair. "San-Yi Perfume" has a light and elegant fragrance that intoxicates the senses. And "Yi Pin Xiang" and "Beauty Cream," etc., all have special effects of transforming ugliness into beauty, and can be called "streamlined cosmetics". They are worth recommending to men and women who love beauty.

### Constipation Harms Health

— Runzhi

We eat three meals a day and must defecate once a day to ensure that waste products in the body do not accumulate. This keeps the blood flowing smoothly and the spirit refreshed. Conversely, if residue accumulates in the intestines, it can easily produce toxins that harm health. Taking one or two (Weiling Laxative Pills) can achieve the goal of natural bowel movements. Because the pill is made from the effective ingredients extracted from plants, it is precisely effective and has no drawbacks. Each bottle of twenty pills is sold for only three dimes. The general distributor is Zhengwei Pharmacy at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Second Road. Telephone: 92525.

### Weiling Essence-Consolidating Tablets Effectively Treat Seminal Emission

— Yishou

During puberty, young people are easily induced by bad influences and commit masturbation, or engage in prostitution and excessive indulgence, all of which can contribute to seminal emission. In the early stages, it may not seem significant, but over time, the secreted fluid becomes thin, and sexual function is sharply reduced. Even during formal intercourse, premature ejaculation is inevitable, and even impotence may occur, leading to despair of reproduction. Although in the prime of youth, one ultimately becomes weak. The harm is indescribable. "Weiling Essence-Consolidating Tablets" are a special medicine with an effective treatment for seminal emission and nocturnal emission. The effect is immediately apparent after taking them, and there are no side effects. Prolonged use is not habit-forming. It is truly a safe and harmless remedy. Each bottle costs one dollar and fifty cents and is sold at Zhengwei Pharmacy on Second Road.

Northwest Corner" of China. Ming likened the character "Zi" to a shrimp. I don't know when he fell asleep. Outside the window, the wind howled, causing the window frames to shake. The electric light flickered, bringing with it an atmosphere of terror. Many thoughts were rising and falling in my mind, but I couldn't find any coherence. Just when I had a little coherence and wanted to ponder a few questions, the cold after the stove fire went out attacked us stubbornly. The thin quilt really didn't have any ability to resist.

Ling was also attacked by the cold and couldn't read his book. Ming was also frozen awake. He couldn't sleep, but it was too early to get up. The two of them tossed and turned and "shared the bed to talk" until dawn.

With great difficulty, we endured until dawn. The three of us escaped from that icebox-like room as if fleeing. The snow scenery in the courtyard was too beautiful.

Back at the hotel where our friends were staying, some of our friends who knew that we had been acting like refined gentlemen the night before asked us how many volumes of poetry we had written. I smiled and quickly slipped into bed to catch up on sleep.

The sky is clear, the wind is gentle, and the air is refreshing. Several lines of new geese fly across the sky. The busy courtier Gao Lishi is cleaning the imperial garden with great effort. The autumn scenery in the inner garden is endless, with lingering lotus in the ponds everywhere. Soon it is reported that Emperor Ming has arrived, with his favorite concubine Yang by his side. Countless osmanthus flowers fill the air with fragrance, and sometimes parrots call to each other. A royal banquet is arranged in the flower pavilion, with delicacies from the sea and mountains covering the table. Slender jade hands hold golden wine pots. The emperor sips his cup, the concubine sings, and her "rainbow dress" dance is unparalleled in the world. Taizhen kneels and offers three cups of wine, and the emperor happily takes her hand. Concubine Yang is drunk on Concubine Yang's couch, a picture of a sleeping beauty amidst crabapple blossoms, her drunken state becoming even more enchanting. Little did she know that joy was not yet complete when sorrow arrived. It is said that An Lushan rebelled and unleashed his army, directly threatening the capital. What is to be done? The great Kang dynasty has enjoyed peace for a long time, and the civil and military officials have no means to resist the enemy. Quickly order the six armies to protect the emperor, and hastily travel to Shu to temporarily avoid the flames of war. Alas, the delicate and beautiful woman, her jade shattered and fragrance extinguished, died at Mawei Slope.

"Falling Sunset and Lonely Duck"

Falling Xia suffered all the insults of her cousin Zhu Liufeng. Not only could she not resist, but she was also scolded by Zhao Chongfu and his wife.

Unable to vent her grievances, Falling Xia ran back to her room and cried bitterly. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that her life was too miserable. So she had a thought of death. While Zhao Chongfu was upstairs, she secretly ran to the old master's smoking room and took half a cup of opium. She waited until midnight to mix it with boiling water and end her life. Fortunately, when Zhao Chongfu was smoking, he noticed that the opium was a little less. He suspected that Falling Xia might be committing suicide. He hurried to Falling Xia's window to peek in and saw Falling Xia holding a bowl and preparing to take poison. Zhao Chongfu opened the door and threw the opium and bowl to the ground. Because Zhao Chongfu was afraid that Falling Xia's actions would implicate him, he sent Falling Xia to the Women and Children's Asylum the next morning.

Time passed quickly. It had been more than five months since Falling Xia entered the asylum. According to the rules of the asylum, when the girls grew up, they should take photos and hang them in the reception room so that people could see them and take them away. For other girls, taking photos was a very

### The Twentieth Century Drama Society Revives Sai Jinhua

The seven-act historical defense drama "Sai Jinhua" stirred up tens of thousands of spectators in the city after it was performed here last year. Not only in the city, but also drama fans from Suzhou and Wuxi rushed to Shanghai to see it. However, as a vanguard performance of the national defense drama movement, relying solely on local activities is not enough. It must be developed more widely. For this reason, the Twentieth Century Drama Society has put in a lot of effort and resources, rehearsing for two or three months, and will hold its first public performance at the Golden Grand Theatre at the end of the lunar year. However, at that time, it happened to coincide with the suspension of publication of various newspapers, and because the theater's deadline was too tight, many spectators were unable to attend. In view of this, the society decided to revive "Sai Jinhua" on the 27th of this month (Saturday) at the Empire Theatre at Eight Bridges. "Sai Jinhua" and the darkness of the authorities in the "Sai Jinhua" era can also be seen as reflecting the current reality.

### The Great Light Screens "Murder in the Theatre"

Frankenstein Battles Charlie Chan

Warner Oland, who is famous on the silver screen for specializing in the role of Chinese detective Charlie Chan, has been releasing Charlie Chan films one after another, and because the content of each film is different, the box office has always been strong. The great appeal is truly amazing. Now, Twentieth Century Fox has invited Frankenstein actor Boris Karloff and Warner Oland to co-star in "Murder in the Theatre" (Charlie Chan at The Opera). With these two powerhouses , of course, there is a good show to watch. The whole film is full of tension and suspense, making people shudder. The story tells of a man who was secretly murdered ten years ago and whose whereabouts are unknown. He returns to the theatre ten years later to take revenge, leading to a bizarre and headless murder case. In addition to Miloff and Warner Oland, Chinese star Lu , , also co-stars, playing Charlie Chan's son, a very important role, and his acting skills are quite good. The film will be released at the Great Light Cinema today.

### The Rich Are the Most Miserly

Tianyi's "Wealth and Prosperity" is currently being filmed intensively. There is a scene in it that depicts the miserliness of the rich. Xiao Zhengzhong is a big landlord. His daughter Zhou Meijuan asks him for money to buy fabric, and he gives her a thousand dollars. But when some fundraisers come to him to raise money for the relief of Suiyuan, he is only willing to donate one dollar, fully demonstrating his miserliness. It is truly a humorous performance.

happy thing, because there was hope of leaving the asylum. But for Falling Xia and Feng Yuru, who lived in the same room and shared the same unfortunate fate, it added to their worries. Because after the photos were hung up, there were always several people who came to see them every day. Wasn't this a troublesome thing? Especially because Yuru was interested in someone named Li, and Falling Xia was interested in Jiang Qiuwu. So the two of them often made excuses, refusing because they were ill, to see the people who came to visit.

One day, Falling Xia and Yuru were chatting about their respective concerns when Aunt Deng ran in and repeatedly asked Falling Xia to go out to meet someone. Falling Xia had no choice but to brace herself to meet the visitor. Who knew that enemies would meet on a narrow road? The person who came to see her was her former master's cousin, Zhu Liufeng.

Ever since I saw you. I began to reduce my longing. Ever since I parted from you. I have been harmed by my longing. Alas! I do not know the reason why. I have formed this karma debt with you. I have never asked your name. I do not know how far your home is. Where are you from? What kind of person are you? Are you an ordinary person, or an immortal? I am just guessing. Just guessing. Your beautiful face. Is like a peach blossom just blooming. Your soft waist. Is like a willow branch swaying. Alas! Even though I am a painter. It is difficult to depict your kind of talent. Your thin eyebrows. Are hidden by a row of bangs. Your deep eyelashes. Are surrounded by a pool of autumn water. Two dimples swirl. White teeth are revealed when you smile. When I saw you then. How could I not love you. Now that I am separated from you, how unhappy I am. These past few days. I don't want to drink tea. I am always. Confused. It is unbearable.
