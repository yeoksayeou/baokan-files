### Fall of Jiangyin, Establishment of New Defense Line in Danyang

After fierce fighting, we withdrew from Sian, while Guangde is still being firmly defended by our troops. The southern front line on the right flank is very stable.

Yesterday, due to the disruption of communications, news of the front line became increasingly scarce. Subsequently, according to various inquiries made by this newspaper, the situation obtained is recorded as follows: 
**(1)** Jiangyin is an important stronghold on the left flank of our army. Although the Japanese forces have used all their naval, land, and air forces to besiege it, our loyal and brave soldiers have resisted desperately and defended it firmly for two months, still remaining safe and sound. However, it was rumored yesterday that several points on the line from Changzhou to Jiangyin had fallen. For strategic reasons, our army began to withdraw from the Jiangyin fortress. The time was said to be around 11:00 AM on the 29th. There was once a heroic and bloody battle in the suburbs. The Japanese army completely occupied it at 3:30 PM. Battles occurred yesterday approximately one kilometer east of Changzhou East Station. Our army in the city advanced eastward to attack. Later, as the situation became tense, our army moved to defend the new defense line between Danyang and Guangde. 
**(2)** Our valiant air force has been flying to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for days, bombing Japanese warships. In the area of Changyinsha for about fifty miles, Japanese warships were either damaged or sunk, with considerable losses. 
**(3)** The two armies in Yixing in the central sector are engaged in fierce and bloody battles. The city has been subjected to devastating bombings. The Japanese troops invading Yixing are advancing northward from Jiapu and landing from Wuxi, attempting to attack the east gate of Yixing via Tangdu. However, we have built solid defenses to the west of Yixing. Even if the city walls are breached, the Japanese army will probably not be able to invade easily to the west. 
**(4)** Guangde is indeed being firmly defended by our army. After the Japanese army reached Changming Village and Wangpo Town, there was a tendency to divide their forces and invade Lishui and Jurong to the north. The terrain there is higher, with many overlapping hills and mountains, making it easy to defend. 
**(5)** It is widely rumored that a part of the Japanese army landed at Wengjiabu yesterday and is urgently advancing on Hangzhou along the coastal seawall. However, as of 2:00 AM this morning, there is no confirmed report, making it difficult to verify. The Japanese army's previous westward advance from Wuxing was intended to spy on Nanjing. Many Japanese planes bombed Xuancheng on the 30th, causing little damage. This move seemed to be a prelude to a westward invasion. Furthermore, our southern front on the right flank, firmly defending the Haining, Chongde, and Jingshan defense line, is very stable. The Japanese army has not attacked in the past two days. On the 30th, 2,000 Japanese soldiers landed in the Ganpu area and headed towards Jiaxing. The Japanese army on the right flank used its main force to attack Sian Town, 25 kilometers east of Guangde. At 2:00 PM on the 28th, more than 5,000 Japanese soldiers, mostly mechanized units, launched a fierce attack from the northeast, with more than ten aircraft covering their advance. Our certain units immediately resisted fiercely, fighting until 7:00 PM. Finally, due to excessive losses, they withdrew from Sian and have now deployed a new defense line between Sian and Guangde.

News from Hangzhou: 
**(1)** Our army on the southern right flank received instructions from the supreme military authorities on appropriate measures and has successively replenished troops. In addition, the front-line deployment by a certain commander-in-chief greatly boosted morale. There is no trace of the Japanese army in the Haiyan and Chepu areas. Two-thirds of the residents have already moved back to live in peace. 
**(2)** The central government appointed Huang Shaoxiong to take charge of Zhejiang's administration again, which greatly pleased the people of Zhejiang. The provincial government is preparing for the handover. 
**(3)** On the 29th, the Japanese army built fortifications fifteen li south of Wuxing County. 
**(4)** A small part of the Japanese army, ambushed by our forces on the left and right flanks, fled to Sian. Our army is in pursuit.

### All Plainclothes Troops in Lishui Eliminated

On the morning of the 28th (around 3:00 AM), dozens of Japanese plainclothes troops were discovered near Lishui, making noise and acting recklessly. They were surrounded and attacked by our defending troops and all were eliminated.

Foreign sources report this morning at 10:00 AM that after Japanese troops in Changxing attacked Changming Village and Wangpo Town in Guangde, they now have a tendency to divide their forces and invade Lishui and Jurong to the north. There are many mountain roads between Guangde and Xuancheng, and we are prepared. Therefore, they are advancing along the highway route. (Huadong News Agency)

### Fierce Battle at Huashu Town, Jiangyin

After the Japanese captured Wuxi, part of our army moved to Changzhou and part moved to Huashu Town, Jiangyin, relying on the natural defenses of Longsha Mountain, Turtle Mountain, and Tianxian to defend fiercely. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting. The two regiments of Tao Fengwei and Xu Junru, who defended the city alone in Wuxing, were under attack by Japanese troops because Tao was unwilling to take the position of Chairman of the Huzhou Maintenance Association and the American missionary was unable to mediate. Regiment Commander Xu was wounded by shrapnel in the county government. Tao's younger brother, Jianfang, led more than a thousand soldiers from the outskirts of the east gate to attack the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered many casualties. Later, in order to preserve their strength, they reluctantly led their troops away from Huzhou City and headed to Xiaofeng County to defend it for a long time. The missionary also left the city for Hangzhou. The situation in Huzhou City is now extremely chaotic. (Huadong News Agency)

### Establishment of Maintenance Association in Chuansha

Mr. Dong, a resident of Chuansha, came to Shanghai yesterday afternoon (30th) and said that after the fall of Pudong, Japanese troops had patrolled the area of Chuansha County for a week but did not station there. Later, teams of three or four or five or six also came here from time to time to patrol. Now a puppet organization maintenance association has been established in Chuansha, presided over by Zhang Siwei, a local resident. Since the outbreak of the war, seven or eight out of ten residents have already moved away. Now, as order gradually returns, many have moved back. The market is also gradually recovering. Most of the shops have reopened, but only for two or three hours, opening from 8:00 or 9:00 AM to about 11:00 AM, and then closing. Other larger shops have not yet reopened. The post office and the Farmers Bank are still not in operation. Robberies are still heard from time to time inside and outside the city. This week, the Qiu Dingshun Rice Mill outside the West Gate and the Xi Liangji Herbal Medicine Shop inside the West Gate were robbed, suffering heavy losses. There is no trace of the Japanese army in various towns in the four rural areas of Chuansha, such as Sanwang Temple, Panjia Bridge, Yaojia Port, Dawan, Xiaowan, Caijia Road, Xiaoyingfang, Jiangjia Road, Zhujia Bridge, and Jinjia Bridge. Market order is the same as in the city. Transportation has not yet recovered. The ships that normally sail to various ports have not yet started. Although the small trains from Chuansha to Zhujia Bridge and Jinjia Bridge are now running, the number of trips is less than usual. Chuansha's food supply usually comes from Changshu and other places. Now, due to the interruption of transportation, there is also a severe shortage of food. The prices of vegetables and various foods are also gradually soaring, and the residents' lives are also very difficult.

It has been a month since our army withdrew from Shanghai, but the great fire in Nanshi has continued to rage. Although there was a week of heavy rain in between, it failed to extinguish the flames even slightly. Houses and property have been completely destroyed. Father Rao, a Frenchman, recently traveled from Shanghai to Songjiang. According to Rao, Songjiang City has been turned into a field of rubble, and the situation is miserable.

### Japanese Marines Fill Defense in Pudong

After more than 200 Japanese troops stationed in the Pudong area were ordered to be transferred to the front line for combat a few days ago, the defense left behind was taken over by the Japanese side in two groups on the evening of the same day at 5:00 PM and yesterday morning at 6:00 AM. Hundreds of naval marines in dark blue woolen uniforms landed from the Rihua Cotton Mill and Tianzhang Paper Mill in Lujiazui and went to take over the defense. These marines are stationed in the Lujiazui, Laiyidu, Yangjiadu, and Tangqiao areas. The headquarters is still located in the Tianzhang Paper Mill.

Although the Japanese army has made considerable progress on the Eastern battlefield recently, it is still not optimistic about the future of the war. Therefore, reinforcements are constantly arriving. A certain division of its most elite troops is said to have arrived in Shanghai.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Inspects Capital's Defenses

Obstacles Placed at Key Points, Public Buses Stop Running

[Nanjing] As Japanese troops gradually advance towards the capital, the city has been transformed into a large military camp, preparing for defense. Streets at key points are now being built with barbed wire obstacles, and trenches are being dug outside the city, with other defensive works being deployed. The main gates of the capital are still open, but the two smaller gates have been closed today. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek inspected the defenses around the city today. Reuters later learned from responsible parties that Chiang was very satisfied after the inspection. Madame Chiang also remains in the city. This morning, a Reuters reporter toured the entire city and saw many poor people still staying in the city, because these people are extremely poor and unable to move elsewhere. The Safety Zone Committee is now preparing to establish shelters so that these people can be moved there when war breaks out in the capital. The committee has made this suggestion to the Japanese authorities, but has not yet received a response. Public buses have now stopped running, but other public services are still maintained as usual. According to Mayor Ma, electricity, tap water, and telephones will be maintained until the machines are damaged. The postal service is completely normal, and the five post offices in the city are still busy collecting and sending mail every day.

### Italian Recognition of Manchukuo Harmful to Sino-Italian Relations

Gives Major Stimulus to Our People, Heard That Liu Wendao Has Lodged a Protest

Regarding the Haitong News Agency report that the Italian government announced its recognition of the Manchukuo puppet organization and intends to send a minister to Changchun soon, reports received from relevant parties have now confirmed that this news has given the Chinese people a major stimulus. The Manchukuo puppet organization has long been resolved by the League of Nations not to be recognized. Sino-Italian relations have always been cordial. For many years, Italy has been able to take consistent steps with other countries on the principle of non-recognition. Now, it has suddenly abandoned this solemn position, formally recognized the puppet state, violated the League of Nations resolution, and disregarded Sino-Italian relations, which cannot be considered less than regrettable and makes those who have always advocated pro-Italian relations feel greatly disappointed. It is heard that our ambassador to Italy, Liu Wendao, has lodged a protest with the Italian Foreign Ministry.

### West Shanghai Designated as Special Alert Zone

From Zhenru to Hongqiao, Xietu Road to Caojing, Traffic is Temporarily Difficult to Restore, Foreigners are Generally Prohibited from Passing

Since the change in the war situation and the fall of the Zhabei district, traffic in West Shanghai has been completely cut off. At that time, the villagers in the western district fled in panic, most of them alone. Those who fled into the refugee areas were able to receive relief from the International Relief Committee and other charitable organizations, barely making a living. A portion who did not enter the refugee areas temporarily had relatives and friends to rely on, but as time went on, it became difficult to maintain. Therefore, in recent days, many have gathered in the Xujiahui area, waiting for an opportunity to return home. Now, we have obtained reliable information from a certain foreigner, stating that West Shanghai, from Zhenru to Hongqiao and from Xietu Road to Caojing, has been designated as a special alert zone. Therefore, people are not allowed to stay in all the above-mentioned areas. Even foreign manufacturers in the area who intend to explore and apply for a pass from the Japanese headquarters are not allowed. Therefore, the restoration of traffic in West Shanghai is still indefinite.

### Obstacles Along Suzhou Creek Removed

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war on August 13th, the concession authorities, in order to maintain order within the concession, specially installed barbed wire and sandbag obstacles along the south bank of Suzhou Creek.

Yesterday, the demolition had reached the Xinzha Bridge in the Public Concession from the Bund on Beijing Road.

### Various Parties Seek to Restore Telecommunications Traffic

Inconvenience Felt by Both Chinese and Foreign Businesses, Restoration Expected in the Short Term

After the Shanghai telecommunications agencies under our Ministry of Communications were taken over by the Japanese on the 28th, telecommunications traffic between this city and the country has been interrupted for more than thirty hours. The domestic lines of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Three Waters Line Telegraph Companies also only receive from Guilin and Guangdong provinces, relayed through Hong Kong, with double the telegraph fees. If the mainland wants to forward from Hong Kong, the process is extremely complicated. Both Chinese and foreign businesses in this city feel quite inconvenienced by this. It is now heard that the telecommunications authorities are planning measures to enable telecommunications to function as usual. At the same time, foreign merchants also feel a great need for this and are actively discussing it. If there are no obstacles, telegrams between this city and foreign ports are expected to be restored in the short term.

Also, after the Japanese side sent personnel to take over the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, the employees of the Telegraph Bureau have stopped working, and there is no one in the Bureau, but the personnel sent by the Japanese side are still stationed inside. Yesterday, the Japanese side suddenly moved two telegraph machines from the Telegraph Bureau on Jing'an Temple Road. It is said that the British police stationed there tried to stop them, but ultimately failed.

### Peaceful Situation in Minhang

Minhang Town in Southern Shanghai, after our army withdrew from the Shanghai western front, the town was once in a state of chaos. Afterwards, transportation was blocked, and news was mixed. Now, someone who has just come to Shanghai from the town by an indirect route says that Minhang was contacted a week ago by Tang Guqiao, the former head of the opera troupe, who came forward to negotiate and set up a temporary maintenance office, which is very strict in its management of local defense. Therefore, there are few cases of robbery and other incidents. At present, shops selling daily necessities in the town have opened for business, but only about ten percent of the residents have fled, the streets are deserted, and the scene is miserable. A few days ago, the office sent people to Shanghai due to a lack of staff. It is now known that Wang and others, who are familiar with criminal and political affairs, have been found and went to Minhang yesterday to assist in everything.

### Japanese Warships Attack Jiangyin Blockade Line on Langshan River

Japanese Vehicles Also Fiercely Attack Jiangyin from Liuhai Sha, Report of Artillery War on Langshan Side is Not Accurate

Nantong correspondence, on the 24th, more and more Japanese warships arrived on the Langshan River near Nantong. There are a total of 76 ships docked from Niuhong Port to Liuhai Sha. A giant ship sailed to Tiansheng Port and spied on the shore for a long time, then returned to Shenhong. The ships on the Liuhai Sha River fired continuously at the sandbar from morning to evening. In recent days, most of the gunboats have also sailed up the river from Nantong, attempting to destroy the Jiangyin Fortress area blockade line. The Jiangyin side has recently strengthened its defensive works by our military authorities. It is now winter, and the Yangtze River usually recedes, but recently the tides have been particularly high. Ships have now been sunk again in the river between Cheng and Jing to strengthen the blockade.

Large numbers of Japanese aircraft have flown to Nantong in recent days, spying on the area along the river for a long time. Local defenses are solid, and the situation is peaceful. Also, since the fall of Suzhou and Changshu, Japanese warships have gathered in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the Tongzhou section, and have joined with the Japanese Air Force to fiercely attack the Jiangyin Fortress. Japanese transport ships are especially busy on the Tong-Hu route, moving frequently to the blockade line on the river between Jiangyin and Jingjiang. The sound of artillery from the Jiangyin side can also be heard in Tongcheng, especially at night. Nantong is located in the rear of Jiangbei. In recent weeks, Japanese warships have not taken any action against this area. The troops stationed on the Langshan side have also not fired artillery or attacked the Japanese warships in conjunction with the south bank. The rumor that a naval battle took place in Langshan that is spreading in Shanghai is not true. As for Liuhai Sha, it has indeed fallen. The sha is also known as Changyin Sha. It is a sandbar that emerges from the river. It has been jointly managed by Nantong, Changshu, and Jiangyin counties due to enclosure. The northeastern part belongs to Nantong and is listed as the Fifth District. On the 25th, the Fifth District Chief Jin Ding transported the documents, firearms, and equipment of the district office across the river from Jiangyin to Jingjiang and then to Tong. The southwestern part of Changyin Sha has been connected to Jiangyin and Changshu in recent years. Therefore, after the Japanese troops landed there, they attacked Jiangyin westward and are now engaged in fierce fighting. British and American merchant ships sail between Nantong and Shanghai every day, transporting passengers and cargo. Passengers coming from Shanghai to Tongzhou to transfer to various ports along the Yangtze River are extremely crowded. Refugees in Nantong are being accommodated in various institutions set up by various charitable organizations. In recent days, more than 7,000 people have been transferred to Taizhou, Gaobao, and Xingdong.

### Essays at Random from Lieshan

— Feng Lieshan

A Boy and a Master

In England, waiters are called "attendants," but in the colonies, the English word is "boy." "Boy" is a transliteration, and its intended meaning is very close to the words "little slave."

According to Chinese workers, although the attitude of foreigners towards Chinese people has changed a lot in recent years, the word "boy" has never changed. When Englishmen first come to the Far East, they still use the term "attendant" when boarding the ship, but after two or three days, it always becomes "boy." Everyone feels angry, but survival is more important than everything else!

The situation on the ship this time was the same. "Boy" here, "boy" there, it really makes people feel uncomfortable. One Englishman even felt that the English proficiency of this group of "boys" was not good enough. He said, "Are these people fit to be boys?" I said, "If their English proficiency is good enough, wouldn't they be able to become compradors?" He was silent.

On the ship, a fat lady called "boy" the loudest. One day, the following story happened:

"Boy," the fat lady said, "Where is the master?"

A Chinese worker named Zhou couldn't bear her tone. The so-called "master" was her husband, who had the air of a scholar. In her eyes, her husband was the master of this group of "boys," so there was no need to say "her husband" or "Mr. So-and-so."

"Madam," the worker named Zhou asked, "Do you want mustard?"

It turned out that "Master" and "Mustard" really sounded the same in the pidgin English pronunciation.

"Yes!" the fat lady said, "Hurry up, I'm waiting!"

After a while, the worker named Zhou brought the mustard and put it on her blanket, then shouted loudly towards the door: "Madam, the mustard is here."

The fat lady rushed into the room: "Where is the master?" But she couldn't see her husband.

The worker named Zhou pointed upstairs: "Madam, isn't this the mustard?" He spoke calmly and didn't laugh.

The fat lady said anxiously, "No, no, not this!" At the same time, she knew that this Chinese worker was making fun of her.

The worker named Zhou still said politely, "Madam, besides this, there is no other 'Master' on the ship!"

The fat lady shook her head and couldn't say a word.

The reporter told this story to the English passengers on the ship, and everyone burst into laughter. Especially a Chinese lady who married an Englishman, for several days, as soon as she saw the fat lady, she couldn't help but laugh out loud.

Little Fatty and His Chinese Wife

Little Fatty is the English husband of this Chinese lady, an employee of a certain organization in the Far East. The name "Little Fatty" was given to him by his Chinese wife, but in fact, his weight is around two hundred pounds.

Little Fatty is sympathetic to China, probably as a result of being moved by his wife. In many places, he often disagreed with other English passengers. In the eyes of this group of Englishmen, at least he has become half Chinese."

Life at sea is monotonous. After two or three weeks, even Englishmen who don't usually like to talk started talking. Everyone started by talking about the weather, and then, they talked about everything.

Ordinary Europeans have a habit of asking you if you like their country. At the same time, the answer they expect is "yes." If you can say a few more nice words, of course they will be even happier. But our little fatty's Chinese wife is not a spineless person.

An Englishman working for a certain company in Hong Kong - hereinafter referred to as Mr. Hong Kong - asked this Chinese lady whether she liked London or Shanghai. The Chinese lady answered very directly, saying that she liked Shanghai.

"Oh," Mr. Hong Kong felt embarrassed, "You don't like England?" He said this almost pleadingly.

"No," the Chinese lady replied in a very firm tone, "I like China."

Mr. Hong Kong was silent. But his wife was not convinced. Mrs. Hong Kong is a person who always likes to get the upper hand. She is quite presentable, laughs loudly when she talks, and doesn't get up until after ten o'clock in the morning. More importantly, she is the social center of this ship.

"But," Mrs. Hong Kong said somewhat angrily, "China is very dirty!"

"Speaking of cleanliness," Little Fatty still had a smile on his face, "There are indeed many places in our England that are not clean enough." At the same time, he cited several place names.

Mrs. Hong Kong was a little angry. She asked Little Fatty, "What is the system of the Chinese officialdom? Bribery, selfishness, which country in the world is so dark..."

Little Fatty still had his usual leisurely attitude. He said, "It's not just China, even our England can't avoid it sometimes. For example, wasn't the dismissal of a certain high official in the past also due to bribery?" In addition to saying the name of a certain high official, Little Fatty also described the course of the case.

"Oh," Mr. Hong Kong said, "In the past, we only regarded it as a mystery, so that's how it was!"

Mrs. Hong Kong blushed. She was probably angry at Little Fatty's "betrayal" and stood up and walked away without saying a word.

Later, the reporter said to Little Fatty's Chinese wife, "This is worth congratulating. After you married a foreigner, you have become even more of a genuine Chinese."

She replied, "Although Little Fatty treats me very well, I think it's better for Chinese people to marry Chinese people."

### Anglo-French Conference Successfully Concludes: Resolves to Fulfill Treaty Obligations in the Far East

Comprehensive Discussion of All European Issues - France Understands the Results of the British Lord Privy Seal's Visit to Germany

[London] Following talks between British and French authorities, a communique has been issued stating that, regarding the Far East, both parties are willing to cooperate with other nations to safeguard existing interests and fulfill obligations stipulated by international treaties. (Havas Urgent Telegram, 1:30 AM)

[London] A communique was released today following the conclusion of the Anglo-French conference, stating that after hearing a report from British Lord Privy Seal Halifax on his talks in Germany, the French Premier and others gratefully acknowledged that although Halifax's trip was of a private nature and might not immediately yield any results, it was helpful in dispelling international misunderstandings and improving the atmosphere. The entire range of European issues, as well as prospects for friendly relations and disarmament, were discussed. British and French cabinet members found new evidence of shared Anglo-French stances that could characterize the two nations' future. Regarding colonial issues, a preliminary study of various points was undertaken, and it was generally felt that these issues could not be considered in isolation and would require long-term review. French Foreign Minister Delbos will visit certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and the shared interest of Britain and France in maintaining peace in Central and Eastern Europe was gladly noted. Regarding non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, both parties recognized that the policies pursued by Britain and France were entirely justified and resolved to continue proceeding with these policies. British and French cabinet members also studied the overall situation in the Far East, fully acknowledging its significance. Both parties agreed to prepare to cooperate with major powers in a similar position to protect rights and address all obligations arising from international treaties in that part of the world. Both parties also discussed other international affairs of mutual interest in a spirit of mutual trust. The communique concluded by stating that neither country would abandon its previously declared concept of international cooperation and reiterated its desire to cooperate with other nations to promote international stability through free and peaceful negotiations. Chautemps and Delbos departed from London for their respective countries at 4:30 PM, and Chamberlain and Eden saw them off at the station. (Reuters, 30th)

[London] The Anglo-French conference concluded today, and a joint declaration will be released this afternoon, describing the results of the conference and, in a circumspect manner, inviting German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to cooperate in finding a final new resolution to various European problems. (National Telegram, 30th)

[London] French Premier Chautemps, Foreign Minister Delbos, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Foreign Secretary Eden continued their meeting this morning, discussing the overall global situation for two hours. The French Premier and others then proceeded to Buckingham Palace to accept an invitation from the King of England. British Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Cranborne and French Ambassador Corbin were also in attendance. It is understood that cooperation between the two major democracies has indeed been strengthened as a result of these talks, and it is hoped that the positive work begun here can be extended to all parts of Europe. Chautemps and Delbos are scheduled to depart for their respective countries around 4:30 PM today. (Reuters, 30th)

[London] French Premier Chautemps, Foreign Minister Delbos, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Lord Privy Seal Halifax held talks yesterday at 10 Downing Street. The situation in the Far East was one of many issues discussed. According to a communique, both parties acknowledged the seriousness of the situation in the Far East and the need to earnestly safeguard interests. It is reported that the first day of talks was highly successful. After the meeting, French Premier Chautemps smiled and told people, "We only went outside after reaching unanimous agreement." The scope of yesterday's meeting was quite broad, beginning with a detailed report from British Lord Privy Seal Halifax on his recent impressions of his visit to Germany. French dignitaries apparently fully understood the scope of Halifax's talks in Berlin. The colonial issue was then discussed, and both parties felt that this issue required long-term study. Subsequently, the situation of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia's Little Entente was discussed, so that French Foreign Minister Delbos could visit Warsaw on Thursday. Both parties discussed the status of the countries that the French Foreign Minister planned to visit, believing that the peace of these countries was something that both Britain and France were willing to maintain, with concern no less than that of other countries. As for the Spanish situation, both parties believed that the non-intervention policy had been implemented. After the first day of meetings, French Premier Chautemps expressed his pleasure to Reuters reporters, believing that the complete unity of the two governments had been demonstrated by this meeting. The French Premier was unwilling to announce the content of the talks, but said that the meeting would continue today, and a communique could be released in the afternoon, with work expected to be completed before noon. It is widely believed that both parties clearly expressed their desire for greater cooperation from all countries, but that greater preparatory work was needed before genuine negotiations could be implemented.

### German and Italian Attitudes Remain Reserved Regarding Anglo-French Official Talks

[Berlin] Regarding the talks conducted by British and French officials, German semi-official sources have largely remained silent, stating only that Germany's views have been repeatedly explained in the past, and that Germany's legitimate demands are not subject to time constraints, so Germany will refuse to participate in any bargaining. (Havas Telegram, 28th)

[Rome] Italian newspapers are paying close attention to the talks being held in London by British and French dignitaries, but they are mostly taking a reserved stance and have not issued comments. However, they unanimously believe that the Anglo-French talks in London will be followed by Anglo-German and Anglo-Italian talks, and they have expressed a welcome for this. (Havas Telegram, 30th)

[London] French Prime Minister Chautemps, Foreign Minister Delbos, and Ambassador Corbin to England recently visited the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in the morning of this month, and held talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Sir Vansittart, and the Director of the Central European Affairs Department of the Foreign Office, Sterling. British Privy Counselor Lord Halifax was also in attendance. At noon, Prime Minister Chamberlain hosted a banquet for the French dignitaries, and invited Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Simon, Privy Counselor Lord Halifax, Foreign Secretary Eden, Minister for Coordination of Defense Inskip, and Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Sir Vansittart to attend as well. Conversations continued without interruption during the banquet. After the banquet, talks continued and ended at 6:20 PM. A final meeting will be held at 11:00 AM tomorrow, and a formal communique will be issued. Prime Minister Chautemps recently met with reporters at the French Embassy and issued a statement, saying, "The attitude adopted by the British and French governments is united and satisfactory. However, I am unable to tell you the details of the talks. What I can tell you is that we and the British cabinet members are in complete agreement on all issues." (Havas Telegram, 29th)

[London] Regarding the Anglo-French talks, it is reported that the discussion this morning focused on the recent visit to Germany by British Privy Counselor Lord Halifax. The Lord Privy Seal gave a personal report on the discussions with the German leader Hitler. By noon, British and French cabinet members had a meal together, and after the meal, they continued the talks. British Prime Minister Chamberlain also exchanged personal views with French Prime Minister Chautemps for a long time. The content of the Anglo-French talks is currently being kept secret by both sides, and a portion of it will only be revealed after a formal communique is released tomorrow afternoon and British cabinet members make a declaration in Parliament. According to well-informed sources here, the results that can be obtained from the Anglo-French talks include seven items:

㊀ Both parties will issue a joint statement, based on the information obtained by Lord Halifax from Germany, and will continue to make efforts to improve the diplomatic situation.

㊁ Both parties recognize that negotiations between Britain and France, with the full agreement of Germany, are beneficial.

㊂ Regarding the demands made by Germany, i.e., the demand that Germany be recognized in principle to have the right to recover its former colonies, Britain and France do not reject it.

㊃ Regarding this issue, Britain and France will consult with all parties concerned when necessary.

㊄ Germany's above-mentioned demands will only be implemented after a general solution to the European situation has been established.

㊅ Britain and France are willing to immediately consider whether a tariff system can be established in their respective colonies so that Germany's difficulty in obtaining raw materials, which the country claims is due to a lack of colonies, can be resolved. Regarding this, Britain and France plan to organize companies in certain colonies in Africa for development and to supply certain raw materials to Germany.

㊅ Regarding the European situation, Britain and France will not take any action to encourage or promote changes to the current situation. In general, the talks currently being conducted by Britain and France are only the beginning of future negotiations. These negotiations will not be concluded until after several months. (Havas, 29th)

[London] Regarding the talks conducted by British and French officials, diplomatic sources here recently declared, "The talks were extremely satisfactory and unprecedented." It is reported that during today's meeting, the parties discussed ㊀ the situation in the Far East, ㊁ the issue of Germany's recovery of its former colonies, ㊂ Central European issues, and ㊃ the Spanish civil war. Regarding the first item, British and French officials both agreed that the situation in the Far East was extremely serious and that joint interests held by each country in the Far East should be maintained. Regarding the second item, British Privy Counselor Lord Halifax gave a detailed report on the impressions he obtained during his visit to Germany. British and French officials both believed that this was a major issue that must be considered over the long term. According to sources close to the British cabinet, the demands made by German leader Hitler to Lord Halifax were very clear, i.e., Germany demanded the restoration of the two colonies of Togoland and Cameroon and the delegation of the rule of the Belgian Congo and Portuguese Angola to Germany. As for Tanganyika, formerly a German colony, which is ruled by Britain, and other former German colonies ruled by various countries, such as the islands in the Pacific, Germany does not demand their recovery. Regarding the third item, Britain's current policy has no intention of changing, but it believes that the treatment of German minorities in Central European countries can be improved within the scope of maintaining current borders. Regarding the fourth item, British and French officials both believe that the current policy of non-intervention must be maintained. (Havas Telegram, 29th)

[London] During today's meeting of the Lower House, many members questioned the government about the possible consequences of Anglo-German and Anglo-French talks. Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne replied briefly, "Britain will continue to abide by Article 20 of the League of Nations Covenant." In addition, Lord Cranborne also declared that Britain does not intend to continue sending cabinet members to visit foreign countries or invite foreign officials to come to Britain. Regarding the Austrian issue, when asked whether British policy would maintain the country's political independence and territorial integrity, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon replied, "Regarding this issue, Foreign Secretary Eden has previously issued a statement and provided an explanation. There is nothing else to report." (Central News Agency, Havas Telegram, 29th)

### British King Hosts Banquet for French Dignitaries in Palace

[London] King George VI recently held a banquet at 1:15 PM today, accompanied by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden and his wife, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne and his wife, and French Ambassador to England Corbin. (Havas Telegram, 30th)

### Colonial Issue

The Principle of Returning Colonies to Germany is Largely Decided, But Implementation Must Wait Until a General Solution to the European Situation is Found

[London] Regarding the progress of the talks conducted by British and French officials, a Havas News Agency interviewer recently learned from responsible sources that the opinions of both parties are in complete agreement. The first issue submitted for discussion was the colonial issue. Regarding this, former German Economics Minister Schacht expressed his views in Paris in May, believing that the return of former colonies to Germany should be sought within the overall resolution of European issues. The views of Britain and France are now the same. Regarding Central European issues, Britain and France will not give Germany the right to act freely, but will continue to conduct negotiations through diplomatic channels to seek an appropriate solution. (Havas Telegram, 30th)

[London] Regarding the issue of Germany recovering its former colonies, British military sources recently declared that Tanganyika, formerly a German colony in Africa, which is currently ruled by Britain, must be kept by Britain no matter what, because Tanganyika is located in central Africa and is a major transportation route for the British Empire. British ships, which travel from the country to India, must bypass the port of Cape Town in South Africa if they cannot take the Mediterranean route. Therefore, the ports of Tanganyika are the most suitable locations for anchorage. In addition, aircraft belonging to British Imperial Airways, which travel between London and the port of Cape Town, also use Tanganyika as a major base. According to unconfirmed reports, Germany has expressed its acceptance of this British view and will therefore not demand the recovery of Tanganyika. In addition, Southwest Africa, formerly a German colony, is ruled by the South African Federation. People from the Federation recently declared that although the return of Southwest Africa to Germany is worthy of consideration, the only former German colonies in Africa that can be returned to Germany in the future are Togoland and Cameroon. (Havas Telegram, 29th)

### Anglo-Portuguese Liaison

The Portuguese capital's Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a communique stating that both Britain and Portugal are willing to maintain good relations and have them enhanced.

### The Cili Society's Members are Instructed to Uphold Integrity

Inspire Conscience to Save Others and Save Oneself

The Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Disaster Relief Committee for War-Torn Refugees recently discovered that the Director of the Xinheng Shelter, Li Rensheng, and the Director of the Hengfeng Shelter, Gao Shuqing, illegally embezzled relief supplies for refugees. The court has severely punished them for their deserved crimes. The committee is again advising its staff to work diligently, honestly, and with integrity to achieve the goal of saving others and saving themselves. The following is an excerpt from its circular: To all concerned, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, this committee has established various refugee shelters. Most of the staff were recommended and claimed that at this time of national crisis, with bullets flying and lives hanging by a thread, saving others is saving oneself. There is no one who does not inspire conscience and work diligently. Unexpectedly, Li Rensheng of the Xinheng Shelter and Gao Shuqing of the Hengfeng Shelter have committed illegal embezzlement. The court has already ruled and punished them for their deserved crimes. But their wickedness and insanity have reached this point, which is regrettable. Think about the refugees in the war zone, who originally had homes and fields, and lived peacefully. In an instant, their families were destroyed and their lives were lost. We, although in the midst of hardship, are still in the position of saviors and should cultivate virtue and accumulate merit in the hope of ultimately receiving great blessings. But they do not know how to cherish themselves and are willing to fall into hell. This is regrettable. The relief funds of this committee rely entirely on donations. Everyone is enthusiastically donating for the sake of the refugees. If the reputation of the entire committee is affected by the embezzlement of one or two people, the source of donations will be cut off, and the tens of thousands of refugees in the shelters will only be able to wait for death. This is regrettable. The bombs and guns of the Japanese are nothing more than attempts to kill people. Embezzling relief food will also cause refugees to starve to death. What is the difference between dying of starvation and dying from bombs and guns? This is regrettable. European and American countries are helping our country's refugees, either by donating money or helping with medicine. Recently, organizations in the concession areas and the British and French Municipal Councils have donated rice, all in the name of humanitarianism. Fellow countrymen are using their positions as saviors to release the means of killing. This is regrettable. Moreover, the law emphasizes facts, while cause and effect depend on conscience. If there are opportunities to exploit positions for personal gain, even if the facts are covered up and not exposed, it is difficult to question conscience. As the saying goes, "One can enter the government office, but not the temple gate." Retribution is clear and will ultimately not fail. A great calamity is approaching, and the national crisis is not over. The overturned cart in front is a warning to the cart behind. All of us, let us encourage each other.

### Each-Daily-Penny Donation Movement Gains Enthusiastic Support from All Sectors

### Investigation of Various Shelters in This City

The Poor Are Destitute, The Number of Refugees Will Increase

Since the outbreak of the war, refugees have flocked to this city. Various charitable organizations and groups have been engaged in providing shelter and relief. Except for some hometown associations that have completed their work, most are still working as usual. Moreover, with the arrival of severe winter, there is a tendency for them to continue to increase. According to the investigation by the reporter of the New Sound Society, ㊀ the International Relief Committee has four shelters in the French Concession, one in the International Settlement, and 104 in the refugee area of the Nantao district; ㊁ the Relief of War Zone Refugees Committee of the Joint Relief Association of Charitable Organizations has eight in the French Concession and 42 in the International Settlement; ㊂ the Cilian Relief Branch has 17 in the French Concession and 78 in the International Settlement; ㊃ the Red Swastika Society has four in the French Concession and four in the International Settlement; ㊄ the Yellow Swastika Society has one in the French Concession; ㊅ the Jiangning Guild Hall has one in the International Settlement; ㊆ the Hometown Association of the Five Counties of Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jinli, Liyang, and Yangzhou has one in the French Concession; ㊇ the Chinese Jisheng Society has two in the International Settlement; ㊈ the Qiyuan Lotus Society has one in the French Concession; ㊉ the Taijiabao Hometown Association has one. In addition, there are still shelters in various hometown associations. It is estimated that there are about 150 in the International Settlement and about 40 in the French Concession, with a population of about 160,000. In the refugee area of the Nantao district, in addition to poor households, there are also 100,000 refugees. According to the French Municipal Council, there are currently more than 32,000 vagrant people in the alleys of the French Concession. As for the vagrant refugees in the International Settlement, the number must also be very large. The food and clothing for the refugees in each shelter averages about one national currency unit per person per day.

Since the war situation has changed repeatedly, the war zone has expanded, and the number of refugees has increased several times compared to before. As a result, the internal work of the Relief of War Zone Refugees Committee of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Association is extremely tense. Although the repatriation department of the association has encountered many obstacles due to traffic, it is still working hard to find ways to repatriate. It is learned that the association repatriated 939 refugees from the eight provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Fujian on the 28th and 29th of last month, sending them to Tongzhou on the Luzhou Fusheng ship of the Yihe Company, and to Fuzhou on the Nanchang ship of the Dagu Company, and then returning to their hometowns to engage in production.

### October Police Report of the Public Works Department

Police officers from various police stations handled 26 narcotics cases and arrested 104 criminals. Ninety-six feature films and short films were examined by the Police Department. Among them, one feature film was approved for screening after being censored, and another has not yet been decided. Six short films need to be censored, and another has not yet been decided. The rest all passed.

As of the end of October, there were 110 refugee shelters in the International Settlement, sheltering a total of 72,070 refugees. In addition, there were about 4,200 refugees living in various alleys and vacant houses.

The situation in factories has improved considerably. Sixty-seven factories started work in October, employing a total of 26,900 workers. There was one strike.

A total of 1,269 public rickshaw pullers were fined by the Central and Old Zha police stations for violating traffic regulations. One public rickshaw puller's license was issued, and 36 private rickshaw puller's licenses were issued.

There were a total of 412 accidental events that caused death, injury, or damage to property.

### The US Raises the Issue of Chinese Customs with Japan Again

Hull Describes the History of Sino-US Trade, British House of Commons Discusses the Shanghai Settlement Issue

[Washington] The United States has made a stronger new representation to Japan, opposing any attempt by the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai to disrupt the Chinese customs system. The State Department said that this move was in the form of a formal written document, submitted by the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explaining the views previously stated by the United States. Ambassador Grew had already expressed the US's concern about the Japanese military's attempt to interfere with the Chinese customs system to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs verbally on Saturday. This written note should have the same intention as the previous verbal representation. Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the United States has requested the Japanese government to consult with the US government before changing the Chinese customs system. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)

[Washington] Regarding the issue of Chinese customs, US Ambassador to Japan Grew submitted a note to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the press to explain it, saying that this note specifically mentioned the issue of customs in Shanghai, and its content first briefly described the history of trade between China and the United States, and explained that the United States has significant interests in China. Therefore, if Japan wants to revise the current Chinese tariff rates or change the current state of customs administration, it must first consult the US government. Diplomatic circles believe that this note is very broad and in fact reaffirms the policy of maintaining the Open Door in China in accordance with the existing multilateral treaties signed by the United States. (Havas dispatch of the 29th)

[London] Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne replied to the Liberal Party opposition member Harris in the House of Commons today, saying that the losses suffered by British industries in Shanghai cannot be estimated at present. Harris continued to ask whether the financial losses suffered by the British in Shanghai have not yet been estimated, and that these losses have been suffered for a long time. Cranborne replied that the British Consul-General in Shanghai has been ordered to collect and compile these requests. Cranborne also answered a question from Labour MP Fletcher, outlining the situation of land ownership in the International Settlement, saying that it has been said before that the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, on which the International Settlement is governed, are very difficult and specialized to interpret. Cranborne agreed that the Land Regulations cannot be amended without the consent of the Chinese government. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)

[London] At the meeting of the House of Commons today, Labour MP Henderson asked the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Earl of Cranborne, about the issue of the Shanghai International Settlement, saying that the Foreign Office authorities have paid attention to the recent remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on this issue, and whether they will take various measures with the United States and France to safeguard treaty rights. The Earl of Cranborne replied, "I saw Prime Minister Konoe's remarks in the newspapers, and their nature does not seem to be the same as the interpretation made by Mr. Henderson. As far as I know, these remarks do not specifically refer to the Shanghai International Settlement, but I will continue to investigate to clarify the truth. At the same time, the British government will continue to maintain close contact with the United States and France in order to safeguard treaty rights." (Havas dispatch of the 29th)

### US Navy Families Can Return to Shanghai

The US Denies Lending Money to China

[Washington] The Commander of the Navy in Manila has learned that the US government does not object to the families of officers and men of the Asian Fleet and the US Marine Corps returning to Shanghai, as the situation in Shanghai is now calmer than before. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)

[Washington] According to a certain Japanese newspaper, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Russia, and Belgium plan to secretly lend a large sum of money to China to purchase arms. US Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the press, denying this. (Havas dispatch of the 29th)

### British Far East Shipping Greatly Affected

Secret New Measures Have Been Established

[London] According to the annual report of the British Steamship Company, the unsettled situation in China has greatly affected the income of the British Steamship Company. British and foreign shipping companies operating in the Far East have established close cooperation methods, and it is now hoped that the new methods will be beneficial to travelers and shipping companies. The company's profit and loss statement shows a surplus of 327,000 pounds. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)

[London] The Japanese authorities are now ordering that goods originally intended to be shipped to Shanghai but eventually diverted to Japan must be transshipped within one month, otherwise Japanese import duties must be paid. The London Chamber of Commerce today specifically asked the British government to pay attention to this matter, and asked the Foreign Office to negotiate with the Japanese government to extend the deadline to three months, because if Japanese import duties are paid, the taxes paid will not be refunded when the goods are transshipped to Shanghai in the future. The Chamber of Commerce stated the various losses suffered by shippers as a result, saying that it is often difficult for shippers to find out where their goods are. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)

### Japan's Next Budget is 2.868 Billion Yuan

Formally Determined by the Cabinet Meeting, Temporary Military Expenditures Are Not Included

[Tokyo] The draft general budget for the next year to cope with the long-term war and adopt a wartime system (excluding temporary military expenditures and special accounts) was finalized late on the 29th, with a total amount of 2.868 billion yuan. It was attached to the original draft budget of the Ministry of Finance and formally decided at the Cabinet meeting on the 30th. The characteristics of the next year's budget are listed as follows:

㊀ Taking the compilation of a wartime budget as a prerequisite, temporary military expenditures are treated separately. On the general accounting, the expenses related to military operations will be fully recognized. That is, the expenses for the China Incident in the future, temporary military expenditures, and supplementary budgets for special accounts will be decided in January next year, so they are not included in the formal budget. As for the national defense plans in the budgets of the Army and Navy Ministries, they will be fully recognized according to the established plans.

㊁ Expenses for military rescue and other rear defense policies will also be fully recognized.

㊂ In order to improve productivity under the wartime system, expenses for training skilled workers and other items, as well as expenses for improving the international balance of payments and preventing the import of substitute industries, will be recognized as much as possible.

㊃ Existing expenses in various provinces must still be properly saved. Those that can be saved can reduce the base budget by about 100 million yuan next year.

㊄ Regarding revenue, there are no special efforts to increase income. Temporary tax increases will be considered as a source of funds for temporary military expenditures and supplementary budgets, but they will not be considered in the formal budget. (Dōmei dispatch of the 30th)

### Italy Recognizes the Puppet State, the US Recognizes Breach of Contract

Germany Does Not Follow Suit

[Washington] Diplomatic circles here believe that Italy should not have recognized "Manchukuo," because Italy is also a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty and should respect the integrity of China's sovereignty in any case. Italy's action conflicts with the policy stipulated by former US Secretary of State Stimson, which does not recognize any territory occupied by force. This principle was later incorporated into the resolution of the League of Nations, which Italy also supported. (Guomin dispatch of the 29th)

[Berlin] After the Italian government legally recognized "Manchukuo," semi-official figures in Germany commented that since November of last year, when Japan recognized the Italian Empire and Italy stationed consuls in "Manchukuo," relations between the two sides have become increasingly close. At this time, Italy's further recognition of "Manchukuo" is to be expected. However, Germany's attitude towards the "Manchukuo" issue will not change as a result, because Germany has significant interests in China, and its position is clearly different from that of Italy, so it will not immediately follow in Italy's footsteps. (Havas dispatch of the 29th)

[Rome] Regarding Italy's legal recognition of "Manchukuo," observers in political circles here have recently commented that Italy's policy in the Far East has entered a new stage. Semi-official figures said that this move is based on realism, because "Manchukuo" is rich in natural resources, and Italy can obtain benefits. In addition, regarding the Japanese military's occupation of areas near Shanghai, the general public here said that this does not conflict with Italy's interests. (Havas dispatch of the 29th)

### Economic Sanctions

Research by the Pacific Council

[San Francisco] The Pacific Council recently published a special issue studying "Economic Preparation between China and Japan," stating that the main condition for determining war is economic power. Although China is rich in resources, it has not yet achieved industrialization. Japan is very poor in terms of resources, but it is much more advanced in industry than China. Therefore, Japan's dependence on international trade is also greater than China's. In short, the economic power of the two countries is not very different. In addition to economic conditions, factors that can influence the war situation include military, political, popular sentiment, and international attitudes. Assuming that Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States can impose economic sanctions on Japan, then international attitudes will be the main factor in the future of the war.

### Various Countries Decide to Limit Tea and Rubber Production

The Hague Well-informed sources recently announced that the member states of the International Tea Committee, namely the governments of the Dutch East Indies, British India, and Ceylon, have decided that the tea export volume of each country in 1938-39 should be reduced by 7.5% compared to this year.

[London] The International Rubber Regulation Committee is about to hold a very important meeting. Fairs, Chairman of the New York Rubber Manufacturers Association, told Reuters today that he expects the rubber sales volume in the United States to increase greatly, because the government and the business community are cooperating and the economy is showing signs of recovery. The committee's responsibility now is to prevent excessive fluctuations in rubber market prices so as not to hinder the rubber industry. The Financial Times reported that Mony, the general manager of a certain rubber company, suggested that a rubber price of between ninepence and tenpence per pound is an appropriate price.

### Li维诺夫's Speech Sarcastic about the Ineffectiveness of International Conferences

[Moscow] Foreign Affairs Commissar Li维诺夫 recently delivered a speech to electors in Leningrad, first expressing his gratitude for the electors' trust in him, and then recounting his forty years of experience in party affairs, saying that he had repeatedly had the opportunity to represent the working class, and had a revolutionary relationship with Leningrad. As early as 1905, he participated in editing the first Bolshevik mass newspaper. Li then spoke at length on the issue of the struggle for world peace, saying, "Our peace policy has been specifically expressed in the following points: Our country has proposed complete disarmament and partial disarmament plans to the League of Nations, has concluded non-aggression treaties with ten of the eleven neighboring countries (but Japan refused to conclude one), has proposed a definition of non-aggression that has been accepted by eleven countries, and has put forward several other similar proposals. We not only pay attention to good relations with our neighbors, but also advocate guaranteeing the security of all nations. Starting from the principle of the indivisibility of peace, we have agreed to participate in local mutual assistance conventions, and have concluded mutual assistance agreements with France and Czechoslovakia. We have joined the League of Nations to test its role as an instrument of peace, and have participated in all international conferences aimed at organizing a collective security system. Unfortunately, countries around the world, even the major ones among them, have not all been able to demonstrate the same sincerity and consistent attitude as us, and work towards building peace in the same way as our government. These countries seem to unanimously acknowledge that the serious threat to peace and their own interests comes from fascist aggressor states, and in principle accept the concept of collective security that serves as the foundation of the League of Nations. However, they are unwilling to go beyond agreements and declarations, and empty talk and declarations have no impact on aggressors."

"Imperialism, that is, the tendency to expand territory, seize other countries' land, plunder colonies, and enslave other nations, is something that almost all bourgeois countries possess to some extent. However, since the World War, some of them have felt content with the industries they have acquired through honest means, and currently do not seem to have any intention of launching new aggressions. In addition, there are those who possess this intention but have not dared to speak their minds without reservation. However, there are three countries that openly and without reservation speak their minds every day, determined not to care about any international law, any international treaties, including the treaties they themselves have signed, determined to seize other countries' territories, as long as they are able to do so. Therefore, they resolutely reject all collective cooperation in peaceful organizations. When they declare this kind of policy of aggression, they completely disregard everything, their faces are frightening and hateful. Sometimes they not only declare it, but also put it into practice. And some countries still express doubt about their aggressive declarations, and use every diplomatic means to ask them to confirm and provide a more accurate explanation of these very clear declarations. These countries constantly ask the aggressors the following questions, saying, 'Your country has stated that it does not recognize international treaties, and has even taken action to destroy them. Your country has also stated that it is not prepared to respect the security and integrity of other countries, and has in fact deprived the security and integrity of certain countries. Your country has claimed that it will not cooperate with us, and has in fact refused to participate in meetings of international organizations. However, we do not dare to rashly judge whether what we know about your situation is accurate, and whether what you think in your heart is the same as what you say. We now respectfully ask your country to confirm and provide a complete explanation.' Subsequently, even after receiving a reply confirming it, the act of questioning does not stop. Sometimes, not satisfied with verbal inquiries, they even present the aggressors with written questionnaires, asking them to reply, saying, 'Please admit that you are an aggressor.' Even when the aggressors arrogantly throw the questionnaire into the wastebasket, they still refuse to stop, and instead send official and unofficial envoys, or cabinet members or other politicians, to personally seek confirmation and a complete explanation. Sometimes, the answer received from this kind of inquiry is a blatant insult, and afterwards, they turn around and ask the insulter to confirm and provide a complete explanation of this insult. Unfortunately, the aggressors not only provide verbal or written confirmation, but even, for the sake of special clarity, vigorously kick the sore spot on the feet of those who hinder their actions, while actively implementing their own plans of aggression. In this way, an international division of labor has emerged: some countries specialize in kicking sore spots, while others constantly question and wait for confirmation and a complete explanation."

"We can take the Spanish situation as an example. Germany and Italy, taking advantage of the mutiny of generals in that country (and the mutiny was in fact orchestrated and organized by those two countries), openly dispatched military manpower and material resources to aid the rebels. Other countries whose important interests were harmed by this intervention in Spain's internal affairs by Italy and Germany declared to those two countries, 'Your country certainly has no intention of interfering in Spain's internal affairs. What seems like interference so far is due to misunderstandings. This point should be confirmed. At the same time, we will not interfere, and although we have every right to assist the legitimate government of Spain, we will not provide assistance. We will also sign treaties and organize committees to observe the situation.' So the treaties were signed and the committees are observing the situation, but the interference by Italy and Germany is increasing day by day. Later, at the request of the Soviet government, monitoring was implemented on the sea and land borders of Spain, but this monitoring method immediately developed loopholes, and large numbers of foreign troops and military supplies continued to sneak in and were sent to the rebels. After the committee observed all these facts, it again asked Italy and Germany for confirmation, and declared to them, 'Your intentions are certainly not to send large numbers of troops to Spain. The reason you are sending them now is due to misunderstandings. Your countries have no need to station troops in Spain, so you should be willing to recall them. If so, please confirm it. We are prepared to facilitate the generals of the rebel forces you are protecting in some way, and to blockade the legitimate government of Spain, in order to repay your kindness.' However, Germany and Italy, regardless of whether there was confirmation or not, continued to send new reinforcements and military supplies to Spain due to misunderstandings. As a result, the rebellion in Spain, which could have been quelled by the legitimate government in a matter of weeks, has expanded into a large-scale armed conflict with international significance. This conflict has been prolonged for more than a year, and when it will end is still unpredictable."

"Precisely because international law is being trampled on barbarously and the so-called great powers are all helpless, aggressor states are able to progress step by step and continue to seize new bases for aggression. New acts of aggression are also occurring in other parts of the world. We can cite another example in the Far East. Japan has dispatched large numbers of troops to invade China, occupying the land of many provinces, wantonly bombing Chinese cities, and implementing all the actions that have always been recognized as war. Japan has also declared to the world that it will continue its offensive until its own set task is completely achieved, until China directly negotiates with it, that is, surrenders. Japan has also openly issued warnings everywhere, stating that it will never accept mediation from any country. China, based on the articles of the League of Nations Covenant, requested the protection of the League of Nations. So the League of Nations organized a committee, and the committee further organized a subcommittee, and then sent a letter to Japan, saying, 'We did not agree to your offensive action, it must be due to a misunderstanding. We hereby invite you to come here and talk about it to confirm this. In order to prevent your country from feeling isolated in our group, we have also invited your good friend Germany to attend.'"

"However, Japan's reply confirmed that it was not due to a misunderstanding, stating that its offensive was a completely intentional action, and insisted that it could only negotiate with China on the condition that the latter completely submitted. This reply left the League of Nations at a loss. So the League of Nations decided to transfer the issue to the countries concerned with the Far East incident, that is, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, which had already been violated twice by Japan."

"So the Brussels Conference was convened, and the Soviet Union, which was not a signatory to the treaty, was also invited to participate. The activities of this conference can be best explained by a cartoon I saw in a newspaper in a certain country. The painting depicted the venerable representatives of eighteen countries working together with all their might to drag a huge letter addressed to Japan and deposit it in the mailbox. Everyone knows the content of this letter: it was a renewed request for Japan to confirm whether it intended to invade China, and to inquire whether it was willing to temporarily suspend the invasion and accept mediation."

"Japan's confirmation arrived soon, in which, using rather troublesome language, it stated that its invasion of China was purely intentional and had a definite purpose, stating that Japan did not need mediation from any country, and only wished to negotiate with China, and stating that the only thing the Brussels Conference could contribute was to force China to surrender. The result of this reply was that the Brussels Conference, like the League of Nations, also came to a dead end, and so the conference closed."

"I feel that you may find it peculiar that experienced bourgeois diplomats cannot understand the intentions of the aggressors' strategies. You seem to think that their expression of disbelief in the aggressors' declarations is purely a disguise, and that their request for confirmation and a complete explanation is actually a smokescreen for colluding with the aggressors. You have the right to make such guesses, but because of my position, I should not express such doubts. I can only state the official position of other countries, and leave the rest for you to guess."

"All of the above is the situation in recent international diplomatic circles. As for the Soviet Union's diplomatic stance, you should already know it well from domestic newspapers, and I don't need to go into detail. In short, whenever we encounter a suitable opportunity, when our own interests are not involved, we will definitely state clearly that we are willing to cooperate equally with all countries, large and small, and give the aggressors a collective blow. But so far, there is no collective to deliver the blow. As for ourselves, we deeply believe in the aggressor states' own declarations. We even recognized the existence of aggression before the aggression was publicly proclaimed. And when the aggressors openly announced their acts of aggression, we deeply knew that such declarations, even if they contained elements of intimidation and blackmail, were a serious threat to peace, and did not require confirmation or a complete explanation."

"Of course, aggressors do not always specify the most recent destination of their aggression. They will point out many aspects, making it difficult for others to take appropriate steps on the most threatened side. To distract attention, they often use the tactic of striking east and west, and sometimes even adopt a naïve magic trick, claiming that they are uniting the land, sea, and air forces of several countries to practice marksmanship on the ideals of the Communist International."

"But one thing is true, that aggressor states all lack staying power, and precisely because of the preparation for war and the already conducted adventurous undertakings, their economic resources have been depleted to such an extent, and their domestic strength has been so weakened, that they do not dare to conduct a serious, long-term war. Therefore, when they continue to aggress in the future, they will inevitably have to seek out the path of least resistance."

"They will not be able to find this path of least resistance on our country's borders. We know this, and they know it themselves. They deeply know that the Soviet Union's defense capabilities do not rely on international collusion, but entirely on the ever-increasing power of the Red Army, the Red Navy, and the Red Air Force. They deeply know that our leader Stalin, in the normal business of the state apparatus, pays particular attention to the issue of national defense, protecting our country's territory and preventing an inch of it from falling into the hands of the enemy."

"War preparation begins in peacetime, which, among other things, includes organizing spy networks in neighboring countries and establishing agencies to carry out various tasks, which are now commonly referred to as the 'fifth column.' You have heard that the Czech Republic recently arrested about a thousand spies. At the same time, a serious conspiracy to harm France has also been discovered. However, our potential enemies should know that in this regard, they will not be able to find the path of least resistance within the Soviet Union. They deeply know that establishing armories, fortresses, bunkers, and organizing a traitorous team to utilize such facilities may be possible in some places, but it is absolutely impossible in the Soviet Union. They deeply know that our Internal Affairs Committee will never allow such plans to mature, and that its vigilance and power are sharp and strong enough to eradicate all Trotskyist and fascist spy and sabotage agencies from the root. I deeply believe that all Soviet citizens, all nationalities, at this time will certainly express solidarity and unity under one great, irresistible will to defend our motherland and shatter all attempts at aggression."

### French Mail Ship Carrying贡 Rice Arrives in Shanghai

The fourth batch is scheduled to arrive in port the day after tomorrow. A total of fifteen new rice shops have been established. Various institutions and businesses have entrusted purchases on their behalf.

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice. The fourth batch loaded onto the Zhejiang ship was delayed due to bad weather along the coast and will not arrive in Shanghai until the day after tomorrow. The French mail ship "琴拉泡脫" arrived in Shanghai yesterday with 5,000 bags of 贡 rice. Fifteen new rice shops have been established in the Public Concession. Details are as follows:

Four batches delayed: French trading company "达孚" was entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company to order 115,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, which were divided into four batches and transported to Shanghai on foreign ships. The fourth batch of 30,000 bags was loaded onto the British "太古公司" Zhejiang ship and delayed due to bad weather along the coast. The company recently received a telegram from the ship owner stating that the ship has passed the port and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on December 3 (Friday). The Rice Shop Association has completed the distribution of the third batch of rice. The distribution of the fourth batch of rice will be carried out after the ship arrives.

Entrusted to purchase foreign rice: The French "邮船公司" mail ship "琴拉泡脫" arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 500 tons of Saigon rice (approximately 5,000 bags). At 1:00 PM yesterday, the cargo owner, French trading company "达孚," sent personnel to unload the goods and prepared 20 trucks for transport. It is reported that the above foreign rice was entrusted to order by various factories and charitable organizations in the city and paid import taxes in accordance with customs regulations.

In addition, French trading company "达孚," in addition to cooperating with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company to purchase Saigon rice and transport it to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply, also accepted the entrustment of various Chinese and foreign commercial firms in the city to purchase foreign rice on their behalf. The quantity is quite large and is currently being loaded and transported to Shanghai. One batch has already been loaded onto the "太古公司" cargo ship the night before and is moored at the Bund in the French Concession. From 11:00 AM yesterday, "达孚" used large barges to transfer the cargo to the "三马路" Bund pier for unloading. The company also sent dozens of employees, with "达孚" signs wrapped around their hands, to handle the delivery at the pier, using a large number of transport vehicles, escorted by British soldiers, to deliver the goods to various commercial firms. The transportation continued until about 6:00 PM.

Huge orders: Yesterday, it was learned from the food industry that the Shanghai food groups, with the assistance of the authorities of the British and French concessions, ordered a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon, Vietnam, and entrusted it to foreign trading companies engaged in the import of foreign rice. The shipments have been loaded onto foreign ships in batches and are being transported to Shanghai. From December 2 to December 15, the estimated total number of foreign rice imports during this period is approximately 150,000 bags.

Purchasing domestic rice: Members of the grain, bean, and rice industry associations purchased 300,000 dan of domestic rice from 温州, 台州, and 宁波 in Zhejiang. The certificates of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce have been processed and purchasing has already begun. It is decided to load it onto the British "太古怡和" company ships for transport to Shanghai. As for the date of arrival in Shanghai, the first batch is expected to arrive no earlier than December 10.

New rice shops: After the population of the Public Concession increased sharply, many new rice shops have been established. Recently, fifteen new shops have been established, including "金大盛," "协泰," "农功," "公大孙记," "黄长泰," "元泰," "志成," "裕泰," "同泰," "振兴," "和兴," "协新泰," "裕泰," "福泰协记," and "慎源." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce transferred the donation certificates for the shops to open.

Thorough investigation of smuggling: "申时社" reports that the Shanghai West "联益会" recently sent a letter to Mr. 何德奎, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, stating: "Dear Sir, according to investigator 刘志勇's report, at 4:50 PM on the 29th of this month, while passing through "山海关路懋益里," he caught sight of a truck, license plate number 17178, loaded with more than forty bags of Saigon rice, with the "达孚" trading company's brand on the bags. Several workers were moving the rice to the back door of number 52 in the "里," and their actions were very secretive. Whether there were other circumstances is unknown. Upon arrival at the association, our association, after receiving the report, believed that this action clearly violated your bureau's regulations on retail sales and was reported to the meeting by our chairman "庄平," together with investigator "魏侠," and others, who inquired about the truth. However, the matter was evaded as being a matter for the downstairs, and the upstairs was completely unaware, and the language was extremely vague, which made people even more suspicious. According to the testimony of "司闇," No. 2125 in the "里," at 4:50 PM on this day, a truck did arrive, carrying a large number of white rice, and he opened the iron gate on "山海关路." At 5:30 PM, another truck came and took away more than ten bags of rice, etc. Our association believed that the facts were already clear, and immediately returned to the association. According to your bureau's regulations, the distribution and retail of rice should be limited to rice shops in the city, and those who hoard and speculate or manipulate the market will be severely punished. The above-mentioned foreign rice of unknown origin, regardless of which rice shop it belongs to, has the suspicion of monopoly and speculation. This matter concerns the regulation of the people's food supply and affects social stability. In addition to filing a case with the "新闸路" police station and questioning the Rice Shop Association, we ask your bureau to conduct a thorough and rigorous investigation as soon as possible to prevent abuses and maintain the people's food supply. This is a matter of public interest."

### Do Not Whip Civilians Buying Rice

It is contrary to both law and reason. The Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the two concessions for rectification.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, according to a letter from the Thermos Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association, the authorities of the two concessions, in view of the food panic and the danger of starvation among the common people, have tried their best to maintain the supply of food and purchased foreign rice extensively to provide relief. However, demand exceeds supply, and the situation in which retail rice shops are crowded is causing traffic jams. Some wait all day without getting a single grain of rice, while others compete and jostle, falling and getting injured. Petty thieves are taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out their tricks on a large scale. The detectives maintaining order have failed to guide and suppress the situation peacefully and arbitrarily whip people at will, which has made the situation even more chaotic and miserable to witness. We believe that although the food panic is irreparable, order can still be maintained in door-to-door retail sales. Members of our association have witnessed the miserable situation and have repeatedly come to the association to express their concerns and ask us to advocate humanity and speak out for the poor. Our association also believes that the food panic has reached this point, and if the crowding and chaos are allowed to continue, accidents are inevitable. Our association is deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. We dare to ask your councils to sympathize with the difficulties of the people and approve the forwarding of letters to the authorities of the two concessions, ordering the detectives maintaining order to guide and suppress the situation peacefully and not to arbitrarily whip the poor, etc. Upon arrival at the association, this matter has been reported to our association repeatedly by the Pawnshop Industry and the Thermos Bottle Manufacturing Industry. It is believed that the patrolmen arbitrarily whipping civilians buying rice in order to maintain order is not only illegal from a legal perspective, but also greatly inhuman from a moral perspective. We hereby ask your bureau to take appropriate measures to rectify the situation. We hope to receive a reply."

### North German Express Mail Ship Resumes Service

Shanghai route definitely resumed. Departs from Shanghai for Germany on January 21.

"美最时" 洋行, the agent of the North German Lloyd's Far East express liners, suspended the service of the "香霍斯脱," "那爱斯奴," and "柏士丹" on the China-Germany line after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, diverting them to Hong Kong. All Shanghai passengers had to transfer ships in Hong Kong. This has been going on for more than three months. Now that the front line is gradually shifting west and there is no immediate danger in Shanghai, the North German Lloyd has decided to resume the Shanghai route. The "柏士丹", the express mail ship departing from Germany this time, has been ordered to resume service to Shanghai. The first departure date from Shanghai to Germany is January 21.

### Flour Prices Soar Unabated

In recent days, flour prices have been soaring unabated. Although flour mills are working day and night to produce flour, there is still a shortage of supply. Although there is a large stock of wheat, the raw material for flour, in the city, the new wheat from Henan and Shandong cannot be transported to Shanghai due to traffic blockages. Therefore, in order to prepare for the future, the flour mills in the city have specifically ordered a large amount of foreign wheat from Canada. Both spot and futures goods will be shipped continuously from February to March next year.

### China Children's Relief Association Provides Relief to War-Stricken Children

Refugee area children will be moved to concessions for accommodation. Children in various war zones will be provided with relief separately.

The China Children's Relief Association is actively promoting its work to provide relief to war-stricken children. In Shanghai, since the outbreak of the war, the association has opened a war-stricken children's shelter at the "金业学校" on "大通路白克路," accommodating a total of 178 war-stricken children aged four to fourteen. In addition to having many nurses treat the children's illnesses, three female teachers have also been hired to teach lessons regularly, focusing on both education and upbringing, which is very complete.

Expanded accommodation after selecting a new site: Since the establishment of the refugee area in the Nanshi area, the association has been deeply concerned about the war-stricken children in the area. A person in charge has been identified to handle the affairs of rescuing women and children. The children's treatment center to be established in the area will also be established soon. Furthermore, since the original war-stricken children's shelter is limited in space and cannot be expanded, "圣约翰青年中学" in "曹家渡" has been selected as a new site. The school building is spacious enough to accommodate more than a thousand war-stricken children and has gardens and sports grounds for recreation, which is especially suitable. All preparations have now begun. It is reported that the shelter will be moved in around the 5th of this month. At the same time, it is planned to negotiate with the concession authorities to move the war-stricken children in the Nanshi refugee area into the shelter to expand the relief efforts. The association has also recently decided to abolish the "over four years old" regulation for accommodation, that is, all children from newborns to fourteen years old will be accommodated and provided with relief.

Dispatching personnel to investigate the Ping-Han Railway: During this all-out war, there are many war-stricken children in various war zones in Liaoning and Guangdong. The association previously notified its branches in various places to provide relief nearby. It is now learned that the association believes that the war in Hebei and Shanxi is tense and that the war-stricken children wandering along the Ping-Han Railway urgently need relief in this severe cold weather. It has decided to dispatch two or three staff members to conduct an on-site investigation. Once the association receives the report, it will approve the appropriate accommodation in a safer area.

There are ways to raise relief funds: The association's work is expanding, so relief funds are also urgently needed. However, it is learned that the association has now raised 100,000 yuan. In addition to the 20,000 yuan disbursed by the association, it has also been agreed that the 80,000 yuan previously allocated by the China-US Children's Relief Association for the construction of the association's building will be used to meet the immediate needs. This matter has also been agreed upon by the American side.

### The Old North Gate Iron Fence Opened, Residents of the Southern City Moved In One After Another

Charitable Organizations Sent Roadside Refugees Inside; Those Without Permits Were Not Allowed into the Concession

According to Xin Xin News Agency, the transportation issue between the refugee area in the Southern City and the concession, after the International Relief Committee and the Businessmen's Association of the Refugee Area requested the French authorities to allow residents to reside within the area, various charitable organizations are now devising methods to transport refugees wandering on the roads into the area for accommodation. Details are as follows:

Iron Fence Opened, Residents Moved In: The French Concession authorities, after permitting residents who could not make a living within the concession to be sent to the refugee area in the Southern City for long-term residence, yesterday opened half of the iron gate in the middle of the Old North Gate for passage and dispatched a large number of patrol officers to maintain order outside the iron gate. Xin Xin News Agency reporters visited the area yesterday morning and observed that many residents were carrying belongings into the area. Notices were posted both inside and outside the iron gate stating: "Those without permits will not be allowed into the concession under any circumstances."

Roadside Refugees Sent to Shelters: Various charitable organizations in the city, recognizing that all shelters within the concession were full, and that refugees wandering in various roads and lanes had nowhere to live, enduring wind and dew all day long, not only faced difficult lives but were also suffering from hunger and cold during the severe winter. Their situation was truly pitiful. If they were not accommodated, they would surely freeze to death. Since the opening of the iron gate of the French Concession, charitable organizations are finding ways to send all the refugees on the roads into the area for resettlement, to preserve life and uphold humanity.

### Dredging Bureau Negotiated for the Return of Dredgers

Independent Nature Affects Water Conservancy; Shen Tan Project Also Set Back

After the Dredging Bureau's dredgers, surveying vessels, ferries, etc., were all seized, it has been learned that the chief engineer has been negotiating for their return. Details are as follows:

Negotiating for Return: The Dredging Bureau's large dredger "Jianshe," the large survey vessel "Liliang," and other ferries "Lijiang," "Liguo," etc., after being seized, the Bureau stated that the cost of building these vessels came from the collection of dredging taxes from foreign ships, and the nature of these vessels is independent. The tasks of each vessel are related to the water conservancy of the Huangpu River. Now that they have been seized, dredging work cannot proceed. It is now learned that the Bureau's chief engineer, Mr. Xue Zhuobin, has been negotiating for their return.

Project Stalled: The Bureau's large dredger "Jianshe" was newly ordered from Germany the year before last. This vessel is one of the largest dredgers in the world. Its sole purpose was to excavate the Shen Tan (sunken sandbar) outside the Wusongkou, so that large ocean liners with deeper drafts could directly enter and exit the Huangpu River in the future, indirectly benefiting the prosperity of Shanghai's commercial port. The initial completion date was set at five years. Since the vessel arrived in Shanghai and began work, less than 20% of the project has been completed. Now that it has been abruptly set back, the completion of the Shen Tan project will be difficult to achieve as scheduled.

### More Tugs and Other Vessels Were Hauled Away Yesterday

In the past few days, Japanese troops intercepted more than ten customs patrol ships, over thirty large and small customs vessels, over ten large and small municipal ferries, and over thirty privately-owned tugboats. Even the customs fireboat "Puji" was not spared. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that at about 11:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese side dispatched tugboats to haul away the two large tugboats "Nanyang" and "Beiyang" of the Italian company, claiming that they were operated by our side. At about 3:00 PM, they also hauled away the "Yuebao" steam launch and the "Feiting" small launch (used by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company), the "Yuntai" small launch (used by Texaco), which were docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession, and the "Hu Ning" fire launch of the Customs, which was docked at the Wuma Road Wharf. Moreover, more than twenty commercial wooden barges (commonly known as "wharf boats") docked at various wharves in Pudong and Puxi were also towed away one after another. All of the above-mentioned vessels are now detained in the Huishan Wharf area of the Huangpu River for their use.

### Fires Broke Out Again in the Southern City and Pudong

Dense Smoke Connected Across the River; Unprecedented Tragic Situation

Starting from 1:00 PM yesterday, seven fires broke out in the Southern City area, from the Old North Gate eastward, passing behind the City God Temple to the Great South Gate, Zhizaoju Road, Fangbang Road, Daji Road, and ending at Riyuegang. Black smoke soared, and flames spread in all directions, presenting an unusually fierce scene. The fires were still burning late into the night.

There had been no fires in the Pudong area for two days, but at 2:25 PM yesterday, a large fire broke out in a local bungalow west of Wangjiagou, behind Tiebanqiao on Beihutang Road. Dense smoke rose straight into the sky, connecting with the dense smoke in the Southern City. From a distance, the southeastern area was filled with smoke and mist, creating an extremely tragic scene. The fire in Pudong grew fiercer and spread in three directions: southeast, west. The fire began to subside around 5:30 PM in the evening, but the embers were not yet extinguished. In total, about seventy or eighty tiled bungalows were destroyed over a period of three hours.

### Transportation on the Huangpu River Was Intermittent

The Gaohang Line Was Blocked Yesterday Afternoon

The ferry crossings at Yangjing, Donggou, and Gaohang in Pudong have been intermittently blocked in recent days, causing repeated disruptions. The Yangjing line was the first to be blockaded, and the Donggou line was also blocked the day before yesterday, with no boats available for travel. The situation had not been resolved by yesterday and continued to be suspended, leaving more than 10,000 civilians and vegetable vendors stranded on the west side of the Huangpu River. The source of vegetables from Pudong was cut off, greatly affecting the vegetable market in this city. The Gaohang line was also intermittently blocked. At 7:30 AM yesterday, the Diana ferry of the Ma Le Company departed from Shanghai for Gaohang. Because passengers on the Yangjing and Donggou lines had no boats to take, they also tried to compete to switch to the Gaohang ferry to go to Pudong. The boat was small, and the people were many, which was extremely difficult. After the ship arrived in Gaohang, it carried a boatload of passengers back to Shanghai. At 10:00 AM, it carried another 600 to 700 passengers from Shanghai to Gaohang before being prevented from transporting passengers until 4:00 PM in the afternoon, when the empty ship was released to return to Shanghai. Therefore, the Gaohang line was blocked again yesterday afternoon.

### Two News Agencies Stopped Publishing

Shen Shi News Agency and Da Gong News Agency, known for their fast and accurate news, have achieved considerable success in the local press. Due to environmental constraints, they have decided to temporarily cease publishing starting today (the 1st).

### Recent Situation of Nantong Shipping

Zi Lin Daily reported that although Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Dockyard still have ships sailing from Shanghai to Nantong, they cannot guarantee whether passengers arriving in Nantong can proceed to Nanjing, Hankou, and other ports. According to people from Nantong, the area is now full of passengers. The two companies are still maintaining small ferry services in ports above the Jiangyin blockade zone. However, because there are so many people from Nanjing and other war zones seeking refuge, the small ferries are always fully occupied. It is especially difficult for foreigners with luggage to find a place. The bus service operated by Taikoo Dockyard is also unable to pass due to the roads being crowded with pedestrians. Therefore, the two companies are now only selling tickets to Nantong. If passengers wish to continue their journey, they must find their own way. The two companies naturally hope to restore normal shipping conditions as soon as possible, but they cannot determine when this will be possible.

### All-Christianity Promotes One-Cent Relief Movement

Since the National Christian Council of China launched the One-Cent Relief Movement, all parties have actively participated, considering it easy and convenient. Not only have churches across the country responded enthusiastically, but also many members of society have voluntarily donated. Dr. Chen Wenyuan, General Secretary of the Council, and Rev. Li Laoshi, a British missionary and staff member, took a boat to Hong Kong yesterday (the 30th) and will transfer to South China and Central China to inspect the current situation of churches in various places, promote relief work, and vigorously promote the One-Cent Movement. The Shanghai Minnan Chinese Christian Church specially made 2,000 One-Cent Relief Bags and donated them to Chen to take with him for distribution and use. It is also said that Chen carried various relief publicity materials, preparing to distribute them everywhere.

### Severance Pay of Two Months' Salary Given to Dismissed Personnel

Since the war shifted westward, various agencies in the city have closed down one after another, and all employees have been dismissed. The central government believes that these dismissed personnel have worked hard in the past and are now in dire straits, so they should be treated with consideration. Therefore, they have ordered the relevant authorities to give all dismissed personnel of the agencies and affiliated institutions under their jurisdiction, in addition to their November salaries, an additional two months' salary as severance pay. It is said that the funds have been deposited and that those who have been dismissed are grateful. The funds will be distributed soon.

### Emerging Embezzlement Cases in Shelters

Falsely Reporting the Number of Refugees and Illegally Obtaining Food; Main Culprit at Large, Two Accomplices Arrested

The directors of the Xinheng and Hengfeng shelters under the Shanghai Charity Federation Joint Relief Association, Li Rensheng and Gao Shuqing, were found to have been selling rationed food such as rice and flour meant for refugees. They were arrested and sentenced to five years in prison by the First Special Court, with fines ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 yuan each. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, a third similar case has occurred. The Fifteenth Shelter under the Relief Association was originally located on Fahua Anhe Temple Road, but was later moved to No. 680 Haige Road due to the

Withdrawal of Our Troops and was headed by Fan Dajin, with Kong Xianyu from Tongzhou as his deputy, and Wang Jianqing from Hangzhou as his assistant. Recently, the Relief Association received a tip from Boy Scouts that the shelter also had the same issues as Xinheng and Hengfeng. The Association sent investigator Xie Guanghan to investigate on the 26th of this month. It was found that the shelter's records on that day showed

The Number of Refugees as 822, but the actual number was 586, an overreporting of 236 people. Also, the shelter reported only two bags of flour in stock, but there were actually more than 30 bags. There were also obvious shortages in the amount of rice. The association then reported the facts to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent Detective Tang Zihong to investigate at 5:00 PM yesterday. On that day, the number of refugees was 667, but the records showed 750, an overreporting of 87 people. Also, the shelter

Reported the Consumption of Flour as 25 bags per day, but actually only used 20 bags. Kong Xianyu and Wang Jianqing, who were at the shelter, were arrested, while Fan Zijing had fled. Detectives went to his home at No. 491, Lane 510, Datong Road, but were unable to arrest him. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyers Wang Luotang, Qian Xunjiu, and Chen Ming explained the case, stating that the police needed to investigate the case in detail and requested permission to detain them for one week for further interrogation, which was approved by Judge Chuan Lin after a brief interrogation of Kong and Wang.

### Murder in Xiahui Fang

Robbers Coveted Gold Bars and Jewelry; Old Clerk Killed by Axe

Hengfu Silver Store at No. 368 Nanjing Road and Dafengheng Red Gold Store at No. 388 Nanjing Road, seeing the bombing of Nanjing Road and the Bund and Risheng Building after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, which damaged houses and caused deaths and injuries, feared that the war would affect Nanjing Road and both stores. After discussion by the managers of both stores, they jointly rented an empty Western-style house at No. 12 Xiahui Fang on Xiahui Road in the French Concession as an

Emergency Shelter. After renting it, clerks, relatives, and friends of the two stores temporarily stored boxes and luggage containing clothes and other items that had been moved out for refuge, and each store sent an old clerk to stay and guard the place. Hengfu sent Zhang Jinhua (63 years old, from Nantong, with over 30 years of service), Dafengheng sent Zhuang Hongqing (42 years old, from Wuxi), and a silversmith, He A'de (34 years old, originally from the Southern City, who was staying there for refuge)

Stayed There Every Night. Their beds were upstairs on the second floor. Zhuang and He left early and returned late, while Zhang stayed in the house during the day to watch the door because of his old age. At 7-8 AM on the 29th of last month, when Zhuang and He got up and went out, Zhang was still asleep. At 5:30 PM on the same day, He A'de returned first, knocked on the door, but received no response. He assumed that Zhang Jinhua had also gone out. He waited at the entrance of the lane until 8:30 PM, when Zhuang Hongqing returned. He opened the lock with his key and went inside, going straight upstairs to the second floor. He

Smelled Blood. Upon turning on the light, he discovered that Zhang Jinhua had been hacked to death in his bed with a sharp axe. An axe and a hammer, both stained with blood, were left beside the bed. Upon closer inspection, Zhang's right neck had been hacked with an axe, about an inch deep. His head and face had been hacked about four or five times. His left eye, mouth, and nose had all been hacked open. Blood stained the bedding. The boxes and trunks had all been opened, and the clothes were in a mess on the ground. They immediately notified the managers of Hengfu and Dafengheng to come and inspect the scene, and determined that it was

Robbers Coveting Gold. They suspected that the house contained gold bars and jewelry and attempted robbery. However, they could not find anything, so they overturned the boxes and trunks to search for loot. It was speculated that there must have been an accomplice among them who knew the inside situation. Fearing that the matter would be leaked, they killed Zhang to silence him. They reported the matter to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. They also sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, they reported to the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren came to the scene to inspect the body. He approved the body to be claimed by Zhang's son, Zhang Shoufeng, who signed a guarantee. The police are investigating the crime and will handle the case according to law.

### Two Robbers in the Murder of a Maid Case Transferred

Committed the Crime in the Public Concession; First Special Court Has Already Sentenced Them

On the morning of the 5th of last month, at 7:00 AM, three robbers suddenly broke into the home of Mi Jiemin, a Ningbo native and manager of Xingchang Tobacco Shop at No. 13 Baokang Lane on Xiahui Road, to commit robbery. Luo Ma, Mi's maid from Huzhou, shouted loudly, angering the robbers, who shot and killed her. The robbers fled in a panic. After Mi reported the case to the police, the robbers, armed with weapons, committed robbery at No. 607 Seymour Road in the British Concession the next day. The victim went outside and shouted for help, and police arrived and arrested the robbers Zhou Fafa (27 years old, from Pudong) and Ran Guoliang (29 years old, from Henan). A Browning pistol was found on Zhou's person. After verification, it was confirmed that the gun was the same one used in the robbery and murder of the maid Luo Ma at Mi Jiemin's home. The French police were notified, and the robbers were sent to the First Special Court for prosecution. After the interrogation was completed, they were sentenced to prison. The French police sent detectives to transfer Zhou and Ran back to custody. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Chen Shuoying interrogated them, and the Legal Affairs Department lawyer Chen Ming explained the case, requesting an extension for further investigation before requesting a trial. The court reviewed the case and briefly interrogated the defendants. They approved an extension to investigate the case further and then continue the trial. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Carder Road Robbery Case: Detectives Shoot and Kill a Notorious Robber

One Robber Wounded and Collapsed; The Other Three Robbers Captured

In No. 78, Lane 41, Carder Road, there are no fewer than seven or eight refugee households. Most of them are people without assets, and their living conditions are very pitiful. Unexpectedly, they were also targeted by utterly heartless bandits. At around 6:50 PM yesterday, six bandits, each carrying weapons, broke into the house and robbed the home of Tang Shenzhang, a JiaDing native. However, there was nothing of value in the room. They then saw that the owner was wearing a gold ring and a gold watch on his hand and snatched them to escape. Unexpectedly, the incident was discovered by nearby neighbors, who telegraphed the relevant police station. A large number of detectives were dispatched to rush to the scene. Seeing that things were not going well, the bandits fled towards Avenue Edward VII and opened fire to resist arrest. However, detectives were also lying in wait there, and a fierce battle broke out between the two sides. After about ten minutes, two bandits were shot dead on the side of the road, and one bandit was wounded and collapsed. The remaining three bandits, knowing it was difficult to resist any further, surrendered. Three Mauser pistols, one handgun, and the original stolen gold ring were found on the bandits. They were immediately taken to the police station for investigation. The bodies of the dead bandits have been sent to the coroner's office. However, one passerby was wounded by stray bullets. Fortunately, the injuries were very minor, and after being sent to the hospital, it is guaranteed that he will recover.
