### Full Text of the Declaration of the Third Plenary Session

[Nanjing] The full text of the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee is as follows: On July 10th of last year, when the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was convened, the Central Committee members, in view of the increasing internal and external troubles, worked together to seek salvation. The solemn resolutions made were to safeguard territorial sovereignty externally and to promote peaceful unification internally. Since the adjournment of the meeting, tireless efforts have been made for seven months. This plenary session reviewed the achievements of the past, understood the current situation, and determined the future trends. After detailed discussions on various internal and external issues, solemn resolutions were made. Hereby, the main points are announced to our comrades and our countrymen. The Premier has clearly told us the origin of the national crisis in the Three Principles of the People, and has also clearly shown us the way to save ourselves and strengthen ourselves. Since the September 18th Incident, in extreme pain, we have only been able to follow the teachings of the Premier and seek a way out for the nation. The declaration of the Fifth National Congress clearly stated that "We are at a time of severe national crisis, and what we hold to deal with the crisis is only to uphold the Premier's two great instructions of 'Man will conquer nature' and 'Survival depends on ourselves, destruction depends on others,' to protect the survival of our country and the revival of our nation with the greatest patience and determination. We will not abandon peace until peace is completely hopeless, and when the country has reached a time when sacrifice is inevitable, we will resolutely sacrifice. We will hold on to the determination of the final sacrifice and make the greatest efforts for peace, hoping to turn the tide of the situation with sincerity and determination, so as to achieve the goal of self-reliance and co-existence, and work together with the countries of the world to achieve the realization of the Great Harmony." The declaration of the Second Plenary Session elaborated on this idea and added a more solemn explanation, stating that "Since the country is in this extraordinary situation, we must unite the people of the country with the greatest tolerance and painstaking efforts internally, and we must never recognize any fact of infringing on territorial sovereignty externally, nor will we sign any agreement infringing on territorial sovereignty. If there is a fact of infringement on territorial sovereignty, and political methods are exhausted without success, endangering the fundamental survival of the nation, we must make the determination of final sacrifice, without the slightest hesitation." After the adjournment of the Second Plenary Session, negotiations with Japan proceeded on this basis. In the intervening months, there were several instances of back-and-forth negotiations that were on the verge of breaking down, but the firm stance remained unchanged. When the bandit and puppet troops invaded Suiyuan, the power of the whole country was united to engage in defending the territory and resisting the invaders. Although the perpetrators of the Xi'an Incident wanted to use various slogans as tools to instigate people's hearts, the people of the country remained unshaken. In recent years, the understanding of the Party's ideology has deepened, and it is known that there is no other way to save the country and survive than this. The foreign policy of this plenary session should continue unchanged and strive to promote its progress. The consistent goal of our people is to seek self-reliance internally and co-existence externally. Even if we suffer damages beyond the limit of tolerance and resolutely engage in resistance, we only have the heart of self-defense and have no intention of rejecting foreigners. Therefore, the determination of sacrifice and the hope of peace are not contradictory at all. If the hope of peace has not been completely severed, we are still willing to firmly adhere to the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty to seek a preliminary solution, so that the bandits and puppets lose their dependence and sovereignty can be fully realized. In this way, although the unresolved issues between the two countries have not been completely resolved, the possibility of resolving disputes by peaceful means can begin to emerge. This is what our country must do with the concerted efforts of the whole country in the shortest possible time. As for other international relations, we should follow the path of international peace and strive to increase friendship. All political coordination and economic cooperation must be based on the principle of mutual benefit in order to seek closer mutual relations. This is the attitude that our country has adopted over the years, and it is the inherent spirit of our nationalism. We must adhere to it and further develop and promote it.

The foreign policy is as described above. As for the domestic policy, peaceful unification has been a common creed for the whole country for several years. It is necessary to unify in order to build a modern country. When the great task of saving the country and surviving is carried out, it is necessary to have peace so that everyone knows how to unite sincerely and go to the national crisis together in order to achieve true unification. However, there are things that should be paid attention to here. Peaceful unification and cessation of civil war have different meanings in terms of breadth. The purpose of peaceful unification is to concentrate the power of the entire country and the entire nation to eliminate the current national crisis, and to further step into the great road of democracy. If we understand the meaning of the entire country, we must know that the power of governance is indivisible, especially in the major areas of military affairs, diplomacy, finance, and transportation, which are related to the needs of national defense, and cannot be fully controlled by the central government. Otherwise, partial independence will become an inferior organism, and there will be no escape from international elimination. If we understand the meaning of the entire nation, we must know that all are nationals, sharing weal and woe. Even if there are slight differences in emotions between individuals or groups due to occupational relationships, the interests of the entire nation ultimately outweigh the interests of all individuals and all groups. Moreover, when external insults are constantly coming, the nationals will survive together or perish together. It is absolutely not possible to be confused by the theory of class struggle in order to dismantle their unity. These two meanings are the true meaning of peaceful unification. Therefore, the so-called cessation of civil war means that under the same ideology, differences of opinion are not determined by force, but by consultation. It does not mean that actions to split the country and split the nation can also be used as a pretext for cessation of civil war and proceed without fear. Since July of last year, the cause of unification has gradually taken shape, and the traces of local separatism will become a thing of the past. From now on, we should adhere to the principle of peaceful unification to adapt to national defense and to lay the foundation for long-term stability and security. As for the communist elements, although they have recently used the slogan of joint resistance against the enemy to call each other, according to past events, since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, they have claimed to join this party in order to engage in the National Revolution, but in reality, they have destroyed the National Revolution. Since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, they have used violent means to harm the Republic of China, reducing the country's external strength, and causing countless people's lives and property to be destroyed. All kinds of evils cannot be trusted with a single word. For the sake of the country and the people, this party will never bear to let the armed comrades and all comrades who have shed their blood and sweat for the past few years to engage in the work of suppressing bandits feel the pain of losing their success. No matter what method is used, we must use our own strength to eradicate the Red Scourge in China, so as to avoid endless future sorrows and permanently lay the foundation for national revival. This should be clearly stated to the world. As for organizing the people, training the people, and enabling them to jointly participate in the great cause of nation-building, it is the duty of this party. Since the outbreak of the national crisis, this party has deeply remembered its responsibilities and has stepped forward to do its part. At the same time, it deeply remembers the disaster of the overturned nest, and everyone has the same feeling. Therefore, it has spread the awareness of sincere unity and joint efforts to overcome the national crisis throughout the country. It has also discussed and decided on the convening of the National Assembly at various important meetings of this party. The Fifth National Congress solemnly resolved to convene the National Assembly within the 25th year of the Republic of China and announced the draft constitution. The First Plenary Session, based on this resolution, clearly set the date for November 12 of the same year and established command.

This is a rumor. Because the National Assembly is scheduled to be held on November 12, all issues will be decided at this meeting. There are only eight months left, so there will be no changes. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)

### Statement by Chairman Chiang

Opening up Speech Restricts only Three Points. Concentrating Talent Should be Fully Realized. Pardoning Political Prisoners Should be Limited.

[Nanjing] After the adjournment of the plenary session the other day, Chairman Chiang met with reporters in the rest room of the meeting hall. The reporters paid special attention to the two points of opening up speech and concentrating talent, and asked about the Central Government's future policy, and inquired about the central discussions and decision making process regarding the issue of pardoning political prisoners. The replies are as follows:

㊀ Opening up Speech: Many proposals mentioned this point, and it has also attracted the attention of the speech community in various places. The Central Government naturally attaches great importance to it. However, the Central Government has not restricted freedom of speech in the past. In addition to the provisions already stipulated in the Criminal Law and the Publishing Law, only the following three types cannot but be prohibited: 1. Speech and records that promote communism and endanger the country and disturb local public security; 2. Leaking military and diplomatic secrets; 3. Intentionally distorting right and wrong and fabricating rumors without any factual basis. Apart from these three, it is open and free, and it is also hoped that the whole country will respect legal freedom of speech. However, our country has a vast territory, and the opening up of speech in various places cannot be consistent. Often, the news that is permitted by the Central Government or released by the Central Government is not allowed to be released by local authorities. There are often complaints in the speech community. It must be known that the Central Government respects freedom of speech and does not want to have unexpected restrictions. In the future, we should follow this theme and improve the management of news and publications, and we should further support the development of the speech and publishing industry, so that the speech community can make full contributions under the premise of not betraying national interests. Now that the local authorities also have this kind of request, it is hoped that the local authorities will do so consistently in the future. For the news that the Central Government allows to be released, it must not be prohibited casually, so that all the news in the country can be communicated to every part of the country, so as to achieve the effect of unified will.

㊁ Concentrating Talent: Recently, various parties have paid much attention to this point, and it has also been discussed at the conference. In fact, the Central Government has been acting on this policy for several years. The Central Government not only wants to concentrate talent, but also wants to solicit talent from all sides to work together to save the country. However, we cannot follow the statements of the Communist Party and the so-called People's Front, so that politicians who repeatedly speculate and those who disturb the country, incite the provinces, and undermine unification can all take the name of concentrating talent as a stepping stone to hunt for official positions. The Central Government believes that the talents that the country urgently needs at present are experts who can truly contribute to all cultural and economic construction of the country, and are not limited to those who are good at writing and speaking, let alone those who rush around to engage in politics. It must be known that if this kind of concept is not corrected, China cannot advance to become a unified and progressive modern country. Therefore, the Central Government's policy in recent years is not only to concentrate talent, but also to nurture talent and encourage talent. For encouraging true talent, it is not about giving them official positions, but about enabling talents in various places to exert their special abilities and do various careers in various communities. The government has recently been subsidizing the careers of various provinces as much as possible to promote their development, which is to implement the Premier's will to make the best use of people's talents, and it is also to promote the construction of the country. The Chinese economic construction plan that was proposed at this plenary session has already been passed. The implementation of this plan does not know how many specialists and talents are needed. From a political point of view, the Central Government has recruited capable members from outside the party for ten years, and there is no discrimination against the various parties and factions before the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, let alone any intention to exclude them. Especially for domestic intellectuals and university professors with true knowledge and patriotic enthusiasm, we are humbly consulting and respecting them, hoping that they will contribute as much as possible in education and culture, and in various political and economic constructions, so as to nurture useful youth and complete the great cause of nation-building. Therefore, concentrating talent can be said to be a consistent policy of the Central Government, and it will be further realized in the future. All those who truly love the country and are willing to work for the country under the same goal will be respected, and we will welcome them.

㊂ The Issue of Pardoning Political Prisoners: The national crisis is at the current stage, and the work of nation-building is so urgent. The Central Government must be broad-minded and forgiving in order to bring about peace and stability. There have been many examples of leniency and exemption for those who have committed political mistakes in the past. However, the so-called political prisoners now are the Communist Party and reactionary elements who oppose the country and destroy society. For these criminals, there are certain regulations for self-renewal. Not a few of those who have been found to have signs of repentance and are allowed to be released on bail have already been released. Therefore, as long as these people truly realize their mistakes and no longer take advantage of this serious domestic opportunity to disrupt the country and undermine unification, and if they repent and renew themselves and have a guarantor, they can of course be given individual leniency. However, if we do not ask whether there is any sincerity in repentance and generally pardon everyone, then the Central Government, in order to attach importance to the laws and regulations of the country and ensure the peace and stability of society, will not casually issue this pardon. The government has the responsibility of the government, and leniency has its own method. We cannot be lenient without limits, and harm society by indulging. This should be understood by the people of the country.

In short, we must concentrate the will and strength of the whole country in the future, be sincere and frank, achieve unity and work hard with responsibility in order to save the current difficulties of the country. We deeply believe that patriotic people across the country will be able to support the resolutions of this plenary session and work together. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### National Government's Memorial Week

Chairman Lin Speaks on "Individual Freedom"

[Nanjing] The National Government held a Memorial Week ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Those present included Zhang Ji, Jing Tingyi, Zheng Jiayan, Wang Boqun, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, Chen Qitu, and other officials from the National Government's various departments and commissions, totaling about 400 people. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he gave a report. He first said that the important resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee have been seen in the newspapers. A declaration will be issued after the closing of the conference today, outlining how to proceed and make efforts in various aspects of domestic and foreign affairs, which everyone can understand by reading the conference declaration. Therefore, he will not report on the progress of the entire conference. He then gave a very detailed account of individual freedom and national freedom, which lasted for half an hour before the meeting adjourned. (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)

[Nanjing] Chairman Lin spoke on individual freedom and national freedom at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 22nd. The original wording is as follows:

"Fellow comrades, the Central Executive Committee held the Third Plenary Session a few days ago. The important resolutions of the entire conference have been mostly published in newspapers, and everyone can know about them. After the closing ceremony today, there will also be a declaration issued, outlining how to proceed and make efforts in various aspects of domestic and foreign affairs, which everyone can understand after reading the declaration. Therefore, I will not report on the progress of the entire conference today. I will speak on "Individual Freedom and National Freedom." In the third lecture of the Three Principles of the People, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Individuals should not be too free, and the nation should be completely free. When the nation can act freely, China will be a strong nation. To do this, the nation must sacrifice freedom." Dr. Sun Yat-sen meant that we should sacrifice individual freedom to fight for national freedom. The reason for this is very important now, so I am specifically raising this issue today to discuss it. What is freedom? Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Simply put, freedom is being able to move freely in a group." He also said, "After the fall of Rome in Europe, the autocracy of monarchs was very advanced until two or three hundred years ago, so the suffering of the people was also very serious and difficult to bear. At that time, the people of Europe, suffering from this lack of freedom, had to rise up and revolt to fight for individual freedom. The French Revolution was the result of this. After they gained individual freedom, they used laws to protect it. This is the origin of the freedom rights stipulated in the constitutions of various countries later. They were able to make good use of this kind of freedom right from the beginning, and they accomplished many things. Originally, the economic situation in Europe at that time was still very backward, and a large amount of manpower was needed for development. However, the people of Europe were able to use the power of freedom to do this kind of economic development, which led to the astonishing development of the economic situation later and indirectly promoted social progress. In this way, it can be seen that individual freedom has also made great contributions to human society in the past, which we cannot ignore. However, when individual freedom is exercised to the extreme, many弊害arise. The most obvious of these 弊害 is the disparity between the rich and poor classes. In order to avoid these 弊害, the current trend in the world is the opposite of the French Revolution. Everyone does not recognize that individuals have complete freedom. In politics, they impose various restrictions on individual freedom. In economics, there are ideas such as controlled economy to replace the doctrine of free competition. Recently, some people have even argued that the state is a higher-than-everything organic body, and that the individual is only an inseparable part of the state, with no independent purpose and should sacrifice for the state. From this point of view, it can be seen the trend of the world now. Furthermore, in our country, should we advocate individual freedom now? According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we individuals should not only be too free, but also sacrifice individual freedom. There are several points that can be distinguished in this: First, it is because we originally had a very full amount of freedom. An ancient Chinese saying goes, "Work at sunrise, rest at sunset, dig a well and drink, cultivate the field and eat. What does the emperor's power have to do with me?" These few sentences can prove that we have full individual freedom and do not need to seek further development. Second, the current trend in the world is not to talk about individual freedom. We have already said this earlier, so we cannot violate the trend of the world and talk about individual freedom again. Third, because we used to have too much freedom, most of it formed a sheet of loose sand without the power of unity, so when we encountered the oppression of external forces, we could not resist, resulting in the current situation. We have already deeply suffered from the harms of individual freedom and must find another way to remedy it. As for sacrificing individual freedom, there are also three points to say: First, our country is currently very unfree. If we want to ask for national freedom, we can only break individual freedom and form a very solid group to engage in struggle. Second, with social progress and increasing affairs, many of these affairs are not handled by individuals, so in fact, the scope of individual freedom of action cannot but be restricted. This is for the sake of protecting public welfare, and it cannot be otherwise. Third, when the country encounters extraordinary events, in order to be able to cope properly and achieve the goal of preserving national interests, the most important thing is that the people of the whole country can obey the leadership of the state and act in unison, so individual freedom must also be temporarily sacrificed. There are precedents for this in European and American countries. Otherwise, if we want to expand individual freedom at this time, it will disperse the strength of the country and increase the difficulties of the country. In short, in the past, because we had too much freedom, it formed a sheet of loose sand without organization, so we were invaded by other people. Now, if we want to resist this aggression, everyone must be able to sacrifice individual self-reliance, form a very solid group. Recently, the government has been carrying out baojia etc., which is also to organize everyone together, implement the goal of unity, and complete national freedom. In the future, after the entire country gains freedom, we can then promote individual freedom again, and that will be practical." (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)

Current Commentary

### The Closing of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee

-- Du

The Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, which has attracted the attention of the whole country, was declared closed yesterday. This session of the conference, held after the Xi'an Incident, and during the brewing of a temporary truce, faced a situation where popular sentiment was wavering and strategies were uncertain, all of which required the conference to stabilize and decide upon. The responsibilities it bore were heavy, and the expectations pinned on it were profound. Therefore, before the start of the conference, all members of the Central Executive Committee were willing to overcome long distances and enthusiastically participate. In the conference hall, they were also able to avoid superficiality and concentrate on discussion. What they demonstrated to the people of the country was indeed the utmost effort towards unity. What we are anxiously waiting for is the determination of domestic and foreign policies, so that there is a direction to follow. Many important proposals in this conference, the resolutions of which have appeared in the newspapers, such as the report and handling of the Xi'an Incident, the resignation and retention of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the decision on the timing of the convocation of the National Assembly, and the authorization to amend the election law of representatives, are all conclusions that we urgently want to obtain. Now that we have obtained approval in principle, we cannot but look forward to future leaps forward. Public expectations are satisfied, and there is no room for criticism. Among them, there is one that is even more captivating in the eyes of the general public and has infinitely profound implications, namely the proposal on eradicating the "Red Menace" put forward by the presidium of the conference. This proposal is not only considered a very important issue by everyone in the country, but even foreign observers, if they have any concern, must also be anxious and attentive, holding their breath to watch the development of this situation.

Today, when external aggression is increasingly urgent, the slogan of concentrating China's strength has long been understood by the entire country. Unless one has ulterior motives, who would not hope for its realization? What is meant by concentrating China's strength is that all people of the Republic of China should tend towards unity and avoid the dissipation of will. All material resources of the Republic of China should be carefully conserved and not used for unnecessary sacrifices. Under the goal of resisting aggression, all grievances should be eliminated, and all opinions should be融化. Only in this way can we save the nation and seek survival. Without this, we can never rectify danger and stabilize the situation. It is a matter of natural justice and cannot be denied. Since the Communists are part of the people, they should understand this meaning deeply and jointly maintain the overall situation. Unfortunately, past events have often failed to achieve mutual understanding, causing the panic of the "Red Menace" and dispersing the strength against foreign forces. Now, reading the proposal of the presidium of the conference, which says, "The Communist Party, after being in a desperate situation, has advocated the saying of sincerity and acceptance of orders. We should embrace them with benevolence and never cut off the path of self-renewal," it seems that the Communist Party has realized that the past was not a good plan, and is secretly planning to show sincerity and accept orders. Although how they got there is still difficult to know the truth, this indication of theirs should be a definite fact. Furthermore, observing the methods of showing sincerity stipulated by the central government, such as abolishing all organizations that undermine unity and stopping class struggle and Red propaganda, are all able to make serious instructions based on practical necessities. If the Communist Party has a sincere intention to cooperate, there should be no place that cannot be followed, then the "Red Menace" can be eradicated invisibly, and the whole country can achieve complete unity. This is indeed the greatest harvest of this conference. However, without the Central Committee's virtuous intentions being far-reaching, how could this be achieved? The Central Committee, for several years, based on its purpose of striving for unity, has always taken tolerance and magnanimity to heart. In dealing with the Guangdong-Guangxi dispute in the past, and in handling the Xi'an Incident more recently, it has always sought to preserve the overall situation and deliberately make concessions, and was finally able to move people's hearts and mediate the crisis. To this day, even the Communists, who are said to be as incompatible as water and fire, have shown sincerity and come to seek cooperation. Therefore, from now on, there will be no more worries about domestic division and disintegration, and we can also permanently avoid the embarrassment of being stretched thin when facing the enemy together. We are not smart, but we can only offer our sincere prayers, hoping for the realization of the Communist Party's sincerity and for the success of national unity.

### Spanish Government Forces Score Three Victories in One Day

City of Oviedo Recaptured, Key Passes Captured North and South of Madrid

Madrid: The government forces won three major victories yesterday in a single day, greatly improving the overall war situation. First, the city of Oviedo, the capital of Asturias Province, was captured by the local militia formed by workers of the province. The city of Oviedo had been occupied by the Nationalist forces for several months, and the government forces had been attacking it for a long time without success. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the government forces began their offensive again, first using artillery to shell the Nationalist positions. The militia composed of miners from Asturias Province then launched a charge, and other teams cut off the Nationalist communication lines and occupied various military strongholds outside the city. The Nationalist forces inside the city, under the command of General Aranda, resisted fiercely, but the miners continued to advance and broke into the city. At this point, all areas inside the city were in the hands of the government forces, but street fighting continued. Second, yesterday, government forces advanced towards the town of Morata de Tajuña in the Jarama River area southeast of Madrid and captured several new positions, which allowed them to control the Nationalist communication lines between the cities of Maranoza and Madrid and Talavera. Third, government forces in Avila Province, northwest of Madrid, occupied the town of Valdemaqueda, which threatened the city of Cebreros and the communication lines between the former Nationalist Qian and the city of Avila. After that, the Nationalist forces' plan to advance on the city of El Escorial would have to be abandoned. (22nd Havas Telegram)

Almería: After the government forces and the Nationalist forces engaged in a fierce battle in Guétjar, the government forces suffered heavy losses. The government forces announced today that they had gained a commanding position in the Sierra de las Puercas, about 20 miles northwest of Motril along the coast, and were able to maintain communication between the seaport and the mountains. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Telegram)

### Fierce Fighting in Jarama River Area for Days

Heavy Losses for Rebel Army

Madrid: A special report from our correspondent. The fighting in the Jarama River area south of Madrid was extremely fierce this morning. Although the government forces' artillery fire was extremely fierce, the Nationalist forces, especially those with automatic weapons, were still able to concentrate in one place to plan an attack. As of today, the fierce battle in the Jarama River area has lasted for eleven days. The Nationalist forces have suffered extremely heavy losses, and several elite units have been wiped out. General Miaja, chairman of the Defense Committee, told our correspondent that the fighting in the Madrid area will be prolonged, but the rebel army lacks soldiers, while the military strength inside Madrid is very sufficient and will never surrender under any circumstances. (21st Havas Telegram)

Avila: A special report from our correspondent. Several government artillery teams in the southern suburbs of Madrid bombarded the rear of the Nationalist positions, but were destroyed by Nationalist artillery fire. The cannons used by the government forces were made in the Soviet Union, and each cannon could fire four shells at a time. (21st Havas Telegram)

Avila: Our correspondent learned from the Nationalist authorities that there had been no changes in the war on the Madrid front in the past week. At this time, the Nationalist front line starts from the town of Villaverde in the southern suburbs, goes east along the lower reaches of the Manzanares River to the town of Vaciamadrid, crosses the confluence of the Manzanares and Jarama Rivers, and then goes along the Valencia Avenue, with a distance of 600 meters in most places and only 4 meters in a few, to the south of Arganda del Rey, then passes through the town of Morata de Tajuña to the town of Nuevo Baztán, and then follows the right bank of the Jarama River to the towns of Anchuelo and Sena. The Nationalist forces are now consolidating their positions along this front line. After the Valencia Avenue was occupied by the Nationalist forces, it has not been retaken by the government forces. Madrid is now isolated and helpless, and its fall is inevitable. In addition, two aircraft belonging to the government forces flew over the city yesterday afternoon and dropped bombs. Nine soldiers and civilians in the city were killed and the number of injured is unknown. (21st Havas Telegram)

### Rebels Complete Preparations for General Offensive on Madrid

Reinforcements Added, Weapons Sharp

Madrid: The rebels' preparations for a general offensive on Madrid seem to have been completed today. General Franco has concentrated 5,000 reinforcements south of the capital, most of whom are German and Italian. The Associated Press has learned from reliable sources that the rebels have recently transported many cannons and hundreds of new machine guns. The government forces tried to destroy the rebels' newly added cannons yesterday, but the outcome is unknown here. Fibbs News Agency reported that 1,000 people were killed or injured in the battle of Oviedo yesterday. The city is still being contested by both sides. (21st National Telegraph)

### Over Ten Thousand Militiamen Captured After Fall of Málaga

Duke of Seville Appointed as Governor-General

Málaga: According to a communiqué issued by the Nationalist Command here, since the fall of Málaga on February 9, the Nationalist forces have captured over ten thousand enemy militiamen to date, hundreds of whom have been executed. American expatriates have now telegraphed the Washington government, saying that Málaga is gradually returning to normal and that the local American consulate should reopen its doors. After the fall of Málaga, the Nationalist forces temporarily appointed the Duke of Seville as the governor-general of the area. (Central News Agency 22nd Reuters Telegram)

### Various Countries Ban Volunteers from Going to Spain to Fight

Seemingly Favorable to Rebel Army, Russia and Germany Have Already Implemented

Salamanca: Today, people here feel that the virtual ban by Europe on foreign volunteers entering Spain will be favorable to General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces. It is believed that the government forces and the International Brigades must now fight against the insurmountable advantage of the Nationalist forces. Since volunteers cannot continue to flow to Madrid, the Spanish Civil War, which has lasted for seven months, seems likely to end soon. (Central News Agency 22nd Reuters Telegram)

[Moscow] The Soviet government passed a resolution today banning people from going to Spain to join the war. The order banning volunteers from entering Spain also came into effect at midnight yesterday. Twenty-seven countries have now joined the resolution of the Non-Intervention Committee in the Spanish Civil War and are abiding by it. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Telegram)

[Berlin] Today, the German government promulgated an order prohibiting people from joining the war in Spain and forbidding people from traveling in Spain and Spanish Morocco. People who are not of German nationality may not pass through German territory to go to Spain to participate in the war. Anyone suspected of volunteering to join the war will be detained at the border. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Telegram)

### Non-Intervention Committee to Convene Again for Discussions

[London] It is expected that the governments of the twenty-seven countries participating in the London Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War will implement the ban in the next few days, fulfilling the agreement that took effect on Saturday night. As a result, no troops can be recruited in those countries to participate in the Spanish Civil War, and volunteers cannot set out or pass through those countries to go to Spain. As for the measures for maritime and land monitoring to prevent violations of the agreement, no agreement has yet been reached, but the existing difficulties are currently being adjusted. According to the agreement banning foreign troops from going to Spain to participate in the war, which took effect on Saturday night, it was stipulated that the monitoring system should be implemented from midnight on March 6.

### Lion and Bull Fight

Advertising Allure, Bullfighting Arena Reduced to Ashes

Mexico City: The "Progress Bullfighting Arena" in Guadalajara Province advertised today's spectacle as a fight between a fierce lion and a brave bull, using moving words in advance to make it a big draw. The crowds were indeed moved by it, and the number of people who bought tickets to enter the arena was extremely crowded. When they reached the arena, the so-called brave bull was actually a calf. Before it had time to resist, the lion opened its gluttonous mouth and swallowed it whole. The audience realized that they had been deceived, and the crowd was furious. Bricks and stones flew in the arena, and some opened fire with pistols. Finally, the crowd set fire and reduced the bullfighting arena to ashes. (21st Havas Telegram)

### The Minister of the Army Reiterates the Necessity of Increasing Troops in the Diet

Also Defends That There Is No Intention of Aggression Against China; The Government Avoids Conflict with Political Parties; The Budget Bill is Expected to Pass the Diet

[Tokyo] Today, the Minister of the Army explained the recent domestic and international situation, the strengthening of armaments in the Far East, and the state of armaments in Europe at the House of Peers and Representatives. He then stated that although the Soviet Union claims to be reducing armaments, it has not actually done so. Moreover, the Japanese army, and especially Japanese armaments, cannot compare with the fifteen divisions of the Soviet Far East Army in terms of defense. The Minister of the Army also said that Japan can only strengthen its military force, and first must strengthen its air force, second, increase armaments in Manchuria, third, increase troops in Manchuria, and fourth, prepare operational materials. (Daimeng Telegraph, 22nd)

[Tokyo] During today's afternoon session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Mr. Makino of the Seiyukai party requested an explanation of the mainland policy. Army Minister Sugiyama Gen categorically stated that the military does not place special emphasis on mainland policy, and what it considers urgent is: ① to engage in the sound development of "Manchukuo"; ② in view of the inseparable relationship between China and Japan, to promote economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. Sugiyama also solemnly declared that the army does not even have a plan for aggression against China. (Central News Agency Telegraph, 22nd)

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives is scheduled to stop questioning at the Budget Committee on the 25th, convene subcommittees, and then hold a general meeting on March 3rd to decide on various matters. Up to today, members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have discussed the increase in the allocation of funds for adjusting local finances, the revised budget, and the contradictions in Finance Minister Yuki's finances at the Budget Committee, and have touched on their core points. Although they are dissatisfied with the government's perfunctory responses, they have not exerted any power, so no concrete results have been achieved. The Budget Committee is simply proceeding peacefully on its scheduled course. Only the increase in the allocation of funds for local finances and the issue of the return of the budget form to the government have the potential to stir up a low pressure. Not only the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, but also the Proletarian party and small factions are pursuing these two issues from the same standpoint. Some have strong opinions, insisting on a resolute attitude regardless of the current government's attitude, so the depth of this issue is gradually increasing as they continue to debate it two or three times, and it is possible that small waves will inevitably occur. However, the government has stated in the Diet that it intends to submit the permanent solution to the local allocation issue to the next Diet for discussion, recognizing that the gradually determined budget of 70 million yen for the twelfth year is no less than the plan of the previous cabinet, so it is trying to avoid immediately increasing the amount, requesting understanding on the condition of establishing a permanent solution. As for the issue of the budget form, although Prime Minister Hayashi stated at the Budget Committee on the 20th that he would study this issue, it is difficult to clarify the reduction of 23 million yen each for the army and navy budgets from various perspectives, so he is determined to proceed with the initially decided policy when submitting the amendment. Therefore, the more political parties pursue this issue, the more the confrontation between the government and the Diet intensifies. However, based on past situations, it is doubtful whether political parties can dare to advance towards the government. According to general observations, it is almost certain that the political parties and the government will implement a political compromise and the budget bill will be approved. (Daimeng Telegraph, 22nd)

### Seeking Peaceful Resolution of the Keelung Incident

The Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Answers Questions from Diet Members

[Tokyo] At today's meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives, when a certain member of the Seiyukai party discussed guaranteeing individual rights, he again mentioned the incident on October 7th of last year in Keelung, Taiwan, where three British sailors and one officer were beaten and insulted by Japanese police. The Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs replied that the authorities have already investigated this matter in detail, but there is no evidence to support the British account of the situation at the time. He also said that this matter is still under negotiation, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now working to resolve this incident peacefully. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)

### Japan Will Devote Efforts to Adjusting Relations with Britain

[Tokyo] Because of Britain's attitude towards Japan after the establishment of the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact, the Japanese government believes that this has an important bearing on Japan's future diplomatic policy, and is paying close attention to its superficial and underlying actions. According to recent information from various sources, the current situation in British diplomatic circles has changed since the establishment of the Japan-Germany Pact. The opinion of the British Foreign Office tends to advocate re-examining the previously insufficient understanding of Japan policy. Britain is compiling a huge national defense budget, and from the perspective of practical considerations, is reflecting on its excessive attitude towards Japan. In this extraordinary period in Europe, it intends to reform the previous Eden diplomacy, that is, Britain is compiling a large national defense budget of 1.5 billion pounds for a five-year plan to confront Germany, in order to prevent any regrets. At this time, Japan's cooperation with Germany will inevitably promote the strengthening of Germany, and internal discussions have occurred within the British government advocating changing its diplomatic policy. From this perspective, it is almost certain that Britain will adopt a policy of preventing Japan from entering the German camp. Therefore, regarding the discussion of Britain's national defense strengthening and abandoning Anglo-Japanese friendship, it used extreme nervousness to deny this claim through Reuters communications. As for the China issue, although Britain has not been without a cooperative attitude with Japan in the past, the Japanese government has decided to consistently adopt a calm attitude and pay close attention to Britain's actions towards Japan. In short, there will inevitably be frequent exchanges between Japan and Britain around the time when Prince Chichibu, the Emperor's younger brother, visits Britain this spring. The Japanese government has already sent instructions to Ambassador Yoshida in Britain to collect information from all sides, and at the same time has decided on a policy to adjust relations between the two countries. (Daimeng Telegraph, 22nd)

### Inaugural Meeting of the Japanese Proletarian Party

[Tokyo] The Labor-Farmer Proletarian Council, led by House of Representatives member Kato Kanju, held its first national convention at the Shiba Ward Coordination Hall yesterday. 350 representatives from across the country attended. The meeting proceeded under strict vigilance from the police authorities. As a result, it was decided to rename the Communist Party the "Japanese Proletarian Party." However, the movement guidelines for a unified anti-fascist movement and the convention declaration, etc., that they resolved were all deleted by the authorities. (Daimeng News Agency Telegraph, 22nd)

### Germany Refuses to Participate in Raw Materials Conference

[Berlin] The League of Nations Administrative Council previously decided to establish a committee on the issue of raw material allocation, with representatives from fourteen countries as members, responsible for studying the issue of re-distributing world raw materials. The committee is scheduled to meet in Geneva on March 8th. Now, the German government has notified the League of Nations Secretariat that Germany has decided not to participate in the committee. People here explain that the reason for Germany's adoption of this decision is that the issue of raw material allocation is related to many issues in politics and economics, so it cannot be studied separately. However, some speculate that the raw material allocation committee is affiliated with the League of Nations, and since Germany is not a member of the League of Nations, it has made this decision. This aspect is not concealed by the general public in Germany. (Havas Telegraph, 22nd)

### Signing of the German-Polish Trade Agreement

[Berlin] The German-Polish trade agreement was officially signed in Warsaw today. The agreement stipulates that the mutual import quotas between the two countries will be increased to 176 million Zlotys (Polish currency), of which 27 million is trade between Danzig and Germany. The validity period of the agreement is set at two years. (Havas Telegraph, 22nd)

### Neurath Arrives in Vienna; German-Austrian Talks Begin

Exchanging Frank Opinions on Various Political and Economic Issues

[Vienna] German Foreign Minister Neurath and his party arrived here this morning and were warmly welcomed. Neurath's first action after arriving here was to lay a wreath at the Austrian War Memorial. (National Telegraph, 22nd)

[Vienna] At noon, German Foreign Minister Neurath, accompanied by German Minister to Austria Papen, visited Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt and State Chancellor Schuschnigg one after another. Afterwards, the Austrian Chancellor hosted a banquet for them, and Foreign Minister Schmidt accompanied them. During the banquet, various planning issues related to the political and economic affairs of the two countries were discussed in a friendly spirit. (Havas Telegraph, 22nd)

[Vienna] Today, when German Foreign Minister Neurath arrived in Vienna, Austria, members of the Austrian National Socialist Party held a grand gathering to express their welcome. Wherever the German Foreign Minister and his delegation passed by car, members of the National Socialist Party gathered and shouted "Long Live Hitler!" Although 3,000 Austrian police officers were temporarily dispatched, they could only maintain traffic and were almost unable to cope with the actions of the masses. Many people were arrested. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)

[Berlin] The attitude of official circles here towards German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria can be glimpsed in the commentary of the semi-official newspaper "Foreign Traffic News." The newspaper said that all German people support this visit, just as they warmly welcomed Austrian Foreign Minister Dr. Schmidt's visit to Germany in November last year. It also stated, "The significance of this visit is not only an ordinary exchange between friendly countries, but is actually a visit by an important German figure to the capital of another Germanic country." Its important significance lies not in seeking to adjust the foundation of the relationship between the two Germanic countries of Germany and Austria, because after the signing of the treaty on July 11, 1936, this foundation already exists. The current hope is to make this foundation more secure and to bring practical benefits to both countries politically and economically. Neurath's visit proves that Germany does not want to give up any opportunity to enhance the spirit of sincere unity between the two countries. This visit will also help to implement the agreement signed on July 11, 1936. (National Telegraph, 21st)

### Close Associate of the Polish Army Inspector General Issues Right-Wing Declaration

Denouncing Communism as Incompatible with the Polish Spirit; National Defense Relies on Organized Economic Life

Warsaw - Colonel Koc, a close associate of French Army Inspector General Rydz-Śmigły, issued a broadcast declaration today, clarifying that the concept of the state should be based on ensuring the existence of the state. Therefore, the people should end internal strife, and national defense should be guided by one person according to the internal needs of the country. Koc also said that communism is completely incompatible with the Polish spirit, and national defense actually relies on the organization of economic life. Minorities account for 30% of the total population. If their actions do not violate the interests of the state, they will be respected. Koc finally asked the Polish people to wholeheartedly and single-mindedly assist the state, so that the disciplined strength led by one person can be successful. Koc stated that his remarks today are based on the declaration made by Inspector General Rydz-Śmigły in May last year. According to Rydz-Śmigły, he is the successor designated by the late dictator General Piłsudski. Judging from Koc's declaration today, Poland is about to become a disguised autocratic state. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)

Warsaw - Colonel Koc, the leader of the Polish veterans, recently called on patriotic people from the national army to organize the national front. He delivered a radio speech, announcing the main points of the front's political program, roughly stating: The national front should be placed under the protection of the army, and national defense should be the primary task. Communism in Poland has been completely eradicated in 1919-20, and there is no room for it now. As far as the economy is concerned, the national front should protect private property and individual creativity under state supervision, so that "Poland will never have class struggle." In addition, the national front will also improve the situation of farmers and develop urban industry to accommodate the surplus rural population. (Havas Telegraph, 21st)

Lloyd George, who served as the German Chancellor during the European War, is also expected to speak in the debate. George recently returned to London last week after a long period of rest on the British island of Jamaica. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)

### Italian Government Orders the Conscription of One Million Men

Testing the Effectiveness of National Mobilization; The First Response to Britain's Military Expansion; Italy Increases Military Preparations Pending Decision by the Supreme Party Meeting

[Rome] The first response from Italy to Britain's expansion of armaments is to order the conscription of five classes of men in the country, totaling about one million people. All men born between 1900 and 1904 are subject to conscription. Once the date and location are announced, they must report on time. The purpose of this conscription is to test the effectiveness and speed of Italy's mobilization plan. After these conscripted men report, they can still be sent home if there is no reason to keep them in the camp. Furthermore, the Fascist Supreme Council will meet on March 1 to discuss the military situation. It is said that the meeting will make more important decisions regarding the general strengthening of the Italian military, especially the strengthening of the air force.

Italian Governor-General Slightly Injured in Assassination Attempt; Albanian General Ambushed and Killed

[Rome] According to an official announcement from Rome, Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, General Graziani, has been recovering well since he was attacked in Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, the other day. In this assassination attempt, Graziani was only slightly injured, but his subordinate, General Liotta, was seriously injured and has now had a foot amputated. Since this case occurred, 2,000 people have been arrested by the police in Addis Ababa, and will be interrogated one by one by the military law officer in order to find the culprit. Currently, the suspected areas of Addis Ababa have been cleared by the Fascist inspection team. Addis Ababa is guarded by 30,000 Italian troops. Most of the people in Addis Ababa are still calm. When this assassination occurred, General Graziani and his subordinates were distributing goods to the poor in churches and monasteries. Some Albanians who were dissatisfied with Italian rule mixed in with the crowd and threw bombs at Graziani and others, injuring Graziani and General Liotta, as well as many Albanians standing nearby.

### Posthumous Honors for Ordzhonikidze

Solemn Funeral Ceremony

[Moscow] After the death of People's Commissar of Heavy Industry Ordzhonikidze, a funeral was held in Red Square. Stalin, various important figures of the Soviet government, ambassadors and ministers from various countries, and tens of thousands of people attended the funeral. The ceremony was very grand. After the cremation of the body, the urn containing the ashes was built into the walls of the Kremlin Palace, and placed with the ashes of the former Secretary of the Communist Party, Kirov (who was assassinated in December 1934). Pravda recently published a eulogy for Ordzhonikidze, and explained the cause of death, stating that during the Tsarist era, Ordzhonikidze engaged in secret revolutionary work while in exile in Siberia and abroad. After the revolution succeeded, his vigorous work led to illness, which was the distant cause of death. Down to the present, it was the hateful Trotskyist elements that took Ordzhonikidze's life.

[Moscow] Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov and People's Commissar of the Army Voroshilov both attended and delivered eulogies. In his speech, Molotov said, "Under the leadership of Ordzhonikidze, Soviet heavy industry has now been transformed into a powerful force in the world, and the national economic and technological construction of the Soviet Union has been laid on its foundation." Voroshilov said, "If the Red Army can become the world's most powerful army, it is due to the technical equipment and weapons configuration that can adapt to various modern needs. For this reason, later historians will often give credit to Ordzhonikidze." (Havas Telegraph, 20th)

### Large Number of Traitors Arrested in Chaoshan

A Certain Foreign Firm Openly Gambles During New Year; Many Traitors and Smugglers Flock There

Shantou Correspondence: Chaoshan is a coastal area with many foreign firms established in recent years. Traitors and smugglers are rampant, colluding with hooligans, trafficking drugs, gambling, and engaging in all sorts of criminal activities. The foreign firms, relying on their special backgrounds, not only engage in smuggling but also undertake special tasks. Now, the Chaoshan Industrial and Commercial Anti-Smuggling Association has been successively established, and the people are voluntarily severing ties with traitors and smugglers, establishing anti-smuggling regulations, mutually guaranteeing surveillance, and encouraging each other to prevent the transportation of smuggled goods. The foreign firm traitors and smugglers are therefore fundamentally struck by this. Recently, they have been devoting all their efforts to drug trafficking and gambling, colluding with traitorous elements, and establishing various secret organizations to achieve their goals. During the Lunar New Year, the military police in Shantou and various Chaoshan-Meizhou villages strictly enforced the prohibition of smoking and gambling. In recent days, many ignorant gamblers have been arrested in various counties, districts, and villages. The military police put paper hats on their heads and paraded them through the streets as a warning to the public. Hearing this, the people became cautious and dared not test the law. However, in Shantou city, the hotel of a certain country's firm, relying on its gunboat as a protective symbol, openly and blatantly attracted traitors and hooligans who had connections with it to come in to smoke and gamble. As a result, the hotel was crowded with carriages and horses. Inside, there were fan-tan, pai gow, dice, mahjong, poker, and all kinds of gambling tools, all readily available. A national of a certain country guarded the entrance, shouting and making noise all night long. Especially after New Year's Eve, it was most lively for several consecutive days. Inside, there were also female attendants, wine, dishes, and opium lamps. Xue Hanguang, the director of the Shantou Public Security Bureau, believes that these shameless people are relying on foreign powers to harm the country, which is truly the most shameless act. It is completely different in nature from ignorant women and children stealing free time to gamble. Therefore, he specially dispatched dozens of plainclothes detectives to lie in wait near the gambling foreign firms. Whenever any Chinese people went inside to gamble and smoke, they would be arrested and taken back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation after they finished gambling and left. In several consecutive nights, more than 160 people were arrested and sent to the correctional facility for detention and interrogation. When they were escorted, the situation was very serious. Each person's hands and feet were shackled with three sets of iron fetters, treated as national traitors. The citizens who saw this all applauded. The extent to which these traitors had connections with people from a certain country varied. Some acted as agents for smuggled goods, while others indirectly undertook special tasks. If these internal traitors are not wiped out in one fell swoop, the foundation of spiritual national defense cannot be established. The Chaoshan garrison will arrest all those who come forward and interrogate them together for cross-examination.

### Changshu

Collapse of the Dike at the Japanese Willow Sluice Gate

The Willow River is an important trunk river in this county, discharging excess water from Taihu Lake and attracting the Jiang tide. It is related to the water conservancy of seven counties in Jiangnan, including Suzhou, Changshu, Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, Wuxi, and Cheng. As it is dredged and silted up from time to time, the nearby fields are affected. Last March, with the approval of the Yangzi River Water Conservancy Committee, the National Economic Committee allocated 300,000 yuan to build a giant sluice gate to facilitate opening and closing. In addition, a section of the Willow Dike was filled in and a new dike of about half a mile was opened. Unexpectedly, the dike embankment was not firmly constructed, and the Jiang tide was turbulent, causing the two banks to shake and collapse. Now there is a danger of breaches, and farmers have already suffered considerable losses. The district chief has urgently telegraphed the county government to forward the report to the higher authorities, requesting that measures be taken to repair it.

### Suzhou

Second Day of the Cultural Relics Exhibition

After the opening of the Canglang Pavilion Cultural Relics Exhibition, visitors included Gu Shusen, director of the Ministry of Education; Teng Ruoqu, counselor of the Executive Yuan; Wang Diancun, professor of the Central Political School; Xiang Shaoxuan, chief of the Education Application Section; Yi Junzuo, editor-in-chief; Deng Zhexian, principal of the Industrial School; Shao Heting, principal of Suzhou Middle School; Zhang Hanwei, chief of the Police Bureau; and more than two thousand people. This cultural relics exhibition not only demonstrates the superiority of Wu's culture and art in the Southeast but also highlights the noble spirit of Zhou Zhongjie and the extraordinary filial piety of his son, Zi Pei, which is worthy of emulation by visitors. The "Blood Memorial" by Zhou Zipei (Maolan) on display at the exhibition was written by Mr. Zhou out of grief over the death of Zhongjie in prison. In the early years of Chongzhen, he wrote a memorial in blood to redress his father's grievances. Because there were taboo words in the memorial, he changed the manuscript before submitting it. However, the blood from his finger had dried up, so he used blood from his tongue instead. He finally cleared his father's name. The original manuscript is still treasured today, and the bloodstains are still fresh, showing his boundless filial piety. Visitors were all moved by it. There is a postscript by Shi Gong at the end of the memorial, which is also related to historical materials of the time. It is a collection of the Xu family. All members of the Suzhou-Shanghai Literature and Art Society, including Zheng Yimei, Jiang Hongjiao, Xu Bibo, Zhao Mianyun, Tao Lingyue, Fan Yanqiao, Fan Peiyu, Zhou Shoujuan, Gu Mingdao, Cheng Xiaoqing, Zhou Kerang, Fan Jugao, Fan Junbo, Cheng Zhanlu, Sun Licheng, Liu Junran, Xu Yunqiu, Fang Shenchang, and dozens of Suzhou calligraphers such as Wu Daichiu, Fan Shaoyun, Chen Jiamin, Gu Moqi, and Zhao Ziyun, visited the cultural relics exhibition and had a grand gathering for a meal and photo session at Canglang Pavilion. In the afternoon at three o'clock, they went to the Net Master's Garden to attend the Jiangsu Modern Literary and Art Writers Promotion Association. More than ten people from the Third College of Literature of Daxia University are scheduled to come to Suzhou on the 26th to visit the provincial social education institutions. All members are scheduled to come to Suzhou on the 22nd to visit the cultural relics exhibition and gather at the Suzhou Museum. President Yu of the Control Yuan will come to Suzhou on the 23rd with key central figures to visit.

### The True Meaning of National Salvation Through Unification

— Liu Shi

After national salvation through unification becomes a practical national front, the development of this front will go through many struggles. I think Mr. Luo must know this better than I do. In recent years, the unification movement led by Chiang Kai-shek has achieved today's results, and how much rhetoric, running around, and struggle has been spent? Even the Xi'an Incident, how much compromise was spent on this peaceful resolution! This material is still very fresh! Isn't this a struggle? This is just the beginning of unification—there are already struggles in strategy and tactics here. Unfortunately, in the past, we did not establish a common front first, so the struggle often went off track, leading to the unfortunate Xi'an Incident, which almost caused a big mistake. With the major premise of unification established, although the struggle will still be, as I said, an "undeniable fact," it will not go beyond a certain track. Its development will follow the development of the national war of resistance. Why do I regard the "united front as a process of struggle?" I am only observing the results based on the actual actions of various social forces in practice, not a static state. Movement is dynamic, it is developing! Every social force must express its characteristics in the movement. In unified action, a strategy and a tactic must be determined through various discussions, and a correct strategy is often obtained after countless arguments. Truth is often born in struggle, so I say, "The united front can be said to depend entirely on this struggle for its survival and development." "To unite but fear internal struggle and avoid due struggle cannot be beneficial to the united front but is a disloyalty to the common sacred war." I am confident that I have made this clear. The internal struggle I am talking about is by no means a reckless proposition to use the means adopted in the Xi'an Incident to destroy one's own camp in the united war of resistance. I never thought that this meaning would be misunderstood by Mr. Luo.

I don't know if the above explanation has dispelled Mr. Luo's misunderstanding, but I am grateful to Mr. Luo for this opportunity to explain these words again. I ask myself that I and Mr. Luo are both friends on the same path of saving the country, and we have never met before, so there is no personal grievance at all. Mr. Luo's misunderstanding of me mainly comes from confusing the People's Front with the National Front. I think that after this explanation, there is generally no reason why we cannot understand each other!

However, I still cannot restrain myself from speaking. Today, there are still many people in Chinese society who are patriotic but have a very vague understanding. Many people cannot have a concrete outline of the true meaning of national salvation through unification. In the past, many unfortunate facts and incorrect concepts often played with and influenced people, hindering the connection between people and becoming an obstacle to spiritual unification. One of these obstacles is the narrowness fostered by erroneous concepts, which limits people with a heart to serve the country from walking on the path of saving the country. This is what I often find most painful. Today, there are still people with deep prejudices who wear colored glasses to look at people and love to add colors to others for no reason, transforming them into a decomposition of national power. Even if the world's original intention is for the country, the result will invisibly create chaos and indirectly help the enemy. Writing this, I can't help but shed tears. Today, all people with national consciousness should truly reflect on themselves and correct this bias!

Finally, I want to shout long live the unification of the entire nation to save the country, and form a closely-knit national front! Oppose the People's Front that does not conform to China's national conditions! And the traitorous front that sells out China! And pay national salute to Mr. Luo! (End)

There are also about 20,000 to 30,000 people who have not been registered, so the total number has reached more than 80,000. There are currently 500 to 600 service personnel. Each city and county in the province has one Scout instructor, and each school has at least one instructor, all appointed by the Provincial Department of Education. However, due to economic and talent relations, the Scout Council of the province has not yet been formally established.

### Important West League Matches This Weekend: French Business vs. Loyola

Saturday at the Recreation Ground Will Surely Refresh the Eyes of Fans; Tung Wah vs. Western Captures on Sunday at the Municipal Stadium

This week's West League football has four Group A matches. The important match is French Business vs. Loyola on Saturday at the Recreation Ground. These two teams are currently the strongest. Loyola's strength is completely different from when they first came to Shanghai, making people look at them with new eyes. French Business has only drawn once since the start of the season and has the highest hopes for the championship. Although Loyola has lost twice and drawn twice, they have already lost hope for the championship. However, this match will provide fierce competition for French Business and can be called one of the most exciting scenes of this West League season. Tung Wah plays against Western Captures on Sunday in the city center and should be able to secure a victory. The other two matches are Jinnan vs. Lax and Shakur vs. Western Business. In the Sunday league, Jinde has already secured the championship. This week is the final battle to complete its entire order. The opponent is the Jewish team, which is also a strong team. Although it has nothing to do with the championship, there should be a fierce battle. It will be at 10:45 AM at the third field in Hongkou Park. The current order and Group A situation for this week are as follows. Last Saturday, in the West League Group A football match, Loyola defeated Western Business by a large margin of nine to zero in the rain at the Racecourse. The current situation in Group A is as follows:

### Haiqing Loses to Russian Army Due to Underestimation

West League Group A Championship Shaken

The Haiqing team, the reigning West League Group A volleyball champion, lost two games last night to the strong Russian team, their rival from the previous season, by scores of 15 to 10 and 15 to 8. From then on, Haiqing, who had the highest hopes for this championship, has been shaken, and the one who will reap the benefits is the West League Russian team, who has lost to the West League once. Su Ke is not worth mentioning. Haiqing has not been successful since the start of this season and was almost defeated by Su Ke last time. However, this battle is a double round robin, so if they can double their efforts, the situation may still be salvageable. In short, whether Haiqing can retain the champion seat will depend on the success or failure of next week's battle against the West League, which will determine their final fate.

### World Women's Swimming Record: Denmark Threatens the Netherlands

(National Maritime News Agency, Amsterdam, 20th) Danish female swimmer Helvig has repeatedly set new records, causing panic in the local water sports scene, worrying that the Danish team will seriously threaten Dutch female players.

It is pointed out here that Helvig has broken the Dutch swimmer Odun's 400-meter prone record and holds the world records for 500-meter, 800-meter, and 1,000-meter prone. Moreover, the Danish team is not limited to Helvig alone, which makes the local sports scene even more uneasy. The local area has fully understood the efforts of Danish women's swimming pioneer Peterson in training young female athletes, because the results of Dutch swimming over the years are also the result of the efforts of Mrs. Braun, the "Mother of Dutch Women's Swimming."

### A Message to the Chinese Nursing Community (Continued)

— Li Lingdong

㊂ Ensuring Career Continuity: If we want the nursing profession to exist forever, we must have concrete measures to ensure the profession, because the salary earned by nurses each month is so meager that it can only provide for monthly living expenses, maintaining the status quo of living for a month. In fact, there is no possibility of savings. Once they exceed the age of forty, their physical evolution causes them to enter old age, and their duties and work efficiency fluctuate accordingly. There is a risk of unemployment. Once unemployed, they have no special skills to engage in other professions. They cannot succeed in business and cannot find employment. Inevitably, there is a risk of starvation. Therefore, if there are no measures to guarantee the future of the profession, people will not be eager to study nursing. The nursing profession can never develop, and the nursing profession will eventually collapse and perish. The survival of the nursing profession is only a matter of time. Therefore, it is hoped that the leaders of the Nursing Association will not ignore the implementation of career security as insignificant and that the establishment of preventive medicine is of the same nature. In the future, please carefully study and pay attention to it.

㊂ Words for Future Partners.

The wheel of the times is constantly unfolding the "survival of the fittest" scenario. The light of youth passes easily, burying the rapid pace that turns the hair of young people into snow-white pigments. When we are nursing students, we must first recognize ourselves as reserve forces preparing to serve society and transporters storing food. How to work hard to learn skills, build character, and tightly grasp time and the times, not allowing it to flow away like water, disappear, and waste the past. Do not be influenced by the subconscious of society, seeking vanity and admiring extravagance. We should establish our own good character, knowledge, and healthy body and mind. We need to be good students and good citizens, which is our only life philosophy.

Tomorrow's nursing education is innovating day by day, and the nursing profession is also difficult to manage with the times. If you pass through your studies carelessly and have no strengths, you will not be able to stand firm in the present era and society and will eventually be eliminated. Future partners! Get up! How will you inspire and cheer yourself up, bury your head and work hard in the short three years to prepare for the needs of serving society in the future? Only by quoting a sentence from the Four Books: "Zeng Zi said: ... I examine myself three times a day ..." can we use it as a constant reminder. Even when serving society, we should grasp two kinds of consciousness:

㊀ The Attitude of a Scholar: If you do not have the attitude of a scholar when serving society, not only will you not receive developmental achievements in your career, but you will also inevitably feel the pain of mechanical life in your career, a perfunctory job. If you serve society with the eyes of a scholar, you will feel interested at every moment. The pursuit of life, exploring its cause, pursuing its research, serving for decades is equal to one day, and at the same time the career is progressing day by day.

㊁ The Mind of a Child: The mind of a child can be said to be pure, curious, enthusiastic, forward-looking, and humble. If we, as members serving society, all have the heart of a child, corrupt officials and old clerks, engaging in private gain and fraud, will not arise. The actions of children are based on conscience, and they will not be hypocritical, flattering, or despicable when treating people and things. Therefore, the heart of a child, if adults never lose the good heart of a child, their lives will be more poetic and happy day by day. So let the mind of a child burn! Let it be hidden in the hearts of people serving society! That's right.

### Standards for Choosing Nutritious Foods for Tuberculosis Patients

— Zhong Zhihe

Pulmonary tuberculosis (commonly known as consumption, phthisis) is a type of wasting disease. It is caused by the active invasion of tubercle bacilli into the human body, resulting in impaired systemic nourishment. Consequently, patients gradually become emaciated and weak, exhibiting a haggard and frail appearance. If no urgent measures are taken to remedy and maintain their condition, the situation will inevitably worsen, eventually leading to a point of no return, like a lamp running out of oil. Therefore, to compensate for their depletion and maintain their nutrition, we must choose and consume foods rich in nourishment. Only then can we speak of nutritional therapy.

However, if patients are not careful and indiscriminately consume food in an attempt to increase their weight and replenish their losses, it is like supplying inferior coal to a locomotive. The result will only be a sharp reduction in driving speed, delaying important matters. From this, it can be seen that the selection of nutritious foods for tuberculosis patients is indeed a crucial and significant hinge, and one that deserves careful attention. The standards are now listed below for the reference of doctors and patients:

(A) Milk

The benefits of milk for tuberculosis have long been recognized. Aretaeus elucidated this principle eight hundred years ago. Milk is extremely rich in protein, and its quality is also excellent. Furthermore, the various amino acids it provides are essential components for nourishment. Therefore, doctors often recommend milk as a nourishing food for tuberculosis patients.

In addition, milk also contains a large amount of fat, minerals, and vitamins, including vitamins A, B, and C. One pound of milk has the same metabolic combustion value in the human body as one pound of lean meat or eight eggs. Who would say it is not a standard and most economical nutritious food? For ordinary patients, an average of one to two pounds of milk can be consumed daily.

Patients who cannot tolerate raw milk often experience abdominal pain, bloating, belching, and diarrhea after consumption, leading doctors to suspect ulcerative enteritis. However, if milk is discontinued when these symptoms occur, the symptoms can be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, a saline solution, such as adding one-fifth to three-fifths of limewater to dilute the milk, can be used to avoid the presentation of indigestion symptoms. Sometimes, mixing it with finely ground rice cereal or rice porridge makes it easier to digest.

According to Atwater's experiments, when milk is taken alone, the digestion rate is 92.2% for protein, 86.3% for carbohydrates, and 92.8% for fat. However, when taken with bread, the digestive power increases to 97.1% for protein, 98.7% for carbohydrates, and 95% for fat.

Furthermore, the minerals contained in milk are also abundant, and they are all essential components that should not be lacking in the daily nutritious food of tuberculosis patients.

(B) Eggs

Eggs are extremely important in the nutritious food of tuberculosis patients because they are rich in protein, fat, and minerals. Whole eggs contain 75% water, 13% protein, and 12% fat. In total, the egg white accounts for two-thirds and the yolk accounts for one-third.

A whole egg weighing 50 grams has the same nutritional value as 35 grams of beef or 128 grams of milk. The yolk contains 25% fat and 15% protein, as well as nuclein, lecithin, iron, other salts, and cholesterol, which have the effect of strengthening the body and nourishing the blood.

One pound of egg white can produce 250 heat units (calories), while one pound of egg yolk can produce 1,700 heat units. In other words, one pound of eggs can produce more than 700 heat units.

We all know that excessive fat consumption often leads to liver congestion, and excessive meat consumption easily causes kidney congestion. The harm of excessive egg consumption is equivalent to that of excessive fat and meat consumption.

Ordinary patients often like to eat raw eggs, believing they have greater nutritional value. However, according to research, raw eggs are not easily digested and can even cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Egg white that is heated to 37 degrees Celsius is easier to digest. Furthermore, patients whose stomach and liver functions are disordered and cannot tolerate eggs should not be forced to eat them, as it will be more harmful than beneficial, which is neither what doctors want nor what patients enjoy.

Occasionally, some people have a specific sensitivity to eggs, and even eating one egg can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. This is an exceptional phenomenon, and stopping consumption will cure it. There is no need to fear. Those whose stomach, liver, and other organ functions are not disordered can eat four to six eggs daily, with remarkable results.

(C) Soy Milk

Soy milk (commonly known as tofu whey) is made from ground soybeans and water. Its value as a nourishing product has long been recognized by the Chinese. Soybeans contain the most protein of all grains, and their content is no less than that of meat. However, they contain very little fat. Therefore, it can be used to replace milk for those who dislike milk or have a specific sensitivity to it. In addition to milk, tuberculosis patients can still consume soy milk once or twice a day. It is also a cheap, high-quality, and universally economical nutritious food. The analysis of its components is as follows:

Fat: 2.5%
Protein: 5.4%
Carbohydrates: 1.2%
Water: 90.9%

(D) Protein

In tuberculosis patients, the action of tubercle bacilli causes toxemia, which severely destroys and damages human tissues, especially muscles. To compensate for this, an appropriate amount of protein must be introduced. Approximately 1.5 grams to 1.75 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is needed daily. Animal protein is better than plant protein because animal protein is more easily assimilated in the human body.

Tuberculosis patients can eat an average of three-quarters to one pound of animal food per day. However, the most suitable and complete food is one pound of bread (or an appropriate amount of rice), three eggs, two pounds of milk, eight ounces of tomatoes, four ounces of fresh vegetables, and one pound of fruit. One pound of beef contains about two to three ounces of protein, and one pound of fresh halibut or cod contains one and a half to two and a half ounces of protein.

(E) Fat, Carbohydrates, and Minerals

Fat is also an important nutritious food, with cream cheese, milk butter, etc., being the best. Their effect is similar to that of cod liver oil, but it is not advisable to eat them directly.

Carbohydrates are indispensable nutritious foods because they are easily digested and assimilated in the human body.

As for minerals such as iron, calcium, sodium, magnesium, and phosphorus, they are extremely important elements in human blood and tissues and can be obtained from various foods to nourish the human body.

(F) Vitamins

Vitamins were not valued by doctors until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Researchers generally believe that nutritious foods, in addition to protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals, also contain more important nutritional elements that are necessary for human health. In 1905, Pekelharing fed mice cheese protein, rice flour, lard, water, and salt. As a result, the mice still starved to death despite having food. Later, when he replaced the water with milk, the mice became lively and healthy. He concluded that milk must contain an incredibly important nutritious component that is essential for the human body. Later, in 1912, McCollum and Davis discovered vitamin A through experiments, which has an extremely

## Page 12

important effect on human health. Lack of this substance makes the human body susceptible to infectious diseases. Later medical research revealed that it is also extremely important for tuberculosis.

Vitamin B is also extremely valuable for tuberculosis because it has a special effect on the motor nerves in the human body. Research has shown that tuberculosis patients who lack vitamin B are prone to insomnia. Furthermore, patients often develop beriberi during the course of tuberculosis, and the prognosis is often poor. Therefore, to prevent this, they should eat more foods rich in vitamin B.

Vitamin C is a common tonic and has a beneficial effect when used for tuberculosis. Schraaedre proved that vitamin C deficiency is inevitable when suffering from tuberculosis. Hasselbach further proved this through various examinations, stating that hemoptysis in tuberculosis patients is caused by increased capillary permeability, resulting in mild, moderate, and easily recurrent hemoptysis. Taking more vitamin C can reduce bleeding.

Vitamin D is extremely important for the absorption and metabolic regulation of calcium and phosphorus in human blood and bones. Therefore, taking it helps tuberculosis patients by causing the lung damage to tend toward calcification and promoting and assisting in the gradual reduction of the disease.

Most tuberculosis patients need the following average daily food intake:

(1) Protein: 100 grams
(2) Fat: 80 to 100 grams
(3) Carbohydrates: 400 to 500 grams

The various components contained in nutritious foods and the heat they supply are listed below.

### Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)

— Zhou Mengbai

3.  Japanese Swertia (Swertia japonica, Makino)

(Plant) It grows wild in the mountains and fields and is a biennial herb. The stem has many branches, is square, and can reach up to 20 cm in height. The leaves are opposite, without stalks, and are narrowly linear with entire margins. In autumn, white flowers grow at the top or from the axils. The corolla is deeply divided into five lobes and has purple stripes. The capsule is linear. The entire plant has a prominent bitter taste.

Chinese Swertia (S. Chineosis, Hemel, et Forbes) closely resembles Japanese Swertia. It is slightly larger, and the branches are also shorter and thicker. The flowers are purple.

(Crude Drug) Swertia Herb (Herba Swertiae) is the entire plant of the above two species, collected and dried during the flowering period. This product is up to 20 cm long. The stem is square and dark purple. The branches and leaves are arranged oppositely. The roots are yellowish and quite thin, with numerous divisions. The leaves are narrowly linear, without stalks, and entirely green. It has an extremely bitter taste.

(Components) The bitter component is Swertiamarin C16H22O10, a crystalline glycoside with a content of 2.4%. This substance, due to the action of acid and Emulsin, undergoes hydrolysis, as in the following formula:

C16H22O10 + H2O → C6H12O6 (Glucose) + C10H10O5 (Erythrocentaurin) + 2H2O

Erythrocentaurin is directly detected from the plant. If it is hydrolyzed from the glycoside, it may not be generated. This substance is originally a colorless crystal, but it turns red when exposed to sunlight, which is its characteristic.

It also contains Swertiasaure C27H42O3, Gentisin C14H10O5, Swertisin C13H10O6, and other tasteless crystalline substances.

(Medicinal Use) Swertia (as described in ancient medical texts) is used exclusively as a bitter stomachic and to make stomachic powder.

### Developing Medicine Requires the Chinese People to Understand New Medicine (Part 2)

— Xia Chengdao

As for the saying that "old doctors have unique skills," this is easy to answer and is the most important key. Old doctors only know how to treat diseases with medicine, but they do not know that medicinal products are not absolutely necessary for treating diseases. The Chinese people must know that medicinal treatment only occupies a part of the position in the treatment, in addition to drug therapy, there are also nourishing therapy, balneotherapy, cold therapy, heat therapy, climate therapy, mineral spring therapy, air therapy, barometric pressure therapy, sun therapy, high mountain therapy, artificial light therapy, radium therapy, psychotherapy, blood transfusion therapy, and so on, countless therapies, all of which are the most ingenious and precise scientific products. How could an old doctor sitting in a well and looking at the sky dream of this? The so-called unique skills of old doctors are only in drug therapy, after thousands of years of experience, such as being able to stop pain, rhubarb can lower the stool, they do not understand what the reason is, but also know its use, is to know what is, but do not know why. Sun Yat-sen, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, said it well, "It is easy to do what you know, and you can do what you do not know." The old doctor knows what is, which is why the old doctor has no experience. If the drugs with thousands of years of experience in our country (including the so-called secret recipes and the family recipes that are passed down to men but not to women) can be studied with scientific methods, it will definitely make a great contribution to the world's medicine. Only then can the essence of the country be carried forward, and only then can the country be glorious!

Old doctors must replenish the kidneys when treating spermatorrhea. It is really ridiculous to say that old doctors think that sperm comes from the kidneys, so in the pharmacies, kidney-tonifying pills and essence-solidifying pills are advertised in a flurry of rhetoric, but they do not know that sperm comes from the seminal vesicles, and the nerves are weak, and the seminal vesicles are not managed properly, so that the semen is easily lost. The kidney is the filter tank of blood and the place where urine is produced, which is the so-called excretion organ. If you suffer from spermatorrhea and do not treat it, it is the source of nerve weakness. Specializing in tonifying the kidneys is really irrelevant!

The old doctor said that "the heart is the master of thought and perception," which is another joke. How did they know the function of the heart, like the water pump of a water company, which sends blood to the whole body by contracting and relaxing, presiding over the circulation of blood? All of this is based on many experiments. According to the old doctor's theory, the brain is simply a waste. Why don't they dig out the brain, which is a heavy waste on their heads?

Old doctors still cannot clearly understand the functions of their own human organs. How can they be qualified to be doctors? For example, if a clock repairman does not understand the structure of the clock and the functions of each part, you will definitely not want to give him a valuable clock for repair. Occasionally, he will add a little oil, and the clock will be able to run as a result. This is his little experience, which is the effect of oil. This does not mean that he has the skills to repair clocks!

In summary, the old doctor's metaphysical theories of yin and yang are completely wrong. In this scientific world, the Chinese people should correct them. Their thousands of years of experience in drug treatment is useful to a certain extent. In other words, "China originally had no medicine, only drugs," that is, the theory of old doctors should be eliminated, and Chinese medicine should not only be preserved, but also studied and manufactured by scientific methods, so that it can be exported to other countries for the treatment of the world.

Decades ago, the situation in the medical and pharmaceutical circles in Japan was the same as in China today. What's more, people who advocated scientific medicine were shot. Finally, due to the progress and struggle of the scientific community, and the Chinese people's ability to take the overall interests of the country as their goal, have a long-term vision, and humbly accept the world's science, used to build the country, and reorganize medicine, the whole country united, and today Japan's medical and pharmaceutical industry has squeezed into an important position in the international arena, competing with Germany, Britain and the United States. Looking back at the national conditions of our old and backward country, it really makes patriotic people heartbroken!

Whether the country's politics can be on the right track depends on the level and vision of the people. From the beginning, the government officials of our country thought that they understood everything, talked about everything, were capable of everything, and specialized in everything, but as a result, they specialized in nothing, and held many positions, which only delayed the country's affairs. The national administration has thousands of things to attend to, and although people are the spirit of all things, their spirit is limited, their time is fixed, and only division of labor and cooperation, the more detailed the division of labor, the more specialized the career, the more sufficient the spirit, the greater the efficiency, the faster the progress, and the prosperity of the country and the strengthening of the army can be achieved as soon as possible. In summary, now that we have entered the era of tutelage and construction, we should do meticulous work. In other words, in this construction period, we need to use ingenious and meticulous tools—specialized talents in various subjects and categories—in order to truly and effectively build the country from a wasteland!

### Report on Health Inspections in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, etc. (Part 2)

— Chu Jinfang

Introduction

In modern countries, health undertakings are really one of the most important administrations, because the international status often depends on the health of a country's nation. Our country has been weak for a long time, and if we want to gain a foothold in the international arena, we must seek the prosperity of the nation. If we want to seek the prosperity of the nation, we must first complete the construction of health.

In recent years, European and American countries not only advocate health undertakings in front of the government, but also support them in the rear. Once an infectious disease occurs, the people all have common sense of isolation, disinfection, and prevention, and can abide by the guidance of health administrative organs and prevent it according to law, so the disease rate and mortality rate have significantly decreased.

In recent years, our country has been actively promoting health construction, but it has not yet been popularized. Health undertakings, small things are related to personal interests, and big things are related to the rise and fall of the nation, which cannot be ignored and should be studied.

Hospitals and clinics have been widely established in various urban and rural areas of our city, and the equipment is gradually becoming perfect, but it still focuses on treatment, and on the facilities for the prevention of epidemics, such as spring smallpox vaccination and cholera vaccine injection, although they are implemented free of charge every year and are effective, but such as maternal and child health, and health education, etc., still need to be actively promoted; In order to make the various health facilities in our city more perfect, we should consult widely and use it for reference, which is the main purpose of Jinfang's assignment to inspect health.

The locations of this inspection include Shanghai, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Hankou, Wuchang, and Changsha. Due to time constraints, I was unable to conduct a detailed investigation; however, I was able to get a glimpse of the important parts. Now, I will respectfully prepare a report on the inspection situation in the order of the itinerary:

### Italian Soldiers Destroy Shanghai Grand Theatre: Municipal Government Lodges Protest Yesterday

Besides Demanding Punishment for the Offending Italian Soldiers, [the Government] Reserves the Right to Claim Compensation for Losses; Consul Has Not Expressed Any Opinion, Details Carried in Various Newspapers; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Also Lodges Protest with the Italian Embassy

According to the New Sound News Agency, regarding the case of Italian soldiers destroying the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road, it is reported that the Municipal Government officially lodged a serious protest with the Italian Consulate in Shanghai at 5:30 PM yesterday, arguing that such violent acts by Italian soldiers, such as destroying the theatre, releasing tear gas, injuring the projectionist, and seizing the film, are sufficient to endanger the lives and property of residents. Besides demanding punishment for the offending Italian soldiers, the government also reserves the right to claim compensation for losses. It is reported that although there is no precise estimate of the theater's losses, they are estimated to be around 65,000 yuan. The theatre has decided to temporarily suspend operations until a resolution is reached. It is also reported that the theatre has fire insurance with a certain British insurance company, and the company also sent personnel to the theatre yesterday to investigate the situation and determine whether it should bear any responsibility.

After the incident occurred, the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Niro, immediately ordered all personnel in the consulate to refrain from expressing any opinions regarding the case. Therefore, when reporters from the Shen Shi News Agency went to the consulate, they were unable to obtain any information. Subsequently, when reporters requested to meet with the Vice Consul, Mr. Tianlei, and the Commercial Attaché, Mr. Qiuqi, they were told that both had already left Shanghai, and their current whereabouts could not be disclosed.

According to a Nanjing dispatch, the Shanghai Municipal Government has reported the details of the case of Italian sailors destroying the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telegram. According to Nanjing news last night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the Italian Embassy in China.

According to the Zi Lin Daily, the Italian sailors who destroyed the Shanghai Grand Theatre should be punished by Rear Admiral Basica, the commander of the Italian Navy in the Far East. Last night (the 20th), Mr. Basica stated on the gunboat Lepanto that he had not yet received any complaints regarding the actions of his sailors. He only learned about the details of the riot after reading the newspaper. He has only been stationed in Shanghai for less than three weeks and is naturally not familiar with the local political situation. However, regardless, he should first maintain military discipline. He is currently investigating the case. Mr. Basica also stated firmly that Italian soldiers stationed abroad generally behave well. The Lepanto only has eighty sailors, so the number of Italian soldiers who participated in the disturbance must be far less than initially expected. Furthermore, neither the Italian Embassy nor the Italian Consulate General in Shanghai has issued any official statement regarding the case. Repairs to the Greater Shanghai Theatre are currently underway. It is reported that the two injured Russian staff members are gradually recovering from their injuries yesterday.

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, regarding the case of Italian sailors destroying the Greater Shanghai Theatre, it is reported that no one has been arrested so far. It is not yet known what actions the Italian Consul General in Shanghai and the Commander of the Italian Navy in the Far East will take regarding this case. The Soviet Consul General in Shanghai also declines to comment on the case at this time. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government has lodged a serious protest with the Italian Consul General. Although rumors are rampant, all parties concerned are currently unwilling to formally criticize the case.

According to the Foreign Press Agency, on Saturday (the 20th) afternoon, the Shanghai Grand Theatre was destroyed by Italian soldiers while screening a film about Abyssinia. At the time, a Frenchman was present at the screening and witnessed the destruction. According to his report to this newspaper (referring to a French newspaper), "When the film started, I (the Frenchman referring to himself, the same applies below) was watching from the balcony. At first, there was nothing unusual. However, when the Abyssinian King appeared in the "Abyssinia" film, the Chinese audience applauded loudly. Then, a foreigner in plain clothes sitting in the front row of the balcony blew a whistle, and the film's projection light was immediately blocked by someone using clothing. At the same time, someone in the entire venue started throwing ammonia gas, intending to force the audience to leave. Thereupon, the lights in the venue were turned on, and I saw Italian soldiers in uniform, all over the place, holding wooden sticks and weaving tubes, engaged in destruction. Many of the seats in the venue were smashed. In the front row of the balcony, there was a foreigner, with what looked like a scar beside his eye, acting as the commander, issuing orders in Italian. The audience, suddenly alarmed by this, almost went crazy and, under the intimidation of the Italian soldiers, gradually left. At this time, I also saw a group of Italian soldiers and Italian civilians in plain clothes continuing to throw ammonia gas, but in reality, this gas was not harmful. I also suddenly heard a shout coming from upstairs. Looking up, I saw a group of soldiers, holding crowbars and carrying film reels, coming down the stairs from the projection room and walking away through the crowd. At that time, I left the theatre and saw several Chinese policemen nearby, maintaining order. However, there were certainly too few of them, and they could not interfere. In fact, I did not hear any gunshots. It seems that some people had foreseen this incident. On February 11th, Reuters had a dispatch from Rome, stating that because of the screening of the Abyssinian film, Italy intervened, based on a Sino-Italian film agreement, in which both sides guaranteed that films detrimental to either country would not be screened in their respective territories. However, this news has not been confirmed and seems to be a rumor. However, this destruction has now occurred. This is the third time that Italian soldiers have used force to interfere with anti-Italian films in Shanghai. Eight years ago, they seized an American film at the Xian Lu Theatre and publicly burned it on the Zha Pu Road Bridge. In 1934, they also forcibly seized a film about the European War that mentioned the defeat of Italian soldiers at the Carlton Theatre. Afterwards, these incidents were resolved amicably by the Public Concession authorities and the Italian Consulate General."

### Fifth Anniversary of Major Short's Righteous Death

Public Memorial Service Held Yesterday by Various Sectors

Major Short, an American aviator, driven by righteous indignation during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, bravely took to the skies in his plane to fight six enemy warplanes over Suzhou. He fought valiantly, but ultimately died due to the overwhelming odds. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese people mourned and admired him. Appreciating Mr. Short's righteous courage, the Chinese government later built a tomb for Mr. Short beside the Hongqiao Aerodrome in this city and erected a monument to commemorate him. Today marks the fifth anniversary of Mr. Short's death. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, various sectors of this city held a public memorial service in front of Mr. Short's tomb at the Hongqiao Aerodrome. Attendees included Tong Xingbai from the City Party Headquarters, Li Dachao from the Shanghai Branch of the China Aviation Construction Association, Huang Yanpei from the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Education Association, the Shanghai Air Defense Association, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Boy Scouts Council, the Su District Tax Police Bureau, the Hongqiao Air Force Station, and representatives from other groups, totaling over a hundred people. The City Party Headquarters, Garrison Headquarters, Naval Headquarters, China Aviation Construction Association, Shanghai Branch, Local Association, Air Force Station, Municipal Education Association, and other groups officiated at the ceremony, offering wreaths and performing the rituals. F.Y. Wagner, representing Mr. Short's family, delivered a speech, stating that she had come to Shanghai from the United States on behalf of Mr. Short's mother to participate in today's public memorial service. She was very pleased to see representatives from all sectors of China gathered here to pay tribute, and that the Chinese government had not forgotten Mr. Short's contributions. She would relay this information to Mr. Short's mother to comfort her and hoped that this spirit of righteousness would be perpetuated forever. Afterwards, the entire group took a photo and dispersed.

### First American Vessel Arrives After Strike

Service Resumes After Seventy Days of Suspension; First Ship is the President Hoover

After the American sailors' strike, American vessels in the Pacific suspended their voyages. Since the last arrival in Shanghai of the President McKinley on November 14th of last year, it has been seventy days without any American ships entering the port. The strike has also affected the arrival of American cargo in Shanghai for a long time. Since the sailors resumed work, the first American vessel to cross the Pacific to China is the President Hoover, a regular mail ship of the Dollar Steamship Lines from San Francisco to Shanghai. This ship is fully loaded with cargo and passengers from America to Shanghai, via Honolulu and Japan. It was telegraphed yesterday that it is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning. This is the first American ship to resume service to Shanghai after the seventy-day suspension, and it is also the first batch of American goods shipped from San Francisco to Chinese ports. Yesterday, various American merchants and trading firms inquired with the shipping company about the arrival time, preparing to pick up their cargo. Furthermore, it was telegraphed yesterday that the President Wilson is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th.

### Decision Made on Method for Reducing Rickshaws and Sharing Costs

Notification Issued to All Members to Comply

Regarding the matter of reducing the number of rickshaws in the Public Concession, an agreement was signed by both parties to extend the implementation date to June 1st. The rickshaw guild in the Special District decided on a method for reducing rickshaws and sharing costs at a meeting yesterday and issued a notification to all members to comply. The original text reads: "Notification regarding the following matter: As per the resolution of the general meeting of rickshaw owners at this office, an agreement has been reached with the Municipal Council to extend the deadline for reducing rickshaws from December 1st to June 1st. This office is responsible for handling the matter. All rickshaw owners will share the cost of reducing 484 rickshaws. The method for sharing costs has been decided as follows. Please comply: ㊀ All rickshaw owners holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates, regardless of the number of rickshaws they own, must submit all their rickshaw owner certificates to this office for registration by February 26th. This office will issue a receipt, which can be used to pay the relevant fees at the designated bank and enjoy the benefits of the extended rickshaw reduction program managed by this office. Otherwise, the Municipal Council will deduct the licenses based on the number of rickshaws owned by the rickshaw owner, starting from March 1st through a lottery. ㊁ Rickshaw owners holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates for one to ten rickshaws must pay monthly license and guild fees of 3.69 yuan in national currency and a rickshaw reduction sharing fee of 5 yuan in national currency at the bank from the 1st to the 6th of March, April, and May of this year, using the rickshaw owner certificate receipt issued by this office. They must then present the two bank receipts to this office to receive the license and operate. ㊂ Rickshaw owners holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates for eleven or more rickshaws must sign a guarantee at this office by February 26th and pay a rickshaw sharing fee of 15 yuan in national currency per rickshaw. Only then will this office stamp the rickshaw owner certificate receipt with the words "rickshaw sharing," allowing them to pay monthly license and guild fees of 3.69 yuan in national currency at the designated bank from the 1st to the 6th of March, April, and May of this year. They must then present the bank receipt to this office to receive the license and operate. After May 10th, the rickshaws to be shared will be determined, and the signed guarantees and rickshaw sharing fees will be exchanged. ㊃ If a rickshaw owner holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates for one to ten rickshaws has multiple certificates in the name of one person, one family, or one company, with the total number of rickshaws exceeding eleven, and wishes to share the rickshaws instead of paying the fees, they must apply to this office before February 26th. Only after approval will they be allowed to proceed in the same manner as rickshaw owners holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates for eleven or more rickshaws. ㊄ If a rickshaw needs to be replaced due to being stolen within a specified period and the owner wishes to use it to offset the rickshaw reduction requirement, the small ticket number of the stolen rickshaw must be submitted to this office for registration at any time to be reported to the authorities, allowing for an exemption from replacement and for it to be used to offset the rickshaw reduction requirement."

### Siamese Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Chune, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Conditions for Overseas Chinese in Siam are Very Good; Hoping for Early Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Siam

Mr. Chune Pintvanon, Secretary of the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who is on his way to Japan to inspect consular affairs, passed through Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3 PM aboard the French mail ship Felix Roussel. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the delegation to Siam welcomed him at the wharf. Mr. Chune also met with reporters and made a statement, which is recorded below by a Central News Agency reporter:

Arrival at Port

The Felix Roussel was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, but due to fog in the Wusongkou, it was delayed until 3 PM in the afternoon before arriving at the China Merchants North Bund Wharf. Those who went to welcome him included Yu Ming, Special Representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Jue and Zhao Tiezhang, Director and Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Kanghou, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation to Siam, delegation members Li Gan, Xu Ge Ting, standing committee member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Zhisheng and Madam Miao Zhongxiu, and others, more than ten people in total.

Departure for Japan Tomorrow Morning

After exchanging greetings with the welcoming party, Mr. Chune went directly to the New Asia Hotel to rest. At 8 PM that evening, Lin Kanghou, Deputy Head of the Delegation to Siam, delegation members Yu Ming, Li Gan, Wang Zhixin, and others, as a show of hospitality and to thank him for his previous hospitality, jointly hosted a banquet at the International Hotel with Zhou Jue, Zhao Tiezhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, to welcome Mr. Chune. Lin Kanghou, as chairman, delivered a welcoming speech. Today, Mr. Chune will be accompanied by Yu Ming to visit the construction in the city center. If the mayor returns to Shanghai, he will also visit the mayor. Mr. Chune is scheduled to depart for Japan on the original ship tomorrow morning.

Mr. Chune's Statement

Mr. Chune met with reporters on board the ship and stated that his trip to Japan was to inspect the situation of the consulate in Japan and is expected to last for more than a month. He will come to China again at the end of April and will stay for a while and visit the authorities in Beijing. Before passing through Shanghai, he had visited Singapore, Penang, the Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong and other places to inspect the consular situation. The situation of Chinese compatriots in Siam is very good. The Siamese government treats overseas Chinese the same as its own people. Regarding diplomatic relations between China and Siam, he also hopes that they can be established as soon as possible. (Note: Mr. Chune is an important member of the Siamese New Party and has made significant contributions to the revolution in the past.)

### Zheng Baozhao Discusses Inspection of Rice Panic in Guangdong

Annual Shortage of 10 Million Dan; Each Yuan Can Only Buy Six Jin

Liang Dingshu, Section Chief of the Rural Economics Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Lin Xichun, Section Chief, Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Shen Guojin, Section Chief, Wu Enzhi, Staff Member, Shi Jingchong and others, who were dispatched to Guangdong to inspect the rice shortage situation, have completed their work and returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2 PM aboard the French mail ship Felix Roussel. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Director Zheng on board the ship, and his statement is as follows: He was dispatched to Guangdong by order of the Ministry of Finance to investigate the rice shortage in Guangdong Province. Following Minister Kong's instructions, he first visited Wuhu at the end of last month and discussed with the Yuehan Railway the matter of increasing the number of trains to transport Hunan rice to Guangdong for relief. He then departed on the British mail ship on the 2nd of this month and arrived in Guangdong on the 5th. In Guangzhou, he repeatedly visited with various party, government, and military leaders of Guangdong, as well as leaders of the financial sector and organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and the rice industry, to listen to their opinions and convey Minister Kong's concern for the people's food supply in Guangdong Province. Guangdong Province has always been a rice-deficient province. According to investigations, it is short of approximately 8 million to 10 million dan of rice per year. Last year, the situation was even worse due to poor harvests of early, late, summer, and autumn rice crops in Guangdong, and the scarcity of foreign rice from Siam, South Vietnam, Burma, and other places due to active purchases by various countries around the world. Therefore, in November and December of last year and January of this year, there was no foreign rice market in Guangzhou. At the same time, various rice-producing provinces in China mostly prohibited rice exports. Although the central government issued a clear order to lift the ban and ordered the transport of rice to Guangdong for relief as much as possible, it was not enough to make up for the shortage in time, resulting in the food panic in Guangdong Province. The price of rice in Guangzhou in September of last year was already about 5 to 6 jiao per dan higher than in August. The price then rose gradually. In November, the market price of high-quality rice was 8 jin per yuan, and second-quality rice was 9.4 jin per yuan. By mid-January of this year, high-quality rice was only selling for slightly more than 6 jin per yuan, medium-quality rice for slightly more than 7 jin, and lower-quality rice for only 8 jin per yuan, which was the highest price in recent years. Subsequently, Minister Kong requested the government to order Hunan and Anhui rice to be transported to Guangdong for relief, and also ordered this bureau and the Central Trust Bureau to purchase Wuhu rice and transport it there. After approving the half-tax recording of 1 million dan of imported foreign rice, the price of rice in Guangzhou fell, and the degree of panic also gradually eased, which is not consistent with the situation reported outside. Therefore, the Guangdong authorities and people's organizations are very grateful to Minister Kong. Guangdong has now established a People's Food Adjustment Committee, which is actively purchasing rice from Hunan, Anhui, and Guangxi provinces and distributing it to twelve rice merchants in the city to conduct price stabilization and provide relief. There is no fear of panic in the near future. All the findings of this investigation will be compiled into a report and submitted to Beijing within a day or two.

### Jiang Dingwen Goes to Zhejiang to Meet Zhang Xueliang

Mr. Jiang Dingwen, member of the Central Executive Committee, attended the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Beijing. He left Beijing by special express train on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and arrived at the North Railway Station at 10:20 PM that night. He went directly to his private residence on Anhe Temple Road to rest. Then, at 8:25 AM yesterday morning, he took the Shanghai-Hangzhou early train to Hangzhou. Mr. Jiang will go to Fenghua to meet with Mr. Zhang Xueliang.

### Xu Ge Ting Returns to Shanghai to Talk About the Forthcoming Establishment of the Sino-Siamese Association

Negotiating with National Goods Company; Considering Navigation Between China and Siam

Xu Ge Ting, standing committee member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, recently went to Beijing to visit the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry to discuss matters such as the Sino-Siamese Association, Sino-Siamese navigation, and the development of national goods. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his work. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed him, and his statement is as follows:

The Sino-Siamese Association is About to be Established

Mr. Xu said that during his visit to Beijing, he visited Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ling Bing, Head of the Delegation to Siam, and made requests regarding the establishment of the Sino-Siamese Association in China. The purpose of this association is to seek the development of trade and culture between China and Siam. Siam has already established it long ago, and China is now actively preparing for it. The personnel have already been determined, about fifty or sixty people. All members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and all members of the delegation to Siam will be ex officio members. Chen Shuren will be the chairman, and ministers of various ministries will be appointed as honorary chairmen. The headquarters will be set up in the capital, and an office will be set up in Shanghai if necessary. It is expected to be established next month.

Negotiating with National Goods Company

There are a large number of Chinese compatriots living in Siam. The compatriots like to use national goods, so the development of national goods is imminent. Chinese merchants hope to establish a national goods company to handle all distribution matters. The National Goods Joint Operating Company of the Ministry of Industry will be established at the end of next month. At that time, the Joint Operating Company will cooperate with Chinese merchants, and the company will be subordinate to the Joint Operating Company. He will now stay in Shanghai to negotiate everything with the leaders of the national goods industry.

Sino-Siamese Navigation is Under Consideration

Regarding Sino-Siamese navigation, Mr. Vili, the Siamese commercial officer, once exchanged views with our authorities, intending to establish a shipping company to transport the national products of the two countries, and set the capital at 4 million baht (about 6 million yuan in Chinese currency). This matter is complicated and difficult to realize for a while. The simplest way is to extend the China Merchants Bureau's South China shipping route, which is simple and easy. It is reported that the Bureau is currently considering it. As for the hope that major banks will establish branches in Siam to facilitate remittances, it is reported that a major bank has started investigating the financial situation in Siam and is expected to be realized in the near future.

### Xiao Songqin Arrives in Shanghai from Siam on His Father's Orders

Visiting the Authorities in Beijing Today

Mr. Xiao Songqin, son of Central Executive Committee member Xiao Focheng, (reported as Xiao Songjian in the newspaper), was previously ordered by the Central Government to go to Siam to welcome his father back to the country to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. However, Mr. Xiao Focheng was unable to travel because his health had not yet recovered and he was very afraid of the cold. Mr. Xiao Jr. arrived in Hong Kong on the 4th from Siam and went to Guangdong. He took the French mail ship Felix Roussel north from Hong Kong on the 19th to report back. The ship encountered fog on the way and did not arrive in Shanghai until about 3 PM yesterday, mooring at the China Merchants North Bund Wharf on Broadway Road. Lin Kanghou, Wang Zhisheng, and others went to welcome him. After Mr. Xiao Jr. disembarked, he went directly to the New Asia Hotel to rest. Mr. Xiao Jr. brought four letters from his father to Sun, Ju, and Yu, the three heads of the Yuan, and Minister Kong. In addition to thanking them for their kind invitation, the letters stated the reason why he could not come to Beijing. President Jiang had previously telegraphed Mr. Xiao to return to China. It is reported that Mr. Xiao has already telegraphed back. Mr. Xiao Jr. is scheduled to go to Beijing today to report back to the Central Government and visit various dignitaries, representing his father to extend his greetings. It has not yet been decided when he will return to Siam. According to Mr. Xiao Jr., his father suffers from bladder problems, and urination becomes difficult when the weather is slightly cold, so he is very afraid of the cold. A month ago, the weather in Siam was about 95 degrees, but his father was still wearing a leather coat. Therefore, he could not come to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. His father decided to wait until the weather is warm and his health has recovered before returning to China. His father did not have any proposals for the Third Plenary Session, but he had previously sent a long letter to President Ju, conveying his personal opinions on national affairs to the comrades of the Central Government.

### Chinese Overseas in America Invited to Participate in the New York World's Fair

President of Oberlin College Sends Letter to Minister Kong Requesting Sponsorship - Fujian Hui Nursery's Exhibit Creates International Art World Record

The two representatives who participated in the Chicago World's Fair, Mr. Dong Kunfan and Mr. Dong Guangying, arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday. After the Chicago fair closed, the two traveled all over the United States to study education and industry. They arrived in New York, where they were warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese, and expressed strong support for the plan to participate in the 1940 New York World's Fair. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of New York specifically resolved to petition the Executive Yuan for sponsorship to ensure tangible results. According to what the two gentlemen told reporters, the details are as follows:

Chicago Expo Exhibits Highly Praised

China's participation in the Chicago World's Fair has been highly praised by the people there. Representative Dong, who attended on behalf of Fujian Province, said that among China's exhibits, the products of the Fujian Hui Nursery School won the admiration of the entire American press. The Chicago Pictorial News praised it as the focal point of the Chicago Expo. The famous American calligrapher Mr. Li Bo gave a speech at the conference, publicly praising it as creating a record in international art. After the closing of the fair, in response to invitations from various parties and to promote Chinese culture and art, they traveled around, and together with Mr. Ye Keliang, the Consul General in New York, donated more than a dozen silk lacquer statues of Chinese greats to the China-America Association to promote national culture and introduce lacquer statues to Westerners. They donated them to promote good relations, including a portrait of President Franklin, which was donated to Oberlin College and was highly praised. In particular, the president of the university, Mr. Weir Deng, knew that Minister Kong strongly supported this participation, and personally wrote a letter entrusted to them to present to Minister Kong to express his gratitude. A portrait of the scientist Edison was donated to the Edison Academy, a portrait of President Roosevelt was donated to the Roosevelt Memorial Hall, and a portrait of the female educator Jane Addams was donated to the public education center she founded. In addition, portraits of President Hoover, the oil magnate Rockefeller, the automobile magnate Ford, and the steel magnate Schwab were all presented to them in person, and motion pictures were taken.

New York World's Fair Invites Participation

New York will hold the Washington Founding Anniversary Exhibition in 1940 and has invited China to participate. New York is the leading city in the United States and the center of world trade. Participating in the expo in the future will be an excellent opportunity to promote national glory and sell domestic products. We have drafted a plan for the authorities to adopt, planning to use Fujian's existing silk and lacquerware to create relief murals, divided into past and present aspects. The past includes the Yellow Emperor's invention of the compass chariot, the Qin Shi Huang's construction of the Great Wall, etc. The modern includes Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of revolution, up to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's northern expedition from Shaoguan, and the national unification, etc., with more than 20 pictures in four styles of Chinese calligraphy. We will adopt the essence of the murals in the Italian Pavilion at the Chicago Expo and the Japanese Shotoku Memorial Picture Gallery, as well as the historical murals of Roosevelt's meeting with the American Defense Family in the White House, extracting what can be used as our reference to promote and carry forward our inherent style. At the same time, we will develop durable lacquer materials, thereby improving and developing the future of Fujian lacquer. In addition to participating in the New York World's Fair, this work will be listed as a basic exhibit for participating in exhibitions in various countries. After the closing ceremony, it should be transported back to China and displayed in the Capital Museum or Art Gallery for the public to view, echoing the Japanese Shotoku Memorial Hall.

Overseas Chinese Petition for Support

Overseas Chinese in the Americas strongly support this plan and have sent a letter to the Executive Yuan stating, "The United States 1939 World's Fair has been decided to open in New York in May of this year, with meticulous preparations and a grand scale. In particular, New York is the largest city in the world and the hub of European and American transportation, making it a golden opportunity to explore overseas trade. Recently, Mr. Dong Kunfan, the executive director of the Chinese Products Exhibition Association for participation in the Chicago World's Fair and the special commissioner for product collection in Fujian Province, and Mr. Dong Guangying, the director of the liaison section of the Products Exhibition Association, arrived in New York to study the infant industry and investigate matters related to the 1929 World's Fair. We, the undersigned, residing overseas, believe that this undertaking is extremely important and will promote the development of domestic industry and commerce and serve as a promotion for overseas trade. Mr. Dong and others displayed exhibits in 1933 and 1934, which not only highlighted the essence of Chinese culture and art, but also fostered friendly relations with the American people, earning high praise. Mr. Dong and others, with their experience and the results of this investigation, are confident in the 1939 participation plan. We respectfully request that your government strongly support this participation, which will not only bring glory overseas but also benefit the livelihood of the people." Chen Tianran, Chairman of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of New York, Li Shengce and Chen Guangyao, Chairmen of the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association, Chen Zhengbo and Huang Huayao, Chairmen of the Hip Sing Association, and Li Gongyu, Chairman of the Chinese United Association of Eastern America.

### Commander of the U.S. Patrol Fleet, Marquis, Will Take Office Today

Rear Admiral Marquis, the new commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet, arrived in Shanghai from the United States yesterday on the transport ship Hunter Liggett. The inauguration ceremony is scheduled to take place at 10:00 am this morning on the warship Luzon. Mr. Marquis was formerly the commander of the Sixteenth Naval District and the Cavite Naval Shipyard in the Philippines. The current commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet, Rear Admiral Allan, has been in office for two years and will return to the United States with his family to take up his new position soon after the handover. The arrival of the Hunter Liggett is of great help to the U.S. Naval Reserve in Shanghai, because since the U.S. shipping strike, the group of people who retired and received pensions have not received remittances of monthly salaries sent from the United States for two months. The ship will stay briefly in Wusong to allow several officers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment to land, and then it will sail to Qinhuangdao, because the ship carries officers and soldiers of the U.S. Embassy and some U.S. troops stationed in Tianjin, who need to be sent to replace the soldiers whose current term has expired. Then, around the 28th of this month, it will carry several hundred white soldiers to Shanghai to replenish the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai.

### Income Tax Office Issues Notice on Withholding Tax Methods

The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance Affairs Office yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that it had received Instruction No. 109 from the Ministry of Finance Income Tax Affairs Office regarding the first category of profit-making business income tax and store employee salary income tax, stipulating three withholding methods, which are excerpted below: (1) In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the first category of Class A and Class B profit-making businesses should be settled once a year and report their income within three months after the settlement. The start and end dates of the business year should be determined by the customs of each industry. The old habits of using three or five years as the settlement period should be abolished. (2) The office will not intervene in whether or not interest should be stipulated for the shares of store owners, but the net profit should be calculated first at the end of each accounting period, and the tax payable should be reserved in advance in accordance with the tax rate stipulated in Article 3 of the regulations before dividends can be distributed. (3) The practice of long-term advances for store employees is a kind of habit and seems not easy to abolish, but if the salary is calculated on a monthly basis, then the income of 30 yuan or more per month should be withheld income tax according to law on a monthly basis. If it is calculated on a seasonal, semi-annual, or annual basis, and the average monthly income is 30 yuan or more, then income tax should be withheld when the salary is paid. If the actual amount of salary is not stipulated, but bonuses are distributed at the end of the accounting period, then the corresponding income tax should be calculated and withheld based on the average monthly income when the bonus is paid. The letter is sent to you for your information and to inform all industry associations.

### Bankers Association Sends Letters to Banks to Complete Reporting Procedures

Reporting Deadline at the End of February - Forms Can Be Obtained from the Office

All reporting forms have been announced by the Shanghai Income Tax Office (Shang Zi No. 1) and distributed by the association on January 15. Subsequently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce negotiated with the Income Tax Affairs Office to extend the deadline to the end of February this year because the deadline at the end of January was too short. There are not many days left before the deadline. I am sincerely afraid that some banks in the association have not yet reported, so I will notify you again. Please complete the reporting procedures within the deadline. If there are no ready-made reporting forms, you can go to the Shanghai Income Tax Office to obtain them. Please check and handle accordingly."

### Forcing Two Girls into Prostitution and Extreme Abuse

Two Girls Seek Help in Desperation; Chen Shengcai Arrested for Investigation

Chen Shengcai, from Anhui, resides at No. 54, Weixing Lane, Taopeng Road. Between July and August of last year, in collusion with his concubine, Han Landi from Huzhou, he lured Wu Guizhen, a 20-year-old woman, and Sun Anfu, an 18-year-old woman, from Huzhou to Shanghai. Under the pretext of introducing them to work in a cotton mill, he deceived them into staying at a hotel in the middle of Hankou Road and forced the two girls to go to ships in the Shiliupu area to engage in prostitution, catering to customers' desires and spending nights with them. Chen Shengcai and Han Landi received and spent the earnings. Later, when the two girls refused, Chen threatened them with disfigurement by splashing nitric acid on their faces, forcing them to continue their prostitution. Subsequently, due to declining business, they moved to Chang'an Hotel in Yangshupu to sell their bodies. Any slight disobedience was met with beatings, and Wu was even splattered with excrement on her face. The two girls, enduring unbearable suffering, reported the situation to the Jianlin Road Police Station on the previous morning. Detective Xie Wanfang and officer Peng Zhenxuan were dispatched, and Chen was arrested. Upon questioning, it was revealed that his concubine, Han Landi, was hiding at No. 182, Singapore Road, in the Chinese-administered area of Caojiadu. The detectives, together with the local police, apprehended Han and brought her to the station for detention. Yesterday morning, Chen was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. A lawyer from the Public Works Department, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case and requested a postponement to bring Han in for a joint trial. Subsequently, Wu Guizhen and Sun Anfu testified to the events and questioned the defendant, whose statements were evasive. Judge Lu Lin ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.

### Li Weiqing and Others Accused of Fraud

Dispute over the Smuggling Intelligence Bureau

Li Weiqing, from Shanxi, who previously served as the director of the Ministry of Finance-approved pilot Smuggling Intelligence Bureau (which had a brief existence last summer before being dissolved) and is currently employed at the Central Bank, was recently sued in a criminal case at the Shanghai District Court by Gan Zhaoting, from Hunan, a former team leader of the Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi Wang counties district under the bureau. The suit accused Li Weiqing, along with Li's chief of general affairs, Xiong Xiangtao, and secretary, Hu Zhefu, of obtaining money through fraud. The court accepted the case. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Both the plaintiff and the defendants, accompanied by their lawyers, were present in court. Judge Zhang first asked Gan Zhaoting about the purpose of his lawsuit. Gan replied, "The defendants defrauded me of 1,350 yuan. Initially, a friend, Cao Mingqi, introduced me to the two defendants, Xiong and Hu, who said I could get a job at the Intelligence Bureau. They asked me to pay a deposit of 1,500 yuan and appointed me as the team leader of the Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi five-county district. I paid a total of 1,380 yuan in three installments. On September 15th, I finally received an appointment letter from Li Weiqing. On September 22nd, I went to Nantong to set up an office. Unexpectedly, less than three days later, on September 25th, the defendant Li Weiqing suddenly published a notice in the Minbao newspaper stating that the Intelligence Bureau had been ordered to close and await reorganization. After seeing the news in Nantong on the 26th, I rushed to Shanghai that evening to negotiate with the defendants. Li claimed that the word 'close' only referred to the Shanghai part and had nothing to do with Nantong. At the same time, Xiong handed me an order and instructed me to intensify my work." The judge asked Li Weiqing when the Intelligence Bureau was established. Li replied, "Around August of last year." The judge asked, "When did it close?" Li replied, "September 25th." The judge asked, "At that time, did you receive an order from the Ministry of Finance to close or reorganize?" Li replied, "I did not receive an order; I requested the closure myself." The judge asked, "Since you requested it yourself, you must have received an approval document." Li replied, "I don't have an approval document." The judge asked, "Without an order or an approval document, you acted on your own initiative? You are employed in a formal government agency, why are you so confused?" The judge ordered Li to provide a reliable guarantor who could be summoned at any time and instructed him to submit all closing orders and opening orders from the Ministry of Finance to the court for verification at the next hearing.

### Truck Collision Causes Disaster; Three Fishmongers Killed and Four Injured

Two Trucks Collide at a Turn, Seven Fishmongers Bear the Brunt

At around 5:00 AM yesterday, a No. 1692 licensed truck from Fuju Truck Company, No. 249 Jielu Road, Yangshupu Dinghai Island Fish Market, loaded with dozens of baskets of fresh fish and thirteen fishmongers, was driven by Zhang Genfu from Jiading, heading south on Yangshupu Road. At the same time, a truck with license No. 6499 from Su Hengmao Truck Company was also returning along the same road. As they approached the intersection of Songpan Road and Guangxin Road, the driver of the Su Hengmao truck, Wu Shaoyuan from Nanjing, became impatient and overtook the truck. However, as he reached the corner, he could not stop in time to avoid a collision. The two trucks collided at the turn. Due to the weight of the load, the Fuju truck did not suffer extensive damage, but the railing was broken. Among the thirteen fishmongers on the truck, seven who were at the front bore the brunt of the impact, suffering severe injuries and fatalities. After being informed, the nearby police officers immediately notified the police station to dispatch ambulances to transport the injured to the hospital for treatment. However, Xu Ayu, a 50-year-old from Ningbo, Wu Rongjin, a 17-year-old from Jiangyin, and Ka Laoan, a 52-year-old from Jiangyin, died from their critical injuries. Their bodies have been sent to the coroner's office for examination. Kong Qingyuan, a 46-year-old from Ningbo, was also seriously injured and is currently hospitalized. The other three, Qiu Genfa, 32, Chen Anqing, 11, both from Ningbo, and Dai Chongqing, 22, from Suzhou, sustained minor injuries and are not in serious condition. The driver responsible for the accident has been taken back to the police station for investigation.

### Three Die After Eating Turtle

Zhao Xingsheng, 63, a coolie from Pudong, Xu Atian, 35, and a small tailor (unidentified, around 40 years old) who lived at No. 72, Li Mei Road, French Concession, made their living by scavenging and rummaging through trash cans. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, at around 5:00 PM, the three of them went to the Yiheguan small restaurant at No. 136, Huageo Road, for dinner and ate cooked turtle, which led to poisoning. The small tailor died from the poisoning at his residence on the afternoon of the 21st, at around 4:00 PM. His death was reported to the French police by his landlady, Wu Zhu, who had the body transported to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall for an autopsy. On the morning of the 22nd, at around 10:00 AM, Zhao and Xu, at their residence, also suffered severe abdominal pain due to the poisoning. They were sent to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital across from the Great World for treatment, but the treatment was ineffective. The two died successively at 1:40 PM that afternoon. The hospital reported the deaths to the French police, who had the bodies sent to the coroner's office and summoned Yao Jingzhi, the owner of the Yiheguan restaurant, for questioning. The matter has been reported to the Second Special District Court for officials to inspect the bodies today. It is also reported that the deceased were addicted to morphine, and it is suspected that the turtle reacted with the drugs, causing the deaths.

### Public Works Department Addresses the Issue of Maids

May Adopt a Registration System

In 1930, a Public Works Department police lawyer submitted a report detailing the Chinese custom of keeping maids and its origin. It also covered sections related to the practice of keeping maids within Chinese Criminal Law (crime against freedom). The Public Works Department has been paying close attention to this issue recently. The first planned step is to assign Miss M. Hinder, head of the Public Works Department Factory Affairs Office, to find ways to protect maids. Miss Hinder is a well-studied expert in factory issues and is familiar with apprentice and child labor conditions. She will attempt to ensure that needy maids receive protection and will collect relevant messages and data for the Public Works Department, allowing it to determine the appropriate steps to take, such as implementing registration or other methods. If violations of freedom are discovered, the Public Works Department may prosecute the case under Section 196 of Chinese Criminal Law.

### Female Workers at the Public Welfare Factory Expected to Return to Work Today

Party and Government Mediation Agree on a Solution

At the British-owned Public Welfare Cotton Mill, No. 150 Route de Loubert, the workers in the coarse and fine yarn sections went on strike in protest of the dismissal of the workers in the bobbin section by the enemy. The party and government agencies dispatched personnel to mediate, and a resolution has been reached regarding the dismissal of male workers and water supply. However, on the female worker side, the factory hiring of a new foreman, Qin Defang, has raised fears of replacing the original foreman, so only a little over one hundred people returned to the factory yesterday. Most workers continued to strike. After receiving the report, the party and government agencies dispatched Li Weixiong from the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Committee, Yu Yueqiu from the Investigation Section, Zhang Chuqiang from the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Xuefan from the Federation of Trade Unions, and Yao Guangchuan, the head of the Ximen Branch of the Police Bureau, to the factory yesterday afternoon to mediate. The opinions of both parties were very close, and a solution has been drafted. The solution was immediately relayed to the factory management and they were urged to resume work. The factory management also agreed to the solution, so workers are expected to return to work as usual today.

### Social Affairs Bureau Mediates the Hengfeng Silk Factory Dispute Yesterday

If there is no result, the government will mediate according to law.

### Cai Yuanxing Sues Wang Yunfu and Others for Returning Estate Under Guardianship

The Result of the Trial is that the Defendants are Not Guilty

When Cai Qin Fu, a shareholder of Ruilong Company in Ningbo, died of illness, his son Yuanxing was still a young child, and his wife was ignorant. Therefore, his estate was entrusted to his sworn brother Wang Yunfu from Zhejiang, who resides at No. 19, Lane 660, Seymour Road, for safekeeping. Not long after, Cai's wife, Wang, also died. Yuanxing became an orphan. Now that he has come of age, he has begun investigating the amount of the estate. After investigation, the amount that is under Wang's custody and can be verified is twelve shares of China Bank stock, each with a value of 100 yuan, and 1,174 yuan deposited in the bank. Last month, Yuanxing asked Wang for the estate. Wang said that Yuanxing was young and needed a certificate from a senior member of the Cai family before he would hand it over. Yuanxing then asked his uncle Cai Tongqiu and his maternal uncle Wang Mingsan to send a letter to Wang in their joint names to serve as proof. However, after receiving the letter, Wang requested that Yuanxing invite Cai and Wang to come to the venue for handover. However, Cai and Wang never went with him, resulting in an indefinite postponement. Yuanxing therefore determined that the three had the intention of jointly misappropriating the estate under guardianship. He hired lawyer Tao Wuzhi to file a criminal lawsuit of breach of trust and embezzlement against Wang, Cai, and Wang in the First Special District Court, and also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that the court order them to return the estate under guardianship. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao opened the court to summon the plaintiff and defendants for interrogation. First, the plaintiff Cai Yuanxing explained the process. When questioned, Wang Yunfu admitted the facts but said that he would hand over the estate if the plaintiff could come with Cai and Wang. However, the two defendants, Cai and Wang, said that the estate was designated for a specific purpose by the deceased at the time of his death, and they were afraid that the plaintiff would use it for other purposes, so they were unwilling to go with him. After a debate by the lawyers on both sides, the court immediately announced the verdict: the defendants are not guilty, and the attached civil lawsuit is dismissed.

### Water Levels Rise; Yangtze River Night Navigation Ban Lifted

Shanghai-Hankou Water Levels Return to Normal; Sunken Lao Shu Tong Wheel Does Not Affect Navigation

Due to scarce rainfall last year, the Yangtze River water level receded rapidly, causing the low-water season to arrive especially early, making navigation difficult. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the entire Yangtze River line is now clear and has returned to its normal water level. Details are as follows:

Yangtze River Gradually Returns to Normal Water Level

According to the Shanghai Customs yesterday, the draft of the Shanghai-Hankou section of the Yangtze River in the lower reaches is at least 17 feet and 8 inches, so large Yangtze River vessels can operate as usual. The water levels along the way yesterday are listed below: Hankou 7 feet 8 inches, Jiujiang 9 feet 3 inches, Anqing 8 feet 8 inches, Wuhu 6 feet 3 inches, Zhenjiang 6 feet 9 inches. It is now the spring flood season, so the river water is expected to increase further.

Sunken Shu Tong Wheel Does Not Obstruct Waterway

Yichang in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River also has a water level of 1 foot and 2 inches yesterday, and shallow water vessels can also travel smoothly. However, the Shu Tong Company's tugboat, which sank near Xintan upstream of Yichang, obstructed the waterway. The Jianghai Customs has received a telegram from the Yichang Customs Commissioner stating that Jiang vessels can pass safely through the sunken ship area. The telegram states that after the Shu Tong tugboat sank at Xintan on January 18th, the Minzhi vessel passed safely through the area. Merchants are instructed to be careful when traveling near the sunken ship.

Pay Attention to Navigation in the Upstream Chai Pan Channel

In the Chai Panzi Channel in the Chongqing section of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Dalaiyu vessel sank in 1926. The sunken ship has not been removed or destroyed. The Jianghai Customs recently received a notice from the Jiang Wu Director of the Chongqing Customs that the sunken ship was 2 feet above the water surface. Due to accumulated sand and the receding water depth, the sunken ship is now 2 feet above the water surface. Upstream vessels should pay close attention.

Shanghai-Hankou Night Navigation Ban Lifted at Any Time

Due to the especially low-water season, the customs office has banned night navigation for upstream and downstream vessels at the Huoyanshan Honggaopo waterway under the jurisdiction of the Jiujiang Customs in the Shanghai-Hankou section of the Yangtze River. Due to the daily rise in river water, night navigation is now permitted for upstream vessels, while downstream vessels are still restricted to daytime navigation. The bans on other waterways will be lifted at any time depending on the river water situation.

### Sun Shaoqing Arrested for Controlling Lawsuits

First Accused by Others, Then Prosecuted by the Police Department

Sun Claims That His Cousin Extorted Money and Made False Accusations

Sun Shaoqing, a 46-year-old from Tongzhou, resides at No. 28, Huayan Lane, No. 56, Zhangjia Garden, Route des Soeurs. He used to be a detective in the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. After leaving the police force, he worked as a contractor at the Waibaidu Bridge wharf. Recently, Jiang Zhaozhou (also known as Jiang Shu), a native of Anhui who resides at No. 4, Hongxi Lane, Avenue Haig, filed a lawsuit against Sun in the First Special District Court of Shanghai, accusing Sun of controlling lawsuits.

Fraud and Breach of Trust: The facts are that Jiang and Sun jointly established the Shuguang Law Firm at No. 8, Lane 60, Weihaiwei Road, to handle litigation. The cases handled included Sun Wu's lawsuit against Wu Dengyun for division of property and Jiang Guopei's lawsuit against Jiang Yang for division of property. Both cases were resolved through mediation, resulting in a large amount of money. However, Sun only gave Jiang a small amount of money, and Sun embezzled the rest. Therefore, Jiang filed a lawsuit requesting that Sun be punished according to Articles 157, Section 2, 154, Section 1, and 340 of the Criminal Law. Because this type of case cannot be privately prosecuted, the Public Works Department Legal Department learned of the case and instructed the Chief Inspector's Office of the Patrol Department to investigate. Under the investigation of Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui, it was determined that Jiang and Sun were acting together. Therefore, they requested that the First Special Court issue Arrest Warrant No. 1295 against Jiang and Sun and issued a search warrant to search No. 8, Lane 60, Weihaiwei Road. Lu and Liu arrested Sun the day before yesterday and found that Jiang was not in Shanghai, so they did not arrest him. When they went to Weihaiwei Road, they found that Lane 60 had been rebuilt, so they could not carry out the search. Yesterday morning, Sun was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District, where Judge Qian Hongye presided over the interrogation. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process and said that a litigation paper of Ma Hongkui was found in Sun's house. Because the case requires investigation, he requested a postponement. After the West Detective Inspector reported the arrest, he questioned Sun Shaoqing. Sun said that he knew Jiang Zhaozhou well and that they had recently partnered to open the Dahua Brewery. There was no such thing as jointly establishing the Shuguang Law Firm. The cause of this case was not that Jiang wanted to sue Sun, but that Sun's cousin Fang Nianxuan falsely accused him. Because Fang had previously been poor and lived in Sun's house, he was driven out for immoral behavior. Fang then organized gangs to threaten Sun, initially asking for 5,000 yuan, and then increasing the amount to 100,000 yuan. Because Sun did not agree and reported the case to the Chengdu Road Police Station, Fang made false accusations. Judge Qian reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be postponed to next Tuesday morning for further questioning.

### Shanghai South Exchange Industry Held a Representative Meeting Yesterday

Established Small Groups to Seek Self-Rectification

Investigated Capital and Re-Filed Reports

The Shanghai Exchange Industry Association Shanghai South Office, in order to relieve members, maintain business, prepare to report income tax methods, and exchange one-cent new copper auxiliary coins, convened a representative meeting at 12:00 noon yesterday. More than 30 people attended, chaired by Chen Zhongxian. Discussed items: (1) Yang Keqin proposed that the market has been declining recently, and the industry has not sought relief, but has been sacrificing itself with price cuts. At the end of the lunar year, exchange market prices were extremely chaotic, which outsiders considered manipulative. However, as a result, many businesses closed. If the association does not urgently seek relief measures, the future of the industry is of deep concern. He suggested that each road actively prepare a small group, with ten households as a group, and elect one person from each group to be responsible for guiding members to abide by commercial ethics and industry regulations, and to maintain business development and the industry's reputation. The meeting decided to convene a scheduled meeting to decide on the method, which will be organized by the Executive Committee. (2) Zhang Songji reported that members have been coming to the office to inquire about the income tax laws and regulations. It is unknown to them. The reporting deadline is approaching. If the association does not prepare for it, members will be affected in the future, and it will be difficult to shirk responsibility. He should follow the matter previously reported to the Association, but has not received a response. The meeting decided to send collectors Mei Dingxuan and Yang Xiazheng to first verify the member capital and report to the Association for filing. The tax law details and bookkeeping procedures will be notified to members after the Association verifies them, so as to avoid complicated procedures. (3) Ye Yasheng proposed that the Central Bank has entrusted the Association to entrust the allied industry to exchange new copper auxiliary coins, designating 100 companies per day, totaling 10,000 yuan, with 1,000 yuan to be distributed to the South City and French Concession offices. It is difficult to distribute equally among the households, and the allied industry has not completely received it. There is also a transfer. Now the two districts of South City and the French Concession are not enough to allocate. The Association should change its methods to make the exchange more widespread and avoid misunderstandings and disputes among members. There is no problem if there is no manipulation in the exchange of old copper coins for new coins. The meeting decided to retain the current method, and discuss it again when the market turns around. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.

### Abortion Leading to Death: Female Doctor Sentenced

Dáshēng Hospital Director Yán Pǐnzhēng Imprisoned for Three Years and Two Months

Nurse Gù Shǎoqín Also Sentenced to Ten Months Imprisonment

Lǐ Jìngzhēn, a 25-year-old woman from Shanghai and the stepmother of Lǐ Wénguì, a Shàoxīng native who has been doing business in Tiānjīn and resides at No. 97, Yǒngyù Lane, Bèilè Road, French Concession, had an affair with Shěn Fúshēng, resulting in a four-month pregnancy. Fearing the shame of childbirth, she decided to have an abortion. On the 4th of this month at 8 PM, introduced by her friend Xuē Kèbīn, she entered Dáshēng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital at No. 200, Sàbō Sài Road. There, Yán Pǐnzhēng, the hospital director and chief physician, a woman from Chóngmíng, along with intern nurse Gù Shǎoqín and Xuē Kèbīn, performed the abortion. Due to surgical incompetence, her uterus and birth canal were injured, causing unstoppable bleeding, leading to her death the following morning. The deceased's maid, Chǔ Zhāngshì, reported it to the French police, who detained Yán Pǐnzhēng, Gù Shǎoqín, and Xuē Kèbīn, seizing the abortion instruments. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. After confirmation by the Special No. 2 Court, Yán, Gù, and Xuē were handed over to the court. The police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution according to the law. The victim's husband, Lǐ Wénguì, also hired a lawyer to file a supplementary private lawsuit, seeking compensation for losses and the recovery of a diamond ring worth 12,035 yuan that had been swallowed by the hospital. After questioning by Judge Chén Shuòyīng, the defendants each hired lawyers to defend themselves. The announcement of the conclusion of the debate and the awaiting of sentencing had been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday morning, the sentencing was announced. Judge Chén arrived at the First Criminal Court and sentenced Yán Pǐnzhēng to three years and two months imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan for intentionally profiting from abortion leading to death.

### Pawnbroking Industry: New and Old Colleagues Hold Annual Membership Meeting Today

Discussing Deposit Earnings

The Pawnbroking Trade Association of this city, due to the pawnbroking businesses of its new and old members in the Chinese Concession, at the beginning of their establishment, when there were no banks or money houses in Shanghai, most surplus funds were deposited in pawnshops, making them financial institutions that activated the market. Later, with social evolution, banks and money houses were gradually established, and most deposits were transferred to banks and money houses. As of now, the surplus deposits in pawnshops are very small. Now, the Ministry of Finance authorities, because the deadline for tax declaration for various industries is approaching, instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to distribute notices, instructing compliance. After receiving the income tax declaration order, the association convened a full executive committee meeting to actively discuss and study various important issues. However, because this matter is significant and greatly affects the business of the industry, it is specifically scheduled for noon today, at the association's premises in Wújiā Lane, Nánshì, to hold an annual meeting of all new and old members. In addition to reporting on the association's affairs and accounts for the past year, they will also discuss the handling of income tax withholding on deposits in pawnshops, as well as how to declare the income tax on the pawnshops' own profits. A year-end banquet will be held afterwards for networking.

### Jealousy Among Dance Halls: A Shanghai Dance Hall Robbery

Dance Hostesses Transfer from the Juélù to Shanghai

Zhū Xiánshēng Leads a Crowd to Make Trouble

The Shanghai Dance Hall at No. 10, Lane 440, Fújiàn Road, Guǎngdōng Road intersection, just opened last Lunar New Year's Eve. Tāng Yīyǎ is the manager, and Lù Xīfēng is the assistant manager. The business is quite prosperous. Unexpectedly, last Saturday night around 9 PM, a fight broke out in the hall. The music stand, teapots, teacups, and tables and chairs were mostly destroyed, with losses estimated at over one hundred yuan. Later, the police investigation revealed the cause of the incident. Two dance hostesses, Xià Wéiyīng and Zhào Yànyàn, originally danced at the Juélù Dance Hall on Yúqiàqīng Road. However, since the opening of the Shanghai Dance Hall, these two dance hostesses transferred to Shanghai and have been doing well. Therefore, it caused jealousy from the Juélù Dance Hall. Around 9 PM on the 20th of this month, Zhū Xiánshēng, the owner of the Juélù Dance Hall, led the hall's bodyguards, Mǐn Xīnyáng from Tiānjīn, Fáng Sōngtāo, inspectors Zhāng Lìlún and Wáng Tíngshēng, and more than twenty others to make trouble at the Shanghai Dance Hall. They first occupied several tables, then bought dance tickets, forcibly wanting Xià and Zhào to go out with them. However, at that time, dance hostesses Xià and Zhào happened to have dance guests Lǐ Yùlín and Wáng Chāo invite them to sit at their table. According to dance hall regulations, when a dance hostess has a guest sitting at her table, other guests cannot buy tickets to take her out. Therefore, the Shanghai Dance Hall manager refused. Unexpectedly, this angered the group, who started clamoring. They first smashed the tabletop with teacups, then threw chairs at the music stand, damaging the instruments. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the group dispersed. Manager Tāng reported it to the Lǎozhá Police Station, who dispatched Western Inspector Smith, Chinese Detective Wáng Shànqīng, and Hé Rénruì to investigate at Juélù. When bodyguard Mǐn Xīnyáng saw the detectives arrive, he fled north out the door and was caught after being chased. A nine-section steel whip was found on him. They then entered the dance hall and arrested inspector Zhāng Lìlún. The other three perpetrators, Zhū Xiánshēng and others, had escaped. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiǎng Bǎolián filed charges according to Article 150 of the Criminal Law for disrupting order and Article 354 for property damage, and presented the above situation, requesting a postponement because the main perpetrator was at large. He also stated that dance guests Lǐ Yùlín and Wáng Chāo were also injured and had sought treatment at the Rénjì Hospital afterward. Furthermore, according to the complaint filed by Tāng Yīyǎ, the manager of the Shanghai Dance Hall, and the supplementary civil lawsuit, when questioned, the two defendants, Mǐn and Zhāng, gave evasive testimonies and also hired lawyers to appear in court, requesting bail. Judge Dài ordered the two defendants to be detained and a new hearing scheduled for Wednesday morning this week.

### Shanghai Shallow-Water Post Office Maintains Sìchuān-Guìzhōu Postal Service

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 139: Received an order from the Postal General Administration of the Ministry of Communications stating that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have low water levels, and ships are scarce, making it extremely difficult to transport mail and parcels to and from Sìchuān and Guìzhōu provinces. In order to maintain postal services during the shallow water period, the Húnán Administration has organized the Xiāng-Guì Automobile Route to reroute light mail and parcels to and from various provinces and Guìzhōu province, as well as Guìzhōu parcels, registered items, printed matter, etc., that were previously transited through Sìchuān, via Chángshā. Mail to and from Sìchuān province will still be temporarily transported by ship. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge. Director Zhà Pèilín, February 20.

### Commemorative Stamps Can Be Exchanged Until the End of the Year

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1391: Received a notice from the Postal General Administration of the Ministry of Communications stating that the sale of the commemorative stamps for the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the postal service was originally scheduled to cease on April 1, 1937. Within three months after the cessation of sales (i.e., from April 1, 1937, to June 30, 1937), they could still be used to pay for postage. From July 1, 1937, they would be invalidated and not allowed for use. However, the public holding these stamps would still be allowed to exchange them for ordinary stamps of the same value at post offices within three months after the invalidation (i.e., from July 1, 1937, to September 30, 1937). This has already been ordered to be announced. Now, because the Postal Law has been implemented, according to the provisions of the law, the exchange period after invalidation should be limited to six months, i.e., from July 1, 1937, to December 31, 1937. No further exchanges will be allowed after the deadline. This is hereby announced for public knowledge. Director Zhà Pèilín, February 17.

On the Chángshā route, the fees have already been reduced by 50%. Now it is planned to reduce them by another 20%, leaving 30% to be collected. Because the river water has risen significantly, various companies have dispatched ocean-going ships to transport large quantities of rice from Jiǔjiāng to Guǎngdōng. The state-run China Merchants Bureau's Dàshùnkāng steamer sailed to Jiǔjiāng this time and loaded a full ship of rice from Gàn Province for transport to Guǎngdōng. Yesterday morning, the ship reached Dàjiābà, about 13 nautical miles below Tàizǐjī and above Dàtōng. At that location, the deepest draft of the river surface was 17 feet, while the Dàshùnkāng, fully loaded with rice, had a draft of 18 feet and 4 inches. Also, because there was heavy fog on the river surface, it ran aground. The hull was deeply embedded in the shallow beach and could not be moved. The shipowner immediately sent a telegram requesting rescue. The Shanghai Bureau received the telegram and, as there were no ships available for dispatch from Shanghai at that time, decided to send a telegram to the Jiānghuá steamer, which was coming from Hàn to Shanghai, to quickly go to Dàjiābà and find a way to rescue the Dàshùnkāng. If they can tow the Dàshùnkāng out during the rising water, that would be best. If they still cannot tow it, they will hire barges and the No. 1 tugboat to unload the cargo and then tow it away.

### Shanghai-Fújiàn Freight Rates Increase by 20%

Effective from Next Month 1st

Last year, shipping on the northern and southern ocean routes and the Yangtze River routes was very developed, and the water freight rates at coastal ports and on the Yangtze River have repeatedly increased. Only the Shanghai-Fúzhōu route has remained at the old price. When the freight rates on various routes increased last year, this route had not increased. Recently, due to the fact that the cost of metal, coal, materials, and other items used for ships has been extremely high, some being more than double the previous cost, the China Merchants, Three Northern, Tàigǔ, and Rìqīng shipping companies held a joint meeting yesterday and decided that, starting from the 1st of next month, the cargo shipped from Shanghai to Fúzhōu will uniformly increase by 20% of the original freight rate. This will be announced to the customers today.

The long-awaited Bǎikèmén All-Star Gala, renowned for its eighty performers and forty beauties, has stirred the local people with its great fame, who have been eagerly anticipating it. It is now scheduled to debut at the Cǎěrdūn Theatre starting the day after tomorrow (the 25th of this month). The theatre is strict in its selection of song and dance troupes. Years ago, when the Wànhuā Troupe came to Shanghai, it performed at the theatre and caused a sensation, with crowds of people thronging the streets. It is said that the reputation of the Bǎikèmén All-Star Gala in Europe and the United States is no less than that of the past Wànhuā Troupe.

Now the entire troupe is coming to Shanghai for the first time, appearing before the people of Shanghai in a completely new form. It is expected to be a grand occasion.

### Unity and Peace (Continued)

— Pān Gōngzhǎn

(4)

Perhaps some people will ask again: seeking peace through unity is correct, but to achieve unity, it is necessary to eliminate separatist forces. If separatist forces are unwilling to be eliminated, war is inevitable. If the initial goal is unity for peace, and the subsequent action is war for unity, isn't this a contradiction? Therefore, I will further explain the relationship between unity and war.

There is no doubt that unity requires the elimination of separatist forces. What methods should be used to eliminate them? It should be understood that war is not always necessary, nor is it always unnecessary. When war is needed, then war; when war is not needed, then peace. Therefore, seeking peace requires unity, and this is certain. However, seeking unity does not necessarily mean relying solely on peace or solely on war. The first "peace" is the goal, and the second "peace" is the method. In other words, we can use peaceful methods to eliminate separatist forces, achieve unity, and reach the goal of peace; we can also use war to eliminate separatist forces, achieve unity, and reach the goal of peace.

There are many examples in Chinese and foreign history of using war to eliminate separatist forces. There are countless examples. As for examples of eliminating separatist forces through peaceful means, there are also some. After Emperor Tàizǔ of Sòng, Zhào Kuàngyìn, became emperor, he saw that the meritorious military generals inevitably became arrogant, and he was deeply afraid that they would become too powerful to control, forming a separatist situation. Therefore, he hosted a banquet for the meritorious officials and persuaded them to hand over their military power. This is a famous story in history called "Releasing Military Power with a Cup of Wine." That is an example of using peaceful means to eliminate separatist forces. As for how the warlord separatist forces gradually disappeared after the establishment of the Republic of China? I can say that the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1926 was to suppress what? It was to suppress the warlords. First, Wu Peifu; second, Sun Chuanfang; third, Zhang Zuolin. If the Northern Expedition had not been launched at that time, how would these warlord separatist forces have been eliminated? Therefore, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was to seek unity through war and to seek peace through unity. This kind of use of war to seek unity is sometimes necessary, but it is not necessarily the only method. Mencius once said, "King Wen's one anger pacified the people of the world, ...King Wu's one anger also pacified the people of the world." He also said, "Tang's one campaign, starting with Ge, the world believed in him. Invading the western barbarians while facing the east, the eastern people complained; invading the northern barbarians while facing the south, the southern people complained." Even saints like Tang and Wu could not avoid using war to unify China. Needless to say, how much war was used to create a unified situation in the dynasties after Qin Shi Huang. Yet now, a few biased people call seeking unity through war "military unification," as if it were absolutely evil, forgetting history and ignoring reality. In all fairness, if the Northern Expedition had not been launched in 1926, how could the warlord separatist forces have been eliminated? Therefore, when it is necessary, and when all peaceful methods have failed to achieve unity, one must use force to quell rebellion, punish traitors, and punish those who undermine unity; otherwise, what is the use of military force? There are only two ways to achieve unity, past and present, at home and abroad: peace and war. Use peace when you should use peace; use war when you should use war. Mencius, who always advocated "subduing people with virtue," even said to King Xuan of Qi, "Now if the king is angry, the people of the world will only fear that the king does not like bravery." He also said, "Now Yan abuses its people, and if the king goes to conquer it, the people will think that he is rescuing them from fire and water, and they will bring baskets of food and pots of drink to welcome the king's army." It can be seen that war is not necessarily something that should only be cursed.

### Cotton Yarn

Indian Merchants Prepare to Receive Goods

Yarn Prices Rise by 2.5 Yuan This Month

Sellers Vigorously Deliver Goods

Yarn in Warehouses Exceeds 30,000 Bales

Large Volume of Forward Contracts Sold Off

The downward trend in forward yarn contracts is becoming increasingly intense, and the situation is weak. This is due to the abundance of delivery commodities causing prices to fall. However, the February contract is the final act, and many parties are prepared to receive all deliveries, so the February contract alone rose by 2.5 yuan. However, prices for later months have greatly loosened. According to market sources, the goods received by buyers are being heavily sold off in the forward market to avoid risks. Afternoon reports indicate that deliveries to warehouses have exceeded 30,000 bales, reaching 33,000 bales. Among these, 1,750 bales have already been withdrawn from delivery because the closing price was one yuan lower. Therefore, although this month is being kept tight, sellers are very active in the forward market, and the market is tending to fall. However, spot yarn sales have not declined. The closing price of standard yarn for the February contract was 257 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan compared to last month, it is said.

Significant Price Fluctuations Between Spot and Forward Standard Yarn

At the opening of the standard yarn market, the current month was the last day of trading, and the competition between buyers and sellers became more intense. Although sellers vigorously delivered goods, Indian merchants were prepared to accept a large volume, so the price for this month still rose by 2 yuan. However, the atmosphere for later months was peaceful. At the second trading session, the price for this month rose another yuan, while the price for later months declined instead. Most traders were neutral, because the yarn delivered to warehouses was already close to 30,000 bales, so they were unanimously selling off the forward contracts, putting heavy pressure on the market. However, spot yarn trading was still good, and Osaka's Three Products Yarn also rebounded 2.7 to 3.2 yuan. The final prices of standard yarn for each month fell by 0.9 to 1.34 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, but the price for this month rose by 2.5 yuan. The market transactions were very active, and trading closed at around 12:30 PM. At the afternoon opening, the market situation for this month was still high, rising another 0.5 yuan, but many buyers sold off their forward contracts, causing the price to fall. After the second session, the price for this month fell 0.5 yuan, and the price for later months gradually declined. The yarn delivered to warehouses had reached over 32,000 bales. Compared with the morning closing price, the result for standard yarn was that the February contract remained unchanged, while the price for later months fell another 0.8 to 1.5 yuan. Sales included Dafu (2,500 bales), Tongji (2,300 bales), Jinchang (2,900 bales), Gengfeng (1,250 bales), Dachangcheng (1,000 bales), Changfeng (1,900 bales), Fukang (2,100 bales), Mingde (2,850 bales), Yuan Yi (1,200 bales), Run Kang (2,850 bales), and Xincheng (800 bales). Purchases included Hexing (1,300 bales), Dafeng (1,350 bales), Juxing (900 bales), Yuda (1,700 bales), Zhenda (1,550 bales), Daqing (1,050 bales), Changyu (1,200 bales), Renfeng (1,400 bales), Chunchang (1,600 bales), Senkang (3,000 bales), Juncheng (1,050 bales), Shengyuan (1,000 bales), Hengde (900 bales), Jifeng (800 bales), and Shenji (900 bales). The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Yarn Sales Still Exceed 2,000 Bales

Spot yarn sales are still good. A statistical check of all the groups buying throughout the day totals 2,193 bales. The selling price is similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each group is listed below.

Large Batch of New Contracts Delivered

Many Cotton Futures Positions Liquidated

Month-End Price Falls to 42.6 Yuan

The cotton market is weakening, and the downward trend is particularly strong. This is due to the decline in the yarn market, the sluggish overseas cotton market, and the fact that there are still 45,000 dan of new contracts for delivery this month. After inspection, they are up to standard, and the factories have no need to receive goods, so people are particularly frustrated. The market continues to decline, and the price for this month breaks through the 3 yuan mark. The end-of-month price is 42.6 yuan.

Each Month Falls by More Than Half a Yuan

At the opening of the standard cotton market, prices for each month declined generally, and the market trend was exceptionally weak. Because the delivery volume for the current month is abundant, and the new contracts of cotton that have passed the inspection at the cotton inspection office have reached 45,000 dan, sellers are increasingly active. As a result, the final prices of standard cotton for each month fell by 0.3 to 0.45 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, the market situation remained unfavorable, and there were many floating positions being liquidated in the market. With an oversupply of contracts, the downward trend for later months was particularly intense. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales included Yuda (9,000 dan), Tongfu (1,800 dan), Jifeng (2,300 dan), Hengyi (6,900 dan), Zhenda (2,400 dan), Fengchun (2,400 dan), Wang Taixing (3,500 dan), Yuan Yi (5,000 dan), Fukang (5,000 dan), Jinghua (2,300 dan), Yongda (3,300 dan), Xincheng (3,800 dan), Changhe (4,200 dan), Yuanxingchang (1,700 dan), and Senkang (1,800 dan). Purchases included Dafu (1,300 dan), Tongji (4,400 dan), Juxing (2,500 dan), Dafeng (6,200 dan), Taixing (4,100 dan), Shenchang (2,800 dan), Run Kang (6,900 dan), Shengyuan (5,700 dan), Tonghe (5,800 dan), Yichang (2,800 dan), and Daji (2,000 dan). The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Spot Cotton Consumption is Mediocre

Factories have poor demand, and there are no new sources reported.

Small Increase in Prices for Three Products Yarn and Cotton

Osaka telegram on the 22nd: Spot yarn prices rise and fall by 4 to 8 yuan. 16-count "Fan" yarn is 232 yuan, up 4 yuan. 20-count "Goldfish" yarn is 253 yuan, up 5 yuan. 40-count "Five Stars" yarn is 390 yuan, down 5 yuan. 42-count "Pheasant" yarn is 378 yuan, up 8 yuan. Three Products futures yarn rises 0.15 to 0.4 yuan. The near month is 243.9 yuan, and the far month is 245.5 yuan. Futures cotton rises 0.3 to 0.75 yuan. The near month is 73.8 yuan, and the far month is 75.25 yuan.

### Securities

Class B Bonds Decline the Fastest

Long Positions Retreat After Four Small Trading Sessions

Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange held the last two days of futures trading for this month. The market has resumed four full trading sessions each day. Both buyers and sellers are actively settling and swapping contracts. Since Nos. 45 and 46 sold short on Class A bonds, the market atmosphere has been depressed. Long positions for this month are most concentrated in Class B bonds, due to speculation related to the lottery red tickets. Therefore, in the last day or two, long positions have been unwinding, and the decline in Class B bonds has been the fastest. The market price declined over four small sessions, creating a short squeeze. Today is the last day of trading for the February futures. Although there may still be some squeezing, there should not be any significant changes. However, abnormal situations are unavoidable. Yesterday, at the opening in the morning, Nos. 3, 16, and 11 bought in, raising the leading prices by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, while lowering the trailing prices by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Because Nos. 5, 45, and 46 were still selling, the trend changed, and the second session immediately became depressed, trending downwards consistently, mostly falling by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. At the afternoon opening, long positions continued to swap, with No. 6 being the most active. All bonds fell again by 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. Although retail investors absorbed some at the closing, large long positions were still unwinding. The price of Class B bonds for this month dropped sharply again by 0.45 yuan. Only the far-term Class A bonds recovered by 0.05 yuan. The overall result was a consistent downward trend, with declines ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 11,122,500 yuan. The results of the price fluctuations are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

Although Meifu closed, the situation was still loose. Fortunately, Chinese firms mediated, so the overall situation was still peaceful. Later in the market, Little Luzon sold a small amount of US dollars. The banks' appetite was depressed, and the situation remained hard. Midway, the banks slightly offset, and the market stabilized.

### Piece Goods

Spot Sales from All Routes Gradually Increase

Prices for Current Goods are All Firm

Yesterday, the fabric market continued to be firm. This was due to the gradual increase in spot sales from all routes. At the same time, the fabric market in Qingdao was even better than in Shanghai, with selling prices exceeding Shanghai's by more than 0.1 yuan. As a result, fine cloth and fine twill from Qingdao were constantly absorbed by Tianjin merchants, and selling prices rose steadily. Yesterday, the price increased by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan per bolt, and Shanghai goods also increased by 0.025 yuan. Tianjin merchants traded over 500 bales. Merchants on this street were less interested, trading nearly 200 bales. Japanese merchants opened few goods. Fine cloth and fine twill from local factories were in highest demand from Wuzhou merchants, with 500 more pieces being purchased. The appetite for goods in Guangzhou and Shantou was also strong, with 400 to 500 pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, striped plain silk, serge, zigong, printed cloth, and colored cloth being traded. Merchants from Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou also showed improvement, with increased purchases. This was actually because the Nanyang market was gradually improving. In addition, spot sales in the Yangtze River basin, the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the northwest regions were also expected to develop. Therefore, although Shanghai's inventory was quite abundant, the atmosphere was still good. Prices were firm for all goods that were currently selling, and the only goods whose price fell were those that were out of season. However, the downward trend was also very moderate, it is said.

Zigong Serge Sells Particularly Well

The Trend for Domestic Goods is Even Better

Zigong felt is currently selling very well, and merchants on this street all have demand. Western goods are very short in stock, and although Eastern goods are in circulation, they are few in number. As a result, domestic goods are taking the opportunity to rise, and sales are very active. The products of the Zhanghua and Xiexin Second Factories are almost unable to meet demand. The trend is better than other woolen fabrics.

Plain serge is currently in time for spring sales. Clothing stores, cotton cloth shops, and tailoring shops all have large purchases. The trend for domestic goods is better than for Western goods. This is because in recent years, after the new uniform system was adopted, military, government, academic, and business circles have all been vigorously promoting the use of domestic goods, resulting in sales exceeding imported goods. Transactions are increasing steadily, and standard prices are particularly firm. Among them, the Zhanghua 918 and Dalong 128 brands have particularly wide sales. Yesterday, 918 yuan Tibetan plain serge sold for 3.05 yuan, and 128 sold for 3 yuan. Grass yellow and dark green were an additional 0.1 yuan.

### Grains

Flour Prices Fall and then Stabilize Due to Poor Factory Sales

Yesterday in the flour market, after opening in the morning, prices for each month showed a consistent decline. As for foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell 1.0 to 1.1 yuan, Canada fell by 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 yuan, while Liverpool only fell slightly by 0.25. After the opening prices, because of the strong downward trend in foreign wheat, people's confidence was naturally unstable. The opening price for this month fell to 4.02 to 4.03 yuan, and the prices for March and April also fell by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan. July new contracts were relatively scarce, falling only slightly by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Below the second session, factories supplemented their positions in this month, and the market stabilized. The factories' forward sales were sluggish, and outside firms slightly purchased, so the market also saw a recovery. When the afternoon market opened, the transactions for each month were relatively clear, and the market was rotating. According to speculators, if actual sales are smooth and it is difficult to get foreign wheat, then the trend is expected to be flat.

Inland Merchants Purchase Near- and Far-Term Wheat

Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed a pattern of falling first and then rising. As for foreign wheat quotations, although they fell by 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 to 1.1 yuan, the price of old wheat had not yet been agreed, and new wheat was even more difficult to agree on. Moreover, because this month has been absorbed by Tianjin merchants, the market atmosphere was relatively stable. The opening price only fell by 0.04 yuan and quickly rose by 0.04 yuan. Before March, because sellers were very few, they only fell by 0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 yuan. When the afternoon market opened, the flour market was slightly stable, and inland merchants purchased both near- and far-term wheat. Therefore, the market atmosphere was very stable, recovering by 0.03, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan. The final result was even better by 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 yuan. In the spot wheat market, because the standard price recovered and factory demand was also good, it was slightly better by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The opening price for Ocean River wheat was 6.6 yuan, the next best was 0.15 yuan less, Bengbu wheat was 6.6 yuan, Jiangbei Shaoxing Huangqiao Tiantai wheat was 6.55 yuan, and Nanjing wheat was 6.53 yuan. Fuxin handled 3,000 bags, Shenda handled 2,000 bags, and Fufeng handled 250 bags, it is said.

Guangdong Merchants Buy Machine-Hulled Rice Very Actively

Yesterday, customer indica rice and customer glutinous rice were still in high demand, especially with Guangdong merchants eagerly purchasing machine-hulled rice and late-season machine-hulled rice. In the past two days, Guangdong merchants had already purchased 50,000 bags of machine-hulled rice and machine-hulled late-season rice. In the past two days, the merchants on this street from Shantou, Xiamen, Beiyang, and Xi'an also purchased more than 20,000 bags. The market has rapidly risen, recovering by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. If Guangdong rice demand continues, the market may continue to rise in the future. Yesterday, over 40,000 bags of rice were opened, with Guangdong merchants taking two-thirds of the supply. Therefore, the sentiment was mostly excited, and although the supply from the Yangtze River was continuous, sellers still expressed intentions to raise prices, it is said.

Soybean Oilcake Aided by the Dalian Market

Yesterday, the standard soybean oilcake market remained flat in the morning due to the small fluctuations in the Dalian market. Only standard soybeans were affected by the sluggish spot sales and inventory accumulation, with the near-term declining slightly by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. In the afternoon, news of a sharp rise in the Dalian market suddenly arrived, and standard oil saw short covering and interest from outsiders, so the price rose steadily in each session, closing higher by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Standard oilcake also improved by 0.01 yuan. Although the rebound in Dalian's standard soybean market was strong, the current market was sluggish due to a lack of customer interest, and factories were also stagnant. The large number of tickets in Dalian had accumulated for a long time and lacked outlets, and there was talk of transporting them south. Therefore, sentiment was still weak. As a result, the near-term improved by 0.01 yuan, and the far-term improved by 0.03 yuan, it is said.

Tianjin Merchants Slightly Buy and Sell Thin Rice

(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was slightly more than before, with a total of 40 sources arriving, totaling about 8,100 to 8,200 shi. Thin rice accounted for more than 20 sources, but the appetite of customer merchants was still depressed. Although merchants from Tianjin and Qinhuangdao bought more than 2,000 bags of thin rice, the purchasing conditions were extremely harsh, so thin rice was still difficult to recover. Only high-quality goods barely stabilized, and mid-range goods were all discounted by a small amount. The arrival of thick japonica rice was not strong, but sales in this street were sluggish, so the market situation was still stable with a hint of softness. However, it was reported that customer premium prices suddenly rose by 0.2 yuan, and the japonica rice market inevitably had the hope of being boosted. It is expected that the market situation today may temporarily stabilize. Du Yang premium and dark mutated glutinous rice had little glory or shame.

(Shanghai North) Yesterday, about 22 or 23 sources came from the river. Sales of various goods on the market were sluggish. Top-quality white glutinous rice prices were soft, and medium-grade and low-grade ones were reduced by small amounts. Thin rice stocks were abundant, and prices fell by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan. Early rice arrivals surged, and appetite was weak, with prices falling by nearly 0.1 yuan. Sheep indica was affected by sales of Jiangxi indica, and prices fell by a straight 0.1 yuan.埠Du premium was also soft by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan, and the rest all had a soft trend. Only mutated yuan glutinous rice had acceptable sales, and prices recovered by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan.

### Sugar Market

South River Green Opens Up 0.3 Yuan

Yesterday, the trend in foreign sugar was flat. Domestic green sugar was still tight. The guild's drawing price was 22.9 yuan for spot goods of 24 rough white sugar, and 7.5 yuan for re-export, with no changes. Only 8th grade spot goods of East White were down 0.05 yuan, to 22.6 yuan, while the rest maintained their original prices. The local factory's fine white sugar also had no changes. Guangdong merchants opened up over a hundred bags of Chongti Green, at 14.4 yuan, Guangzhou merchants opened up dozens of bags of Hainan foreign sugar, at 14.2 yuan, and over two hundred bags of South River Green, at 14.3 yuan, up 0.3 yuan. In addition, there were over seventy pieces of Beihai sheet green sugar at 11 yuan, and Fujian merchants opened up over a hundred bags of Zhang Diao Green at 13.6 yuan, and dozens of bags of Quanzhou sheet green sugar at 11.6 yuan, up 0.2 yuan.

The joint venture company held its first tender for Guangdong sugar this week. The total quota was 4,725 bags, and the bid price remained the same. The tender sold 60 bags of Shunde Factory's Five Sheep rough white sugar at 22.8 yuan. Dongguan Factory sold another 160 bags at 22.8 yuan. Huizhou medium sand white was offered at 20 yuan, but there were no transactions.

### Dried Fruits and Nuts

Medium-Grade Longan Inventory Very Short

Medium-grade longan has recently lacked new arrivals, and inventory is also short, so the price increase is higher. According to Quanzhou telegrams, medium-sized longan is also said to be out of stock and sellers are reluctant to sell, indicating that there is a shortage everywhere. The market is expected to continue to rise.

### Silk and Tea

Internal and External Silk Sales Are Still Difficult to Improve

Yesterday in the overseas silk market, New York was closed for the weekend, and Yokohama showed a slight increase. Spot goods were 883 yuan, up 3 yuan, futures were 848 yuan, up 9 yuan. Lyon was unchanged. In the local silk market, manufacturers' sentiment was firm, and the prices sent abroad were also high, so there were not many transactions. As for users, silk factories have generally not yet started work, and transactions were sparse. Silk market trends have been mediocre recently, and it is still difficult to expand sales of internal and external silk for a while.

Chinese Tea Exports Do Not Require Permits

In order to promote the export of domestic products, the government has completely exempted taxes on the export of red and green tea from China. However, in order to distinguish between domestic and foreign sales, permits have always been required. Last year, Cheng Zhenji, the general manager of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee, understood the details. He believed that exported red and green tea already had different boxes and baskets from domestically sold rough tea. The merchants who held these permits faced many obstacles. Therefore, he requested the upper echelons to consult the Ministry of Finance and inform the Customs Administration to abolish them. It is said that it has been officially approved. From now on, export boxed tea will save all kinds of procedures.

### Miscellaneous Items

Large Batches of Japanese Goods Arrive Constantly

Large quantities of Japanese goods continue to be imported, as repeatedly reported in the past. Statistics show that, in addition to coal, sugar, iron sheets, and iron wire, approximately 10,000 tons of goods arrive each week, which is considerable. The trade deficit with Japan can be imagined. It has been reported that the Japanese ship Maya Maru arrived this afternoon, carrying 1,000 pieces of rayon, 4,000 bags of sugar, 3,440 cans of hardened oil (for chemical use), 7,054 pieces of iron sheets, and over 3,200 tons of hydrochloric acid, sulfur, etc.

### Hardware

Tinplate No Longer Has Futures Contracts Available

Tinplate factories in the United States are not producing enough to meet distribution demands, and Japan, the South Seas Islands, and India have restricted the issuance of near-term orders. Therefore, local merchants have no futures contracts available. As a result, the situation in Shanghai is very good. Association steel is selling for 41 yuan, 90-pound double-linked American goods are selling for 46 yuan, 100-pound double-linked goods are selling for 48 yuan, 180-pound Italian tinplate is selling for 44 yuan, 180-pound French tinplate is selling for 43 yuan, and 180-pound German goods are selling for 43.5 yuan. Yesterday, 600 to 700 boxes were opened, and merchants from Tianjin purchased them. Local factories also made some minor purchases.

### The Woolen Fabric Industry in 1936 Passed Happily (Continued)

(December) Riding breeches, broadcloth, and covert cloth all rose sharply. Black and gray colors were particularly popular. Western and Eastern goods have been exhausted, and domestic production has fallen short by one-third, resulting in a crazy rise in prices. "Sea White Dragon" was particularly popular, and almost all of the market goods have been collected, and selling prices have soared by over one yuan. Horse sleeve linings and Jiangshan horsehair sold in a timely and broad manner, but production was very short due to raw material issues, and market prices continued to soar. Polish 5-yuan bright thick overcoat wool, Yuan Chang black, white, and gray all-wool, and Western-style clothing firms need and sell rapidly, and the market goods mostly became unable to meet demand. Goods all rose by 10 percent. The trend of chic, the speed of the rise, can truly be called unprecedented and unsurpassed. Although single-sided open-water beauty does not have an actual wholesale recipient, due to weak inventory, all prices are being increased to six yuan. Since the Xi'an Incident was reported on the 13th, sellers' attitudes have suddenly hardened, and all transactions are only conducted in current national currency banknotes. Because market stocks of all goods are lacking, there is much optimism and speculation. Due to income tax reasons, the industry's year-end account closures seem more serious than in previous years, resulting in more retail transactions and fewer wholesale transactions. However, industry insiders, given the excellent market conditions, price increases, and goods shortages in 1936, are quite active in placing orders with Western and foreign firms. As a result, the year of 1936 was happily passed in a joyful atmosphere of profits. A detailed comparison of woolen fabric prices over the past year is provided below for reference.

Spring and Autumn

### Life and Death

— (Huang Weiling)

Is life happy? Is death painful? Many people explore this question, but they can't find the correct answer.

Leaving aside all theories and philosophies, the facts clearly tell us: We cannot definitively say that life is happy or painful. Similarly, we cannot definitively say that death is painful or happy.

However, this is merely a matter of timing. In reality, we can say this: When we are born when we shouldn't be, life is painful. Similarly, when we die when we should, death is happy; when we die when we shouldn't, death is painful.

If old age comes upon us, and we should die, we should die happily! If justice and responsibility compel us, and we should die, we should also happily go to our deaths! But if old age is still far away from us, we should actively seek to live, and for the sake of justice and responsibility, we should strive for a proper life.

A life lived when one should be alive is a happy one, and a death when one should die is also a happy one. We seek life to avoid an untimely death, and we embrace a proper death in pursuit of life.

Our own life and death are in our own hands!

### Fashionable Puppets

— Fang Zheng

I'm ashamed to say! After drifting in Shanghai for eight or nine years, I still haven't witnessed the most fashionable electric perm. The reason is simple: my noble place is the countryside. It's really inconvenient and uneconomical to travel to Shanghai just to get a haircut. Yesterday, I went to a certain road in the French Concession on business, and my hair was already in dire need of trimming. To avoid disfiguring my appearance, I went into a barber shop with a double-wide storefront to get it fixed. It was a coincidence! There was a woman getting an electric perm! The spectacle that had been on my mind for a long time was finally revealed to me. That large perm appliance covered her head, and strands of her natural hair were strung through each of the rubber tubes inside the appliance. Once the power was turned on, the hair immediately started to spin. It amazed me! It was a horrifying sight! I wondered, how is this different from a criminal being electrocuted? If that machine broke, there would be a risk of death in an instant! It's not worth enduring such torture for the sake of fashion. No wonder some people say, "Humans may appear to be higher animals, the spirit of all things, but in reality, they are just big fools." There's a good reason for saying that!

Because of the perm, I couldn't help but think of other living dramas of people willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of fashion: In the harsh winter, people wear cotton robes and cotton shoes and still don't feel warm, but modern girls still wear cheongsams with thin linings and silk stockings with hollow high heels! Are they made of copper and iron and not afraid of the cold? That's all for the sake of fashion. My colleague, Mr. Mu, is good at dancing. According to him, a certain dancer reduced her food intake because lipstick made it difficult for her to eat. This proves that for the sake of fashion, people will even be cautious about eating, which is the most important thing in life.

Traitors seek fame and fortune and become puppets of a certain power. People in Shanghai seek fashion and are no different from puppets of fashion!

### Random Musings on Side Jobs

— Jiao Shijie

Engaging in a side job in addition to one's proper occupation is nothing more than wanting to earn some extra money to supplement one's income, what is commonly called "making extra money."

If a woman, for example, has a proper job as a hostess, and people say that she engages in a side job, and an improper one at that, it means that she uses the name of hostess, but in reality, lives the life of a prostitute. In this case, her actual life is a reversal of the proper and the secondary, because she cannot live on her proper job, and the income from her side job is greater! So in the end, it is impossible to say which is the proper job and which is the side job.

Some people neglect their proper jobs for the sake of their side jobs, so ordinary businessmen cannot hold concurrent positions and cannot tolerate the existence of side jobs.

People with side jobs are probably always idle. People without free time have no time to engage in side jobs. Now that radio is widespread, there are many more new side jobs.

For a famous actor, recording records is another source of income in addition to performing on stage. Broadcasting on the radio is also another source of income. These are all side jobs. Writers can sell their writings, can go to the broadcasting station to teach, tell stories, those who can play the harmonica can also broadcast, those who can tell jokes, sing tunes, even dogs that bark and birds that sing can also broadcast. (There are such things in foreign countries.) As a result, many side job opportunities have been added. When many people succeed in their side jobs, surpassing their proper jobs, the side job becomes the proper job, and the concurrent job becomes the main job. Don't you see that many people are making a living by broadcasting?

Originally, only talented and ambitious people could hold concurrent positions. But now many people are doing ×× Chairman, concurrently serving as ×× President. These people with concurrent positions, rather than saying they are holding concurrent positions, it is better to directly say they are doing side jobs. In the end, the reason why they want to engage in side jobs is nothing more than wanting to earn more money!

Xuyuan New Poetry

### Shown to Cuier and Sent with a Handful of Willow Catkins on Lichun Day

— Tianxu Wosheng

This year, the stove festival was before the Great Cold,
By chance, we meet Lichun, the weather suddenly warms.
(Rising tone) My humble home, I shamefully measure the temperature,
The thermometer rises to sixty-five.
At dawn, the thrush sings,
The rising sun fills the courtyard trees.
I get up just at mao hour,
In a flash, it's already noon.
Originally, I planned with my family
To take the express train to Huangpu,
But I am troubled by frozen chilblains,
One foot cannot lift.
Although I can walk with a cane,
It is still painful.
I originally came from my hometown,
How could I say my return is blocked?
I open my pavilion by the pond,
Holding wine, I face the vegetable garden.
Pickled vegetables are being opened from the jar,
Zongzi are also being wrapped.
What a pity that my teeth are failing,
And not as good as your mother's.
Your mother is older than me,
Celebrating her sixtieth birthday.
Lichun is the beginning of the year,
Its system was created in ancient times.
Preventing old age is raising children,
Counting the classics, don't forget the ancestors.
You are one year younger,
Your youth is vigorous.
Do not learn from the old,
You should learn from children,
Laughing and talking brings spring,
Better than taking ginseng for supplement.
Crows still feed their young,
Lambs kneel to give milk.
Your brother plans to be independent,
To establish his own household.
Your younger brother is too simple,
Stammering and unable to speak.
The grandson relies on pampering,
Moving and kicking, using his force.
The weak sister cannot bear it,
If her skin is injured, she will complain.
The Queen Mother smiles,
Also gets angry.
The little maid is still foolishly cute,
Still lying lazily late in the day.
Often arguing with the cook in the kitchen,
Grumbling, starting disagreements.
I wish to be the Kitchen God,
Applying Xia Chu punishment to each one.
Reporting directly to heaven,
Do not tell me.
I am afraid of troubles,
Unwilling to be the head of the household.
Therefore, I have three burrows,
My zodiac sign is Rabbit.
Listening to it as if I didn't hear,
Seeing it as if I didn't see.
Awake, I am alone and aloof,
In dreams, I am always vivid.
Neither discussing honor or disgrace,
Nor caring about praise or criticism.
Children, do not learn from the ancients,
But learn from your father,
Everything that should be done, should be done,
Nothing that shouldn't be done can be forgiven.
Touching myself, I often smile,
Picking up the brush, I look around.
Only feeling the world is vast,
Do not let the good times be wasted.
The wind is calm, the trees are peaceful,
The parents rely on protection.
Do not look at the West Lake willows,
Early spring has already flown catkins.
Curtains rolled up, catching light gauze,
For no reason, blowing catkins.
Sent to Bu Qicha,
To ask for Xie Ting sentences.
Still fearing old eyes are blurred,
Or perhaps a mistake in recognition.
Sealed in a jade earring,
To make up for old age. (Attached Willow Catkins? One package)

### The Replaced Phoenix

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Eleven (Murmurs of Gratitude for a Compassionate Mother-in-law, Repenting and Sacrificing Filially, Autumn Light Dims, Delicate Eyebrows Trigger Reflections on the Scenery)

Menglan said, "Is she really sick? How come I can't see a trace of it?" The Second Young Mistress said, "You are clever all your life, but foolish for a moment. Think about it, someone like mother who loves you so much, would she let you know that she's sick? When you get close to her, she immediately puts on a full display of energy, smiling at you even if she doesn't feel like it, talking even if she doesn't want to. If you don't know what's on her mind, how would you know that she has a hidden illness?" Hearing her sister-in-law's report, Menglan's face immediately became more somber, and she sat up even straighter to show her attention to the matter. Then she looked at the Second Young Mistress and asked, "Does father know about this?" The Second Young Mistress said, "Maybe he knows a little bit, but mother definitely wouldn't tell father the truth, because if father knew mother was sick, he would definitely advise her to take medicine." Menglan said, "Of course, no one wants to take medicine, but good medicine tastes bitter but is beneficial to the illness, and it must be taken. Even if mother hides it, the two young mistresses can reveal a little bit to father." The Second Young Mistress nodded and said, "Girl, how come you still don't understand? Mother doesn't have some kind of cold or digestive illness. The problem is that she has many knots in her heart. If you don't untie those knots and just keep telling her to drink bitter medicine, what's the use?" Menglan said, "According to Second Sister-in-law, the situation is quite serious!" The Second Young Mistress followed the words, and also frowned, because Dao: "Serious is nothing serious, but the old man always seems to have a bad feeling in his heart. I think, if my sister persuades him, then maybe his heart will be relieved." Menglan said, "How can I persuade him?" As she said this, her face added another layer of redness. The Second Young Mistress also squinted at him, but his attitude was very calm, and he smiled slightly: "What do you not understand about this? A mother is always closer to her daughter, and if you can roll around in the old woman's arms a couple of times, then of course the old lady will be happy." A big stone in Menglan's heart just fell down. Because of Dao: "I thought you were saying that I had some magic medicine that could cure the old lady's illness, but it turned out that you were saying this. This method, no matter how embarrassed a person as big as me is to do it, even if I am embarrassed to do it, it will only make him smile temporarily. If the mother has some psychological illness, as the saying goes, psychological illness still needs psychological medicine." The Second Young Mistress smiled, and did not follow up on this. After Menglan said that, she also sat silently. A series of footsteps echoed on the stairs, and Little Ju was holding four plates in his arms with both hands. The Second Young Mistress said, "Look at what this child is doing, isn't he just looking for a scolding? How can you carry four plates upstairs at once?" (136)

### An Old Horse's Escape from Misfortune

— Special

In 1927, when the British garrison withdrew from Shanghai, there was a fine steed in the army. Having served for many years and achieved military feats, the entire army gave it the name "Old Horse" and loved it dearly. Unwilling to make it travel across the ocean again and endure the hardships of a long march, they gave it, along with several other horses, to a certain foreign corps in Shanghai, with the agreement that "under no circumstances should it be sold." They hoped that the "old soldier" could enjoy its life in peace from then on, like a warrior returning to his fields, but unexpectedly, it suffered greatly as a result. If it hadn't been rescued in time, it would have been left in a ditch to die without anyone knowing its end. Its new owner forgot the agreement, or deliberately broke his promise. At first, he used "Old Horse" for hire, and then sold it to the Longfei Auction House, earning eighty gold coins. "Old Horse" then entered the dark and lowly stables of Zhabei, serving as a common laborer. The contrast between this situation and its past glory, when it proudly galloped in the army and its owner loved it as a friend, was like heaven and earth. If "Old Horse" had known, how would it have felt? In June 1935, the Shanghai Animal Protection Society, established by foreigners, accidentally discovered "Old Horse" in the suburbs of Zhabei. Pitying its difficult situation in old age, they planned to buy it back, but before the negotiation could be finalized, "Old Horse" changed owners again and became the property of a bleaching factory in Longhua. Its fate continued to worsen. Even though it was over twenty years old, it still pulled heavy loads, running around without a day of rest. The cart was clumsy, and the road was rugged. Sometimes it traveled far to Songjiang, often sweating and panting under the whip, seeking death but unable to find it. Last year, the Animal Protection Society remembered "Old Horse" again, searched for its location, and went to buy it. When they arrived, they saw "Old Horse" tied in a reed shed, with only skin and bones left, and one of its feet was lame, close to death. The shed was open on two sides, and the other two sides were barely covered with miscellaneous items. A small amount of grass was spread on the ground, muddy and filthy beyond description. If "Old Horse" could speak, it would surely weep and tell of its suffering. Although "Old Horse" was almost useless to its owner, the owner still demanded a high price. The Society was short of funds and spent much effort persuading him. It was not until the Lunar New Year that they finally managed to buy it and board it at the Ascot Riding School. The Society earnestly hopes that horse lovers, or soldiers who were involved with war horses in the European War, will generously donate to provide "Old Horse" with living expenses so that it can live out its remaining years. They say that ten gold coins a month would be enough. The Society initially thought that "Old Horse" was very ill and planned to euthanize it in a humane way to relieve its pain. The "executioner" was sent to the Riding School and saw that "Old Horse" had been well-fed and its spirits had recovered. It was living comfortably in the stables and was happy. Therefore, he could not bear to do it and returned. This made me recall what Mr. Tian Guang said to Prince Yan in ancient times: "I heard that when a fine steed is in its prime, it can gallop a thousand miles a day, but when it is old and weak, a nag will overtake it." Horses are like this, and so are people. But if you meet a good master, even if you are old and weak, the master will remember your efforts when you were strong and treat you well as before. Otherwise, you will inevitably suffer the fate of "Old Horse," withering away until death. This is why heroes at the end of their road often look up to the sky, beat their chests, and weep tears of blood. However, if "Old Horse" had been mediocre and without merit when it was strong, who would pity and help it when it was in dire straits? Many other old horses have suffered the same fate as "Old Horse," but none have been rescued and escaped misfortune. As the ancient saying goes, "If you don't work hard when you are young, you will only grieve when you are old." This is indeed a wise saying.

Rambling Talk

### Talking About the Calendar (Part 1)

— Cao Yixuan

Observing the relationship between the Earth and other celestial bodies allows us to predict future changes in the seasons and calculate all the times. Recording it daily in a book, which can provide a correct and orderly basis for human life, is called a calendar. There are lunar and solar calendars. The "lunar calendar," also known as the lunar calendar, is based on the waxing and waning of the moon, using the time it takes for the moon (the moon) to orbit the Earth once as its basis. Examples include the Mohammedan calendar, the Chinese calendar, the Greek calendar, the Indian calendar, the Babylonian calendar, the Jewish calendar, etc. In ancient times, human life was closely related to the movements of the moon, and it is still important today for tidal ebb and flow and ship transportation. Therefore, the lunar calendar cannot be abolished even today. Later, it was discovered that the sun was the center of activity, and the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the sun (the day) once was taken as the standard, totaling 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. Removing the fractional number, 365 days are set as a year, and the fractional number exceeding four years is 23 hours and 15 minutes, which is taken as one day and added to the leap fourth year. In this way, there are only three days in four hundred years. However, the actual movement of the Earth is later than the calendar, so to prevent it, the year whose Western Era number 4 is removed as a leap year. Also, at the end of the number of the Western Era, the year attached with two zeros is a leap year with the year removed by 400, and the year without removal is a common year. The solar calendar used in this way includes the Egyptian calendar, the Persian calendar, the Julian calendar, and the Gregorian calendar currently used in the world. The origin of the solar calendar was in the era of King Romulus of Rome before 750 BC. After various improvements, it has been implemented to this day. We pass one day after another without any special feelings, but the number of days each day, such as February 28 and July-August 31, are very unequal. The month of 28 days and 31 days has four Sundays, people who live on monthly wages, apart from the four Sundays, only have 24 and 27 days, so the shortcomings of the calendar should be improved. However, the reform of the calendar has become a problem 150 years ago. The French revolutionaries who advocated rationalism and the destruction of tradition were firmly opposed to the 28th day of February, and also fundamentally broke the Roman calendar and time. They advocated using ten hours as a day, dividing the hour into percentages, abolishing weeks and using decades, with one month being 30 days, and the remaining five days being attached at the end of the year. The most interesting of these was to establish the autumnal equinox at the beginning of the year, and use this day as the anniversary of the declaration of the abolition of the monarchy, calling it the Republican calendar. This calendar was implemented for thirteen years, and then it was realized that it was too unreasonable and it was abolished. However, the current Gregorian solar calendar is still incomplete, although it has been improved for 400 years, it is still inappropriate, and it has even been changed for the worse, that is, the day and year are natural units, and the week is an artificial unit. They have been trying to come up with an excellent improvement plan. In 1923, the League of Nations paid attention to correcting the calendar and set up an investigation committee to notify the governments of various countries in 1927, hoping to investigate and study the calendar. Later, two improvement plans were obtained. One was the thirteen-month case of Auguste Comte, the ancestor of positive philosophy. The case took the week as a unit, combined four weeks and 28 days as a month, and thirteen months and 364 days as a year. Therefore, one day was left over in a common year, and two days were left over in a leap year. These remaining days were the days outside the week and were placed at the beginning or end of the year. Because the first day of the year is set as Sunday, the rest of the month can also be inferred. This is the convenience of connecting the calendar day and Sunday, but dividing the year into two or four is inconvenient.

### "Abyssinia" in "Shanghai"

— Xiao Mei

The film "Abyssinia" in Shanghai was initially suspended due to protests. The Central Film Censorship Committee recalled the film, re-examined it carefully, and, after cutting out the most intense parts, re-approved it for public release in Shanghai. The original intent of this cautious approach was to pass through peacefully without incident. However, the result was not so. The backlash was still there, and it was even more intense. In addition to wooden sticks and pistols, there was also ammonia and other "civilized weapons." With such weapons, there was naturally no need to go through diplomatic procedures. "Might makes right." It must be joyous to use force to destroy what one deems to be odious! Moreover, although the real King of Abyssinia is now at the end of his heroic road and the Abyssinian people are now living under a "civilized" rule, the King of Abyssinia on the screen is still depicted as being so passionately plotting rebellion. Isn't this a matter that "concerns the national essence" of the "civilized" Italy? Treating the "Abyssinia" film with the same methods used against the barbaric people of Abyssinia is meant as a slight punishment and to tell people that Italy's means of "instilling civilization" are still in place. These means are not only earnestly implemented on Abyssinian soil, but will also be earnestly implemented wherever the shadow of the resistance of the Abyssinian people is found.

Such a "civilized" "great undertaking" naturally leaves us gaping in astonishment. However, regrettably, such a "civilized" "great undertaking" does not seem grand enough, not grand enough to inspire awe. For example, on the day before Italian sailors promoted civilization in Shanghai, in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Abyssinia, "Abyssinians who were dissatisfied with Italian rule mingled among the crowd and threw hand grenades," injuring many important Italian officials who were going to the church to celebrate the birth of Prince of Naples. As for how things will develop in Shanghai, it is still impossible to predict, but the act of lodging a protest is inevitable, and it is clear that there will be no peace.

Regarding lodging protests, the district branches of the Shanghai Hongri District Citizens' Association have jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Joint General Association, requesting it to forward it to the municipal government and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding "strict negotiations to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, so as to safeguard social harmony." As for the central government, there has been no further news yet, but for the sake of the Central Film Censorship Committee's authority, I believe that a protest will also definitely be lodged soon. The Shanghai Grand Theatre and other relevant parties will also certainly petition the Central Censorship Committee to uphold justice. But what will happen after the protest is lodged? I am quietly waiting to see.

The matter cannot be concluded with just a protest. "Ensuring that similar incidents do not happen again, so as to safeguard social harmony" is too abstract a statement. Infringing on our sovereignty and insulting our national dignity are, of course, the most important and major issues at present! And what is more practical and urgently needs to be resolved is the Central Film Censorship Committee's authority. If films that have been approved by the Central Government can be casually shut down like this, how can one ask how to handle imported films that refuse to be censored in the future?

Therefore, in order to demonstrate the authority of the Central Film Censorship Committee and to guarantee it in fact, I believe that the text of the protest should include a clause stating that "the "Abyssinia" film that was approved this time should not be subject to any restrictions to continue showing within Chinese territory." And, in order for this not to be a pro forma measure, the original film should be shown publicly in Shanghai or other places on the day the negotiations are resolved.

### Water Carrier

— Zhang Haopu

As usual, as soon as the lama of Huguo Temple strikes the bell, the winch operator, old man crooked neck, gets up. His movements are very quiet, to avoid waking up those water carriers who are sleeping soundly. He lights the stove himself, pours a pot of water to sit on, and then puts on leggings and binds his socks. Finally, he took a small oil bottle and oiled the cores and ears of each carrier's cart. Then, he sang two lines from "Famen Temple" in Liu Jin's voice, waking up all the water carriers. The kettle on the stove was hissing, and when the water was about to boil, everyone got up! Smoking, washing faces, wrapping foot cloths. Crooked Neck alone opened the trough lid. He was talking to the carter "Big Sun." "Big Sun" was the first to come every morning, leading two red horses to drink.

Life is rigid and mundane, and pain has left a deep mark on their bodies. They numbly live through difficult days, not knowing how to improve their lives, and have lost the desire for a good life. Recalling the past, they even feel that the present days are very happy. In the past, the Yellow River flooded, washing away their houses, fields, and cattle. Even their parents and wives died or scattered. They themselves escaped to a distant place and became soldiers, thinking that they could become rich as soldiers. However, after fighting several battles, it was not them who were promoted and made money, but those officials. Disappointed, they had to risk their lives to "desert." Now they finally had a means of livelihood, earning three or five yuan a month. Let's keep this job, wishful thinking cannot solve hunger and thirst. They are completely obedient and submissive slaves to the well owner, earning countless amounts of money for the well owner, while what they get is pitifully small! The well owners are very vicious. People in Beijing call them "water valves" because they often argue and fight with people who use water, raising the price of water. But it is only the water carriers who suffer. They have no space for adults, working non-stop like cattle and horses, and if they make a mistake, they will be laid off.

The most arduous task is the winch operator, Crooked Neck! He doesn't smoke, and doesn't rest at all. When he puts down the winch, he takes care of the stove, cooks, washes clothes, and nails shoes for the water carriers! He is simply the mother of the carters. Everyone treats him warmly, and he also lovingly protects each partner. Although he earns two yuan more than others, he takes it out for everyone to spend, buying small dishes, buying rock sugar sprouts, etc. In short, the two yuan more he earns are all spent on others. He is already over forty years old.

### Plunging Straight into the Enemy's Lair

— Megatron

Using powerful forces to plunge straight into the enemy's lair, exterminating bandits and thieves, can be called a great pleasure.

When gonorrhea first begins, it is often due to mistakenly taking inferior medicine or being careless with washing, causing the bacteria to penetrate deep into the urethra and invade the testicles, resulting in inflammation of the testicles and swelling pain in the urethra, as if being cut by a knife.

The new medicine "Deli Ping" combines various components whose power can completely kill the stubborn gonorrhea bacteria that have deeply penetrated the urethra. At the same time, it can exert its anti-inflammatory, astringent, pain-relieving, and turbidity-clearing effects on inflamed conjunctiva, absolutely without harming the stomach and intestines, kidneys, or any other side effects. Among internal gonorrhea medicines, this can be called the most perfect preparation, far beyond what other ordinary and superficial medicines can compare with.

Taking the new medicine "Deli Ping" to plunge straight into the enemy's lair and kill gonorrhea bacteria is also a great pleasure.

### Women's Lecture

— Hu Huizhen

Reasons for Weakness

We women in general are weak because of insufficient exercise; depressed because of living in seclusion; blood-deficient because of believing in the menstrual cycle; and tired because of raising children. These are the major reasons for women's weakness!

Even More So in Our Country

Women are more prone to physical weakness, mental decline, qi and blood deficiency, aging appearance, and susceptibility to disease compared to men. This is even more so in our country's environment!

Remedies

The remedies for women's weakness, in addition to improving lifestyle, should also include taking health-strengthening medicines. Many of my female friends, after taking Wuzhou Pharmaceutical's "Women's Essence," have had all their previous ailments disappear, so I believe this is a wonderful medicine for gynecology.

He had never married. He himself said he had never slept with a woman since he was born. Sometimes, when others talked about women, he was quite moved. If you asked him, "Crooked Neck, how about it? Want to find a wife?" he would smile with his teeth showing and go back to cranking his winch. Clatter, clatter, endless life slipped away on the winch.

Crooked Neck steamed the cornbread, sliced the pickled radish, and added a bit of vinegar and soy sauce to mix it. When the water carriers returned one after another, they began to eat breakfast. The three meals a day were all the same: cornbread and pickled vegetables.

As dusk approached, the pace quickened with the water carriers becoming increasingly rushed, wishing they had extra hands and feet. This was the hardest part of the job! During the day, the muddy streets had frozen over, but not solidly, so that each footstep created a pit. In particular, a cart full of water always sank deeply into the mud, making it exceptionally difficult to pull. The water carriers were all covered in sweat, with steam rising from their foreheads, exerting all their strength to deal with the cart. The most difficult part was the muddy road that had not completely frozen. If their feet didn't find purchase, they'd slip and overturn the cart, injuring themselves, or at least get covered in mud. The well owner would be sure to scold you severely, and who could you complain to?

Every evening at dusk, a flock of crows gathered in the old locust trees in the Huguo Temple courtyard. They shrieked mournfully in the cold, quiet night, unsure whether they were lamenting for the water carriers. Their hands flew, swiftly swinging the long-handled dippers, filling a cart with water in no time. Crooked Neck was also busy at this time, the water in the trough shallow and then deep, but Crooked Neck never received complaints from the cart pullers. He never let the water trough run dry, and the well owner praised him for doing a good job with this task.

What was hateful were the people who needed water, especially during the busiest times when they were quick to urge: "Little Wen! Hurry up and pour! Haven't poured water since early morning!" No one had time to pay attention to these people, and they kept letting down water carts, no matter how sore their arms were, they had to grit their teeth and endure. As soon as a cart was filled, they would throw down the large dipper and push the cart away.

As night enveloped the ancient city, the water carriers all pushed their empty carts back. They stood the carts up on the ground, removed the wooden plugs on the water tanks, and let the remaining water drain out. After taking a smoke, everyone pulled out a small coin pouch from their waists, counted the money, and handed it over to the well owner, coin by coin. After the well owner left with the money and carrying his birdcage, they swarmed to the stove, sat on small stools, and took off their soaked shoes and foot wraps.

As soon as the steamer basket was opened, the cornbread steamed. Everyone grabbed one to warm their hands. After washing their hands, they started eating. Slowly, their bodies became sore, and fatigue fermented! One by one, they fell onto the bed like black bears, closed their eyes, and fell asleep, unable to be awakened by any sound. Crooked Neck picked up this and tidied up that until everyone else had fallen asleep and the seller of "hard-baked cakes" had yelled past Da Yangjia Hutong, and only then did he go to bed.

### Night Inspection

— Mi Lan

— Miscellany of Shenyang

The night was as dark as lacquer. Although it was not raining, a malicious wind was blowing hard outside. This street, which was very noisy during the day, was now also immersed in deep darkness. In the distance, only the sound of iron-shod leather shoes and gun butts striking the road planks hurriedly and abruptly vibrated...

For the past few days, the friendly forces had been arresting people more intensely than usual, for reasons unknown. As a result, this ancient and bustling city of Shenyang was entirely shrouded in an atmosphere of chaos and terror.

Martial law began at six o'clock in the evening. As soon as you stepped out of the door, armed soldiers would stop you on the road, aiming their guns at your waist in an offensive stance, and carefully search your belongings...

Because of this, I would hide in my room every evening, shrink my head, and burrow into the blankets. But my room was very narrow, and I felt stifled and suffocated from being confined in it all day. Sometimes, I would just push a crack in the street-facing window to get some air and also peek at the scene outside. But all I saw were brown military vehicles, brown-clad armed soldiers, and the shiny guns on their shoulders... These only added to the trembling throughout my body!

This had been going on for four days and nights. Suddenly, one evening, a message came from the tea servant Liu Fu, saying that they were going to "inspect the night" house by house that night.

What were they inspecting? - I called Liu Fu in and asked him. He couldn't answer and just cast a pair of resentful eyes at my face.

"These guys are really unreasonable..." As he said this, he quickly shook his head again. "They simply treat us common people here as pigs that are easy to bully!"

When he left the room, he sighed deeply.

I stared blankly at his retreating figure for a while, then turned back to gaze through the window: outside, the night continued to creep deeper and deeper into the darkness silently. On the street, all the sounds were also clearly transmitted into my ears... !

Less than a quarter of an hour later, Liu Fu suddenly burst into the door, cowering with his back bent, he put on a frightened look and approached my ear to whisper:

"Outside... the people from XX are here to inspect the night."

"Have they come in yet!" I was stunned, my face seemed to be burning, and I asked, "How many people are there?"

"There are many people!" Liu Fu frowned tightly at me, then comforted me, "It's okay, now, now they're still downstairs, but you should quickly tidy up the books, because books are the most troublesome..."

After saying this, he hurried out.

This time my heart was hung up again. But I tried my best to calm down and reluctantly tidied up the suitcase and locked it. Although I didn't bring anything, I was afraid of unexpected trouble!

A burst of chaotic footsteps followed on the stairs, from far to near, gradually stopping at my door.

"Open the door, huh!" A few sounds rang on the door, and my heartbeat became more impulsive. Finally, I hardened my head and pulled open the door.

A flashlight was shining directly on me, the strong light like thousands of golden flies demonstrating in front of me. Suddenly, a fist as big as a bowl pressed against my chest, and someone on this side also reached out, holding a gun in their hand.

They were a group of five or six people, and at first none of them spoke, just carefully examining my room. After a while, Liu Fu tremblingly brought over a piece of paper - I didn't recognize the writing on the paper, what did it mean? I was also confused, just at this moment, one of them started asking me questions.

I told them my hometown, name, and age...

They used a not very fluent "China" accent, and still asked in detail, looking like they were interrogating a criminal.

"You're not from outside the pass, why did you come here?" A black-faced soldier asked me:

"..." I moved my mouth and then continued, "I came to find a friend."

"Friend?" he asked with difficulty: "Where does he live?"

"On XX Street." I answered him solemnly.

"What does he do?"

"He is also doing business!" I still kept calm, not letting them see that I was trembling.

"Oh!" The black-faced guy finally put his gun away.

They mumbled among themselves for a while, and for some reason, they insisted on checking my luggage. The first one was the black-faced guy who violently beat the nearby boxes with an iron rod, and also ordered me with wide eyes:

"Open it quickly, come on..."

I wriggled and shook my shoulders, and with a pleading attitude, I said to them:

"Most of these are clothes, please be a little more lenient, okay?"

The black-faced guy seemed like a deaf person, his expression not even moving his mouth. Liu Fu gave me a look, and I understood what he meant, they wanted money, just now downstairs it seemed like someone was arguing about five or ten yuan!

"How much do you want?" I asked Liu Fu in a low voice.

But before Liu Fu could answer, the black-faced guy stretched out a hand. - Representing five yuan.

I deliberately pretended to be in difficulty, gathered all the four yuan or so I had on me and handed them over, and immediately everything became negotiable, and the five or six black shadows swayed out.

I turned around and looked again at the dim night outside the window, and felt the empty bottom of my bag. Is this what they call "night inspection"?

Falling Rosy Clouds and Lone Duck

Falling Rosy Clouds was a young girl kidnapped by bandits and sold to Zhao Chongfu's family, where she suffered all kinds of abuse from the mistress, Mrs. Zhao. However, she always endured and worked diligently.

One winter morning, in gloomy weather with a strong wind and goose feather snowflakes falling, Falling Rosy Clouds braved the heavy snow in thin clothes to go to the market to buy vegetables. Unfortunately, she was careless and lost the money for the vegetables. She knew that she would be beaten severely when she returned, so she stood in the snow and cried bitterly. Fortunately, Jiang Qiuwu passed by, inquired about the reason, and generously gave her one yuan and fifty cents, saving Falling Rosy Clouds from a beating.

Ever since Jiang Qiuwu helped her, the image of a handsome young man often flashed in Falling Rosy Clouds' mind. Every day, she passed by the place where Jiang Qiuwu had helped her and stood there in a daze. One day, another snowy morning, she returned from the market after buying vegetables, and happened to meet Jiang Qiuwu going to Qiuren Middle School to teach. Because she wanted to ask his name, she followed him all the way to the gate of Qiuren Middle School, and through the mouths of two elementary school students, she learned that his name was Jiang Qiuwu, and she went home very satisfied; but because she had been delayed, she was beaten all over by her mistress, even to the point of being unable to work.

After three or four days, Falling Rosy Clouds' injuries had not yet healed, but Mrs. Zhao forced her to get up and work. That afternoon, Zhao Chongfu returned very early and happened to meet his cousin Zhu Liufeng visiting, so the two of them were eating fried chestnuts and peanuts in the living room and chatting idly, while Falling Rosy Clouds was serving them. During their conversation, she learned that Jiang Qiuwu was a revolutionary. At that time, it was the era of warlords, and the military and police agencies were very attentive to him. Within two or three hours, Jiang Qiuwu's life would be in danger. After hearing these words, Falling Rosy Clouds secretly ran to Qiuren Middle School, led Jiang Qiuwu to Granny Feng's house next door, and told him the news that the military and police agencies were secretly arresting revolutionaries, saving him from escaping the tiger's mouth.

After Jiang Qiuwu returned south from Beijing, he often thought of Falling Rosy Clouds' life-saving grace, so he wrote two letters to Wan You, the errand boy at Qiuren Middle School, asking him to inquire about Falling Rosy Clouds' whereabouts and giving him ten yuan for travel expenses. Wan You could not refuse, so he took the letter for Falling Rosy Clouds and went to Tianxiang Hutong to find Granny Feng, entrusting her to forward it; because there was a profit to be made, she readily agreed. However, at this time, the Zhao family had already moved to Huai Shu Hutong in the West City, so she could not see Falling Rosy Clouds every day. One clear morning, Granny Feng specially went to West City to visit Falling Rosy Clouds and happened to meet her in Huai Shu Hutong, so she handed Jiang Qiuwu's letter to her, completing her duty as a matchmaker.

Everyone has a father. Only I have none. Everyone has a mother, only I have none. White clouds leisurely. River water flows eastward. Little birds return and have no nest. Children want to return and have no boat. Where to find the source. Where to find the source. Don't say the child is an abandoned lamb. Don't say the child has cried his heart out. The pain of this world. Is not just losing parents. Arise, orphans, wake up. Lambs who have lost their way. Put away your painful groans. Offer your innocent hearts. Respect the elderly as our own and extend it to others. Love the young as our own and extend it to others. Put away your painful groans. Offer your innocent hearts. Service and sacrifice. Service and sacrifice. Impartial selflessness. Vast river water. Misty white clouds. Solemn universe exists forever. Great harmony and universal love. Share family affection.

Reporting the new spring at the top of all flowers. Opening in Yuling, it brightens the eyes. The wind and bones are good in front of the Jade Zhaotang. Pointing out the new in the Hanzhang Hall. The best product of the Shanglin is the purple stem. The alchemy of Qili is not yet golden. A touch of rouge is as thin as the cheeks. Across the river, the pine and bamboo have a deep friendship. Fluttering fragrant snow, the mist is cold. Desolate frozen clouds, the fences are shady. Jixia once made a vow of unity. Hengyu Xiangqi had an intimate relationship. The scenery of Yangzhou is empty to recall. Leisurely singing in the East Pavilion increases interest. The north and south branches are originally connected. The opening and falling are different. Light makeup welcomes and sends off the dreams of Luofu, startling the green feathers after being drunk. The recluse of Gushan has deep feelings. Remembering the smiles under the eaves. Snow is easy to dissipate for friends. Frost is the matchmaker, the letter is silent. Jade butterflies fly and gather on the branches. Plain clothes welcome with joy. Qiongzi is suitable to live on Yaotai. Once approaching the villages by the stream. Pear blossoms are difficult to distinguish in dreams, flattering words do not hinder Guangping's chastity. Three thatched houses with thousands of trees. The sound of the flute is heard in Jiangcheng in May. Green leaves become shade to bear fruit. Where to find the secluded soul of cold fragrance. Remotely send a branch to bother the postman. Looking at the horizon, I miss my old friends. It's only good to teach Jiangbei and Jiangnan to miss them earnestly.

### Following the Magnificent Garden, "The Grand Assembly of Buckman's Flowers" Will Be Performed at the Carlton the Day After Tomorrow

Possessing 80 actors and 40 beauties, the Grand Assembly of Buckman's Flowers has long been famous worldwide. It has toured various countries around the world, earning acclaim wherever it goes. Its reputation is no less than that of the Grand Flower Troupe. When the Haiking Bo Circus came to Shanghai to perform, a few Buckman's artists participated, and Shanghai people were surprised to see it as a spectacle, which shows the extraordinary skills of the singing and dancing. Now the entire troupe is coming to Shanghai for the first time, and the Carlton Theater on Park Road has hired them at a high price, scheduled to perform day and night from the 25th of this month (i.e., the day after tomorrow). According to the theater's strict selection of song and dance troupes, the Grand Flower Troupe performed in the theater a few years ago. This Grand Assembly of Buckman's Flowers is enough to compete with the Grand Flower Troupe, presenting a new and uninhibited style to meet the people of Shanghai.

### Theme Song of "Song at Midnight"

(1) Fireflies fly in the empty courtyard, raccoons walk on the high platform, people accompany the lonely lamp, and the clapper knocks at the third watch.

(2) The wind is bleak, the rain is pouring, flowers fall in disorder, leaves flutter, in this long and dark night, who is waiting for dawn with me?

(3) My shape is as hideous as a ghost, my heart is as firm as iron, as long as I have a breath left, I vow to fight against the feudal demon king.

(4) Ah, girl, only your eyes can see through my life; only your heart can understand my feelings.

(5) You are the moon in the sky, I am the cold star beside the moon; you are the tree on the mountain, I am the withered vine on the tree; you are the water in the pond, I am the duckweed on the water.

(6) No, girl, I am willing to be a person in the tomb forever, getting rid of worldly fame; I am willing to learn from the historian who suffered punishment, writing out the injustice of the world.

(7) Oh, girl, the sky is dark, the earth is gloomy, what can I use to express my anger? Only the surging tide of the river. What can I use to comfort your loneliness? Only the song at midnight! Only the song at midnight!

### About "A Match Made in Heaven"

"A Match Made in Heaven" is a new Lianhua film that will be released soon, a domestic comedy.

Because of the heaviness of life, the petty bourgeois audience generally loves to laugh and relax, so Chaplin's works have a strong box office appeal, and Laurel and Hardy's antics have also become the most familiar names to the audience. There are not many Chinese comedies, and if there are one or two, they are generally lacking in oiliness and have little meaning.

The director of "A Match Made in Heaven" is Shen Fu, starring Han Langan, Bai Lu, Liu Jiqun, and Yin Xiucen. Han Langan plays a small worker here. He is simple, honest, and full of dreams, just like the characters played by Chaplin. Bai Lu is a poor girl who is charming and has a good heart, but the environment forces her to become a prostitute. The story is very touching, and it is subtle and humorous; there are many laughs, but it is not a riot, which makes the audience with a deeper understanding feel disgusted. The ending of this play can be said to be "tragic." Although it makes people laugh, it makes people feel heavy in their hearts after laughing.

The audience who loves Lianhua movies will probably not miss the opportunity to appreciate it, right?
