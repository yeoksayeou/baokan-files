### Enemy Plots to Take Wusong and Luodian: Our Army is Highly Alert and Ready

Fierce Battles Expected in the Next Day or Two. Bloody Fighting in Wusong Continues Throughout the Day, Enemy Unable to Succeed. Enemy Attempts to Counterattack in Jiangwan and Zhabei Repeatedly Repelled.

As of 4:00 AM this morning, the battle situation on all fronts is as follows: 
㊀ In the Yangshupu, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas, the enemy launched repeated counterattacks, all of which were bravely repelled by our troops. Our defenses are extremely solid, and the front lines remain unchanged.
㊁ The fighting in the Wusong area is the most intense. The enemy reinforced their forces, and under the cover of aircraft and artillery, another 2,000 men landed, launching a full-scale attack on our positions. In the evening, our fresh troops arrived and engaged in the most fierce bloody battle. By 2:00 AM this morning, the artillery fire had subsided slightly. The stubborn enemy has been surrounded by our forces. Wusong Fort, Taiwan, and Baoshan County are definitely in our hands. Rumors of their loss are absolutely false.
㊂ The remnants of the enemy in the Caowangmiao area between Luodian and Liuhe were defeated by our troops. We pursued the victory to Shengqiao, north of Luodian Town.
㊃ The enemy's military plan is to attempt to encircle Yuepu Town with the main forces on the left and right wings, in an attempt to open up communication between Wusong and Luodian. Our side has already deployed heavy troops in the area, and the enemy will definitely not succeed. The enemy troops have been landing in the Wusong and Luodian areas for nearly ten days. They have suffered heavy blows from our army, sustaining significant injuries. However, the enemy's strategy still focuses on developing these areas. Yesterday, under the cover of artillery and aircraft bombardment, another 2,000 men landed in the Fort Taiwan and Wusong Town area, and planned to attack Yuepu Town in an attempt to open up communication between the Wusong area and Luodian. Our army has already deployed heavy troops in Yuepu Town, highly alert and ready. Fierce battles are expected in the next day or two. Central News Agency, according to confirmed midnight news, the enemy's reinforcements of 2,000 men forcibly landed in Wusong Town again yesterday morning. More than a dozen enemy planes bombed and shelled our military positions from the air. Enemy warships in the river also fired intensively with artillery. Our defending troops, regardless of sacrifice, bravely countered the landing enemy troops. After several hours of fierce fighting, the town was forced to retreat slightly due to its proximity to the river and the enemy's excessive artillery fire. After landing, the enemy continued to invade towards Baoshan. Our reinforcements arrived and, taking advantage of the enemy's unstable positions, launched a fierce frontal attack, killing and wounding hundreds of enemy soldiers, who then retreated to Wusong Town. Our army did not pursue them and is now defending a solid position, confronting the enemy. The enemy's attempt to communicate with the remaining enemy forces in Luodian will definitely not succeed.

Bloody Battles Raged All Day in Wusong

In the Wusong area, both sides were engaged in fierce battles from yesterday morning to evening. After our fresh troops arrived, they surrounded the enemy on three sides and are still encircling and suppressing them. The enemy has suffered heavy losses after days of encirclement and suppression by our army. Therefore, around 11:00 PM last night (July 31st), additional enemy reinforcements, divided into eight merchant ships, arrived at the mouth of Wusong. One of them, protected by another warship, sailed to the Liuhe area, while the rest gathered 50 nautical miles outside the mouth of Wusong.

Near Wusong Town, fierce battles continued from morning to dusk yesterday. Both sides suffered casualties. Several fires broke out in the town, and the burning intensified at noon. Baoshan County and nearby villages were also hit by enemy artillery shells, causing fires in many places and significant losses.

Our Army in Luodian Reaches Shengqiao

In the Luodian area, yesterday, our [illegible] division advanced to Caowangmiao, Pujiamiao, and Shixianggongmiao, and then continued to advance north. The enemy troops retreated westward, with only about 500 remnants remaining. Under the victorious momentum of our army, step by step, our army has now reached Shengqiao, north of Luodian. Many enemies were killed in this battle, and many enemy supplies were seized.

Yesterday afternoon, a military agency received a front-line report that the enemy troops in the northwest of Luodian had been repelled by our army and their camp occupied. The enemy troops launched a fierce counterattack on our army's positions in Luodian Town from the night before, under the cover of their warships and artillery. Our army immediately rose up to counterattack, and the sounds of guns and artillery were continuous. After 6:00 AM yesterday morning, more than a dozen enemy planes came to help in the battle. Our loyal and brave soldiers, despite being heavily pressed by enemy artillery fire, still bathed in blood and pounced on the enemy.

Enemy Routed in Jiangwan and Zhabei

At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, more than 300 enemy troops attempted to invade the Far East Sports Field in the Yinhang District, and secretly built pontoon bridges at Guanyinqiao and Yangjiazai nearby, hoping to cross the river secretly and attack our positions. Our army waited in ambush, and when they crossed to the middle of the river, they immediately opened fire with guns and artillery. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy troops fled in panic. Countless enemies were shot, wounded, and drowned. Our army took advantage of the victory and pursued them to the vicinity of Wangjiazai. Only about 200 enemy troops remained, and our army is continuing to pursue them.

Hundreds of remnants of the enemy near Dingjia Lane, near the Japanese Naval Hospital on Jiangwan Road, launched a full-scale counterattack on our positions at the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Our army immediately responded and used mortars, small steel cannons, and machine guns to fiercely sweep the enemy. As a result, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. Yesterday morning, on Chunjiang Road in Zhabei, the enemy troops launched a sudden attack under the cover of artillery, attacking our positions. Our army responded calmly, and after fierce fighting between the two sides until 10:00 AM, the enemy finally collapsed and retreated.

Enemy Suffers Heavy Blows at Qujiang Wharf

Yesterday morning, a part of the enemy troops landed at the Qujiang Wharf, and another small team invaded us at Guanyintang, behind the Qujiang Wharf. They were met with a head-on blow by our defending troops and were unsuccessful. Also, yesterday morning, a small number of enemy soldiers landed at Lujiazha. Our army initially pretended not to know, and when the enemy landed one after another, our army suddenly attacked, firing guns and artillery. The enemy troops were caught off guard, suffered heavy casualties, and collapsed.

Enemy Troops Block Off Yangshupu District

Shenzhou News Agency reports that the enemy troops, relying on the concession's eastern district as a base, have provoked us. Due to repeated defeats, the enemy is now eager to completely turn the area into a military stronghold in order to resist us. On July 31st, they ordered all poor residents living in the area to evacuate in order to station troops in the civilian houses and build fortifications. Yesterday, they blocked off the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas. Even Westerners were restricted from entering and leaving. Yesterday, the enemy's headquarters declared to foreign reporters that the Hongkou and Yangshupu blockade areas, in addition to prohibiting Chinese from entering and leaving, allow foreigners to enter the area who are members of the Municipal Council Police, the International Volunteer Corps, Chinese Municipal Council Police in uniform, foreign soldiers, and Westerners holding permits issued by the Third Fleet Commander or the Japanese Consulate, and foreign employees hired by Japanese merchants with permits. As for foreigners residing in the blockade area holding permits from the Japanese Consulate General, they are only allowed to enter and leave the southern sections of the following areas: (A) Hongkou: Bazilu, Diswei Road; (B) Yangshupu: Tangshan Road, Xihuaide Road, Beikai'er Road, Pingliang Road, Haizhou Road, and Linqing Road. As for the warehouses along the wharf area, except for those owned by Chinese and Japanese, those belonging to other countries are temporarily allowed to open. It is also said that Chinese and Westerners employed by the Japanese can enter and leave the naval restricted area without hindrance. The Waibaidu Bridge is open from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, and will be temporarily closed after that. This kind of barbaric behavior by the Japanese army is likely to endanger residents. It is reported that the Municipal Council will issue a notice ordering the Chinese in the area to evacuate in order to avoid the danger of the police being unable to intervene.

Enemy Reinforcements of Three Divisions Arrive in Shanghai

Since yesterday, the enemy's military positions in the Yangshupu area have been taken over by regular army troops. The remaining marines who were originally stationed there have been transferred to the Hongkou area, seemingly in urgent need of replenishment.

Central News Agency reports that since the August 13th Incident, the enemy's naval marines have been repeatedly defeated by our army and have retreated step by step. The enemy is now sparing no effort to pour its national elite into invading our territory again, attempting a final desperate effort. The reinforcements that have arrived in Shanghai one after another have reached a total of three divisions. The army that has arrived in Shanghai is composed of the country's elite troops, mixed and matched, including the Fukuoka 12th Brigade of the Kurume 12th Division, the Ikushima 22nd Brigade of the Kokura 11th Division, the Yamaguchi 21st Brigade of the Hiroshima 5th Division, the Shizuoka 29th Brigade of the Nagoya 3rd Division, the Tsuruga 18th Brigade of the Kanazawa 9th Division, and the Kagoshima 36th Brigade of the Kumamoto 6th Division.

Enemy Warships Continue to Transport Weapons and Ammunition to Shanghai

After the enemy ships Beifa Maru, Tianxiang Maru, and Shanghai Maru arrived in Shanghai one after another and unloaded large quantities of weapons and ammunition, another enemy transport ship and a merchant ship sailed to Shanghai the night before. The transport ship docked at the Zhaoshang North Bund Wharf, and since the night before, 30 to 40 Japanese soldiers have been unloading ammunition. When reporters passed by the area at 11:00 AM yesterday, they witnessed a steel cannon being transported from the ship to the wharf. Another merchant ship (name unknown) docked at the Huishan Wharf, and 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers were also unloading ammunition, and more than a dozen war horses were unloaded from the ship at the same time. The enemy's urgent reinforcements show the unfavorable nature of the war after their invasion of Shanghai and the extent of their losses.

Enemy Warships Bombard Our Pudong Again

At 3:30 PM yesterday, an enemy gunboat moored near the No. 11 buoy near the Huangpu Wharf frequently bombarded our positions in the Pudong area, and stopped around 4:00 PM.

Enemy Troops in Hongkou Rotate Day and Night

It is confirmed that the enemy in Hongkou has been surrounded by our army for a long time. In order to adjust, the enemy troops are defended by the marines and veterans during the day, and the regular army is replaced at night to counterattack. However, because the positions cannot be deployed and our army's defenses are tight, the enemy is difficult to succeed.

Enemy Troops Cut Off Pudong River Pontoons

Central News Agency reports that in order to facilitate landing, the enemy troops have cut off many of the pontoons on both sides of the Huangpu River and towed them to the places where they plan to land in order to build temporary wharves. When reporters passed the Huangpu River yesterday (1st), they saw five or six pontoons on the Pudong shore of the Taitong Coal Wharf across from the Huishan Wharf had been cut off and used by the enemy.

Enemy Warships Often Cruise in Chongming

According to a telegram from Chongming County, enemy warships have been cruising in the waters near the island in recent days, but the area is still quiet as of the time of the telegram.

Youths Fighting Against the Enemy Depart for the Front Lines

Several members of the China Youth Anti-Enemy Salvation Corps, led by Zhao Gangyi and Fan Tianjiao, left for the front lines for work at 7:00 PM last night (1st). After their service in the area is completed, they will be transferred to other locations, such as XX, to engage in guard work.

Various Places in Southern Shanghai Were Bombed Again Yesterday

Central News Agency reports that at 6:40 PM yesterday, an enemy plane flew to Nanshi and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area for reconnaissance. When the plane flew to the outside of Chezhan Road in Nanshi, near Rihui Bridge, it dropped two bombs, one in an open space and one in the river nearby, without any losses.

Investigation of Enemy Warships in Huangpu River Yesterday

Central News Agency reports that, according to investigations by reporters yesterday, most of the enemy warships that sailed to Shanghai are gathered in the Wusong River and Liuhe areas. From Zhanghuabang, through Yunzaobang to Wusong Town, to Fort Taiwan, Lion Grove, and Liuhe, there are enemy warships stationed every mile or so, and their total number is more than 60. In addition, there are 20 to 30 merchant ships for transporting soldiers and ammunition. As for the area within Donggou, there were a total of 17 enemy warships moored yesterday, and their distribution is as follows: one destroyer at the Huangpu Wharf, one transport ship at the Zhaoshang North Bund, two destroyers at the Mitsubishi Wharf (one is No. 21, the other's name has been painted over), one destroyer at the No. 1 buoy, one Izumo flagship at the No. 2 buoy, one gunboat at the No. 4 buoy, one destroyer each at the No. 6, No. 7, and No. 10 buoys, one gunboat at the No. 11 buoy, one destroyer at the No. 13 buoy, one gunboat at the No. 16 buoy, ten destroyers each at the No. 17 and No. 19 buoys, one gunboat each at the No. 22 and No. 35 buoys, and one Japanese merchant ship moored at the Huishan Wharf, with 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers, who were still continuing to unload ammunition as of 5:00 PM. More than 100 Japanese soldiers at the Huishan Wharf were also busy transporting ammunition.

Enemy Also Arrests Ships Retrieving Corpses

The bodies of innocent civilians killed by Japanese soldiers in the Huangpu River flow with the waves, numbering no less than one hundred. For both moral and sanitary reasons, various charitable organizations are preparing to retrieve them, but difficulties have arisen in the process. Yesterday, four customs patrol boats were rowing to the Huangpu River in the Hongkou area to retrieve corpses when they were suddenly arrested and detained by the Japanese army. They were released after a long time after negotiations by the customs tax officer. Other ships, such as the Lifesaving Bureau patrol boats, have even more difficulty trying to retrieve the bodies. Therefore, how to deal with the large number of floating corpses in the Huangpu River has become a problem.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bridge Destroyed by Enemy Aircraft Again Yesterday

Damage is Extremely Severe, Difficult to Repair Temporarily. Shanghai West Station is Also Threatened

Destroyed Railway Bridge

Central News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the Songhu War, most of the refugees in Shanghai have been taking trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to escape because the waterways were blocked. However, on the afternoon of August 28th, the Shanghai South Railway Station was suddenly destroyed by enemy aircraft, and the waiting refugees were killed and wounded, numbering as many as five or six hundred. The scene was a bloody mess and unbearable to witness. At 12:00 noon on August 29th, a railway bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was also heavily damaged by enemy aircraft. Passenger cars could not pass, and repairs were extremely difficult. In order to transport refugees, the railway bureau worked overnight and risked repairs. However, yesterday (1st), at 9:30 AM, three enemy aircraft flew over the bridge and dropped several bombs, causing extremely severe damage and making it difficult to repair in a short period of time. When the enemy aircraft dropped bombs, the director of the bureau's engineering department, Huaide Haosi, and the design section chief, Xu Chengkuang, were supervising the repairs at the work site, fortunately they were not injured, but tens of thousands of refugees will have no way to escape.

Bombing West Station

Central News Agency reports that enemy aircraft wantonly destroy our transportation facilities and massacre our innocent people. The tragic case of the South Railway Station on August 28th has already aroused negative impressions among people from all countries. However, these violent enemies are bloodthirsty by nature. At 3:00 PM yesterday, eight enemy aircraft flew low over the Shanghai West Station (Fanhangdu) area, circling back and forth for about an hour, seemingly with some intention, causing the refugees waiting for trains at the station to panic and scatter to hide. The aircraft then dropped more than a dozen bombs in the northwest direction of the station, landing north of the Suzhou River, killing two innocent people and injuring many others.

### Reuters Reporter Describes Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Participation in Military Affairs

Truly an Innovation in the History of China's New Era

Central News Agency, this city, Reuters reports that a Reuters reporter has recently returned from the capital and claims that it is truly an innovation in the history of China's new era for a woman to participate in military conferences of army staff. The person is Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the wife of Chairman Chiang. The Madame sits around a table with the Chairman's military advisors, discussing air combat and air defense affairs. Madame personally observes every enemy aircraft attack on the capital, unafraid of danger. After the enemy aircraft leave, she personally visits various places to investigate the losses. The Chairman is the chairman of the Aviation Commission, and the Madame is the secretary of the commission. The Reuters reporter was led into her office, which is where the Madame works from dawn until midnight. The interior is simply furnished, with only a few ordinary desks. The Madame often uses a portable typewriter to write. A painting of Jesus hangs on the side of the desk, and a can of chocolate candy is placed on the desk. Two machine guns are placed in the corner of the room, which were recently used to shoot down Japanese aircraft in the capital. The capital has a wartime laboratory managed by the Madame. All war remnants, such as destroyed Japanese aircraft, are inspected by the Madame and experts. The Madame has been involved in reorganizing China's aviation industry for a year. When the first meeting was in progress, the news of the Chairman's Xi'an Incident came suddenly. After the Chairman escaped danger, the Madame completed the reorganization work. In this Sino-Japanese War, all administrative work related to aviation issues is handled by the Madame herself, assisted by several secretaries. None of the secretaries are women. The Madame attends all army and air force strategy meetings. In addition to administrative and technical responsibilities, the Madame also closely cares about the air force personnel, visiting the airfields from time to time, personally inspecting the equipment of the pilots and their daily lives, and even taking care of their meals. She readily accepts any suggestions from the pilots. When the Chairman receives foreign guests, the Madame often acts as an interpreter and drafts correspondence with foreign governments. The Madame graduated from Wellesley College in the United States, so she speaks fluent English and is good at writing. The Madame still guides the New Life Movement in her spare time and cares about the lives of displaced people. The Madame pays attention to world affairs and reads all Reuters telegrams received in the capital. The Madame and the Chairman live a simple life and pray for half an hour every morning and evening. In her spare time, the Madame likes to read newspapers and magazines, especially those published in English and American about women, family, and humanitarianism. According to a close friend of the Madame, the Madame has a great spirit of fearlessness. When British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked by Japanese aircraft on the Nanjing-Shanghai Highway, the Madame and the Chairman were in a war zone far from Nanjing. It is rumored that the Japanese aircraft must have mistaken Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's car for the one carrying the Chairman and the Madame. It is said that the Chairman and the Madame are willing to die under the Chinese flag in the war and are determined not to travel under the protection of a foreign flag.

### Japanese Nationals in Qingdao and Warships Will Be Completely Withdrawn

Approximately in Five Days

[Qingdao] All Japanese nationals residing in Qingdao, including consulate personnel and warships, have been ordered by Tokyo to withdraw from Qingdao. The withdrawal will be completed around September 5th. The assets of the Japanese nationals here, including the power plant, are valued at 30 million yuan, which will be transferred to the Chinese authorities for safekeeping (Central News Agency telegram, 31st).

[Qingdao] The Japanese ship Nikko Maru sailed to Moji at 9:00 AM on the 31st, carrying 605 Japanese men, 13 women, and 17 children. The Dalian Maru sailed to Dalian at noon, carrying 506 Japanese men, 2 women, 10 children, and 136 Koreans, including 20 Japanese police officers. The two ships carried a total of 1,289 Japanese nationals (Central News Agency telegram, 31st).

Since our army has resisted the enemy, it has fought bloodily and won victories step by step. The Central Government has specially sent Central Committee members Gan Naikang and Mao Zuquan to慰勞 the anti-Japanese soldiers

### Interview with Commander Yang by Two Foreign Newspaper Reporters

Determined to Eliminate Traitors. Confident in Victory Because of the Entire Nation

(Central News Agency) Shanghai Garrison Commander Yang Hushi yesterday met with reporters from the Continental and North China Daily News, explaining the duties of the garrison and the war situation of our army in detail. The following is a summary:

Responsibilities of the Garrison

The garrison was established to meet the needs of the rear during wartime. The responsibilities of the garrison are to stabilize the rear. Stabilizing the rear can help the front. The main means of stabilizing the rear are: first, to eliminate traitors; second, to stabilize local order; and third, to guide various social groups to adapt to the necessary state of wartime. Among them, I am particularly determined to eliminate traitors. However, this requires the assistance of the concession police authorities. I believe that the concession police authorities will be able to provide us with assistance, because the various criminal acts of traitors, although aimed at disrupting the operations of the Chinese army and disrupting local security in China, are based in the concession area, which inevitably affects the order and security of the concession. Therefore, the concession police authorities assisting the garrison in eliminating traitors is equivalent to eliminating the source of harm to order and security in the concession itself. The concession authorities should be happy to do so. In addition, regarding the safety of Western residents in the area of extraterritorial roads, I have already paid attention and am now trying to provide effective guarantees.

War Situation

In this Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese side is fundamentally a warlike act of aggression with wild ambitions, while the Chinese side is a war of resistance for national survival. Therefore, regarding the war situation on both sides, the enemy's propaganda is an organized exaggeration and insult. The Chinese side only cares about resisting with strength and is unwilling to do much propaganda. Because of this relationship, there are some misunderstandings in international news. I hope that international news will pay attention to this. As for the current war situation on each front, we don't need to analyze it from all aspects of the front line. As long as we talk about Luodian, which the other side considers a successful major operation, the approximately one division that initially landed is now left with remnants, which is only a struggle of time. The same is true for the seaports in other areas such as Wusong. No matter how the other side uses the navy's guerrilla warfare, if the army wants to land, it will eventually face the same fate as Luodian: annihilation. As for if someone asks us why the Chinese army has this confidence, then we can answer that it is based on the spirit of the entire nation's war of resistance, the flexible use of troops, and the determination of our leader.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Realization of Capital Revival

— Liu

The Shanghai financial market, since the Ministry of Finance promulgated measures to stabilize finance and resumed operations, has stemmed the tide of capital flight. Recently, it is planned that the four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, will establish joint discounting committees in twelve cities including Hankou and Chongqing. It is expected that the domestic market will regain activity, and agricultural and industrial production will not lack funds. Those who attempt to destroy our economic structure and create disturbances everywhere, plunging us into a state of commercial and industrial stagnation, will be thwarted. Our connected network and the internal flow of capital will allow for smooth turnover and uninterrupted production. We need not worry about the war extending into the spring or autumn of next year, or even a ten-year war.

However, it seems that divisions and boundaries still exist among various industries. As a result, circulation remains slow and inactive. This is due in part to overly strict restrictions and in part to uneven distribution of resources. The large-scale escape of capital from Shanghai occurred long before the outbreak of hostilities. The eagerness for foreign exchange at that time can easily be proven by the frequent fluctuations in exchange rates. The deposits withdrawn before the outbreak of the war were mostly used for living expenses by small households. However, if appropriate measures had not been taken at that time, a crisis could easily have been triggered amid public panic. Now, half a month has passed since the outbreak of the war. The business community's fear of war has transformed into a coping strategy adapted to the wartime environment, without the previous sense of panic. As psychology has changed, so has the environment. Therefore, it seems necessary to revise financial adjustment methods based on reality.

Enemy planes have been bombing towns and cities lacking military installations for days. They know full well that this is against international law, but they brazenly persist in creating a sense of terror, hoping to shut down our domestic commerce and industry, halt production, and trap us in their designs. However, the recent stagnation of industry and commerce in various places is not entirely due to fear of enemy aircraft attacks. It is largely due to the impact of the war in Shanghai, which has forced businesses to pause and wait. Now that the four banks are establishing joint discounting committees in the interior, financial solutions are in place, and other problems will naturally be easily resolved. Even the stagnation of foreign trade due to the fighting in coastal ports is not a major concern. After all, our country has not yet transitioned out of the agricultural economy. If foreign goods cannot come in, not only can we reduce consumption, but capital will naturally flow inward, enriching the people and strengthening the nation. This is precisely what we have been seeking but could not obtain in peacetime. However, domestic industries and businesses should also slightly change their old ideas. Just as factories and businesses that were once concentrated in one place can now be completely destroyed in an instant by aircraft and bombs, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they should be dispersed to inland towns and villages in the future. If they are not concentrated in one area, how can the enemy wantonly destroy everything?

However, further study should be given to how to bring the escaped capital back into the market. The escape of capital is driven by two factors: ㊀ purchasing and storing foreign exchange and ㊁ hiding it. Both are caused by fear and doubt. Therefore, dispelling fear and doubt will naturally attract capital back. With ample resources for turnover, industry and commerce can return to their normal state. The path to this is obvious. Now that import and export trade has stopped, exchange rates have returned to normal. However, the circulation of bills is still hampered by unnecessary complications in transfers. Restrictions on withdrawals, though intended to prevent capital flight, may strengthen the resolve of those who seek to escape. Therefore, it is important to ensure the smooth operation of bills and to encourage the return of purchased or hidden capital to the banks. This is not only related to financial turnover but also to the prosperity of the entire market. Furthermore, the pawnshop industry, as a "last resort for the poor," is suffering from a lack of cash. Pawnshops are either only accepting redemptions or, even if they remain open, are shortening their hours or lowering their valuations. This has a close relationship with the livelihood of the poor and social security. Therefore, close attention should be paid to cash withdrawals, evaluating their intended use, examining their circumstances, and rigorously auditing them to take appropriate measures. If there is a potential for capital flight, strict penalties should be imposed. As all industries are still in a state of suspension, finance is the lifeblood. It is necessary to adjust policies and measures in response to changing circumstances.

### Fierce Fighting Continues on the Jinpu Railway Line, Our Army Recaptures Jinghai County

Fierce battles with the enemy northwest of Machang　Both sides are in a stalemate at Tangguantun　Enemy forces surround Liangxiang on three sides

[Nanjing] News from transportation circles indicates that fierce fighting continues on the Jinpu Railway Line. Several Japanese military trucks transported a large number of wounded Japanese soldiers from Jinghai County to Tianjin on one day. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st)

Local news: Li Guang'an, the director of the 29th Army's Shanghai office, received a telegram from Wei Shuxiang, the Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Government, reporting on the war situation on various fronts. The original telegram is transcribed below (abbreviations omitted): Received your telegram of the 30th. Jinghai County has been recaptured on the Jinpu Railway Line. The security team has returned to the city. The county magistrate is still working in Tangguantun. Sixteen enemy planes arrived in Cangxian on the 30th, dropping more than ninety bombs, destroying many houses, and causing more than a hundred casualties. No changes on the Pinghan Railway Line.

[Jinan] In the Jinpu Railway Line battle, the enemy forces have not yet crossed the west side of the Grand Canal. Duliu Town is still garrisoned by our army. A unit of our left wing has reached the Xiaozhan area, and guerrillas appear from time to time, causing the enemy forces to be exhausted. At Huifeng Bridge on the Jinyan Highway northeast of Tangguantun, the enemy forces, guided by bandits, are launching fierce attacks. However, our army is fully prepared, and although the enemy is stubborn, it will be difficult for them to succeed. There have been fierce battles for several days. On the frontal side, both sides are in a stalemate at Tangguantun. A reporter met with a military commander in Cangzhou on the 30th, who expressed great optimism about this resistance war and said that for the sake of national survival, even if only one person and one bullet remain, they will fight the enemy. He also said that this resistance war has a front line that stretches for thousands of miles, and the loss or gain of a single county or town in the front is not worth emphasizing. Only the final outcome matters. A unit has now been fully deployed to the Jinpu Railway Line to join the fighting. It is expected that there will be great progress in the Jinpu area. The people's militia in various parts of Hebei Province have provided much assistance to the army in this battle, often surprising the enemy, using indigenous cannons and rifles to attack the enemy, with remarkable results. A tank was captured from the enemy in Tangguantun a few days ago, and many Japanese soldiers were killed, which shows that the people of our country have the same determination to resist the war as the government. The victory of the resistance war can be predicted. On the afternoon of the 30th, fifteen enemy planes went to Cangzhou to bomb, dropping more than a hundred bombs in the city and along the Grand Canal, and strafing with machine guns, injuring eighty or ninety innocent civilians and killing more than thirty mules and horses.

### US Policy Unlikely to Change in Response to Far East Situation

Promoting Peace and Protecting Interests in China　Actively Seeking Contact with Britain and France

⊙Hyde Park　President Roosevelt was heard to have had three telephone calls with Washington in one day. The US government's position on the Far East has changed dramatically within 24 hours. (National Telegram on the 31st)

[London] The US attitude towards the Far East situation is worth noting. According to a report from the Washington correspondent of the Morning Post, isolationists have not yet been able to achieve their goal of declaring neutrality, and the authorities are moving towards active cooperation with Britain and France. According to the correspondent's opinion, even if the Neutrality Act is enacted now, it will not change the general impression of US policy. The United States will continue to cooperate with other countries to maintain peace in China and protect its interests in the Far East. Furthermore, well-informed sources in London said that if the United States is willing to take more active actions this time to put pressure on Japan, Britain and France will immediately respond and cooperate. However, there is no indication of this so far. Japan's financial weakness and its reliance on imported raw materials are highly valued here.

### Japan Delays Reply to British Note

When asked whether there were concerns about the occurrence of incidents like the Shanghai Incident after the evacuation of Japanese overseas Chinese from Qingdao, he replied that it was similar to the evacuation from Hankou.

The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has absolutely denied it, believing that this news is completely fabricated and that the dissemination of this news is merely intended to provide a frivolous tool for the forces creating a European war.

### English Newspapers Praise Our Resistance Against Japan

China's Status Elevated; Ultimate Victory Inevitable

[London] Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, the diplomatic correspondent of the London Times wrote a commentary today, stating that if China had not risen up to resist Japan's invasion, the country would have faced disintegration and lost its national character, leading to a perilous future. "Now that it has risen to deal with Japan, its international status has risen to a height not seen in many years. If Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek can make good use of his military power in the future, ensuring China does not suffer a crushing defeat, then given China's vast territory, it can certainly sustain the war for a long time." As for Japan's strategy, the correspondent continued, the actions of the Japanese army in Shanghai today clearly indicate an intention to create an iron ring around Shanghai to prevent Chinese troops from re-entering after being driven out. In other words, Japan is attempting to re-enact the old drama of 1932 to consolidate its gains in Shanghai and concentrate its main force to advance south from North China. The correspondent then discussed the economic aspects of the Japanese military campaign, stating that North China is a source of various inexpensive minerals and raw materials. Therefore, the economic aspect is the main justification for the Japanese army's invasion of China. They aim to use force as a prelude to economic invasion, develop new sources of wealth, and utilize German-style import controls to support the domestic economy. This, he said, is the reason why the business community supports the invasion. The correspondent concluded by saying that these military-industrial figures can be considered the middle ground in Japan, with the warlords who control the overall situation on one side and ordinary industrialists and merchants on the other. They believe that peaceful aggression can achieve great profits with small expenditures. The latter group is now expanding significantly, but unfortunately, too slowly to change the warlords' original intentions. In the past year, Japan has reduced its foreign debt, and in the London market, where 70% of its foreign trade finance revolves, Japan's credit remains stable. However, domestically, it deeply feels the difficulty of paying for massive military expenditures. Furthermore, there is a shortage of raw materials and machinery needed for industrial development, as well as a shortage of skilled workers and a continuing rise in general prices, making its plight even worse. While a revaluation of the yen was possible in 1932 when world prices were low, reducing the value of the yen today would block the inflow of various much-needed imports, preventing Japan from procuring sufficient essential items from abroad, such as kerosene from the United States and the East Indies, which are indispensable for Japan.

### Japanese Aggression Threatens France, Feeling

"Evening News" Publishes Article

[Paris] The extreme left-wing newspaper "Evening News" has published several articles by "狄伏才拉" for several days, discussing the Far East situation. Today's article is the last, stating briefly, "If Japan wins against China, it will become a threat to France, and our country's Far East territories will also be in imminent danger. Japan has been meticulously planning to expand its aggression beyond China for quite some time. In recent years, it has been planning to dig the Kra Canal in Siam to connect the Pacific and Indian Oceans and threaten India, which is one example. However, the country most threatened by Japan is Vietnam. If Japan controls China, it will be easy to nibble away at Vietnam. Japan has already begun preparing for the future, as there is an island facing Vietnam's Tonkin across the sea, south of British Hong Kong. This island is Hainan Island, which belongs to Guangdong Province in China. This island is a strategic location with winding harbors that can be used as a submarine base. It is only a few hours from the island to Vietnam. Japan has long coveted this island. Therefore, France should now cooperate with Britain and the United States and adopt a firm attitude towards Japan." (Central News Agency, 1st dispatch from Havas)

### Japanese Troops Massacre Innocents

American Newspaper Condemns Sternly

[Washington] An editorial in the Washington Daily News on the 21st strongly condemned Japan's massacre of innocent people and disregard for humanity, using unusually harsh language. It stated that the focus of Britain's strong protest to Japan is the Japanese army's wanton massacre of innocent people, as exemplified by the recent indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Shanghai's Nanshi and the Beijing-Hangzhou area. The injury to the British ambassador is only one aspect. Such behavior, which disregards humanity and violates international law, is a symbol of barbarism and cruelty. Yet Japan still considers itself among civilized nations, making it a laughingstock to the world. Such illegal and inhumane behavior is tantamount to a suicidal policy, because when Japan itself is bombed in the future, it will see that what it does not want done to itself, others will do to it.

### Yu Fu River, a Tributary of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, Floods Jinan

Villages from North of the City to Luokou Are Gone The River Defense Bureau Actively Works to Close the Breach

Jinan Correspondence On the 12th of this month, the Yu Fu River, a tributary of the Yellow River, breached its banks in Changqing.

### British Merchants Resume Navigation of North and South Ocean Routes

Swire Sends Seven Ships, Jardine Matheson Sends Four Ships Operate to Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin, Swatow, Hong Kong, and Canton

After the outbreak of the August 13th battle, Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai all sent their North and South Ocean vessels to Hong Kong. Within the Yangtze River line, navigation initially continued to the Jinghan section, but after the 16th, it was also announced to be suspended. Ships were concentrated in Hankou, and all traffic on the Jianghai routes was completely cut off. On the 26th of last month, Japan announced the blockade of the Chinese coast. British merchant ships in Shanghai, such as Swire and Jardine Matheson, upon Japanese claims that there were no obstacles for third-country vessels, cabled to Hong Kong, discussing resuming

Coastal Navigation of North and South Ocean Routes

As a result of the consultation, Swire dispatched the Shengjing, Shuntian, and Yuezhou, three ships, to operate on the Shanghai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Tianjin line. The Shengjing sailed north for the first time yesterday, carrying 229 boxes of tea from Shanghai. This is the first batch of goods transported north after the war. The Shuntian is scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 7th. Four ships, Jinan, Niuzhuang, Guangzhou, and Sichuan, have been assigned to the South China line. Starting tomorrow, the Jinan will begin sailing to Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Canton, roughly twice a week. Jardine Matheson's first ship, Lisheng, will

Sail to Swatow, Hong Kong, and Canton

Starting tomorrow. Ship Dingsheng will continue to sail on the 3rd, also to South China. Ship Fusheng will sail on the 4th, bound for Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, and Tianjin in the North Ocean. Ship Zesheng will sail on the 7th, bound for South China. Afterwards, the number of ships will be increased depending on business needs. Currently, the two companies have dispatched a total of eleven ocean-going vessels to maintain navigation on the North and South Ocean routes, with four ships temporarily operating on the North Ocean and seven ships sailing on the South Ocean. However, during this wartime period, all freight charges and water fees must be paid in cash and will be moderately increased.

According to the Shipping Industry

The South Ocean route mainly involves cargo for import, the most important of which is the supply of daily necessities for foreigners in Shanghai. Exports mainly involve passengers. As for the North Ocean route, there are tens of thousands of people waiting for ships to go south from Tianjin, and even more transferring to other transportation in Yantai and other places. A reporter asked a foreign merchant whether the Japanese navy, having announced the blockade of our coastline, might inspect British ships. The reply was that since Britain is not involved in the war and merchant ships are engaged in peaceful business, any third-country ships would be unwilling to be inspected. Moreover, British warships are stationed in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Liu Gong Island. Under these special circumstances, the navigation of British ships will certainly be protected at all times.

### Traitorous Merchants Should Be Punished For Supplying Beef to the Enemy

Transporting Beef to Enemy Cold Storage Every Night Transporting A Large Quantity of Lian Xianzheng Each Time

Currently, traitorous merchants have been discovered in the city supplying beef to the enemy. To avoid public attention, a certain slaughterhouse first slaughters the cattle, then transports them to a certain beef shop. Then, the enemy sends trucks to pick them up during the nighttime curfew and stores them in the enemy's cold storage on Miller Road. Many have been transported in recent days. It is reported that Zhang Mujin, Fei Shaojin, Hu Xiaolong, Zhang Fujin, Gong Jiaqi, Tang Xianghe, and others in the cattle business were entrusted by Japanese individuals such as Mikasaya Shimizu to purchase large quantities of beef at high prices after the Lugouqiao Incident, up to hundreds of heads per day. The beef currently eaten by the enemy in Shanghai is the cattle supplied and stored by Zhang Mujin and others. The authorities are currently investigating this strictly.

### The Cilian Association Telegraphed to Request an Initial Allocation of 100,000 to Relieve Refugees

The Refugee Relief Committee of the United Relief Association of Various Charitable Organizations stated that from the outbreak of the war to the present, in addition to those who have been sent away, there are still over 10,000 refugees being sheltered. The need for funds is urgent, and while people from all walks of life have generously donated, it is still far from sufficient. Moreover, as the war prolongs, more refugees will inevitably arrive, and it will be impossible to provide relief without large sums of money. Therefore, the vice chairmen of the association, Qu Wenliu, Wang Yiting, and Huang Manzhi, telegraphed Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the Relief Commission, requesting an initial allocation of 100,000 yuan to meet immediate needs.

In addition to the Bank of China itself taking on 10 million yuan, it also took on the task of soliciting subscriptions from organizations such as the Construction Bank, Guangdong Bank, and China Insurance Company, totaling 20 million yuan. The breakdown is as follows: Bank of China 10 million yuan, Construction Bank 3 million yuan, Guangdong Bank 1 million yuan, China Insurance Company 1.5 million yuan, China Cotton Corporation 2 million yuan, Huainan Coal Mining Company 750,000 yuan, Yangtze Electric Company 750,000 yuan, South China Rice Corporation 500,000 yuan, Hankou Jiji Water and Electricity Company 250,000 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company 250,000 yuan, totaling 20 million yuan.

Bank of China Colleagues

The Bank of China colleagues have also taken the initiative to organize and formulate methods for soliciting subscriptions from colleagues. Except for those with lower salaries, who can exercise discretion, all other colleagues are required to donate at least one month's salary, with larger donations welcome. Some have even transferred all of their usual savings to purchase National Salvation Bonds. As of recently, colleagues at the headquarters alone have donated 140,000 yuan. It is reported that Chairman Song Ziwen subscribed to 50,000 yuan, General Manager Song Hanzhang 21,000 yuan, Feng Youwei 10,500 yuan, Wang Baolun 2,500 yuan, Wang Lengbo 10,700 yuan, Dai Zhiqian 1,500 yuan, Huo Yamin 1,400 yuan, Wang Zihong 1,500 yuan, Xia Pingfang 1,000 yuan, and Bian Fusun 1,000 yuan. The names of other colleagues cannot be listed in full and will be reported later. It is expected that the amount of donations from colleagues at other branches will arrive gradually, and the amount should be even more impressive.

### National Salvation Bonds Shanghai Solicitation

The Shanghai Municipal Team of the Solicitation Committee Holds Meeting

The Local Association is Hired to Serve as the Head of the Team Hope That the Gentry and the Wealthy and Foreign Currency Depositors Will Strive to Contribute

The Shanghai Local Association was hired by the General Assembly of the National Salvation Bonds Solicitation Committee to serve as the Shanghai Municipal Citizen Solicitation Team. A meeting was held yesterday, attended by Team Leader Du Yuesheng, Deputy Team Leaders Qian Xinzhi and Wang Xiaolai, Honorary Team Leader Yu Qiaqing, and the heads of various groups, totaling over fifty people. Team Leader Du presided over the meeting and gave a speech, stating that since Japan's invasion of Jicha, Songhu has suffered damage. The government, in order to consolidate national defense and protect the people, has issued 500 million yuan in National Salvation Bonds to finance national defense military expenditures. All of you are social leaders with ardent patriotism and will certainly do your best to solicit subscriptions, concentrate people's wealth, and strengthen combat power. The survival of the nation depends on this one move. I sincerely hope that you will redouble your efforts to help fulfill the national duty. Then, the team's articles of association were approved (the articles are recorded later). It was resolved to ask each group to quickly establish sub-teams to widely solicit subscriptions from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, with particular emphasis on the gentry and the wealthy and those with foreign currency deposits, in order to easily accumulate large amounts. It is also hoped that citizens of this city who know the names, addresses, and property amounts of the gentry and the wealthy, or the amounts of foreign currency held, will provide detailed listings without needing to provide their names, and send them to the Shanghai Citizen Solicitation Team of the Local Association, so that subscriptions can be solicited. It is heard that some members of the gentry and the wealthy in this city have already reported their subscription amounts to the team, which is a sign of public spirit. The team should publicize this as an encouragement.

### Factory Investigation During Emergency Period

Organized by the Social Affairs Bureau

Since the outbreak of the war in this city, many factories have been forced to shut down because their factory sites have become war zones, their sources of raw materials have been cut off, or their capital turnover is sluggish. At the beginning of this resistance war, rear production is extremely important. In order to understand the situation of factories during this emergency period, the Social Affairs Bureau of this city has specially prepared an investigation form, printed and prepared by the Shen Bao. The bureau has instructed various domestic goods factory associations to notify all factories in this city, regardless of whether they were previously registered or are currently closed, to fill out the form in detail according to the format from now until September 10th and send it to Mr. Xiang Zhuanggu, 4 Weida Lane, Lafayette Road, Second Special Zone (requests by mail are also accepted).

### French Concession Restricts Newspaper Vendors

Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, the French Concession authorities have adopted various measures to prevent the publication of inaccurate news in this city that would disrupt order within the concession. Only major newspapers are allowed to circulate in the French Concession, and various small newspapers with inconsistent sources of information have been temporarily banned from sale. Now, because there are too many newspaper vendors on various roads shouting loudly, which is detrimental to public safety, the following regulations for restricting newspaper sales are specified: Newspaper vendors who sell newspapers in the French Concession must register with the French Concession Police Department and obtain a badge authorizing them to sell newspapers before they are allowed to sell. The badges will be numbered and stamped by the French Concession Police Department. The number of approved vendors is 220. However, these newspaper vendors are still not allowed to shout loudly, but are only allowed to call out the name of the newspaper, and they are not allowed to solicit sales on various public transportation vehicles, which would obstruct traffic. If the above regulations are violated, the offending newspaper vendor will be taken to the police station, and the badge will be confiscated. As for the newspaper couriers employed by newspaper offices to deliver newspapers to subscribers by car, they are not subject to the above restrictions.

### Local Organizations Suggest Issuing Token Vouchers

Lake Society Petitions for Issuance of National Circulation Vouchers; Silk Industry Association Requests Shanghai Commercial Vouchers

The Lake Society of this city, considering that since the outbreak of the war, finances have dried up and all industries have stalled, and if no measures are taken to provide relief, the rear may collapse, has specially petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government to request the central government to issue circulation vouchers. The main points of the original petition are excerpted below: ㊀ Circulation vouchers can alleviate the shortage of banknotes and are specifically for domestic circulation, differing in nature from formal banknotes, but can still resist foreign exchange. Banknotes must have reserve funds, while circulation vouchers use goods as reserves, to be issued by the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank. ㊁ Most state-run industrial and commercial operators in our country do not have sufficient capital, and rely on loans from special banks and money shops for support. Now, with the shortage of legal tender and financial stagnation, those with savings cannot withdraw them, let alone borrow, which will leave the industrial and commercial sectors with goods they cannot sell and raw materials they cannot use. After the issuance of circulation vouchers, the industrial and commercial sectors can mortgage goods at appraised values, with low interest rates and long terms, allowing factories and businesses to prepare leisurely and operate to the fullest extent, with some hope of revival. (Three) With the outbreak of war, industry and commerce have shut down, and the number of unemployed is no less than tens of millions. The strong become bandits, and the old and weak end up in ditches. How can the order of the rear be maintained? After the issuance of circulation vouchers, finance will circulate, industry and commerce will revive, the unemployed will be relieved, and society will be stabilized. ㊃ Circulation vouchers are fully used and valid nationwide, regardless of provincial boundaries, but cannot be exchanged for legal tender. Denominations include one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, and one hundred yuan. Movable and immovable property and all goods accepted as collateral will serve as reserves for the vouchers. Mortgaged items will be publicly appraised at market prices and fully collateralized. The term is tentatively set at one to five years, with an annual interest rate of four percent. A review committee will be formed to inspect the items, appraise their market prices, and a custody committee will be formed to safeguard the goods.

The Shanghai Silk Industry Association yesterday drafted key measures for issuing wartime Shanghai commercial vouchers and sent them to the two city chambers of commerce, requesting them to suggest the following measures to the authorities: ㊀ These commercial vouchers are purely issued by the Shanghai business community to cope with the wartime shortage of legal tender for market circulation. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce should draft detailed methods, submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and the city chamber of commerce should jointly prepare a reserve with the money shops to be responsible for issuance. ㊁ These commercial vouchers will be in denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. ㊂ These commercial vouchers will circulate in the market, regardless of the duration, without interest. ㊃ Method of use: Stores and firms that use the vouchers must prepare reliable guarantees. After applying to the joint reserve of money shops and obtaining agreement, they may sign a usage contract, and an anti-counterfeiting mark must be stamped on the voucher before it can be used. ㊄ These commercial vouchers are limited to circulation in Shanghai and are fully usable in the same way as legal tender. ㊅ User states should prepare the same number of commercial vouchers or legal tender within six months of use to return the guarantees to the issuing agency. ㊆ These commercial vouchers may not be exchanged for legal tender or other auxiliary currencies from the issuing agency, but self-exchange in the market is not subject to this rule.

### Propagating the National Crisis

Thunder and Lightning Theater Troupe Departs for South China; Snow Society Broadcasts National Defense Dramas

The Zhabei Thunder and Lightning Theater Troupe of this city, since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, has seen its members scattered and all troupe affairs have come to a standstill. Recently, the person in charge of the troupe, Ma Ling, considering the severity of the national crisis and the commencement of the full-scale war of resistance, and the importance of drama in propaganda, gathered more than ten theater people of conscience in Shanghai, including Song An, Lin Fei, Chen Kangran, and Zhu Banren, to reorganize and continue the theatrical movement, and deliberately renamed it the Thunder and Lightning Theater Team. They plan to depart for various places in the South in the coming days to propagate the national crisis and organize the people to resist the enemy for a long time and achieve final victory. It is reported that the team's office is currently temporarily located at 162 Foch Road in the French Concession. The Snow Society in this city is engaged in rescue work in a rather intense manner. In addition to organizing a wartime service group and a comfort team, the drama department will broadcast national defense dramas such as 'Our Hometown,' 'The Night Before,' and 'Roaring Hebei' from 2:00 pm every day starting on the 4th of this month, from the China and Overseas Radio Station (1260 kHz), to carry out salvation propaganda. The Literature and Art Department also began publishing the 'Cold Friend Extraordinary Bi-monthly' from the 6th, with rich content, beautiful style, and novel themes, with particular emphasis on anti-war comics. It is reported that each issue sells for only two French cents.

### Overseas Students Studying in the U.S. Surely Expect to Depart

More than two hundred students studying in the United States in this class, previously due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all foreign ships competed to transport foreigners away from Shanghai, causing the students studying in the United States to temporarily postpone their departure. Subsequently, after proper negotiations between the student representatives and the Ta Lai Company, it was decided to take the President Hoover and President McKinley, which sailed to Shanghai on the 30th and 31st of last month, to the United States. When the President Hoover arrived at the mouth of the Songjiang River, it was accidentally bombed, causing the ship to sail directly to Japan and return to the United States. The President McKinley also did not stop when it passed through Shanghai before, causing the departure of the students studying in the United States to be postponed again. Considering this, the students studying in the United States again dispatched representatives to contact the Changxing Shipping Company, requesting that the company's Empress of Canada ship carry them to the United States when it arrives in Shanghai on the 5th of this month. It is now heard that the representative responsible for the negotiations is scheduled to report on the negotiation process and other important matters at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 10:00 am tomorrow. It is hoped that all students studying in the United States will attend on time.

### City Federation Wartime Service Council Held Fourth Meeting Yesterday

The Citizen Federation of the First Special District of this city held its fourth Wartime Service Committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Zhang Yichen. The matters resolved were: ㊀ The Federation now plans to first organize the patrol teams on Nanjing Road and other fourteen roads to maintain order, and scheduled a discussion meeting with the responsible persons of the sub-districts on the afternoon of September 3rd at 2:00 pm to plan everything. ㊁ The Federation advocated using national salvation bonds to pay rent. In addition to writing to the Real Estate Association, it should also immediately instruct the sub-districts to earnestly persuade tenants. ㊂ Committee member Wang Zhaocheng proposed that those who purchase national salvation bonds in amounts of more than ten thousand yuan should be rewarded by the General Association in accordance with separate regulations to show encouragement.

### Wang Xiaolai Proposes to Stop the Opening of Entertainment Venues

Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai yesterday proposed to the Anti-Enemy Support Association to stop the opening of entertainment venues. The original text states: "It has been found that many entertainment venues are enthusiastically serving as refugee shelters. Recently, it has been reported that dance halls are raising funds in name only, and some are even opening, which is truly being blinded by greed and shows no conscience. A group of dancers are even more frantic and stupid as cold-blooded animals. They should be strictly ordered to stop, and instead be held responsible for running hospitals or refugee shelters. If they refuse, they should be punished." Today, the military representatives of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang United Office all expressed their indignation and were very vehement. There are also reports that donations to the Support Association and local associations were not approved in advance, which constitutes fraudulent behavior and should be questioned in a special letter and dealt with accordingly, without leniency.

### Refugees from Danger in Hongkou Provided with Shelter in Reception Centers

Yesterday afternoon, the City Relief Committee rescued approximately 2,000 refugees from danger in Hongkou. Yesterday morning, more than 200 people were rescued, and the committee added nine reception centers to house them separately. The five reception centers are: ㊀ Daguanlou (Shilu) ㊁ Ya Lou (Sima Road), Quanminle (near Father Bisi Road) ㊃ Hongyunlou (Avenue Edward VII), ㊄ Yiyuan (opposite the Far East at the Racecourse).

### There is No Interruption in the Water Supply in the Concession

Everything is Normal Now; Residents Can Rest Assured

Recently, due to the impact of the war, floating corpses have been found in the Huangpu River from time to time. Residents are deeply concerned about the turbidity of the tap water. However, according to the report of the Chief of the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau, the supply of tap water is as usual, and residents can rest assured. The office said that since the change of the situation, the quality of tap water has always maintained its usual high standard, and cases of residents suffering from gastrointestinal diseases are quite rare. This shows that the tap water company's clarification pond has not been affected, and its function is still as usual. Eighteen days have passed since the outbreak of the Shanghai War. During this period, the tap water required by users has been supplied continuously, and its pressure and quality have not changed. Although the machinery used by the tap water company has been damaged occasionally, it is insignificant. The water pipes in various places have been repaired on time, and the Public Works Bureau has decided on emergency supply measures in order to be cautious, so that users can still have a source of water in case the water source is affected. But in fact, there is no possibility of the water source being cut off.

### There is No Need to Worry About the Fuel Supply; Coal Briquette Factories Will Start Work Immediately

The Regulated Price is $1.60 Per Load

Since the outbreak of the war, the coal briquette manufacturing factories, which are the main fuel for Shanghai residents, are located on the front lines, resulting in a lack of supply and causing great panic. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has separately ordered six factories, including Zhonghua, to start work immediately and continue manufacturing to meet the needs, and has restricted the price to $1.60 per load as the standard to meet the needs of residents. The bureau issued a notice yesterday, which stated, "It has been found that coal briquettes are a daily necessity for residents. Since the war, the manufacturers have all suspended operations, interrupting production, which is not appropriate. The Bureau has considered the local production and sales situation and has ordered factories such as Zhonghua Factory, Nanyang Factory, Hezhong Factory, Guohua Factory, Dongfang Factory, and Huanan Factory to start work as soon as possible and continue manufacturing to meet the needs of the people. The price per load is $1.60 as the standard. In addition to ordering the industry association to comply with it, the Municipal Police Bureau is also instructed to protect it properly."

### Aviation Lottery Prizes Will Still Be Paid Out as Usual

The Aviation Highway Construction Lottery has been issued for 38 periods since its inception. Because of its reliable credit, it has been popular with the public. Recently, since the Shanghai War, a few people have questioned whether the winning tickets can be redeemed as scheduled. A reporter from the newspaper went to the office to inquire in order to understand the truth. According to the person in charge, the prize money for each period has always been deposited in the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Communications Bank before the redemption, and has never been changed. It should be known that the construction lottery is founded by the state and has a long-standing reputation. No matter what the situation, the redemption procedure will be handled in accordance with the usual practice and will never be changed due to the war. The reporter then inquired with the three banks and learned that the banks are currently paying out prizes as usual, and confirmed that the statements made by the office spokesperson are indeed true. Those in society who have doubts about this lottery can now rest assured.

### Minhang District Chief Arrested

Wu Shilao, the chief of the Minhang District Office in Shanghai County, was summoned and detained by the county government yesterday morning, and was sent to the Songjiang Commissioner's Office for interrogation on the same day. As for the reason for the arrest, it is said that in this extremely tense period, Wu failed to maintain local order and was absent from the county government meeting, so it was suspected that he had deserted in the face of the enemy.

### Fire at Datongmen in Nanshi Yesterday Afternoon

At about 1:10 pm yesterday afternoon, the skylight awning in front of Heyuan Nanhuo Store at No. 180 Zhonghua Road, at the intersection of Xianzhua Street outside Datongmen in Nanshi, suddenly caught fire for unknown reasons. The fire then spread to the adjacent stores on the left and right, Jichun Longan Store and Guangshengyuan Candy Store, and the fire became uncontrollable. Upon hearing the alarm, the fire brigades from various districts in Nanshi rushed to the scene and fought bravely to put out the fire. It was not until about half an hour later that the fire was extinguished.

### Song Ziwen Discusses the Use of National Salvation Bonds

Purchasing Public Bonds Strengthens the Foundation of the Country and Ensures That It Will Not Be Forced to Its Knees

Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Salvation Bonds Solicitation Committee, issued a statement yesterday, saying that recent newspapers had mistakenly reported that he had said that the national salvation bonds were entirely for national defense military use. Song Ziwen declared that this report was incorrect, because the purpose of the national salvation bonds was purely to provide general funds for the government, similar to the nature of other public bonds. At this time of extreme national crisis, all of our citizens hope to fulfill their duties to the government, and this is almost the same mentality. The government is now issuing 500 million yuan in public bonds, which are named national salvation bonds, aiming to arouse the sympathy of the people and also to provide everyone with an opportunity to serve the country. In fact, the facts tell us that it is sufficient to prove that in a country without a strong government, the lives, property, and freedom of its people are absolutely not guaranteed. Our compatriots should purchase national salvation bonds, which means jointly building a strong national foundation, ensuring that we will not be forced to our knees. Furthermore, this public bond is issued at face value, with a weekly interest rate of 4%, which is relatively low compared to the interest rates of other public bonds. However, the spirit of sacrifice of our country and nation for the general purchase will always be remembered and cannot be erased. As long as the Republic of China does not perish, the government must fulfill the obligations of this public bond.

### Traitors Dealt with According to the Law

### Foreigners Care for Our Compatriots

Donating to Help Wounded Soldiers and Refugees

### Our Troops' Position in Luodian is Consolidated; Enemy Troops in Wusong Advance on All Routes

Tongji University Bombed by the Enemy; No Trace of the Enemy in Shizilin, Baoshan

Between last night and this morning, enemy troops at Paotaiwan, Wusong Town south to Yunzaobang, Zhanghuabang and other places launched fierce attacks on our troops' positions at the cost of great sacrifices. Our troops also responded with concentrated firepower. The sounds of guns and cannons did not cease all night. The target of the enemy's naval artillery fire was concentrated in the area near Tongji University and Yanghang. After dawn this morning, more than ten enemy planes came again to bomb and assist in the battle, so Tongji University has been almost completely destroyed. Moreover, enemy troops have arrived near the school at more than 9:00 am today. Our troops are still strictly guarding the line in Yanghang. The area from Baoshan to Shizilin is still our troops' position. Although the enemy has repeatedly attacked, they have never succeeded. The enemy troops in Luodian are still surrounded by our large army. According to a war report received by a military agency this morning, ㊀ The enemy troops who landed at Qiujiang Pier yesterday (1st) attacked our Guanyintang position. After failing, they are now still retreating to their original position and dare not attack again. ㊁ In the Wusong area, after our troops launched a fierce attack last night, they have now completed a large encirclement. It is expected that hundreds of remaining enemies in the area can be completely resolved today. ㊂ In Luodian, our troops fiercely advanced from Changqiao last night, and are now two or three miles away from the river. The remaining enemy troops have lost their ability to resist, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them all in the next day or two.

### Enemy at Zhanghuabang Stubbornly Resist

Since enemy reinforcements successively landed in Wusong Town, they have attacked our Baoshan County under the cover of enemy planes and enemy ships, trying to break through the encirclement and make contact with the enemy in Luodian. Our troops were prepared early, and the enemy's repeated attacks were repelled. Now the enemy is entrenched east of the railway line in the Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, and Wusong Town areas, stubbornly resisting, and it is learned that the enemy has built a floating pier as long as one mile there, in order to continuously land troops.

### Enemy in Shanghai East Hongkou Attempt to Defend Stubbornly

Confirmed information, the enemy's defense works in Yangshupu, Broadway Road, Outer Hongqiao, Wusong Road, Haibin Road, Miller Road, Minhang Road, Dongxi Huade Road and other places, after being automatically set on fire when they were collected and retreated a few days ago, are now being arranged by their reinforcements, and because of the lack of yellow sand, there is no way to pile sandbags, so they are digging soil and gravel on the open spaces in the area to pile up. At the more important streets, iron wire currents are laid, and machine guns are set up in all the stronger buildings for defense. Seeing this, the enemy troops in the area seem to have the intention of resisting stubbornly for a long time.

Inside the Ritongxing Yarn Factory, No. 2086, Linqing Road, Yangshupu Road, the enemy is engaged in setting up another army headquarters to specifically direct its army's operations. Now the factory has been transporting a large number of munitions and food in recent days, and special guards are in place in the surrounding area.

Central News Agency said that the enemy in Yangshupu Hongkou, with the help of the army, launched a counterattack against us again from last night to this morning. The enemy ships in the river frequently bombarded with heavy artillery for cover. The artillery fire was concentrated on the Beihuo Railway Station. Our ×× artillery positions also returned fire with artillery. In Yangshupu, we densely fired with rifles and machine guns. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the enemy did not succeed. The sound of guns gradually became sparse until dawn.

### The Enemy Also Destroys Cultural Institutions

Tongji University Has Been Destroyed; Declares War on World Culture

The National Tongji University, located in Wusong, has been repeatedly reconnaissance by enemy aircraft since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, hoping to destroy it. However, in order to focus on dealing with the Zhabei war, they only added bombardment with naval guns. Until this time, when the enemy reinforcements arrived and the whole plan was to land in Wusong and other places, they concentrated artillery fire on the school in the event of a battle failure. On the 28th and 29th, they bombed all the school's buildings all day with airplanes dropping bombs. Now, almost all of them have been destroyed, especially the buildings with large earthworks such as the auditorium, the training factory, and the student dormitory. The survey and navigation museum, which has not yet been completed, has also been bombed. It has been found that the school is located far north of Wusong Town, and is not important militarily. Even our army has no actual use of the school for combat. The enemy's destruction in this way is not a planned conspiracy, who can believe it? It has been heard that since the outbreak of the war, the destruction of cultural education institutions has been the enemy's entire plan. The school has moved various mechanical instruments, books, and files to a safe area. In addition, this practical university, which has a history of several decades and is quite famous at home and abroad, has shared the same fate as Nankai University in Tianjin and Pingjin. The enemy's intentional destruction of cultural construction is tantamount to the actual combat of the entire world culture, and the vicious face is exposed more clearly.

### Enemy Ships Gather in Wusong and Liuhe

In recent days, most of the enemy ships docked in Shanghai have gathered in the Wusong and Liuhe areas, while leaving a small number of enemy ships to cruise in the Huangpu River as a cover for their rear in Hongkou and Yangshupu. At 1:10 am today, in addition to one enemy gunboat entering, two destroyers, one transport ship, and one gunboat also departed. In total, there are eleven Japanese ships moored in the river today. The distribution is as follows: One destroyer at Mitsubishi Pier 16, one destroyer at Floating Pontoon 1, one destroyer at Floating Pontoon 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, and 17, and one gunboat at Floating Pontoon 22 and 35. As for the enemy flagship Izumo, which plans the enemy's military operations, it is still berthed at Floating Pontoon 2.

### Our Troops and Enemy Ships Bombard Each Other

Public Works Bureau intelligence, yesterday (1st) night, Chinese troops near a certain place opened fire and fired at Japanese ships in the Huangpu River. Field artillery fired at Japanese ships on the side. In addition to returning fire, Japanese ships fired at Pudong and Beihuo Railway Station. The fighting with rifles and machine guns in the Yangshupu area did not stop until 3:00 am. The battle site was approximately north of the police station. At 4:30, a heavy artillery shell exploded about 300 yards behind the North Station. There were also artillery shells about one mile west of North Xizang Road. These shells appeared to have been fired from warships in the Huangpu River.

At about 6:00 am this morning, a shell fell at the intersection of Yichang Road and Gordon Road, injuring two Chinese (male). Also, there was artillery fire near Baoshan Road between 8:00 and 10:00.

The Japanese ships on the Pujiang surface east of Hongkou bombarded the Pudong area with heavy artillery again at about 3:00 am this morning, for more than seven consecutive shots.

### Our Plainclothes Team Attacks the Enemy Camp Fiercely

Operated in the North Sichuan Road Area; The Enemy Suffered Countless Casualties and Enormous Losses

According to confirmed information, at about 9:00 pm last night, our plainclothes team suddenly appeared in the North Sichuan Road area and launched a fierce attack on the enemy's rear position. The enemy was caught off guard and immediately mobilized the armored vehicle team and fired machine guns indiscriminately. Seeing that the enemy was in chaos, our plainclothes team took the opportunity to advance towards Chongming Road on Wusong Road. At this time, the enemy's position rained down with hand grenades. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and huge losses.

### Enemy Ships Transport Munitions to Shanghai Again

Since the enemy troops repeatedly attacked our riverine ports and were repeatedly defeated by our troops, they spared no effort to commit their national elite forces to re-offend our borders. In addition to the reinforcements that have arrived in Shanghai one after another, the number of which has reached three divisions, they have also transported a large number of munitions. In addition to the Jian Fa Maru, Tian Xiang Maru, and Shanghai Maru, which had already completed their exports from the previous day, yesterday there was one enemy transport ship and one merchant ship, which also set sail this morning after unloading the munitions. Today, according to the reporter's investigation, there is another enemy merchant ship (the name is painted over) docked at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. There are thirty to forty enemy troops unloading munitions, which is very busy. There are seven trucks parked at the wharf, ready to transport the munitions. In the past five days, the enemy has transported a total of seven ships of military equipment and munitions to Shanghai.

### The Seiyukai Demands That the Japanese Government Explain the Purpose of Using Troops in China

And Establish a More Active Policy, Otherwise, the People May Have No Peaceful Days

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai held a meeting today. The three leaders submitted a proposal, advocating that a detailed investigation be conducted into the government's purpose of using troops in China, and that the government's intentions be clarified. They also advocated finding a way for the government to clearly announce its purpose in China, and to establish a fundamental national policy based on its determined purpose. Otherwise, it would be difficult to have a satisfactory plan for the mobilization of troops, military operations, finance, and national economy, and the people's psychology would not have peaceful days. The above suggestions seem to have a sense of urgency, but it is said that the content is to demand that the government establish a more active policy towards China.

### The "Shengjing" Hit Outside Wusongkou

Tension in London

[London] According to a telegram from Shanghai, the British steamer "Shengjing" was struck by shrapnel on its deck when it arrived off Wusongkou. At the same time, the British destroyer "Harvester" was attacked in the Mediterranean by a submarine of unknown nationality. Upon hearing the news, people here were further shaken. It is reported that when the "Harvester" detected a submarine launching a torpedo at it, it immediately followed the Admiralty's instructions and retaliated with underwater bombs. Although government officials refused to comment on the matter, the "tension" in government circles was obvious. In addition, news vendors set up alarming signs in the main streets to express the outrage of ordinary people at the "piratical acts" in the Mediterranean.

### Roosevelt Summons Naval Authorities

Discusses Shanghai Situation

⊙Hyde Park President Roosevelt, currently on vacation here, recently summoned Rear Admiral Leahy, the Chief of Naval Operations, to discuss the situation in Shanghai. Afterwards, Navy Department personnel stated that the American warships in Shanghai were sufficient for evacuating僑民 and there was no need to send additional warships to assist. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 1st)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers regarding the Shanghai war, stating that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, had advised American ships several days ago not to anchor in Shanghai. The situation in the Shanghai area remains the same, and it is still difficult to predict when American ships can resume docking in Shanghai. Regarding the evacuation of American 僑民 from Shanghai, Hull stated that the government had considered several plans, but no decision had been made yet. However, naval officials said that several U.S. warships would sail to Shanghai if necessary to evacuate僑民. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 1st)

### The U.S. Maintains a Firm Attitude Towards the Far East Situation

But Retains Flexibility in Actual Actions Roosevelt Remains Attentive to the Situation During Vacation

⊙Hyde Park President Roosevelt is currently resting in this area. Although on vacation, he is still paying close attention to the Far East situation and is in constant communication with Secretary of State Hull. Observers generally believe that the attitude adopted by Roosevelt and Hull towards the Far East situation is to maintain the most resolute attitude morally, while maintaining considerable flexibility in actual actions. Morally speaking, President Roosevelt has recently delivered speeches repeatedly, harshly condemning the ideologies of autocratic countries. Secretary of State Hull has also criticized the economic policies implemented by these countries, saying that the result is that world prosperity, which is a guarantee of world peace, cannot be restored. Hull also issued a written statement on July 16, revealing fourteen principles, saying they are necessary to maintain world peace and restore general prosperity. This statement is actually a kind of hint to various countries, but American public opinion may not be prepared to accept the reasonable consequences produced by these principles. In the American media, it is also believed that the world situation has fallen into a dilemma, and the United States must exhaust all methods to avoid being involved in the vortex of war. For example, newspaper commentary, even if extremely fierce, comes to the same conclusion, advising the American authorities to act cautiously, especially regarding the conflict between China and Japan. Public opinion also uses the passive attitude of the United Kingdom after the Mukden Incident as an excuse, and advocates that the United States should stay out of the matter. In a word, American public opinion agrees with the government's current attitude of positioning itself as a defender of international morality, but with the condition that American peace must not be hindered in any way.

### Britain Sends Four More Warships to the Mediterranean to Protect Merchant Ships

Pursuing Submarines of Unknown Nationality France Suggests a Mediterranean Convention

⊙Gibraltar After the British destroyer Harvester was attacked by a submarine in Spanish waters, the destroyers "Hardy," "Hasty," "Hyperion," and "Hereward" were ordered to pursue this submarine of unknown nationality in the waters between Valencia and Alicante, Spain. British naval authorities here also told a Havas reporter that British warships in this port had been dispatched to protect British ships. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 1st)

[London] Incidents of submarines attacking ships of various countries in the Mediterranean have repeatedly occurred. The French government has therefore made a suggestion, advocating that countries along the Mediterranean coast establish a convention, so that when such incidents occur again, they can consult each other in order to deal with them jointly. British political figures originally thought that this proposal had the tendency to revive the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement and might not be realized, but since the British destroyer Harvester was also attacked in Spanish waters, the proposal put forward by France has gradually taken shape. Political figures also advocate that when the League of Nations General Assembly meets in Geneva in the coming days, representatives of the Mediterranean coastal countries, namely Britain, France, Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Egypt, must take the opportunity to exchange opinions. It is expected that when the British Cabinet holds a meeting tomorrow, Foreign Secretary Eden, Lord Privy Seal Halifax, and Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore will all participate. At that time, this issue will definitely be discussed. In addition, British public opinion is also very angry about the submarine attack incidents, and all condemn it as "piracy." The Navy Department's instructions that British warships should not only retaliate immediately when such incidents occur, but also pursue the submarines, have been unreservedly supported by public opinion.

### Colluding with Japanese Ronin to Counterfeit Currency

Liu Bin and others Collude with Japanese and Korean Ronin, Disturbing Finance is Extremely Detestable

Five people, including Liu Bin, Zhou Yuqing, Yang Jingxian, Zhao Shusheng, and Jin Diqing, previously colluded with Japanese and Korean ronin, including Wataki Hideo and Tokuda Seiji, and seven or eight others, to counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China and banknotes of the Guangdong Provincial Bank. The case was cracked by the Public Concession Police, and they were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Special Court opened a court to continue the trial. He then ordered the start of the defense. According to the opinions of the police lawyers Ru Baoyi and Qian Xunjiu, the defendants in this case coveted petty profits, colluded with Japanese people to counterfeit national currency, disrupted finance, and undermined national credit. Moreover, during this emergency period, making this move is not only detestable but also extremely serious. Therefore, the court is requested to consider the evidence and sentence the defendants to the heaviest penalty separately, as a warning to future generations. After the defendants' lawyers debated, the court announced the end of the trial and scheduled a date for sentencing.

### Foreign Ships Resume North-South Routes

Ningbo Refugees Continue to be Repatriated

Regarding the situation of various foreign shipping companies in Shanghai preparing to resume shipping routes, gradual progress has been seen. The Tai Gu Company's South China route, the "Jinan," entered port yesterday morning, unloaded a large number of goods, and is scheduled to transport goods to Hong Kong this afternoon, with a batch of refugees accompanying it to various ports in South China. Also, the company's "Wuhu" ship entered port this morning, but the Yangtze River route has been temporarily suspended. In addition, the North Ocean route's "Shuntian" ship is also about to enter port and is scheduled to depart on the 7th of this month. As for Jardine Matheson's resumption plan, it has also been agreed upon. Because the company's wharf is located in the Hongkou war zone, it is inconvenient for passengers and goods to board and disembark. Therefore, the Beijing Road wharf has been selected as a temporary stop. Today, the "Lisheng" and "Dingsheng" ships have successively resumed the South China route, departing for Guangdong and Hong Kong. The "Zesheng" ship is also scheduled to depart for Shantou on the 6th. Furthermore, on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the "Shenfu" ship departed from Shanghai for Ningbo yesterday. This morning at 11:00, the "Xinshan" ship also departed for Ningbo. However, the ship was full of refugees from Ningbo, which was agreed upon by the Ningbo Association and the Shanghai Municipal Council. Observing this situation, except for the Yangtze River route, which is difficult to restore temporarily, the South China and North China routes are already showing a lively state with congested passengers and goods.

The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association, for the purpose of repatriating native refugees, rents ships daily for round-trip transportation. Yesterday, in addition to the Shenfu ship carrying passengers and departing for Ningbo, today the Longshan ship and the Mahle ship successively entered port, loading refugees. The association's shelter has now expanded to as many as eight locations. At the same time, the rescue team departs daily, and the current funds are handled by the members' advances. They are deeply afraid that it will become a chicken after a long time, so they specially divide and ask the Shanghai fellow countrymen to donate rescue funds, love the country and their hometown, and work together to create a grand event.

### Typhoon Devastates Hong Kong

Many Chinese Sailors Die The Coastal Areas Present a Chaotic Scene

[Hong Kong] At two o'clock this morning, a typhoon passed through, with extreme force, unprecedented in many years, causing heavy losses, especially to the shipping industry. Various ships are anchored in the port here, including merchant ships that have taken refuge in Hong Kong due to Japan's blockade of the South China ports. Many ships have run aground, and many Chinese sailors have died. When the wind weakened slightly, the coastal areas presented an unprecedented chaotic scene. The wharves were completely destroyed, and the people in the small boats were obviously drowned, leaving only empty boats crashing into the coast in the wind and waves. There was also a lot of damage on the shore, with cars and trucks scattered on the road. Most of the storefronts were damaged, and all places showed a tragic scene of the typhoon. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)

[Hong Kong] Several distress telegrams from merchant ships outside the port have recently been received, reporting that they are experiencing high winds at sea. The Tai Gu Guangzhou ship ran aground south of Lema Island (transliteration), and telegraphed that the passengers and crew on board were safe, but urgently needed rescue. Also, the Tai Gu Shuntian ship ran aground in the southeast corner of Qingdao (transliteration), and telegraphed that the machinery could not be operated and assistance was needed immediately. In addition, there is a Chinese ship that is about to sink near Yuan Island, and a ship of unknown number has run aground in Guam (transliteration).

### Erroneous Rumor that the Longshan Ship Leaving Port was Shelled by Enemy Warships

The Italian merchant ship Longshan carried more than 2,000 Italian people from Shanghai to Ningbo a few days ago, and has safely arrived in Ningbo. The rumor that the ship was bombarded by enemy warships when it left the port is actually a false rumor according to the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association. The ship has now come to Shanghai from Ningbo and will arrive here soon to continue carrying refugees to Ningbo.

### Shipping Industry Cables Request to Negotiate Enemy Blockade of Southeast Coast

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, due to the illegal blockade of our Southeast coast by the enemy's Third Fleet, sent a cable to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The original cable reads: Nanjing respectfully presents to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Your Excellencies, Japan has not formally declared war on China, nor has it announced the severance of relations. The ambassadors of your country have not yet lowered their flags and returned home. However, the Third Fleet of that country has announced the blockade of our country's Southeast coast, which is a violation of international law. Our shipping merchants are the first to bear the brunt, and are unanimously indignant and will never yield. We should request that a serious protest be lodged with that country as soon as possible, and on the other hand, request that the international community make a fair judgment to uphold justice and stop the illegal actions. The Permanent Committee Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, Shen Zhongyi, and all member companies respectfully request,

### Short Commentary

— Xiang

Since the September 18th Incident, the only lesson we have learned is self-reliance and self-salvation. We will never hope that any friendly country will participate. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet conclusion of the non-aggression treaty is only to show sympathy in conscience, and there is absolutely no assistance in fact. This is what our external spokesperson has already stated. Therefore, the French newspaper commented on the Sino-Russian treaty, saying that it was like inserting a rocket on the head of a wild bull. In fact, this kind of treaty is not even considered inserting a rocket. Although the wild bull has seen this rocket, it has not yet reached its head. However, a wild bull is always a wild bull. Even if it is stuck on its head, it probably won't shout in pain. The so-called "never give up until one reaches the Yellow River."

### A Glimpse of the Mood in the Rear Area Amidst the War of Resistance (4)

— Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya

Deng Hanxiang's Speech

Sichuan currently has two major political affairs: the disaster relief issue and the military reorganization issue. Sichuan Province ordered a spring drought disaster, with an area covering more than 130 counties and about 30 million disaster victims, which can be regarded as a catastrophe after the wars in Sichuan Province. Moreover, Sichuan has always been known as a province with many soldiers, the military system is complex, and the awareness of discipline is poor. For the responsibilities that should be fulfilled, there are often flaws that cannot be concealed. This time, the authorities of various military systems were able to handle the two major events of military reorganization and disaster relief to a relatively satisfactory result with the greatest effort in a difficult environment, without any unexpected adverse effects. This is truly the blessing of Sichuan, and even more so the good fortune of China.

When I went to the Provincial Government to visit Chairman Liu Xiang, I was first received by Chief Secretary Deng Mingjie (Hanxiang). He said with a smile that Chairman Liu was currently discussing important matters with the military reorganization generals and that another letter would be required to arrange a face-to-face meeting. Then he answered the questions I asked. The following is a summary of the records:

Liu said that this time Sichuan is implementing military reorganization in accordance with the central plan, with the aim of enriching the units of the organization to meet the needs of national defense. Chairman Liu and the various army commanders have unanimously agreed to reorganize all the Sichuan-Kang armies into "reorganized divisions" within a month (by the end of August). The degree of enrichment of its content is about the original military quota of fortune, and now it is actually compiled into two fortunes. It is expected that there will be about 5,000 surplus military officers, and after consideration of back wages, they will be dismissed and returned to the fields separately. As for the North China issue, it is obviously a planned and step-by-step large-scale invasion by the Japanese. We have no other option but to resist the war. At present, the military reorganization work in Sichuan is nearing completion. The autumn harvest of rice in various counties can be more than 70%. For all the responsibilities that our Sichuan Province should fulfill to the country, such as ㊀ listening to the adjustment of the teachers to the front line, ㊁ maintaining the rear governance and security of this province, and ㊂ supplying the material needs of the front line as much as possible, I all take responsible talk, and I have considerable strength and grasp, and I am willing to encourage fellow countrymen across the country together.

Liu Xiang Interview Record

Chairman Liu was indeed very busy and did not agree to an urgent meeting, but first sent a written statement. It roughly stated that the Sichuan army is large in quantity but lacks quality, which is an undeniable fact, and a thorough reorganization is necessary. Since the military reorganization conference agreed on various plans, the army commanders have been able to deeply appreciate the difficulties of the times and unanimously expressed their acceptance. I have repeatedly telegraphed to Chairman Chiang, who is responsible for the heavy task of pacifying Sichuan and Kang, expressing my firm determination to thoroughly implement the military reorganization. The national environment is dangerous, and without a unified and sound army, it is not enough to save the country and survive. If the Sichuan army is not actively reorganized and enriched, it will be difficult to adapt to the needs of national defense. Therefore, I am determined to make the greatest effort, no matter what dangers and difficulties, I must achieve the predetermined goal before I finish. Moreover, the situation in North China today is extremely dangerous, and the enemy has fully mobilized, and I am also determined to resist the war. Although Sichuan is in the rear, the various preparatory work must not be delayed. In short, all the human and financial resources of Sichuan can be contributed to the country. The army must go to the front line, and the people must respond in the rear. Internally and externally consistent, in order to fulfill the responsibilities that the people of Sichuan should fulfill. Wherever justice lies, I will not hesitate to go through fire and water. At present, in addition to actively engaging in military reorganization and various preparatory work, the most important thing is production and construction. The provincial government has begun to draft a three-year construction plan, and I am also determined to do my best to promote its realization.

I happened to encounter continuous rainy days in Sichuan, the low-lying roads in Chengdu were flooded like rivers, the Chengdu-Chongqing Road was not open to traffic, and the planes were temporarily grounded. Therefore, I could not leave Chengdu as scheduled, so I took the opportunity to visit Chairman Liu at his private residence in Sanduo Lane. The residence had several Chinese-style doors, lined up along the alley, and four or five soldiers guarded it, each wearing a broadsword and a box cannon. People entered the door and went around the corridor, and suddenly saw a tall Western-style building surrounded by trees, which was said to have been built and presented by General Yang Sen. After a while, Liu appeared in the living room and added this opinion to the written statement. Liu's opinion roughly stated that thousands of miles of rivers and mountains in North China, the 700-year-old cultural relics of the old capital, and the 4 million people of Pingjin should not be allowed to be trampled on arbitrarily by the iron hooves of the violent Japanese, as in the "September 18th" incident. Judging from the two speeches delivered by Chairman Chiang in Lushan, we know that our authorities have also made a painful decision, adhered to our position, and will never allow the violent acts of Japan to expand again. However, in order to obtain this minimum expectation, we must exhaust all the strength of the soldiers and civilians across the country to deal with the enemy. For this reason, I have telegraphed Chairman Chiang several times to ask for permission to resist the war, and have received approving replies. From a certain point of view, our preparations are still not enough, but the enemy's aggressive behavior of gaining an inch is approaching our vital interests step by step, and we must not relax any longer. We deeply believe that, under the leadership of the central government, we will hold on to the determination of "rather be a broken jade than a complete tile" and continue to resist the war for more than a year, and the god of final victory will wave to us.

Looking at the statements issued by the Sichuan authorities, their attitude of supporting the central government and launching a nationwide war of resistance has been consistent from beginning to end and is extremely firm.

### The Tragic Situation of Refugees at the South Station Being Bombed by Japanese Aircraft

### Shanghai Municipal Council Reports on Refugee Relief Work

More Than 340,000 People Have Been Sent Abroad

According to news from the Municipal Council, the number of refugees in the Public Concession at present is still difficult to estimate accurately, but regarding the number of poor households and refugees who have already returned to their hometowns, according to the closest estimate, from August 12 to August 24, the number of people who left the South Station for Hangzhou and the stations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was about 300,000, and the number of people who took ships or inland river boats to Ningbo and other places in the interior was more than 40,000, but the actual number may be more than that. Those who stay in the Public Concession (mostly in shelters, but there are thousands of people living in residences and sleeping in alleys) are also closely monitored and cared for by the authorities. The donations received for relief work are quite satisfactory. The Municipal Council has promised to donate 10,000 yuan for refugee relief, which is the initiation of various Chinese and foreign groups, and hopes that the Municipal Council's donation can arouse the response of many important groups, as well as wealthier families and the middle class, to relieve the refugees in Shanghai.

### News of School Openings in Shanghai During Extraordinary Times

In order to adapt to the wartime economic situation, the school has also set up a method of paying fees in installments.

Dare to Take on the Education of Refugees

Qi Yifen, Principal of Daqian Elementary School, and a member of the Chinese Women's Federation, believes that refugee reception and education are essential for a long-term war of resistance. Therefore, a refugee shelter was established at the school a week ago, and students were ordered to be little teachers to educate the refugees, instilling wartime common sense, lecturing on national heroes, and telling stories of Japanese atrocities, as well as reporting current events. Spare time is taken to solicit clothes, shoes, socks, and other items from the parents of the students, which are distributed to the refugees. Therefore, the refugees in the shelter can all take care of public property and abide by order.

Ma Zhujun and Others from Changshu are Fraudulently Registering and Collecting Donations

Since the start of the Shanghai war, all hometown associations have done their best to find ways to relieve and shelter refugees, or send them back to their hometowns. However, Ma Zhujun (aka Huangfu Du) and others from Changshu took this opportunity to organize the Changshu Hometown Temporary Relief Association and published announcements instructing all fellow villagers to register in advance to engage in repatriation. During the registration process, Ma and others extorted certain donations from the refugees. The amount of income in recent days is extremely considerable. Some people who were forced not to follow their fellow villagers immediately reported to the Shanghai Relief Committee. After the committee sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts yesterday afternoon, they brought the witnesses back together and decided to transfer these unscrupulous elements to the police station for strict investigation tomorrow.
