### Zhang Yang's Troops Show No Obvious Signs of Withdrawal

Central Army Organizes Surveillance Teams; No Advancement in the Chishui Area; Important Meeting Held in Xi'an; Mi Chunlin and Others Fly from Tongguan

[Nanjing] The aftermath of the Shaanxi-Gansu pacification has become dull. Yang and Zhang's troops have not yet followed the central government's order to retreat. Yang and others seem to be delaying, and whether they have other intentions is difficult to determine. It is heard that the central government still intends to be lenient towards Yang and others, hoping that they will realize their mistake and not create complications by withdrawing their troops as ordered. Therefore, negotiations have not been interrupted so far. (1st day special dispatch)

[Nanjing] According to a certain agency, Zhang's troops in Weinan have not canceled their wartime deployments and have even raised various trivial issues. The front-line central army generals are extremely indignant but are patiently awaiting the central government's maximum tolerance. After Yu Xuezhong and Deng Baoshan arrived in Shaanxi, a meeting was held in Xi'an on the evening of the 31st, attended by Yang Hucheng, Miao Chengliu, and various generals from Zhang and Yang's troops. Whether they will thoroughly realize their mistake depends on this meeting. He Zhuguo has returned to Xi'an to attend the meeting. Feng Qinzai telegraphed the President the previous day, reporting his loyalty to the central government and completing his defense duties in his defense area. Yang Hucheng's troops have built four lines of trenches near Dali, but the front line is still peaceful. Xi'an has no funds for military expenses, and the finances are in dire straits. All special education funds in the province, central government tax revenues, and cash stored in banks have been withdrawn by Yang Hucheng under some pretext. The financial panic is extreme, and social order is deteriorating daily. (1st day special dispatch)

[Nanjing] Representatives of Yang Hucheng and Wang Yizhe, Mi Chunlin, He Zhuguo, and Xie Ke, arrived in Tongguan to meet with Director Gu Zhutong. They are continuing discussions in Tongguan and Luoyang, but there are three points on which Mi and others still need to consult with Yang Hucheng before making a decision. Mi Chunlin and others flew back to Xi'an from Luoyang in a chartered Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane at around 1:00 PM on the 1st, and they should be able to return from Shaanxi to Tongguan on the morning of the 2nd. (1st day special dispatch)

[Luoyang] The central army has organized surveillance teams to reside in Weinan and monitor the retreat of the Northeast Army. The Tongguan-West roadbed should be repaired and open to traffic in about a week. (1st day special dispatch)

[Zhengzhou] Two central armored trains are operating between Huazhou and Chishui to protect the road repair work. The destroyed road tracks and sleepers are approximately three Chinese miles long. Sufficient road repair materials have been prepared, and after the situation in the front develops further, the road can be opened to traffic as soon as possible. (1st day special dispatch)

Tongguan: After Director Gu arrived in Tongguan, Xie Ke and Mi Chunlin both went to visit him. (1st day Central News Agency dispatch)

[Xuzhou] According to road news, the Longhai Railway Bureau is transferring trainees from the eastern section to Tongguan to prepare for the opening of the Tongguan-West section. However, the engineering personnel are waiting in Tongguan for the complete withdrawal of troops from the western section before proceeding. The railway authorities say that the bridge damage in Chishui and Weinan is minimal and easy to repair. Once Yang's troops have completely withdrawn on the 1st, restoring traffic will not be difficult. (1st day special dispatch)

[Luoyang] Due to complex internal problems in Xi'an, and the Red bandits interfering in the middle, the atmosphere of peace has been fluctuating daily. Although the outposts of Zhang's and Yang's troops in the Chishui area have moved back slightly, the majority show no obvious signs of withdrawal. The central army entering Shaanxi is currently only closely monitoring in the Chishui area, and the majority has not advanced forward. (1st day Central News Agency dispatch)

[Luoyang] Yang Hucheng's 1st Brigade of the Shaanxi Police, stationed in Longxian, extensively looted banks and shops on the evening of the 28th of last month and then hastily abandoned the city and retreated towards Yiyang and Fengxiang. The central army stationed near Tianshui dispatched troops to maintain order upon receiving the report on the afternoon of the 30th. (1st day Central News Agency dispatch)

[Luoyang] The bandit Mao Zedong has established a pseudo-central government in Fushi and is commanding his more than 3,000 men to disturb the areas of Ganquan and Luochuan. (1st day Central News Agency dispatch)

[Luoyang] Sun Mingjiu, the former battalion commander of Zhang Xueliang's guard, is a key member of the Xi'an bandit gang. The hidden bandit party within Zhang's troops is entirely under his command. After the Xi'an Incident, he was promoted to commander of the special service regiment. Recently, Sun has been sending telegrams to various generals of Zhang and Yang's troops, advocating a "three-in-one" approach, uniting to resist the central government, and saying that recent contacts with the central government for peace are purely a delaying tactic. (1st day Central News Agency dispatch)

[Luoyang] Recently, the pseudo-provincial government of Xi'an has been frequently replacing county magistrates. The newly appointed magistrate of Zhen'an County launched an armed force of more than 300 men to attack the county seat. The original magistrate led the local forces to resist, but they were outnumbered and eventually occupied. The internal affairs of the county government are entirely controlled by the Red bandits. (Central News Agency, 1st day dispatch)

[Nanjing] (1) According to people from Xi'an, although Zhang and Yang's troops claim to be acting in unison, they are actually at odds with each other, each harboring selfish intentions. Yang Hucheng aims to expand his power, maintain his territory, and deliberately delay in order to wait for a change in the situation. The generals of Zhang's troops are disorganized and hesitant, with no one daring to make firm decisions. Therefore, although the central government is willing to make repeated concessions in the hope of a peaceful resolution, they often contradict and deny, creating unnecessary complications, resulting in much discussion but no decision, or decisions that are not implemented. It is difficult to be optimistic about the future. (2) Regarding the withdrawal of Zhang and Yang's troops in accordance with the Shaanxi-Gansu Post-Pacification Plan, after repeated consultations between Director Gu Zhutong and their representatives, it was originally decided that starting from January 28th, all troops near Xi'an and Shangxian and north of the Wei River would be withdrawn to areas west of Sanyuan. The central government also agreed to provide Zhang and Yang's troops with one month's funding and post-pacification expenses to facilitate their movement. However, as of now, five days have passed, and there is still no definite news of the start of the movement, suggesting that they are deliberately delaying or have other intentions, which is also unknown. (3) According to reports from airplanes sent to inspect the withdrawal situation, the front-line troops of their army show no signs of withdrawal and are intensifying the construction of outer trenches and artillery positions in the Xiaoyi-Chishui area. A train was also seen, fully loaded with soldiers and horses, heading east. (4) The 1st Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the Shaanxi Police, which is part of Yang Hucheng's troops stationed in Longxian, suddenly extensively looted on the evening of January 28th. All banks and shops were emptied. After the looting, they hastily abandoned the city and fled towards Yiyang and Fengxiang. After receiving the report, the central army stationed near Tianshui dispatched troops to maintain order. (5) The 108th Division, 117th Division, and 3rd Cavalry Division of the Northeast Army, stationed near Guyuan, suddenly moved continuously towards Pingliang and Wating in the southeast on January 27th, with unclear intentions. (6) The pseudo-central headquarters of the Red bandits in Yan'an declared that various parties in Inner Mongolia have united, but the bandit transformation work has not been fully completed, and they are unwilling to take risks lightly. Therefore, whether to go west or find a way out to the southeast has not yet been decided. (1st day Central News Agency dispatch)

### Yen Hui-ching Arrives in Tianjin, Denies He Will Assume an Important Position

Plans to Reside in Tianjin Long-Term to Run Industries; Visit to Chairman Lin Was to Report on His Mission

[Tianjin] Yen Hui-ching returned to Tianjin from Beijing on the morning of the 1st and denied external reports that he would assume an important position in the central government. He said he was determined to dedicate himself to running industries and would still travel abroad for inspection in the short term. (1st day dispatch)

[Tianjin] Yen Hui-ching returned to Tianjin from Beijing at 10:40 AM on the 1st on the Pinghu train. According to him, "I spent more than ten days on this trip to the south and visited old friends in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. I did not go to Fenghua to visit Chairman Chiang. I visited Chairman Lin and the ministers of various yuan in Beijing and Shanghai because I had not yet reported my mission one by one after returning from the Soviet Union, so I reported the details of my mission separately. The rumor that I will assume an important position in the government is not true. I have been engaged in political life for a long time, and recently I have been old and sick and in urgent need of rest, so it is difficult to take on arduous tasks again. In the future, I plan to retire in Tianjin for a long time and continue to run various industries to spend my old age. The Qixin Cement Company, which we operate, recently established the Jiangnan Cement Plant in Qixia Mountain, Beijing, with a capital of more than two million yuan. The interior adopts the latest equipment in the world and will be in production in July this year. Its output is the same as the Tangshan plant. Because I am the chairman of the company, I still went to inspect it during my trip to the south." (1st day Central News Agency dispatch)

### Zeng Yangfu Reports on Political Construction

[Guangzhou] Zeng Yangfu reported on the recent progress of Guangdong and the efforts that should be made in the future during the expanded memorial week on the 1st. He briefly stated that under today's circumstances, China has two major problems in the political aspect: ㊀ We should enrich our national strength to seek restoration; ㊁ Strive for economic construction to relieve the people's difficulties. There are three most important constructions in Guangdong Province: ㊀ Transportation. We must actively seek convenient transportation between Guangdong and neighboring provinces. Connecting to Guangxi in the west can develop connections to Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan to reach the Northwest. Connecting to Jiangxi and Fujian in the east can form a complete area with the southeastern provinces. ㊁ Industry. We must develop steel plants and the Wengjiang Hydroelectric Plant to obtain raw materials and motive power. ㊂ Agriculture. Guangdong has approximately 25 million mu of rice paddies, which can harvest more than 50 million dan. Distributing this to more than 30 million people is not enough. If we improve varieties and planting methods, we can increase by 20% to 30%. In addition, if we increase the opening up of wasteland, improve water conservancy, and apply fertilizers, we can fundamentally solve the problem of people's food.

### Wang Jingwei's Report at the National Government Memorial Week

To Carry Out Foreign Policy, Domestic Unity and Stability are Essential; The Purpose of the War of Resistance is Threefold: to Seek Victory, to Seek Endurance, and to Seek Self-Sacrifice; The Central Government Should Punish Those Who Undermine Unity and Stability; Wu Jingheng Speaks at the Central Memorial Week on Catching Up Head-On

[Nanjing] The National Government held a memorial week at 10 a.m. on the 1st. Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Deng Jiayan, Lin Yunhai, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Shuren, Chu Minyi, Chen Xunbing, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, and other officials from the National Government and various ministries and commissions, totaling more than 800 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Committee Member Wang Zhaoming gave a report. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 1st)

[Nanjing] The following is the original text of Committee Member Wang Zhaoming's report at the National Government Memorial Week on the 1st: "Chairman, fellow comrades, on the 18th of last month, when I returned to the capital to participate in the National Government's memorial week, the Chairman instructed me to say a few words. At that time, having been away from the country for almost a year, I was afraid that what I said would not be relevant, so I held back. Today, I have once again received the Chairman's instruction, and I am still afraid that what I say may be inappropriate or already known and acted upon by my fellow comrades. Therefore, I can only take this opportunity to ask my fellow comrades for guidance. When I first arrived in Europe in April of last year to treat my injuries and illnesses, what I heard and saw was mostly disappointment with collective security. The general idea was that the weaknesses of collective security had been exposed without reservation, and from then on, each country would decide its own fate. The victorious countries after the Great War would do their best to preserve their vested rights, while the defeated countries would do their best to restore their lost rights. They would do everything in their power to engage in war preparations, not only shifting the majority of the social welfare funds originally intended for improving welfare to war preparations but even requiring every citizen to tighten their belts and save every drop of sweat and blood for national defense. After a few more months, what I heard and saw was slightly different. Governments and people of all countries were working hard to engage in war preparations and had not relaxed their efforts but had only intensified them. However, the disappointment with collective security had slightly changed. They sincerely acknowledged the weaknesses of collective security, but they did not attribute it to the system of collective security but to themselves, believing that the reason why the system of collective security was so weak was simply because the member states were unwilling to work hard to enhance collective security and strengthen the power of collective security. From then on, they should not only be disappointed with collective security but should also make the system of collective security more established in the world and make great progress. Of course, the victorious countries were still reluctant to give up their vested rights, but they dared not excessively despise and ignore the urgent demands of the defeated countries to restore their lost rights. This work of intensifying war preparations and maintaining the system of collective security was carried out simultaneously, which seems contradictory but is actually consistent because aversion to war and hope for peace are, of course, the same for all people. However, without war preparations and determination, it is impossible to maintain peace. The responsibility for maintaining peace cannot be attributed to those who live in ease and seek only to survive but should be attributed to those who are always on edge, flexing their muscles, and preparing for war. In other words, the more prepared you are for war, the less likely peace is to be broken. Everyone must know that war is not easy and that there is no absolute certainty of victory before they are willing to take the path of maintaining peace. If, unfortunately, peace cannot be maintained and war eventually breaks out, people must also know who the instigator of the war is. Not only should people abroad know, but even people in his own country should know. The ferocious face of militarism must not be disguised with the mask of self-defense. In this way, although the militarist may be able to act arbitrarily for a time, he will eventually be abandoned by the whole world and by his own people. Although the system of collective security may suffer temporary setbacks, the progress that follows is inevitable. In recent months, the concept of collective security in European countries seems to have evolved in this way. Of course, this cannot be said to be our highest ideal, but the current trend seems to be only this way. In this trend, what is the situation in China? Originally, our aspiration was to strive to build China into a modern country in an environment of international peace. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of the past few years is really contrary to our aspirations. Not only is there no peace to speak of, but the disaster of extinction is imminent. Our government and people can only grit their teeth, stand firm, and do the work of saving the nation and seeking survival. Our foreign policy has been repeatedly explained by the central government in recent years. Not only has it been explained, but it has also gradually become a reality. In terms of negotiation, we strive to restore diplomatic normalcy; in terms of resistance, we strive not to lose any territorial sovereignty. This policy is the only way to save the nation and seek survival. It was so in the past, it is so now, and it will be so in the future. What I want to say now is not to discuss this policy but how this policy can overcome difficulties in order to achieve continuous progress. I believe that if we want the foreign policy to be carried out step by step, we must have domestic unity and stability. To give an example, if we want an army to be able to fight foreign enemies, the internal organization of the army must be sound. The same is true for the country. There is no country that cannot maintain unity and stability within itself and can talk about foreign affairs. Because the purpose of the war of resistance is threefold: the first is to seek victory, the second is to seek endurance, and the third is to seek self-sacrifice. The so-called self-sacrifice is not suicide but sacrificing life to preserve personality after exhausting all strength. This kind of self-sacrificing heart should be possessed not only by every soldier but also by every citizen, not only during wartime but also during peacetime. With the heart of self-sacrifice, the policy of saving the nation and seeking survival has a foundation. With this foundation, we can seek endurance. All the mental and physical strength of the people of the whole country are used in the work of saving the nation and seeking survival. Accumulating one point is one point. The more the people's mental and physical strength is accumulated, the more the national strength is enriched, and the more the external strength is increased. This accumulation is not easy. Without domestic unity and stability, it cannot be accumulated. We must know that starting a war is resistance, and accumulation is also resistance. Moreover, whether the war of resistance can last depends on this. In today's situation where culture and industry are lagging behind in everything, we should not talk highly about victory. As long as we can endure, the hope of victory will not be without assurance. In recent years, domestic unity and stability cannot be said to have made no progress. Military unity and political unity have gradually been achieved, and economic unity will follow. We must know that a country can achieve economic unity only then is it truly unified. The National Economic Construction Movement is focused on this. This is the necessary work to save the nation and seek survival. However, since December 12th of last year, domestic unity and stability have been shaken. This means that the work of saving the nation and seeking survival has shaken its foundation. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang escaped danger, and fortunately, there is a hope for a peaceful resolution of the aftermath. However, upon careful observation, there seem to be various hidden worries, that is, some people are hiding in the dark and still doing things that undermine the work of saving the nation and seeking survival. Their attempt is clearly to undermine the saving of the nation and seek survival, but they insist on raising slogans, saying that the current work of saving the nation and seeking survival is not suitable. For example, they have a slogan (攘外必先安內 - "to resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the internal"). This saying seems to emphasize resisting foreign aggression on the surface, but in reality, it undermines the basic work of resisting foreign aggression because whether resisting foreign aggression is effective depends entirely on how the work of pacifying the internal is done. The whole country must have the reality of sincere unity before it can accumulate strength to seek endurance under the overall plan and certain steps. We are not saying that we must accumulate to a certain degree before we can talk about sacrifice. If the environment reaches the point where sacrifice is required, we will naturally throw all the accumulation at once. However, before the last breath, the work of accumulation must not be slackened. We know that since the Xi'an Incident, not only has the work of suppressing bandits been stalled, but also national defense equipment has been lost. Various heartbreaking things cannot be fully described. The people of the country only hope that after this incident, they will understand that the work of saving the nation and seeking survival is always being undermined, and domestic unity and stability are always being shaken. We must use all our strength to maintain and support it. When an army's guns are pointed outwards, if some lawless soldiers violate discipline, the commander must immediately punish them. This kind of punishment cannot be said to be eagerly dealing with internal affairs and reducing external strength. It is better to say that this is precisely for the sake of maintaining and strengthening external strength. The same is true for the country. If someone is determined to undermine domestic unity and stability, the central government should use force to punish them and must not obstruct them under the pretext of stopping the civil war. This is not only for the sake of pacifying the internal but also for the sake of resisting foreign aggression. The above words are to explain that we should now have a unified determination and move forward vigorously based on the overall plan and certain steps for saving the nation and seeking survival. When we move forward vigorously, we will not hesitate to overcome all difficulties. We firmly believe that our urgent demands for saving the nation and seeking survival will receive the sympathy and assistance of humanity and justice. Those who harbor aggressive ambitions and seek to achieve their goals through militarism will only perish if they do not wake up. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 1st)

[Nanjing] The Central Committee held its 61st memorial week at 9 a.m. on the 1st. Wu Jingheng, Ju Zheng, Ye Liangcang, Chen Lifu, Sun Ke, Jiang Zuobao, Chu Minyi, Zhu Peide, Gan Naiguang, Wu Zhongxin, Fang Zhi, Xu Enzeng, Zhou Qigang, Zhou Fohei, Zhang Lisheng, Ji Zonghuang, Wang Luyi, and dozens of other people, as well as all the staff, totaling about 700 people, attended. Wu Jingheng presided over the meeting and gave an impromptu report, briefly saying that recently there has been a kind of "leaping forward" ideology in the world. This kind of unprincipled and irrational action seems very shocking. We don't need to panic, and we don't need to imitate it. We only need to use the principle that Dr. Sun Yat-sen showed us - to catch up head-on - to guard against it. Catching up means increasing strength on the right track. What do we use to catch up? We can only rely on the treasures that Sun Yat-sen bequeathed to us, that is, the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," the "Outline of National Reconstruction," the "Three Principles of the People," and so on. Strive to implement them, and we will catch up. At the beginning of the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," Sun Yat-sen also put forward the theory of "knowing is difficult, doing is easy." These treasures are exactly the "knowing is difficult" part. Sun Yat-sen has already shown us and taken responsibility for us. He has only left us the "doing is easy" part to continue our efforts. However, from now on, it is not too late for us to catch up head-on. The plan that Sun Yat-sen gave to the opposition party in his early years is also what China should have caught up head-on. I ask everyone to work hard to achieve the following: ㊀ "Make the best use of everyone's talents" does not mean that everyone should have the talent to govern the country and bring peace to the world. How can society accommodate so many great talents? It should be one in a thousand. This is to enable those who truly govern the country and bring peace to the world to govern the country and bring peace to the world. Those who can make the best use of the land should be taught to make the best use of the land. Those who can make the best use of resources should be taught to make the best use of resources. Those who can facilitate the flow of goods should be taught to facilitate the flow of goods. This kind of education can be considered as making the best use of everyone's talents, not just sending everyone to university and being done with it. ㊁ "Make the best use of the land" is not just about having abundant harvests every year. It is not enough to have things that have existed since ancient times and still exist today. We must use the things underground, find ways to create what does not exist, and turn the ordinary into the special. ㊂ "Make the best use of resources" is not just about being able to produce large quantities of soybeans, cotton, silk, and land. We must turn them into goods and export them or make them ourselves and use them ourselves. It is not enough to simply establish the country on agriculture. ㊃ "Facilitate the flow of goods" is not just about building many railways and highways to make the flow of goods easier for others. We must ensure that the goods flowing on the highways and railways are all ours. Therefore, we must ask a few comrades who govern the country and bring peace to the world to follow Sun Yat-sen's plan to make the best use of everyone's talents, and enable those who have the talent to make the best use of the land to make the best use of the land, those who can make the best use of resources to make the best use of resources, and those who can facilitate the flow of goods to facilitate the flow of goods. Then, everyone will naturally know how to catch up quickly head-on. Leaping forward is a childish disease of the present era, and only a good doctor who can catch up head-on can treat it. After Wu finished his speech, the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 1st)

### Zheng Baozhao Goes to Wuhu to Direct Rice Transport

[Nanjing] Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Food Transport and Sales Bureau, has traveled from Shanghai via Nanjing to Wuhu to direct the transport of rice to Guangdong to relieve the famine. He will then transfer from Wuhu to Guangdong to join Liang Dingshu, representative of the Ministry of Industry, to investigate the truth about the rice famine in order to draft detailed relief measures. As for the proposal of the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce to request a six-month exemption from import duties on foreign rice, it must wait until Zheng and Liang complete their investigation and report before it can be approved. However, it is heard that since the implementation of the measures to relieve the Guangdong rice famine passed by the Executive Yuan, rice from Hunan and Wuhu has been transported to Guangdong by land and sea in large quantities every day. The authorities believe that it will not be difficult to solve the Guangdong rice famine by finding ways to relieve it with the rice that has been hoarded.

### Personnel Choices for Japanese Navy and Army Ministers Decided; The Lin Cabinet is Largely Complete

Ambassador to the US Saito Appointed Foreign Minister; Kengo Appointed Finance Minister is Most Notable; Administrative Policy Adopts Gradualism

[Tokyo] Lin Senjuro's formation of a new cabinet fell into difficulty regarding the selection of Army and Navy ministers. After mediation last night, both sides were willing to compromise, so the tension has now eased. This morning, Terauchi invited Education Director-General Sugiyama, Deputy Chief of Staff Nishio, Vice Minister of the Army Umezu, Director-General of the Education Director-General's Office Nakamura, and Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Isotani to a meeting to decide to recommend Nakamura Kotaro, who had previously been decided upon, as Army Minister. However, it is heard that he has agreed to have Itagaki as Vice Minister of the Army. The Navy authorities have changed their original proposal and decided to recommend Yonai Mitsumasa as Navy Minister, so the two positions of Army and Navy ministers seem to have been decided as mentioned above. Among the remaining cabinet members, only three have accepted the offer to join the cabinet: Saito Hiroshi, the current Ambassador to the US; Yuki Toyotaro, President of the Industrial Bank of Japan; and Kawarada Yuichika, former Vice Minister of the Interior. They have respectively agreed to serve as Foreign, Finance, and Interior Ministers. Shiga Shinji has withdrawn from the new cabinet and has refused to take office as Chief Cabinet Secretary because of disagreements with Lin Senjuro over the selection of new cabinet members. That position has now been assigned to Ohashi Hachiro. The entire list of the new cabinet can be decided today and the appointment ceremony will be held tomorrow. Yuki Toyotaro is the most authoritative representative of the Japanese financial clique, so Yuki's entry may delay the tendency of the extreme right wing. Saito is a relatively stable and moderate figure in the Japanese diplomatic circles, so the direction of the new cabinet can be imagined to some extent. There are still problems with the new cabinet's policies in some areas, especially regarding the unresolved issue of dissolving the parliament. The points on which no compromise has been reached have not yet been resolved. The future of the Lin cabinet after its establishment is still difficult, no less so than that of the Hirota cabinet. Yesterday, the Navy authorities submitted three opinions to Lin, the contents of which were: ㊀ The 1937 naval budget is very important and must be implemented. ㊁ In terms of policy, strictly adhere to the constitution and absolutely avoid radical political movements. ㊂ Although a renewal of all government affairs is necessary, it should only be done through sound and rational reforms and should not be a rapid change. These opinions are bound to have an important impact on the news, so they have aroused serious attention. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 1st)

[Tokyo] Since the personnel choices for the seven ministers of Army, Navy, Foreign, Finance, Interior, Justice, and Commerce have been decided, the victory of the new cabinet can be said to be secured. Among the new cabinet members, Yuki Toyotaro is the most noteworthy. In general, people have expressed a warm welcome to Yuki, especially in the financial and industrial circles. People in the financial and industrial circles all agree that Yuki's entry into the cabinet is the biggest gain for the Lin Senjuro cabinet. It is heard that Yuki's only condition for entering the cabinet was the change of the financial policy of former Finance Minister Baba. After Yuki takes office, all parties are closely watching whether he can avoid breaking his word. However, Yuki's financial policy, such as disbursing sufficient military expenses, increasing productivity, and the so-called stabilizing people's lives, seems to be not much different from Baba's policy. However, it is generally said that the aspirations of the two are very different. It is said that Yuki attaches great importance to economic diplomacy with China and trade policy with the UK. It is particularly noteworthy whether it is Yuki's proposal to select leaders in the economic sector to serve as future ambassadors to China. It is heard that Yonai Masamitsu also attached conditions to accepting the position of Navy Minister. In addition to requiring the unification of diplomacy and a re-examination of the existing China diplomacy, the content is largely the same as the opinions of the Navy authorities. It is said that the conditions for Nakamura Kotaro to be invited to join the cabinet can be described as follows: ㊀ Fully recognize the Army Ministry's request regarding the implementation of the national defense budget and the increase of army expenses for six consecutive years. ㊁ Implement innovation policies and other policies advocated by the previous Army Minister as soon as possible. Given the fact that important cabinet members have obtained guarantees for the implementation of their conditions, it is feared that serious disputes will inevitably arise when the new cabinet decides on policies. The position of Foreign Minister is currently temporarily held concurrently by Lin Senjuro before Saito Hiroshi returns to Tokyo. It is widely rumored that Shiratori Toshio has been appointed as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Shiga Shinji's sudden refusal to join the cabinet today is quite important because it has confirmed that Lin supports "gradualism." Shiga's radicalism has been rejected by Lin. From this, it can be seen that Shiga seems to have close ties with middle-ranking army officers. The position of Minister of Commerce and Industry has been invited to Nakajima Chikuhei, a major aircraft manufacturer and a wealthy man in the Seiyukai. His entry into the cabinet is conditional on withdrawing from the party. This move has sparked speculation that the future cabinet is preparing to create a new political party.

### Saito Hiro Appointed Foreign Minister

Prime Minister Temporarily Serves Concurrently Before Returning Home

[Tokyo] The current Ambassador to the United States, Saito Hiro, has been decided upon for the position of Foreign Minister. Before his return to Japan, the Prime Minister will temporarily serve concurrently as Foreign Minister.

If Saito Hiro assumes the position of Foreign Minister, the Vice-Minister position will be filled by Shiro Ariyoshi, currently the Minister to Sweden, who is returning home. The position of Ambassador to the United States will be succeeded by the current Vice-Minister, Horiuchi Kensuke.

The experiences of Saito Hiro, the Foreign Minister of the Hayashi Cabinet, are as follows: Mr. Saito is from Niigata Prefecture, is 51 years old this year, and graduated from the Political Science Department of Tokyo Imperial University in July of the 43rd year of Meiji (1910). He passed the Higher Civil Service Examination and has held positions such as Diplomatic Attaché at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Third Secretary of the Embassy, Second Secretary, and Consul-General. In the 4th year of Showa (1929), he was appointed as the Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In November of the same year, he was appointed as an attendant to the London Naval Conference. In the 5th year of Showa (1930), he transferred to Counselor at the British Embassy. In December of the 6th year of Showa (1931), he attended the Geneva Disarmament Conference. In January of the 8th year of Showa (1933), he was appointed as the Minister to the Netherlands. In May, he served as the acting Japanese Plenipotentiary at the London International Economic Conference. In December of the 8th year of Showa (1933), he was appointed as the Ambassador to the United States, and in May of the 9th year of Showa (1934), he also served concurrently as the Minister to Cuba, until today. (1st day, Domei News Agency)

### Yuki Toyotaro Appointed Minister of Finance

Financial Circles Express Satisfaction

[Tokyo] Yuki Toyotaro, who has been decided upon as the Minister of Finance, told reporters at his residence in Azabu, "I recently met with General Hayashi and inquired about his intentions, and also explained my own intentions. We have reached a mutual understanding. As for my policies, I cannot announce them until I receive the official order, but General Hayashi has completely entrusted financial and economic matters to me." (1st day, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] General Hayashi, in view of the current domestic and international situation, recognizes the extremely serious future of Japan's finances. In order to deal with important financial issues such as the budget, tax system, and economic controls, he carefully considered candidates to succeed as Minister of Finance. As a result, he decided that Yuki Toyotaro was the most appropriate person. On the 31st, he arranged for someone to meet with Yuki and negotiate. Yuki did not fully agree with Minister Baba's budget compilation policy and tax system reform plan. According to Yuki's opinion, although the massive budget centered on national defense expenses and increased taxes are unavoidable, Baba's plan needs to be modified to some extent. Therefore, General Hayashi agreed to this condition, and Yuki accepted the offer to join the cabinet. (1st day, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] Financial circles have shown full favor and support for the decision of Yuki Toyotaro to assume the position of Minister of Finance. Yuki is originally an outstanding figure in the financial world, and his personality and skills are considered first-class by financial circles. Financial circles are planning to re-examine the excessive financial and economic policies of Minister Baba, and are deeply expecting to sweep away the anxieties of the financial world. Yuki is a specialist in the financial field, and since the 7th year of Showa (1932), he has been the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, personally contacting and experiencing the rapidly developing Japanese industry. Therefore, Yuki is very familiar with the actual conditions and demands of the financial and business circles. Financial circles are worried about the innovative policies of the Hayashi Cabinet, especially the excess of control, and expect them to be adjusted by Yuki's insights. Furthermore, Yuki has been advocating for budget cuts, revisions to the tax system reform plan, revisions to diplomatic policies, especially the establishment of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in Chinese diplomacy, and the correction of trade relations with the British Empire (including all territories). This time, when he agreed to become the Minister of Finance, he must have strongly advocated the above points to General Hayashi. Therefore, even if Yuki's claims cannot be fully realized, at least corrections to tax system reforms, the establishment of trade diplomacy, the stabilization of national life centered on price issues, the expansion of production, and the resolution of various pending issues in the financial world are expected to be realized through Yuki's efforts. (1st day, Domei News Agency)

### Lieutenant General Nakamura Accepts the Position of Army Minister

Verbal Expression of Hope

[Tokyo] Traditionally, when the Army Minister joins a new cabinet, he must submit policy conditions in writing and ensure their implementation. However, General Hayashi has a considerable determination to actively implement innovative policies and is fully aware of the Army's movements and what it hopes for. Therefore, when Lieutenant General Nakamura accepted the cabinet negotiation from General Hayashi at the cabinet formation headquarters on the morning of the 1st, he did not attach any conditions. He only verbally expressed hope in the following meaning: ① Regarding the Army's new national defense enhancement plan, which is scheduled to be implemented from next year, he hopes that the total budget, continued years, and annual allocation will be fully approved. ② Regarding all other issues of reforming the government, he requests that what has been hoped for since the previous year be implemented as soon as possible. General Hayashi agreed to all of this, so Lieutenant General Nakamura immediately accepted the position of Army Minister. (1st day, Domei News Agency)

### Vice Admiral Yonai Decided to Be Navy Minister

Nagano Appointed Fleet Commander

[Tokyo] It has been decided that Vice Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa, Commander of the Combined Fleet, will be appointed as the Minister of the Navy.

The successor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the First Fleet has been tentatively decided as Admiral Nagano Osami. The imperial appointment ceremony will be held simultaneously with the new cabinet's imperial attestation ceremony. (1st day, Domei News Agency)

### Nagai and Nakajima Decline to Leave Their Parties

Decline to Join the Cabinet

[Tokyo] It was planned to appoint Nagai Ryutaro as the Minister of Education. However, Nagai is currently the Secretary-General of the Minseito Party, and General Hayashi asked him to leave the party as a condition for joining the cabinet. Nagai declined. Currently, Baron Kuroda Nagatoshi and Viscount Okabe Nagakage, both members of the House of Peers, will be chosen from.

Nakajima Chikuhei formally refused to assume the position of Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Hayashi Cabinet after discussions among the executives of the Seiyukai Party.

Earlier, the Seiyukai Party wanted to determine its fundamental attitude towards the Hayashi Cabinet regarding Nakajima Chikuhei's entry into the cabinet. On the afternoon of the 1st, Secretary-General Ando and President Suzuki met with former Railway Minister Maeda, exchanged opinions, and decided that Nakajima should leave the party or use any method to allow him to join the cabinet. In light of the situation, it was necessary to acknowledge it. The party's attitude towards the Hayashi Cabinet will not be to take any position as an opposition party or a party. Purely on the basis of right and wrong, they will strive to fulfill the function of a public party. Opinions have largely converged on this point. If Nakajima formally joins the cabinet, an emergency executive committee will be convened to decide on the fundamental policy. (1st day, Domei News Agency)

### Gu Weijun Meets with Polish Representative

[Geneva] The 96th session of the League of Nations Council has ended recently. The Chairman of the Council, Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to France, is still here.

The former High Commissioner, Lester, has been promoted to Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The Council recently planned to invite former Dutch Naval Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Teglaff, to succeed as High Commissioner, but Teglaff declined. Therefore, a replacement must now be found.

### Thirteen Soviet Party Prisoners Executed by Firing Squad. Rumors of Lenin's Wife Arrested

[Moscow] According to official reports, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union has decided not to grant amnesty to the thirteen defendants in the Trotskyist reactionary case who were sentenced to death. This sentence must be carried out within three days after the announcement. (1st day, Guomin News Agency)

[Moscow] Within an hour after the Soviet Executive Committee decided to reject amnesty, the thirteen defendants in the Trotskyist reactionary case who were sentenced to death were executed by firing squad at Lubyanka Prison. The execution time was 5 a.m. The executioners were twelve soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Regiment stationed in Moscow, led by Peterson, a Latvian who was very brave in the execution. Half an hour later, a truck drove out of the prison, carrying the bodies to be buried in Khodynka. The sixteen people killed in the first Trotskyist reactionary case were also buried there. (1st day, Guomin News Agency)

[London] According to news received by the Daily Mail, the thirteen defendants in the anti-revolutionary case sentenced to death by the Soviet Supreme Court were executed by firing squad at 2 a.m. today.

Warsaw. It is said that after several staff officers were arrested, Army Commissioner Voroshilov had a fierce dispute with Stalin. Stalin threatened Voroshilov with arrest, and Voroshilov replied that the Red Army was prepared to deal with such a move. (30th day, Guomin News Agency)

Mexico. After the end of the Moscow anti-revolutionary case, Trotsky, the leader of the anti-cadre faction of the Soviet Communist Party, recently told the press here that Stalin sentenced Radek, the former editor of Pravda, former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Sokolnikov, and Arnold and Stroilov to ten and eight years in prison, respectively, and spared them from death because he had concerns about world opinion. As for the other thirteen defendants, who were sentenced to death, it was to prevent the domestic people from being scattered. "In fact, all the defendants are innocent and have suffered a pitiful sacrifice under this evil political system. This system does not know what honor is, nor has it lost its conscience." As for the four defendants who were spared from death, they may be able to reveal the inside story of the case in the future. Therefore, they will soon disappear secretly, just like the disappearance of Tromon and Sukhanov, the surviving members of the Menshevik faction in 1932. (30th day, Havas News Agency)

Special Commentary

### Hitler's Speech and European Diplomacy

— Hua

Every year on important anniversaries, German leader Hitler always gives important speeches. Each time his speech has stirred up great storms in the international arena. On the 30th of last month, the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist dictatorship, Hitler gave another long speech. Now the whole world is discussing the content of this speech with the greatest concern, expressing their opinions on this speech. What expressions did these current urgent issues, such as European peace, international cooperation, the avoidance of frantic arms races, and the redistribution of the world's important resources, receive in Hitler's speech? This question is also very worthy of attention for our country, which is in the midst of international storms.

In general, the content of this speech by Hitler is about the same as before. Canceling the signature in the Treaty of Versailles acknowledging war guilt is a stimulus to the people within Germany. The strong anti-Bolshevik tone is a stimulus to the conservative forces in the international community. The declaration that there are no longer any objects of contention between Germany and France and the recognition of the permanent neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands are, on the surface, a posture of compromise. However, on important issues, such as the return of colonies, the abandonment of economic self-sufficiency in pursuit of international economic cooperation, and the prevention of frantic arms races, they are all vague or not explicitly mentioned. Regarding the peace of the whole of Europe and even the world, there is only an approximate hint, saying, "The shocking era has now come to an end." But what kind of era will follow this paragraph? It was not specifically mentioned.

Countries such as Britain, France, and the United States have all expressed a consistent disappointment in this speech. Perhaps it is a case of "the music is too sophisticated for the common ear." The only "sympathizer" is fascist Italy. Comparatively, the disappointment felt by Britain this time exceeds that of France. In a speech by Foreign Secretary Eden on the 19th of last month, he said, targeting Germany, "This world cannot be healed by agreements, treaties, and high-sounding speeches. The most important thing is the will to cooperate, and the conditions for cooperation should be: 1. Abandoning national unilateral self-interest. 2. Recognizing every country in Europe as an actual participant in solving European problems. 3. Reducing armaments to the basic level of national defense. 4. Recognizing the League of Nations as a tool for resolving international disputes." Almost none of these four points were accepted in Hitler's speech this time. Obviously, the second of these four points is now the biggest point of divergence in Anglo-German diplomacy. Since last year, Britain has made it clear that the Soviet Union cannot be excluded from solving European problems. This is also the common view of Britain and France. But Hitler resolutely refused. Therefore, according to the Haiyang News Agency, Hitler's speech specifically stated that "The differences between Eden and the Germans are insurmountable." The Reuters dispatch seems to have deliberately omitted this point. But this important diplomatic contradiction cannot be concealed.

Therefore, on the one hand, Hitler announced, "The shocking era has now come to an end." On the other hand, European cooperation and international coordination, as seen from this speech, are still forgotten in the unknowable future.

### Half Mile of Mississippi River Levee Washes Away in the United States

River Continues to Rise and Rain Is Expected; Army Prepares to Guard the Levee

Memphis. The Mississippi River, which has been controlled by riverside sluice gates for ten days, suddenly washed away half a mile of sandbag-constructed levee today at the junction of Tennessee and Kentucky, resulting in low-lying areas with a depth of seven feet. Relief workers are still unable to stop it, so the number of deaths cannot be investigated. An Associated Press reporter personally witnessed the levee collapsing, like a cork popping out of a bottle. There were 600 people trying to repair the levee there, and fortunately, they were all rescued. (31st day, Guomin News Agency)

Chicago. The Mississippi River's water level continued to rise today, threatening to destroy the dikes on both banks worth 100 million yuan. The number of people participating in disaster relief has now increased to 130,000. There are still more than one million homeless people in the disaster area. The number of victims in the southern states accounts for a quarter of the total, but the water level there has not yet reached its peak, and the Meteorological Bureau predicts that Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia will still have rain. There was an earthquake in Templeton, Tennessee, which may cause the dikes to collapse even more. However, the army commander still hopes to ensure safety. Many residents in the dangerous areas of Arkansas are unwilling to leave their homes, so the state's security forces have to use bayonets to threaten them. (31st day, Guomin News Agency)

[New York] The Mississippi River water has risen above the long levee between Cairo, Illinois and New Orleans, Louisiana. The levee is 1,200 miles long, and as rainfall is expected to continue, general anxiety has increased. The army authorities are prepared to send troops to guard the levee if necessary and assist people in leaving the Mississippi Basin. The water surge is now approaching Cairo, and the situation there is extremely tense. The flood has also flooded two feet above the 60-foot-high seawall. However, it is not entirely hopeless to avoid flooding in that area. Relief work in Louisville, Kentucky, is currently unable to proceed because of fears of an epidemic, and refugees are not allowed to return to their hometowns. However, it is gratifying that the water level upstream is gradually receding. The Federal Flood Committee is now trying to prevent flooding of the Ohio River and its tributaries. Experts estimate that the flooding of the river has washed away approximately 300 million tons of fertile soil. (1st day, Central News Agency, Reuters)

[New York] The Ohio River water is now rising very rapidly, and rescue workers are still struggling to build the long dikes. The weather in the disaster area has suddenly turned severely cold, and the millions of homeless victims are in an increasingly miserable situation. The temporary flood control dike in Cairo, which is only 18 inches away from the flood, has prompted the local mayor to order 1,500 women and children to leave the country first and install sirens to provide immediate warning in the event of dike collapse.

[San Francisco] A representative of the Pacific Shipping Association told an Associated Press reporter today that he hoped to officially resume shipping within this week. The first ship can be launched in four or five days. Union workers are now holding a re-vote on the conditions for resuming work. The majority will be able to agree to resume work. Some unions have already started voting, and the remaining unions can also start voting on Monday. (31st day, Guomin News Agency)

### Hitler's Speech: Britain Requests Several Clarifications

French Minister of War Daladier's Speech: Reaching Out for Peace, But Not Begging

[London] Regarding the speech given yesterday by the German leader Hitler, those in charge here have stated that the British government intends to request clarification through diplomatic channels, especially on the following points:

㊀ The demand for the restoration of colonies, which appears to be directed at Britain.

㊁ The issue of ethnic minorities.

㊂ The issue of anti-Bolshevism, specifically regarding the German ethnic minority issue within Czechoslovakia. The British government intends to inquire of the German government whether German-Czech relations can be improved if the Czech government resolves the issue within the bounds of the constitution. Regarding the attacks on Bolshevism made by Hitler, specifically whether the resolution of European issues must exclude Soviet Russia, British political figures have stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Prime Minister Léon Blum, and Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland, in their joint communiqué issued after their meeting in London in July of last year, stated that "If a general solution is to be achieved, all relevant countries must cooperate freely to succeed." The British government still adheres to this statement. (Havas dispatch, 1st)

Avignon, France: French Minister of National Defense Daladier recently delivered a speech here, stating, "The policy we have adopted is very frank, which is to reach out for friendship. Our nation is eager to eliminate war, and thus extends a sincere hand, hoping to cooperate with other countries. However, this expression is aimed at organizing world peace and engaging in construction, not at fawning and begging others. This is what the world should know." (Havas dispatch, 31st)

[London] This morning, London newspapers regarded Hitler's speech last Saturday as largely passive, and expressed disappointment at the lack of concrete proposals regarding how Germany would maintain peace in Europe in the future. The Daily Telegraph stated that in terms of concrete methods for resolving European difficulties, whether politically or economically, the situation today is no different from before. The newspaper added that the alarming period has now passed. If Germany's true goal is peace, then what Germany should do is abandon empty rhetoric and simply suggest what steps can be taken to establish a solid and unshakable foundation for European peace. The Morning Post stated that although Hitler delivered eloquent words on diplomatic matters, practically speaking, there was nothing concrete that the world knows.

The Daily Mail expressed the same view, stating that Mr. Hitler's remarks, from beginning to end, were vague and ambiguous, and added that if Mr. Hitler does not want the world to suspect that his vague words conceal a concrete plan for future aggression, he should give his peaceful sentiments a more practical form.

In addition, the Daily Mail stated that Hitler's speech should be carefully considered by all British politicians, because some German colonies were allocated to British territories as mandates after the war, and are not under the direct rule of the British government. The future status of these colonies is worthy of deep consideration by the British people. The Times stated that Mr. Hitler's speech has had a stabilizing and conciliatory effect, but how to maintain and expand this effect depends on how future negotiations begin. If Germany can respond to Britain's previous Locarno notification, it would be a starting point for future negotiations. The thread of negotiation is not entirely in British hands, but the British can make two contributions to security and reconciliation: one is the rapid completion of British national defense, and the other is to do its best to implement economic policies for current international needs. If Germany does not want to isolate itself, Britain does not want to exclude it. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st, Reuter)

[London] The Liberal Party's News Chronicle reported, "Although Hitler said that the era of shock and horror has come to an end, unfortunately, the era of cooperation has apparently not yet begun. At least, as far as the Spanish issue is concerned, Germany still has an open path to rein in its horses and retreat from the rapids. This is somewhat satisfactory." (Havas dispatch, 1st)

### German Officers in Spanish Rebel Army Make Insulting Remarks

Causing a Riot and Several Deaths

[London] A Daily Express dispatch from Gibraltar reports that in Seville, German officers made insulting remarks to the Spanish rebel army, causing a riot in which several Spaniards were shot and killed. After this incident was reported to rebel commander General Franco, Franco ordered General Mola to deny via radio broadcast that there were German officers in the rebel army. (National Telegram, 31st)

Madrid: The National Defense Committee is currently actively carrying out the evacuation of residents. In the past ten days, a total of 60,000 people have followed orders to evacuate. However, this number is still less than the planned quota, because the people of Madrid are mostly reluctant to leave their homes. The authorities have had to post notices, and use radio broadcasts and newspaper advertisements to persuade them, which can be said to be a painstaking effort. At this moment, residents are still hesitating, and those who inquire about details from the evacuation affairs bureau are still numerous. These people are particularly concerned about whether they can carry furniture. (Havas dispatch, 1st)

Avila: From today, the Nationalist authorities intend to issue an order within their jurisdiction to levy an additional tax of 10% on the sale of tobacco and spices, the business income of entertainment venues, and the extra food and drink in hotels and cafes, and use the proceeds to provide relief to the families of soldiers at the front. (Havas dispatch, 1st)

### British House of Commons Discusses Canton-Hankow Railway

Bond Interest Arrears

[London] During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Conservative Party MP Molson, saying that he knew that negotiations between the Chinese government and the holders of Canton-Hankow Railway bonds regarding the issuance of arrears of bond interest were currently underway, but he was unable to provide any information at this time. Molson also asked whether it was true that the British, French, and German holders of these bonds had expressed satisfaction with the Chinese government's proposal, but negotiations were currently stalled due to objections from the American representative. The Foreign Secretary replied that he did not know about this matter. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st, Reuter)

### Nobel Prize Committee Expresses Dissatisfaction with Germany

Stockholm, Sweden: German leader Hitler announced yesterday in the Reichstag that he had ordered to prohibit German people from receiving Nobel Prizes. The members of the Nobel Prize Committee are deeply regretful about this, and say that this move is very harmful to Germany. Professor Siegbahn, director of the physics division of the committee, stated, "Although the German government can prohibit its people from accepting prizes, it cannot prevent the Nobel Committee from awarding prizes to the German people." Professor Holmgren, director of the medicine division, also stated, "This prohibition only puts Germany in a more unfavorable position." In addition, newspapers expressed surprise or indignation at Hitler's decision. For example, the conservative Svenska Dagbladet stated, "Hitler has now established a system of spiritual self-sufficiency, which will isolate Germany even more than economic self-sufficiency." The liberal Dagens Nyheter stated, "At a time when the world is divided, the only link between countries is cultural relations. Hitler's current actions have caused Germany to withdraw from international cultural society, and are sufficient to prove that Germany will only recognize science and art that are inherent to Germany, or are derived from National Socialism. This view is not only a reckless and destructive nationalistic idea, but also runs counter to human civilization." (Havas dispatch, 31st)

### Singapore Begins Major Naval, Land, and Air Military Exercise

Sudden Naval Attack to Test Newly Built Forts

[Singapore] This morning, the Navy launched a surprise attack on Singapore Harbor without prior warning to test the strength of the forts built at a cost of £10 million. The land defense forces resisted, while several air patrol planes flew out of the harbor to search for the "enemy's" warships and transport ships carrying the attacking forces. This major exercise, which has been in preparation for a long time, is very meticulously arranged and will last for several days. The attacking forces are commanded by Vice Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, and the defending forces are commanded by Lieutenant General Dobbie, Commander of Malaya. A total of 8,000 officers and soldiers are participating, including sailors, soldiers, air force personnel, and the troops of Johor. All the warships of the British Navy in China that can be deployed are participating in this exercise. The Air Force has two squadrons of torpedo bombers and two squadrons of flying boats, all of which are stationed in Singapore. There is also a squadron of aircraft from the aircraft carrier Hermes and squadrons of aircraft from Iraq and India. The total number is currently kept secret. The attacking navy must be 250 miles away from Singapore when the exercise begins, so it is expected that the attack on the port will be launched from the air first. People here are confident that the forts of this port will prove to be indestructible. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st, Reuter)

### Japanese to Build Eastern Border Road Longitudinal Railway from Antung

Implemented in conjunction with the Five-Year Industrial Plan, Carrying an Important National Defense Mission

Antung Correspondence: In recent years, the Japanese have made no progress on the issue of building the Eastern Border Road longitudinal railway due to the activities of the Volunteer Army and the extremely unstable security situation. Extending to the present day, the Japanese believe that with the implementation of the Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan, the Eastern Border Road, which possesses unlimited resources, has a need to build a longitudinal railway. Therefore, they ordered the puppet Antung Provincial Government to dispatch a large number of security personnel to join the Japanese army in attacking the Volunteer Army. On the one hand, they actively carried out a railway construction movement, focusing on the inseparable relationship between resource development and railway construction in the Eastern Border Road included in the Five-Year Industrial Plan. Recently, they have also actively approached the Kwantung Army and the South Manchuria Railway for assistance, and have obtained their agreement to the plan, accelerating its realization. Surveying has now begun, and construction will begin as soon as the weather warms up. The Japanese believe that its future is promising. It is also claimed that the railway, starting from Antung, passing through Kuandian, Huanren, Tonghua, Linjiang, and through the puppet Jiandao Province, will run through Dongning, carrying out the national policy mission of both developing industry and important national defense. This differs somewhat from the route previously planned by the Japanese during their passive period.

### General Situation of Land Administration in Nanking City

Two Important Tasks Completed Last Year, This Year's Implementation Plan Also Determined

Nanking Correspondence: In order to expedite land registration, the Nanking Municipal Government restored the Land Bureau in July of the 24th year (renamed the Land Administration Bureau in June of the 25th year). At that time, it still followed the original application deadline, with the end of the 24th year as the deadline. On the one hand, it urged households to apply within the deadline, and on the other hand, it stepped up the handling of backlog registration cases. From the 25th year onwards, since the application deadline had expired, it formulated provisional registration measures to promote the completion of registration, and actively prepared for land tax, preparing to levy land value tax in the 25th year. In addition, matters stipulated in the Land Law, such as land consolidation and wasteland reclamation, were also planned and implemented separately. It is now known that the city's Land Administration Bureau has generally completed the two important tasks of handling land registration and preparing for land tax by the end of the 25th year. Other land administration matters have also been handled separately. The general situation of the bureau's work in the 25th year is described below to show a glimpse of land administration in Nanking City.

Land Registration

The land registration of the urban area and Xiaguan Pukou in Nanking City stipulates that the end of the 24th year is the application deadline. Starting from the 25th year, in order to urge households to apply and complete registration, special provisional registration measures were formulated and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. The content of the measures stipulates that those who fail to apply for registration after the deadline will be subject to provisional ownership registration by the Land Administration Bureau according to the provisional registration measures, and a public announcement will be made for three months. If no one objects after the deadline, the provisional registration will be considered confirmed, and the Land Administration Bureau will provisionally take over. During the provisional takeover period, if the original owner requests to restore ownership, and the application for supplementary registration is approved, a penalty of one-tenth of the registered property value must be paid. One year after the provisional takeover is completed, the Land Administration Bureau will formally take over, which is regarded as the implementation of the city's land provisional registration measures. Those who previously hoped to evade and those who failed to fulfill registration due to obstacles have begun to apply for supplementary registration one after another. In addition, regarding the registration of foreign church perpetual lease land properties, because the situation is different from ordinary land registration, the bureau also separately formulated perpetual lease land registration measures, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and began to handle perpetual lease land registration in September of the 25th year. As of the end of the 25th year, the bureau had received a total of 22,112 cases of public and private land ownership registration applications, 2,766 cases of provisional registration, 98 cases of perpetual lease registration, 9,258 cases of other rights registration, and 672 cases of transfer and change registration. After legal review, 28,712 cases were approved and announced. The above figures are tabulated as follows:

According to the figures in the table, there are still more than 2,000 cases of ownership registration that have not been confirmed. According to the person in charge of the bureau, these unconfirmed cases are all due to property disputes and lawsuits filed in court. Registration can only be carried out after a judgment. Therefore, except for these cases, the land registration in the urban area and Xiaguan Pukou has been generally completed, and the registration book and cadastral book have also been compiled and ready. In addition to the urban area and Xiaguan Pukou, Nanking City also has more than 600,000 mu of rural land that has not been surveyed and registered. The City Land Administration Bureau has submitted a set of rural land aerial surveying measures and rural land registration measures to the Municipal Government for approval, preparing to implement them in the 26th year in order. When opening rural registration, the bureau plans to add personnel to the rural affairs office set up by the municipal government to handle rural land registration matters in a permanent office, in order to make it simple and easy.

Land Tax Rate

In the 25th year, the city accelerated the completion of general registration on the one hand, and actively planned the land tax on the other hand. In March, it first sent personnel to Hangzhou, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other cities to investigate the situation of collecting land value tax for reference. In June, the Land Bureau was changed to the Land Administration Bureau, and a land tax section was added to specialize in preparing for land value tax matters. First, it started to find out the land use situation and compile the types of tax land, and then formulated the land value tax rate and submitted it to the Municipal Government for submission to the Municipal Council for revision and approval. In July, the Executive Yuan approved the tax rate as follows:

㊀ City improved land (A) Construction land: 14 per mille of the estimated value shall be taxed annually. (B) Agricultural land: 10 per mille of the estimated value shall be taxed annually.

㊁ City unimproved land: 25 per mille of the estimated value shall be taxed annually.

㊂ Wasteland: 40 per mille of the estimated value shall be taxed annually.

㊃ Political districts and restricted construction areas: 10 per mille of the estimated value shall be taxed annually. (To be continued)

### Kunshan

Hongkang Steamer Fined for Violation

The Hongkang steamer, which runs between Changshu and Shanghai, towed twelve cotton boats on the night of the 29th of last month and passed through this county from Changshu. The Public Security Bureau detained the steamer because it violated the regulations on river steamer control, and detained the boss, Zhang Jingfu, and sent him to the county government, which sentenced him to a fine of 50 yuan. The Suzhou Sub-Customs of the Jianghai Customs learned of this and, because the steamer did not have a designated route for inland rivers, it violated the Customs' regulations, and sent Li [blank] and Zhang Yangshu to the county to investigate the truth in order to deal with it according to the regulations.

Police Bureau Reorganized and Established

The Public Security Bureau of this county was reorganized into a Police Bureau starting on the 1st. The General Bureau has three sections: General Affairs, Administration, and Justice. All branch bureaus and offices are changed to police stations. The Special Task Force is renamed the Security Police Force. The number of police officers, salaries, and public funds remain the same, and it has been reported for record.

### Kiangyin

Public Security Bureau Changes to Police Bureau

The County Public Security Bureau was ordered to change its name to the Police Bureau on the 1st. Its organization is handled in accordance with the organizational regulations of the county police organs promulgated by the Ministry. The original one, two, and three sections were changed to one, two, and three departments. The original branch bureaus and sub-stations were renamed police branch bureaus and sub-stations. All bureau flags and collar badges were also made and used by the Inspectorate.

### Nantong

Two Thousand Drug Offenders Arrested

Tongyi is carrying out a general re-investigation of drug abuse. Public officials and police teams from urban and rural areas are conducting a comprehensive search of households along the roads. As of the end of January, a total of more than 2,100 male and female offenders have been arrested. County magistrates Zhang and Dong, both military judges, have been interrogating them day and night, and all detention centers are full.

### Wenchow

Lack of Silver Coins on the Market

In Chumen Town, the 3rd district of Yuhuan, the double-hao silver coins circulating in the market have been gradually lacking recently due to the smuggling and transportation by unscrupulous merchants. Even the small-scale transactions of three or four cents on the market are difficult. The financial system is out of balance, and merchants and residents are very panicked.

### Changshu

Rescuing Innocent People Arrested

This county has been ordered to conduct a general re-investigation of opium addicts, with a deadline of the evening of the 30th. The number of unlicensed opium smokers found through the investigation reached more than 900, who are now being detained in hospitals for examination and in detention centers. However, among these more than 900 people, there are many law-abiding people who do not smoke opium, which has caused opposition from society. The reason for this phenomenon is that Chao Jiamei, a provincial commissioner, came to Changshu and believed that the results of the investigation in this county were not good, and that the number of people arrested was not as large as in neighboring counties. He specially ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest 1,000 people within two days. Therefore, when the Public Security Bureau sent out the police, it also strictly instructed each policeman to arrest five people every day, and each patrol officer to arrest 30 people. The police officers simply searched the streets and alleys and public places, and anyone with a pale yellow face was considered suspicious, tied up, and sent to the county, and then sent to the hospital for examination. Regardless of whether they had drugs or not, they all had to undergo a one-week examination period before they could be discharged from the hospital. As a result, more than 600 people were arrested in two days. The strangest thing is that 12 ordinary patients in the private Shuliang Hospital were arrested because of their poor appearance, and three people were arrested in the Yuhe Hospital. Such a search has made men and women with slight illness afraid to go out. The Changshu County Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter affects social stability and indirectly affects the business market. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching, and all parties will suffer losses together. On the 30th, it specially united with the Education Association, the County Farmers' Association, and the Women's Association to send a telegram to the province requesting that the county handle the matter carefully. Local gentry He Liangshi, Yu Jiushi, Cao Shiliu, and others also met with the county magistrate, requesting that he order his subordinates to correct the situation and find a way to have those who were definitely not opium smokers released by the township chiefs, so as to avoid economic, spiritual, and reputational losses.

### Chekiang Provincial Telephone Bureau Completes the Installation of Carrier Wave Telephone

Hangzhou-Wenzhou Line Open for Calls from the 1st

Hangzhou Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau has completed the installation of the carrier wave telephone on the Hangzhou-Wenzhou line, and it will be open for calls from February 1st. The bureau held a telephone call ceremony in the reception room at 3 pm yesterday (the 1st). Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department Director Wang presided over the meeting. Guests included Zhejiang Security Department Director Xuan Tiewu, Zhejiang Telecommunications Administration Bureau Director Zhu Chongguang, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau Deputy Director Wu Jingqing, Hangzhou County Magistrate Ye Fenghu, Legislator Ma Yinchu, Zhejiang Postal Director Simis, reporter Liu Zirun, and more than 50 others. Director Wang first gave an opening speech, followed by Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, who reported on the project's preparation process. Director Xuan, Director Zhu, Deputy Director Wu, and County Magistrate Ye, among other guests, then delivered speeches. After the speeches, test calls were made, and the results were exceptionally satisfactory. The guests all praised the project. The meeting adjourned at around 5 pm. The function of carrier wave telephone is to enable one line to have the function of more than two lines. Compared to adding lines, it can not only save costs, but also make the sound transmission clearer and louder. The bureau, in view of the busy telephone traffic on the Hangzhou-Wenzhou line, specially installed this equipment. It is still a pioneering effort in the country. The Hangzhou-Ningbo line will also continue to be set up in the future, which will greatly benefit the transmission of audio information.

### Revised Men's Basketball Rules for 1936-1937

Published Translation by the All-China Athletic Federation

The All-China Athletic Federation has published the revisions to the 1936-37 Men's Basketball Rules. The rules have not changed much this season, but there have been some modifications to wording and additional explanations. The American English book was originally expected to arrive in Shanghai in November of last year, but due to the postal ship sailors' strike, it was only received last week. To meet domestic needs, a preliminary translation is being published for reference. However, the official rule book will be printed and published after review and correction by the Rules Review Committee.

(Note) The basketball rules used in our country are based on the articles approved by the American National Basketball Committee. However, the rules approved by the committee this season are slightly different from those of the Amateur Athletic Union (A·A·U·). The new rules adopted in Shanghai this season are only a summary of those approved by the (A·A·U.) (The YMCA all adopt A·A·U· rules.) It is now understood that the reduction in the effective area of the three-second rule for players in the frontcourt is a change made by the Amateur Athletic Union of America. The rules of the American National Basketball Committee have not been changed and remain the same as those used last year (i.e., the entire free throw area). As our country's rules adopt those approved by the American National Basketball Committee, this article should also be in accordance with the committee's regulations and should not be changed. This is specially stated for the attention of all parties. The revised articles are as follows:

Chapter 1, Article 3: A circle with a radius of six feet should be added to the center of the court to prevent crowding during the center jump. A new section is added after this article as follows:

"Concentric with the center circle, another circle with a radius of six feet should be drawn with a two-inch wide line. The length of the line drawn for this radius should be calculated to the outside of the circle."

Chapter 1, Article 6: It is noted that the distance from the outside of the free throw line to the inside of the end line is seventeen feet. This does not need to be changed on existing courts. It should be applied to newly drawn or redrawn courts.

Chapter 5, Article 3: There are revised instructions for substitution procedures. Because substitutes can speak with others upon entering the court, the section in the annotation "for the convenience of players identifying their opponents..." is worded as follows:

"Before entering the court, the substitute should first report their name, number, and position to the scorer. When the game becomes a dead ball, the scorer should sound the whistle to notify the officials. The substitute should receive instructions from the officials before entering the court and reporting their name or number and the name or number of the player being replaced."

Chapter 6, Article 4: Delete the annotation and incorporate it into Article 12 of the text.

Chapter 6, Article 7: Add a sentence to indicate the duties of the officials, worded as follows:

In the event of "delay during the game, such as the ball getting stuck on the basket or rolling under the stands, the official may declare a timeout and deduct the wasted time."

Chapter 6, Article 9: Add a sentence to clarify the rule for a jump ball committed by both teams simultaneously, worded as follows:

"If both teams commit a jump ball rule violation at the same time, unless the official deems it a serious offense deserving of a technical foul, a jump ball should be performed again."

Chapter 6, Articles 12 and 13 have been completely revised, providing more accurate guidance on the duties of scorers and timers. The methods described are suitable for experienced scorers and timers to try. The full text is as follows:

(Article 12) "The scorer should record the number of successful field goals, the number of successful and missed free throws, and keep a running total of the score.

The scorer should record the number of technical and personal fouls assessed to each player. Any player who commits a fourth personal foul should be reported to the referee immediately.

The scorer should record the number of "timeouts" requested by each team. After any team has requested more than four timeouts, each subsequent request should be reported to the nearest official.

The home team's scorebook should be considered the official scorebook unless the referee specifies otherwise. After each successful field goal, foul, or timeout request, the scorers should cross-check their records. If any discrepancies are found, they should be reported to the referee immediately. If the referee is unable to correct the error, the record in the official scorebook shall prevail. The scorer should record the names, numbers, and positions of the players at the start of the game and of substitutes during the game. If any discrepancies are found in the team roster, substitution procedures, or player numbers during a dead ball, the scorer should report it to the nearest official immediately. If it is discovered during the game, it should be reported immediately when the game becomes a dead ball.

The scorer should have a whistle to use to notify officials during dead balls. The sound of the whistle should be different from those used by the officials and timers. After a substitute has reported, the scorer should sound the whistle when the game becomes a dead ball, signaling that the substitute should stand outside the court line until receiving the official's signal to enter the game.

(Note) Scorers may use the following method to record fouls and successful/missed field goals and free throws:

P1 P2... indicates the number of personal fouls, T indicates a technical foul, 2 indicates a field goal, ○ indicates a free throw, ○ with an × inside indicates a successful free throw, (to be continued)

### Second Ping Municipal Ice Games

### Pacific Coast Basketball All-Stars to Arrive in Shanghai on the 5th

To Play Shanghai Chinese-Western Mixed Team at 7 PM That Evening; Tickets Sold at Shen Garden for $1.50 Each

The Pacific Coast All-Stars basketball team, composed of players from various universities in Southern California, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this Friday (the 5th) and play against a mixed Chinese-Western team from this city at the Shen Garden basketball hall on Yanping Road at 7:00 PM that evening. After the game, they will board the original ship and depart for Japan. Details are as follows:

Negotiations

The team passed through Shanghai several weeks ago but only stayed for a few hours before leaving for the Philippines, so few people were aware of their presence. This time, the arrangements for the match in Shanghai were negotiated by Mr. Zhang Guoxun, a famous basketball referee and sports editor for the Continental Daily News, and the All-China Athletic Federation. The mixed Chinese-Western team from this city will consist of the best players from Shanghai. If basketball stars from Nanjing can come to Shanghai to participate, the Shanghai team's strength will be greatly increased. Captaincy has been assigned to Ka'er, who, together with Mr. Zhou Jiaqi of the Athletic Federation, is responsible for selecting players and contacting Mr. Li Zhenzhong, the center from the Tianjin-Beijing area, to come to Shanghai to help in the game.

Tickets on Sale Tomorrow

The match is scheduled to be held at 7:00 PM this Friday evening at the Shen Garden basketball hall on Yanping Road. After deducting expenses, the proceeds from ticket sales will be used by the Continental Daily News to purchase prizes to encourage sports competitions in this city. However, the costs for this event, including hospitality, are considerable. To help with expenses and avoid overcrowding, each ticket will be sold for $1.50. Seating is on a first-come, first-served basis, with no reserved seats. Although the price has been increased, it is very reasonable considering the opportunity to appreciate such high-level basketball skills and the charitable nature of the event. Tickets will go on sale one day in advance (Thursday). The locations for ticket sales will be announced in local newspapers tomorrow.

Team Roster

In the Philippines, the team won all but one game, losing 39-40 to the San Beda team. They also defeated the Philippine National Champions, Santo Tomas, 38-19, demonstrating their superior skill. The team includes Browning (6 feet 2 inches tall, playing right forward), who has served as captain of the University of California basketball team three times, as well as Curbow, Hougell, Beall, Moss, Mcfadden of Los Angeles, Weidtisga, and Don Kimeng, the former Shanghai Haiwo University basketball representative, and seven others. Shi Hengsheng, a member of the US team at the World Games last autumn, did not travel with the team due to illness.

### Shen Garden Basketball

Yesterday's Results

In the first game of the evening at the Shanghai Basketball Association, Nan Qing played Qi Dui. In the first half, the two teams initially went their own ways, with scores rising alternately. Then, Qi Dui's defense became slightly lax, and Nan Qing's Yang Zhu scored repeatedly, taking a lead of 18-11. In the second half, Qi Dui rallied and tied the score, but then fell behind again. In the last four minutes, Qi Dui's Lu Zheng'er Feng scored four consecutive goals, leading his team to a 40-32 victory.

Qing Guang Dui is a team composed of veterans who have maintained their prowess throughout their run. Although Qun Yi are rising stars, they struggled to compete and were down 19-10 at halftime. After the break, Qu Xianzhu of Qun Yi suffered a foot cramp and had to leave the game. With no substitutes available, his team had to play with only four players. In the face of such a disadvantage, Qun Yi was able to play freely. Although Qu re-entered the game later, the loss was too great, and Qun Yi lost 33-28.

Carrier wave equipment was also installed on the long-distance telephone line between Shanghai and Suzhou starting yesterday. Details are as follows:

Shanghai-Hong Kong Phone Calls Yesterday

Long-distance wireless telephone service between Shanghai and Hong Kong officially began yesterday morning. At 6:00 AM, Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer, conducted a test call with the Hong Kong Telephone Company. The sound was very clear. Subsequently, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, Peng Xuepei, Vice Minister of Transportation, Feng Youzhen, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, and Zhang Shile, President of the Far East Branch of Reuters, spoke with Sir Grantham, Governor of Hong Kong, exchanging congratulations.

Mayor Wu's Congratulatory Remarks

Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng conveyed his congratulations to Hong Kong Governor Sir Grantham, stating, "Hong Kong and Shanghai are separated by a vast ocean. The establishment of telephone service between Shanghai and Hong Kong shortens the distance between the two places, not only further strengthening close ties in Sino-British commerce but also greatly impacting Sino-British relations. From now on, we can exchange news and deepen friendship. I sincerely wish Your Excellency good health and wish that Sino-British relations continue to improve."

Vice Minister Peng's Congratulatory Remarks

Vice Minister of Transportation Peng conveyed his congratulations to Hong Kong Governor Sir Grantham, stating, "Today marks the opening of long-distance telephone service between Shanghai and Hong Kong. I, the Vice Minister, extend my sincere congratulations to Your Excellency. The business relationship between the two major cities of Shanghai and Hong Kong has always been important. Therefore, all parties have long anticipated this new communication tool. Since the establishment of wireless telephone service between Shanghai and Guangzhou last December, the foundation for direct communication between Shanghai and Hong Kong has been laid because Guangzhou and Hong Kong already have long-distance telephone connections. Thanks to your cooperation, we are able to jointly celebrate the opening of this new circuit today. I firmly believe that this circuit will become very developed in the future and will greatly contribute to the prosperity of Shanghai and Hong Kong. I take this opportunity to wish Your Excellency good health and the prosperity of the city of Hong Kong."

Mutual Congratulations Among the News Media

Feng Youzhen, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, spoke with Zhou Yesun, Director of the Hong Kong Branch of the Central News Agency, saying, "Today, on the occasion of the commencement of telephone service between Shanghai and Hong Kong, the news media in Shanghai and the news media in your area are jointly celebrating the success of this circuit. Shanghai and Hong Kong are both important commercial ports in the Far East, and the news industries in both places have rapidly developed. The success of this circuit makes the flow of information more rapid and convenient, which is beneficial to the news industry in both places. I take this opportunity to wish my colleagues in the news industry in your area good health and wish your news industry continued progress." Subsequently, Zhang Shile, President of the Far East Branch of Reuters, and Hong Kong Governor Sir Grantham exchanged congratulations on the success of this new circuit and wished each other good health.

Shanghai-Hunan Phone Calls Also

Long-distance wireless telephone service between Shanghai and Changsha and Yueyang in Hunan Province also officially began yesterday morning. Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer, went to the Zhabei Wireless Radio Station at 6:00 AM to conduct a test call with the directors of the telephone bureaus in Changsha and Yueyang in Hunan Province. The results were excellent and then officially opened to service.

Shanghai-Suzhou Increases Equipment

The long-distance telephone between Shanghai and Suzhou originally had two direct lines. However, recently, because long-distance telephone calls from Wujiang, Pingwang, and other places to Shanghai all had to be transferred through Suzhou, the volume of telephone traffic between Shanghai and Suzhou became even busier. The original two direct lines were insufficient to meet demand. Therefore, with the approval of the Ministry of Transportation, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau installed carrier wave equipment at both the Shanghai and Suzhou telephone bureaus. This equipment is not only inexpensive, but also increases efficiency. Starting yesterday morning, four people can have conversations simultaneously.

### Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Foreign Affairs Requesting the Enactment of a Sino-Philippine Reciprocal Trade Treaty

Philippine Independence Achieved; This Case Cannot Be Delayed

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "To the esteemed Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry in Nanjing: On the 30th of this month, the Yangzhuang Straw Hat Industry Association wrote stating that the gold silk straw hats that our members export to Europe and America are woven by the people of Lvzhe'er Province, while the gold silk raw material used is a specialty of the Philippines. Because Filipinos' own gold silk straw hats have inferior techniques and higher prices, sales are difficult to compete with Chinese products. Therefore, in October of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Philippine Congress enacted a law prohibiting the export of gold silk grass. The Philippine government establishes a company to purchase surplus gold silk grass for its own use, and uses methods of deferred storage to prevent the quality of the grass from becoming brittle due to prolonged storage. This desire to monopolize raw materials makes it impossible for us to compete. Our members are suffering the evil consequences of total destruction, and the livelihood of hat-weaving people is also hopeless. The severity and urgency of the situation are self-evident. The view of this association is that although the Philippine Islands have established an autonomous government, the laws passed by the Philippine Congress must still be submitted to the motherland, the United States, for final approval by the President of the United States within six months until complete independence. Therefore, the identified negotiation target is the United States, not the Philippines. Therefore, on October 22 of the 25th year of the Republic of China, we sent a detailed letter to your association describing the ins and outs of this case, requesting your association to forward it to the Ministries of Industry and Foreign Affairs, and conduct negotiations based on the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, in order to achieve the goal of mediation. Since receiving the forwarded letter and the ministry's reply, several months have passed, and the industry is very anxious because the news of the progress of the negotiations has been silent. This association, after brainstorming, obtained the suggestion of experts, and deeply felt that the previous proposal for negotiations based on the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was not appropriate, and it was necessary to change the course, abandoning the superficial and treating the root cause. The question of whether or not a country should prohibit the export of goods is a matter of that country's internal affairs. Except when our country did not understand foreign affairs during trade and bound itself, other countries rarely have such examples. Now that our country's tariff sovereignty has been restored, this kind of constraint has also been lifted. It can be seen that there is no treaty suitable for relying on the Sino-American Commercial Treaty for negotiation. Moreover, the Sino-American Commercial Treaty of the 29th year of Guangxu Dynasty has many loopholes and biases, making it difficult to win. Therefore, after submitting the request for negotiation, this association has repeatedly studied the crux of this case. Now we present to your association our limited knowledge and what we have learned from those familiar with the Philippine situation. According to Philippine customs statistics on foreign trade, from 1899 to 1933, only 12 of these 35 years had import surpluses, while the remaining 23 years had export surpluses. Examining the countries with export surpluses, except for Spain and France having a small number of export surpluses, the huge amount of export surpluses almost entirely belonged to the United States. The trade with other foreign countries was entirely import surpluses, especially with China, Japan, England, and Germany. Observers say that the Philippines entirely uses its export surpluses to the United States to make up for its import surpluses in foreign trade. The reason why it can uniquely have export surpluses to the United States is because it belongs to the same currency zone. Imports are not subject to import taxes, and there are no import quantity restrictions, allowing free development. However, time flies, and the ten-year period of Philippine independence is approaching. This free trade system will soon change, which will have a significant impact on the national economy. In order to maintain economic survival, it will inevitably have to preserve raw materials and revitalize industry, in order to open up a new outlet for sales. Its prohibition of gold silk grass exports is almost tied to national policy. Even if the United States has the right to reject it, it may be difficult to fulfill our wishes and proceed unimpeded. Observing the Philippine nation's repeated proposals to prohibit foreigners from establishing retail stores in recent years, one can glimpse one of its long-term considerations. Therefore, after independence, the Philippines will inevitably seek a place to dispose of its main exports because it has lost the path of free trade with the United States. Our country is separated by water, no different from a strip of clothing, and is naturally the point of its attention. In the current situation, we have needs from the Philippines, and the Philippines also has needs from us. Therefore, our government should seize this opportunity to negotiate a reciprocal commercial treaty with it, so that the rights of this case and the protection of overseas Chinese in the Philippines can be included as an annex in the future. Japan has special commercial treaties with India and Australia, and our country has precedents for special treaties with French Vietnam and British Burma. Given the importance of Sino-Philippine relations, the act of concluding a treaty should not be delayed. Therefore, the most urgent plan at present should be for the Ministries of Industry and Foreign Affairs to instruct the ambassadors to the United States and the consuls-general to the Philippines to initiate proposals and strive for success, so that what this association expects can be solved easily. This matter concerns the protection of industry and commerce. We earnestly request your association to continue to forward the situation to the Ministries of Industry and Foreign Affairs, adopt and implement it for the public convenience. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, 30th."

"This matter was previously reported to your ministry via a telegraphic request on October 24th of last year based on the letter from the association, requesting your ministry to negotiate for the lifting of the ban. There has been no progress so far, which has a significant impact on the industry's hat-making raw materials. The suggestions in the continuing letter are not without merit. It is reasonable to present this to your ministry for review and approval, and to adopt and implement it for the public convenience. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, 30th."

### Gao Yuzhu, Representative of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities Petition, Will Return South

Hoping for Development by Compatriots in the Interior; Zhang Yaozeng and Others Will Host a Banquet Tomorrow

Ms. Gao Yuzhu, representative of the southwestern ethnic minority chieftains and people, is a hereditary Guofan and has the responsibility of protecting the land. In view of the aggression of British and French forces in the local area, and the oppression of local warlords and corrupt officials, she led a delegation of more than ten ethnic minorities to Beijing in April of last year to petition the central authorities to send an envoy and investigation team to organize ethnic affairs in order to strengthen the border defense. She was received by Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, Ms. Song Meiling Chiang, and important central officials. Now that the matter is over, she has been ordered to return south and has arrived in Shanghai, welcoming compatriots in the interior to develop the area and reporting on the customs, culture, politics, and affairs of the ethnic areas, hoping that those who pay attention to border defense will provide assistance to avoid foreigners taking advantage of the opportunity to covet the area and create another tragedy like the Northeast. Ms. Gao went to France at an early age and is the hereditary Tusi of Beisheng in Yunnan, a descendant of Gao Shengtai, King of Dali during the Tang Dynasty.

### Detailed Record of the Literary and Art Circle Symposium (Continued)

Pan Jiemin: I have some comments on this declaration. Unifying the country to save it is necessary, but it lacks explanation. Our attitude seems to need some supplementation. I think two points should be added to the declaration: First, resisting aggression; second, eliminating traitors. These two points should be added.

Wang Fuquan: I have some comments on organizing a literary and art association. I have participated in the union and the fraternity twice in the past. The first time was before September 18th, and the second time was during January 28th. Neither of these two times had any results. The first time, only one meeting was held and then it was over. The second time was a little better, it lasted for more than a month, but later, because all members had to go to the front lines to assist, and these scholars couldn't do it, it disbanded. Regarding the literary and art association, as long as everyone overcomes individualism to a certain extent, it is not impossible to organize. If the right-leaning members of the second union I participated in had overcome individualism a little, it might not have been disbanded. As for abandoning politics, that is impossible. Our declaration of unifying the country to save it is a political stance. However, unifying the country to save it is correct. We should unite and organize under the banner of unifying the country to save it. In this association, we should all work together to unify the country and save it. Outside the association, if individuals have their own political stance, it has nothing to do with the association. Such an organization is possible.

Xu Beichen: I just heard several gentlemen talk about the left and right factions, and I would also like to say a few words. Whether the so-called left and right factions can be established is a fundamental question. Some people think that the right faction seems to be backward, and the left faction seems to be progressive and glorious. If this is really the case, the left faction is progressive and revolutionary, and it seems that we should support them. But in reality, its danger is quite alarming. Where is this danger? They think that those who are satisfied with the status quo are not writers, and those who are dissatisfied with the status quo are good writers. Of course, if we are satisfied with the status quo, society will not progress, but it is a wrong view to want to fundamentally destroy the status quo because of dissatisfaction with the status quo. In the current serious situation of China, we should stand on the position of the people and seek survival for the entire Chinese nation. Based on this principle, there should be no so-called left and right factions. I have seen so-called left-wing publications saying that the central army's arrival in Sui hinders resistance to the enemy. Coincidentally, I have several friends in the central army, and they wrote to say that it is very cold there and they are fighting heroically. I don't know what the left-wing publications are intentionally spreading rumors about. I also saw a Wuxi newsletter in a certain publication run by Zou Taofen, saying that our army did not go to resist the enemy, but went to Wuxi to build roads, causing the villagers to have no homes to return to. This kind of complaint about the army is very naive. If we formally declare war on the enemy, will the entire China fight the enemy, or will only Shanhaiguan fight the enemy? Everyone knows that it is the entire battle. Since it is the entire battle, how can all places not prepare in advance? From this, it can be seen that what the so-called left-wing says is irresponsible, but the result is to confuse the audience first, so I say the danger is very great. Now, let's get back to the point. If we want to organize a literary and art association, then as long as the government seeks survival for the Chinese nation, everyone should support it. All prejudices should be put aside.

Ma Zihua: The left faction has the left faction's thoughts. I don't want to talk about the left and right factions again in today's meeting. China now needs to unify the country to save it, and should not be divided into left and right factions. True patriots should unite with each other and bring out the power of unifying the country to save it. Where does this power come from? Power comes from organization, so I strongly agree with organizing a literary and art association.

Fang Zhi: I have another appointment at this time, so I want to take a step first. Before I leave, I have a little opinion to offer to everyone. First, our literary and art circles should indeed organize. It is not only necessary to organize for the sake of the literary and art circles themselves, but it is also necessary to organize for the sake of saving the country. I hope that the result of today's talks can produce a sound organization. Once organized, the power will be concentrated, and there will be no so-called factions. After the organization is done, we should meet often and exchange opinions often. All misunderstandings can be explained, and from then on, we can work hard to save the country and seek the development of culture. Second, unifying the country to save it is to save China with the collective strength of the entire Chinese nation. Therefore, the movement to unify the country to save it is a collective action of the entire nation and a crystallization of common will. Collective action should be organized, organized to save the country. In order to save the country, we must first consolidate unity in order to develop the entire strength of the entire nation. So to put it bluntly, first, we must consolidate the foundation of unity and improve and promote the spirit of the nation. First, we must seek national sovereignty and seek national rejuvenation. At the same time, although the country is so serious, we must have a unified will and concentrate our strength. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan defeated Russia with the collective action of the entire Yamato nation. During the Sino-Japanese War, China declared war on one hand, and on the other hand, some people advocated protecting the territory and appeasing the people. How can we resist the enemy if we are not unified? With these examples, from now on, we must first seek unity, concentrate our strength, consolidate the foundation of the country, and promote our national strength. This is the only way for us to save the country. I hope that the leaders of the literary and art circles in Shanghai will sincerely establish an organization, generate power from the organization, and work together to save the country. This is my biggest hope. (To be continued)

### The National Match Production and Sales Cooperative Held its Inaugural Ceremony Yesterday Morning

Chairman Liu Hongsheng and Xu Zhiyi Reported, Director Wu Shichang Gave Instructions Emphasizing Three Key Points

The general office and Shanghai branch of the China National Match Production and Sales Cooperative opened simultaneously yesterday. The inaugural ceremony was held at 10:30 AM yesterday morning on the seventh floor of the cooperative's building at 33 Sichuan Road. More than 200 guests from Chinese, Japanese, and American circles attended. Director Wu Dingchang personally attended and gave instructions. Details are recorded below:

Attending Guests

Yesterday's attendees included: Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi (represented by Wu Qiding), Director of the Tax Bureau Wu Qiding, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan (represented by Wu Huanru), Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau Sheng Shengyi, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau Zou Bingwen, and representatives from party, government, and banking circles Du Yuesheng, Xu Xinliu, Bei Songsun, Qin Runqing, Lu Jianquan, Guo Shun, Yu Zuoting, Wang Xingyao, Jin Guoshu, Yang Jiemei, Qian Chengxu, etc.; Secretary Tsune of the Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe's office, Consul Fukui representing Consul General Koiso, Military Attaché Okino representing Naval Attaché Honda, Consul General of Tianjin Horiuchi Ujo, Consul General of Shanghai Fukui Jun, Military Attaché of the Embassy Kita Seiichi, Commercial Attaché Iwai, Chamber of Commerce President Yoshida, Resident Group Leader American, Yu Ling, Bai Lang, Hudeman, and Lin Heng from American Match Company, and news reporters, totaling more than 200 people, making it a grand occasion.

Inaugural Ceremony

The ceremony hall was set up on the seventh floor. The inaugural ceremony began at 10:30 AM. The order of events was: ㊀ All stood at attention; ㊁ Bowed respectfully to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; ㊂ The chairman respectfully read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will; ㊃ Silent mourning; ㊄ Chairman and Director Liu Hongsheng of the cooperative delivered the opening remarks; ㊅ Standing Committee member Xu Zhiyi reported on the preparations; ㊆ Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang delivered instructions; ㊇ Wu Qiding, representing Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, delivered instructions; ㊈ Speeches; ㊉ Chairman delivered a thank-you speech; ㊉㊀ Photograph; ㊉㊁ Refreshments and adjournment.

Chairman's Report

After the ceremony, Chairman and Director Liu Hongsheng delivered the opening remarks, stating: "Today, we are holding the inaugural ceremony of this cooperative. We are honored to have Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Director Wu representing Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, representatives from other party and government organs, and all the distinguished guests present. This cooperative was established to rescue the domestic match industry. All articles of association, plans, and all important measures have been submitted to the government for approval. Recently, the government ordered all factories to join uniformly, deeply understanding that this kind of cooperative method is the only way to save the domestic match industry. However, this matter is still an initiative at present. My colleagues and I may have shortcomings in our considerations. We hope that all sages will not hesitate to give guidance. We earnestly look forward to it. Regarding the past preparations, I now invite Mr. Xu Zhiyi, Executive Director of this cooperative, to report."

Preparations

Executive Director Xu Zhiyi then reported, saying: "The match industry has suffered for a long time and urgently needs a way to save itself. In the past, we considered using methods such as monopoly sales, public sales, or control, but due to various difficulties, none were realized. Therefore, the National Match Industry Association changed its approach and initiated production and sales cooperation. However, in addition to Chinese-owned factories, there are still several Japanese-owned factories in Hebei and Shandong provinces, and two American-owned factories in Jiangsu province. We must properly plan how to get them to join the cooperation in order to achieve the effect of saving the industry. Therefore, the association appointed a committee to negotiate with Japanese and American manufacturers separately. Among them, how to limit the production volume of each factory is the most important. Some advocated using production capacity as the standard, while others advocated using the sales volume of each factory as the standard. Both arguments were not fair. The former only benefited large factories, while the latter only benefited small factories. After several considerations, it was decided to use the production records of the Tax Bureau as the standard. Japanese and American factories were given preferential treatment in terms of volume based on facts, but they were also subject to the regulations of not setting up new factories and limiting production volume. This organization is nominally a cooperative but in reality, it is a control. Because the matter is an initiative and involves international relations, all articles of association, rescue plans, the agreement first signed with Japanese manufacturers, and the supplementary measures to be implemented have been submitted to the government for approval. Since being approved by the government to establish this cooperative in March of last year, the preparation has been complicated and time-consuming. Recently, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry have also stipulated a deadline, ordering the industry to join. This cooperative is scheduled to open its general office and Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai branches simultaneously today. Currently, the factories in each province where branches have been established, a total of seven Japanese factories, have all joined. The two American factories have also reached a cooperation agreement. Among the Chinese factories in the three regions, a total of fifty-six, forty-three have joined the cooperative. Thirteen have not yet joined. Other regions where branches have not been established are also in the process of negotiation. The above-mentioned thirteen factories are all located in Shandong Province, which are the factories that recently opposed this cooperative as reported in the newspapers. Their total production volume accounts for about 8% of the total volume in the three regions, and about 19% of the total volume in the Shandong-Henan region. The publicity texts published by these factories in the newspapers recently mostly misunderstand the articles of association and plans of this cooperative. For example, they pointed out that the capital of this cooperative is 5 million yuan, which must be borne by each factory. It must be known that the articles of association of this cooperative stipulate that the total capital is 5 million yuan, which refers to the highest limit nationwide. However, in order to take into account the burden on each factory, only one-quarter is currently collected, and only one-quarter of that quarter is collected in cash, while the rest can be paid with inventory. Another example is the preferential volume for Japanese factories. The two regions of Shandong, Henan, and North China have a total of more than 100,000 cases. The total annual volume of the three regions is only more than 840,000 cases. The remaining more than 100,000 cases per month will reach more than 120 cases this year. Where will so many cases come from? It is self-evident that they mistakenly used years as months. Another example is that the annual expenditure of the general office is 1 million yuan, etc. At first glance, it seems quite large, but in fact, the total operating expenses of each factory are more than this. Now that all are borne by this cooperative, the above figures are not only not high, but also will be more economical in the future when branches and sub-branches are established throughout the country. As for the Shandong Provincial Government has telegraphed this cooperative to send personnel to negotiate and mediate, as of today, this cooperative has not received any formal notification of this matter. In short, these thirteen factories have not studied the articles of association and plans in detail, resulting in various misunderstandings. It is regrettable. Today, we are only providing an explanation for the most common of these misunderstandings."

Director's Instructions

Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang delivered instructions, saying: "The economic development of various countries has gone through a stage of free competition. However, as a result of free competition, various malpractices inevitably occur. In terms of quantity, supply and demand cannot be balanced; in terms of methods, products are crude and poorly made, and even national taxes are evaded and not put on the right track. In order to promote economic development and prevent malpractices, governments of various countries have wanted to use control methods to correct them. However, using government power to control also has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, prudent economists mostly advocate that each industry should seek self-control under government supervision. Our government is now revising the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, etc., based on this intention. The founding spirit of the National Match Production and Sales Cooperative is in line with the government's policy. Although it was initiated earlier, there were considerable twists and turns in its progress. However, its articles of association, plans, and related contracts have been approved for implementation, which is in line with the government's supervisory intent. I am very happy to attend the opening ceremony. I have three points of view, please pay attention to them: ㊀ The cooperative must consider consumers, and must reduce costs, improve quality, and stabilize prices so that consumers can benefit. ㊁ The cooperative must take the overall interests of the industry as its goal, and not seek private gain for a few or a part of the industry. ㊂ The cooperative must take into account the distribution of supply and demand, especially in areas where transportation is inconvenient and industry has not yet been developed. It must plan comprehensively so that consumers in all regions can obtain the same benefits."

Finance Minister's Instructions

Wu Qiding, representing Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, delivered instructions, saying: "Today is the opening of the National Match Cooperative. I am very honored to be dispatched to attend on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. Regarding the need for cooperative undertakings in this era, and the various policies for conducting cooperation, Minister Wu's instructions are detailed and need no further elaboration. What I cannot help but say is that in the past, the match industry was in a state of extreme depression due to mutual infighting. It had no choice but to seek co-existence through cooperation. Therefore, although cooperative undertakings are new creations, the match manufacturers are all old. I deeply hope that from now on, they will work together with one heart and one mind, seek truth from facts, and jointly reverse the crisis. They must make the old position more consolidated and the new situation develop day by day. From the perspective of the Ministry's management of tax administration, I especially hope that from now on, the match business will be greatly developed, and the match unified tax will improve day by day. This is not only fortunate for the industry, but also a blessing for the country. I am offering a word at the beginning of its establishment to wish it success." Yu Ling, General Manager of American Match Company, also delivered a speech, stating: "In the past, our factory has cooperated with Chinese businesses, and the results have been remarkable. After the success of this cooperation, we will continue to work hard to cooperate to the end to seek the common interests of both parties." Then, the chairman delivered a thank-you speech, stating: "Today, we are very grateful for the guidance of Minister Wu and all of you. We will follow the points you have instructed and work hard to implement them." At around 11:00 AM, the ceremony ended and guests were invited to the fifth floor for refreshments, champagne, and tea. They dispersed happily at noon.

### Private Hospitals are Also Subject to Income Tax

Belonging to Profit-Making Enterprises; According to Category A of the First Class

Accountant Shen Liren of the Chinese Accountant Firm in this city was previously commissioned by several private hospitals as a consultant for accounting system design and income tax. Later, because the accounting subjects of profit-making income and freelance professions were different, he specifically inquired about the Income Tax Shanghai Office. Yesterday, he received a reply stating that after investigation, the hospitals belong to profit-making enterprises and should be handled in accordance with Article 1, Category A of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. It is heard that Accountant Shen has begun to prepare profit and loss statements for the hospitals.

### The Public Prosecutor's Office Filed a Public Prosecution for the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory Robbery Case

The Robbers Hid in the Furnace Room Before the Robbery; The Robbers Also Robbed Wang Jianzhen's Home Once

On the afternoon of December 4th of last year, at 9:00 PM, when the Shin Hsin No. 9 Cotton Mill at 140 Macau Road was preparing to distribute wages to workers, three robbers suddenly broke in and robbed 1,800 yuan of wages and attempted to escape. At that time, the factory's hired guard happened to be nearby and shot at a robber armed with a pistol, Huang Shaohua from Jiangbei. Huang also fired back, but the bullet jammed and could not be fired. Huang was shot and injured, and was arrested. The other robbers fled to the back door. Later, the police station ordered detectives to come and detain Huang. They found all the stolen goods and a pistol on Huang. They also found a pistol at the back door of the factory. Detective Chief Zhu Hanbo and Detective Tao Afu of the Gordon Road Police Station arrested the criminals Ma Da, Gu Naifu, Ji Zhenhua, Chen Huisheng, and a woman surnamed Meng. They also found two pistols and eleven bullets, and 70 yuan in legal tender on Wang Mengshi. According to Ma Da's confession, he also went to the Shin Hsin robbery. He also said that Li Yunzhang, one of the Shin Hsin guards, and Yang Yaozhong and Zhang Ronghua, workers in the furnace room, were all involved. Li Yunzhang helped Ma and others to destroy the lock on the back door and allowed Ma and others to enter the factory. However, it was too early, so they hid in the furnace room managed by Yang and Li. Then, they carried out the robbery. The detectives then arrested Li, Yang, and Zhang and sent them to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in the eighth criminal court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Prosecutor's Office, explained the previous situation and filed a lawsuit against Ma Da, Li Yunzhang, Yang Yaozhong, Zhang Ronghua, and Huang Shaohua for robbery. He also said that Ma Da, Chen Huisheng, Gu Naifu, Ji Zhenhua, and Wang Mengshi robbed Wang Jianzhen of 4,368 yuan in legal tender on Dong Hanbi Li Road, Wuzhou Road, at 10:40 AM on December 21st of last year. Wang Jianzhen was a staff member of Kailuan Coal Mine Company. He carried the above amount of money from the head office at 33 Sichuan Road to the branch company on Wuzhou Road to distribute wages to workers on that day. They were robbed by Ma and others on Dong Hanbi Li Road. The defendants Ma Da and Chen Huisheng were the ones who carried out the robbery. Gu Naifu provided the pistols. Ji Zhenhua was the one who stored the guns. Wang Mengshi received the stolen goods. The legal tender found on her when she was arrested was part of the original stolen goods. He requested that they be punished according to the law. Then, the court interrogated Ma Da and others about the facts of the case and then ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### The Trial of the Case of Inducing a Dance Girl to Have Sex is Concluded

Verdict Scheduled for the 6th

Zou Cuifei, a dance girl at the Shunfeng Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road, is 28 years old and has a beautiful appearance. Her mother, Zou Loushi, as her legal representative, hired a lawyer to criminally accuse Huang Qiluan, a student at Yuqing Middle School in Jiangwan, of designing to intoxicate Zou Cuifei with alcohol and inducing her to go to the Hongkou Grand Hotel to commit rape. She also filed a lawsuit against Huang's friend Lu Bin and Yu Ying, a dance girl at Shunfeng, for helping with the rape. The trial has concluded. Because Huang Qiluan's address is unknown, the court ordered a suspension of the trial. Lu and Yu were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment, suspended for two years, for assisting in the rape of a girl over 14 and under 16 years old. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for trial. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Xu Fuji presided over the trial in the 12th Civil Court. In the civil part of the case, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, Zou Cuifei, stated that Zou Cuifei was a dance girl at the Shunfeng Dance Hall. Before this case occurred, Zou Cuifei could earn an average of more than 120 yuan in dance fees per month. After being induced to have sex by Huang Qiluan and others, her business plummeted, and she could earn at most more than 50 yuan in dance fees per month. According to this ratio, the loss per month is more than 70 yuan, which should be more than 8,720 yuan calculated over ten years. Also, Zou Cuifei attempted suicide after this case occurred, and her spirit and reputation were greatly damaged. Therefore, she also claimed 1,200 yuan in incidental damages, totaling 9,922 yuan. She requested that the three defendants be ordered to jointly and severally compensate. Only Lu Bin, one of the defendants, appeared in court and stated that this was a matter between Zou and Huang Qiluan and had nothing to do with him. Moreover, he used to work at Rihe Yangxing, but is now unemployed and has no money to compensate. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that Huang Qiluan and Yu Ying did not appear in court today and should be allowed to argue ex parte. Judge Xu ordered the debate in this case to be concluded and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 6th of this month.

### Egyptian Prophet Predicts World Political Situation

World War Will Break Out in 1938; Whether Accurate Remains to be Proven by Facts

Mr. Mamun P., an Egyptian spiritualist, has traveled around the world and recently arrived in Shanghai from India, residing at Room 903 of the International Hotel. He recently released his predictions as follows: The Second World War will begin between the summer and autumn of 1938. The reason for its outbreak is the conflict of power between Italy and Germany in Spain. France will protest this power and demand that the two countries withdraw their troops from the Spanish border. This protest will be rejected by the two countries, and the European war will officially begin. The Soviet Union will ally with France in the first month of the war and join the war. Japan will unite with Germany within three months and deploy heavy troops on the eastern border of the Soviet Union. However, due to the harsh environment, it may not join suddenly. If Japan joins the war, the United States will also be involved to resist Japan's advantage in the Pacific. However, fearing conflict with the United States and the deepening of its antipathy towards China, it will be extremely difficult for Japan to decide whether to participate in the war. The United Kingdom and the United States will temporarily act as observers and mediators to avoid the expansion of the war. However, the result will be ineffective because Japan will eventually unite with Germany. The United States will officially join the war within six months after the war begins. The United Kingdom will join one year after the war begins. He does not want to disclose which side it will ally with. In the end, the war will take two years to stop. The relationship between China and Japan will not involve war in 1937. Japan will gain no benefit from war with China. However, the land of Manchuria will sooner or later be recovered by China.

### A Young Girl, Yu Xiuyue, was Abducted to Hankou

How Can One Girl Be Matched to Two Men? Shui Miaogen has been Detained

Yu Xin, a woman from Ningbo, lives at 103 Fuqing Lane, East Broadway Road. Her daughter, Xiuyue, 16 years old, suddenly disappeared at around 2:00 PM on November 30th of last year. Yu searched everywhere, but there was no news. Until the day before yesterday, Zhang Guocai came to her house and said that her daughter, Xiuyue, had been taken to Hankou by her friend Shui Miaogen (21 years old) to temporarily live at her sister Yu Genmei's place. She was willing to follow him and be his wife. He was now informing her and acting as a matchmaker. The betrothal gift could be 200 yuan, seeking Yu's consent. Yu then learned that her daughter had been abducted by Shui Miaogen. Yu used to live at 88 Yuqing Lane, East Xiuhua Road. Shui lived nearby at 66, so they knew each other. Because Yu told Shui that Xiuyue had been betrothed to someone else, and one girl could not be matched to two men, and hated Shui's unruly behavior, she refused him angrily. Zhang Guocai had to take the opportunity to escape. At 7:00 PM that afternoon, Yu Xin happened to pass near Broadway Road on Dengtuo Road and met Shui. She twisted him and handed him over to the Chinese patrol at the 901st station and brought him to the Huishan Police Station for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the Public Works Department explained the case and said that the girl Xiuyue was still at her sister Yu Genmei's place at 24 Xiaodong Street Alley in the Chinese Concession of Hankou. The defendant already has a wife in his hometown. Now, he is filing a public prosecution for obstructing marriage and requesting a postponement. Then, according to Yu Xin's testimony of the events, when questioned, the defendant confessed that he had been intimate with the girl for about three months. He met Xiuyue on Huafeng Road that day. She voluntarily followed him to the Gonghexiang Wharf and took a ship to live temporarily with her sister in Hankou. They did not sleep in the same bed. She claimed that she had not been matched to anyone else. He stammered and begged for forgiveness. Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to be returned to custody and changed the date for another hearing.

### Supplementing and Correcting Points in the Draft of Collection Guidelines

Continued letter from Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, et al. to the Income Tax Affairs Office (Continued)

B. Regarding the draft of collection guidelines for Category Two income from salaries and remuneration, the points that are considered to require supplementation and modification: ⑴ Clause 1 of the draft stipulates the scope of public officials, and Clause 2 stipulates that laborers and workers of public agencies are non-public officials. However, whether soldiers, policemen, etc., should be treated as public officials, or regarded as laborers and workers and not as public officials, seems unclear and should be clearly stipulated. ⑵ Clause 4 of the draft states, "Expenses disbursed to public officials for official business are not within the scope of salaries and remuneration." The so-called disbursed expenses should naturally be limited to those that are actually reported and reimbursed. If they are not actually reported and reimbursed but only a whole number is disbursed, they should be included in the salary and taxed together. Please provide a clear provision on this point. ⑶ Clause 1 of Article 16 of the Implementing Regulations places retirement pensions, old-age pensions, etc., in the category of salaries. However, in actual circumstances, these types of retirement pensions and old-age pensions often include a portion of salaries that have already been subject to income tax (for example, an agency employing staff deducts a portion from the staff's salary each month, and the agency supplements a portion, combining them into a sum that is accumulated for a certain period, and paid in a lump sum when the staff retires or reaches old age). In that case, the retirement pensions and old-age pensions mentioned in the Implementing Regulations that should be taxed should be clearly explained in the collection guidelines as the untaxed portion, to avoid double taxation. Furthermore, a portion of these types of retirement pensions and old-age pensions is actually interest on stored salaries. This portion of interest should be taxed according to Category Three income, and should not be taxed as Category Two income for the entire amount. All of these issues are not addressed in the Implementing Regulations and should be supplemented in the collection guidelines. ⑷ Clause 4 of Article 17 of the Implementing Regulations stipulates that self-employed professionals and others engaged in various occupations can deduct expenses from their income in advance, for "other directly necessary expenses for business." Article 9 of this draft then defines these directly necessary expenses into the following four clauses: (1) Repair costs for business equipment, (2) Advertising costs, (3) Public association membership fees, (4) Stationery, postage, and other miscellaneous expenses. The listed expenses are practically too sparse. Referring to the expenses that the United Kingdom and the United States allow for self-employed professionals and others engaged in various occupations, and the loss categories listed in the draft accounting regulations for accounting firms set by the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants, it is proposed to supplement "directly necessary expenses" as follows: 1. Public association membership fees and necessary expenses for attending meetings; 2. Meal expenses for business employees (limited to those provided in the workplace); 3. Public levies; 4. Necessary entertainment expenses for business; 5. Sub-commission public fees; 6. Bad debt losses for advances paid for clients; 7. Depreciation of business equipment. ㊄ Should the accounting system of business places adopt the accrual basis or the cash basis? Or can either of the two systems be chosen and adopted? There are no regulations in the collection guidelines. If the "accrual basis" and "cash basis" can be arbitrarily chosen and changed at will, then taxpayers can find ways to evade taxes. Therefore, there should be clear restrictions. However, examining the accounting system of self-employed professionals in the United Kingdom, the cash basis is uniformly adopted, and their income is the surplus on their "Statement of Receipts and Disbursements" rather than the surplus on their "Profit and Loss Account." It seems that a clause should also be added to the collection guidelines in our country to stipulate the accounting system to be used by offices, in order to ensure uniformity and prevent tax evasion. ㊅ Clause 2 of Article 13 of the draft stipulates, "If salary is replaced by borrowing, tax should be paid on the actual amount borrowed in each month." The so-called "borrowing" should consider its legal effect. If it is indeed borrowing in nature and there is a possibility of repayment in the future, income tax should not be withheld in advance. If it is indeed an advance payment of salary and there is no possibility of deduction in the future, it can be handled according to the example of discounting salary. The provisions of this clause seem redundant on the one hand, and do not recognize the fact that there is indeed borrowing on the other hand, so it can be deleted. ㊆ The last item of Article 16 of the draft states, "If the monthly salary increases or decreases during the year, it should be calculated according to the above-mentioned method when paying supplementary tax." This is because the regulations stipulate that for Category Two income, the tax rate is determined according to the monthly average amount, so it is very reasonable to recalculate the monthly average income and pay supplementary tax at the end of the year when receiving bonuses, dividends, etc. However, from the opposite perspective, salary reduction also often occurs. The guidelines only have provisions for supplementary tax, but no provisions for tax refunds, which seems careless. For example, Mr. A originally received a monthly salary of 600 yuan from January, and 23 yuan and 6 jiao were deducted each month. He has paid a total of 141 yuan and 6 jiao in tax within six months. However, from July, his monthly salary was reduced to 300 yuan until the end of December, and 5 yuan and 6 jiao should be deducted each month, totaling 33 yuan and 6 jiao in six months. The total tax deducted in both items is 175 yuan and 2 jiao. However, his monthly average salary for the year is 450 yuan, and he should pay 12 yuan and 6 jiao per month. For twelve months, he only needs to pay 151 yuan and 2 jiao. However, he has been deducted 175 yuan and 2 jiao, so he should apply for a tax refund of 24 yuan to be reasonable. This provision must be supplemented. ㊇ Furthermore, the regulations only stipulate that Category Two income should be calculated and taxed based on the monthly average amount, but for salaries and remuneration calculated by month, it does not specify which month or months the average amount is for. Then, should taxpayers receiving monthly salaries in Category Two also apply the calendar year system to average their income? Or can they average their income according to the customary year, according to the settlement method for Category One income? Or can they only average the months in which they actually had income, and months without income cannot be included in the average? These issues are extremely important. After examining the regulations and implementing regulations, there are no clear provisions, so they should be supplemented in the collection guidelines. For example, whether the above-mentioned example should be allowed a tax refund, and how to average their income, are extremely relevant. If the six months of the original salary is taken as an average period, then there is no need for a tax refund. If a year of twelve months is taken as an average period, then a tax refund must be given. Also, if Mr. A received a monthly salary of 600 yuan from February to June, took sick leave from July to August and stopped receiving salary, and reduced his salary to 400 yuan per month from September to December, then is Mr. A's monthly average income the average amount of the ten months of receiving salary, totaling 520 yuan? Or is it the average amount of the entire twelve months, totaling 433 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen? This is also an extremely important matter that must be clearly stipulated. ㊈ Article 19 of the draft states, "For income of self-employed professionals and others engaged in various occupations, if there is no fixed paying agency or employer, income should be settled every six months, and income tax should be declared and paid." It seems that the phrase "if there is no fixed paying agency or employer" should be changed to "if they have their own business place or no employer." This is because the income of self-employed professionals, etc., that is of a perennial nature often has a fixed paying agency, but because the expenses of their business place must be deducted from their income, income tax cannot be withheld and paid by the paying agency. The collection guidelines allow them to settle once every six months because their business place has expenses and their monthly income is uneven, not because of whether they have a fixed paying agency. ㊉ Government agencies provide public officials, and business agencies and professional offices provide employees with meal and accommodation allowances and travel expenses. The nominal amount of their salaries increases these allowances without restriction. According to US precedents, if the employer provides meals, accommodation, and travel expenses for the convenience of the employee's service, then the allowance or its value is not treated as the employee's salary. If it is not for the convenience of the employer's business but for the employee's own living expenses, it should be included in their salary and calculated as income. This principle is very reasonable and should be supplemented in this draft. (To be continued)

### Municipal Health Bureau Exempts Verification of Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioner Licenses

The Municipal Health Bureau originally stipulated that registered Chinese medicine practitioners should submit their registered licenses for verification once every year from February 1st to the end of March. Because the Bureau's review and certification of Chinese medicine practitioners will be held soon, the previous section on verifying registered Chinese medicine practitioner licenses will be exempted.

### The Shanghai Municipal Police (S.M.P.) Continues to Capture Multiple Notorious Robbers

All are related to robbery cases on Haining Road and Pingliang Road. Two robbers each wore diamond rings, and firearms were also seized.

Chinese Detective Shang Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Police (S.M.P.) arrested two bandits from Pudong, Zhu Abei and Pan Ruilou, at Room 30 of the Fair Hotel on Edward Road at 5:30 PM on January 29th of this year. They were found to be related to the robbery case at the residence of No. 47, Lane 253, Park Road on January 21st of this year and were escorted to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Detective Shang, together with Chinese Detectives Wang Youshan, Li Wenbin, and Gao Yuting, continued to capture one accomplice, Shi Zhiliang, a local, in front of the Pinfang Teahouse on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession. After being taken to the police station and questioned, Shi admitted to leading a group to rob the property of the resident of No. 75, Lane 590, Haining Road on January 7th of this year, using weapons. The coat he was wearing was also stolen property. He also confessed to having three pistols hidden at Yin Xiaodi's apartment at No. 45, No. 19 Zilaihuo Street. After verifying the confession, the detectives, together with French police detectives, went to

Zilaihuo Street to arrest Yin Xiaodi but could not find him. They only seized a suitcase in the room, containing a Mauser pistol engraved with the words "Hu Wei" (i.e., Shanghai Garrison), eight bullets, two Youning brand and Dimeng brand pistols, and sixteen bullets. They then learned that his accomplices were hiding in Room 509 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road. The detectives went to the Great Shanghai and arrested two bandits, Li A'gen, a local, and Shen Zhangshi, a 19-year-old

Ningbo woman (i.e., Zhang Xiaomao, formerly working as a hostess No. 1 at the Tianyunlou in the Wing On Company). At that time, Li immediately tried to discard a diamond ring he was wearing on his finger but was discovered by the detectives. They then continued to arrest five accomplices at Room 556 of the Dajiangnan Hotel on Fujian Road: Yin Xiaodi (i.e., the person who hid the guns), Zhang Linfu, Zhang Linsheng, Lu Xiaobao, and Sheng Huashi, a woman from Tongzhou. They were all taken to the police station. Later, they arrested Liu Fu, a Shanghainese, in Room 504 of the Great Shanghai Hotel and also seized

a diamond ring, and they were detained.

Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station stated the circumstances of the case, saying that it was found that the defendants Li A'gen and Zhang Linfu were related to the two robbery cases on Pingliang Road and Tangshan Road, Zhang Linsheng was only involved in the Pingliang Road case, and Lu Xiaobao was suspected of being involved in the Tangshan Road case. According to the defendant Liu Fu's confession at the police station, he

found a pistol and a Mauser pistol in Zhabei during the Shanghai war, but he firmly denied the robbery case, but in the Tangshan Road case, he received 75 yuan. Because the seized firearms have not yet been sent to the Ordinance Office for inspection, he requested that the defendants be detained and combined with the Zhu Abei case for interrogation at a later date. Shi Zhiliang confessed to robbing the Haining Road and Pingliang Road cases with Yin Xiaodi, Zhu Abei, Zhang Linfu, Liu Fu, and those who are on the run. Yin Xiaodi and Zhang Linfu

confessed to robbing the Haining Road case. Afterwards, Yin received 15 yuan and Zhang received over 100 yuan. Liu Fu confessed to having two pistols. In the Tangshan Road robbery case, Zhang Linfu gave him 50 yuan in legal tender and a diamond ring. The other defendants all gave vague confessions. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confessions and ordered that the defendants be detained until the 6th of this month to be interrogated with Zhu Abei.

### Autopsy of Foreign Elderly Doctor who Committed Suicide

Death by Morphine Injection

Lai Shi Laige Aidao'erfu (transliteration), a national of a European country "Youge Sikelaijifu," aged 73, practiced medicine and set up a clinic on the fifth floor of the Hardoon Building on Nanjing Road. Last year, Lai suddenly suffered from severe lung disease. Although he was treated, it did not work, which made him very angry. On the 30th of last month, he suddenly had the idea of ending his life. He secretly injected himself with morphine three times in his clinic and fell to the ground from the poison. His son Laisilaige found him and immediately called for a doctor to treat him, and then sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died shortly after, and the hospital reported to the General Patrol Room, which ordered detectives to investigate. The injection equipment and a suicide note were found. The body was taken to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, together with Wei and Zhang, two forensic doctors, and clerk Wang Zuyi, visited the room to examine the body. According to the report submitted by the son, Zhang Jun concluded that the deceased, Western doctor Lai Shi Laige Aidao'erfu, male, committed suicide by injecting himself with morphine during his lifetime, and the body was handed over to his son Laisilaige to sign for collection.

### Robbery Motivated by Resentment from Unsuccessful Loan

Pudong Xinmalu robbery case solved

The home of Zhu Shunli, a local boatman, at No. 1, Zhu Jiazhai near Pudong Xinmalu, was suddenly visited by six or seven robbers at 7 pm on the 26th of last month. They spoke in local and Jiangbei accents, and held two pistols. They crossed the branches and entered by breaking the door. Under the pretense of searching for opium, they drove the whole family into a corner and began to loot. After about an hour, they were robbed of 200 yuan in legal tender, several dozen yuan in auxiliary coins, and Western-style overcoats, woolen robes, woolen hats, leather shoes, etc. They took the stolen goods and fled in droves. While the police were strictly pursuing them, the Changzhan Yangjing District Security Group's Third Team Headquarters received a secret report from an informant on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and arrested two robbers, Wu Jingen, from No. 14, Zhu Jiazhai, and Zhang Quanfu, from No. 4, Zhang Jiazhai, Changzhan. After interrogation, it was learned that Wu was related to the victim as a relative. Wu had repeatedly failed to borrow money from Zhu, so he colluded with his accomplices Zhang Quanfu, Zhang Zhifu, Xu Xiao, Ha Laosi, and others, and went to the Sihua Hotel in Hongkou to discuss the plan. Then they came to Pudong to commit the robbery. Wu hid in advance to prevent detection. Several pawn tickets were found on Wu, and 50 yuan in legal tender was found on Zhang. That night, they were all escorted to the group headquarters and transferred to the Pudong Branch Bureau for strict interrogation by the Detective Squad. According to Wu's confession, he was 21 years old, a native of Pudong, and called the victim "grandfather." He directly admitted that he was resentful for not being able to borrow money and intended to commit the robbery. According to Zhang's confession, he was 19 years old, a local, and lost money gambling with Wu, so he called me and my brother Zhang Zhifu to go rob and divide the spoils for spending. After verifying the confession, the captain immediately sent detectives Jiang Binru and others to the Quancheng Pawnshop on Dong Hanbili Road, Hongkou, and recovered the original stolen goods: a woolen camel hair robe, pawned for four yuan, and to the Xinshun Pawnshop on Yuanchang Road, and recovered a Western-style woolen coat, pawned for eight yuan. After Director Zhang investigated the case, he ordered them to be detained and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation, and ordered the strict arrest of the other robbers who were on the run and bring them to justice.

### Five Broker Associations Jointly Submit a Document to the Yuan and Ministry

Regarding Temporary Business Profit, Opinions on Income Tax Contribution

The joint association of brokerage firms from five exchanges in this city, concerning the income from temporary business operations, specifically requests the Ministry of Finance to change the calculation method to an annual basis and pay taxes based on net profit. It has also submitted documents to various Yuan and Ministries, requesting that the tax rate for Item C of the First Category of income be changed to be the same as that of Item A, to ensure fairness. The two submitted documents are recorded below:

Net Profit Tax Payment

The joint association previously submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Submitting this document to implement income tax, considering the actual situation, and respectfully presenting our humble opinions, hoping for your review and approval. We believe that income tax is levied based on the people's ability to pay taxes. Only those with income have the obligation to pay taxes. We have repeatedly received announcements from your ministry, both domestically and internationally, that all those who are capable should comply. Brokerage firms are willing to take the lead in complying with Item A of the First Category. The income of customers should also comply with the provisions of Item C and be earnestly implemented. However, there are some obstacles in the procedures. Regarding the provision in Article 19 of the implementation rules that the amount of income should be calculated at the end of each transaction, after detailed research, we all believe that it is extremely rare for exchange customers to only make one entry and exit transaction. Usually, customers regard this as a business, and there are often multiple purchases and sales, gains and losses, intertwined, forming a whole that cannot be divided. This is quite similar to the transactions of factories and businesses. The core of the exchange now also relies on the transactions of these customers. If we insist on calculating each transaction, it will be difficult. This is the first obstacle. Secondly, the forms issued by the Shanghai Office for each exchange require that profitable transactions be recorded one by one, while losses are ignored. However, the regulations already recognize temporary profits as a business, so there cannot be only profits and no losses. Article 7 of the regulations clearly stipulates that the income of the First Category is calculated and taxed based on the net profit amount. Item C is not excluded. If we now tax the profits without counting the losses, customers will inevitably raise disputes regarding the amount of withholding, leading to numerous entanglements. This is the second obstacle. Furthermore, brokers have a more intimate understanding of their customers. Based on our projections, we believe that they will not be able to bear the burden and may eventually become hesitant to move forward. This will directly affect the exchange's operations. However, in terms of tax revenue, gaining here and losing there may not be the best solution. Taxing profits while ignoring losses seems to contradict your ministry's intention to levy taxes based on actual income. In order to ensure smooth implementation, we must consider both aspects. Therefore, we are submitting this document detailing the actual situation for your review and approval. We humbly request that you consider the situation and allow the income of Item C of the First Category, within the scope of transactions made by the same customer on the same exchange, to be settled annually based on their net profit amount, in accordance with commercial practice. This will benefit both tax revenue and business operations, and it will be fair to everyone. Furthermore, regarding the tax rate for Item C of the First Category of income, we request that it be changed to be the same as that of Item A. We are submitting another document separately, combining and clarifying our requests. Submitted to the Ministry of Finance by representatives of the Shanghai Gold Exchange Brokers Association, Zhan Liansheng; the Shanghai Chinese Cloth Exchange Brokers Association, Wu Xunqing; the Chinese Securities Exchange Brokers Association, Zhu Anfu; the Shanghai Flour Exchange Brokers Association, Wei Yun; and the Shanghai Grain Exchange Brokers Association, Xue Chengzhang."

Change to Flat Tax Rate

The joint association yesterday separately submitted documents to the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Submitting this document, as per the order of the Ministry of Finance (your ministry), all types of income tax will be levied starting from January 1, 1937. We also received a notice from the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Office, attaching forms and ordering us to comply and pay in installments. We have found that the items related to our brokerage firms in the Provisional Income Tax Regulations are the annual profit income of Item A of the First Category and the temporary business profit income of Item C. The former is the taxation of our brokerage firms' own profit income, which should be complied with in the same way as other profit-making businesses. The latter, according to the implementation rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, is the taxation of customers, and our brokerage firms are only responsible for withholding. However, the advisors believe that the tax rate is not fair and have requested us to forward the reasons for the amendment. We are hereby presenting it to your Yuan (Ministry). The tax rate for temporary business profit income, according to Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations, is 30 per mille as the starting point and up to 200 per mille if it cannot be calculated based on the capital amount. However, although the capital amount of temporary business operations may not be fixed, it is definitely not possible to operate without any capital. Moreover, according to the Civil Code, this type of business is subject to unlimited liability, so the responsibility of the business entity cannot be reduced due to the lack of fixed capital. This is very clear. According to Article 4, those that can be calculated based on the capital amount shall be handled in accordance with Article 3. Article 3 calculates the income together with the capital amount. Although the two methods are different, let us assume a standard for comparison. For Item A, assume that a business is established with a capital of 10,000 yuan, and the annual profit is 999.99 yuan. The tax should be paid at 30 per mille, which is 30 yuan. This is the starting point of Item A tax. Also, assume that a capital of 10,000 yuan is invested, and the annual profit is 2,500 yuan. The tax should be paid at 100 per mille, which is 250 yuan. On average, 100 yuan should be paid for every 1,000 yuan of income. This is the highest point of Item A tax. For Item C, assume that the profit is 999.99 yuan. The tax should be paid at 30 per mille, which is 30 yuan. This is the starting point of Item C tax, which is the same as the amount paid for Item A. Also, assume that the profit is 18,000 yuan. The tax should be paid at 200 per mille, which is 3,600 yuan. On average, 200 yuan must be paid for every 1,000 yuan. This is the highest point of Item C tax, which is twice as high as the highest point of Item A tax. As stated above, the business with the same responsibility has a huge disparity in the tax rate, which does not seem fair. When drafting the legislation, it may have been thought that businesses that cannot be calculated based on capital should be heavily taxed, but it seems that the responsibility of the operator has not been considered, even though the capital amount is not fixed, and it cannot be reduced in law. We propose that your Yuan (Ministry) consider this and grant the request to change the tax rate for Item C of the First Category in the regulations to be the same as that of Item A, in order to ensure fairness. We also request your approval and are extremely grateful. In addition, the transactions of the Securities Exchange, in addition to the request for securities to be the same as other exchanges, have other submissions regarding the bond portion, which are combined and clarified. Submitted."

### Various Organizations Announce Water Fee Delay

Temporarily Deposit in Bank

The joint conference of various organizations in this city yesterday announced to all tap water users in the Public Concession: "Regarding the matter of the British Shanghai Water Company in the Public Concession increasing the tap water fee from 75% to 80% starting from February 1 of this year, after discussion by the joint conference of various organizations, we all believe that it is difficult to increase the burden during this difficult market situation. In addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Government and sending letters to relevant agencies and organizations to negotiate and strive for cancellation, before this case is resolved, all water fees will be deposited in the bank at the original price. The resolution has been passed. We hereby announce to your esteemed users that the water fee starting from February should be temporarily deposited in the bank at the original price, pending resolution. We hereby announce."

### County Land Administration Bureau Corrects Land Price Tax

Deadline for Property Owners to Report Within Ten Days

The Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau, due to its eagerness to launch the first phase of land price tax, proceeded with the collection before the procedures were clear, resulting in many errors. Now, Xing Zhigang, the head of the Fifth District of Shanghai County, has sent a letter to the Bureau requesting that staff be sent to the district with maps and registers to re-verify and correct the errors. The Land Administration Bureau has now replied, stating that it has dispatched registration officer Huang Kejing, clerk Liu Shulian, and Shen Changlu, along with maps and registers, to the district office to handle the verification of land area, tax amount, and registration matters. We hope that each property owner will be informed that if the land price tax notice contains discrepancies in the land area or tax amount, they should immediately investigate the address of the Baojia and bring the registration documents to request verification and correction. If there are any unregistered or transferred properties, they can also take this opportunity to apply for registration. A corresponding letter is hereby replied to for your information. It has been found that there are many property owners in the district who are traveling abroad, and a notice has been published in the newspaper, setting a deadline of ten days for them to return home to handle the matters, in order to emphasize property rights.

### Guangdong Banking Industry and 26 Other Groups Telegraph the National Government to Crack Down on Smuggling

Set Aside Military Issues and Focus on Smuggling Negotiations, Thoroughly Eradicating it Will Benefit the Nation and the People

Shenshi News Agency reports that the Shanghai Guangdong Banking Industry Association, due to the rampant smuggling in various places which has greatly affected commerce, yesterday convened a joint meeting of various industry associations, with representatives from 26 industries such as silk, sugar, and department stores attending. It was decided to telegraph the government to thoroughly curb smuggling and protect financial resources. The secretary, Xiao Zhenkai, drafted the telegram, which was unanimously approved. The telegram reads: "To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since the smuggling by Japanese ronin in North China, more than half a year has passed. In this half year, the customs duties lost have been no less than 400 million yuan, and the number of shops destroyed and closed has been no less than 2,000. The customs of Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Jiaozhou have also been unable to perform their duties due to the trampling of sovereignty. Now, warnings of rampant smuggling in various places are constantly being spread. If the national tax revenue continues to be reduced and commerce continues to be destroyed, if no measures are taken to curb it quickly, we fear that the country will have no available finances in five years, and merchants will have no business to operate. Thinking of the future, it is chilling. Although our government has long established anti-smuggling investigation offices in important ports and passes in various cities for anti-smuggling matters, and has successively promulgated laws and regulations such as preventing smuggling on transportation routes and punishing tax evasion, smugglers are made aware of the warnings and slightly restrained, but such effectiveness can only crack down on our country's treacherous merchants. As for their chief culprits and great villains, the Japanese ronin of a certain country who use force as cover, they are ultimately beyond our reach and cannot be given profound sanctions. For this reason, Han-Korean smugglers also rely on the protection of the Japanese ronin of a certain country, behaving wildly and recklessly. This is why our country's political power cannot thoroughly curb the rampant smuggling. We believe that the smuggling incident of the Japanese ronin this time is an aggressive policy with the same effect as their military actions. Therefore, if our country wants to find a way to rectify the root cause of the smuggling incident, it is difficult to expect to cut the roots and eliminate the pests quickly and effectively unless diplomatic strategies are adopted to undermine their conspiracy. Article 18 of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce stipulates that "all ports of China originally open to trade may adopt measures to prevent tax evasion as they see fit," and customs revenue is also used to offset reparations to various countries. Therefore, if this case can use diplomatic strategies and negotiation, it is not only based on the treaty but also can win the support of international public opinion. Its future still has hope for new development. Looking at the current stalemate, due to the restraint of military affairs, the progress of diplomacy has been delayed, and there is even a trend to wait for a military solution to the same problem. This would fall into the enemy's dual conspiracy of military and economic aggression. How dangerous is that! Our association is deeply saddened by the national crisis and fears the disaster of destruction. We propose that the government set aside military issues and focus on the smuggling incident, and seriously negotiate a date to achieve the goal of thoroughly eradicating smuggling. The lifeline of the nation and the lives of the people are truly dependent on it. We respectfully submit this telegram and beg your consideration. Shanghai Guangdong Banking Industry and 26 other groups kowtow."

Yesterday, the bond market of the Chinese Securities Exchange gradually showed a circling trend. As the Spring Festival holiday is approaching, people's hearts are shifting from stability to dispersion. Both the entry and exit of rights and the rollover transactions of long and short positions have been concluded. The market price initially appeared dim due to the renewed bleakness of the situation.

### Cotton Yarn

Widespread Rumors of a Price Drop in Native Yarn, Marked Yarn Sees Even Sharper Decline

Selling Prices Ease, Ample Inventory, Prices for All Months Drop by More Than Three Yuan

The yarn market is trending weak, with a sharp decline in prices. This is likely due to the approaching end of the year, a customary period for settling accounts, and a market closure of over ten days. Most small investors are squaring their positions, and large investors are reducing their holdings. With inventory easing, the downward trend is particularly severe. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the price of yarn in Hankou had fallen sharply, leading to a surge in selling pressure and a slight drop in market prices.

Geng Feng Buys in the Morning, Sells in the Afternoon

At the opening of the market for marked yarn in the morning, prices for all months showed a slight downward trend, but the momentum remained relatively calm. This was because the large Indian merchant groups were still not easing their holdings. However, due to the approaching settlement date for spot yarn transactions, all parties needed to settle their accounts, resulting in quiet trading. The market remained in a state of fluctuation. The results of the marked yarn showed declines of five to nine jiao (cents) to one yuan compared to the previous day's closing prices. In the afternoon, the market situation changed abruptly, with rumors circulating of a sharp drop in yarn prices in Hankou, with some saying that the yarn was being shipped to Shanghai to settle marked yarn contracts. This led to a sudden surge in selling pressure and a fall in market prices. At the same time, yarn sales were sluggish, and the market sentiment became even more depressed. As a result, prices for all months fell sharply by two jiao two fen (cents) to two jiao eight fen (cents) compared to the morning's closing prices. Geng Feng bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. Sales included 2,050 bales from Jifeng, 2,050 bales from Meiji, 2,700 bales from Hexing, 800 bales from Changyu, 1,200 bales from Fengtai, 1,100 bales from Yuan Yi, 1,050 bales from Tongji, 3,100 bales from Jinchang, 790 bales from Hengde, and 700 bales from Yongda. Purchases included 1,250 bales from Hengyi, 1,000 bales from Yuda, 800 bales from Mingde, 1,300 bales from Dianji, 3,950 bales from Dachangcheng, 3,500 bales from Dachang, 1,400 bales from Changji, 1,700 bales from Runkang, and 2,550 bales from Fukang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.

Spot Yarn Prices Also Fall

Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that various trading houses purchased a total of 761 bales throughout the day, with selling prices falling by 1.2 to 2 yuan. The purchase volume of each trading house is listed below.

Special Certificates to Be Collected This Month

For new cotton yarn and cotton futures contracts for the February term of this year traded at the Standard Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange from February 1st onwards, a special margin of eight yuan in cash will be collected per bale of cotton yarn and three yuan in cash per dan (unit of weight) of cotton. Both cash and credit accounts will be accepted from one party.

Yarn Market Weak, Cotton Market Even More Unsupported

——News of Floods in the U.S. Cotton Belt Eases——

The cotton market is trending weak due to the easing of flood conditions in the U.S. cotton belt, with no major danger to the cotton fields at present. This has further dampened sentiment in the local market. Coupled with the weakness in the yarn market, and the increasing inventory of cotton in Shanghai, demand from factories is sluggish.

Marked Cotton Futures Re-enter the Three Yuan Range

At the opening of the market for marked cotton futures in the morning, prices for all months declined uniformly, and the market situation was unusually weak. This was because the flood in the U.S. cotton belt did not appear to have damaged the cotton fields. Market prices turned downward, and Indian cotton was also normal. With crowded sources of supply and increasing inventories, market sentiment became even more depressed. As a result, prices for all months fell by one jiao (cent) to two jiao five fen (cents) compared to the previous day's closing prices. At the opening of the market in the afternoon, the market situation was very weak. There was news of a decline in U.S. cotton prices, and the yarn market also fell sharply, further easing market sentiment. As a result, prices for all months fell by an additional five fen (cents) to one jiao (cent) compared to the morning's closing prices. Yi Chang sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. Sales included 400 dan (unit of weight) from Dafeng Che Wu, 2,100 dan (unit of weight) from Runkang, 1,900 dan (unit of weight) from Dachang, 1,100 dan (unit of weight) from Tonghe, 1,800 dan (unit of weight) from Yuda, 600 dan (unit of weight) from Yuan Yi, and 680 dan (unit of weight) from Chenfeng. Purchases included 700 dan (unit of weight) from Tongji, 300 dan (unit of weight) from Yuan Yi, 500 dan (unit of weight) from Changhe, 100 dan (unit of weight) from Wang Taixing, and 300 dan (unit of weight) from Yikang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.

Spot Cotton Transactions Limited to Over 400 Pieces of Linbao

Spot cotton consumption has become sluggish, with factories showing little interest. Supplies include 600 yuan of Yao cotton and 545 bales of Tong cotton.

Slight Changes to the Grading of Cotton Yarn for the May Term

At the end of January, the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened the 137th grading meeting for cotton yarn and cotton to review various grades for the purpose of delivery for the May 1937 term. As a result of the inspection, slight changes were made, with the grade of 20-count yarn produced by Tianjin No. 4 Yarn Factory raised by one level. New additions include 16-count and 10-count Shengping brand yarn produced by Wuxi Zhenye Factory, and 10-count Fugui brand yarn produced by Hengfeng Factory. The details of the changes are listed below.

Mixed Price Movements for Three Grades of Cotton Yarn

According to a dispatch from Osaka today: spot yarn is up three yuan; 16-count Fanmian remains unchanged at 250 yuan; 20-count Jinyu remains unchanged at 270 yuan; 40-count Wuxing remains unchanged at 415 yuan; 42-count Zhizi is up three yuan at 405 yuan. Three grades of yarn futures are up four jiao (cents) to two yuan six jiao (cents), with the near-month contract at 264 yuan three jiao (cents) and the far-month contract at 260 yuan. Cotton futures are up and down two jiao (cents), with the near-month contract at 75 yuan nine jiao five fen (cents) and the far-month contract at 79 yuan two jiao five fen (cents).

The Bombay cloth market is slightly weak. The market prices are as follows:

### Piece Goods

Southwest Still Procuring Cotton Cloth

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market softened slightly due to the sharp drop of three yuan in marked yarn prices. Sales prices for various goods were generally stable, but fine Eastern cloths fell slightly (per bolt) by about five fen (cents) in the afternoon. Inland trading houses and dyeing factories had already absorbed a large amount last week, and their interest in procurement has weakened. Most trading houses from nearby regions are preparing for the New Year and are shipping little. Trading houses from Shandong in the North are still showing good interest and are consistently purchasing printed tribute drill and serge from factories such as Lunchang and Hengfeng, with 30 to 40 cases being procured daily. Plain serge, straight tribute, and line twill are also being procured at a rate of over one hundred cases and are being declared for export one after another. Trading houses from Tianjin are mainly collecting light-weight plain silk fabrics, mostly for hoarding in Shanghai. The Southwest, including Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong, is relatively active. Yesterday, Guangdong trading houses procured over 500 pieces of general merchandise, including fine cloths, fine twills, coarse cloths, and coarse twills, as well as several hundred cases of patterned goods such as satin, cloqué, silk twill, line twill, fine cloths, and bleached cloth. Trading houses from Sichuan and Yunnan also procured over 300 pieces. Local wholesalers and dyeing factories also procured over 200 pieces of fine cloths and fine twills, which is a significant decrease compared to last week. 84 grey cloth—the price of the pound-weighted market cloth is still firm, with prices still rising by five fen (cents).

### Cavalry Twill Plummets by One Yuan

Although the sales of cavalry twill are currently more active than heavy fabrics such as overcoat cloth, demand has already decreased, and the quantity of new purchases is limited. Market inventories are sufficient, and domestic manufacturers are shipping large quantities of goods. General wholesalers have not yet sold the goods they originally imported at high prices, resulting in an average drop of one yuan per yard. Yesterday, Zhang's cavalry twill fell to five yuan six jiao (cents), while Qiahe Xinxin's was at five yuan two jiao three fen (cents), and Dawu's goods were at four yuan four jiao (cents).

### Grains

Recent Flour Fluctuations See Some Replenishment

No Auctions Were Held for May and June Yesterday; Prices for July Futures Rose Significantly in the Afternoon

Yesterday in the flour market, prices for all months showed a uniform rebound. Due to the reported prices of foreign wheat, which increased by two, three, or four jiao (cents) in Chicago and six or seven jiao (cents) in Canada and one penny in Liverpool during the two days the market was closed, market sentiment for all months strengthened after the opening of trading, rebounding by two or three fen (cents) compared to the closing prices at the end of the previous month. Trading in various contracts was quite active due to the closing out of positions by both buyers and sellers. Auctions were not held for May and June contracts due to the new and old crop situation. The July contracts, representing the new crop, were auctioned, initially opening at three yuan four jiao three fen (cents) and then rising by two or three fen (cents). During the morning opening, near-term contracts continued to perform well, rising by one or two fen (cents) due to short covering and replenishment by small factories. However, July contracts saw a surge in buying from large outside players, who arbitrarily raised prices regardless of the timing, causing them to rise by eight or nine fen (cents) compared to the initial morning prices. This was largely due to the significant difference in market value between the new and old crops, which attracted the attention of speculators.

### Spot Wheat Sales Still Awaiting a Profitable Turnaround

Yesterday in the wheat futures market, due to the reported prices of foreign wheat, which had rebounded by one jiao three fen (cents) to six jiao seven fen (cents), market sentiment inevitably changed. Although spot wheat sales for near-term contracts were not robust, trading by general customers was focused on closing out positions due to the approaching settlement date. As a result, buying interest was relatively strong. In the afternoon opening, trading in old wheat became quiet, while trading in new wheat for June and July was more active due to the positive performance of the flour market, and prices also rose by two or three fen (cents). New standard contracts for July were also auctioned, with an initial price of five yuan two jiao three fen (cents) and a better closing price of two fen (cents). Both spot arrivals and sales were sluggish, requiring a profitable turnaround before activity can resume.

Short Supply, River Rice Prices Rise by Three Jiao

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few sources of supply from various routes downriver, only about twenty. The weather cleared up in the morning, and there was a lot of rice on the market, which caused the sales of various goods to be active. The market price of high-quality white glutinous rice increased by several fen (cents), while the price of medium and low-quality rice increased by three jiao (cents). The price of thin indica rice rose by one jiao (cent), and Futao followed suit, rising by one or two jiao (cents). The price of Yangdujian increased by about one jiao (cent), and the price of river port rice remained tight. The prices of other goods were also firm.

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, due to the obstruction of wind and rain, few goods arrived from various sources, with only about two thousand three hundred shi (unit of volume) from ten or so suppliers. Among them were four or five suppliers of thin indica rice, so market sentiment became even stronger. Although sales on this street were limited, with only a few hundred packages purchased by the Qingdao trading house, the market situation continued to be firm. The price of thick glutinous rice continued to rise by two jiao (cents), thin indica rice rose by about one jiao (cent), and Duyangjian also rose by one jiao (cent), while the price of Yinbianyuan remained flat.

Rice Available, But No Ships to Guangdong

Yesterday, the market for customer indica rice was weak and sluggish again. Due to a lack of shipping capacity, the Yue trading house only made token purchases of one hundred packages of late-harvested brown rice. The Shantou trading house also made a few token purchases of Jiyuan rice. There were no inquiries from other trading houses in Xiamen and the north, so the market turned slightly soft again. Sellers were willing to cut prices by three to five fen (cents) to sell their goods. Demand on this street was still good, but prices were tight. With few days left in the year, it may be difficult for the market to recover. A total of 5,280 packages of Jiangxi rice, 435 packages of Hunan rice, and no other transactions were made throughout the day.

Spring and Autumn

### Travels to Baotu Spring

— (Xuewen)

Due to a chance encounter, I once passed through Jinan. Upon hearing that the train station was "not far from Baotu Spring," a mere ten-minute rickshaw ride away, I was irresistibly drawn. A few of us spent an hour paying homage to this long-admired scenic spot.

Is this "Baotu Spring"? It appeared in such a chaotic and dusty place. "Imagination" is unreliable after all!

A bridge spans the center of the spring, with many people coming and going. A wooden frame resembling a gate stands on the bridge, inscribed with the words "Old Site of Penglai Mountain." It appears quite ancient. Suddenly, I became aware of a crisp sound reaching my ears. The spring water was so clear and crystal-like, as if it were a spotless saint. Several larger spring vents churned out rolling white waves, surging upwards in clumps with tremendous force. Water droplets splashed everywhere, truly like grains of pearls and gems, rolling down. It was as if a "jade flower" planted by divine hands bloomed luxuriantly all day long without fading. Silky green water lined with silvery-white water splashes, so clear and beautiful! As for the smaller spring vents, they shot out strands of white water lines, never ceasing! Closing my eyes and only listening to the sound of the waves, the magnificent momentum was like ten thousand horses galloping, overturning mountains and seas, making one wonder where they were!

It is said that "the spring water is especially clear, cool, sweet, and refreshing," but unfortunately, we did not bring cups and could not taste the nectar!

Standing on the bridge, we savored this exquisite charm. "What a spectacle!" An exclamation of praise spontaneously escaped our lips.

On the way back, I secretly rejoiced: this trip was not in vain!

### Great Snow at Tangchi

— Xu Hengren

Among China's hot springs, Huangshan is the most famous. The pool of the hot spring is also called Tangchi (hot spring pool), located on Purple Cloud Peak. The pool is 15 feet long, six feet wide, and about four feet deep. In the seams of the stone walls of the pool, there is a trickle of cold spring water flowing into the pool to adjust the temperature. There is a hidden hole to the left of the bathing area. After bathing, the grime is drained through this hole and flows directly into Peach Blossom Creek, and then from Peach Blossom Creek to Xiaoyao Creek (Carefree Creek). In the three seasons of spring, summer, and autumn, many people come here to bathe, but in winter, the number gradually decreases. When it snows heavily, there are even fewer than one or two people.

I live in Tangkou Village, below Tangchi. That day, the wind howled fiercely in the forenoon, and dense clouds covered the sky. In the afternoon, it snowed heavily, with flakes falling from the sky one by one. I and six young boys braved the snow and set off up the mountain. Looking up at the high peaks, they resembled a white-haired old man standing in the clouds. Looking down at the numerous high and low hillsides, they were all covered with thick cotton wool—like many jade trees and fairy grasses, glittering and arranged along the road—the Xiaoyao Creek and Peach Blossom Creek below the road were also a silvery white—it was truly like entering Peach Blossom Spring and experiencing carefree joy.

Before we finished admiring the scenery, we had already arrived at Tangchi. The water in the pool seemed to be rising even more heatedly than usual—everyone took off their clothes and went into the pool naked. The young boys swam back and forth in the pool, playing non-stop. I also sat on the stone on the edge of the pool, letting the warm water wash over me, sweating all over, extremely refreshed—after getting up and putting on my clothes, I felt light as a feather, as if I had become an immortal, and my spirits had increased several times!

It was getting late, so we returned by the same route, singing Cen Shen's Song of the White Snow on the way: "The north wind rolls up the earth, and the white grass breaks, the barbarian sky is already snowing in August... only horse tracks remain on the snow!" The boys followed by singing the Snow Marching Song: "Brother's towel makes a good flag; younger brother's bamboo pole makes a good horse; the Zou brothers take up their guns and go to the mountains to play soldiers... 400 million people enjoy peace..." We sang and walked downhill. When we got home, the lights were already lit; the yellow rice and green vegetables were cooked!

### The Linggu Temple in Winter

— Zhang Zhenxiang

The scenery of Linggu Temple outside Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing is serene and secluded. From the perspective of its lush and verdant myriad appearances, it is somewhat inferior to the Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou. However, with the completion of the Memorial Tower for the fallen soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army, and the historical and commemorative significance of the place, even in this season of chilling north winds, Linggu Temple is still worth a visit after visiting the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and the Tan Yankai Tomb!

When the autumn colors of Xuanwu Lake have faded, the winter scenery of Nanjing is clearly centered around Linggu Temple. Although Nanjing had not yet been blessed with a heavy snowfall to adorn the New Year before Christmas, the temperature had already dropped below forty degrees Fahrenheit indoors. Two days before the Winter Solstice, we saw ice columns hanging four or five inches long from the eaves behind the Zhenqi Hall of Linggu Temple. This had not yet been seen in the city, naturally because it snowed a few days ago, and the snow on the shady side, especially under these towering eaves, slowly melted and condensed into ice columns! Although these are somewhat bloated and sluggish lines in the winter landscape, they simply and clearly tell us: they are lines unique to winter!

Linggu Temple originally had the "Three Perfections Stele," which I had unsuccessfully searched for some time ago. Now, with some trees withering, reducing some places of attachment, I had more time to search carefully. Sure enough, in the incense hall dedicated to the so-called Baogong Bodhisattva, I found a stele lying horizontally on the ground. The image of Baogong painted by Wu Daozi, combined with the ode written by Li Bai, and the calligraphy of Yan Zhenqing became the "Three Perfections." After being carved in stone in the Tang Dynasty, it was re-engraved in the Yuan Dynasty. During the Xuande period of the Ming Dynasty, when Linggu Temple was completely destroyed, the Three Perfections Stele also "perished" at the same time. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, old rubbings were re-copied and carved. This newly carved "Three Perfections Stele" is a re-copy of the old Qing Dynasty collection of rubbings. I don't know how many editions it has been copied, so the magical aspects have naturally been greatly diminished.

In addition to the large iron scissors, a bell near Jinsi Pavilion can be considered somewhat ancient. The rusty color reveals that this bell was made during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty (approximately the auspicious day of the first month of the 24th year), originally from the Guanyin Hall. The necessary characters such as "dust and water are solid," "the imperial way is far-reaching," "the Dharma wheel turns constantly," and "the Buddha's sun shines brightly" are all clearly visible on the bell. Many newly cast tripods are also placed in another corner of the temple, which is a pleasing contrast.

### The Usurped Phoenix

— By Zhang Henshui

Chapter 10 (Silk Handkerchief Sends Strange Patterns, Yellow Flowers Face Withering; Autumn Letters Add to Sorrow)

Little Chrysanthemum stood by his side, twisting the corner of his clothes with two fingers, staring with two small eyes, just looking at him. Then, he also looked out of the window, wondering what there was. But besides the azure sky with a few white clouds floating, there was really nothing else. It was a bit incomprehensible why the young lady was looking so intently. So, in various ways, she called out "Miss" again. Menglan finally turned her face to look at him, asking: What's the matter with you again? I'm already annoyed, and you come to bother me? Little Chrysanthemum's words were just on the tip of his tongue, but he was stopped by this scolding. So, she put a finger on his lips, smiling: Madam told me to come and see if Miss is sick? Menglan laughed: Look, am I sick? I'm a perfectly healthy person, what kind of illness would I have? Little Chrysanthemum pouted: It's not like I wanted to ask, and you're blaming me. She turned around and walked towards the door. Menglan said: Come back, come back. Little Chrysanthemum held the door, pouting: You always want me by your side, but you always want to scold me. Menglan laughed: Why would I scold you? But you also shouldn't be so nosy, thinking that everything is good to know. Little Chrysanthemum said: I don't want to be nosy at all. When I see you with that worried look, I get scared, how dare I be nosy? Menglan asked again: Why did Madam tell you to ask me this question? Little Chrysanthemum said: Madam also saw your worried look and suspected you were sick. Menglan thought for a while, then laughed again: Speaking of my worried look? Every day of the year, I'm like this, it can't be that I'm sick every day, right? You go tell Madam, I'm not sick. Little Chrysanthemum stood there and looked at her for a while, seeing her still staring at the willow tree outside the window. She thought to herself, this is strange. There's nothing outside, what is she always looking at? Menglan said: What are you staring at here? Go downstairs. Little Chrysanthemum was urged to go downstairs and went straight to Madam Jiang's room. Madam Jiang was also chatting with the two young mistresses, and when she saw Little Chrysanthemum coming in, she quickly asked: Has Miss gone to sleep? Little Chrysanthemum pouted again: Don't even mention it, as soon as I asked that question, I got scolded by Miss. She said she's worried like this every day of the year, it can't be that she's sick every day. It's like I'm being too nosy by asking this question. Madam Jiang smiled: That's because you asked the question improperly, how can you ask a perfectly healthy person if they're sick or not. Little Chrysanthemum took a step closer and leaned next to Madam Jiang, whispering: Ah! Miss is probably really sick. She doesn't read books, doesn't write, sits by the table, with his eyes staring straight at the outside of the window. In fact, there's nothing outside the window. I don't understand why she's looking so intently. (130)

### Two-Day Trip to Tongjiang

— Chen Xiaocui

Heavy rain over the great river, ascend the upper floor,
The wind is high, the jade flute plays a moving tune,
The first Immortal Tong starts downstream,
Clearly marking the boundary between the turbid and the pure stream.

A dangerous bridge over thousands of valleys wrinkles the fish patterns,
From a secluded place, green mountains exhale chaotic clouds,
The Emperor sent for him, but he could not be summoned,
Drunk and asleep, fearing to disturb the stars.

Water and sky like ink, cross the river,
Ten thousand silver shads return at the right time,
(The Yangtze River shad returns from Fishing Terrace)
A long flute sounds, the mountain greenery falls,
Braving the wind and rain, ascending West Terrace.

The mountain twists, and stone steps number in the thousands,
The emaciated likeness reveals a guest star,
The Han Dynasty has no inch of land left,
Fishing Terrace will forever belong to this gentleman.

Wind and rain desolate the terrace, myriad images are precarious,
Who is loyal and loving, dying for his ruler?
Vast and moving cries fill the time of war,
Heaven and earth endure, a commoner to the end.

Below the cliff, no one, only empty waves,
Pitifully drying his hair towards the sunny slope,
Who would know that Xie Lingyun lamented at West Terrace,
Also the righteous song of Wen Tianxiang. (The above two poems are in memory of Xie Gao)

### Zhou Pavilion in Changzhou

— Huang Junying

Mr. Su Dongpo was a famous person of the Song Dynasty. His poems, essays, calligraphy, and paintings were all highly regarded by later generations. He was not originally from Sichuan, and he had held high office. However, because he was a scholar with a free and easy spirit, he resigned from his position and traveled far. He left many traces in Changzhou, but due to the passage of time, many have been buried. Only a part remains at the Yizhou Pavilion.

Yizhou Pavilion is located in the eastern suburbs of Changzhou, about several hundred steps from the city. The scenery here is very beautiful. The Grand Canal surrounds it, and it faces the river on three sides. The riverbank is lined with sparse willows. Mr. Su Dongpo stayed here for a long time. On the surrounding walls of the pavilion are embedded many bluestones, on which are engraved poems and lyrics, chiseled by stonemasons. These are Dongpo's handwriting. Due to erosion by wind and rain, they are already incomplete, and the local people do not know how to take care of them, which is regrettable!

In the southeast corner of the pavilion, there is a wisteria tree, which is said to have been planted by Dongpo. It still winds along the wall, with luxuriant branches and leaves. During the spring and summer, people often sit under the wisteria to sip tea, admiring the beautiful scenery while thinking of Mr. Dongpo.

Below the undulating rockery stones, there is also a wash-ink pond, which never dries up throughout the year. The spring water is crystal clear. In the middle of the rockery stones, there are three words: "Wash-ink Pond," which is also Dongpo's handwriting. Many people, when they visit here, take some ink-wash water back to their children and grandchildren, hoping to impart some of Mr. Dongpo's literary talent. Although it is superstitious, it is also very interesting!

### Moonlight Bathing Pool on Gulangyu Island

— Qiuwen

Recently, I read an article in an American sports magazine about the "Moonlight Bathing Movement in Chicago". This reminded me of the creation of this type of moonlight bathing pool in my hometown of Gulangyu Island twelve years ago. When I returned to my hometown last year, I still saw the existence of this bathing pool, but it has gradually declined in recent years.

The period of discovering the moonlight bathing pool was in the summer of 1925. Because there are very few public bathing pools in the Xiamen area, and the general public cannot find a place to bathe, the wonderful idea of some White Russian wanderers was aroused. They rented a private pond on Gulangyu Island, paved a layer of stone bricks at the bottom of the pool, built a short fence around it, and also built a sprinkler in the pool. An advertisement for the opening of a moonlight bathing pool was published in the Xiamen newspaper. Because the price was only five Hong Kong cents, and soap and towels were not charged, it was so comfortable and cool for the general public in the surrounding area to be able to bathe in such a cool pond under the bright moon at night after finishing work under the scorching sun during the day! Sure enough, everyone flocked to it, and business also developed accordingly, which aroused the covetousness of local businessmen. These types of bathing pools then sprang up like mushrooms after the rain in various places. However, because these ponds were not common, they had to invest a large amount of capital to purchase land and dig. They also boasted in the newspapers: how the pool water was disinfected, how attentive the attendants were, which attracted everyone's attention. As expected, the general customers gradually changed from the common people to the middle and upper classes.

When I left my hometown, it was the most developed time for the moonlight bathing pool. I remember a wealthy merchant from Gulangyu Island invested tens of thousands of capital to open a magnificent moonlight bathing pool, with washing rooms and rest rooms outside the pool. Not a few customers came by car and horse, but the price of each bath was about two to four cents, and the poor could not afford to go.

Later, because I left my hometown, I could not pay attention to its rise and fall. It was not until I saw a newspaper from Hong Kong a few years ago that the moonlight bathing pools in the Gulangyu area were operating miserably. Imitating the method of Turkish baths, they hired women to serve as attendants. As a result, after being discovered by the authorities for secret prostitution, some of them were ordered to close down. When I returned to my hometown last year, I still saw a few moonlight bathing pools, but the bathing pools were already indoors instead of outdoors, and naturally they had fundamentally lost their original appearance.

### Tomb of Zhaojun

— Jian Chen

Thirty miles south of Guihua (the old city of Suiyuan) in Suiyuan, there lies an eternally fragrant tomb, which is the tomb of Wang Zhaojun, one of the four great beauties of China.

This tomb covers a large area, about thirty acres in circumference, and is about twenty zhang high. In front of the tomb stands a tall stele, inscribed with "Tomb of Mingfei of the Han Dynasty." On both sides of the tomb, there are six or seven ancient and dilapidated steles, but unfortunately, due to the ravages of time and weather, the inscriptions on the steles are no longer very clear. There are also quite a few steles erected by modern people, such as those by Ma Fuxiang, Ji Hongchang, and Li Peiji, among which the one erected by Ji is the most striking, with the four characters "Shame of a Coward."

The borderland is covered with yellow reeds, and the grass is all white, but only the grass on Zhaojun's tomb appears verdant. From a distance, it is shrouded in mist, which is quite lovely. Poets of the Tang Dynasty also mentioned it repeatedly, the most famous of which are the following two poems. Du Fu's "Three Poems of Remembering Ancient Sites": "A group of mountains and valleys rush to Jingmen, and there is still a village where Mingfei grew up. Once she left the Zilai and went to the northern desert, only a green tomb remains facing the twilight." Liu Fangping's "Complaint of a Soldier": "Step by step, the Jin River returns to Yuguan, and morning after morning, the horse whip and the knife ring. In the spring, white snow returns to the green tomb, and ten thousand miles of the Yellow River surrounds the Black Mountain."

Zhaojun was a native of Xigui City in Hubei, but her fragrant bones were buried in Suiyuan. Therefore, it is necessary to briefly describe her early history.

Zhaojun, whose surname was Wang and given name was Qiang, was born with elegance and beauty. Many people from her village sought her hand in marriage, but she refused them all. At the age of seventeen, she was selected by Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty to enter the palace as a beautiful woman. However, there were too many women in the harem, so she could not be seen. Therefore, the emperor ordered the painter Mao Yanshou to paint portraits of the women and summoned them according to the paintings. The palace women all bribed Mao, but Qiang, confident in her beauty, refused to bribe him, so she was not seen. When the Xiongnu came to seek a beautiful woman, Qiang, resentful of not being seen by the emperor after entering the palace, angrily requested to go. At the time of parting, Emperor Yuan saw that Qiang's appearance was beautiful and well-adorned, and her radiance shone brightly, resembling a lingering shadow. He was fascinated by her, and greatly regretted it, but he could not break his promise. He could only watch her leave for the border, holding a pipa in her arms.

Du Fu also commented on this matter in a poem: "The spring breeze face is recognized through the painting, and the jade pendants return to the moonlit soul in vain. For a thousand years, the pipa speaks the language of the barbarians, clearly discussing resentment in the melody."

Zhaojun, in a moment of anger, was willing to leave her homeland to marry the Xiongnu, but after living there for a while, she found that she could not get used to the life of eating meat and drinking milk. Therefore, she was moved by the thought of her homeland and wrote a poem to express her sorrow: "Autumn trees are lush, their leaves withered and yellow; there is an island on the mountain, gathered on the mulberry bushes. They raise their feathers and give light to their appearance; having risen into the clouds, they ascend to the winding chambers. Although the palace is desolate, their bodies are devastated; their aspirations are broken, and they cannot fly freely. Although they are given food, they must be uneasy; why am I alone, changing constantly? Fluttering in fright, they gather far away in the west; the high mountains are towering, and the river is vast. Father and mother, the road is long; alas, I am saddened, and my heart is grieved."

In addition, she wrote a letter to Emperor Yuan, which said: "Your servant is fortunate to be in the service of the imperial court, thinking that my body is close to the sun and moon, and that I will have lasting fragrance even in death. But I lost favor due to the paintings and was exiled to a foreign land. I am truly willing to sacrifice myself to repay the emperor, and how dare I pity myself? I only regret that the country's promotion and demotion are based on lowly craftsmen, and looking south at the Han court only increases my sorrow. I have a father and a brother, I only hope that Your Majesty will show them some pity." Emperor Yuan was greatly moved by the painting and angrily ordered the painter Mao Yanshou and others to be executed, but what was the use? This beautiful woman could still not be taken back from the Xiongnu.

In conclusion, Zhaojun's exile to a foreign land was partly due to her resentment at not being seen by the emperor when she was in the palace, but the biggest reason was the weakness of the country. I think that if the court had the strength to resist the Xiongnu at that time, they would not have allowed them to demand a beautiful woman, and Zhaojun would not have been sacrificed on the border.

Today, the situation in Suiyuan is turbulent again, and the Han soldiers are fighting fiercely with the bandits in the icy and snowy land. I wonder if this beauty who served the country in the past would know about it in the afterlife?

### Problems in the Implementation of Health Education in China (Continued)

— Lin Jingcheng (Speaker), Yin Zhanwu (Recorder)

F. Selection of Health Education Personnel

The main body of health education personnel should be the cooperation between the health and education sectors. At the same time, the following key points must be paid attention to during implementation: (1) They must gain the trust of the people: (They themselves must set an example.) (2) They must live the same life as the people: (3) Considerable attention must be paid to the cultivation of personal morality.

G. Methods of Implementing Health Education

As mentioned earlier, the implementation of health education in China cannot simply imitate foreign countries. Now I will write down a few points that China can do and must pay attention to:

(1) Health education should correspond to facts: Implementing health education is not just empty talk, it should be done as it is said; what is said and what is done must be consistent. As for action, it is also a kind of education. This kind of instilling health knowledge through action is dynamic health education. At the same time, health education also depends on the power of construction. For example, in environmental sanitation, people are advised not to spit or urinate everywhere. However, if there are no public spittoons and toilets, even if you use all your strength, you will not be able to achieve efficiency. Therefore, the implementation of health education must also focus on construction, such as education. (Due to economic limitations in our country, some constructions cannot be fulfilled as desired.)

(2) Health education should be coordinated with social and economic conditions, people's lifestyles, and people's needs: In the past, people who implemented health education often had ideals that were too high, and in practice, there were many examples of facts that could not be accepted. For example, if the poor are malnourished, you advise them to eat more milk and eggs. Please think, the poor still cannot solve the problem of "just trying to get enough to eat"! How can they accept eggs and milk?

As for the materials for health education, of course, it is also necessary to have a considerable relationship with the people being educated! Therefore, if the educated can accept it, then action can also occur; and finally, resonance will inevitably be aroused. Therefore, the materials for health education must meet the needs of the people, and the power of health education must be a prerequisite for improving the people's economy and life.

(3) Health education should take into account the people's knowledge and interests: Since more than 80% of the people in our country are illiterate, of course, their interest in health will also be reduced! Therefore, the materials must also be simplified, popular, interesting, and elementary. In short, if they can meet the needs of the people, they will definitely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, from this, we can know that the effect of posting slogans and distributing manuals is definitely not as good as using folk songs, storytelling, magic tricks, as well as using health pictures, health movies, masquerade performances, and health gifts to carry out various publicity and education; the former can make the people feel bored and ignorant! The latter can arouse the people's interest as a principle.

(4) Health education should make full use of social assistance: Health education can use the baojia system to help promote it, such as organizing various gatherings; but all must be on the premise of not hindering the people's work. In addition, it is also a good method to promote health education during the people's regular gatherings and the New Year's holiday so that everyone is interested!

H. Conclusion

In short, the implementation of health education in China is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed! Health education is a magic medicine to improve the health of the people! Although there are many difficulties in promoting it and its effects are not obvious, we must know that magic medicine is not a divine prescription or a magic charm, and it cannot be effective immediately. Because education is a kind of stimulation! Slight or small amounts of stimulation cannot immediately have a great effect; of course, the progress of health education is also accumulated bit by bit; health habits are also formed after several stimulations. (For example, the matter of "please do not spit everywhere" is not easy for Chinese people to develop; because this kind of habit is really not achieved in a day! It takes a long time to develop.) Therefore, looking at it this way, those who are engaged in health education must have perseverance! Their vision must look to the distance! We must know that health stimulation often needs to be maintained for decades before it can show its effect. Therefore, the success of China's health cause today can be half attributed to the efforts of the people in the past few decades! Our efforts today will also be the foundation for the success of others in the future! I hope that all comrades will continue to work hard in this direction.

### Common Sense Questions and Answers on Diseases

— Cheng Chaozhang

(100) Diseases of the Pituitary Gland (Part 1)

Q: In which part of the body is the pituitary gland located? What are its physiological functions?

A: The pituitary gland is located below the brain and is an endocrine gland. It is divided into three parts: the anterior lobe, the intermediate lobe, and the posterior lobe. Each part has its own special physiological functions. The anterior lobe is related to the development of bones and gonads. The intermediate lobe is related to the body's metabolism. The hormones secreted by the posterior lobe can contract the uterus to increase labor pains, contract blood vessels to raise blood pressure, and inhibit diuresis in diabetes insipidus.

Q: What symptoms occur when the pituitary gland is diseased?

A: When the pituitary gland becomes diseased, there are many kinds of diseases, which is because the diseased parts are different. Common diseases include acromegaly, gigantism, dwarfism, adiposogenital dystrophy, diabetes insipidus, and cachexia.

Q: What is acromegaly?

A: This is a disease recorded by the French physician Pierre Marie in 1886. The cause lies in the hyperfunction and abnormality of the pituitary gland.

Q: What are the symptoms of acromegaly?

A: It mainly affects young people and starts very slowly. In women, menstruation stops, and they experience general fatigue, headaches, and pain in the limbs. Later, the face begins to change, with the nose, lips, and chin becoming swollen and protruding, resulting in a strange appearance. The zygomatic arch also protrudes. The limbs also develop abnormally, with the fingers and toes becoming swollen, and the terminal phalanges also becoming very thick. The spine flexes backward in the neck. The gonads stop functioning, and there is sugar in the urine, as well as myxedema. In such patients, there must be swelling and pain in the pituitary gland, and the sella turcica sinks and expands.

Q: Are there different degrees of severity of this disease?

A: There is a type of incomplete acromegaly, which only retains a familial predisposition to the disease or only causes swelling in the tongue and thumb, etc., which is called localized acromegaly.

Q: How long does this disease last?

A: It progresses very slowly and eventually leads to cachexia and death.

Q: How is acromegaly treated?

A: Try X-ray irradiation or surgery. Pituitary or thyroid preparations are ineffective.

Q: What are the symptoms of gigantism?

A: It is caused by hyperfunction of the pituitary gland in childhood and adolescence. It usually affects more men. The symptoms are similar to those of acromegaly and is also known as early-onset acromegaly.

Q: What are the symptoms of dwarfism caused by pituitary gland disease?

A: Dwarfism is the opposite of acromegaly and is caused by incomplete development of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The symptoms are that the body is completely like a child, and bone development stops. Gonadal development is incomplete, and secondary sexual characteristics are lacking, but mental development is generally good.

Q: Which diseases should it be distinguished from in diagnosis?

A: It should be distinguished from childhood physique, thyroid dwarfism, rickets, and achondroplasia.

Q: How is pituitary dwarfism treated?

A: Antituitrin, a preparation of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, can be injected.

### Talking About Cancer (5)

— Xiaozu

All the treatments have been briefly mentioned above. Here is a simple restatement.

(1) Use radium radiation to eliminate the vitality of cancer cells, causing them to collapse and disappear on their own. (Mesothorium) is the same.

(2) Use X-rays. The principle is the same as above.

(3) Use strong sunlight or electric light, such as a carbon arc lamp (Bogenlicht) or high-voltage, high-frequency electricity.

(4) Use drugs, such as Atoxyl (an arsenic preparation) and sodium and potassium taken internally.

(5) Use serum and enzymes.

(6) Use homologous autolysates. Such as Fischera 365 by the Italian doctor Fischera.

(7) Use heavy metals

The medicines currently available on the market, such as Sichera 365 and the French Neolysis P. O. U., etc., various countries have wonder drugs, but they are too numerous to mention. They are only for show. They can be used as an adjunct to physical therapy, but it is difficult to believe in them alone!

Cancer is such a serious and difficult problem in medicine and human health, second only to tuberculosis (Tbc) and leprosy (Lepra). Of course, all countries in the world have considerable history and efforts in dealing with this problem. There are many research institutes established by public and private sectors, and each has considerable achievements, but they have not yet reached the final result!

We now have only two hopes for this problem: (1) the pathogen, knowing it, we can think of fundamental ways to deal with it, or embark on the road to research, (2) the beginning of the etiology of cancer, knowing it, we can think of ways to prevent it. We are sure that these dream-like hopes will be realized one day, and the saying "only fear those who have the will" can be our guarantee. There are many enthusiastic, compassionate, and intelligent people in this world. There are also many enthusiastic and responsible adults and gentlemen in the government and among the people. If we can gather our strength and cooperate to create an agency that does practical things and specializes in researching this disease, it will also be a supreme act of kindness to win honor for the country and seek happiness for all mankind. Some may say that there is already a collaboration in China, and the Lester Institute and the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences are already concerned and working for us, so there is no need to waste our efforts. Or perhaps there is a sigh of talent shortage! However, everything has a beginning! - Scholarship has no borders is just a beautiful saying after all!

The author is young and has limited knowledge. This article is only for popular understanding, and it is inevitable that it will be a laughing stock. I respectfully ask experts to correct me at any time. The books I consulted do not need to be listed in detail! (End)

### The Past and Present of Medicine and Health in Haining County (Continued)

— Xia Canglin

The Rampancy of Venereal Diseases

The prevalence of venereal diseases in cities is directly proportional to the prosperity of the market. However, in the declining and bankrupt rural areas, venereal diseases are rampant. Readers may consider my words to be arrogant. However, based on actual evidence, the spread of venereal diseases in the interior has indeed surpassed the upper class and penetrated into the countryside. Is this a special phenomenon in my Haining, or is it the same everywhere? I dare not make a decisive statement. However, according to clinical experience and actual statistical surveys, the number of venereal disease patients in the interior is increasing year by year and has a strong tendency to penetrate into the tenant farmers. (I published an article "Venereal Diseases Have Gone to the Tenant Farmers" a few years ago, hoping to urge those who are concerned about social and national health to pay attention to it.) According to the speculation, the reason here is probably because after the severe drought in the 23rd year, many farmers begged for food in other places, and many young rural women were forced by life to go astray. This is one reason. Haining County has a very developed small-scale industry (such as sock weaving, etc.). Rural women use sock-weaving machines, admire the prosperity of the city, and engage in improper lifestyles. This is another reason. Others are due to husbands working in cities, contracting venereal diseases, or relatives and friends serving in other places, bringing back diseases. Farmers' lives are still difficult to satisfy. After contracting venereal diseases, they will not seek medical treatment unless absolutely necessary. Even if they seek medical treatment, it is only a temporary measure, and there is no chance of a radical cure. Moreover, farmers have weak knowledge and simple lives. Every family, young and old, often share the same bed and quilt. Therefore, from one person to the whole family, from one family to one village, it is not difficult for a small spark to start a prairie fire in a few years. Then, the spread of venereal diseases in the rural areas of Haining is not accidental.

The Chinese and Western Medicine and Relief Organizations in the County

The doctors in Haining County, like those in other counties, are mostly old doctors, with a small portion of new doctors. There are about 100 old doctors in the county, and only one-fifth of them are new doctors. The following is a list of the hospitals in the county (other individual practices are not fully recorded)

Four-fifths of the old doctors specialize in internal medicine, and half of them are in the area of Xia Shi. There is a Chinese Medicine Association, and recently, a branch of the National Medicine Association is being planned. The power is not weak. Because of the development of old medicine, the related Chinese medicine shops are also thriving. There are no less than 100 pharmacies in the county. The annual turnover is far beyond the reach of Western pharmacies. In particular, the Chinese medicine stores such as Jiuda Yong, Wanyuan, Guangsheng, and Wu Caizhi in Xia Shi are even more prosperous. These stores mainly wholesale. The annual turnover is more than 100,000 yuan at most and at least 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Unfortunately, many Chinese medicines in recent years are imported. Otherwise, it would be possible to recover a part of the interests.

All the Western pharmacies in the county are in the Xia Shi area, with a total of three. In other areas, most of the stores sell foreign goods concurrently.

Xia Shi Area

Asian Pharmacy, Sino-French Pharmacy, also sells raw materials and needle medicines, annual turnover of about 30,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan

Hua Mei Pharmacy only sells alternative medicines, annual turnover of about 10,000 yuan

Regarding relief work, although each area has a relief center, it is a variation of the baby care hall, mainly for accommodating babies. All equipment is not perfect. Other charitable people organize gatherings to distribute clothes, porridge, and materials on a regular basis. However, it is only related to poverty alleviation, and there is no medical relief organization. Among the private hospitals, Sheng Sheng and Hui De hospitals distribute free medical examination vouchers every year, but they are aimed at helping the rural areas, so they are only limited to poor and sick farmers, and the number is very small, which is a drop in the bucket and of course does not help. The Xia Shi Chinese Medicine Association takes turns sending doctors and medicines every summer, but this year, due to the difficulty in raising funds, it has reduced its scope and restricted the distribution of medicines. I once planned to contact the new medical community to organize a medical relief organization, but due to various difficulties, it was not realized for a while. I still regret it.

Haining's Health Funding

Haining's health funding has always been lacking. Although each area has items such as sanitation fees, they have been canceled or changed to this day. Even if they are preserved, there are only a few each month, which is only used for sanitation and does not involve other health construction. Even each epidemic prevention mostly relies on temporary fundraising. In October of the 19th year, the Civil Affairs Department instructed the Haining County Government to approve the collection of health donations from shop and house donations (about a few cents per household) to be used as a reserve for the county hospital. In the 23rd year, there was an organization of the County Hospital Preparatory Committee. At that time, I was also a committee member, but after one or two meetings, I have not seen a summons, and the county hospital or clinic has not been established. According to my opinion, based on Haining's financial resources and current situation, a county hospital is not very necessary, but a county巡回诊疗所is urgently needed. Because in Haining's five districts (now changed to three districts), except for Xia Shi district, which has many hospitals due to commercial and transportation relations, there is no formal doctor in Xie Qiao district (the fifth district). Therefore, when an epidemic occurs, it suffers the most. (The Zhujiao epidemic in the 19th year was in the area) The following is a list of the income of the county's health funding.

According to the statistics in the above table, from January of the 22nd year to the end of this year, the savings for the county hospital fund will be about 20,000 yuan. It is enough to purchase and open a巡回medical team. (That is, a small-scale hospital is also enough to open) There is still about 5,000 yuan of health surcharges collected every year, and there is no need to worry about regular areas. And the annual advertising donation of 400 to 500 yuan (recently, domestic goods are exempt from donations, so the actual amount may not be collected) can make up for the deficiency. If it can be rectified, Haining County's health undertakings will surely make great progress.

After Finishing Writing

I have written a lot of valuable space in a messy way. Regarding the general situation of medicine and health in Haining County, although it is not very detailed, it can be said that there are already clues. Other things, such as the deep penetration of superstition into the people, have a great impact on the promotion of health undertakings. However, this is a common phenomenon in various counties in the interior, and it is not unique to Haining. It seems that there is no need to describe it in detail. And the proliferation of similar medical industries and the fraud of fake doctors are often heard in the countryside. This is related to the low level of knowledge of farmers and requires the promotion of public education. Other things have been detailed in Shen (Songnian)'s survey report. To avoid redundancy, I will not list them all. (End)

### Common Sense of Hygiene for Diseases of the Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat

— Tang Renjin

(117) Injury to the Eardrum

Injuries to the eardrum can be broadly divided into two types: direct injury and indirect injury. Direct injuries are mostly caused by sharp objects entering from the outside. For example, matchsticks and ear spoons. Sometimes, the eardrum can also be damaged when removing foreign objects from the ear. Indirect injuries are often caused by explosions of ammunition or by striking the ear with the palm of the hand. Fractures of the base of the skull are also often accompanied by eardrum rupture. When the eardrum ruptures, the patient often has a feeling of rupture in the ear. At the same time, there is a severe earache, tinnitus, and difficulty hearing. Bleeding is generally small when the injury is simple and limited to the eardrum. If there is damage to the bone wall or skin, the amount is relatively large. The shape of the rupture often varies depending on the nature of the injury. The following is a special description.

1. Direct injury...Mostly drawn on the lower front or lower rear. The shape and size of the eardrum perforation often correspond to the shape and size of the object causing the injury. The edge of the perforation is often attached with blood clots.

2. Indirect injury...Can often cause forensic problems. Its characteristics can be roughly divided into four points.

(1) Location—Most often in the lower front. About 23%. Second to the lower rear. About 18%.

(2) Shape—Mostly in the shape of a crack. Its direction is often radial. The edge of the crack is finely serrated. However, after a considerable period of time. Its shape. Can often change.

(3) Surrounding eardrum—Near the crack. Blood clots are often attached. and subcutaneous bleeding or small blood spots. Or the entire eardrum is dark red.

(4) Side of the ear affected—Mostly comes from the left side. This is because the right palm is often used to strike the left ear of the opponent.

If this disease is properly treated, it can often be cured quickly. Sometimes it can also cause suppurative otitis media.

(118) Tympanitis

Tympanitis refers to primary inflammation limited to the eardrum. It is different from the general term for otitis media. Clinically, there are two general types. (To be continued)

Supplements to the Shen Bao Local Edition

### The Back Door of the Church

— Luo Yan

We walked through all the streets exposed to the sun, finally arriving at the foot of the cassock-like church. Turning around the circular pavement, we arrived at a wide square dazzling with sunlight. He withdrew his hand, panting and sighing. I looked at the cloth coat on my shoulder, crumpled and soiled by the sweat-soaked hand. Sweat flowed in his sunken temples, and his eyes, grayed by suffering, were empty, devoid of memory, devoid of valor.

“Does it hurt?”

He didn't answer. He tilted his head softly towards the sky. His disfigured hand rested on his abdomen, and he sat down on the edge of the steps, tears streaming down because of the scorching heat of the stone surface.

Could this be him? That man who used to bury his head and run dozens of miles in one breath, a young man who was originally of a generous disposition and skilled at agitation, two days ago, he quenched his thirst with plum juice and dozed off at the foot of the Huítian Building. From there, he became too sick to support himself. The shopkeeper didn't want to keep him; the hotel guests detested him.

"Go to the French church! It's very comfortable there." When he still couldn't stop the diarrhea and pain after eating the mixed stir-fry of alum and eggs, an old worker finally said.

### Honeymoon Trip

— Sai Yu

After their wedding, the first thing they did was to go to Hangzhou for their honeymoon.

Hangzhou is a place of scenic beauty, which has intoxicated the hearts of many people. Moreover, they were newlyweds, and they felt very happy in such an environment.

While sightseeing, she climbed those mountain paths and didn't feel tired at all. She even walked up to "Upper Tianzhu," refusing to be carried in a sedan chair. He was both surprised and delighted. So she said to him: "I used to be very weak due to irregular menstruation, with sore waist and legs, abdominal distension, and headaches. Since I took 'Yuè Yuè Hóng' pills, these symptoms have gradually disappeared, and my body has become healthier day by day." Hearing this, he secretly thanked the spiritual remedy of Wuzhou Pharmaceutical, which allowed him to have a lively and beautiful wife.

### Little Brother's Happiness

— Tian Zhen

One evening, the mother took her little brother, passed by Fourth Road, at the corner of Henan Road, saw a tall building, from the bottom to the top, surrounded by neon lights, red and green, it was really beautiful. The little brother then asked his mother: "Which company is this?" The mother said: "Didn't you see the words on the sign? This is Wuzhou Pharmacy." The little brother said: "I have two friends who eat 'Jialè Calcium' chocolate candies from Wuzhou Pharmacy. They said that this kind of candy is different from ordinary candies, it contains calcium, and eating it can strengthen teeth and bones. Shall we buy some now?" The mother said: "Okay." Then she took her little brother in and bought two packs of "Jialè Calcium." On the way home, the little brother was very happy!

This is the only towering cathedral. Around it, during these hot northern summer days, it is especially quiet. We went around most of it, stopping at the back door in that small alleyway.

There were many bare-shouldered young people here, as well as some indistinct Tianjin local women. Those with white cloths wrapped around their hands were sitting against the wall, placing their large feet in the sunlight in front of them. The women's faces had the greenish color of cantaloupe, and the underdeveloped children clung to their hips.

"Old brother! Is it opening soon?" I asked a middle-aged man with a face full of charcoal dust.

"Sit for a while, it'll be soon." He answered me in a voice containing charcoal dust. There was a sore the size of a teacup on the muscle of his chest.

A sick child cried loudly, then hummed with a weak, trembling voice. The small door finally opened slowly.

The people politely walked into a long room. The walls of the room were covered with portraits, there were no windows, and the air inside was cool. The people quietly hid on the benches by the wall. Two nuns wearing robes moved their large brims back and forth, looking around; from the small door inside, they asked one by one, looking as they asked, sometimes using the pliers in their hands to probe a wound, or holding a cotton swab, quickly doing that sad task.

"Doesn't it hurt! God bless you." They said softly.

Finally, it was this petitioner's turn.

"Doctor! Let me be hospitalized." His cheeks twitched with overexerted muscles. His mouth pleaded movingly.

### This is China!

— Luo Cái Qīng

The 16th and 17th sections of this newspaper's "Sketches of Travel in Europe," "Performing Chinese Etiquette" and "Chinese People Kiss with Their Noses," contain the following records: "Once, in a social setting, after being introduced, I met a certain Mr. German middle school teacher. As usual, everyone exchanged names and shook hands, but after shaking hands, this gentleman just kept smiling at me without saying a word. Half a minute passed, and everyone was still standing. I thought, 'Oh no, he's neither a mute nor an idiot, there must be some secret in between.' I asked him if it was the first time he had seen a Chinese person, so he was so scared that he couldn't speak. He found it strange. He was giving me the most respectful Chinese etiquette... It is said that he saw it in a book, and it is a very important etiquette, only used when meeting officials..." and "...Why do Chinese people kiss with their noses? Is it because they are concerned about hygiene? It seems that a definite answer cannot be obtained in Europe. Even the famous writer Mrs. Buck only has a negative explanation for this question..." Therefore, that reporter said: "Many Chinese etiquettes, we ourselves not only don't know, but even if we tear through ancient books, we can't find any basis for them, but Europeans understand them very clearly."

Is it true that Europeans understand many Chinese etiquettes very clearly?

China, in the eyes of Europeans and Americans, has always been considered "the mysterious country of the East." China is: a country composed of queues, bound feet, robbers, and opium smokers. Those tour groups and inspection groups come to China for a quick look, and then use what they see on the surface to judge what kind of country China is. What I can't forget the most is a Japanese writer's "Travel Notes of Shanghai." He so meticulously described Shanghai and the people of Shanghai (should be said to be the Chinese) as a kind of people that we ourselves would not believe. They are all like blind men touching an elephant, declaring to the nation of God what they see in their eyes: "This is China!"

It's like this in literature, and it's the same in movies. Many anti-China films follow each director's imagination of China and promote to markets all over the world: "This is China!"

Of course, understanding a country is not as easy as understanding a person. Even for Mrs. Buck of "The Good Earth," she can only "have a negative explanation for this question." To overturn people's guesses about our "mysterious country of the East," only we ourselves can use facts to prove what kind of country China is and what kind of people our nation is!

When the director of the anti-Philippine film "Shanghai Express," Feng Shi Denbao, came to Shanghai, he said to Chinese reporters: When I go to a place, the impression of that place is deeply left in my mind. In the photography studio, I reflect the impression left in my mind onto the movie. (The gist is like this) This is naturally his excuse for the responsibility for "Shanghai Express," but we should also understand ourselves more clearly. A partial reflection of China is possible, because part of our impression has been deeply left in people's minds.

Now, we should truthfully tell people "This is China," not just "Chinese people living in Europe often have to spend a lot of time and effort on this 'nose' problem," "answering in a very playful tone: 'Most respected lady, if you don't believe it, I can try it in person.' (Travels in Europe)" can explain "This is China" that is deeply left in their minds.

Kiss.

The nun rolled her blue abyss-like eyes.

"What's wrong?"

"Dysentery." He pointed to his abdomen, torn apart by the smell of sweat.

The nun went inside, then came out, giving him two packets of medicine.

"Doctor! Let me stay, I can't work, I'm sick..."

The nun turned around and looked at him carefully, shaking her large brim as if dissatisfied with those titles, and sighing嬌聲 through her nose. A servant came over and said to him:

"The hospital is full." He made a disappointed and regretful gesture.

The people in the room quietly paid attention to this sick young man, some sighing, the other nun holding the alcohol flame, drawing a compassionate lotus root color on her face.

I explained the sick young man to them in a very clear voice; and asked to keep him in the name of Jesus, even though the yard was a little crowded.

The nun listened, took out a silver coin, and sent it to him; and said something, the servant said it was "Take a car home."

But the young man who had been sick for three days shook his head, opened his dead-like eyes, convulsing desperately under his cheekbones, and couldn't speak! He cried mutely.

I was disturbed by his dying expression. My heart was jumping with confusion. Is that solid and encouraging young man in front?

He knelt down like a cold stone; moreover, he fell to the ground, knocking and knocking. I didn't dare to look at him.

Although this is a child whose mind is confused, our country is humiliated.

The nun kept him; and compassionately and broadly sympathized with the other patients.

I watched my stubborn partner's demon-softened shoulders disappear into the small door.

### Piglets

— Jiāng Yě

When the train arrived at the east station of the tin mine from "Rì Lǐ," it was already afternoon. In addition to the daily necessities, the train also brought dozens of strong young men. The people at the station knew at a glance that they were new piglets bought from that distant motherland.

A large group of red Jilong people, carrying rifles and wooden sticks, walked from the police station at the station onto the station platform. Like herding a flock of docile lambs, they escorted the dozens of yellow people who got off the carriages towards the special inspection office in the mining area.

Although the dozens of strong young men had gone through the hardship of more than ten days at sea, after a night's rest in "Rì Lǐ," each of them had regained their normal spirits. They were walking on the flat asphalt road of this foreign country for the first time, looking at the tropical scenery that was completely different from their motherland, and their spirits felt even clearer. Each of them was secretly thinking: Rì Lǐ Tin Mine is full of gold, as long as they do three to five years of hard labor, they can return home in glory. The idea of making a fortune was stirring in everyone's heart.

It was almost dusk. This group of newly arrived yellow people were escorted from the inspection office to the public works office, and it was not until the lights were already shining in the small market of the mining area that they were free to go to their workers' quarters to rest. At this time, the people in the mine all knew that dozens of new piglets had arrived today, and groups of them walked into the workers' quarters to inquire. Some were asking about the recent situation in their motherland, others wanted to swindle money from the new piglets. In short, everyone in the eyes of those dozens of young people who had just arrived from their motherland were close and loving. Because of emotional connections, each of them followed those fellow villagers to the market to spend their first night.

In the opium dens, taverns, gambling houses, and brothels in the market, all the places of enjoyment, new guests were added. The white Jilong people were all smiling and welcoming these new big customers. The opium dens had the best opium for you to smoke, the taverns had the best dishes for you to eat, you could gamble as you pleased in the gambling houses, and the brothels had white, black, red, and yellow girls to accompany you. All the pleasures were yours to enjoy, although those owners knew that they didn't have a penny, but it didn't matter, you had wages anyway, and the cost of a lifetime of work was in the mine.

This group of newly arrived strong young men were wondering why they could get such happiness without a penny. They were all thinking: No wonder everyone in their hometown said that Rì Lǐ was a happy land full of gold. How could there be a second place in the world where you could enjoy yourself without spending a penny? They were just smiling and thinking, they were just having fun, but they didn't know that they were using their lives as the price of happiness.

The happiness of the first night passed, and early the next morning, they were sent into the underground mine.

A month passed quickly. According to the usual practice of the mine, they should get two full days of rest after working for a month, and it was also time to pay wages. This group of young men who had only worked hard for a month were happy to get their wages and prepared to go to the market to spend the night again. But the wages were distributed, only the smallest part. The people in the mining office said: Part of your wages has been collected by the merchants in the market. After saying that, they gave them a bill. This sudden blow stunned them, but in an instant, those merchants came to greet them to enjoy themselves again. In this way, they would never have extra wages, and they couldn't even think about returning to their motherland. They would be foreign devils' production piglets for the rest of their lives, until they died.

The sky is clear, the wind is breezy, and the air is refreshing, a few lines of new geese fly across the sky. The servants are busy, Gao Lishi is in the Imperial Garden, sweeping and cleaning with great effort. The scenery of the inner garden is endless in autumn, there are remnants of lotus everywhere in the ponds. After a while, they reported that Emperor Ming had arrived, favored concubine Yang supporting him on the left and right. Countless osmanthus flowers are fragrant, and sometimes parrots call to each other. The imperial banquet is set up in the flower pavilion, and the table is full of delicacies from the sea and mountains. The slender jade hands hold the golden pot. The emperor beats the board, the concubine sings, and the magical dance of Ni Chang is known to the world. Taizhen kneels and offers three cups of wine, and the emperor happily takes her hand and helps her up. Concubine Yang is drunk in Concubine Yang's couch, a picture of begonia in spring sleep, the drunken appearance is more charming. Who knows, the joy is not over and the sorrow has arrived, saying that An Lushan's rebellion is rampant, directly forcing the capital, what can be done, the world of the Tang Dynasty has been peaceful for a long time, the civil and military officials have no defense against the enemy. Quickly order the six armies to protect the emperor, hurriedly horses and carriages go on a long journey, temporarily avoid the smoke of war and luckily go to Shu.

Yingying is the head of the fifteen girls, selected into the palace, not counting the autumn. Lonely in the long gate, her shadow hangs, listening to the songs and dances of the South Palace and the sorrows of the North Palace. Where does the flying catkin pity the weak quality, and the prunus mume complains to the heart. She has never seen the king's face, and the sheep cart has never fortunately decorated the building. Things in my heart, tears flow, infinite feelings only want to rest. Leisurely take the needle to pass the long painting, embroidery to the mandarin duck then feel shy. Seeing the maple leaves falling all over the yard, silently pray to the sky to fulfill the wish. Lady Han has been talented since childhood, and wrote poems on red leaves to give to the imperial ditch. A couplet of beautiful sentences goes with the water, the world and the sky are both leisurely. Talented people are always sentimental things, cherish the tear marks and keep them well. Yu Sheng picked it up and retitled it, and the red leaves still went upstream. Until the release of the palace people from Xingqing Palace, ten years of separation began together. At that time, the red leaves were not unintentional, this day's fate is not free, the laborers and housewives chanted Hezhou.

Wang Zhaojun sits bored in the saddle. Thinking of the Han emperor. Morning and evening. Evening and morning. Sadly, the road ahead is茫茫. Staring at the empty sky. Seeing the wild geese falling on the sand, the sound breaks the冲阳. The moon is dim. Reflecting the Yanmen Pass. Outside the Great Wall, wind and frost. Wanting to kill the busy hooves of horses. Thinking all day long. Thinking all night long. The soul dreams of the emperor. The family courtyard of the Han family remembers the sadness. A long hatred for wind and frost in a foreign land, the slave's tears wet the silk skirt. The inn is desolate, the night is not over. The moon shines on the gauze window, breaking the heart. Looking at the emperor's gate, thousands of miles away, the empty imagination. How can the slave not be disappointed. How can the slave not be miserable. From now on, the pipa will be played on horseback, endless. A song of resentment, two lines of tears. The first sing of Yangguan. The past is hard to forget. A stack of pipas. Turning back to look at the rivers and mountains of the homeland, all sad. Remembering the family situation. The kindness of parents is heavy. The love of brothers is long. Away from home. Old dreams, past events. Past events, old dreams, empty sadness. A song of pipa, the hatred is long.

Zhou Xuan plays a nanny, with a youthful demeanor, active on the screen, and her progress in acting is even more obvious and commendable.

Wang Yin is a rough-hewn character, playing a sailor wandering the world. The pairing is appropriate, with tenderness within his strength, and his performance is rare.

Wang Naidong plays a clerk in a foreign firm, with a unique kind of charm. In the play, he is loved by a concubine, and he also pursues the female secretary, using two different tactics, demonstrating his skills to the fullest.
