He was especially admired by all soldiers in the country. In summary, his life's work was for the country, and he should be given a state funeral.

Therefore, I also share this sentiment and requested a public funeral from the government. However, General Zhu's merits to the country are self-evident. The people who serve in the government in our country most need to be single-minded and work hard for national affairs, and not be distracted by personal honor and gain. General Zhu's past spirit of putting public interests before private interests is a model for all soldiers in the country. I deeply believe that young comrades must work together and strive forward.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Empty Words and Facts

— Corner

At the beginning of General Hayashi's acceptance of the great mandate, he issued a policy outline, saying, "In order to realize the stability of East Asia and the common prosperity of all nations, we will carry out a national consensus on diplomatic work, aiming to clarify international relations." Later, in a speech in the Diet, he further clarified this purpose, saying that China and Japan should "join hands to achieve the stability of East Asia..." Even Sugiyama Gen, the Minister of the Army who holds a sword in one hand and a continental policy plan in the other, echoed the sentiment, saying, "The army has no plans to invade China." On the people's side, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an editorial at the time of the cabinet change, urging the future government to pay attention to friendly diplomacy. "Establishing friendly relations with other countries is the universal demand of the Japanese people. Any policy of the government in the field of diplomacy must take the promotion of friendship as its ultimate goal. A cabinet, regardless of its composition, should not change this basic principle policy." Japanese political commentator Takashina Murobuse also said, "Japan should help build a unified Chinese state. Japan's assistance to China and China's acceptance of it must follow the path of a king." Recently, Yoshida Seiji, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned his countrymen, saying, "Japan must eliminate its harsh policy toward China and adopt a practical policy that can be accepted by the Chinese government in terms of morality." All of this is sufficient to show that the Japanese government and public have changed their old faces and have a new understanding and a new understanding of China. At the same time, they are also working hard to correct their past mistakes in order to achieve close cooperation between the two countries. But is that really the case?

If we look at it from a longer perspective, if we understand that the adjustment of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is a slogan that has existed since the September 18th Incident, and if we combine the various realities of the troops stationed in China recently for an overall observation, we can know that the slogan of friendship is one thing, and the invasion of China is another. Although the Japanese diplomatic authorities advocate the unification of diplomacy, and Army Minister Sugiyama Gen also promised to agree with the diplomatic policy, the Japanese army will pay close attention. However, with regard to North China, they still insist that the army must directly negotiate, citing the existence of existing military agreements. The meaning of so-called direct negotiation is very clear. In the future, the northern strategy toward China will of course still only advance and not retreat. The policy of the Japanese garrison in North China aims to complete the "specialization" of North China as its sole goal. If this goal is not achieved in one day, their conspiracy will not be abandoned in one day. Recently, a certain foreigner, under the pseudonym "Da Gongyuan," instructed the traitor Xiao Deping and others to organize a pseudo-communist party organization to disrupt the public order in Tianjin. The intention is nothing more than to create an excuse to put pressure on the Hebei-Chahar Permanent Bureau to achieve the goal of specialization.

Let's talk about economic cooperation between the two countries. According to a recent report by the Allied News Agency, the Japanese Four Ministers' Conference decided on its policy toward China: "Strive to avoid policies that give the Chinese people a sense of oppression, and attempt to clarify the air between the two countries through economic and cultural cooperation between the people of the two countries." Economic cooperation must be carried out on an equal footing and based on the principle of mutual benefit in order to be true friendship. However, the other party will never recognize this principle. The Japanese Shanghai Daily News published an editorial not long ago, bluntly expressing its opposition to this view. The newspaper believes that "those who advocate Sino-Japanese cooperation should understand that the two countries do not stand on an equal footing... Japan's development in politics, economy and other sectors far exceeds that of China. Therefore, it is extremely unwise to advocate equality in future negotiations between the two countries..." This view can represent the views of many people who wear commanding swords and are controlled by commanding swords. If this view is not abandoned, I am afraid that even if goodwill is broadcast every day and economic and cultural envoys are sent every day, the result may still be equal to zero.

### Five Major U.S. Steel Mills Accept Workers' Demands

Implement 40-Hour Work Week and Announce Wage Increase

⊙American Bethlehem Today, five national steel mills have announced wage increases, employing a total of 128,500 workers. If other steel mills follow suit in increasing wages, the number of workers who will benefit will reach 500,000. (1st Day National Telegram)

⊙American Bethlehem The Bethlehem Steel Company announced today an increase in wages of 10% per hour, setting the regular work week at 40 hours, effective March 16. The company employs a total of 65,000 workers, and the wage increase will amount to 20 million yuan per year. (1st Day National Telegram)

⊙Pittsburgh The five largest independent steel mills in the United States, due to the fact that Lewis, the chairman of the Industrial Organization Committee, is currently making every effort to encourage workers in various factories to form a large union, have accepted the demands of thousands of employees to increase wages and reduce working hours today in order to avoid disputes. Currently, the work week is 48 hours, which will now be changed to 40 hours. The daily wage will be at least five U.S. dollars. As a result of increasing the wages of 550,000 people, the annual wage payment will increase to 100 million yuan. The company's decision is in line with the law advocated by Hull-Shirley that all factories accepting government orders should limit the weekly working hours to 40 hours, and can break the deadlock between the Navy Department and various steel mills. Navy shipyards will no longer be short of steel materials. Bethlehem Company, the second largest steel mill in the United States, is also one of the five factories that made concessions today. At the same time, Carnegie Illinois Company, the largest steel mill in the United States, has begun collective bargaining. The principle implemented by American steel mills for 50 years has been broken. Labor leaders are now overjoyed and regard it as the greatest victory for labor in 40 years. (2nd Day Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

(New York) The deadlock between the steel industry and the government has suddenly broken today. Secretary of Labor Perkins hopes that the 40-hour work week system can be established and the steel companies' resistance to Navy Department contracts can be resolved. Phipps, manager of Carnegie Illinois Steel Company, met today with representatives of the Steel Industry Workers Organizing Committee and agreed to hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss the recommendations of the Wage and Hour Adjustment Committee, which proves that the American steel industry has clearly abandoned the 50-hour work week and the policy of not negotiating with outside unions. (1st Day National Telegram)

(Washington) Workers at various steel mills in the United States have made several demands to the factory:

㊀ Increase wages;

㊁ The union can represent workers and sign work agreements with the factory;

㊂ Implement a 40-hour work week;

The authorities of each factory immediately refused to conduct direct negotiations with the workers' representatives in accordance with traditional policies. The workers then proposed to declare a strike on April 1. It is now learned that regarding the increase in wages, the four largest steel mills have agreed to comply after repeated requests from the Steelworkers Union. The proposal to declare a strike on April 1 may be canceled as a result. Regarding the union's ability to represent workers in negotiations, and regarding the implementation of a 40-hour work week, in addition to National Steel Corporation, which has already accepted it, Republic Steel Corporation and Youngstown Steel Corporation have also followed suit. Regarding this dispute, personnel from the Federal Department of Labor believe that a resolution is promising. Therefore, the steel materials required by various factories, which were previously interrupted due to the fact that various steel mills did not implement the "Hull-Shirley Law," are expected to be delivered as usual in accordance with the original contract in the future. According to the Hull-Shirley Law, all factories that accept government orders must implement a 40-hour work week. Most steel mills refused government orders in order to resist this law, so various shipyards are worried about a shortage of steel materials. (1st Day Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

(New York) The strike situation in various parts of the United States has now eased. The Douglas Aircraft Factory in Santa Monica and the Northrup Factory in Walkergen have both resumed work. The United Automobile Workers Union of America announced today that the labor unrest in the Fisher and Chevrolet factories of General Motors in Janesville, Wisconsin, has also been resolved. At the same time, the general manager of Carnegie Illinois Steel Corporation has also expressed his willingness to recognize the Industrial Organization Committee as a representative organization for negotiations.

This message will not propose to re-pass labor laws stipulating minimum wages and maximum working hours.

The President believes that the government should have the power to force both labor and management to recognize the union. (1st Day National Telegram)

### U.S. President Signs Two Laws

Judges Retire When They Are Old, and Will Control Sugar Production

(Washington) Congress recently passed two bills, one stipulating that Supreme Court judges who are 70 years old should retire, but they can still receive full pay, and the second authorizing the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements with various countries before 1940, without the need for Senate approval. This bill was recently signed by President Roosevelt and has become law. (1st Day Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, suggesting that the current sugar production restriction measures be continued, and advocating that a domestic production tax of at least 7.5 cents per pound be levied. Based on this calculation, the government can receive 100 million yuan annually. The President believes that Congress should enact laws to protect small-scale sugar merchants, both new and old, and provide subsidies so that they can share the benefits equally. As for the amount of the quota, the President did not specify it, but said that in order to ensure the expansion of the US sugar input market, the import quota of other countries should not be reduced.

### U.S. Senate Discusses New Neutrality Law

Based on the Pittman Case, Borah Critiques Fiercely

(Washington) The Senate recently discussed the new Neutrality Act proposed by Pittman, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Borah often gave speeches expressing his approval in general, but fiercely criticized a certain clause in the bill, namely, prohibiting American merchant ships from carrying certain goods to belligerent countries. He said that if this layer is clearly written, "the United States will become an ally of a powerful naval country in an intangible way." One of the belligerent countries will inevitably send warships to intercept the other side's merchant ships loading goods in American ports, or even bomb the place of origin of these goods with aircraft. It is not impossible for the United States to resist or listen to what it does, and indirectly support it. For example, if the Soviet Union and Japan declare war one day, the United States may allow Japan to do whatever it wants because the Japanese navy is stronger, and become an ally of Japan in an intangible way, which is actually contrary to neutrality. Finally, Borah also advocated that the United States should have a strong navy to protect foreign trade. (1st Day Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

### Japan-Burma Trade Agreement Established

(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on the 1st that Japan and Burma have signed a trade agreement. The content is as follows: The Japanese representative, Consul-General Shuzawa, and the Burmese representative, Finance Officer Glabley, have been negotiating on trade issues between Japan and Burma since December last year. Recently, the two countries agreed to establish and signed an agreement in New Delhi at 7:30 p.m. on March 1. The Japan-Burma negotiations are related to the Japan-India negotiations. That is, the India-Burma trade agreement conditionally stipulates that when India applies a quota system to Japanese cotton products, Burma should also impose this system on Japanese woven products. Therefore, there are these negotiations between Japan and Burma. Because the Japan-India negotiations are still in progress, the detailed content of the Japan-Burma agreement established this time is not convenient to disclose, but the general content is as follows: That is, Burma allows the maximum quota system that the Indo-Burmese agreement can allow for Japanese cotton products, on the condition that Japan purchases a certain amount of Burmese cotton. The remaining points of this agreement are about the import of Japanese cotton cloth and the export of Burmese cotton. After the consultation with India is over, the full content of this agreement can be announced. (2nd Day Allied Telegram)

### Japanese Navy Minister Announces Policy

Willing to Participate in Disarmament, But Not Willing to Initiate

(Tokyo) At the Budget Fourth Subcommittee meeting today, Navy Minister Yonai answered questions from Tanada, discussing the Navy's insistence on the third supplementary principle, the interrelationship between air power and warships, and at the same time, elucidating the atmosphere of the disarmament agreement and the position of the Japanese Navy. The gist of his argument is recorded on the left: Recently, there have been many advocates of the omnipotence of aviation, and the utility of surface warships has gradually decreased. However, the Navy, based on the current situation and the future, believes that aviation power should be supplemented as a kind of auxiliary force for the fleet according to the current situation, and should strive to enrich it. The General Disarmament Conference of the League of Nations can be held on May 5th and 6th this year. The atmosphere of disarmament of the two countries has now begun. As for the Navy's intention for disarmament, if a third country is invited to conduct disarmament, then our side should gladly respond to the fair and proper disarmament. However, if there is no hope of establishing a disarmament agreement, then Japan will not take the initiative to hold disarmament. (2nd Day Allied Telegram)

### Italian Fascist Party Announces Five National Defense Plans

National Military Conscription of All Able-Bodied Men; Utilizing Science to Resist Aggression; Military Preparations in Response to Britain and France

(Rome) The Fascist Supreme Council held a meeting at ten o'clock last night. Important resolutions were made regarding military affairs and increasing the population's production rate. The meeting adjourned at three o'clock this morning, and will reconvene on Wednesday evening. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)

(Rome) The Fascist Supreme Council today approved the National Defense Committee's recommendations, deciding that all able-bodied men from the ages of eighteen to fifty-five must be national military conscripted, and decided on the following: ㊀ expanding military strength, ㊁ striving for Italian economic independence, ㊂ utilizing science to develop national power, so as not to be invaded by countries with superior resources, ㊃ extending the term of the Government Military Supplies Committee for five years. It is generally believed that this is a direct response to the expansion of armaments by Britain and France. (2nd, National Telegram)

(Rome) The Fascist Supreme Council held a meeting at ten o'clock last night and made decisions on two issues: military preparations and the international situation. Regarding military preparations, after listening to a report by Prime Minister Mussolini, the Supreme Council immediately passed a resolution stating, "Military preparations are satisfactory, but the notion of limiting armaments, even if implemented in the future, is not suitable for consideration. This Council hereby resolves as follows:

㊀ Implement a plan to expand the country's military strength in the future.

㊁ Extend the existing powers of the head of the Ordnance Department for five years.

㊂ All men between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five should be mobilized and trained on a regular basis to achieve full militarization.

㊃ Military needs should be fully met through self-sufficiency, and if necessary, military needs should be prioritized over civilian needs.

㊄ Scientific and technical personnel should work together to ensure the rapid implementation of self-sufficiency. For a poor nation to resist future aggression from countries rich in resources and natural wealth, it cannot succeed without scientific value and a spirit of sacrifice. Regarding the international situation, after listening to a report by Foreign Minister Ciano, the Supreme Council immediately passed a resolution stating, "Declare solidarity with the Nationalist forces in Spain. After General Franco's victory, the disturbances of Bolshevism can be eradicated from a corner of Western Europe." The resolution then enthusiastically praised the achievements of Foreign Minister Ciano and expressed satisfaction with the Mediterranean agreement established between Britain and Italy, stating, "The relations between the two sides have been clarified, which is very beneficial." The substantial results achieved during the talks between the Italian and Turkish diplomatic authorities in Milan should be recorded. Finally, a congratulatory message was sent to General Graziani, Governor of Abyssinia, hoping for his speedy recovery from his injuries. The Supreme Council is scheduled to continue its meeting at ten o'clock tomorrow evening. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)

(Rome) It is expected that the resolution to increase the national army will focus on the navy and air force. The navy and air force were both strengthened last autumn. Air force bases have begun to be built in Sardinia in Africa, Sicily in the Mediterranean, and southern Italy. It is also reported that a naval base will be established on the volcanic island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean for light warships to dock. After these bases are completed, Italy will be able to completely control traffic between Sicily and Africa. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)

(Paris) The Paris newspapers have recently commented on the ongoing meeting of the Italian Fascist Supreme Council, speculating on the direction of Italian policy. Pertinax, a famous reporter for the *Echo de Paris*, declared, "Even with the most optimistic attitude, Italy is at least collecting pretexts against Britain, France, and the United States. However, the excesses of Italian policy can be mitigated by changes in the situation." *Le Jour* stated, "The axis formed by Germany and Italy cannot change certain geographical realities. We have no intention of forcing Italy to hold the Brenner Pass in the north, but if the Italian troops stationed at the Thealps Pass are slightly careless, the consequences will be unimaginable." Madame Tabouis, a famous reporter for *L'œuvre*, is concerned that Italy's current policy "is detrimental to the French territories in North Africa," because the transportation lines connecting these territories to mainland France are already in the hands of Italy and Germany. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)

### Changes in the Italian Cabinet

The Colonial Minister Will Resign

(Rome) General Bono, the former commander-in-chief of the Italian East African Expeditionary Force, was criticized by recent newspaper articles for his ineffective campaign in East Africa, leading to his replacement. He accused Colonial Minister Lessona of ignoring the newspaper criticism. Disagreements arose between the two. General Bono demanded a duel with Lessona, but Prime Minister Mussolini disapproved and decided to organize a court of honor to determine the truth. The court has now declared that even if there are disagreements between General Bono and Lessona, there is no need for a duel. This incident can be considered over. Recently, there have been rumors that there will be changes in the cabinet, and Colonial Minister Lessona may resign and take up an important position in an Italian colony in East Africa. This rumor is related to the disagreement between Bono and Lessona. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)

### Czechoslovakia Willing to Cooperate with Austria-Hungary

Stabilizing the Economy of Central Europe; Speech by the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister

⊙ Prague, Capital of Czechoslovakia: Foreign Minister Krofta gave a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives this morning, stating: ㊀ He is satisfied that the United States has a clearer understanding of its solidarity with democratic countries. ㊁ The countries of the Little Entente are united. ㊂ Czechoslovak foreign policy is still based on the alliance treaty established between France and Czechoslovakia in 1924. ㊃ Britain is concerned about the situation in Central Europe and recognizes the importance of Czechoslovakia. ㊄ The mutual assistance agreement between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, established in 1935, is purely defensive. Rumors of Czechoslovakia's communization are not true. ㊅ The mutual relations between Czechoslovakia and Poland are as before. ㊅ Although German newspapers have fiercely criticized Czechoslovakia, the relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia are generally satisfactory. ㊇ Czechoslovakia is very willing to cooperate with Austria-Hungary to stabilize the economies of Central European countries.

### Britain Unconcerned by Italy's Military Preparations

Believes its Financial Strength is Enough to Prevail; However, Italians Say the Nature is Serious

(Rome) Observers have commented on the military preparation measures passed by the Fascist Supreme Council yesterday, especially the measure that scientific and technical personnel should work together to implement a policy of economic self-sufficiency, believing that the nature of these measures is more serious than any previously taken by Italy. This is the result of anti-armament propaganda in democratic countries' newspapers. For example, the position of head of the Ordnance Department, which was originally established after the Italian-Abyssinian dispute two years ago, has now been extended for five years, indicating that Italy still believes that armed conflict is possible. In addition, the fact that all men between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five should be trained on a regular basis was not even adopted during the Italian-Abyssinian War, further demonstrating the seriousness of the situation. The Supreme Council has confirmed that Italy's current foreign policy is based on an understanding between Italy and Germany, but Italy is still willing to live in peace with other countries and will establish solidarity with the Nationalist government in Spain. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)

(London) After German Ambassador Ribbentrop delivered a speech in Leipzig, and the Italian Fascist Supreme Council made decisions regarding military preparations, British political figures expect Foreign Secretary Eden to deliver an important speech in the House of Commons this afternoon to comment on the matter. Regarding the various decisions made by the Fascist Supreme Council, some say that their nature is extremely serious, but political figures do not believe so, saying that during the previous Italian-Abyssinian War, when relations between Britain and Italy were tense, Italy often took measures of the same nature, so there is no need to overemphasize them. Britain's rearmament plan will not be affected in any way by Italy's military preparation measures, because in terms of economic and financial strength, Britain is undoubtedly far superior to Italy.

### New Italian Ambassador to Spain Presents Credentials to Rebel Leader

⊙ Salamanca: The new Italian Ambassador, Gatta Lubo, paid a visit to General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist government, yesterday to present his credentials. He delivered a speech, stating, "Nationalist Spain is currently fulfilling the glorious task of allowing the country to enjoy peace and occupy its rightful place in the world." Italy is in sympathy with this. General Franco replied that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Fascism have achieved much and are deeply admired. After the ceremony, Franco and Gatta Lubo appeared together on the balcony, and the band immediately played the Italian national anthem and the Spanish "Royal March" (the national anthem of the monarchy, now adopted by the Nationalist forces). The audience cheered enthusiastically. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)

### German Ambassador to Britain Delivers Speech Demanding the Restoration of Colonies

Four-Year Economic Plan Benefits Peace; German Rearmament is Purely Defensive

(Berlin) German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, returned from London and attended the opening ceremony of the Leipzig City Market yesterday, where he delivered a speech addressing the issues of restoring old colonies, the four-year economic plan, rearmament, and anti-communism. He stated, "The world's weaker countries still have the right to acquire colonies, let alone Germany. We will firmly reject any argument that opposes this right. Even the Treaty of Versailles, when the drafters decided to place German colonies under the mandate of various countries, clearly intended to leave this issue for future resolution and did not consider it a final decision. The four-year economic plan can allow Germany to be satisfied in terms of raw materials and is beneficial to peace. "Germany is different from countries that enjoy preferential treatment and cannot develop abroad. It must have a way to remedy this. Moreover, if world trade is to allow Germany to participate in a normal manner, the prerequisite is the implementation of this plan." Ribbentrop then addressed the issue of armaments, stating that he did not believe in the notion of unlimited armaments. "The extent to which each country expands its armaments should be limited by the size of its territory, its financial surplus or deficit, its geographical location, and its sense of security. Germany's rearmament is purely defensive." Finally, he fiercely criticized Bolshevism and stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact established between Germany and Japan on November 26 of last year is an important step for order-loving countries to unite to combat chaos. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)

⊙ Leipzig: At the opening of the Leipzig City Market, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop delivered a speech to the National Socialist Party's Economic Policy Committee, with the German four-year plan and German colonial demands as the theme. He said that the four-year plan proves that German economic leaders have strived to make it possible for Germany's trade in goods with various countries to return to normal. However, Hitler's announcement of the four-year plan was also a last resort, because repeated attempts to sign international commercial agreements had failed. But Germany is not seeking complete self-sufficiency. President Roosevelt's economic policy and the resolutions of the Ottawa Conference both aim at economic self-sufficiency. The German four-year plan reduces Germany's funds for purchasing foreign raw materials, thereby increasing funds for other international trade, which is actually a plan to promote international trade in goods. Regarding the colonial issue, Ribbentrop pointed out that the Treaty of Versailles divided countries into "haves" and "have-nots," creating a sense of unease. Therefore, Germany's old colonies should be returned to eliminate this unease. Germany does not want to adopt an imperialist colonial policy or use colonies to build military bases, and reiterated Hitler's guarantee that Germany does not want to demand the expansion of its navy after the restoration of its colonies.

### Britain's Attitude Towards Germany Has Not Changed

If There is a Concession, Germany Should Make It

(London) After German Ambassador Ribbentrop elaborated on the issue of old colonies in his speech at the Leipzig City Market yesterday, observers here commented that Ribbentrop's actions constitute a polemic and are contrary to diplomatic etiquette. Britain's position on this issue has not changed as a result. For the sake of easing tensions in Europe, if there is a need for concessions, it must come from Germany. The key is not in Britain.

### Monitoring Plan for the Spanish Civil War

Encountering Twists and Turns

(London) The monitoring plan for the non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War, originally scheduled to begin on the 6th of this month, suddenly encountered twists and turns during a meeting of the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee this afternoon. It seems that the monitoring plan will not be implemented as scheduled. During the usual meetings, there are differences of opinion between the countries concerned, totaling two points:

㊀ Chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Lord Plymouth, proposed that if the Nationalist Southern Army of Spain continues to advance northward, then the sea area in southern Spain, which is currently scheduled to be monitored by the navies of Italy and Germany, should be monitored by Britain and France. Representatives from Italy and Germany immediately expressed reservations, saying that according to this proposal, if the Nationalist Southern Army of Spain continues to win victories, then Italy and Germany should be completely excluded and unable to participate in the monitoring plan. In that case, the Nationalist forces in Spain would be blockaded by the navies of Britain and France. Representatives from Italy and Germany could not assume this responsibility and would ask their respective governments for instructions.

㊀ Chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Lord Plymouth, then formally proposed on behalf of the British government that all foreign volunteers currently fighting in Spain should be recalled. Representatives from France, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Belgium all supported this proposal. The Portuguese representative said that the country had already prepared a law to recall Portuguese citizens who were engaged in incitement abroad. Lord Plymouth said that his proposal refers not only to those engaged in political incitement, but to any person who is currently participating in the civil war in Spain. At this point, representatives from Italy and Germany again expressed reservations, saying that the "neutralization" of Spanish bank gold deposited abroad must be resolved first. As a result, the two sides had widely divergent opinions, and the subcommittee is scheduled to meet again on the 5th of this month to discuss the matter. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)

### Romanian Student Atrocities

School Principal Stabbed and Seriously Injured; Government Takes Stern Measures

⊙ Bucharest, Capital of Romania: The Principal of the University of Iasi, Mr. Bratulu, was stabbed multiple times in the head and body and had one ear cut off by three students yesterday. He was seriously injured, and as of the time of the dispatch, his condition was still very serious. After the incident, the police arrested 56 students at the university and searched the student union affiliated with the fascist "Iron Guard." It is reported that Bratulu was originally affiliated with the National Peasants' Party. After this incident, the party may appeal to the "Peasant Defense League" to protect the safety of its members. This group was originally responsible for protecting party members. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)

⊙ Bucharest, Capital of Romania: After the Principal of the University of Iasi, Mr. Bratulu, was suddenly stabbed by three students the day before yesterday, the cabinet held a state council meeting this morning to decide on various important measures to maintain order and avoid similar incidents from happening again, including: ㊀ All universities and student unions nationwide will be temporarily closed. ㊁ Students are prohibited from joining political parties or participating in political demonstrations. Those who violate this will be expelled from school. ㊂ The law prohibiting the wearing of political party uniforms should be strictly enforced. ㊃ All secret societies should be immediately dissolved. ㊄ Negotiations should be conducted with the Greek Orthodox Church elders to prohibit clergymen from participating in politically hostile movements.

### Japanese Hayashi Cabinet Seeks Full-Time Foreign Minister

Obata Firmly Declines; Sato's Voice is Very High

(Tokyo) When Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro first started forming a cabinet, he invited former Ambassador to Germany Obata Nishikichi to be the Foreign Minister, but Obata doubted whether the Hayashi cabinet could thoroughly realize the unification of diplomacy and adopt his diplomatic policy, so he did not accept. Later, Hayashi asked Hirota to invite Obata to join the cabinet, but Obata still declined Hayashi's invitation on the grounds of physical weakness. Finally, Hayashi asked Kodama Hideo to urge him, but Obata finally refused. According to reports this morning, Hayashi does not believe that the invitation of Obata to join the cabinet is hopeless, and still believes that Obata will eventually come forward to take on the difficult task after being urged again. However, when Obata spoke to the press this morning, he expressed surprise at the rumor that his refusal of Hayashi's invitation was merely a "trick," and said that the Foreign Minister issue had absolutely nothing to do with him. This seems to be an expression of Obata's strong determination. In the current environment, Sato Naotake is the most powerful candidate for Foreign Minister. Sato is expected to return to Tokyo tonight, but it is reported that Sato is not only opposed by a certain party, but also has problems within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, it is necessary for the Hayashi cabinet to select a full-time Foreign Minister, so the Foreign Minister issue is unlikely to be delayed for too long. (Central News Agency, 2nd)

⊙ Kobe: Ambassador to France Sato Naotake, accompanied by his wife and daughter, arrived in Kobe at 4:00 PM on the 1st aboard the Yasukuni Maru. Many officials and civilians went to the pier to welcome them to the Toyo Hotel. Regarding the issue of becoming Foreign Minister, he always avoided giving a clear answer and released a statement saying that since this general arrived in Singapore, he had been asked about the issue of becoming Foreign Minister everywhere, and there were even those who predicted that he must have accepted this negotiation and expressed their hopes, which is very regrettable. What can be asserted now is that before he departed from Paris, he only received the news of the establishment of the Hayashi cabinet and had absolutely no news about the negotiation of becoming Foreign Minister. Even if there is this negotiation in the future, he can only answer that it cannot be decided by him alone. The issue of taking office is not a trivial matter. In this difficult situation, it is unclear whether his views will be accepted by the cabinet and whether there is room for his opinions to be adopted in Japan at present. Therefore, even if he receives a negotiation, everything will have to wait until he arrives in Tokyo before he considers it. (2nd, Allied Telegram)

### Spanish Rebel Forces Bomb Capital Fiercely

Government Forces Hold the Advantage

⊙ Madrid: The rebel forces shelled the capital fiercely at midnight, firing ten to twelve shells per minute. Many civilian houses were hit and caught fire, and the sound of fire trucks was deafening. There were also four loud explosions heard on the front line, which were obviously landmines. The command of the Usoala district reported that the government forces were still able to defend their positions. The university district also reported by telephone that the rebel forces were ready and about to attack. (2nd, National Telegram)

### Swatow Traitors Slightly Restrained

Important Traitor Lin Mao-gu Has Also Been Arrested; Several Other Traitors Have Been Executed

Swatow Correspondence: Since the standing bureau has strictly banned gambling, the general gamblers here have all disappeared. However, residents of foreign-owned firms and hotels rely on special forces to openly operate gambling dens. These people usually have close relations with ronin, or serve as special agents sent by a certain party to the inland. They come to Swatow to gather in foreign-owned firms and hotels, indulge in opium and gambling, and stay up all night, disturbing the neighbors. Police Chief Xue Hanguang believed that gambling violated the ban and that traitors dared to openly destroy the ban, relying on foreign power as a talisman. Therefore, he sent detectives to investigate and arrested more than 100 notorious local traitors and gamblers in and around the gambling dens, including the famous smuggler Lin Mao-gu. They were detained at the police station for interrogation, and those with serious circumstances were sent to the Stone Fort Disciplinary Camp for detention, or separately escorted to the 155th Division Headquarters for investigation. When the famous criminals were escorted, they were chained with large iron chains around their necks and their hands and feet were locked with iron fetters, showing a very serious situation. The faces of the criminals were ashen. Among them were Li Weimin, a failed journalist related to smuggling, Li Ruiping, a doctor who often frequented a foreign-owned firm on Shengping Road, and Xiao Guangping, the former secretary of a certain bureau, all of whom were arrested. In addition, there were also some ordinary people whose names were not very well-known. Among the traitors and gamblers arrested, Lin Mao-gu's circumstances were the most serious. Lin had colluded with ronin in smuggling for many years and had a large winery in Tian'gang Township, Chenghai, where he imported alcohol from a certain place and faked local wine. When he was intercepted by the customs last year, Lin fled into a foreign-owned firm, falsely claiming to be a citizen of a certain country. He had profited hundreds of thousands of yuan from smuggling over the years. Lin had cultivated no less than 500 to 600 traitors, who ran rampant on the coasts of Nan'ao, Chenghai, and Raoping, dominating the Fujian-Guangdong border. In addition, several traitors who were arrested, with conclusive evidence of their crimes, were escorted to the administrative office for investigation and handling. It is reported that they have been executed, to the great satisfaction of the people. After this action, those who were usually arrogant and high-spirited have disappeared like birds and beasts, and dare not go to a certain country's agencies or secretly associate with people from a certain country. In addition, the foreign-owned hotels and firms that were previously crowded with people and intoxicated with extravagant pleasures because of gambling are now ghostly and silent, evoking a sense of the vicissitudes of life. When passing by the gate of a foreign-owned firm, everyone's eyes emit a kind of monitoring spirit. A certain consul has repeatedly made unreasonable protests and demands to the authorities, but we have not only refuted them with reason, but also reorganized the people's patriotic array. If a certain party has private goods shipped out or a person secretly approaches a certain party, we know everything clearly. Therefore, the actions of a certain party in Chaoshan are no longer as free as before.

### Japanese Discover World's Top-Ranked Mine in Northern Manchuria

Exceeds Alsace-Lorraine Mine Contested by Germany and France; Development Could Aid Japanese Puppet Industrial and Defense Efforts

Harbin Dispatch: A Japanese mineral surveyor has issued a startling announcement: An unparalleled high-quality ore deposit, truly the world's best, has been discovered in Dagudong, within the puppet province of Sanjiang in northern Manchuria. This deposit surpasses even the Alsace-Lorraine mines, for which Germany and France shed blood and engaged in bitter conflict. Reportedly, the mine is located very near Harbin, approximately twenty kilometers from Sanxing. The mining area is vast, stretching from Dagudong through the southern banks of the Songhua River to the Mudanjiang River basin, forming a broad, extensive, and exceptionally rich mineral deposit. Current investigations, limited to the exposed coal seams, indicate that coal production will be a byproduct, yielding 1 to 1.5 million tons annually. The primary product will be lubricating oil, with an annual output of 3 million tons. The Japanese discoverer, in collaboration with experts from the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), is actively continuing the investigation. Results have confirmed it as the world's largest mine. The Japanese puppet authorities recognize its significant implications for their five-year industrial development plan. Mantetsu and others will initially invest 20,000 yuan to establish a new company. Once the weather warms and the ground thaws, an additional 500,000 yuan will be invested for trial excavations. If development proves successful, the Japanese believe that both Japan and the Northeast will be able to acquire high-quality lubricating oil and coal at extremely low prices. This move is expected to have a tremendous impact on industry and national defense in both Japan and the Northeast.

### Changshu

Man and Woman Attempt Double Suicide in Inn

Nanjing Town, a market town in the South Sandbar area of Changshu County borders Nantong. Though not many merchants reside there, it has developed some form. Yangjia Inn, located in the town, recently had two travelers, a man and woman, check in. Each was about 20 years of age. According to the male's registration, his name was Tang Ninglin, from Shierweigang, and the woman was his relative. It appeared the couple was very loving and affectionate, which led some to believe them as an informal couple. However, the inn was only interested in earning money. However, on the afternoon of the next day, the couple were still in bed, and the waiter found them unconscious with the woman lying in the man's arms. After medical attention, the man regained consciousness, while the woman passed. The man was then identified as Ma Cailin, a local bully from Shierweigang with no formal job. The woman was from northern Jiangsu and was his mistress. The woman's real husband, who is a police officer in Nantong, had found out about his wife's affair and was going to do something about it. As a result, the man and woman brought two yuan worth of raw opium with intentions of committing suicide together. The man was saved but is mentally unstable. The owner of the inn has reported this to the police, who have requested a court order to investigate.

On the afternoon of the 28th, Jiang Futian attempted to enter without purchasing a ticket, leading to a verbal altercation with Liu Quandde. Jiang Futian was subsequently beaten by Xu Yongkang and others. Injured, Jiang Futian returned to his village and gathered over a hundred villagers. Liu Quandde, hearing of this, also gathered two hundred villagers. Both sides armed themselves with knives, clubs, carrying poles, and other weapons, resulting in a prolonged brawl with twenty to thirty injuries on each side.

### Chengdu and Sichuan Politics

— Geng Ya

Since this province abolished the defense zone system, the political situation in Chengdu has gradually stabilized, the population has increased, transportation has developed, and industry and commerce have gradually become active. Undoubtedly, it will now put on a new dress of prosperity. The water of the Yangtze River flows eastward, but the trend of urban prosperity seems to be rising westward step by step. Hankou wants to rival Shanghai, Chongqing wants to emulate Hankou, and Chengdu wants to follow Chongqing. Naturally, seeking the best yields average results, and seeking average yields below-average results. Chengdu is temporarily limited by material and technical conditions, and some things cannot be followed up. Even if the appearance is hard to imitate. Some things can be obtained, such as the surprisingly extravagant renovations of shops, the dazzling neon lights, the radio with the melodious sound of Chinese and Western songs, and even foreign ladies and gentlemen choosing Shu brocade beside the parking lane. The boy scouts standing on the street to direct traffic at dusk give people a certain impression that it looks like a foreign concession of Shanghai and Hankou. Some things cannot be followed up, such as not being able to build asphalt roads, but the "three-in-one" roads have to be smoothed and polished, and pure Western-style shops cannot be built, but the shop facade and windows have to be decorated with cement. Some things are a bit too much, especially in the area of enjoyment of the special classes. For example, on the night when the reporter first arrived in Chengdu, he was taken by the airport car to the "Sullivan," which Chengdu people called the best hotel. Going up a flight of stairs to the third floor, there was a room with size and equipment that could not catch up with a three-yuan room in Shanghai, but it was priced as high as five yuan and five corners, and it was not a Shanghai-style bathroom. But this is still a small room in the hotel. The prices of the rest are set at "seven yuan", "ten yuan" and "dozens of yuan." It is expected that travelers with low living standards in the inland will be surprised. When asked why, they learned that this is a place for special classes to call prostitutes and have other entertainment, that is, the "opening room" paradise that Shanghai people call. Some people even spend a lot of money to buy round-trip tickets for Shanghai-Chengdu aviation, and call famous prostitutes from Shanghai to have fun here, which is even more infuriating. (Mr. Deng Zhigu, director of the Eurasia Aviation Station, is humble to customers and once said "Passengers are either rich or noble." Now that he knows about this, I wonder what he will think? A smile!) Ordinary citizens like to drink tea very much, so there are many tea houses, five steps and a pavilion, ten steps and a building. Some people say: "Chengdu's telephone in the past was not a telephone but a joke." I said: "Chengdu's park is not a park but a tea garden." Indeed, no matter which park, there are rows of specially-made tea chairs, and they are full of leisurely tea customers, like an exhibition of high scholars, which makes people confused. Of course, there are also people who use drinking tea as a temporary exchange for business, but this is just a rare case. The vast majority of people seem to covet the special tea chairs, spend two or three copper coins on tea, and then leisurely lie down to spend half a day or a day, and then reluctantly drive back. The task attached to drinking tea is to listen to storytelling, watch operas, or comment on chess and fight birds. It is said that a goldfinch once won his master a very elegant house. The master regards it as his beloved son and does not sell it even if someone offers 500 yuan. Now it has been raised to twenty-three years old. I don't know how much effort has been spent? If this effort is used in other legitimate businesses, even if it is just beekeeping, rabbit raising, etc., it is estimated that the benefits will be more than what can be won by fighting birds? In addition, Chengdu people's leisure methods include going to taverns (different from restaurants), going to theaters, smoking opium, and planning to build dance halls, which are too numerous to mention. But all this is enough to vividly portray Chengdu, which is located deep in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Although its material construction is far inferior to the cities of Shanghai and Hankou, which it admires in the lower reaches, the happy life of the general rich and idle people is "better than the blue". As for the general working masses, although they were born in the land of abundance, they are clearly the people of hell. Although this is a flower-filled city, if you go to the vicinity of the imperial city in the center of this flower group to see the life of hell, where hunger and cold are intertwined, it will be "revealed on the spot". The reason for such a contradiction is nothing more than "the prime minister's platform is fat and the world is thin," which is "self-evident."

Chengdu is the ancient capital of the Shu Han Dynasty. The walls are high and thick, surrounded by river water, with a circumference of more than 30 miles. It was built by Zhang Yi during the Anshi period. The shape is beautiful and it is a famous city with historical and political significance in the four southern provinces. Now it is governed together with Huayang County. The streets are interconnected. Sitting in a rickshaw and patrolling, you can see that the house number is Chengdu, and in a blink of an eye it is Huayang. Among the merchants in Sichuan, Guizhou and Qian provinces, there is a saying "Chengdu passes Huayang County, - a county passes a county", which means that "county" and "present" are homophones, referring to not mentioning debt. There is also an imperial city inside the outer city, which is now the site of the National Chengdu University. I visited the provincial government authorities and took a brief tour. After passing through one courtyard after another, it just served as a joint office, and I could not help but sigh at the vast area. But according to a director: "The provincial government used to have a larger area, but it was a pity that many of the former provincial chairmen stole and sold it. Stealing and selling public property, it's simply stealing and selling the place where they put their own "chairs". It is really unheard of. In the director's bedroom, you can see books such as "Research on the Sino-Japanese Issue" and "History of Imperialist Aggression of Japan" placed on the bedside. It is said that other civil servants also use such books as the basis for their spare time research. According to Secretary General Mingjie, Sichuan Province is currently in a state of affairs: ㊀ Under the guidance of the central national policy, we will unite to deal with foreign countries; ㊁ Adjust the personnel system of the province and actively train civil servants at all levels, such as opening up county administration, financial statistics, Baojia, and agricultural and industrial technicians. training institute; ㊂ In terms of construction, transportation, water conservancy, and production are all highly valued, and efforts are made to develop all aspects equally. The Sichuan-Guizhou, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Sichuan-Hunan two highways have been opened to traffic. The provincial routes are more than 2,000 kilometers long, and they are still under construction. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has also started construction. Water conservancy has always used old methods and has not paid much attention to it. Now a new water conservancy bureau has been formed, and experts have been specially hired to be responsible. At the same time, local products will be improved and production will be increased. First, self-sufficiency will be sought, and then efforts will be made to transport and sell them outside the province and abroad. Later, a certain authority summed up a few words about how to deal with the national crisis: Externally, we will support the central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and use the entire strength of the country to deal with diplomacy: Internally, all military personnel, students, and people are trained to use the opposite party as the monthly target. When China is forced to the point of no return by a certain country, there is no way out unless it fights it. From this statement, it can be seen that the people of Chengdu opened a magnificent flower of national spirit last autumn, and it was not a fluke.

The chaos in Sichuan in the past lasted for more than twenty years. The beautiful mountains and rivers, abundant products, and good people were used by ignorant warlords, resulting in various evils such as poverty and exhaustion of wealth. Fortunately, Liu Fucheng (Xiang) had the courage to personally come out of Kuimen and seek orders from the central government. He was aware of the greatness of the earth and opened his mind. He returned to Sichuan to form a new provincial government, unify power, and break the defense zone system. From then on, Sichuan's politics gradually became clearer. Recently, the heads of the construction halls have been appointed, and the achievements in construction are increasing day by day. According to the survey, if Sichuan's agriculture can improve seeds and completely eliminate tobacco and flowers, the province will still have surplus grain for 25 million people, but currently it is only enough to use. The Construction Department has now invited the Sichuan Agricultural College and the Central Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute to jointly form the Sichuan Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute to engage in seed improvement work. The results of silkworm raising using new spring seeds are very good. Sichuan people did not originally know how to breed autumn silkworms. Now, seeds have been purchased from Jiangsu for trials, and unexpected results have been obtained. Therefore, it is expected that the future of silk will be very promising. The sugar production is very large, and there are currently four experts researching improvements. The distribution of mining areas is not as much as in Hunan. Foreigners ideally believe that oil reserves must be rich, but in reality they are not. The gold, silver and copper ore layers are very thin, but the production of salt ore and iron ore is very abundant. However, there are not many miners and very few mechanical factories, so raw materials such as copper and iron still need to be sought from outside. The gradient of the rivers in Sichuan Province is very large, and there are 38 places where hydroelectric power plants can be built. However, the power generated must be used in conjunction with factories; otherwise, it seems inappropriate to only supply electric lights. For example, the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, in addition to artificial work dams that irrigate 5 million acres of land, can also generate a huge amount of electricity. It is estimated that it will not be used for what appropriate factory? The use of electricity in the province is limited to telephones and electric lights, and it has not yet been popularized in all counties. However, each county is equipped with a radio. The provincial government departments and security departments have important government orders broadcast by the Chengdu Radio Station, which can be spread to all counties without distance. This is indeed very effective in terms of government efficiency. Sichuan has always been known as a province with many soldiers. Even after reorganization and downsizing, it can still mobilize 50 to 100 regiments once a major national defense event occurs. I heard that the generals and soldiers are very happy to be ordered to do so. In short: Sichuan has abundant resources and its people are available. It is a pity that it is located deep in the interior and far from the sea. In addition, it is close to British territory, and the threat is everywhere. Therefore, it can be developed as a supply base for resources needed to revive the nation, but it cannot be regarded as the last support base for reviving the nation.

### Mayor Wu Gave Farewell Dinner to Yu Hanmou Yesterday Afternoon

Introduced Yu to Leaders from All Sectors in Shanghai, Hoping for Cooperation in Resolving Guangdong's Difficulties

Yu Hanmou, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Guangdong, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is scheduled to return south on the President McKinley liner on the 5th. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet at the International Hotel yesterday at 12:30 PM to bid farewell to Yu and introduce him to leaders from all sectors of Shanghai. Those who attended include Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Lin Kanghou, Liu Hongsheng, Qian Xinzhi, Huang Renzhi, Chen Jian'an, Tang Shoumin, Ye Zhuotang, Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Yunchu, Bei Songsun, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Chengxu, Guo Shun, Rong Zongjing, Xu Xinliu, Xu Jiyun, Yu Hongjun, Pan Gongzhan, Cai Jingjun, Xu Shengchan, Ji Xiadi, Hu Bijiang, Mu Ouchu, Cai Zengji, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Bingwen, Zhu Hanzhang, Wang Zhixin, Feng Youzhen, Ma Yinliang, Zhu Boqi, Hu Zhengzhi, Zhang Jiluan, Pan Gongbi, Yang Guangheng, Hu Pu'an, Dong Xian Guang, Cui Wei Wu, Qin Runqing, Lu Bohong, Lao Jingxiu, Gu Xinyi, Wang Yunwu, and Ye Fuxiao.

Mayor Wu's Address, First Praising Yu

For his efforts last year to promote unity and break the decade-long stalemate in Guangdong at a time when the situation in the two Guangs was extremely tense. He then stated that Guangdong occupies a very important position in the country and is currently striving for construction, but faces many difficulties, such as: ㊀ The transportation problem, the most important of which is how to further improve after the opening of the Yuehan Railway. ㊁ The food problem, with Guangdong importing 70 to 80 million catties of rice annually. The current food shortage is causing panic and urgently needs to be relieved. ㊂ The currency system problem, with Guangdong traditionally using silver coins. Previously, the premium for silver coins against the silver dollar was about 25 to 30 percent. Since Guangdong implemented the legal tender, the premium for silver coin banknotes has only increased, resulting in higher prices. This also urgently needs to be reformed and rectified. ㊃ The commercial problem, with Guangdong being a commercial province, importing 160 million yuan worth of goods annually, half of which are agricultural products. Efforts should be made to stop the leakage of funds. Furthermore, the soil in Guangdong is suitable for growing sugarcane and making sugar. Our country also imports 30 to 40 million yuan worth of foreign sugar annually. If the sugar industry in Guangdong can be developed, it will also be of great benefit to the national economy. All of these issues require assistance from people across the country, especially leaders from all sectors of Shanghai, to the best of their ability.

Director Yu's Address

Next, Director Yu delivered an address. Yu's sincere and earnest attitude was praised by the attendees. Yu said that our country has been invaded and oppressed by imperialists for nearly a century and has suffered greatly. Guangdong was the first to come into contact with foreign countries, and Cantonese people were the most numerous in doing business abroad, so they suffered the most. Therefore, they first advocated revolution and overthrew autocracy. Since the death of President Sun Yat-sen, the revolution of our party suddenly lost its center. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was firm and persevering in leading the revolution, laying a solid foundation for the reward country. After the September 18th Incident, the country's steps became more difficult. I deeply felt that it was impossible to save the country from danger unless the whole country was united in good faith to resist foreign aggression. Therefore, when the two Guangs were brewing an incident last year, I resolutely obeyed the central government and promoted unity. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Guangdong, he encouraged us to build Guangdong into a model province for the whole country. Given the importance of Guangdong's position, we should strive to build it. However, Guangdong is not only Guangdong for the people of Guangdong, but also Guangdong for the whole country. I hope that people across the country will be able to help with the construction of Guangdong. Regarding the current difficulties in Guangdong, Mayor Wu has detailed them. Among them, the currency system and food are the most pressing. I especially hope that leaders from all sectors

In terms of civil affairs, the Baojia has been completed, and after the security regiment has been downsized, it has been strictly trained. The combat power is comparable to that of the regular army, and the banditry in the province has been wiped out.

### Mr. Patrick Departed for Guangzhou Yesterday Afternoon

To Investigate the Market Conditions in Southern China. Scheduled to Return to Shanghai Around the 15th. Denies That This Trip Is Related to Loans.

Mr. Patrick, the special representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department stationed in China, accompanied by his wife, took the British company's "Nardala" ship to Hong Kong and then to Guangzhou at 3:30 PM yesterday to investigate the financial market conditions in southern China. His assistant, Mr. O'Reilly, will remain in Shanghai to continue investigating the work in Shanghai. Before his departure, Mr. Patrick met with a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency on board the ship. According to the conversation, he is only going to Guangzhou this time and does not intend to go to Hainan Island. He plans to visit the provincial chairman and other authorities and leaders from all walks of life in Guangdong, and plans to stay for only five days, starting his return journey on the 10th, and arriving back in Shanghai around the 15th. In the future, he also plans to go to Hangzhou, Hankou, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places, or may have to return to his country in June to report to the government and meet with manufacturers, and then come to China again in September. Rumors outside that Britain is providing loans to China, and that my trip to Guangdong is related to a 20 million construction loan to Guangdong Province, are not accurate at all. I do not know what the basis for such rumors is. It should be known that my mission in China is to investigate the market conditions in China. For example, after British manufacturers receive a notice from a Chinese businessman to purchase goods on credit, they can telegraph to me to inquire about the creditworthiness of this Chinese businessman in order to decide whether to establish a credit relationship. Since my arrival in China, I have never engaged in any loan negotiations with the Chinese authorities. Mr. Patrick also told the reporter that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, will also be going south recently.

### Shanghai Fish Market Submits a Petition to the Ministry of Industry to Dispatch Warships to Protect Fisheries

The Spring Flood Season Is Approaching, and Maritime Safety Is of Utmost Importance. Please Expedite Maritime Protection to Maintain Fisheries and Emphasize Production.

The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry has been open for nine months, and its business is growing daily. Under the guidance and supervision of the government, the market has made unremitting efforts to develop fisheries production and increase fish sales, which has been convenient for both fishermen and fish merchants. It is now heard that the board of directors of the market has submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry, stating that the spring flood season is approaching, and maritime safety is of utmost importance, requesting that the Ministry of Industry quickly find a way to dispatch warships to protect fisheries. The original petition is recorded as follows: (Omitted above) Approved in the Public Letter No. 119 of February 22, 1937, from the Shanghai Fresh Fish Trade Association, stating that the fishermen and merchants have stated to the association that although the maritime protection business has been hosted by the government for a long time, due to the vastness of the ocean,

Pirates Are Rampant

There is often a risk of neglecting one aspect for another. Every fishing season, fishermen and merchants go to sea to buy fish, and the Shanghai port transfers funds, all relying on the maritime patrol ships as temporary floating banks. Fishermen and fish merchants jointly send personnel familiar with the fishing area to supervise the escort ships, shuttle back and forth, and distribute the funds according to the amount. Therefore, they often organize special protection to supplement the government's insufficient strength. In addition to the fishermen and merchants donating funds themselves, they also receive a large amount of subsidies from the Fresh Fish Trade Association, which enables the escort ships to depart on schedule every fishing season, allowing fishing boats to travel the ocean with protection and safe and smooth economic flow. Now, because your association is financially stretched, it has stopped subsidizing. The fishermen and merchants themselves are also unable to bear the burden due to poor business. Moreover, the original intention of the government to establish the Shanghai Fish Market was to

Relieve the Fishing Industry

As a prerequisite, if fishermen and merchants want their business to be stable, expanding the maritime protection business is particularly urgent. According to the business statistics of the Shanghai Fish Market last year, the turnover was no less than ten million yuan, and the commission income was considerable. However, so far, no measures have been taken to seek the welfare of fishermen and merchants. Now that the spring fishing season is approaching, it is time to allocate a part of the income to organize maritime protection, so that fishermen and merchants can be widely blessed. This is what we have been dreaming of, and we hope that the Fish Market authorities can take care of what is urgent for us. In addition to sending a letter directly to request, we also hope that your association will keep in mind the relationship of mutual dependence and send a letter to the board of directors of the Shanghai Fish Market, urging them to organize maritime protection as soon as possible to increase the business reputation of the market and to comply with the government's original purpose of relieving the fishing industry, etc. Upon verification, the matters stated in the association's letter are indeed true. At this moment, the spring fishing season is approaching, and maritime safety is especially important. It has always been known that your department attaches great importance to maritime protection measures. In the past, there was an establishment of a maritime protection office, with dedicated officials in charge, and the fishermen praised it. However, since the establishment of the market, the office has been revoked, and the maritime protection has been suspended in an invisible way. The fishermen have lost their security guarantee and have turned their anger on the market. The market is a business organization. As for

Maritime Safety

The issue belongs to the administrative scope and should not be interfered with excessively. However, considering that the maritime protection business is of great importance, if it is not prepared in time, it will not only damage the government's prestige but also lose the fishermen's faith, and it will also hinder fisheries production and affect the market's business. According to the letter, it is reasonable to submit a request to your association for review and approval, and to quickly consult the Ministry of the Navy to dispatch warships to protect fisheries in due course, so as to maintain fisheries and emphasize production, which is of great benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry, the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Fish Market.

### The Relief Association Sends Letters to All Sectors Seeking Relief for the Bandit Disaster on the Gansu Border

The bandit disaster on the Gansu border is extremely serious. The Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Relief Association has sent letters to all sectors of the city calling for relief. The original letter reads, "We have received a report from Commissioner Du Yannian of the Relief Committee, stating that the Gansu border area has recently been disturbed by remnant bandits, and the disaster is extremely serious. The general disaster victims are displaced, without clothes or food, and look like starving ghosts. What is even more unbearable is that the general disaster victims, and the women who are about to reach adulthood, are mostly naked, or even without shirts and pants. The cruelty of their suffering from cold and starvation is like a hell on earth. Please find a way to provide relief as soon as possible. In addition to publishing a notice to solicit relief, we hereby send a letter to you, hoping that you will have mercy on these survivors and generously provide relief funds to meet their urgent needs. If you are willing to donate clothing, whether new or old, single-layer or quilted jackets and pants, as long as they are enough to cover the body, they are all needed. Please donate and collect them as soon as possible, and hand them over to our association for distribution, so as to benefit the disaster victims in the border area. We are extremely grateful."

### Overseas Chinese Deported Back to China in the First Two Months of This Year

### Peaceful Resolution of Conflict Between British and Italian Sailors

Foreign Secretary Eden Reports in the House of Commons

Reuter, Biddon, 1st - A question regarding the conflict between British and Italian sailors on Rue Chu Pao San in the French Concession of Shanghai was raised in the British House of Commons today. The question was posed by Labour MP Mr. Burke, who inquired of the Foreign Secretary whether he was aware of the attack by Italian sailors on British military personnel and whether he would lodge a protest with the Italian government. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that, as far as he knew, the matter had been peacefully resolved by the officers of both sides. The Italian sailors had visited the British wounded in the hospital, presented gifts, and hosted a banquet on an Italian warship, inviting a portion of the British soldiers aboard for a friendly gathering. Therefore, the question of a protest was no longer relevant.

### Income Tax Office Submits Report Praising Voluntary Tax Payments

Office Space Expanded

Since the implementation of income tax collection on October 1st of last year and January 1st of this year, foreign nationals and businesses, as well as interest on deposits, are subject to income tax collection on par with Chinese citizens. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in contact with various countries regarding this matter, and it is expected to proceed smoothly. The Shanghai Income Tax Office has reported that recently, numerous Chinese employees of foreign firms and Chinese individuals with deposits in foreign banks have voluntarily paid their salary income tax and interest income tax. This spirit truly reflects the patriotism of our citizens, and their understanding of income tax is also becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, it has been decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for commendation to encourage such behavior. Simultaneously, the office space of the Shanghai Income Tax Office in the original Jianghai Customs Building has become insufficient, so an additional room has been rented on the first floor of the Bank of China Building on Jiujiang Road to serve as the accounting department's office. They have already moved in, and the office in the Jianghai Customs Building is now dedicated to handling the submission of tax returns from all sectors.

### Workers at Ruirong Shipyard Resumed Work the Day Before Yesterday

The Workers' Demand to Sign Conditions Has Been Resolved Through Party and Government Mediation

The 500 workers at the British-owned Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu, Shanghai, had engaged in a joint slowdown strike to prompt the factory to acknowledge that they rejected the factory's abolishment of pre-arranged labor-management conditions and cancellation of union operational subsidies, after negotiations repeatedly failed. Party and government officials sent representatives to mediate once, but no results were achieved. However, party and government representatives were deeply concerned that the dispute would escalate, so they persuaded the workers to resume work first, and then wait for mediation on the terms. All the workers agreed to accept this, so they all resumed work on the morning of the day before yesterday, and all departments reported a return to normal. Subsequently, Zhou Xu Xiang, a standing committee member of the Municipal General Labour Union, together with Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau and interpreter Fei Chang Nian, dispatched by the Municipal Party Department and Zhen Yinchu, went to the factory to meet with Assistant Manager Ai Mu and continue mediation. After lengthy consultations, four solutions were determined: (1) The factory acknowledges the subsidy for union operations of fifty yuan per month; (2) If the factory has operating surpluses, at the end of each year, a bonus of seven days' wages per worker will be issued; (3) Wages will be paid for holidays on revolutionary memorial days; (4) The working conditions for shift changes will remain the same. Since other factory rules were generally the same as the original conditions, they were no longer discussed. The workers were satisfied, and the dispute was declared resolved.

### Workers from Three British and American Factories Form a Mental Health Society

Striving to Implement Labor-Management Coordination

According to Da Gong News, there are more than 3,000 male and female workers at the Xianzhong Tobacco Company (i.e., the Third Factory of the British American Tobacco Company) on Huade Road and Daobang Road in Hongkou, Shanghai. The relationship between labor and management is still relatively harmonious, but the lack of a group organization can still cause misunderstandings. Recently, Jiang Zongheng, Ni Abin, Xia Songling, Zhang Fang, Zhou Jun, Dai Beichen, Shen Wenming, Yang Antai, Chen Jintang, Yao Sangen, Yu Yu, Chen Bin, and other union members of the company, in order to eliminate such misunderstandings, connect the feelings of workers, and implement labor-management coordination, specifically discussed with Zhou Xuexiang, a standing committee member of the General Labour Union, and requested party and government agencies to initiate the organization of the Shanghai Jingcheng Mental Health Society. It is reported that the society has obtained a license certificate No. 601 from the Municipal Party Department, and is officially permitted to organize. The current address is No. 4 Houdefang, Daobang Road, Hongkou. The internal facilities include an elementary school for workers' children, a labourer's supplementary class, a martial arts field, a recreation room, a reading room, and a clinic. The atmosphere is quite new, and the factory has deeply understood this. It is said that the number of members joining one after another is extremely enthusiastic.

### Bureau of Weights and Measures Formulates Methods for Using Stamps and Brands

The National Bureau of Weights and Measures, in view of the fact that the techniques for using stamps and brands must be precise and refined, has formulated usage methods and ordered all provinces and cities to comply with them. The usage methods for stamps and brands are recorded below:
A) Stamps
(1) Stamps can be used to stamp the following materials: gold, nickel, aluminum, tin, zinc, lead, copper, various metals, various bamboo and wood materials, and other materials with a hardness less than steel.
(2) Pig iron and cast iron are too hard and should not be stamped with steel stamps. Weighing and measuring instruments made of pig iron or cast iron (such as balance weights) should be handled in accordance with Article 13 of the Revised Rules for the Implementation of the Chinese System of Weights and Measures. For materials that are not easy to stamp, a metal that is easy to stamp should be attached. The aforementioned attached metal must be tightly attached to the main body and not easy to detach.
(3) When stamping, slowly hammer the stamp; do not strike it violently at once.
(4) When stamping, use your left hand to slightly tilt the steel stamp left, right, forward, and backward, while simultaneously hitting it slowly with a hammer in your right hand.
(5) The weight of the hammer used for stamping shall not exceed half a kilogram.
(6) If there is dirt on the stamp head, it should be washed and cleaned before use.
B) Brands
(1) When the brand is placed in the fire, it must not be burned to red; it should only be heated to the point where it can make scorch marks on the material.
(2) When the brand is placed in the fire, direct burning of the brand head should be avoided. The highest point of the fire should be about one Chinese inch away from the brand head at the iron handle.
(3) If the brand accidentally turns red, it must not touch hard materials. It should be reused after the red color fades.
(4) After the brand has been used, it must not be left in the fire.
(5) If there is dirt on the brand head, it should be cleaned before use.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Correction of Excessive Egg Business Tax Collection

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing:
"To the esteemed Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: Regarding the case of the Egg Industry Association's letter on the 27th of this month, stating that the Maocheng Company, a member of our association, reported that the Xiangxingzhuang agency in Yaowan Town reported that the collection of business tax in our area has always been handled in accordance with regulations, but since last year, the local business tax bureau has changed to intercepting collection along the way, collecting five to six cents per large piece, which is like a likin station and is extremely annoying. Negotiations have been ineffective, etc. Based on this, we hereby report to your association, please quickly find a way to stop this situation, etc. brought to the meeting. Accordingly, we find that the business tax bureau of Yaowan Town's practice of collecting taxes along the way and harassing egg merchants is clearly a violation of the Business Tax Law and the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Collection Regulations. Therefore, we hereby request your association to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to stop this practice, which will be greatly appreciated, etc. brought to the meeting. We checked Article 15 of the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations revised for the fourth time in April of the 25th year of the Republic of China, which states, 'The business tax of this province shall be collected quarterly according to the whole year, but for businesses with special circumstances, it may be collected monthly or collected at once according to its business hours.' Also, we checked the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Classification Tax Rate Table, and the egg business tax is collected at five per thousand of the total business income. Therefore, the egg shop's business tax should be paid quarterly according to its total income, and even if it is not the current year's business, it should also be collected at once according to the regulations in the provisos of that article based on its total business income. There is absolutely no reason to set up checkpoints along the way and tax by piece. According to the previous letter, this is essentially a change of likin, the worst of tax policies. We should jointly send a telegram to your ministry for review and approval, and strictly implement corrections in accordance with regulations in order to maintain the tax system and facilitate public convenience. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows in gratitude."

### Municipal Government Sends Special Envoy to Survey Rivers in Pudong

Issue of Rerouting the East and West Zhu Family Ditches

The Municipal Works Bureau plans to dredge the East and West Zhu Family Ditches in the Lixing District of Pudong this past winter, because the two ditches are located in the center of Lixing Town. Previous dredgings had not addressed the sections near Zhong River due to the presence of buildings on both banks. As a result, they have become unusually silted up over time. The Works Bureau has decided to open them to Dutaipu, but the local people have requested that the section near the town not be opened or that it be rerouted to avoid obstructing the town's housing. They also sent a letter to Mayor Wu through the Pudong Fellow-Townsmen Association, stating that dredging the river to facilitate water conservancy is meant to benefit the people. Since the people have made this request, Zhuo, a special envoy, was dispatched yesterday (the 2nd) to conduct an on-site survey, accompanied by Wu Jiangcheng, an engineer from the Labor Service Department, Zhang Bochu, a representative from the Fellow-Townsmen Association, and local people Qu Shaoyi, Tao Ganchen, Tao Qinwen, etc., to survey the East and West Zhu Family Ditches and the proposed rerouting locations. Finally, Zhuo told the Taos and others that the local people must clearly state their opinions, and that the municipal government will make accommodations if it benefits the local area.

(4) Lan Shou read a letter from Dr. John Jacob Posner, a famous American oral surgeon, stating that he will be passing through Shanghai around October of this year and asking whether any local colleagues are interested in organizing a special class to listen to his lectures in a short period of time. Resolution: First, Lan Shou will reply to the letter and discuss everything.
(5) What amendments should be made to the association's membership certificate format? Resolution: Passed and sent to print.

### Nanking Road Residents Concerned About Security

Send Letter to Police Station Urging Speedy Resolution of Bank Robbery and Increased Patrols to Avoid Future Incidents

The First District Branch of the Special First District Citizens' Federation and the Nanking Road Businessmen's Association yesterday, regarding the robbery of a cashier from the Nanking Road Transportation Bank branch on the morning of the day before yesterday, sent a letter to the Old Gate Police Station, stating: "To whom it may concern: It is reported that the Transportation Bank branch in the middle of Nanking Road was suddenly robbed of a large sum of money by bandits at approximately 11:00 AM yesterday morning. Although there was an attempt to arrest the bandits, they were injured, etc. As the area is located in a bustling downtown area, and the robbery occurred in broad daylight, the fact that bandits dared to appear and act with such impunity is completely unreasonable. If the bandits are not strictly apprehended, arrested, and brought to justice, how can commercial stability be maintained? Your police station has an unshirkable responsibility and should immediately issue arrest warrants, solve the case to deter bandits, and increase patrols daily to prevent similar incidents from continuing to occur and to protect merchants and residents. We would be deeply grateful."

### Taxpayers' Association Writes to the Municipal Council

Requesting Collection of Rates Based on Actual Rent. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent two letters to the Municipal Council yesterday:
(1) "To whom it may concern: Wang Dingwei's letter states that his house at 700 Beijing Road has always been a house with three rooms and two wings, rented from the landlord Cao Zhiji for 132 yuan per month for nearly ten years. Since 1934, due to the construction of new-style Western-style houses in the eastern neighborhood and the impact of piling, which affected the construction of the front part of No. 700, he negotiated with Cao Zhiji in the spring of 1935 to modify the front part of the house into three shops and agreed to an additional rent of 68 yuan per month, totaling 200 yuan per month, including water fees. The three shops were all numbered 700. After being closed for a year, he only rented the western shop to someone to open Tongmaoxiang Copper and Tin Shop in mid-February of 1936. Because of the installation of electric lights and a meter, he received a letter from the power company informing him that the house number must be clearly distinguished to avoid errors when copying the electricity bill in the future, and instructed him to send a letter to the rates office to add sub-numbers to the house number. He immediately notified the rates office, but they did not come to copy and register the sub-numbers. Until the end of February, the rates office sent someone to collect rates and suddenly levied a huge amount, estimating the rent at 450 yuan per month. He stated in person that the rent was 200 yuan per month and presented Cao Zhiji's rent receipt as evidence, but there was no response. Until mid-April, they again brought a rate bill estimating the rent at 400 yuan per month to collect rates, and then in mid-June, they changed the estimate to 375 yuan per month. At this time, they suddenly added house numbers 696 and 698. Then they reduced the estimate to 370 yuan per month. This happened intermittently, and he suddenly received a summons from the court, suing the taxpayer to pay the full amount, etc. The rates office is resorting to an ostrich-like tactic and using a diversionary strategy. They ostensibly reduce the estimate of the rent, but secretly use the Yangjingbang Regulations to freely estimate the price and sue in court. Such manipulation chills the hearts of us taxpayers. Therefore, he hereby reports and begs your association to vigorously maintain justice. Such behaviour has been seen frequently recently, making people fear poverty even more than unrest. Since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai has been poor and has not yet recovered. If peace can be maintained, there will be a gradual recovery, which is what those responsible for political matters should do. However, they have forgotten to cultivate the source of taxation and are indulging in gathering and squeezing resources, not even considering that if the source of taxation decreases, where will the tax revenue come from? This is probably not the original intention of those who have been bathed in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence. As for estimating the rent at 450 yuan, then 400 yuan, then 375 yuan, and then 370 yuan, if this is true, it is simply a bargaining business transaction. We believe that a fair agency would not do such a ridiculous thing. In short, collecting general rates based on the actual rent is the safest way and a necessary condition for the rule of law. Your council should correct this."
(2) "To whom it may concern: The Jin Cheng Bank Shanghai General Office's letter states, 'Our General Manager Zhou leased a house at 1171 Yuyuan Road from the Zhenye Real Estate Company last year for 500 yuan per month. All the patrol rates that should be paid should be paid in proportion to the actual monthly rent. However, at that time, the house urgently needed to be connected to water, and the water company would not connect it without proof that the tenant had paid the patrol rates. In order to connect the water quickly, we had no choice but to reluctantly agree to pay according to the Municipal Council's estimate of 500 taels of silver per month. After our General Manager Zhou moved out, the house was leased by Deputy Director Yuan of the Business Department of our General Manager Zhou's office. The monthly rent was still 500 yuan. The rent receipt for September of last year was taken by the Municipal Council for verification. The patrol rates that should be paid should be changed to the actual monthly rent of 500 yuan in accordance with the usual practice of renting houses in Shanghai to avoid differences. However, the Municipal Council has repeatedly ordered us to continue to pay according to its previous estimate of 500 taels of silver per month. If we do not comply, we will not be able to enjoy the rights of public use. Because we are forced by circumstances, we are sending this letter to you to seek justice and negotiate on our behalf. How should this be handled? We beg for a reply.' We find that collecting general rates without calculating the actual rent is, according to history, law, and facts, a gathering behaviour that completely disregards public interests. If this is not corrected, as those who have read Bentham's works know, the people's feelings of forbearance will inevitably be vented. As for the rights of public use, these are agencies maintained by public funds that should be responsible for providing services to the public. If the enjoyment of the rights of public use can be hindered and used as a tool for collecting taxes, then not enjoying the rights of public use, such as digging one's own well, not using tap water, providing one's own lights, not using electricity or natural gas, would mean that one would not have to bear the obligation of paying rates. Conversely, simply revoking the supply of the rights of public use would allow for the arbitrary addition of rates. After reading the legal history of the world, we fear that there is no such bad example. We ask your council to consider this matter carefully and correct this erroneous concept."

### Another Day of Heavy Fog in Shanghai Yesterday

The weather in Shanghai recently has been inconsistent, with frequent shifts between sunny and rainy days, as well as variations in temperature. As a result, many people are suffering from colds and flu. According to Dr. Lu Baoyuan of Pushan Hospital, this is due to the weather. People should be careful about their daily lives and avoid imbalances in temperature. A few days ago, the weather was too cold, which is not suitable for spring. Therefore, today (i.e., yesterday) there was heavy fog all day, and even drizzling rain. The fog was especially heavy in the evening, to the point where one could not see one's fingers extended.

### Judges are Relaxed

A Blessing for Society. Since the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office implemented the private prosecution system, where litigants directly bring private prosecutions to the criminal court, the cases handled by the prosecutor's office are provided by the Third Section of the Shanghai Police Department. On weekdays, the Third Section sends a minimum of twenty cases to the court for investigation each day, involving around fifty people. On Saturdays and Mondays, due to the intervening Sunday, the number of cases increases to forty or fifty, involving over a hundred people. As the police department is only meant to supplement the judiciary and has the authority to exercise judicial police powers when encountering ongoing offenses, the distribution of cases to each prosecutor is often insufficient. However, from the 27th of last month (i.e., Saturday) until yesterday, for four days, the police department did not send a single case, and each prosecutor was sitting idly. Some say that this year is a blessing for the nation and the region, as litigation is rare and the people are peaceful.

### Three People Attempt Suicide by Drowning at the Garden Bridge

Fortunately, All Were Rescued

The Garden Bridge (白渡橋) outside the mouth of the Suzhou Creek has become a frequent location for suicide attempts due to the wide river channel below. However, it's rare for multiple people to seek death at the same bridge on the same day. Unexpectedly, on the day before yesterday afternoon, three individuals, both male and female, attempted to drown themselves in the river from the bridge within a few hours of each other, setting a new record for self-inflicted misfortune. Details of each case are recorded below:

Du Xingui, 34 years old, from Ningbo, used to work as a shop assistant in a pharmacy in his hometown. At the end of last year, due to poor business in the shop, there was a layoff. Du was among those dismissed. After losing his job, he managed to borrow some travel expenses from relatives and friends to seek a living in Shanghai. He stayed at the home of his brother, Du Xinhuai, at 281 Xichang Road, Laoximen. However, after staying in Shanghai for many days, he couldn't find a suitable job, leading him to become disillusioned with life. The day before yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, he attempted to drown himself by jumping into the river with his brother's knowledge. After being rescued by the Water Police, Detective Xu Lenian was dispatched to inform his brother to take him back and console him.

Zhou Sanmei, 33 years old, from Chongming, on the day before yesterday afternoon, had a quarrel with her aunt, Zhou Zhao. Zhao scolded her for being frivolous, associating with men outside, and disregarding her husband's reputation. Sanmei's face turned red and she was speechless. She left home alone, but found herself lost and without a place to go. Eventually, she ended up on the Garden Bridge and attempted to drown herself. Fortunately, she was rescued by Chinese police officers No. 52 and No. 104 from the Water Police and taken back to the police station. After questioning her and learning the details, Detective Wang Haiquan was dispatched to bring her aunt to the station. After some persuasion, she was ordered to take Sanmei back home to comfort her and prevent her from repeating the attempt.

Hu Yongfang, 25 years old, from Ningbo, used to work as a sailor on the Yihe Company's Longhe ship. In November of last year, due to the replacement of the head of the sailors, Hu lost his job along with him. After losing his job, he rented a place at 17 Xinji Pai Road, Hongkou. However, his income was cut off, and he gradually had no means to survive. The day before yesterday at 3:00 PM, he went out to borrow money but was unsuccessful. Extremely upset and disillusioned with life, he attempted to drown himself from the Garden Bridge. He was rescued by Chinese police officer No. 80-1 from the Water Police and taken back to the police station. After questioning him, it was discovered that he had no relatives in Shanghai, which was extremely pitiful. Detective Wang Haiquan was dispatched to send him to the Ningbo Fellow Association for assistance.

### Continued Trial of Sun Shaoqing, Accused of Soliciting Lawsuits and Extorting Money

Investigation of the Sun Wu Case Completed, Sun Shaoqing Absolutely Denies Involvement

Sun Shaoqing, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 28, Huayanli, Zhangjia Garden, Maitehesi Road, was arrested by Chief Chinese Inspector Lu Liankui and Chief Liu Zhaokui of the Public Concession Police for allegedly soliciting lawsuits and defrauding people of money. He was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the case was continued in the First Criminal Court by Judge Qian Hongye. First, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that during the adjournment, the police had conducted a

Detailed Investigation

However, due to time constraints, they could not investigate every case handled by Sun. They only investigated the case of Sun Wu and Wu Dengrong (owner of Ruihui Silk Factory) regarding the division of property. Sun Wu's name was Gui Zhen, and she and Wu Dengrong were siblings. When Wu's father died, there was no inheritance. Later, Wu Dengrong started a business and accumulated considerable wealth. Sun Wu, through an introduction by Yao Yuebo, met Sun Shaoqing, who then filed a civil lawsuit for division of property and a criminal lawsuit for encroachment on her behalf. At that time, they demanded

200,000 Yuan

And Wu Dengrong had agreed to give 120,000 Yuan. However, Wu's son, Wu Shenbo, was unwilling and consulted lawyer Chen Tingrui. After Chen Tingrui consulted with Gu Gongbing, the lawyer representing Sun Wu, they settled for 40,000 Yuan. However, Sun Wu actually only received 12,500 Yuan. Several years later, Sun Wu reported the entire matter to the Hu She (Lake Society), because she was from Huzhou. The Hu She committee sent a letter to Wu Dengrong to investigate the actual amount paid, and Wu

Replied by Letter.

Now, the police have collected the evidence and are prosecuting him for extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Law and for soliciting lawsuits under Article 157 of the same law. Then, Wu Shenbo was brought to the court and questioned about the process. He stated that his aunt, Sun Wu, first hired lawyer Chen Qun to send a letter to his father, and then he hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to handle the matter. Without going to court, they reached a settlement. He paid the 40,000 Yuan to Chen, who transferred it to Gu Gongbing, the lawyer for his aunt. He never

Met Sun Shaoqing.

Sun Shaoqing asked the court to prohibit the public from attending in order to discover the truth. After the audience left, Wu was questioned again. However, Wu's testimony remained the same. Judge Qian then questioned Sun. Sun absolutely denied the matter, saying that he did not know Sun Wu, had never met Wu Shenbo, and had not solicited any cases as described by the police. In Shanghai

There are many people

With the same name as me. How can you determine that the so-called Sun Shaoqing is me? Furthermore, I have always abided by the law for the past thirty years and have never committed any crimes. The court asked if he had any opium addiction. He replied that he had smoked it before but had quit. The court also informed him that he had participated in the Xu case support association. Sun replied that he did not know. Judge Qian verified the testimony and adjourned the case to the afternoon of the ninth of next month for further hearing.

### Naked Body in Sack Awaits Autopsy

Determined to be Male

Recently, Japanese people on the barren land east of Pingliang Road and Ningwu Road planned to build a Dahua Printing Factory there. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Cai Rongqing, a worker from the Jiyun Company, discovered a naked body hidden in a sack about three or four inches underground while digging trenches to drive piles. He reported it to Matsumoto, a Japanese person, who informed the Yangshupu Police Station. Detective Liu Changgen and a Western detective went to investigate and found that the corpse was badly decomposed, and the chest and genitals were also blurred, so it was difficult to distinguish the gender at the time. They also investigated witnesses in the vicinity, but found nothing. They then transported the body to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor dispatched by the First Special District Court, arrived at the office to examine the body and determined that the body belonged to a male. However, the cause of death was unclear. He instructed two medical examiners, Wei and Zhang, to dissect the body for examination. After the autopsy, the body was handed over to the Pushan Mountain Villa for safekeeping.

### Teahouse Tragedy

Thugs Seek Revenge Twice; Shop Owner and Others Injured

Lu Lizhi, a man from Yangzhou in his twenties, lived on the Hujia Muqiao Road in Zhabei and worked as a ticket seller for the British Tramway Company. He was frivolous and rogue-like in nature. At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, he and a colleague named Kaimen Chang (姓名不詳) from tram No. 70 went to Caopeng on Qingyang Branch Road to tease women. This happened to be seen by the woman's uncle, Zhu Aixue, who reprimanded them in anger. Lu, shamed into anger, arranged to meet the uncle at the nearby Ruyi Teahouse at No. 51 to "have a talk." The teahouse owner, Xiong Jiankang (from Siyang, 37 years old), stepped in to dissuade them, and Lu left reluctantly. However, Lu felt he had lost face because of Xiong and plotted revenge. At around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, he suddenly gathered Yang Da Sizi, a strongman, Ding Xiaohai, a gangster, and about 40 others, each wielding iron bars, axes, and other weapons, and went to the Ruyi Teahouse to cause trouble. They first threw firecrackers and then rushed into the teahouse, regardless of the situation, dragging Xiong and the waiter Lu Zibin (from Siyang, 43 years old) out and hacking and beating them with axes and sticks. Xiong and Lu both suffered severe injuries to their shoulders, hands, and chests, bleeding and falling to the ground. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Lu led the crowd to scatter and flee. Xiong's family members were shocked and ran to report to the Linping Road Police Station, which dispatched a large number of police officers to rush to the scene. They arrested the accomplices Qian Fusheng and Hu Baolian (each holding an axe and stick) and the main culprit Ding Xiaohai's father, Ding Dexi, Lu Lizhi's father-in-law, Wu Wenji, and four others, along with the weapons, and took them to the station. The two injured men were taken by car to Peisheng Hospital for treatment, where their injuries were quite serious. At about 1:30 AM, Wu Guibao, a member of Lu's gang, was unwilling to let his comrades be arrested. He gathered more than 20 people again, also wielding axes, sticks, and other weapons, and went to the Ruyi Teahouse, where they beat Xiong Lingdi (from Siyang, 23 years old), the owner's wife, causing her to bleed profusely from her chest and arms. They were then apprehended by the police on duty. All but Wu fled. After questioning the captured perpetrators, the police station, due to the case involving gathering crowds to cause injury and disrupt order, sent them to the General Bureau for interrogation. The main culprits who escaped, Yang Da Sizi, Lu Lizhi, the tram door opener No. 70, and Ding Xiaohai, are currently being closely pursued by the police.

### Liability Determined in the Fishmonger Truck Collision Case

Zhang Genfu Found Guilty of Causing Death by Negligence; Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months Yesterday

On the morning of February 22nd at 9:45 AM, Zhang Genfu, a Ningbo native and driver of truck No. 16924 from the Fuji Transportation Company at No. 49, Jielu Road, was driving back from the fish market with 23 fishmongers on board. When passing near Guangxin Road on Yangshu Creek, traveling from east to west, truck No. 16499 from the Suhengmao Transportation Company, also carrying eight fishmongers, suddenly stopped. Zhang Genfu then tried to pass on the right, and the driver was careless, causing the

Fence Board to Break

Seven fishmongers fell from the truck, and three died from severe injuries: Wu Yongquan and Xu Ayue from Ningbo, and Bian Laoan from Jiangyin. After the Chinese and Western police arrived at the scene, they arrested the two truck drivers, Zhang Genfu and Wu Zhaoyuan, a Nanjing native and driver of the Suhengmao truck, and took them to the Yangshupu Police Station for interrogation and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei held a continued hearing in the 3rd Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution for

Professional Negligence

Under Article 276, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, and stated that the case was also suspected of involving Xiang Shanzhang, a Hua police officer from Anhui in prison guard No. 97, who was getting on truck No. 16499 of Wu Zhaoyuan when it stopped, causing the disaster. He denied it at the previous interrogation. However, the Hua police officer has now disappeared. Two fishmongers, Wang Abing and Shi Acai from Ningbo, who were on Wu Zhaoyuan's truck at the time, testified in court and stated that Chinese police officer No. 97 did run forward and used both hands to hold and block the road, signaling to stop, and then wanted to

Go to the Tilanqiao

Tram Station. At that time, Wu Zhaoyuan raised his hand to signal to Zhang Genfu's truck behind, but Zhang ignored it and continued to drive on the right side of his car, causing the accident. When asked, both defendants insisted on their own versions. Judge Xiao carefully examined the case and determined that Zhang Genfu's truck had the possibility of braking at that time, and he should not have passed on the right, and then driven on the left, causing the tragic accident. He sentenced Zhang Genfu to three years and six months of imprisonment for causing death by negligence in the course of his business as a warning, and Wu Zhaoyuan was found not guilty and released. Zhang's lawyer waived the right to appeal and he was immediately released.

### Ningbo Fellow Association Assists in Expanding the Ningbo Daily

Members Receive a Free Month's Subscription Starting in April

The joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Ningbo Fellow Association of Shanghai decided to assist in the expansion of the Shanghai Ningbo Daily and drafted eight measures to assist. Details have been seen in previous reports. It is now reported that this year is the election year for the Association, and it has been decided to hold the annual meeting on the 28th of this month, and the election of new executive supervisors, foundation committee members will be announced on April 1. Work has been very intense in recent days.

Because the Association has more than 100,000 new and old members, printing the header will take time, and the newspaper is currently printed on a flatbed press. Printing more than 100,000 copies daily requires switching to a rotary press. However, the installation of a new machine is not timely. After a detailed plan was determined, it was decided to reschedule the annual meeting to April 1, when the new executive supervisors and foundation committee members will be elected. The details will be announced to the various fellow associations in advance. It is also heard that the newspaper plans to hire several internal and external reporters (who must be from Ningbo) and apprentice newspaper deliverers.

### Made Red Pills to Deceive, Kept Radio Loud All Day Long

Li Zhibao and others interrogated yesterday, sentencing expected tomorrow morning

Xu Zhiqing, a Chinese detective chief of the New Gate Police Station, Wu Changkai, a detective, Yin Zhanxiang, and others, learned that in the attic of No. 73, Lane 432, Maybelle Road, someone had privately set up a red pill operation, secretly manufacturing and selling drugs. They requested a search warrant from the First Special Court and secretly went to the address at 4:15 PM the day before yesterday, arresting Jiangbei native Li Zhibin and Shaoxing woman Chen Huangshi. They confiscated forty-one packages of red pills, loose

six pounds of red pills,

six pounds of raw materials for red pills, one and a half packs of white powder, one charcoal brazier, one stone mortar, one red pill mold, and two sieves. All were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhishan, prosecuted according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Drug Prohibition and stated the case. He said that when the police went to arrest them, they saw the two defendants were manufacturing and kneading red pills. The defendants knew that the sound of manufacturing red pills was quite loud, and they were afraid that the roommates would

discover their secret.

Therefore, a radio was placed in the room and kept on loudly all day to deceive others. They should be punished according to the law. When questioned, the defendant Li Zhibao confessed that he was a back rubber in a bathhouse. He met Wu A because he came to bathe. One day, Wu accompanied him to the Great New Company. Wu asked him to make red pills and took out eighty yuan as a start-up fee. Then Li contributed twenty yuan to buy equipment and rent a house to manufacture them. In the past two months, he had made them twice. Li earned a profit of

one-third,

and Wu paid him a monthly salary of thirty yuan. Chen Huangshi used to be a tea server in the Great New Company and had an affair with Li not long ago, etc. When questioned, Chen Huangshi gave evasive answers, denying helping to manufacture drugs. According to witness Yang Fuchang, "I am the second landlord of No. 73, Lane 432, Maybelle Road. In November last year, the two defendants, claiming to be a couple, came to rent the attic upstairs,

stating the rent

was seven yuan per month. Since the defendants moved in, they have always kept the door closed and entered and exited from the back door, so I did not know that they were manufacturing red pills, etc." Judge Chuan Lin believed that manufacturing drugs should be punished with the death penalty according to regulations, so he appointed a lawyer to defend the defendants. After the court debate on the case concluded, the sentencing was set for the morning of the 4th of this month, and the defendants were returned to custody separately.

Couple Knowledge

### Post-Marital Weakness Cannot Be Ignored

...The causes of physical decline after marriage and effective remedies for the harms incurred.

...Excessive indulgence can damage the gonads, causing metabolic function to slow down.

...Effective treatments for kidney deficiency, infertility, developmental deficiencies, neurasthenia, etc.

Marriage is an inevitable matter in the minds of most people, so health after marriage is really worth discussing and studying.

Generally, it is said that the main condition for harmony between husband and wife is will and physique. The so-called will is a quality endowed by physique. To put it bluntly, those with a strong physique have a pure will. Those with a weak physique have a weak will. The so-called determination is completely controlled by physique, so physique is an important foundation for harmony between husband and wife.

If one is weak and sickly, or has kidney deficiency and infertility, it often becomes a fuse for rifts between husband and wife, and it is difficult for the family to be complete, and happiness is, of course, hopeless.

Those who have always been physically weak, or who have committed self-flagellation and nocturnal emission, will find that the degree of post-marital weakness becomes more profound. There are also those who were extremely healthy before marriage, but after entering married life, their bodies suddenly became thin, and at the same time, their vitality declined, and the functions of human beings became weaker and weaker, even completely lost! Marriage is originally a pursuit of happiness. If, after marriage, not only is what was expected not realized, but it is harmful to the body, what misfortune is this! We will now investigate these reasons in detail, and we can draw the following conclusions: Those who are weak after marriage, apart from the problem of incorrect physical compatibility, are mostly due to sexual indulgence. Because marriage is the beginning of the realization of human function, if it is excessively indulged and not restrained, then unknowingly, the precious body is injured, resulting in a sickly appearance. As a result, men are prone to kidney deficiency and impotence, developmental deficiencies, seminal thinness, and weak minds. Women are prone to menstrual irregularities, breast pain, and loss of health. If the body is excessively weak, vaginal discharge cannot be avoided, and the hope of pregnancy is extremely difficult to realize.

In short, to eliminate this obstacle, whether before or after marriage, the method of cultivating and nourishing the youth glands (i.e., gonads) can be used to eradicate it. It is best to take "Hiratol Tonic Pills" to treat spermatorrhea as soon as it is discovered before marriage, and then the symptoms of weakness after marriage can be avoided. Long-term spermatorrhea can cause everything to fall into a state of decline. This is said before the symptoms of spermatorrhea have caused harm. If the symptoms worsen and cause neurasthenia, developmental deficiencies, kidney deficiency and impotence, premature aging, etc., "Germinon," a preparation of gonadal hormones, should be taken to turn the weakened gonads from weak to strong, and all functions will be restored. As for women's menstrual irregularities, infertility after marriage, and breast health loss, "Germinon" for women should be taken to treat them. If there is leucorrhea, "Leukorrhea Cure" can be used externally to make the woman's vaginal tract clean, and leucorrhea will be cured immediately, so that healthy children can be produced, which can be expected.

Health Secrets

### The Latest Method for Treating Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission

...According to research by famous scholars, most children have a tendency to masturbate.

...To correct masturbation, one must have a pure heart and few desires, and improve one's will in order to quit.

The so-called evil habit of masturbation in youth is a vile act that completely violates physiology. Regarding its harms, we do not need to explain in detail. Just look at the meaning of the two words "masturbation" and you will suddenly understand.

However, no matter how hard doctors and brothers try to persuade young people not to commit this act of masturbation, almost all adolescent men and women indulge in it abnormally. This is really a terrible phenomenon, so here we will first record its origin, describe its poison, and reveal how to prevent and correct it, and dare to bother those who know about it to add an examination.

According to research by many scholars, it has been proven that more than 70% of children have a tendency to masturbate. It first starts at the age of eight to ten, but in this period, the proportion is still quite small, and it gradually increases from the age of eleven. At the age of fifteen or sixteen, the proportion is the highest. Masturbation in childhood can hinder development, and neurasthenia is extremely severe. Moreover, the whole person falls into the terror of frequent nocturnal emission, so his future happiness is completely buried at this time.

Sexual disease experts, American medical doctor Newell Wilder, German famous doctor Mano Tor, British physiologist Bolton, and others have proven that 80% of those who suffer from kidney deficiency and impotence and infertility after marriage are caused by masturbation and nocturnal emission. Therefore, the most important gonads in the human body are weakened and unhealthy, and as a result, there is no hope of health. Therefore, the method of treatment should be to take "Hymitol Tonic Pills" to stop nocturnal emission, and at the same time, stock gonadal hormone preparation "Germinon" to restrain all the harms caused by nocturnal emission. And it is necessary to resolutely quit masturbation. Regarding the correction method of masturbation, the most important thing is to have a clear heart and few desires, improve one's will, and avoid bad contacts. All of these should be followed by those who masturbate.

### The Road to Success in Female Breast Beauty

...Wrinkles on the face are just as annoying, all of which are due to premature aging of the gonads.

...If women only seek delicate appearance, it is useless, they must have towering and plump breasts.

If a woman cannot obtain good development during maturity, then the breasts must be atrophied and cannot be towering, and at the same time, the curve of the buttocks cannot be revealed. Such a person is, of course, not beautiful and healthy. The same tragic and troubled as women who cannot give birth.

In addition, what makes women most suffocated and miserable is that their faces are old and full of wrinkles. The former completely affects health and beauty, and the latter is a catastrophe on the face.

General women, they are already aware now, they know that it is useless to only seek a delicate appearance. Therefore, it is necessary to seek the beauty of the body, and it is considered perfect to have plump buttocks and reveal curves!

Regarding the occurrence of shriveled breasts and wrinkles in women, Dr. Venice, a famous French beauty expert, confirmed that this is entirely due to premature aging of the youth glands (i.e., gonads). Therefore, it affects the digestive organs and metabolic capacity. If you can take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinon" for women, you can make the shriveled breasts suddenly towering, the menstruation is adjusted, and everything can be kept young forever. Middle-aged women who take it can also eliminate wrinkles on the face. "Germinon" for women is indeed of aesthetic value.

### The Most Advanced Gonorrhea Self-Therapy

Gonorrhea is the most stubborn and difficult-to-treat infectious disease among venereal diseases, which no one can deny. Therefore, thousands of hundreds of gonorrhea drugs have been introduced to the world, but the gonococcus cannot be completely eliminated. However, some of them missed the opportunity for treatment and became deteriorated. Some of them formed an incurable state due to improper care. In addition to this, most of them were misled by medicine. Because if gonorrhea can be treated through proper channels during the acute phase, without delaying the time, according to the treatment procedure of Dr. Hotson, a famous German gonorrhea expert, taking "Antilin," a preparation made of yellow pigment and vaccine, can be quickly cured. According to the doctor's confirmation, in the clinical experimental records, of every two thousand gonorrhea patients who were completely treated with "Antilin," as many as 1,800 people were cured, and the percentage of patients whose condition was reduced accounted for about 20%. Because the drug contains a large number of bacterial vaccines that resist gonococcus and has the power to penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, it can wipe out the gonococcus gathered in the back section of the urinary system, eliminate the risk of complication, and all gonorrheal orchitis, cystitis, prostatitis, etc., will be cured immediately after taking this medicine.

### Female Physiognomist Accused of Abetting Theft

The case is complicated and still needs to be investigated in detail

Zhao Juexian, a female physiognomist from Anhui, is thirty-four years old this year. She is currently running a business in Room 310, 3rd Floor, Oriental Hotel, Xizang Road, Public Concession. At 7 PM the day before yesterday, she was arrested by the French police for a case of abetting theft. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated her. The lawyer of the Police Department stated the case, saying that the investigation had not been completed and requested that the defendant be detained temporarily, and the investigation should be carried out later. Then, the investigating officer reported that on September 1 last year, Wu Duanshi reported to the Central Police Station that her adopted daughter, Wu Dezhen, stole four gold bead buckles, a handbag, and five yuan in cash and escaped. She requested investigation and arrest. Now, it was found that the defendant was suspected of abetting theft, so she was arrested and requested to be postponed for investigation, etc. When questioned, the defendant Zhao Juexian confessed that she had known Wu Duanshi before. Last year, on Malan Road, she met Wu Dezhen and asked her. According to her, she was abused and beaten by her master, so she went out and got lost. At that time, she took her back and planned to send her back to Wu Duanshi's house. Unexpectedly, Wu Duanshi had already moved and did not know her address. Later, because Wu Dezhen was from Sichuan, she had a female friend from Sichuan, Miss Wang (living in Room 114, Central Hotel). She planned to find a way to take Dezhen back to her hometown. The reason for this incident was that recently a detective named Shen Jinsheng from the Central Police Station came to the defendant's place and caught sight of the girl. At that time, he said that the girl was abducted by the defendant and demanded 200 yuan from the defendant, but he failed, so he informed on the defendant for abetting theft, reported to the French police, and arrested her. She did not abet theft. The court verified the confession and approved the postponement of the investigation for further interrogation. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Shanghai Grand Theatre to Repair Damaged Items

The Italian authorities are still investigating

According to the Central News Agency, although we have contacted the Italian authorities about the Shanghai Grand Theatre being vandalized, there has been no concrete solution yet. It is heard that the Italian authorities are still investigating the case and will then review and instruct on the handling method. In order to resume business as soon as possible, the Shanghai Grand Theatre will start repairing the damaged parts tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but because the damage is relatively large, the repair project will take some time, probably by the end of this month or the beginning of next month before it can be opened.

Domestic Goods Special Edition

### Contribution Talk Strategy China National Goods United Sales Company

— Yang An

The China National Goods United Sales Company has been established for some time. At present, the biggest task in preparation is to raise shares. However, the most urgent work includes three aspects:

First, what is the content of the national goods companies that have been established in various places? What is the business like? What kind of goods are selling well? What kind of goods are selling slowly? What are the feelings of the local people about them? What should be improved in the future? Secondly, what is the status of production and sales of national goods in various places? Is it possible to establish a national goods company? How is the local cooperative being run? Can it be contacted? All of these are points that should be paid attention to in the preparation work.

The second is design. Based on the findings of the survey, we will begin to determine which places should be established first, which places should be established next, how the business should be run, how much capital is needed, where the location should be, how to start the preparation, how to contact the local people, and how to cooperate effectively with the financial community. This is the initial stage of design.

The third is promotion. The area of national goods will become wider and wider in the future. Promotion work is indispensable. Special personnel should be assigned to make contact and go to various places to make practical connections. Or use newspaper publicity, or take lectures, or seminars, so that the joint venture of national goods can go deep into the interior, become a household name, and reach no distance, so as to truly realize the function of the liaison organization.

### Regarding Hopes for the "Civil Servant National Products Year"

— Xuan Wan

Many groups dedicated to promoting national products have already designated this year as the "Civil Servant National Products Year," and are actively preparing to unveil its commencement. Everyone's attention will naturally be focused on this year with its promising future, filled with renewed hopes for progress.

At this time, I personally deeply feel that "empty words are useless, practice is paramount," which is a clear lesson from history and also the guideline for us to engage in developing national products in the future. Therefore, here, I write down three of the most basic and heartfelt hopes that can be implemented and achieved within this year.

First, I hope that all national civil servants, who are the center of this year's national products movement, should unitedly and dutifully take the lead, setting an example for the nation's populace to strive to use national products. In particular, within this year, they should (A) correct and eliminate the remaining foreign goods worship mentality of a small number of people in the country, and (B) promote various national products campaigns in society.

Second, I hope that the industrial circles of the country can still, this year, uphold the spirit of burying themselves in hard work, and the established policy, actively proceed to strive to expand overseas markets, so that foreign trade has a better trend, and establish and expand the National Products United Operations Company, laying the most solid and unshakable foundation for the production and sales of national products.

Third, I hope that people from all walks of life across the country can, starting this year, have a deeper understanding and recognition of the seriousness of our current economic national crisis, and that promoting national products is a matter of the survival of our entire nation. Everyone should unite and follow the national civil servants, and strive for the national products movement.

### An Investigation of National Cement Production

— Bao

I recently saw an article in the newspaper entitled "How to Consolidate the Economic Foundation," and deeply admired its profound insights. However, the statement that "recently, cement has been in slight demand due to construction projects, and we cannot but seek it from Japanese goods" does not accord with the facts. According to the state of production and sales of cement in our country, the supply currently exceeds the demand. I will now list the domestic cement production as follows:

Judging from the cement production, it is indeed surplus, and there is no need to rely on imported cement. In terms of price, the recent Shanghai Municipal Council's bidding for cement showed that the bid price for foreign cement, bagged, was seven yuan and thirty-four cents per barrel, while the bid price for domestic cement, bagged, was six yuan and fourteen cents per barrel. Foreign goods cannot compete with domestic goods. However, the market prices of all materials continue to rise, which will affect the manufacturing costs of domestic cement.

The demand for cement will not increase significantly before October of this year. Both the Qixin and China Cement factories have automatically reduced their production. After October, the demand will increase slightly. Although the Guangdong situation has been settled and excessive taxes have been abolished, the transportation of goods to Guangdong is congested, and there is a lack of ships, which has slightly delayed the shipment of goods from the Qixin factory from Tanggu to Shanghai. In addition, due to the urgent diplomatic situation, the railway bureau has not been able to fully supply vehicles for the transportation of goods, so the freight transportation of the Longtan China Cement factory has also been slightly hindered. However, through the efforts of the factories, the situation has long been restored to its original state, and the supply of goods is normal. Therefore, there is no shortage of domestic cement at present. I am afraid that the outside world will misunderstand, so I will not hesitate to use my words to express it, and offer it as an aid to the investigation of domestic commercial affairs.

### Impressions of the National Manufactured Goods Exhibition

— Zhang Baling

The "National Manufactured Goods Exhibition" organized by the Jianghai Customs has opened on January 24th. In this country with a backward industry, where the manufacturing industry is abnormally pitiable, and where the import of foreign goods still occupies a considerable share, the Jianghai Customs is able to collect the manufactured products of various national goods factories for a large-scale exhibition, giving the general public an opportunity to recognize the degree of progress of our national manufactured goods, and thereby arouse their determination to use national goods, which is not without value and significance.

The exhibition hall is located on the third floor of the Jianghai Customs, and the space is quite large. The author took the time to visit it the day before yesterday morning, and the impressions were very good. Here is a summary of the impressions:

In addition to this, the yarn samples and patterns of the Xin Shen Yarn Factory are also very lovely; the various wire nails of the Gongqin Iron Factory, arranged into a beautiful landscape painting, are even more commendable.

Various other porcelain products, glass products, hemp products, silk fabrics, rubber products, knitwear, woolen fabrics, chemical drugs, canned products, cosmetics, ornaments, various machines, etc., are displayed in a colorful manner, giving the audience a good impression that our Chinese manufactured goods have made considerable progress through the efforts of the production industry.

On the way home, the author silently thought: This National Manufactured Goods Exhibition organized by the Jianghai Customs is of great significance. It is hoped that since this public exhibition, it will promote the recognition of national goods by the general public, and further increase their interest in promoting and using them.

The types of national manufactured goods solicited by the Jianghai Customs this time are numerous, no less than six or seven thousand kinds, and there are also more than 700 national goods factories participating, which is indeed a large-scale exhibition. The most notable items on display are the various electrical appliances of the Construction Committee, such as electric stoves, electric fans, generators, etc., the styles are very beautiful, and on each item, there is a description explaining the source of the raw materials, the method of use, and the selling price, so that visitors can invisibly increase some electrical knowledge. The second most notable items are various toys, such as birds and animals, airplanes, gas masks, tanks, cars, etc., the structure is also very sophisticated, and compared with imported goods, it is even better. These toys are mostly produced by the Kangyuan factory, which is enough to improve children's knowledge, enlighten children's thoughts, and increase children's interest in studying national defense issues, which is also very meaningful.

In addition to this, the yarn samples and patterns of the Xin Shen Yarn Factory are also very lovely; the various wire nails of the Gongqin Iron Factory, arranged into a beautiful landscape painting, are even more commendable.

### A Brief Discussion on Sales (3)

— Ding Kai

Here, let me introduce some anecdotes of success due to the psychology of association.

The sales manager of Ford Motor Company in the United States has a special understanding of identifying customer credit. He has been in office for more than ten years. Most of his daily work is spent meeting buyers or visiting customers. He is not only fully responsible for bookkeeping or cash sales in transactions, but also makes decisive decisions at any time. On the one hand, he relies on the investigation of customer credit, and on the other hand, he distinguishes the creditworthiness of the buyer from the moment he shakes hands with the guest. He also makes a very interesting record of "large and hard" "small and hard" "large and soft" palms. It is said that this kind of discrimination is scientific and not very wrong, because it has been obtained from more than ten years of experience and the handshake experience of tens of thousands of people.

There is a Matsushita grocery and food store in Japan. The female store owner, "Miyochi," has always been known for her ability. She always treats the many housewives who enter the store every morning with kindness, or helps the store clerks to greet them. She often says to the store clerks, "If the housewife who comes today has suddenly dressed somewhat stimulatingly, and her hair is tied up as if only half-done, and when she enters the door, she is in such a hurry, and although her face has not been powdered, she shows a happy smile, we should advise her to buy more fish, meat, and vegetables, or a chicken, because experience tells us that this housewife has a distinguished guest at home."

The Rowntree Company in the UK is a well-known giant in the European confectionery industry. Before the launch of its "Black Magic Chocolate," the company decided to conduct a market analysis. They widely tested various tastes among the general public, and also solicited opinions from the public on the color matching of the packaging. As a result, the Black Magic Chocolate achieved amazing success in its launch.

### A Description of Ms. Xu Quhong's Fundamental Methods for Promoting National Products (Continued from Issue 201)

— Ms. Lin Wen

㊃ I hope to establish a National Products Consulting Center jointly with merchants and factories. The center should have a consulting department (including both written and face-to-face inquiries), a design department, a mail order department, and a telephone purchasing department. The consulting department will be used for general inquiries from those who do not know how to identify the authenticity of national products through written or face-to-face inquiries. The design department will be responsible for designing on behalf of others. For example, if women in various provinces and cities order national products clothing, as long as they specify the size and indicate the amount of money they plan to spend, the department will design, select materials, and manufacture them within a limited time and send them by mail. In this way, national products can be actively promoted and convenience can be provided to people, which may be a shortcut to promote national products. The mail order department is in charge of mailing, but the selection of goods must be based on caution to show credibility. The telephone purchasing department should prioritize the delivery of goods with agility. (Note: The Sanyou Industrial Society has already implemented this.)

㊄ I hope that the Chinese National Products Company will find a way to issue a kind of competitive purchasing award certificate (this certificate can be printed with some simple aphorisms to awaken the public), and send it to each family during the visit. This kind of award certificate can be brought to the company for registration each time you shop. Check once every quarter or year, and the one who buys the most goods (can be divided into first, second, third place...) can be given a commemorative award. This method is more valuable than giving out various theater vouchers. The Tianjin National Products Sales Office has used this method to great effect, and Shanghai can explore this method to promote it!

㊅ I hope that various national goods manufacturers will find ways to cultivate specialized talents. For example, the current domestic pigments have not yet produced excellent and applicable products, so that no matter what kind of cloth, the pigments that do not fade must be supplied from foreign countries. Various manufacturers should find ways to plug this large leakage, and cultivate this kind of talent. Each manufacturer should take a percentage of the annual surplus as a subsidy, so that other students who return to China after studying will make the greatest contribution and serve the factory.

㊅ It is best if the National Products Company can set up small-scale branch companies on various roads. Shanghai is so big that people cannot be required to run to the Mainland Commercial Field to buy everything. Set up these small shops to facilitate the purchase of nearby customers. Prepare more daily necessities to absorb the purchasing power of ordinary people, and cultivate their habit of loving national products. Otherwise, people who are generally provincial will inevitably neglect small things and buy cheap foreign goods at will.

Ms. Xu is a woman with rich experience and forward-looking thinking. She has always been happy to use national products. When she was in Tianjin, she encountered many difficulties in using national products and the ridicule of her relatives and friends, but she decided to adhere to the thorough spirit of attitude for decades! Women compatriots, you must know that women cannot serve on the battlefield, your greatest responsibility is: to educate your children in the family so that they can serve the country in the future; and for the tasks of society and the country, you must shoulder the easy task of promoting national products and the responsibility of being happy to use national products? As long as everyone has a selfless spirit, whenever you buy something, you must think about where the money is going, and do not buy foreign goods with every penny in your pocket. At the same time, you can inquire about the store clerk with a sincere attitude of loving national products, and pay attention to the trademark. Then they will definitely not answer you unfaithfully. And the annual import surplus problem can naturally be broken by everyone's concerted efforts?

### Recollections of the Women's National Products Association (Part Two)

— Jian Hua

However, the situation at that meeting gave me a very "bad" impression. The order of the day was chaotic, the voices were noisy, and the speakers on the stage, though engrossed and red-faced, were still talked and laughed at by the audience. During the voting, people ignored the chairman's instructions and guidance, simply scribbled a few names, dropped them into the ballot box, and went to collect gifts on their own. When collecting gifts, people rushed and pushed, causing the goods to be mismatched and impossible to verify, resulting in statements that it was okay to take them at random, making it difficult for the organizers to know what to do. Such situations were endless. In summary, they seem to be no more than the following two points: ㊀ Women neglect spirit too much ㊁ Women value material things too much.

Regarding the first point, I hope that women, in future gatherings of this kind of national products movement (because the national products movement, that is, the national products movement, in fact, all gatherings should be like this) first "solemn and respectful" "silent and calm" do not talk freely unless there is an opinion to be expressed, and do not leave the seat without authorization unless there is an important matter. Voting must be carried out in accordance with the method instructed by the chairman, and it is also necessary to recognize whether the elected person is suitable for the position.

Regarding the second point, most of the gifts are enthusiastically solicited from various parties, and the organizers are obliged to distribute them. Those who receive the gifts should not regard this unexpected harvest as a vested interest. It is gratifying to receive them, and there is nothing to complain about if they are lost. When collecting gifts, you should follow the order number to avoid errors, on the one hand, to avoid making it difficult for the organizers, and on the other hand, to avoid being laughed at by those who know better.

The above two points are based on the facts at the time, and are specially raised by the author, please reflect deeply on them in our women's circles. As for the fact that there were many people who could abide by the order at that time, those in the above situation were only a minority, but it is still hoped that everyone will "correct if you have them, and encourage if you don't."

### The National Goods Sector in One Week

Shou Moqing, manager of the Guangzhou National Products Company, came to Shanghai to contact various parties to prepare for the opening of a national products exhibition in Guangdong.

The Ministry of Railways has set a special price for the freight of domestic educational supplies.

The Hebei Province Handicraft Exhibition opened on February 25, and the Jiangsu Province Handicraft Exhibition opened on March 1.

Members of the China Industrial Federation's Guangdong and Guangxi inspection group hosted a banquet for the Chairman of Guangxi Province, Huang Xuchu.

Mr. Hu Xiyuan, general manager of the China Ya Pu Er Factory, and Mr. Cai Shengbai, manager of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, went to Hangzhou together to promote business.

Mr. Qian Xinzhai announced the recent progress of the China National Products United Operations Company, and said that the stock funds can be fully paid soon, and the future is very promising.

Shanghai's national goods groups suggested that the New Games advocate the Civil Servant National Products Year.

The Dutch shield depreciated, and the export of national goods to Nanyang was very smooth. The China Foreign Trade Association is watching the hand to proceed.

The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association and the Singapore Bank of China jointly run the Singapore National Products Exhibition Hall, and there are already more than 20 participating manufacturers.

### Haiqing Defeats Xiqing in Western Youth Volleyball League Yesterday

Reversing the Loss After Losing the First Set

Western Youth Group A volleyball, since Haiqing accidentally suffered a crushing defeat to the Russian army last week, the championship that they were very confident in has been shaken, making the Xiqing team, who had defeated the Russian army, have a great momentum to catch up. Yesterday night, Haiqing and Xiqing met, which is the key to whether Haiqing can retain the championship, and also the final decision of Haiqing's fate this year. Chinese and Western spectators also had good eyesight, predicting that this game must be exciting, so hundreds of people gathered to watch. With the help of the fierce general Borokofev, Xiqing's momentum was extremely strong. Not long after the battle, Xiqing took the lead, and after 9-6, it quickly increased to 14. Haiqing struggled hard, but was finally won by Xiqing with 15-10, winning the first set first. At the beginning of the second set, Haiqing gradually returned to normal, scoring 6 points in one fell swoop. Before long, Xiqing also scored 4 points in a row, chasing to 4-6. After that, Haiqing relied solely on Zheng Yiquan's outstanding achievements, and was able to exchange two for one each time, so the score was increased to 8-4, 10-5, and even 13-6. Unexpectedly, Xiqing chased again to 9-13, which was quite powerful. After 11-14, the overall situation gradually stabilized. However, Xiqing fought like a trapped beast, adding two more points. Fortunately, Zheng Yiquan smashed successfully, and finally tied the score with 15-11, reversing the danger. In the final deciding game, Haiqing won the first two points. Afterwards, it became two each, three each, and even four each. The progress was very average. After 4-4, Haiqing went all out, and the momentum was like a broken bamboo. When it was 10-4, Xiqing called a timeout to avoid its edge. After reaching 13-4, Xiqing's peak turned around, and it was active again, increasing to 9-13. The two sides fought for the serve for a long time. Finally, Haiqing added one point, making it 14-7. Although Xiqing had surplus strength, after adding another point, it was finally smashed obliquely by Mai Bingyao, losing with 8-15. Haiqing was lucky to reverse the loss with a score of 2-1. However, the situation was shocking, extending the original scheduled time by more than half an hour. From now on, Haiqing only needs to work hard in the second cycle, and there is still great hope for the championship. In another game, the Russian army defeated Suer with a score of 2-0, and the situation was one-sided. The results are as follows:

Haiqing: Zheng Yiquan, Mai Bingyao, Bao Entun, Zhang Renming, Yang Zhiqiang, Verodagai.

### Central Youth Women's Basketball Team Fails to Form Due to Insufficient Numbers

The 7th Central Youth Basketball Games were originally divided into four groups: school, commercial bank, bank, and women. Now the bank group was successfully concluded last week, the commercial bank group has also reached the final stage, and the school group has also begun to compete. However, the women's group has not yet started due to too few registrations. When the women's group started registering, there were originally five teams registered: Qixiu, Black Hawk, Mickey Mouse, Flying Rainbow, and Muir. After the Black Hawk and Muir teams successively requested to withdraw for some reason, only three teams were left. According to the regulations, those with less than four teams cannot be held, so the committee has decided to temporarily suspend the women's group for one year in this competition. Today, because the bank group has ended, there are only four games in the commercial bank group. The order is as follows:

(1) Meizui vs. Lingdong (Commercial 4) 5:30 pm, (2) Zhanghua vs. Pingdui (Commercial 3) 6:15 pm, (3) Youdui vs. Nanshui (Commercial 2) 7:00 pm, (4) Hezong vs. Tongren (Commercial 1) 7:45 pm.

### Japanese New Cabinet Advocates Sino-Japanese Cultural and Educational Cooperation

Hayashi's Statement Emphasizes Cultural Contact

University Professors Study Chinese Culture

Students in Japan Under Police Protection

(Tokyo Special Dispatch) Since the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet, there has been extensive discussion on the country's foreign and domestic policies, with a focus on China. The emphasis is on people-to-people contact, with cultural and educational cooperation as the primary objective. Economic cooperation will also adopt a new approach, starting with cultural initiatives and gradually exploring Sino-Japanese economic issues. The Hayashi cabinet has already declared its policy towards China, emphasizing cultural contact to foster goodwill between the two nations. This marks the first public statement from the Japanese authorities regarding Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation. Since the Xi'an Incident, the Japanese education sector has become deeply aware of China's political and economic progress. Pro-China university professors are studying China's progress over the past decade, dividing it into two periods: the first from 1928 to the Manchurian Incident, and the second from the Incident to the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. They have extensively researched the reasons for the failure of the North China Education and Culture Committee and have meticulously gathered historical materials on student movements in Beiping (Beijing), including detailed information on the committee member lists and organizational outlines of the Beiping Student Union's first, second, third, fourth, and fifth sessions. Detailed investigations have also been conducted on the stances and factions of professors at universities in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai. In Beiping, Chiang Meng-lin and Hu Shih belong to one faction, while Li Shuhua and Li Shengzhang belong to another, and professors who returned from studying in Japan form yet another. The influence of Lu Xun's literature and thought on Chinese youth is also under study. In the political arena, they have collected historical materials on the Tanggu Truce, the East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council, the Southwest Cooperation, and the Xi'an Incident. In the economic sphere, they have conducted thorough research on currency unification and financial stability after the Xi'an Incident. This reveals the Japanese scholars' deep interest in the trends of Chinese culture, education, politics, and economics. Recently, the conflict between the Student Federation and the Fellow Students Association, both organizations of students studying in Japan, has prompted Japanese professors to gather various materials for research. Since the conflict between the two factions of Chinese students, the Japanese Metropolitan Police Department has been paying close attention to the movements of Chinese students. Currently, students studying in Japan are receiving special protection from the police. It is hoped that Chinese students in Japan will not allow outsiders to mock them for being disunited and will strive for unity like their motherland. Organizing groups is a small matter; national unity is paramount. While abroad, they should maintain contact, study hard, and contribute to their homeland in the future, refraining from infighting to demonstrate the progress of Chinese students to their neighbors. Since the deportation of the staff of the Dongfang News Agency, students studying in Japan at various universities in Tokyo have become keenly aware of the impropriety of overseas activities. Consequently, there has been a change in attitude, with a focus on academic research. Due to the upcoming university examinations (Japan's academic year begins in spring), many Chinese students can be found in libraries. Sun Xihong and Tan Shuqian from the Imperial University, Zhang Yinman from the Commercial University, Zheng Tianlin from Waseda University, and Yao Dihong from Meiji University all have new publications forthcoming.

Auxiliary Coin Exchange Rates Are Still Inconsistent

Exchange Rates Can Be Said To Be:

From South to North

From High to Low

South Market Exchange Rate 2970 Cash

Equals 99 One-Cent Coins

The Exchange Rate for Copper Coins, at the End of the Old Lunar Year, Reached a Low of 2820 Cash, (Around Mid-February), Since After the Lantern Festival, the Exchange Rate Has Been Increasing Daily, There Was Also an Incident in the Middle, That is, the Central Bank Entrusted the Business of Exchanging One-Cent Copper Coins to the Tobacco Exchange Industry, But the Exchange Rate for Old Copper Coins, Although There Were Constraints, Still Could Not Make the Exchange Rates Between the Two Equal, Until Recently, There Has Been a Gradual Hope of Equalizing, For Example, in the South Market, the Copper Coin Exchange Rate, Per One Legal Currency Yuan, Can Be Exchanged for 2970 Cash, Which Is Equal to 99 One-Cent Auxiliary Coins, What Is Not Equal, Even Exchanging for 2980 Cash, Which Is Exchanging for 10 More Cash, Is Even More Common,

The Auxiliary Coin Exchange Rate in Shanghai Is Not Uniform, But There Is Also a Similar Pattern, Which Can Be Called "From South to North, From High to Low," Although This Is an Inductive Statement, the General Idea Is Not Very Different, That Is, Taking the Most Recent Copper Coin Exchange Rate, in the French Concession Adjacent to the South Market, the Exchange Rate Is Between 2970 Cash and 2950 Cash, With 2950 Cash Being the Majority, and in the Northern Part of the French Concession Close to the British Concession, It Gradually Approaches the Exchange Rate of the British Concession, Between 2945 Cash, Since Entering the British Concession, the Exchange Rate Is Between 2940 Cash and 2920 Cash, The Lowest Is 2900 Cash, This Is a Very Small Number,

The Exchange Rate for Double Hao, the Highest Is in the South Market Area, One Yuan Can Be Exchanged for 10 Jiao 470-480 Cash, Decreasing From Here, There Are Exchanges for 10 Jiao 450, 440, 430, There Are Also Exchanges for 10 Jiao 420 Cash, Which Is Also a Very Small Number,

As For the Exchange Rate From Double Hao to Copper Coins, From 480 Cash to 450 Cash, One Store Can Actually Exchange for 500 Cash, This Is Also Difficult to Encounter,

### Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (1)

— Pan Shihao

In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the government planned to implement income tax, and the Shanghai Banking Association's Banking Weekly published a special issue on income tax issues to advocate it. At that time, I happened to be involved in the editing of the Banking Weekly, and I also wrote an article from the standpoint of regulating the social economy to show my promotion. It has been fifteen or sixteen years now. Later, I tried to implement it many times, but failed many times, until recently, it was implemented by the National Government. Promoting good taxes to regulate the social economy and alleviate the difficulties of national finance is indeed a gratifying thing. However, the calculation of income tax and the procedures for filing returns are very complicated. Any inadequacy will be hindered. Recently, industry and commerce have failed to file various return forms on time because they do not understand the filing procedures. Therefore, based on my personal understanding, I will explain the compilation and filing methods of various return forms, so as to alleviate the difficulties of industry and commerce and contribute to the promotion of income tax. However, it is only done during leisure time, in bits and pieces, and omissions are unavoidable. If readers correct me, it is especially hoped.

(1) Business Report Form

According to Article 46 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, companies, commercial firms, banks, factories, and profit-making individuals shall, within one month from the date of implementation of these Detailed Rules, report their names, addresses, businesses, capital or paid-in capital amounts to the local competent collection agency. The business report form is the form used by commercial firms, banks, factories, and profit-making individuals that are not company organizations to report the above-mentioned matters. Those banks, factories, etc. that belong to the company organization shall use the company report form to report. The matters that should be filled in in this book are explained as follows:

(1) Name: All commercial firms, banks, factories, and profit-making individuals must have a certain name. For example, Huaxin Woodware Shop, Jingtaide Rice Shop, Continental Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yu Da Xieji Shop, etc. The "Name" and "Business" positions in the form should be completely filled in based on the facts. Those who have registered as a commercial firm and those who have filled in the name of the commercial firm in the trademark license. The name filled in in this form should be the same as it. Although this form is called the Business Report Form, according to the provisions of Article 46 of the Implementing Rules, its scope of application is not limited to "Banks" and "Shops", but also applies to "Warehouses", "Factories" and other categories.

(2) Name of Responsible Person: The responsible person is the person who is responsible for paying income tax. In principle, it should be the manager, factory director, and owner of the business. The position and name should be clearly stated when filling in. According to Article 27 of the Implementing Rules, the method of paying income tax, which belongs to Category A and Category B income of the first category of profit-making business income (that is, continued profit-making income), is paid by the business responsible person himself. For those belonging to Category C income of the first category and salary remuneration income of the second category, and securities deposit income of the third category, the principle is that the business responsible person of the payment agency shall withhold and pay on his behalf. Only those without payment agencies or owners of the first category of Category C income and the second category of income shall pay by the taxpayer or his agent. The responsible person filled in in this form should have the same nature as this kind of business responsible person. Although Article 46 of the Implementing Rules does not clearly stipulate that the name of the responsible person must be declared. However, the bank should have a certain responsible person, and it is reasonable to list this as a matter that should be declared in this form. (Unfinished)

Spring and Autumn

### Environment

— (Drunken Woodcutter)

The environment is like the outer iron shell of a bomb, and people are the gunpowder hidden inside. If this bomb is not pushed, and it is quietly left there, then the highly explosive gunpowder cannot develop its special characteristics, which is like a person living in a comfortable environment, and he is unwilling to do anything, and at the same time he has failed in the great responsibility that life has in society: so we need a harsh environment to shake us, so that our spirit of struggle can explode with magnificent sparks, and fulfill our duty as human beings!

However, many young people hate the harsh environment; at the same time, they also misunderstand the purpose of struggling against the harsh environment, so they go in the opposite direction, they shout: "We want to jump out of the bad environment and find our new path!" That's like those who don't know how to use bombs, and blow themselves up instead! In fact, the new path should be reached by fighting in a harsh environment, not fearing hardship, and working hard to move forward!

For example, if we want to go to a certain place, but we must pass through a desert area, if we feel that the desert area is not good for walking, then the destination will never be reached! If we want to get there, we have to run through this section of the desert; if we say we want to take a detour, first, we will waste time, and second, we will inevitably go astray, and it will be too late to regret!

Here we have an important theory of being human: that is, "seeking oneself" and "believing in oneself", seeking oneself, only oneself is the most reliable helper: believing in oneself, will not be deceived or tempted by anyone, then we can also run quickly on the road to success!

### Thoughts on the Friends' Festival

— Hai

Today, the third day of the third month, is the Friends' Festival. I have never heard of the term "Friends' Festival" before. Who knew that its creation has already been four years in the making?

The initiator is none other than Mr. Huang Jingwan, the owner of Wanyou Yuan and a social scientist. No one but him would do such a thing.

What's the reason?

Because who else besides him is worthy of being called the owner of Wanyou Yuan?

I heard him say to me:

"My whole life has depended on my friends to help me, and I also eat the food provided by my friends. If I didn't have friends, I wouldn't have food to eat! I really can't count how many friends I have now! Probably no less than two hundred thousand people."

After hearing his words, we felt that he was indeed correct. However, among the friends we make, we can't find a single good one, and in the end, we always suffer losses ourselves. I myself have been badly deceived by friends! It is evident that the most difficult thing to find in society is a true friend.

According to this, should we not make friends? No, how can a person not have friends? We see that in Mr. Wan's book "Social Etiquette", there is also a section saying that he himself has encountered a bad friend.

Friends are indeed indispensable today, but we should always treat friends with "respect" and "love." People are not plants or trees; we can always get help from friends! We only need to follow the saying of the sage: "When walking with two others, one of them will surely be able to teach me something." Just do that.

Therefore, the creation of the Friends' Festival is what we need most. It is not only to increase mutual friendship but also to restore our inherent Chinese morality.

### "Almost"

— Jiao Shijie

In fact, no matter what a person does, there must be certainty. One is one, and two is two. Don't ever say "how many people are there?" "Almost seven or eight." This kind of "almost" answer is an uncertain answer. Allow me to tell you two facts for your consideration.

A man named Huang is an accountant in a certain firm. He particularly likes to say "almost." One night, the manager came and asked Mr. Huang: "How is the account today? How much money is there?" Mr. Huang replied, "Almost, the money in the account is almost." The manager asked him again, "Is it more? Is it less? Or is it just right?" He still kept saying "almost." Later, the manager himself said, "I just took a ride in a rickshaw, and because I didn't have any money with me, I borrowed two dimes from the account. It's still in the account now." Then Mr. Huang said, "That's more like it!"

There is also a Mr. Li who mispronounces words and is a believer in Buddhism, often chanting scriptures and eating vegetarian food. Once, he said to people, "For these three days, I will be 'Qí jiè mù yù' again." Everyone listened to him, not understanding, thinking he was talking about some profound Buddhist philosophy. Later, he wrote the characters out, and it turned out to be "Zhāi jiè mù yù". This made everyone burst into laughter. He blushed, and everyone asked him again, "Are 'zhāi' and 'qí' the same?" He said, "Isn't that 'almost' the same? What's so funny!"

After reading the two stories above, everyone can understand that those who cannot be certain and those who knowingly refuse to admit their mistakes will never gain people's trust. Although they always use the word "almost" to shirk responsibility, sometimes there is no way to avoid saying "almost." Please see the following anecdote:

Zhang, Wang, Li, and Guo happened to be together, and they all had the same fondness for playing mahjong. So, they immediately started a game of mahjong. It was made clear beforehand that if you called "win" incorrectly, you would have to pay. After a few rounds, Mr. Zhang, with both "pong" and "chow," waited to "win" with two pairs of "sixes of bamboo" and "nines of dots". Mr. Wang played a "nine of bamboo," and Mr. Zhang called "win" across the river. Upon inspection, it was actually a "six of bamboo," so of course, he called "win" incorrectly. So everyone wanted Mr. Zhang to pay. Mr. Zhang said, "Don't 'six of bamboo' and 'nine of bamboo' look 'almost' the same? You can't count that as me calling 'win' incorrectly." But the other three did not let it go just because it was "almost" the same. As a result, Mr. Zhang had to pay up.

From this, we can know that even if you are cunning and say "almost," sometimes you cannot shirk responsibility. Therefore, no matter what you do, you should never have an "almost" mentality and must take responsibility for everything you do and speak with certainty.

Lan sat upright and said to the Second Young Mistress in a serious tone: "Second Sister-in-law, are these words you said today what Mother asked you to inform me of? Or did you reveal them unintentionally?" The Second Young Mistress showed a look of surprise on her face and shook her hands at the same time, saying: "My sister, let's just say this. Not only did Mother not ask me to tell you, but she also told us not to spread this matter to your ears. There is no other intention. It's just that I'm afraid you'll worry for no reason when you hear it. You don't know, if you have any worried look, Mother will inevitably inquire about it everywhere, asking what it's for. She knows that you won't be happy to hear about this matter, and there are still some days left, would she be willing to tell you so early? Sister, you are an intelligent person, what do you not know? You probably read more books than we know characters. We don't have the guts to play tricks in front of you. Good sister, let's just say this and end it here, no need to mention it again." As she spoke, she stood up, showing that she was sincerely afraid and dared not take responsibility. Menglan leaned against the edge of the table, bit her lip slightly, looked at the tips of her shoes, crossed her fingers, put them in her arms, and was lost in thought. The Second Young Mistress said: "Sister, what's wrong with you? I only advised you not to worry, but you still want to worry." Menglan took a breath and said: "No matter who is in my situation, they can't help but worry, right?" The Second Young Mistress stomped her feet lightly on the floor and said: "Oh! That's my words were wrong." Menglan waved her hand and said: "No, I understand it a long time ago. It's like the prisoners in the death row, although they don't know which day they will go to the execution ground, they know very well in their hearts that the end is not far away." The Second Young Mistress blushed when she heard her say such serious words. Menglan said: "Second Sister-in-law, do you think my words are too harsh? I think these are the words that need to be said from the bottom of my heart. Just tell me, which day is it?" The Second Young Mistress smiled bitterly and said: "If I tell you, you'll be forcing me." Menglan poured a cup of tea, held it to her mouth with her right hand, supported the elbow of her right arm with her left hand, took a sip of tea, looked up at the ceiling, finished drinking the tea, and then nodded twice. The Second Young Mistress smiled and said: "Second Sister, do you also think that what I'm worried about is correct?" (140)

Personal Sketches

### Master Hong Ji

— Zhu Chengxi

I heard that Mr. Cha Mengji became a monk four years ago, with the Dharma name Master Hong Ji. Even though he is still a professor of Chinese Studies at the Law School and Jianguo Middle School.

I have been separated from him for many years. This time, I went to visit him incidentally.

The room was filled with the fragrance of sandalwood. Incense smoke swirled in front of the Buddha statue. The master was silently compiling the Chinese Studies lecture notes for the Law School.

"Teacher Cha, do you still recognize me?" He scrutinized me carefully for a while and actually said, "Zhu Chengxi, right? I remember!"

After sitting idly for a while, I wanted to discuss with him the reason for becoming a monk. I raised many questions, but he always just smiled and did not answer! He got up to add incense and tapped the chime stone "ding" once.

"Let's talk about your life!" He began to ask about my life. I answered him haphazardly, but never talked about "becoming a monk" or "Buddha." Perhaps ordinary people are not worthy of talking about Buddha!

I began to browse the room, which served as a Buddhist hall, an office, and a bedroom. On the wall hung many paintings of Buddhas and couplets. In the middle was a couplet written by the master himself: "Returning to the origin, there is no second path; there are many doors for convenience." A Buddha statue was enshrined on the table by the window, with incense burning, and Buddhist instruments such as wooden fish and chime stone were placed there. The "Lankavatara Sutra" and other scriptures were stacked there. There was also a futon on the ground, which was said to be where the master meditated and did his morning and evening prayers.

In another corner hung a portrait of his beloved mother, with a red paper attached to the side with the eight characters "Honored guests arrive, please decline bowing". There were also the words "Wash the face with water, may all beings attain the pure Dharma door and be forever free from defilement" at the washing place.

As I was examining everything, Mr. Yuan Yeyu suddenly walked in with a stack of books. He was also my former teacher and was very concerned, asking about my well-being. At that time, the master suddenly pointed to a large cake on the table and said to Mr. Yuan, "This cake has been left there since the summer vacation. Look, it's not moldy or spoiled." Mr. Yuan said, "Oh! It's been almost three or four months. This is the miracle of believing in Buddha! Otherwise, the mice would have eaten it!" After a while, the master said again, "I want to keep it there permanently and see what it becomes like after three years!" Then, the three of them smiled knowingly!

Before leaving, I troubled the master to write a few words. He casually wrote with a pen, "Without all suffering, but receiving all joy, in this world, all transcendent Dharma."

When I got home, I flipped through "Gratitude and Becoming a Monk" and "Blocking the Meat-Eating Dharma Door," which Master Hong Ji had given me, and I really couldn't figure out why Teacher Cha became a monk. I remember that before January 28th, when our alma mater, Jianguo Middle School, was still in Shen Lianfang's "Zhiyuan," Teacher Cha had two things that attracted the attention of the students. One was his broad knowledge. He understood Japanese, English, and French and was also an Esperantist. The tables, shelves, and beds in his room, even the floor, were piled with books of various languages and natures. The other was that he was very close to the female students. I remember once in a Chinese class, he recited aloud the poem of the female student Zhou Gengxuan: "Carrying a gun, bearing a sword, rushing through the battle line, the one I miss! Dangerous, dangerous!" Master Cha probably still doesn't have any impression, does he?

However, he eventually became a monk. His Dharma name is Master Hong Ji.

### A Record of the Gathering of Stars in Suzhou

— Sun Choucheng

The Xing Society held three elegant gatherings last year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Double Ninth Festival, and Lunar New Year's Eve, all in Shanghai. Very few members from Suzhou attended the chrysanthemum viewing at Jinghao Tower. When the Suzhou Library held the Wuzhong Cultural Relics Exhibition this time, because the director, Jiang Yinqiu, was also a member of the society, he discussed it with Mr. Fan Yanqiao, the executive officer, and it was decided to hold it in Suzhou on February 21st. That day was a Sunday, so the Shanghai members could take time off, killing two birds with one stone, and everyone agreed. I went the day before, and the next day, when I visited the Wuzhong Cultural Relics Exhibition with my wife Wu Songru and four children, I met the editor of this journal, Mr. Shoujuan, and Director Jiang. According to them, although it was raining, Tao Lengyue, Zheng Yimei, Xu Bibo, Jiang Hongjiao, Zhao Yanyun, and other gentlemen from Shanghai still came, and Yi Junzuo and Jun from Zhenjiang also rushed to the scene. The banquet was set at the Facing-Water Pavilion of Canglang Pavilion across the street, and Mr. Fan Yanqiao was already hosting. So we went there immediately. Soon, Fan Peiyu, Zhou Kerang, Fan Junbo, Cheng Zhanlu, Fan Jugao, Xu Yunqiu, Willow Junran, Wu Daiqiu, Chen Jia, Gu Moqi, Fan Shaoyun, Zhao Ziyun, and other gentlemen arrived one after another. Some had not seen each other for a long time, and some had only admired each other from afar. Gathering together, they were extremely happy. Yanqiao brought out a small booklet and asked everyone to write a poem to leave a trace of their presence. When Junzuo was writing a poem, Lengyue happened to be beside him. So, in addition to describing the scenery, he also embedded the four characters "Yanqiao Lengyue" into the seven-character quatrain. His talent was quick and agile. If he weren't an expert, how could he have achieved this? When taking photos in front of the Academy of Fine Arts, Gu Mingdao suffered from foot problems and sat alone. Jiang Yinqiu was late due to busy affairs. Everyone compared Gu to Zhang Jingjiang and called Jiang Chairman Jiang. I said: "The architecture of the Academy of Fine Arts is magnificent and comparable to the Central Party Headquarters. Those who don't know will definitely suspect that the people in the photo are important figures in the party-state. The 28th is the number of constellations. Our society is named after stars. The number of people attending today is exactly 28. It can be called a natural match." Everyone laughed loudly. After taking their seats, Yanqiao first asked everyone to stand up one by one and introduce themselves so that everyone could recognize their faces. Then, because Bibo, Yinqiu, Hongjiao, and Junzuo were all 40 years old this year, he asked everyone to stand up and raise a glass together to express their congratulations. I said that today's meeting was quite difficult to achieve. Please add more prints of the photos that have been taken. Yanqiao will fill in everyone's names in order according to their standing positions. Then, those gentlemen who have never met will know who they are when they see the photo and don't need to ask their names again. And we should imitate Wang Xizhi's Orchid Pavilion gathering and elect someone to write a preface to leave a memorial. Shoujuan will draw another picture, and the result is that Junzuo is publicly elected to write the preface, and the painters present each draw a picture, which is mounted into a hand scroll and personally inscribed by everyone, which will be treasured in the Suzhou Provincial Library. I said: "Then, when the Wuzhong Cultural Relics Exhibition is held again in 300 years, this scroll should also be regarded as a treasure for future generations to appreciate." Later, Junzuo distributed the various lyrics and bimonthly publications he wrote about promoting the nation. Yanqiao asked him to sing impromptu. He said that he could only write lyrics but was not good at singing, and a blind friend who was good at music did not come with him this time. It was not until after three o'clock that everyone dispersed happily.

Talking Points

### All Men in the World Are Confused

— I

The previous newspaper reported: Zhang Xueliang and his wife, accompanied by Deng Shiping and others, passed through Ningbo at 10:00 AM on the 26th to visit scenic spots such as Tiantong and Yuwang. They returned to Xikou at 6:00 PM in the evening. It is true that being without official duties brings lightness. One can imagine the pleasure of the virtuous couple enjoying the springs, stones, mountains, and forests, which is very enviable.

I remember when Ms. Yu Fengzhi returned to China the other day, she said to people: "All men in the world are confused. If there are no women to restrain them, they will cause trouble." It can be seen that Ms. Yu Fengzhi's trip with Zhang Xueliang to enjoy the mountains and waters and cultivate their virtues has its own reasons. Isn't this a means for Ms. Yu Fengzhi to restrain her husband?

It is said: "A family with a virtuous wife will not suffer misfortune." This kind of talk was once fashionable in the era of autocracy, which is why virtuous mothers and good wives are so popular. If this saying is brought up again now, I am afraid that the men of the world will inevitably raise a protest, thinking that it is an insult to men. Because the power of the husband is higher than everything else, this is why the women's rights movement is so loudly advocated.

But if I carefully observe the situation in society, the statement that the power of the husband is higher than everything else is nonsense. If the men of the world hear it, they may feel flattered. I see that the men in the world who are afraid of their wives are all good and obedient people. Only those who are not afraid of their wives are truly out of control. Conversely, if one is unfortunate enough to marry an unvirtuous woman, then the family will have many troubles from then on. Therefore, there are filial sons because there are filial daughters-in-law. This saying is true and cannot be falsely accused.

However, Ms. Yu said that all men in the world are confused. This word "all" is inevitably too dogmatic, as if all men in the world are as confused as Zhang Xueliang. Conversely, if all men in the world are confused, does it mean that all women in the world are not confused? This statement inevitably has the suspicion of insulting men. Are all the good men in the world the result of their wives' discipline? Do the men who like to cause trouble all cause trouble because their wives do not strictly discipline them, or because the men are stubborn and do not accept discipline? I am afraid it is not necessarily so.

But I cannot say that Ms. Yu's words are absolutely credible, but they are also partially credible, because there are too many husbands who are afraid of their wives in the world now, and there are really many who are willing to accept the strict control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Even among my friends, those who harbor the fear of Ji Chang are at least half or more. Therefore, those who are now shouting loudly for the women's rights movement often say that women are men's slaves and men's playthings, as if the women of the world are always under the eighteenth level of hell. Alas! What is this? What is this?

Therefore, I say that if the power of the husband is ultimately higher than everything else, then the power of the wife must be higher than everything else. Why? Because all men in the world are confused.

### "Planned Hunger"

— Yingchun

According to a report by the Berlin correspondent of the Reuter's News Agency: According to official statistics, the number of unemployed people in Germany in January reached 1,853,000, of which 700,000 are currently unable to receive any assistance and are bound to suffer from hunger and poverty. Reports from various sources indicate that the amount of food reserves in 1936 has been drastically reduced by two to three times. The recently concluded Berlin Agricultural Exhibition clearly demonstrated the increasingly severe food shortage in fascist Germany. The exhibition was held under the slogan of opposing excessive food quotas. The brochure stated: "On average, Germans eat more fat than necessary. Fat consumption can be reduced by 25%. The same is true for meat consumption. The struggle against excessive food quotas should save about one million marks." As a result of planned hunger, the birth rate has plummeted, and the mortality rate has increased. At the same time, the physical condition of young people drafted into the army is extremely unhealthy. According to the report of the conscription inspection committee, only 75% of the conscripted soldiers last year could be classified as first-class and second-class, 13.6% were physically weak, 9% suffered from indigestion, and 8.9% suffered from heart disease.

In recent years, as a result of Germany's expansion of armaments, the country has repeatedly experienced food and butter panics. Hitler, Goering, Schacht, and others have repeatedly stated: "It is better to save butter and bread to endure hunger than to be without cannons and warships." But how can they satisfy the desires of the German people?

Let's not discuss whether "700,000 people" out of the "1,853,000 people" have starved to death because they could not "get any assistance," or whether there are even more people "waiting to die." But the results of "opposing excessive food quotas" and "planned hunger" have clearly created the phenomenon that "the birth rate has plummeted, and the mortality rate has increased." This, in Hitler's "rewarding childbirth" plan, cannot but be said to be "vastly different"! And what is especially noteworthy is that the "physical condition of the youth" "drafted into the army" is "extremely unhealthy." The total number of people suffering from heart disease, indigestion, and physical weakness actually accounts for 25%, which cannot but be said to be a rather alarming number. Moreover, if this continues, it goes without saying that it will continue to increase. With so many "sick men" in the army, even if airplanes, warships, cannons... etc., are so sharp, how can they defeat all the enemies of the "Third Reich", let alone the dream of completely ruling the world? ...Indeed, this cannot but be said to be a terrible crisis!

Just when Mr. Hitler is planning to covet the Soviet Union and interfere in the internal affairs of Spain, when he is so excited, I am afraid that even he himself has not foreseen what kind of results this "crisis" will lead to, right? So, we mention it here. I don't know if it's "borrowing people's worries"? In fact, there are similar countries in our neighborhood!

### Eyes

— Luo Yu

The struggle of mankind is unfolding in a huge machine. There will be a time when people will feel tired and pray for a window to the soul, right?

After July 193x, I was in such a miserable situation. My stubbornness about a dream had not yet been shattered. In life, all my abilities were probably only consumed by a few percent. It was just like a cow's slow rumination after exhaustion. But on the other hand, I also felt the darkness of my soul.

One afternoon, in that small courtyard, I unexpectedly encountered a pair of eyes. They flashed like weak sparks, and they immediately opened the praying window in my heart. Through that window, I discovered new fields and new skies.

Naturally, it is not easy to stay away from those eyes. So, I moved into that small courtyard. That passionate window kept opening for me, lingering for three to five minutes, allowing me to breathe in the new fields as much as possible and wander in the bright shrub garden. In this way, my days were colored and vibrated with rhythm.

In happiness, I began to gaze at the woman in a black dress standing in the middle of the little girls. When I stood in my door and lingered on the glass grid for a while, those bright eyes slowly lifted up, not allowing any other life to observe, almost as if for my tyranny.

With a tremor, I moved those eyes away, and a black shadow stood in my heart. That woman had curved hair that sometimes hung on her forehead, as if she couldn't overcome fatigue. But every turn of her slender shoulders showed her fullness of vitality. Her thin lips appeared pale, like the paleness of a professional woman. Sometimes she would apply some rouge, but it revealed two pitiful reds. These would make people abandon her, but only those eyes defended her.

In those days, I kept thinking: Is our noblest virtue equal to the brilliance revealed in those eyes, the extremely painful and extremely happy brilliance?

On every page of my diary, I wrote: Those eyes are perhaps the only door to heaven and tomorrow, the only sheath that protects beauty and bravery.

Two months passed. I had not said a word to her. One day, I took a two-hour train to see my mother. I told her about that woman without concealing or exaggerating, quite thinking that she could sympathize with my thoughts. But she said words that made me extremely sad.

That woman was from the same hometown. She grew up on the bend of the river in her hometown. Her mother was a woman who fell into the abyss of the underworld and stained the good neighbors. Her father was a mediocre man carrying a pen like dead ashes. Her brother slowly turned into a rebellious child because he didn't have tuition fees. Her one younger brother was sold by her mother. And she herself was betrothed by her mother to an opium merchant.

"That girl will die of sorrow. People say that she is getting thinner day by day, and that poor girl will suffocate to death"!

I argued against all that ugliness. I said that I wanted to make her live. I hoped that my mother could finally sympathize with me. But she cried, like when I was a child. She said:

"Give up that thought! For the sake of your reputation, for the sake of the slander your father suffered, and even more for the violence he inflicted on your mother. If there were no such unreasonable thoughts, you would all be kind and praised. That principal knows your father and has also praised you. If you remember these things, then turn back"!

I listened to my mother. I endured it.

When I took the train south again one afternoon, I saw those silent eyes hanging on my neck like two arms.

Like millions of bright eyes, let them burst into flames or dry up and die! I want to stay away. I want to leave this city. This is my strategy!

### More

— Shen Bing

Fatigue, like countless insects, crept gradually from the soles of my feet. My body, wrapped in a cotton quilt, curled up in bed, without a trace of sleepiness. Night dreams are always not worth mentioning, right? Trains derailed for no reason into deep ravines. And the unparalleled warriors also sighed deeply because of some meaningless trivial matters.

Wearing pajamas, I stood in front of the stove and stirred up the dying flames. At the window, I used my fingers to wipe away a layer of moisture covering the glass, peering out at the night through the gaps between the finger marks. The wind drove the dots and lines of snow against the window.

The sound of the night watchman's gong was cold. The night was vast and silent. An occasional howling wind rose from afar and disappeared into the distance. The sound of the gong fell into the sea of night, like a stone thrown into a dark puddle, densely spreading out terrifying sound waves like the night itself. The sound of the clapper coming from the distant corner of the house repeated itself in my eardrums.

The sound of the clapper gradually approached, resounding through the dark night. The night watchman, the sound of the gong, and a dim red paper lantern swept past together, from the dark, misty dew to the dark, misty dew, like a ghost. Through the gaps between the finger marks, I saw a black and emaciated figure, wearing a tattered black felt hat. It must be a frail old man. The old man's withered hand carried a lazy, tired, red lantern, unable to illuminate the dense black fog around him. Roadside obstacles lurking with crushing stones, tree roots, and ditches, awaited his carelessness in his thousands of checks.

Passing through the vast silence, the monotonous sound of the clapper sparsely measured the bottomless third watch of the night. The wind drove the dots and lines of snow against the window.

### Moonlit Scene at Hengtang

— Liu Wang

I love the old stone bridge of that ancient building, although compared to the concrete bridge seven or eight zhang away on the same river, it appears too old and too shabby. However, precisely because of this, it suits my eccentric temperament, and I love it.

Every dusk, our group of people who rely on our brains, mouths, and hands to earn a living, would invariably walk towards the stone bridge as soon as we put down our bowls and chopsticks. No one needs to propose it, and no one would deny it. It was as if we were doing a fixed homework, slowly walking in the same direction. It's like this today, like this tomorrow, like this every day, unless the rain occupies the muddy road making it wet and slippery, then everyone would not go to the bridge, and would have to sulk inside. But at this time, sighs would rise one after another.

Behind our office, there is a wide highway, planted with many maple poplars and white poplars on both sides. They are long-lived, lush, and tall. Those heart-shaped leaves rustle in the breeze. We listen to this desolate and solemn sound, walking silently. Only the coal dust on the ground makes a faint "swishing" sound as our shoes brush past, echoing the low sighs of the maple and poplar leaves.

After walking less than a hundred paces on the highway, we are blocked by a river that is not too narrow. The concrete bridge connects to the highway; but the small stone bridge, which is seventy or eighty zhang away, is familiar to the country people and is also loved by us. Every day, we cross the concrete bridge without any reluctance, without stopping, and then take a bend and step onto the stone bridge.

This stone bridge is truly too old. Although we have no way to investigate the year it was built, from its weather-beaten appearance, we cannot help but admit that it was built more than a hundred years ago. On both sides of the stone bridge, the stone railings are already shaking. We sit on them with excessive caution, while more timid friends prefer to sit on the stone steps.

The bridge opening is semicircular, and the arc reflected on the water has caused me to stare at it and spend many nights. Above the circular bridge opening, there is a rectangular yellow stone engraved with the three characters "Hengtang Bridge," without any inscription above or below. Perhaps it was not the negligence of the ancestors, but probably the long years, worn away by wind and rain. At one end of the bridge, there is a kiosk, which was originally intended as a resting place for travelers; but now, it is filled with horse dung, cow dung, and ashes of firewood, and people can no longer walk into it. The selfish behavior of people is fully manifested in this.

On moonlit nights, our enthusiasm is even higher. Some play the harmonica, some sing songs, some recite poetry. It is truly elegant, as if we are all remnants of the Middle Ages, forgetting the strife of the real society. But, I must say that this kind of enthusiasm is excusable, because our group of men and women spend a full ten hours a day using our brains, mouths, hands, and other things on the education of the next generation. It cannot be said that we are not working hard. Isn't this little bit of entertainment very proper?

The moonlight shines on the stone bridge and also on the bodies of our group of men and women. The shadow of the bridge is reflected on the water, and the shadows of the people are reflected on the bridge. And the ancient willow tree beside the bridge also covers us with its figure. On the river, from time to time, there is a sound of "plop, plop," which is faint but very crisp. That is the scene of small fish seeing the moon and being happy, floating on the surface of the water to play. Further away, there are one or two dim red fishing lights, slowly moving and flickering, setting off the gray-black sky behind them, like twinkling stars.

The moon hides in the long strands of the willow tree. One of the older members of our group, who had spent a lot of effort in classical literature, excitedly recited a poem:

"Where does the homesickness arise, the moon over Hengtang at the seventh hour..."

Everyone was struck by his melodious tone and sad mood. We were silent until the distant fishing lights went out.

Young master Yihong and Pinqing, two little ones without suspicion, each with affection. Unexpectedly, the God of Heaven is jealous of beauty, so the beautiful woman is sick and trapped in a city of sorrow. Her delicate body lies in Xiaoxiang Pavilion, and the little maid often brews medicine and tea. Sighing that there are few confidants, her heart is filled with emotion and tears fill her eyes. Suddenly, the parrot cries repeatedly, saying that a guest is knocking on the door, calling for the maid Juan. Hastily ordered the maid to go outside the room and ask who has come and wants to hear clearly. The maid obeyed the order and opened the door, seeing that it was Baoyu who had come, and emotions arose. Because it was rare for him to come at night, it showed that he was naturally amorous and righteous. She hurriedly took the lantern and led him into the door with light steps. She went to the bedside to report, saying that Second Master Bao was walking alone tonight, coming in person to visit the sick, and the servant's sincerity represents the master's welcome. He has arrived at the bedside to see you, and you can ask him to judge what grievances you have. Daiyu listened, filled with mixed feelings, as if seeing the sun after a long rain. She had thousands of words to say, but struggled to softly call out "Cousin". She said that Second Sister-in-law was too deceitful, and she was so melancholic and sick that she was about to sacrifice her life. Although the Old Ancestor treats me kindly, it is difficult for me to voice my grievances when I am sick. Don't expect me to recover without medicine, I fear that we will only meet again in the next life to form an alliance on the mountain. Baoyu listened, his heart startled, and he advised her not to fight with the Wang family, to take care of her body and seek to be well, to put aside all matters, and to hope for good fortune. After giving this advice, he bid farewell, unable to do anything about the injustice. He could only sing a few lines as the opening.

Automobile Special

### Discussion on Reducing Automobile Weight

— Shuo

Analysis of the weight of each part of the car How can the weight be reduced?

The weight of an automobile has a great relationship with both manufacturing and driving. During manufacturing, metal joints, screws, and other such things are essential. Other things like car doors, dashboards, and seats inevitably use heavy and large materials. The cost of materials and manual production will be high. As for driving, the lighter the body weight, the less engine power is required. The consumption of fuel and oil will naturally be economical. Regarding taxation and lighting, these can also decrease as the weight of the car decreases. Regarding the possibility of reducing automobile weight, Mr. Griggs, a body engineer at Hudson Motor Car Company in the United States, elaborated in great detail in a paper he read at a meeting held by the Detroit branch of the Society of Automotive Engineers. Now, a few important points are selected for reference.

The heaviest thing on a car is undoubtedly the body itself. However, the accumulation of smaller parts in other areas also has a significant impact on the weight of the entire car. For example, the glass used for car windows, car doors, and windshields adds up to several tens of pounds. If composite glass is used instead, the weight can be reduced. If some metal sheet parts of the car body can be eliminated and some wire mesh parts can be improved, and if lighter materials are used for car doors and seats, the weight of the entire car can be greatly reduced.

The total weight of a car that we commonly see is roughly three thousand pounds. Most of this weight is on the chassis. The weight of the body is usually nine hundred pounds. In the chassis, three hundred pounds of weight belongs to the frame. In the body, three hundred pounds is the structural weight of the shell, not including the weight of all the doors. In this way, the structural part of the entire body has a weight of six hundred pounds. When calculating the weight of the car body, those that do not belong to the structural part include two hundred and fifty-five pounds for the doors, one hundred and seventy-five pounds for the seats, and fifty-five pounds for the glass. Other decorations and accessories, such as carpets, covers, cardboard, insulation materials, and ironware, weigh a total of one hundred and seventy pounds.

Currently, the weight of metal sheets on the car body (these are the metal sheets that cover the car body) is two hundred pounds. Even if most of them are joined by welding, all the bolts, screws, hinges, etc., still add up to thirty-five pounds. The metal sheets used for parts like the engine hood, radiator, and mudguards do not have a structural bearing relationship, but they are used to cover unsightly machine parts to achieve smoothness and beauty. Their weight totals one hundred and eighty-one pounds.

Now the unibody cars that are already in use, and the improved gains from using light-weight metals to generate sufficient strength, the weight problem when making cars will reach a stage of major change. Regarding the complete application of light-weight metal sheets, the automobile industry has not done as much precise research as the aviation industry. The materials currently used in car manufacturing, especially metal sheets, etc., must use materials of considerable thickness. This is because the surface layer bears a heavy load in supporting it. However, some places are already adopting partial welding. Thicker materials are only used where they are related to the structure. In this way, good results can be seen in terms of weight reduction.

Since the invention of scientific welding, the best results have been achieved in reducing weight. Because all the materials do not need to be overlapped when connected, all the nails and screws are also eliminated. Because by utilizing the welding method, entire car roofs and rear wall panels will not generate additional weight. Chemists also make significant contributions to weight reduction, such as introducing zinc, aluminum, and all synthetic resins for practical application. In actual manufacturing, if one pound of weight can be reduced, then one pound of manufacturing cost can be reduced.

The automobile in 1900 was very rudimentary in manufacturing. It was simply a motor placed on a four-wheeled carriage. During the period from 1910 to 1920, the manufacturing method gradually changed. Every part of the car was planned by experts. Each part was different. After this trend started, the increase in weight could not be avoided. As a result, several companies could not continue to operate because they could not solve this problem. Only a few companies that did not avoid difficulties achieved great success through active improvement. From that time on, the automobile manufacturing industry knew about using metal sheets and major issues such as weight reduction.

In 1937, car manufacturing returned to the situation in 1900. That is, the entire car is a whole. All engine parts, axles, and other parts are assembled into a complete car. At the same time, the influence of style planners is also increasing day by day. When the style of the car changes in each period, the structure must conform to the changed style. Because of the style planners, the structure often cannot be excessively changed.

### Advertising Screen in the Car

— Y

Advertising in public buses is something we often see. However, the position of that type of advertisement cannot be very large. As a result, it is inevitably less effective in attracting the attention of readers. Moreover, the space in some cars is very tight, making it difficult to place advertisements. An advertiser in San Diego, California, named Hawke, came up with a unique idea. He used a film projector to project advertisements onto a screen at the front of the car, and they were all colored, in order to promote passenger attention.

### Automobile Anecdotes

— Yun

Reduced Automobile Accidents in New York City New York is one of the most famous big cities in the world. It has a large population and its vehicular traffic has always been known for being congested. Therefore, the number of automobile accidents is the highest among the large cities in the United States with a population of over 500,000. The police authorities, seeing the increasingly serious accident rate, were deeply concerned about it. Therefore, starting in 1934, they implemented a sectional safety campaign, so that the responsibility for maintaining traffic safety would be shared by all parts of the police department in order to achieve a collaborative effect. In the two years since, the effect has been remarkable. The number of automobile accidents in the entire city has greatly decreased. The reason is that residents and various community groups regard the safety campaign as their own responsibility and cooperate sincerely, so that this good result can be achieved. According to the statistics of Police Commissioner Valentine, taking a nine-month period as an example, from January to September 1934, there were 27,323 vehicle accidents in New York City, resulting in 763 deaths and 32,564 injuries. In the same period in 1936, the number of accidents decreased to 20,176, with 587 deaths and 23,883 injuries. If calculated over a two-year period, the number of deaths decreased by 176, injuries decreased by 8,681, and the number of accidents decreased by 7,147. Comparing the nine-month period in 1936 with 1935 (from January 1st to October 1st), the number of deaths decreased by 125 and the number of injuries decreased by 2,294. The percentage of decrease was 176% for deaths and 8.77% for injuries.

Estimated Number of US Car Exports Last Year The exact statistics for the number of cars manufactured in the United States in 1936 and exported to various parts of the world have not yet been released. However, according to the estimate of Mr. Grayham, Chairman of the Export Committee of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the number should be between 500,000 and 700,000 vehicles. The number of US car exports in 1932 was only 120,000 vehicles. In 1935, it was 508,000 vehicles. Therefore, the automobile business in 1936 can be said to be increasing day by day.

Toolbox Gradually Becoming Unimportant Mr. McMain, director of the Plymouth New York Service Department, recently stated that the progress of new cars in 1937 can be seen from one point, that is, the car's repair toolbox is becoming less and less important. Mr. Mai vaguely stated that not long ago, the toolbox was regarded as one of the most important parts of the car. Car users would carry a full set of repair tools whenever they went out. The number of parts could actually be used for ordinary car maintenance. As for the new cars, they were also equipped with many tools, the more the better. Moreover, the car owner would add the tools that they were used to. Today, the situation is different. The tools for changing tires only include, pliers and other items. there are thousands of miles and never opened the toolbox. Moreover, there are even those who do not even know what part of the car the toolbox is in.

Increased Hiring at the Packard Factory The Packard Factory has seen an increase in hiring due to increased exports. In mid-November, its number of employees reached 9,573. This was the fifth consecutive week that the number of employees has been broken. The highest record in 1935 was the last week of December, when the number of employees reached 6,959. The record last spring was 7,612. However, after mid-month, it reached 8,000 people. Last autumn, due to the addition of an axle factory, the number of employees also increased by 600. When the factory reopened, the number of employees increased by nearly 1,200.

Unclear Road View Makes It Very Easy to Have an Accident There are many reasons for automobile accidents. Accidents caused by unclear road views while driving are also one of the main reasons. According to Mr. Harley in the United States, roads with short lines of sight, such as mountain hills with turns in front that block the driver's view of the road ahead, are most prone to accidents. The American Society of Engineers has suggested that roads with a 1,000-foot road view are suitable for safe driving. Therefore, Mr. Harley also advocates that for two-way four-lane roads, drivers should have a clear view of the road ahead for at least 1,000 feet. For three-lane traffic, 1,500 feet is required to be considered safe.

Two New Inventions for Car Equipment There are two new inventions for car equipment in the American automobile industry. They are listed as follows. ㊀ Sand Spreader. When cars drive on icy or rainy roads, they often lose their balance due to excessive slippage, resulting in accidents. Mr. Borang, Deputy Director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at New York University, has recently invented a kind of sand spreader. It is quite ingenious to transform the obstacle remover at the front end of the car. The method is to modify the obstacle remover into a sand box. The upper end opens with a door for forming sand. A button connects it to the management dashboard. When sand is needed, it can be done with a move of the hand, and the effect is immediately visible. ㊁ Convertible Top. Convertible tops are most popular with ladies traveling on beautiful spring and summer days. However, there is one regret, that is, the installation of the car top is quite troublesome. A company in New York, USA, has recently created a car top that can be automatically opened. It only takes one or two seconds to install it properly. The principle is to use compressed air. The air storage tank is hidden inside the car and does not take up much space. The air pressure stored in it can be used to open and lower the car top fifteen times. Its operation does not interfere with parking or driving.

### The Value of Modern Automobiles

"Those who purchase modern American automobiles rarely know the real value they receive. Most people think that the heavier the car, the greater its power. However, Mr. Ford thinks otherwise. Years ago, when he was the general manager of a certain railway, he began to propose using lighter railway equipment. At that time, few understood, and some even criticized him. Now we can see that trains made of lighter metal are breaking all records. If a car reaches a lighter weight, its power also increases for the following two reasons:

㊀ Due to simple design. ㊁ Due to the development of special steels for each part. Currently, Ford cars use about thirty-six kinds of specially developed steels. Naturally, the weight is lighter, and the price is also lower. In 1935, automobiles were worth US$41 per hundred pounds, or 41 cents per pound. The new Ford cars that have just been displayed have one type that is worth about 20 cents per pound. This way of estimating the value of automobiles is certainly unusual, but it shows how automobiles compare to other necessities of life. American steak costs US$0.30 per pound, an electric refrigerator costs about US$0.40 per pound, a piano costs about US$0.87 per pound, good, unwired broadcloth costs about US$1.65 per pound, and a suit costs about US$7.50 per pound. All of these are excellent values, while the value of automobiles is US$0.20 per pound. This kind of news is worth knowing. Years ago, if you wanted to buy all the features of a Ford that is now worth US$480, it would have been difficult to do so even for US$15,000. This assumes that the various improvements of today were already available at that time. In fact, at that time, all these features were missing. Among the masses, there are always clever people who will say, "Oh, I know why the price can be reduced, and the real value has increased. I'm afraid you've been reducing the labor hours!" In fact, taking the entire automobile industry as a whole, for the same automobile production volume, in 1929, it took 74 workers, while now it takes 78 workers. This is only seven years ago. Therefore, the number of workers employed per car has increased. Why is this? Is it because the efficiency of the workers is not as good as before? Or is it because the management is not as focused as before? Neither is the case. The real reason is that the new cars require more assembly and completion work than before. Because every part of the car itself is better than before, both time and work have increased. Therefore, in addition to supplying us with commodities, the automobile industry has also established a great principle: the more superior and beautiful an item is, the more accessible it is to the public. Only crude and imprecise products, and those full of errors, are expensive."
