[London] In a written response to a question from a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, stated, "The British Government is currently in constant communication with Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, British Ambassador to China, and has informed him that the British Government, whenever an opportunity arises, will do its utmost to seek a peaceful resolution to the current dispute between China and Japan." (15th Havas Dispatch from Central News Agency)

[London] London is paying very close attention to the troubling events in China. The House of Commons again had various inquiries regarding the North China crisis today. Simultaneously, Britain, France, and the United States continue to exchange information they have obtained regarding the development of the situation. The British and American governments have both separately notified the Japanese government, explaining that the current conflict in North China originated from a minor cause and should not be used to expand the dispute. Britain also stated in its notification that any attempt by China or Japan to expand this matter into a question of national prestige would become a matter of the utmost importance to Britain. The latest news received in London from Tokyo is not reassuring. The Japanese side claims that the conflict was not a pre-planned event, and the Japanese government is not deliberately delaying a resolution. London is taking this with a grain of salt, and thus the British government does not see any reason to offer mediation at this time. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Conservative MP Morgan that he has been in frequent contact with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi in the past few days. Ambassador Guo has repeatedly provided reports regarding the situation, which are not significantly different from those already revealed in the newspapers. He has stated to Ambassador Guo that the British government will use every opportunity to contribute to a peaceful resolution to the best of its ability. Conservative MP Purbrick spoke, advocating that Britain suggest to relevant powers that Article 9 of the Boxer Protocol be abolished, as Peiping is no longer the capital of China, and powers other than Japan do not have much trade relations with Peiping. Cranborne replied that Article 9 of the agreement stipulates that certain countries may station troops in certain areas of North China to maintain communication between Peiping and the coast, with the aim of ensuring the safety of the embassies. Some embassies still remain in Peiping today. As for commercial relations, they were not considered at the time. Labour MP McKean mentioned that Anglo-Japanese talks should wait until the current dispute in North China is over, as such talks may be seen as British endorsement of Japanese actions. Cranborne replied that there is no firm date for when Anglo-Japanese talks will begin. (16th Reuters Dispatch from Central News Agency)

[London] Since the outbreak of the North China incident, Britain and France originally intended to act according to the Chinese government's suggestion and propose that the governments of Britain, France, and the United States take joint action, conducting negotiations simultaneously in London, Paris, and Washington. However, the United States government does not want to participate in any kind of diplomatic front and believes that the above proposal is inconvenient to accept. Therefore, the policy has been changed. It is now heard that the British and American governments have decided to negotiate separately with the Japanese government to maintain peace and obtain a friendly resolution to the current dispute between China and Japan. As far as responsible sources know, France will also put forward negotiations similar to those of Britain and the United States. However, what kind of intentions the Soviet government holds is still unknown. As for whether the British government has notified the Soviet government of its intentions, it seems that diplomatic circles here do not have this impression. It is obvious that Britain does not want to show any kind of joint and consistent action with Russia in China. Furthermore, the general public here believes that the Chinese government is firmly resisting Japan's annexation of North China, so they are extremely concerned about the development of the situation in the Far East and predict that the trend of the situation's development will be clear within the next forty-eight hours.

[Guling] The first summer training session will conclude on the 17th, after two weeks of training.

(16th Special Dispatch)

[Guling] The Lushan Conference was held at the Guling Library at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, with a total of 158 guests and hosts attending. At 9:00 AM sharp, Chairman Wang and Chairman Chiang, the inviters of the conference, arrived simultaneously. After the meeting began, Chairman Wang presided and Chief Secretary Zhang Yuejun reported. Chairman Wang gave a speech, citing the current important issues and hoping that the guests would express their opinions and criticisms as much as possible. After the chairman's speech, guest Zhang Junmai spoke first, saying that before the establishment of the Republic of China, the opinions of various parties in the country may have been different. After the establishment of the Republic of China, opinions on national love were completely consistent. After the 13th year of the Republic of China, individuals may have had different views on certain issues. However, in summary, in the 25 years since the founding of the Republic of China, they all sincerely hoped for the completion of Sun Yat-sen's ideals and the KMT's aspirations for nation-building. Currently, the national crisis is serious. At this time, the importance of national survival surpasses everything else. There must be a nation first before we can talk about other things. Amidst the cries for sincere unity, those in opposition should express trust and goodwill towards the government. I especially solemnly express this intention. After Zhang’s speech, Zhang Zhirang spoke, saying that at the critical moment of national survival, the whole country should unanimously obey the government on all issues, and hoped that the government would quickly improve freedom of speech, special criminal laws, and news censorship. Then, Wang Yunwu spoke, saying that most people in the country today trust that the government is prepared for national salvation, but how our people can contribute their strength to the rear is something we especially hope the government will instruct us on. Then, Zhang Shouyong spoke, saying that there is no room for criticism of the Three Principles of the People. Even if some people doubt the first article of the draft constitution today, it will definitely be able to reflect the psychology of the majority of the people in the National Assembly in the future and be truly established. However, I hope that the government will reward and punish without fail and enrich its prestige. Then, Hui Qi said that in order to achieve the completion of a modern nation, we must first seek the modernization of the national form. Therefore, there must be a government supported by the entire people, an organ representing public opinion, and a government agency operating according to the constitution. Regarding the constitution, the whole country values ​​spiritual unity, without seeking unity on the content of the articles. As I listened to the issues discussed by the chairman, the government's actual policies and the KMT's political program have changed due to the necessities of the times. If the various issues in the constitution can pay attention to this condition, they will naturally be easily resolved satisfactorily. Finally, Jiang Wenyu talked about national defense education, saying that all issues, especially the must be organized under the leadership of the government. The talks ended at 11:00 AM. The atmosphere at the venue was solemn and harmonious, and the spirit was greatly boosted. At noon on the 16th, Chairman Wang and Chairman Chiang hosted a luncheon for all the participants of the conference in the library auditorium. After the meal, Chairman Wang stood up to give a speech, encouraging the nation's outstanding individuals to unanimously cultivate vitality and enhance strength in the face of heavy pressure on the nation's life. At the end, guest representative Hu Shi gave a reply, saying that what was expressed at today's meeting was enough to represent the unity of the entire nation. Today, the nation is above all else. All the views expressed by various parties in the conference can be based on this common point. The nation's unity is most gratifying. The conference will take a break on the afternoon of the 16th and continue on the morning of the 17th at 9:00 AM. On the 18th, all guests will be invited to Haihui Temple for lunch. Those who cannot go will be invited to lunch in Guling by Chairman Wang. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Guling] At the Lushan Conference, Chairman Wang delivered the following introductory remarks: "Gentlemen, thank you for coming from afar to participate in the joint discussions during the summer vacation, which is most gratifying. The purpose of our inviting you to participate in joint discussions is that, due to our respective duties, we cannot often be in one place. All of our aspirations and opinions on various national and social issues are not easily subject to mutual exchanges and encouragement. Now, with this summer vacation joint discussion, there is great significance in gathering wisdom. A large part of the people participating in the discussion are working in schools or other social bodies. Although few directly participate in political affairs, they must have many great insights on how to resolve the national crisis and how to restore the nation, and I hope to benefit from this opportunity. Another part of the people are working in party affairs and government affairs agencies. If you inquire about party affairs and government affairs, they will certainly be able to explain them based on their experience. We firmly believe that the exchange of opinions between the two sides will be beneficial to both sides. Regarding policy guidelines, all previous national congresses and plenary meetings of the Central Executive Committee have made solemn declarations. The government guides everything according to these policy guidelines. You all know very clearly what is seen in documents and what is seen in actions. Therefore, we intend to say less during the joint discussions and leave more time to listen to your words, hoping that you will know everything and say everything, criticize as much as possible, and express your opinions as much as possible, without any reservation or hesitation. The current urgent task is how to resolve the national crisis and revitalize the nation, which involves complex relationships and many issues, such as political issues, diplomatic issues, economic and financial issues, educational issues, etc. The method of discussion is to focus on one issue in each discussion, so that the discussion can have some boundaries. We will now make an introduction, the meaning of which is to briefly describe the past situation. As for how to do things now and how to do things in the future, we are willing to fully listen to your high opinions. Since September 18th, spiritual unity and jointly facing the national crisis have become the consistent slogans of the whole country. Jointly facing the national crisis is our common goal, and spiritual unity is the necessary step to achieve this goal. In recent years, not only our party comrades have shared this intention and worked tirelessly, but also powerful figures in the intellectual and industrial circles of the country have shared this intention. Regarding the national crisis, we should only try to remedy it, and not lightly destroy it because of differences in opinions or policies. We should understand and assist the government's difficulties. These kinds of painstaking efforts and good intentions are important factors that have gradually formed the unified cause in recent years. Recently, the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly broke out, and the critical situation has become more serious. The fundamental method is still to unite sincerely and melt the nation's mental and material strength into one, so that we can resist strong enemies and save ourselves from danger. Since the First National Congress convened by Premier Sun Yat-sen in January of the 13th year of the Republic of China, the party has issued the Outline of National Construction of the National Government. The party comrades have shared confidence and worked together to achieve it. According to the regulations of the Outline of National Construction, there are events that should be handled from the military administration period, to the tutelage period, to the constitutional period. The delay of each period depends on the completion of the events that should be handled. At the same time, in Premier's other posthumous teachings, there are also rough instructions on how many years each period needs. Since the successful Northern Expedition, due to internal and external troubles, the events that should be handled are not only unfinishable in the period of tutelage, but also still needed in the period of military administration. And in terms of marching by month, ten years have already been added to such a serious national crisis. Saving the country and seeking survival are the common desires of the people, and the same principle. We cannot delay the years because the events that should be handled have not been completed. Therefore, the Fifth National Congress resolved to convene the National Assembly last year, and the draft constitution was also formulated at the same time. Later, it was postponed due to events. The Third Plenary Session resolved to convene the National Assembly within this year and stipulated the powers of this National Assembly, which are to formulate the constitution and determine the date of implementation of the constitution. These have already been decided. As for the various issues before and after the convening of the National Assembly, to give an example, the powers of this National Assembly. Is the current formulation of the constitution only to decide or reject the entire draft constitution submitted by the government, or is it to revise or supplement the various articles in the draft constitution? This is a very important issue. To give another example, after the constitution is formulated, how should the date of its implementation be decided? Should it be implemented immediately after it is formulated, or should there be a transition period before it is implemented after it is formulated? Or should a certain part of it be implemented first, while other parts are still left to be waited for? It is also a very important issue. There are other issues that cannot be listed one by one. We are extremely willing to be taught by you if you give high opinions on such issues. There is also an important political matter that all of you gentlemen must also be concerned about. We have heard that some people have said that Article 1 of the draft constitution stipulates that "the Republic of China is a Republic of the Three Principles of the People," then the provision of Article 16 "People have freedom of assembly and association" is useless, because assembly and association must include political nature. If assembly and association are marked as the Republic of the Three Principles of the People, then all assemblies and associations of a political nature that have different opinions on the Three Principles of the People will not be able to exist, then the so-called freedom of assembly and association will not become empty words? We would like to answer this question in two parts. First, the right to formulate the constitution and determine the date of its implementation belongs to this National Assembly. Therefore, everyone has the freedom to conduct research on the draft constitution, directly or indirectly, to reflect it in the National Assembly. We would like to quietly listen to your high opinions on this. Second, according to our personal views, after the constitution is implemented in the future, what is the extent of the freedom of assembly and association of a political nature, it is impossible to predict at this time. But as far as the current national revolution is concerned, since the Three Principles of the People are the purpose of building the Republic of China, then it is natural and necessary in fact to take this avenue, pass this ladder, and reach the purpose of completing the national revolution, because this is a matter of revolutionary responsibility, not a matter of power consumption. Otherwise, the hope of building the country cannot be realized. During the national revolution, every comrade in this party, every time they think of the Three Principles of the People advocated by the Premier that have not yet been realized, every time they think of the countless comrades who have sacrificed for the sake of seeking the realization of the Three Principles of the People for ten years, and the unfinished work they have left behind, only need to be even more energetic and strive to achieve the end. As for the people of the whole country outside this party, those who have the same belief in the Three Principles of the People, they must also hope for the realization of the Three Principles of the People for the sake of saving the country and revitalizing the nation, and will not hesitate to do their best. Even those who have doubts and objections to the Three Principles of the People will also feel that at the time when the national revolution is underway, what is most important is the unity of the whole country. If the will and actions cannot be unified, then they will be fragmented, causing internal divisions and disasters, and the resistance to the outside world will also be weakened. Not only will it be hopeless to build a modern country, but the existence of the country and nation will not be guaranteed. Therefore, even if they have doubts and objections to the Three Principles of the People, they will definitely not be willing to destroy them, and they cannot but assist them. This is like the Revolution of 1911, even though there were many doubts about the nominal republic, they could not bear to destroy it and sincerely maintained it. How much more now that the national revolution is underway, what is to be built is a republic of the Three Principles of the People with both name and reality. The above is a little bit of our opinion, and we are also very willing to hear what you have to say. The political content is complex and myriad, but now we can only introduce one or two important issues. If your discussions involve and inquire about other issues, we are also extremely willing to be taught. There are also senior officials who hold important positions in government agencies. They are all present and can be supplemented and explained at any time when you ask questions." (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Current Commentary

### The Lugouqiao Incident Cannot Be Considered a Local Incident

—Blowing

According to reports in the past two days, on the one hand, Japan has mobilized large numbers of naval, land, and air forces, while on the other hand, the atmosphere of peace is very strong. This clearly shows their intention to use force to pressure our country and achieve their aggressive ambitions. The unfolding of this incident has long exposed the underlying emotions of the Japanese side.  As of now, it is difficult to predict the extent of the friction in the negotiations between the two sides. However, there is one point that our central authorities and local authorities should pay close attention to.

Yesterday's report stated that Kōzuki visited Song Zheyuan yesterday and proposed conditions for resolving the situation. Song sent Zhang Zizhong and others to negotiate with Japanese representatives. The peaceful situation seems to have taken shape. Judging from this situation, Japan wants to avoid negotiating with the central government and negotiate directly with Song Zheyuan. This is their predetermined plan. Because if this matter is regarded as a local incident, its seriousness can be reduced in name. If the situation does not expand, the goal is easier to achieve. In the Japanese side, it is a win-win situation. Therefore, Kawagoe's return to office did not include meetings with important authorities in our country, but instead went to Qingdao and other places to inspect. Their entire plan has long been calculated.

Therefore, some say that Japan is preparing for a major war on the one hand, and advocating peace on the other, is actually a delaying tactic. This kind of observation is still superficial. In fact, it is nothing more than intimidating the authorities in North China to make them succumb. This is already obvious. However, the land in North China is entirely the land of our Republic of China. The officials in North China are all officials appointed by our central government. Therefore, the authorities in North China have a responsibility to defend the territory and a responsibility to protect and govern the people. Apart from this, without the order of the central government, they have absolutely no right to conclude any diplomatic agreements. Assuming that such an agreement exists unfortunately, the central government should absolutely deny it.

Now Japan avoids negotiating with the central government and negotiates directly with Song Zheyuan. The object of the negotiation is completely wrong. Moreover, the initiation of the Lugouqiao Incident this time is clearly an organized and planned act by the Japanese side. They used the pretext of missing soldiers. Therefore, our central government has lodged a serious protest. The Japanese side ignored it. Now the Japanese side is putting forward conditions for resolving the situation, reportedly as many as five.  The content of these conditions can be known to be extremely unreasonable without even asking. We don't need to discuss them. However, no matter what, I expect that the central government and local authorities will definitely not accept these unreasonable demands carelessly.

Japan's current continental invasion policy is like this: Instead of swallowing it whole, it nibbles away at it like a silkworm. They call it a local incident, but in fact, they gradually occupy it. They avoid severe condemnation from various countries and easily achieve their goals. Their plan is indeed very cruel and insidious. May I ask how many places are there in our country? How much has been divided and trampled by Japan? I don't know how many more places there are for the Japanese to use as an excuse. May I also ask, what will be left of the central government once the local areas are gone?

Therefore, the so-called local incident is, in my opinion, an absolutely unacceptable term, and a term that should be corrected urgently. Moreover, at a time when our country is unified, the emergence of this unfortunate fact is extremely regrettable. What is different is that yesterday's report stated that Song Zheyuan declined donations from all parties to comfort the troops, saying, "This incident is only a local conflict, and the casualties are also small." This kind of rejection of donations from all parties to comfort the troops with patriotic enthusiasm, and the issuance of a lightly-toned argument, inevitably arouses suspicion among the people. On the other hand, he appointed Zhang Zizhong and others to negotiate with Japanese representatives. Whether this kind of appointed representative and the negotiated incident are subject to the intention of the central government, or whether it is Song Zheyuan's independent action, it is still impossible to find out the truth at this time.

However, Song, from a historical perspective, was originally a patriotic general and a loyal and courageous general with a strong anti-Japanese enthusiasm. At this time when the country's survival is at stake, actions that confuse the system of governance are not trivial. Song should understand his own position and the foundation of the overall situation's safety. I don't think he would be so vague. Our central government should also instruct the local authorities and encourage them with great righteousness, so that they can serve on the battlefield and be loyal to the country. Even the last drop of blood should be spilled within the territory they are responsible for defending. Assuming that there is indeed any behavior that violates our country's system of governance and signs any agreement with the Japanese side, our government should absolutely deny it and make effective corrections.

### Cheng Tianfang Issues Declaration

Resist Infringement of Sovereignty

[Berlin] Dr. Cheng Tianfang, the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, issued the following important statement today regarding the North China affairs: "According to the latest news from Tokyo, the Japanese government is willing to seek a peaceful solution to the North China incident. Although people in Chinese political circles believe that Japan's willingness to negotiate is nothing more than a delaying tactic, the government has repeatedly stated that it is willing to handle this issue peacefully.  Local ceasefire agreements cannot be considered valid unless they are recognized by the central government. China has firmly decided to resist any destruction of its territory or sovereignty to the end." (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 15th)

### Russian and French Newspapers Comment on Sino-Japanese Disputes

The Power of Peace-Loving Forces is Far Superior to Belligerent Countries

[Moscow] The Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, recently commented on the Sino-Japanese dispute and criticized Japan's open military action in North China, stating: "The Chinese nation has already risen up to resist the invaders, and should not allow the integrity of Chinese territory to be harmed." The conclusion also stated that the power of peace-loving countries is far superior to belligerent countries. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 16th)

[Paris] Various newspapers from the left and right wings here continue to comment on the Sino-Japanese dispute, and have issued fair opinions. The New Era newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party stated, "The situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the hope for a peaceful resolution has weakened as Japanese troops continue to advance towards the Pingjin area." The Party's 事業報 also stated, "Japan's goal is to conquer China, which China knows very well. Japan's invasion of North China is the prelude to a major war against Soviet Russia. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States should do everything in their power to prevent the situation from escalating. This is the obligation and the right of these countries."

### British Compromise Plan Unanimously Accepted by All Representatives

Non-Intervention Opens Deadlock in Spanish Civil War; Subcommittee Meeting to Review Next Tuesday

[London] At today's meeting of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish conflict, the UK's proposal was unanimously accepted by all countries as the basis for discussion, and it was decided to convene a subcommittee on the 20th to review it. At that time, each country will express its views. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 16th)

[London] The Adjustment Committee for the Non-Intervention in the Spanish civil war held a plenary meeting at 11:00 this morning. Chairman Sir Plymouth, the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, submitted the compromise plan proposed by the British government for discussion. German representative Ribbentrop immediately expressed his opinion, saying that it could be used as a basis for discussion, but certain details, especially the order of implementation, should be revised. This matter could be discussed by appointing a subcommittee. Subsequently, representatives from Italy, Poland, Norway, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Yugoslavia, and the Irish Free State spoke one after another, all accepting the British plan as a basis for discussion. Among them, the Polish representative also proposed the right to make supplementary comments on the issue of withdrawing foreign volunteers. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 16th)

[London] The Adjustment Committee held a meeting this morning. The Italian representative, the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi, expressed his appreciation for the British government's efforts to complete the task, and said that the two suggestions regarding the cancellation of the Western Sea Surveillance Plan would expand the scope of the Spanish civil war non-intervention issue and include the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, the neutrality of each country, and the strengthening of the non-intervention policy. This is exactly the same as the Italian and German plans previously proposed to expand the scope of the non-intervention issue. As far as recognizing both parties involved in the Spanish civil war as belligerent groups is concerned, it is sufficient to limit the Spanish civil war from expanding. It is hoped that countries other than the member states of the Adjustment Committee, especially countries in South America, can also participate in the work of this committee, and that European countries can discuss the compromise plan proposed by the United Kingdom in a spirit of compromise and cooperation. "In Italy, the British compromise plan should be accepted in this spirit as the basis for discussion." Finally, Grandi also proposed that this compromise plan be submitted to the subcommittee for discussion, saying that the Italian government is willing to provide all kinds of suggestions with the utmost sincerity to facilitate the work of the subcommittee.

### British House of Commons Debates Policy on Spain

Eden Defends New Proposals, Explains Hardships to Avoid War

[London] At today's meeting of the House of Commons, opposition leader Attlee strongly criticized the British government's plan to fill the current gaps in the monitoring system for non-intervention in the Spanish war. He asked Foreign Secretary Eden to cancel the recognition of National Army leader General Franco as a belligerent group until volunteers have completely withdrawn from Spain and it has been proven whether Franco has the support of most of the Spanish people. In his reply, the Foreign Secretary explained that the British government had been entrusted internationally to seek a compromise to resolve the current dispute. The new suggestions put forward cannot be changed after consideration by the Non-Intervention Committee. The Foreign Secretary also said that the new suggestions aim to promote international appeasement, and he believed that the House of Commons would not want to harm this appeasement in advance. Attlee expressed dissatisfaction with the Foreign Secretary's reply, and said that the government's suggestion to the Non-Intervention Committee was intended to give Franco the rights of a belligerent group, and there was no practical provision for completely ending foreign intervention in the Spanish war. Therefore, he moved that the House of Commons should immediately debate the government's intentions. Then, Speaker Fitzroy asked the House of Commons whether it supported Attlee. The Labour Party members stood up to express their support. Therefore, the Speaker allowed Attlee to continue speaking. Attlee then began to debate, saying that the government's suggestions were unfair, hasty, and dangerous, and would not be effective for the expected purpose. What the Foreign Secretary is now doing is to reconcile irreconcilable aspects, and the result is to submit to the demands of the fascist countries. These countries only want to use non-intervention as a smokescreen for their intervention. The new suggestion should not be considered until all foreign troops have completely withdrawn from Spain. He believed that the government's suggestion was gradually deviating from the standards of international law, especially the recognition of belligerent group rights. The Foreign Secretary replied, "The governments of Europe all know that if non-intervention fails, the danger of a European war will greatly increase. If we cannot avoid this difficult situation, then there is no other way. But the countries of Europe do not want to approach the cliff. If the UK's suggestion is accepted by the Non-Intervention Committee, then this proposal can be a way to keep non-intervention effective and limit the spread of war. Otherwise, Europe will fall into a major crisis era. The government knows that Europe does not want this. The reason why Europe has entrusted this work to the UK is because of this. The UK will hand over this task in a fair and quick way tomorrow and listen to Europe's decision. The government does not want to admit that war is inevitable. Asking for a delay in the war may not be able to save the war. Please use this concept to judge the government's policy on the Spanish war." (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 16th)

[London] The House of Commons began debating the issue of recognizing the rights of belligerent groups on both sides of the Spanish Civil War today. Opposition Labour Party leader Leader Adeley criticized the British government's non-intervention plan, calling it unfair, inappropriate, and dangerous. He said that the government dared not offend General Franco in every way, and now it wants to give him the rights of a belligerent group, which is nothing more than trying to please Hitler and Mussolini. However, "as far as I can see, Mussolini will not stop until the Mediterranean becomes an Italian lake." At this point, Foreign Secretary Eden immediately replied, "The Labour Party's attitude this time is really unusual. It is not only harmful to the Labour Party itself, but also harmful to world peace. At a time when Europe is in crisis, the government is trying to cooperate with other countries, but the Labour Party is doing its best to hinder it." At that time, there was a great uproar on the Labour Party benches, and they all accused the government of failing to protect British merchant ships. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 15th)

### Construction of Defense Works Around Gibraltar

German-Made Gun Emplacements Used; Almost a Complete Encirclement

[London] The "Daily Herald's" correspondent in British Gibraltar recently reported that "Spanish Nationalist-controlled territory around Gibraltar has recently had defense works constructed under the supervision of German experts, forming an encirclement. The gun emplacements used are mostly German-made and were transported to their destination by the German pocket battleship 'Deutschland' and the 'Admiral Scheer' on February 22nd and March 20th of this year, respectively. Two batteries have been placed in the Bay of Algeciras, half a mile from Algeciras, one of which is a 16-inch caliber battery and the other a 14-inch caliber battery. A 10-inch battery has also been placed seven miles from Algeciras, at Mount Datbe Reus. A 16-inch battery and multiple anti-aircraft guns have been placed on a nearby mountain peak to support it. In addition, four mountain artillery batteries have been placed behind the Bay of Algeciras, and various defense works have been built between Bondagala and Tarifa. Even behind Gibraltar, in San Roque, there are five artillery batteries to attack its rear," the report stated. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas dispatch)

### Two Japanese Divisions Continuously Arriving in Beiping and Tianjin

Beining Railway Main Line Completely Occupied; Key Figures on Both Sides Still Negotiating Peace

Tianjin correspondent: In recent days, large numbers of enemy troops have been transported here. Military trains are incessantly traveling between Korea, Manchuria, Tianjin, and Yushu. Airplanes cover the sky, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. However, peace negotiations are also underway between the two sides. The following is a comprehensive report from various sources:

Newly Arrived Japanese Troops

Since the 12th, the Japanese army has been using the Beining Railway, forcing the use of Korean and Manchurian railway cars to transport the Kawaguchi unit of the 10th Division stationed in Korea to Tianjin. In addition to those transferred from the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), drivers and accompanying personnel also include a railway unit. Besides the military cars, a train of armored cars, a train of searchlight armored cars, a train of wireless armored cars, and a train of materials such as railway sleepers and rails were also sent to immediately repair any railway obstructions. As of 1:00 AM on the 14th, a total of 15 military trains had arrived in Tianjin, transporting approximately 4,600 infantry and artillery soldiers. The division has a wartime establishment of about 14,000 men, so only about one-third had arrived in Tianjin by the morning of the 14th. The rest were still in transit and are expected to complete transportation by the 15th. The unit under Lieutenant General Seishiro Itagaki of the 5th Division had been shipped by seven military vessels three days ago and was scheduled to land at Shanhaiguan, Nanhaibin, Qinhuangdao, and Tanggu on the morning of the 15th, and then transported to Beiping and Tianjin by the SMR. A part of the Sato Division of the Kwantung Army entered through Gubeikou starting on the 12th and advanced towards the suburbs of Beiping. In addition, another division is preparing to mobilize, seemingly with the aim of reinforcing the force. By the evening of the 15th, the Japanese forces were expected to be mostly assembled. It is generally speculated that a large-scale offensive is about to begin, and both Beiping and Tianjin will suffer. As for the air forces of Kwantung and Korea, they have been continuously flying into Tianjin since the 11th and landing at Li Mingzhuang and Bali Tai airfields. As of the 14th, there were 32 aircraft of four types: bombing, combat, transport, and reconnaissance. Most of the Hui Tung Aircraft, jointly operated by China and Japan, have been converted into reconnaissance planes.

Itagaki Delays Arrival

Seishiro Itagaki, the former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army and current commander of the Japanese 5th Division, was originally scheduled to fly directly to Tianjin from Tokyo around 5:00 PM on the 14th to meet with Kiyoshi Katsuki, the new commander of the Japanese forces stationed in Tianjin. After the 5th Division arrives, it will be stationed around Beiping. Lieutenant General Kawaguchi, commander of the 10th Division, was also scheduled to come to Tianjin from Seoul, Korea, on the afternoon of the 14th. After the two division commanders arrive, they will hold a military conference with Katsuki to determine the military action plan. Itagaki is a well-known "China expert" and is known to be extremely fierce. He is also one of the main players in the September 18th Incident. He is currently a leader of the young officers faction and has always advocated the so-called "expansion of eastern Hebei" and the so-called "specialization of North China." Therefore, the traitors in eastern Hebei were happy to hear that Itagaki was leading troops to invade. However, as peace negotiations progressed between China and Japan, his arrival was temporarily delayed. Kawaguchi still arrived in Tianjin on time and visited Katsuki to discuss military affairs.

Transportation Occupied

Starting on the 12th, the Korean Japanese army entered the customs. The Beining Railway Bureau refused to allocate cars. The Japanese side then used Korean and Manchurian railway cars for transportation. Wherever the military trains passed, they ordered several members of the SMR railway unit and the puppet state border police who came with the train to get off and stay in the station houses along the way to monitor the actions of the railway staff and the dispatch of vehicles. Employees at each station were only allowed to communicate by long-distance telephone for normal train operations, and no other communication was allowed. The same was true for Tianjin East Station and the main station. When military trains arrived at each station on that day, Chinese people were forbidden to peek from the side, and railway staff who did not have necessary duties were also driven out of the station. On the 14th, troops were also stationed in the military transport section and vehicle dispatch office of the Beining Railway Bureau to prevent the railway from allocating vehicles to transport our troops. Therefore, the main line of the Beining Railway has been completely occupied by the Japanese army. At Fengtai Station, only a few railway employees were allowed to stay and work, and the rest were driven out. Even the school buildings of the Rotary School were occupied by them. However, the Japanese military headquarters in Tianjin issued a statement on the 12th, falsely claiming that because the Beining Railway did not allocate cars to transport troops, they had no choice but to transfer SMR vehicles into the customs to provide military transport and that they were not forcibly occupying the Beining Railway or obstructing the rights of various countries under the Boxer Protocol. This is deliberately to cover up and prevent the powers from interfering.

Peace Negotiations

Regarding peace negotiations, on the night of the 13th, key figures of the Hebei and Chahar governments in Beiping and Tianjin made every effort to negotiate with the other side. Those working hard in Beiping were Qin Dechun, Qi Xieyuan, Zhang Yunrong, and others. Those working hard in Tianjin were Chen Juesheng, Deng Zexi, Liu Jialuan, and others. Those responsible for negotiations on the other side were Hashimoto, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Military Headquarters in Tianjin, and Wachi, Chief of the Second Section. Each exhausted their efforts, traveling back and forth all night, and achieved an outline. The preliminary issue was that the Japanese side should stop sending troops and those who had come should withdraw from the country within a short period of time. Those who had not arrived should be repatriated. The opposing troops at Lugouqiao, Yongdingmen, and Daizicun should send supervisors to monitor their withdrawal or withdraw to a considerable distance to avoid prolonged opportunities for friction and escalating the situation. The remaining matters should be discussed in detail. The Japanese side agreed to this. Starting on the 14th, Zhang Lingyun and others, regimental commanders of the 29th Army, and Sakurai and Nakajima, Japanese advisors to the Hebei and Chahar Political Affairs Committee, Terapira, deputy chief of the Beiping Special Service Agency, and Kada, the captain of the Japanese army in Fengtai, jointly supervised. Both sides withdrew their troops to a distance of several thousand meters. Around noon, the Japanese troops in Daizicun, outside Yongdingmen, and outside Guangqumen gradually withdrew and returned to Tongzhou and Fengtai to be stationed. By the evening, only more than 200 Japanese troops had not withdrawn outside the Han River railway bridge culvert, the east gate of Wanping County. The atmosphere in Beiping improved as a result. At noon on the 14th, Qi Xieyuan and Zhang Yunrong came to Tianjin first to report the situation in Beiping to Song Zheyuan. At 2:30 PM, Zhang Zizhong also returned to Tianjin from Beiping by special train. After 10:00 PM, Song Zheyuan specifically convened key figures from the 29th Army and Hebei and Chahar in the Jinde Society on 19th Road in the British Concession for a secret meeting. Zhang Zizhong, Qi Xieyuan, Chen Juesheng, Liu Jialuan, Deng Zexi, and others participated. It was reported that they were specifically discussing and deciding on a concrete way to respond to the Japanese demands. After a long discussion, they dispersed and immediately sent Zhang Zizhong and Chen Juesheng to visit Hashimoto to express their views. Because the opinions of both sides were closer, the situation in Beiping and Tianjin was relatively peaceful until 3:00 AM on the 15th.

Kawagoe Arrives in Tianjin

Japanese Ambassador to China Shigeru Kawagoe, according to his scheduled itinerary, arrived in Tianjin by China Airlines plane at 10:55 AM on the 14th with secretary Hoshida and translator Shimizu and stayed at the Tokiwa Inn in the Japanese Concession. At 2:00 PM, he went to Zhang Yuan with the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Shiro Torikane, to pay a visit to Kiyoshi Katsuki and exchange opinions. He also attended a meeting convened by Katsuki of Japanese army, navy, and overseas executives in North China. Those present on the army side were Hashimoto, Wachi, Oki, Ikeda, and Tsukada. Those present on the navy side were military attachés Kobetto and Kubota stationed in Beiping and Tianjin. Those present on the diplomatic side were Kawagoe, Horiuchi, Tianjin consul An'iichi Kishigami, Hagiwara, Ooe, and Murakami. They dispersed around 3:00 PM. After the meeting, Kawagoe went to the Japanese Consul General's residence in the British Concession to hear Horiuchi's report on the general situation in North China. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Horiuchi and others. He will stay in Tianjin for several days to observe the diplomatic situation before going to Beiping. His meeting with Song Zheyuan has not yet been scheduled. Song is unwilling to meet with Kawagoe at this time, and Kawagoe is inconvenient to visit before the military issues are resolved. However, side-channel intentions were revealed or conveyed by those close to both sides on a daily basis.

A False Alarm in Tianjin

Around 8:00 PM on the 14th, the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, consisting of more than 1,500 infantry soldiers, 24 artillery pieces, 45 machine guns, 5 military trucks of various sizes, and more than 30 cavalrymen, set off from the Haiguang Temple Japanese military barracks, passed through Asahi Street in the Japanese Concession, exited Dongma Road, and headed towards Huangwei Road in Hebei and the Fengtai area. When the soldiers were passing through Dongma Road, they stopped in the street to rest and set up guns. Many citizens watched, and the Japanese soldiers shouted loudly. The ignorant masses ran away, causing everyone to follow suit. For a time, the order of Dongma Road, Dajing Road in Hebei, and Dama Road in Special Zone Two was disrupted. The old and the young all fled in panic, traffic was blocked, and streetcars stopped. The Municipal Police Bureau immediately ordered all bureaus to turn off the lights and be vigilant. Security teams were all raised to the rooftops, lying prone to wait for the enemy. Around 9:00 PM, the Japanese soldiers finished resting and went north without taking any action. People's hearts began to settle, and traffic resumed. After 11:00 PM, all the security teams were dispatched, paying particular attention to the Sino-Japanese border area in the south city to prevent small bandits from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. However, the Japanese Concession in Tianjin has been under special alert since the 12th. Oe, the consul and police chief, supervised the veteran soldiers, volunteer corps, and national defense women's association in the concession to form special guard teams to be responsible for protecting expatriates and providing relief. Their intention to strengthen their defenses is especially peculiar but their efforts are equal.

Parting Tears

At 4:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, approximately 2,000 Japanese expatriate veteran soldiers and Japanese expatriate volunteers in Tianjin set off for Fengtai with the intention of providing reinforcements. As they passed through Dongma Road and headed towards Dajie Road in Hebei, women saw them off as they left the Japanese Concession at the southeastern corner of the Sino-Japanese border. At the time of parting, they wept and could not look up. The so-called "warriors" also all looked dejected and lost. This is enough to see that human beings fear the horrors of war. The same is true at home and abroad. In addition, the 37th Division under Feng Zhi'an and the 38th Division under Zhang Zizhong of the 29th Army fought the hardest in this battle. The 38th Division under Zhang Zizhong did not participate. Feng's unit was forced to withdraw from Fengtai last year, and there was nowhere to vent their grievances. Now that they have been unduly oppressed by the Japanese side, the soldiers naturally have old and new hatreds surging in their hearts. Their actions to kill the enemy did not wait for the orders of their superiors and they bravely went forward. When the broadsword teams fought at night, they did not care about the enemy's machine gun fire, rolled forward in front of the enemy, jumped up and swung their swords. Many of those who were beheaded and dismembered by the swordsmen were beheaded and dismembered. The wounded enemy soldiers who did not die all wailed miserably, making their comrades frightened and battle-weary. Since the 13th, most of the Japanese soldiers on the front line have had the intention of avoiding battle. In each conflict, the number of deaths has been greater than that of the 29th Army. Therefore, they have mostly switched to shelling from a distance to avoid the charge of the broadsword teams. The 138 beds in the Japanese military hospital in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin have been full since the 11th. Among them, there are more than 20 lower-ranking officers with missing limbs. After the 12th, the Japanese officers' club on Akashi Street and the Japanese military police dormitory on Frong Street were all used and converted into temporary field hospitals. But by the morning of the 13th, they were full again. The number of Japanese soldiers killed or wounded is estimated to be at least 400. (4:00 AM on the 15th)

Strange Ships Fire at Riverbank

According to information from the Taicang Police Bureau, the three strange ships discovered between Yanglinkou and Liuhoukou were only identified as gray on the morning of the 15th, and the flag was still unclear. Around 10:00 AM, the ships used machine guns to strafe the coast, firing very densely. Residents could hear it clearly. The firing stopped after about 15 minutes. Later, because the ships were still 30 to 40 miles from the shore, the bullets all landed in the river. The coast was unharmed. They left around 11:00 AM. As evening approached at 5:00 PM, two ships were vaguely seen sailing upstream, but they did not take any action or dock.

Li Genyuan Encourages Song via Telegram

Li Genyuan recently sent a telegram to Song Zheyuan, which read: "To Chairman Mingxuan Song of the Beiping Hebei Chahar Political Affairs Committee and all generals of the 29th Army: The eastern barbarians are swarming and the whole country is united in hatred. You are in charge of the frontier and uphold justice in the spirit of the Spring and Autumn Annals, shining brightly today. If Taiyan has a spirit, he will surely smile. The awarding of honors will be here again. It is hoped that you will persevere to the end, train your soldiers and drive away the ugly invaders, returning our rivers and mountains. My heart follows the telegram. I am utterly sincere. I, Li Genyuan, bow to you."

### Wuxi

Wheat Price Breaks the Ten Yuan Mark

Due to the low yield and brisk sales of wheat in Wuxi this year, the market price has risen. Recently, the goods arriving at each market have become even scarcer, while various flour mills have a strong appetite for purchases. Generally, merchants send staff to the countryside to buy from house to house for profit. On the 15th, the market price broke the ten yuan mark. Judging from the current situation in North China, there is still the possibility of continued price increases in the future. In addition, the market price of flour has also increased accordingly. Green Mountain Deer and Green Battleship brands cost four yuan, one jiao, and two fen per bag. The market situation for rice has also risen by about two jiao per day. However, the price of cotton yarn in Wuxi has fallen by one or two yuan per piece due to the influence of the Shanghai market.

### Hangzhou

Fishery and Salt Prices Agreed Upon in Wenzhou

Since the fishery and salt of the coastal counties of Zhejiang Province were approved to be exempted from discoloration, the Fishery Management Committee formulated measures for implementation and management. The transportation of fishery and salt in Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou was taken over by officials. The price of fishery and salt was jointly negotiated by representatives from all walks of life. The price of fishery and salt in Wenzhou has now been agreed upon, with the price of revenue set at 140 catties per yuan and the price of sales set at 55 catties per yuan. Because the salt factories in Ningbo and Taizhou have not yet been completed, the price of fishery and salt in those areas will not be negotiated until two weeks later.

### Ningbo

Donation to慰勞 the Frontline Soldiers

The Ningbo County Lawyers Association, deeply admiring the frontline soldiers who are bravely defending the country and esteemed by the entire nation, resolved at its council meeting on the 14th to send a telegram of condolence and, in addition, to immediately collect one hundred yuan in national currency to be remitted to the front. Furthermore, letters were sent to various organizations in this port to unanimously raise funds and donate them to the soldiers as a gesture of support.

### Xu Shiying Returns to His Post Despite Illness, Boards Ship Last Night and Departs East This Morning

Special Vessel Crosses the Huangpu River, Enthusiastic Farewell from All Sides. Earnest Speech at the Public Organization Tea Party, Hoping for Peace Based on Righteous Diplomacy.

Xu Shiying, the ambassador to Japan, returned to his post despite his illness. He boarded the "President Cleveland" of the Dala Company at 10 PM last night and set sail eastward at 2 AM this morning. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, local associations and other public organizations held a tea party to bid him farewell. Xu Shiying delivered an earnest speech on the spot. Before his departure last night, he also released a statement to the press. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Organization Tea Party

The public organizations in this city, initiated by the Local Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, held a grand tea party yesterday at 5 PM at the Pudong Native Place Association on Edward Road to bid farewell to Xu Shiying. The participating organizations included: representative of Commander Yang of the Garrison Command, National Products Manufacturers Association, Taxpaying Chinese Association, Money Trade Association, Journalists Association, Chaozhou Native Place Association, Fenghua Native Place Association, National Medicine Association, Booksellers Association, World Bookstore, Guangdong Native Place Association, Commercial Press, China Bookstore, Physicians Association, Accountants Association, Film Production Industry Association, National Goods Preservation Association, New Medicine Industry Association, Shanghai Charity Federation, China Business Society, Global Student Association, various district branches of the Special District, Nantong Native Place Association, Yuyao Native Place Association, Shangyu Native Place Association, Red Swastika Society, Sichuan Native Place Association, Shexian Native Place Association, various universities, various newspapers, Ningbo Native Place Association, Pudong Native Place Association, Qidou Native Place Association, Anhui Native Place Association, Wuyuan Native Place Association, General Labor Union, Chinese Vocational Education Society, General Federation of Industry, Postal Workers Union, Guanghua University, Social Bureau, National Goods Movement Association, Hui Ning Native Place Association, National Federation of Commerce, Citizens Federation, Cotton Industry Control Association, Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Association, China Vocational School, China General Federation of Industry, Wuxi Native Place Association, National Goods Production and Sales Association, Hebei Native Place Association, Gauze Exchange, Wing On Company, Bankers Association, Municipal Fishermen's Association, National Goods Factories Federation, Shipping Industry Association.

Mr. Wang's Speech

More than 600 people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Feng Shaoshan, Xu Jikui, Wen Lanting, Qin Runqing, He Dekui, Guo Shun, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Boyuan, Qu Wenliu, Yang Hu, (Wang Zhinan representing), Wang Yiting, Jin Runxiang, Hu Xiyuan, Ren Jinping, Xie Jiaqian, Zhao Jinshan, Wu Yunqi, Xie Zhongfu, Yang Weiyu, Zhu Shaoping, Fang Jiaobo, Kui Yanfang, Dai Liu, Wang Zhisheng, Feng Xunchen, and others. The atmosphere was extraordinarily warm. Wang Xiaolai chaired the event and delivered a farewell speech, saying, "Today, various organizations in Shanghai have prepared tea and snacks and are holding a meeting to bid farewell to Ambassador Xu. At this time of tense situation, Xu Jinglao resolutely returns to his post despite his illness, negotiating and working hard for the country. This is how we should face the national crisis together. This spirit is worthy of our admiration. People often 'retreat when they know it is difficult,' but now it should be changed to 'advance when they know it is difficult,' and follow the spirit of Ambassador Xu. Ambassador Xu's name is Jingren, and the two characters 'Jingren' can just describe Ambassador Xu's personality. Quietness controls movement, and benevolence and righteousness are in his heart. We have full of enthusiasm, and it is difficult to express everything in detail. I think Jinglao can also understand it. Jinglao's trip abroad to negotiate everything will definitely be as we hope. Our entire nation will unanimously be Jinglao's backing," and so on.

Mr. Xu's Speech

Xu Shiying immediately gave a speech, saying: "Today, all the leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai held a meeting to bid farewell to me as I am about to return to my post as the ambassador to Japan. I am truly undeserving of such great kindness and consideration. However, at this time of serious situation, I have such an opportunity to say goodbye to you all and seek advice on everything. In addition to feeling deeply ashamed, I also feel deeply grateful. Recalling when I returned to China in early March, I expressed to all sectors that I have always held the belief that the purpose of diplomacy should be justice. To achieve the success of justice, one must be sincere. Moreover, righteous diplomacy should be in an active position. However, because I am not familiar with the language of the host country, I am afraid that I cannot exert the function of the nation's eyes and ears if I insisted on acting as a blind person who sees and a mute person who speaks. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the government can select diplomatic specialists to continue this arduous task. I have sincerely resigned to President Jiang and Minister Wang, but they have not approved it. It is my duty, and I dare not stay in the country for long. I originally planned to prepare early and return to my post in early May. Suddenly, on April 13th, I suffered from acute suppurative otitis media, which was very dangerous. I was bedridden for 53 days before I barely recovered. With my old and weak body, suffering from this serious illness, it is difficult for my spirit to recover immediately. Personal health is, of course, a small matter, and I am not a person who is afraid of difficulties and seeks safety and comfort. What I fear is being overwhelmed by complex affairs, and therefore delaying public affairs, then the guilt is really deep. I again resigned to the government repeatedly, but the President and Minister still consoled and encouraged me, and I was not approved until the 7th of this month. The Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and the soldiers guarding the territory bravely defended the country. The situation was tense, day by day. The position of envoy must not be left vacant like this any longer. Therefore, the center is even more anxious. Since the government firmly refuses to resign, I will return again despite my illness. I can briefly report to you the process of resigning and not being approved after returning to the country this time. Former Japanese Foreign Minister Arita often said that the term war should not be mentioned by diplomatic personnel. This is, of course, the reason. The use of peace should be based on justice and sincerity as a creed. Duke Konoe Fumimaro, bearing the heavy hopes of the entire Japanese nation, declared as soon as he was ordered to form a cabinet that he would advocate international justice externally. Foreign Minister Hirota has repeatedly declared to the world that he would not invade or threaten China. Now the situation in Tianjin and Hebei has reached an extreme point. Although the Japanese authorities have expressed their determination not to expand, I sincerely hope that both Cabinets Konoe and Hirota can uphold their original aspirations and strive to carry out their consistent duties for the relations between the two countries, for peace in East Asia, and even for the well-being of mankind. Although I am old and ill, I should also uphold my original aspirations and encourage each other, hoping to eliminate the century-old disaster for the two major nations and preserve the vitality of our children and grandchildren. Every country in the world has the right to independent survival, but seeking one's own survival should be based on not harming the survival of others. Otherwise, why would others not rise up to defend their survival? If they defend, but these two major nations do not work hard day and night for the stability of peace in East Asia, so as to increase the well-being of the world's people, then the future will be unimaginable. If wars continue, no matter how many years later, those who sow evil causes will eventually reap evil consequences. I am so old and my body is so ill, so I am throwing myself into this without regard for my own safety. It is precisely because of my responsibilities that my duty to the country is supreme and outweighs everything. Today, all the leaders present are purely based on justice and are coming from natural intuition in their difficult safeguarding actions of the new China. Not losing rights or humiliating the country is the duty we should fulfill today. At the beginning of this year, I deeply felt that this year is the most important juncture in Sino-Japanese relations. If it is not improved, it will inevitably deteriorate. I have expressed this idea to the Japanese government and the public. If the situation is so tense now, if it can be based on justice and with the greatest sincerity, it can still be remedied. If it is allowed to deteriorate, then the responsibility for that also lies in that creation, and they are all fighting to contribute. Their spirit of loving the country and fulfilling their responsibilities has always been relied upon to lead the whole country, and I admire and respect them. Your talents and physical strength are far better than mine. I sincerely hope that you will lead the whole country with your greatest efforts, run together, and under the command of the government and leaders, support the crisis, stabilize the difficulties, and fulfill your highest duty to the country. I am leaving, and I firmly believe that righteous diplomacy is a manifestation of the will and strength of a country's people. I firmly believe that the strength of the concentrated will of our 450 million compatriots is more valuable than the strong armor and sharp weapons of modern chemistry equipment. Therefore, there is no hesitation in this trip. I firmly know that your strong will, and the strong will of the compatriots throughout the country, will be the driving force of my diplomacy, and I can make me not disgrace my mission. I respectfully borrow a cup of tea to bless you all, and mutually wish each other well with all the people of the country."

Moreover, Xu Shiying's close friends Zhu Qinglan, Wang Zhen, Qu Yingguang, Cheng Jingsheng, Huang Qinglan, Xie Jiaqian, and others also held a banquet for Xu Shiying at Gongdelin on Parker Road at 12 PM yesterday to see him off.

Special Vessel Crosses the Huangpu River

The "President Cleveland" was berthed between buoys number 12 and 13 on the Yangshupu River. Xu Shiying boarded Du Yuesheng's specially prepared small boat "Yuebao" at 11 PM last night from the Xinguang Wharf to cross the Huangpu River. Accompanying him were Hu Mai, the third secretary of the embassy, Zhou Yigui, and researcher Cui Wanqiu. As for Huang Bodu, the second secretary of the embassy, and editor Lin Xiaogu, they were assigned to temporarily stay in China to handle unfinished official duties and will take another ship eastward on the 20th. At that time, those who went to the ship to see him off included Wang Shaozhai, representing acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, Wang Zhinan, representing Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Chen Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Qinglan, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Guo Shun, Qin Runqing, Yue Jinshan, Xu Xiuzhi, Chen Bofan, Li Shishen, Zhang Peiyi, and Jioka Noritake, the consul stationed in Shanghai who represented Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru, and Kamitani Kisaburo representing the commercial officer stationed in China, totaling over one hundred people.

Farewell Remarks

Before his departure, Xu Shiying made a speech on the ship saying: "I have reported the circumstances of my hurried return to my post due to my responsibilities at the tea party of local associations and other groups. Now, what I can say can be divided into three points. Firstly, the Sino-Japanese situation a month ago was indeed extremely serious, but diplomatic personnel are committed to peace. I returned to my post with great aspirations, hoping to base on the four words of justice and sincerity, and strive for both parties to eliminate the invisible danger for the current crisis of the two major nations, which will also have infinite benefits for the overall situation in East Asia and the well-being of mankind. Secondly, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe has long been highly anticipated, and Foreign Minister Hirota has held key positions and has always been committed to the overall situation in East Asia and striving to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. I sincerely hope that these two officials will continue to work hard in the field of peace, rein in at the edge of the cliff, reverse the tense situation, and truly and permanently be friendly with the Chinese people. Thirdly, I am old and weak, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to make up for even one ten-thousandth of the situation. However, I always hold the purpose of not losing rights or humiliating the country in my heart, and I will do my best. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will concentrate their will and, under the leadership of the government and leaders, calmly and firmly respond to the changes in the situation. When I went abroad last time, what I said was that what is inside is more important than what is outside, and seeking oneself is better than seeking others, which is a permanent and unchanging principle."

### Strike Dispute at Fuxin Flour Company

Attempting to Rob Police Officers of Their Batons; Tao Yiqing and Others Injured

At around 7 PM yesterday, the workers of the Fuxin Flour Company on Guangfu Road suddenly went on strike, gathering in front of the factory and making demands to the company authorities. At that time, the order was very chaotic. The company was afraid that something might happen, so it immediately telegraphed the Xin Zha Police Station in charge to request maintenance. The police station dispatched a large number of police officers to suppress the situation and persuaded the workers to disperse. Unexpectedly, the workers not only did not comply, but also gathered together to oppose the police. The noise was loud, and with a shout, they wanted to rob the police officers of their batons. Therefore, the police first arrested the workers who were leading the incident and then tried to drive the workers away. As a result, there was a conflict between the two sides on the spot. The heads of foremen Tao Yiqing, workers Xu Fuxing, Shen Jiting, and others were injured by the batons. Afterwards, they were sent to the hospital for treatment. The arrested workers were immediately taken to the police station for interrogation and detention, and an investigation was launched to report to the German authorities for a thorough investigation. The remaining workers have dispersed one after another.

We hope you will continue to fight bravely and win glory for the country. Our associations are willing to be your backing. From the 25 Shanghai-based native place associations in Yang County and others."

Shanghai Youth

The Shanghai Youth United National Salvation League held an emergency meeting yesterday at 2 PM, deciding to send a telegram to all the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army to express condolences and, starting from today, all members of the league are mobilizing to continue to raise donations. The fundraising methods are said to be divided into two categories: fundraising within schools and donations from relatives and friends, with a deadline of one week to complete the fundraising work.

Citizens' Branch

Various district branches of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, including the 7th, 16th, 27th, 30th, 41st, and 43rd districts, telegraphed the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army yesterday, saying, "The Lugouqiao Incident has shocked the whole country. This time, the Japanese army is looking for trouble with us, which is definitely not an isolated incident, but a consistent policy of aggression. The soldiers have made great achievements in defending the country and resisting the enemy. We hope to continue the efforts, painfully annihilate the Japanese invaders, follow in the footsteps of Han Yue, and have your names immortalized, laying the foundation for the country on a solid foundation and seeking the survival of the nation. Our association understands that all members are determined to be your backing. We respectfully send our condolences. I hope you will understand." Furthermore, the executive and supervisory committee members of the Jing'an Temple Road branch originally had a dinner party organization, but now they have decided to change it to a tea party and remit the saved funds to the front. In addition, the 38th District Branch held a meeting yesterday and resolved to notify members to refuse to use counterfeit currency and to nominate Shen Xinhua and Fan Tianmian as representatives to participate in the Association for Assisting Soldiers in Resisting the Enemy.

New Life Movement Letter

The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association sent a special letter to the municipal public organs, requesting all employees to donate one day's salary, to be deducted from the salaries of officials and staff by the organs, and immediately remit it to the frontline soldiers to boost morale. It also notified the New Life Movement Committees to encourage citizens to economize on food and clothing to assist the frontline soldiers defending the country. The letter read, "Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the enemy has mobilized divisions and gradually advanced, and Sima Zhao's intention is obvious. Fortunately, our garrison has vowed to resist to the death, and the enemy has not succeeded. However, this war is a struggle for the entire nation, and its nature is definitely not a local conflict. The gains and losses of North China are related to the survival of the whole country. The frontline soldiers have spared no effort and are willing to sacrifice their lives. How can we, the people in the rear, bear to live in peace and comfort and turn a blind eye? Defending against insults and saving the country is the responsibility of every citizen. Let us make offerings like Xian Gao, follow Bu Shi's example of donating wealth, do our best, and jointly face the national crisis. This is to notify the various New Life Movement Committees in this city to immediately encourage colleagues and citizens to economize on food and clothing and assist the frontline soldiers defending the country, and report the handling situation to the association at any time."

They hoped that the students staying in Shanghai and compatriots from all walks of life would immediately respond. Even if each person donates one copper coin every day, it would be a blessing for our nation and country.

### International Issues Research Association Cables Europe and America to Uphold Justice

The Shanghai-based directors of the International Issues Research Association, including Li Zhaohuan, Dong Xian Guang, He De Kui, Xu Xin Liu, Chen Guang Fu, Dai Zhi Qian, Zou Bing Wen, Liu Hong Sheng, and Secretary-General Dai Bao Liu, concerned about the increasingly serious situation in North China, yesterday cabled various cultural organizations in Europe and America, such as the New York Council on Foreign Relations and the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, requesting them to expose Japanese plots in China and uphold justice. The translated text is as follows: "Our association believes that the crisis in North China is becoming increasingly severe. We are cabling to request that your esteemed council pay close attention. The Lugouqiao Incident, which occurred on August 8th of this month, was entirely caused by the planned provocative actions of the Japanese army stationed in North China. The Japanese army, invoking the Boxer Protocol, arbitrarily conducted nighttime exercises, with the aim of creating incidents as an excuse to seize North China. Although our government is striving for a peaceful resolution, the Japanese army is expanding the situation and the scope of the war. At the same time, they are opposing North China accepting the rule of the central government and demanding the complete withdrawal of the central army. Their ulterior motives are obvious. If allowed to develop to its extreme, it will turn China into a second Manchuria, destroy our national territorial integrity, and tear up the Nine-Power Treaty. The seriousness of the situation can be seen. Now, our government is still adhering to its initial intention of peace and continuing its efforts to seek appropriate solutions. If Japan is unrepentant and intends to split our national territory, then our 470 million people, in order to maintain sovereignty, will have no choice but to bravely resist, even at the cost of the greatest sacrifice. In recent days, reports indicate that the number of Japanese troops near Beiping has been increasing daily, and a large-scale invasion is imminent. The crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, which is alarming. We urge your gentlemen to uphold justice and suggest that your government take effective measures to stop the aggression and prevent war. Not only will peace in the Far East be maintained, but the welfare of the world will also depend on it." It is also reported that the association also telegraphed General Song Zheyuan of the Twenty-Ninth Army and all its soldiers yesterday to express condolences.

### Pang Jingzhou of the Red Cross to Speak on Rescue Issues Today

Since receiving the alert from North China at noon on the 8th, the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society first telegraphed its Beiping branch to inquire about the status of work. Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General of the Shanghai General Headquarters, happened to be going to Lu on the 9th for official business. As the news became increasingly tense en route, he immediately telegraphed the North China Relief Committee from various ports, instructing them on everything. Later, on the 12th, he received a reply stating that the northern surgical medical team for seriously injured personnel had been prepared and had reported to the standing committee of Qin Feng and others, awaiting orders to depart. As for Mr. Pang, he was urgently summoned by telegram from Nanjing and hurriedly descended the mountain on the 15th, heading east. Yesterday morning, he passed through Ning and spent the whole day consulting with the health and military medical departments on various key rescue matters. It was not until 5:00 PM that he took the express train back to Shanghai. It is reported that he will deliver a radio address on rescue issues at a certain radio station today, so that enthusiastic young people will not join blindly.

### Li Guang'an Visited Sun Ke Yesterday to Report on the Situation in Beiping and Tianjin

According to Him, the Future of North China Is Not Optimistic; The Japanese Are Still Continuously Increasing Troops Entering the Pass

All sectors of the city are deeply moved by the brave resistance of the Twenty-Ninth Army. Li Guang'an, the head of the army's office in Shanghai, visited Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and Du Yuesheng, the President of the Shanghai Local Association, yesterday morning to report on the situation in Beiping and Tianjin and the strategies of Song Zheyuan and others in dealing with the incident. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency visited Mr. Ji yesterday morning. According to him, there have been no formal conflicts in the suburbs of Beiping, probably because of the pursuit of peace. However, based on the information received from the north, the future is not optimistic, because the Japanese are now transferring large numbers of troops from the Northeast into the Pass, endlessly, which seems to be a preparation for a major war.

### Detailed Record of Witness Interrogation in the Suspected Case of Manipulation in the Yarn Exchange

Yu Qiaqing Testifies in Court on Relevant Events; Hopes for Thorough Investigation to Reveal Who the Manipulators Are; Court to Summon Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi This Morning

Wu Qiding, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Sheng Shengyi, Director of the Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Taxation Bureau, are suspected of speculation and manipulation in the recent turmoil in the yarn and cloth exchange. The Special First Court has held two hearings to investigate. Song Genshan, the prosecutor in charge of this case, has decided not to confront the suspected persons on the same day in order to ensure that the witnesses testify truthfully. Therefore, the investigation of Wu and Sheng has been scheduled for tomorrow morning. Yesterday, the court specially held a hearing to summon witnesses, including Mu Xiangyue, Director of the Yarn Exchange; Yu Qiaqing, Manager of the Sanbei Shipping Company; Sun Bangrui, Manager of the He Xing Trading Company, broker number 27; Chen Kanghe, accountant; Sun Yufeng, broker number 57; and another broker, Dong Zaisun, a total of six people. However, Mu, Sun, and Sun are still in Lushan and have not returned, so they appointed Shen Sidong and Chen Rentao to appear in court to make statements. Dong Zaisun was ill and appointed lawyer Li Yujun to appear in court. Only Yu Qiaqing, Sun Bangrui, and Chen Kanghe appeared. Wu Qiding's lawyer, Tong Yuwen, Sheng Shengyi's lawyer, Li Zhaofu, and Wang Xiaolai were all in court to observe. At 9:30 AM, Prosecutor Song took his seat in the Fifth Court and first summoned Chen Kanghe to inquire about Sheng's transactions in the yarn exchange. According to Chen's answer, I handled the customer contacts, but others also handled them. Zhuang Zhiji, that is, Zhuang Zhijiu (homophone), is the husband of Sheng's seventh daughter. Bingji and Huiji are both Sheng's fifth daughter. The account names used in this house for trading, but the transactions were completed on April 22. Usually, transactions are negotiated by telephone or by me to 263 Jules Prost Road to contact the fifth lady at her residence. The phone number of the fifth lady's house is 73884. There is no number for the telephone to chat. The fifth lady did not make any transactions after the settlement, and the transactions made by the fifth lady were short sales rather than long positions, resulting in a lot of losses, and there were various rumors outside, which made her feel disheartened. The transactions were terminated, and the phone used for telephone chat was removed at the end of April. Moreover, the transactions she made since March have always been short positions. The payment was made by checks from the Zhonghui Bank on Tianjin Road. It is unknown whether she is still trading at other brokerages. Sheng Shengyi has never traded in this house. The fifth lady's payment is usually collected by me, or the tea servant will go to collect the receipt, etc. Then, Sun Bangrui took the case to testify that the transactions made by Miss Sheng Wu in this house were contacted by phone, and most of the calls were answered by Miss Wu herself. As for the rumors about the Sheng family, I have never heard of them in the market. I talked about the removal of the phone by Miss Wu at the Social Bureau, saying that it was indeed because of losses and rumors. Sheng Laoqi (Sheng Shengyi) has no transactions in this house, and it has absolutely nothing to do with the transactions made by Miss Wu, etc. The court then summoned Yu Qiaqing to the case. He was informed that according to the Criminal Procedure Law, conclusive evidence must be provided before demolition or disposal can be initiated. Therefore, all citizens have the obligation to testify. You are a member of society and a giant in the business world. Your knowledge is naturally richer than others, and this case is of great importance, so this court summons you to testify. You must tell the truth to the best of your knowledge. Yu said yes, so he was ordered to take an oath before being interrogated. Yu gave a detailed account of the whole process, which lasted more than an hour. The summary is recorded below. According to him, I am one of the founders of the Exchange. At the beginning of the establishment, the intention was very good, because after the Exchange, the market price could be stabilized, but now it has been used as a base for manipulation and speculation, which is something that we founders could not have expected. Since the turmoil in the yarn exchange occurred this time, the yarn price has reached a maximum of 295 yuan, resulting in more than 40 million yuan in imported cotton yarn from various countries. Originally, this matter had nothing to do with me, but for the sake of society and people's livelihood, I had to intervene. After the turmoil occurred, it was reported that I, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xiaolai served as mediators, but Du was a director of the Exchange, and Wang was a supervisor of the Exchange. It is impossible to act as a mediator at all, and I have no mediation facts, so in addition to declaring a correction, I also believe that those who speculate and manipulate this time cannot succeed without wealthy people. And since they already have huge sums of money, it is especially hateful to engage in this speculation and manipulation. Therefore, I especially telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report and request a thorough investigation to give these people a warning. Chairman Chiang ordered the Ministry of Industry to investigate. When the Vice Minister of the Ministry and the Director of Yan and Counselor Chen came to Shanghai to investigate, they talked to me. After I told them that the big long-term holders in this rumor were Wu Ruiyuan, Xu Maochang, and Sheng Shengyi, etc., this rumor may be a market rumor or a rumor in the society. Wu Ruiyuan is a director, and Sheng is a current official. Most of them should not engage in this speculation. Although Xu is a businessman, he receives too much goods, which affects the market price, so I especially mentioned it. However, the accounts of the Exchange mostly use aliases, and it is difficult to investigate thoroughly. Moreover, the margin collected this time is more than 20 million, and the checks issued by each household are as high as hundreds of thousands, which cannot be done without wealth or strength, so the method of thorough investigation is to check the check stubs. However, most of the checks belong to foreign banks, and it is difficult for the court to investigate, so the purpose of the government authorities transferring this case to your court is here. As for Wu Ruiyuan, Xu Maochang, and Sheng Shengyi as long-term big households, they are all rumors, but there is no smoke without fire, but it cannot be said for sure. As for the statement that I said to Counselor Chen that the long-term holders planned to raise the price to 320 yuan, it is also a rumor in the air. It is speculated that this air was released by the long-term holders, and the purpose is to be able to settle the price and sell it. The turmoil in the yarn exchange occurred once in July and August last year, but this time it is very serious, and later it was involved in litigation because of this, but I can't remember who is suing whom. I have never heard of Qixing Company before, but I heard of it recently. Because its first word is seven, it is expected that it is organized by seven people. Sheng Shengyi is the seventh, so it is suspected that it is related to the company, but when I talked to the representatives of the Ministry of Industry, there was no sure word for course. I only deduced it from speculation. As for saying that Sheng made hundreds of millions of profits, it is also a rumor. As for how Qixing Company is organized and where the location is, I don't know. Wu Qiding has never been heard to be related to this matter, and has never reported it. What I said to the personnel of the Ministry of Industry before that Wu may be related to the matter actually means that Wu may have had transactions before. This time, I have never heard of it, and officials cannot do business according to law, because it is easy to manipulate things. The boundary between officials and businessmen in the Qing Dynasty was very clear, but now it is difficult to distinguish, because now all banks have official shares joining, and the official share directors they send are officials or merchants. The purpose of my request for thorough investigation is not necessarily to convict people, but to seek a slight punishment so that they dare not manipulate things again. I also talked about this intention with Chairman Chiang. I said that we must know who the manipulators are, etc., and submitted a written statement, saying that what I want to say is all in this written statement. Prosecutor Song then ordered to sign and keep the volume. At this point, Yu's statement was over. Song asked a few more questions and then ordered him to leave. He then summoned Shen Sidong, Chen Rentao, Li Yujun, etc. to inquire about the reasons why Mu Xiangyue, Sun Yufeng, and Dong Zaisun were not present, and then announced the adjournment of the court. It was already past 11:30. Tomorrow morning will be the summoning of Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi, two suspects. The court is still the Fifth Court.

### Cooler Weather, Fewer Epidemics

The weather in this city was suddenly very hot a few days ago. The number of patients has surged, and all epidemic hospitals and epidemic departments attached to public and private hospitals have been opened one after another, and the consultations are quite busy. However, the heat has decreased in recent days, and the number of patients has also decreased significantly. The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital had a maximum of 330 outpatient visits per day. Recently, the number of people seeking medical attention has been reduced to less than 200 per day, but there are still many patients with gastroenteritis. Residents should be careful with their diet. According to the Shanghai Port Quarantine Office, the infectious diseases in Shanghai Port last week included 8 cases of smallpox, with 1 death, 30 cases of typhoid fever, with 21 deaths, 16 cases of bacterial dysentery, with 2 deaths, 14 cases of diphtheria, with 2 deaths, and 25 cases of scarlet fever, with 3 deaths. In total, there were 96 cases of various infectious diseases last week, with 30 deaths. Cholera was not found, and the whole country is safe.

### The Robbery of Fu Wenhao's House: The Robbers Are Sentenced

Sentenced to Five Years in Prison; The Defendant Will Appeal

The house of A.A., a famous socialite from Sichuan, formerly known as Chuan Wenhao, at No. 72 Avenue Albert, French Concession, was robbed by two tenants who claimed to be students of the Law and Politics College in the loft of the second floor. They stole more than 4,000 yuan worth of clothing, jewelry, and cash. The two tenants then fled. After reporting the robbery and requesting arrest, the tenants, Cheng Yuanyuan and Cheng Jingfa, a pair of siblings, were seen on Xiafei Road on the afternoon of May 29th this year by Lin Chuanyao, a young Cantonese man, who pointed him out as one of the robbers in the Chuan family robbery case last year. After the arrest, they were sent to the Special Second Court. After interrogation by Judge Chen Shuoying, the police department filed a lawsuit according to law, but Lin consistently denied the charges and presented counter-evidence, hiring a lawyer to defend him. The plaintiff insisted that Lin was one of the robbers in the case and filed an incidental civil lawsuit. After repeated court investigations and inquiries, the trial was concluded and the date for sentencing was set, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, Chen came to the first court and sentenced Lin Chuanyao to five years of imprisonment for robbery with a deadly weapon by a group of three or more people. The incidental civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court. Lin expressed dissatisfaction with the sentence and prepared to file an appeal with the High Branch Court after receiving the judgment.

### American Woman Transporting Opium Escorted to Shanghai

The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Fober, an enforcement officer of the U.S. Court for China, flew to Hankou on Friday morning to investigate the case of an American woman smuggling opium. When the woman arrived in Hankou, customs officers found some opium in her luggage, and she was arrested by the Chinese authorities.

### The Murder Case on Zhuhu Road

A Woman Was Stabbed in the Stomach, Her Intestines Came Out, and She Died from Serious Injuries; Her Lover Was Also Seriously Injured and His Life Is in Danger

Zhu Songshou, a 24-year-old man from Yangzhou residing at No. 8, Lane 31, Zhuhu Road, Gaochang Temple, Shanghai South, works at the Shanghai Copper Steel Factory in Gaochang Temple. On the fourth day of the third month of the lunar calendar last year, he married Wang, an 18-year-old woman from Gaoyou, through a matchmaker. The couple lived in harmony, but they had no children. Later, due to financial constraints, Wang went to work at a Chinese and foreign cloth factory near Sanguantang, Lujiazhaing, South City, to supplement the family income. Unexpectedly, the tragedy started from there. Xia Yuntang, an 18-year-old male worker from Ningbo in the same factory, saw that Wang was beautiful and seduced her. Wang was also fickle and spent time with him day and night, admiring each other. From then on, the two were deeply in love, reaching a boiling point. At 8:30 last night, Xia was so obsessed with lust that he went to Zhu's house to carry out his ultimate purpose with Wang. Her husband, Zhu Songshou, had suspected something beforehand, but he had not acted due to his face. Last night, he happened to return home at the same time and caught a glimpse of the adulterer. He was burned with jealousy, grabbed a sharp blade, and stabbed Xia in the vitals four times. Then, he stabbed his wife in the waist and abdomen seven or eight times, causing her intestines to flow out and blood to cover the ground. The cruelty of the adultery and murder was beyond words. The police arrived and sent the two injured to the Shanghai South Hospital for treatment. Wang eventually died from her injuries shortly after arriving at the hospital, around 9:00 PM. Xia's life is also in danger. According to the doctor, abdominal surgery is required, and the operation will be performed after his family members sign. The murderer, Zhu Songshou, surrendered himself to the police station and awaits legal judgment.

### The Hei Lanqing Estate Dispute - Both Parties File Appeals

Hei Zhou's wife disagrees with the original trial verdict; Hei Lang's wife believes the sentence was too lenient.

Hei Lanqing, a wealthy man from Pudong, had residences in both Shanghai and Hangzhou. He died of illness in Hangzhou in March of this year. His concubine, Zhou Huilin, colluded with the accountant Hu Shulin and others like Chuan Jiafu (also known as Fu Minzhai) and Peng Ren to embezzle Hei Lanqing's vast estate, including deeds, stocks, and jewelry. Zhou and the others brought the shares that Lanqing possessed in the Shanghai British Gas Company to Shanghai with the intention of changing the stock registration to Zhou Huilin's name. Hei's principal wife, Lang, and her children became aware of this. They hired lawyer Zhao Chuanding to report the matter to the Lao Zha Police Station, filing a lawsuit against Zhou and the other four for embezzlement in the Special First Court. Hei Lang and others also filed a private prosecution. After investigation by the Special Court, Hu Shulin and Chuan Jiafu were each fined 1,000 yuan, Peng Ren was fined 300 yuan, and Hei Zhou Huilin was fined 800 yuan with a two-year suspended sentence. Hei Zhou's wife, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyers Yu Xiangqin and others to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting that the original verdict be overturned and that she be declared innocent. Her main argument was that Hei Zhou's wife was legally married to Jian Lanqing. Hei Lang and others also believed that the original trial's sentence was too lenient and that granting suspended sentences after fines were imposed would not serve as a sufficient deterrent. They also hired lawyers Qin Liankui and others to simultaneously file an appeal. Yesterday morning, presiding Judge Yu Huating, along with judges Zhou Han and Peng Shi, and prosecutor Lin Wopeng, convened the First Criminal Court. After hearing arguments, the lawyers for both sides presented their cases. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu argued that the original verdict was appropriate and requested that the appeal be dismissed. Judge Yu announced the end of the arguments and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the morning of the 23rd.

### Kidnapped Primary School Student Escapes from Robber's Den and Returns Home

Four suspects remain in custody; the family is overjoyed at the return of the hostage.

Lu Changsheng, a resident of Rehe Road, made his fortune by renting rickshaws and had some savings. After Lu's death, his nine-year-old son, Deming, attended the Nanyang Primary School nearby. On the morning of June 23 of this year, at approximately 9:00 AM, Lu Deming was being escorted to school by his maid when he was suddenly abducted by several kidnappers. Lu's family reported the incident to the police, requesting an investigation. The Chinese Detective Chief Shang Wu of the Central District Police Station arrested suspects Zhou Changgui, Yao Fuquan (also known as Yao Pei), Lu Shougou, and Zhou's mistress Liu Ruanshi. After being arrested and detained, Zhou Changgui suddenly used a bamboo chopstick to stab himself in the temple, attempting suicide. Fortunately, the detectives discovered this and sent Zhou to the hospital for treatment. Yao, Lu, and Liu were sent to the Special First Court. The interrogation revealed that the hostage had not yet been released and that accomplices remained at large, so the case was postponed. It was requested that the newspapers temporarily withhold reporting this news until the hostage was returned. In recent days, Chinese and foreign detectives involved in the case have been making every effort to capture the remaining members of the gang and rescue the hostage. Unexpectedly, the hostage Lu Deming suddenly returned home alone by rickshaw from the robber's den at approximately 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The family was overjoyed and reported to the police. They will provide a full account in court during the next hearing.

### Love Triangle Turns Violent: A Horrific Act of Cutting Off a Woman's Tongue

Ms. Cao's tongue is severed by half, rendering her speech unclear; she cries loudly in court and collapses to the ground.

Human hearts are not what they used to be, and the world is deteriorating. Previously, a love triangle incident involving a bitten-off tongue occurred in Hangzhou, causing a sensation. Unexpectedly, a similar incident of cutting off a tongue occurred in the bustling city of Shanghai the other day, a coincidence. The details of the incident are recorded below:

Cao Sanbao, a 29-year-old woman from Yancheng, works at the Yong'an Textile Factory. Her home is in a shack at 199 Mabai Road in Shanghai West. Cao is attractive and was promised in marriage by her mother at a young age. However, Chen Wei, a man from Funing, Jiangbei, lives next door to Cao. They met frequently, and over time, feelings developed. This secret affair was discovered by Cao's brother, who confronted Chen Wei, leading to a lawsuit and deep animosity between the two sides. At 2:10 PM the day before yesterday, Chen Wei, along with his brother Chen Weizhi and Gu Ruguo, waited for Cao Sanbao in an open area on Mabai Road. When they saw Cao Sanbao approaching alone, they rushed forward. Chen Weizhi and Gu Ruquan grabbed Cao's hands. As Cao cried out, Chen Wei suddenly stepped forward and cut off half of Cao's tongue with a sharp pair of scissors. Blood immediately filled her mouth, and she screamed for help, managing to grab Chen Weizhi. The other two escaped. Constable 329 and Chinese detective Chen Hongbin arrived and took the accomplice Chen Weizhi to the Putuo Road Police Station for detention. Cao was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang sent the suspect to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, charged under Article 278, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law for causing serious injury. He stated the case details, noting that accomplices remained at large and the victim's injuries were severe, requesting a postponement. Cao Sanbao provided a statement, but because half of her tongue was gone, her speech was unclear. She only identified the defendants Gu Ruguo and Chen Weizhi, who held her hands, and Chen Wei, who cut off her tongue with scissors. She then broke down in tears and collapsed to the ground, moving those who heard her story. The defendant Chen Weizhi gave evasive answers and claimed ignorance. Judge Huang Risheng ordered the defendant to be detained pending further hearing on the 28th of this month and ordered Cao to be sent to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the hospital does not have adequate treatment for the severed tongue. Not only is her speech unclear, but her eating is also greatly affected, causing deep suffering.

### Sichuan Shops Promote Iced White Fungus

Sichuan shops on Nanjing Road in this city, due to the scorching weather and the arrival of high summer, are promoting iced white fungus. The method is to first cook a certain amount of genuine Sichuan white fungus using the traditional method, and then refrigerate it. This turns it into iced white fungus. This cold drink is truly precious and high-end, as it not only cools and relieves heat but also strengthens the body. It has the effects of reducing internal heat, refreshing the mind, nourishing the lungs, moistening the intestines, promoting bowel movements, and aiding digestion. Especially in the summer when people sleep late and injure their yin energy, eating it can nourish yin and replenish blood. That it can be used as a high-grade dessert is secondary.

### Exquisite Air Conditioning is Open

The Exquisite Food Company on Yinhua Street, Nanjing Road in this city, is centrally located, has comfortable seating, and all tableware is disinfected after use. The dishes are fresh and clean and each has its own flavor, so business is very developed. Since the launch of the car delivery service last year, it has been welcomed by all sectors. As summer approaches, the weather is extremely hot. Although there are fans, they are not as comfortable as air conditioning. The store invested heavily in air conditioning equipment. Standard air conditioning is now open, it is cool and pleasant, and customers have been even more crowded in recent days.

### Breaking Through the "Treaty Under the City Walls"

-- Ruo Yun

These past few days, the situation in North China has fallen into chaos again. The officials of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, on the one hand, are conducting so-called "peace" talks with Japan in the form of local incidents. Surrounded by traitors and amidst the enemy's tricks, it is inevitable that they will knowingly accept "compromise" terms. We cannot know what the conditions are, but based on past lessons and the current situation, there is no doubt that China will suffer a great loss once these "peace" talks succeed. It is even possible that the entirety of North China will be sacrificed in this convivial gathering!

On the other hand, under the smokescreen of so-called peace talks, military movements have not only not stopped but are intensifying. "According to [Reuters] reports, the Japanese army will make expelling 12,000 Chinese troops from Nanwan its primary objective in its operational strategy. Although the 18-hour ceasefire yesterday slightly eased the tense atmosphere locally, and the Hebei-Chahar Political Council personnel and the Japanese military authorities have reopened negotiations in Tianjin, observers at home and abroad generally believe that this must be a delaying tactic by the Japanese side. It is expected that the Japanese military authorities are merely waiting for the right opportunity, and once reinforcements have gathered, they will begin to expel the 29th Army from outside the borders of Hebei." (See the Central News Agency's Reuters dispatch from the 15th) This observation by observers at home and abroad is undoubtedly very accurate. Have we not already been subjected to several "delaying tactics" under the smokescreen of peace talks, as we learned from the lessons of the January 28th Incident? And now, it is exactly the same! Otherwise, if the Japanese side has sincere intentions for peace, why would they continue to "continue to conscript large numbers of troops from home and abroad to move towards Pingjin. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 15th) And also claim that the North China Incident is serious, so this action is necessary!" (Ibid.) Even if we take a step back and say that the peace talks are not a "delaying tactic," then the purpose of the Japanese conscripting Japanese troops from home and abroad to move towards Pingjin is nothing more than to use military force to threaten, in order to achieve the goal of a "treaty under the city walls." Surrounded by such small figures and heavy troops, who can believe that the peace talks will not result in national humiliation and loss of sovereignty?

We cherish peace deeply. For the nearly six years since the September 18th Incident, we have always been prepared to accept genuine peace talks. However, perhaps precisely because we love peace too much, we have always received humiliating "agreements" in various incidents! But now, we can no longer tolerate it. Even if there are petty people who, for their own selfish interests, violate the will of the entire nation and sign a humiliating "agreement," the people of the entire country will swear to never agree, not even to the champagne made from the blood and tears of the entire nation. If you don't believe it, please open your eyes and take a look at the high tide of united resistance against the enemy and national salvation that has risen throughout the country! This impending high tide will not only drown all the traitors and those who violate the will of the people, but will also directly attack the foreign enemies of our nation!

Of course, we have not forgotten the value of peace. Therefore, we are also very willing to accept peace negotiations. But these negotiations should be based on the principles of equality and take a public form. Moreover, the accounts must be settled from the beginning. It cannot be resolved by treating it as a local incident. As far as the North China Incident is concerned, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has no authority to sign any "agreement," and all previous humiliating agreements should be written off!

Otherwise, only war remains! It is not that we are warlike, but rather it is the only means to break through the "treaty under the city walls" that we are forced to use. If you do not want to be a subjugated people!
