[Guihua] The air defense exercise on the 7th proceeded as follows: On the morning of the 7th, aircraft flew from Suiyuan to reconnaissance areas north of Suiyuan, including Bailingmiao and Xilamulun Temple (i.e., Damaoshi). They returned to Suiyuan before 10:00 AM. Assuming an enemy air raid, the Suiyuan Border Air Defense Command received a report from the Wuchuan County surveillance post and immediately issued an emergency alert. After the aircraft arrived, they assumed that incendiary bombs were dropped in the Nanhai Cave area of Suiyuan City, causing a fire. At the same time, poison gas bombs were also dropped. Several thatched houses had been erected in front of the Nanhai Cave in advance, and flames immediately shot into the sky. After receiving the report, the fire brigade rushed to the scene for rescue, and the health team disinfected the poisoned area. Traffic control was implemented throughout the city, and pedestrians were cut off. All shops were closed, and business was temporarily suspended. The fire brigade worked extremely quickly and bravely, and the water hoses of the fire engines exerted great power. Nanhai Cave is a large natural well in Suiyuan, as famous as Yuyuan Well. Because it was easier for the fire brigade to draw water, the effect was even greater. Rong Honglu, Fu Zuoyi, all the judges, and personnel from various agencies visited Nanhai Cave. After the fire was extinguished, several places in the old and new cities were poisoned again. Fire and rescue operations were carried out simultaneously, and the situation was extremely tense. Fu Zuoyi and others personally went to inspect the poisoned area outside the North Gate. The exercise ended at around 10:30 AM, and the alert was lifted. At 11:30 AM, aircraft dropped bombs in small fortresses designated near the racetrack and Longquan Park for public viewing. For a time, the area outside the cordon of the racetrack was crowded with spectators. The pilots and others flew two aircraft in the air, performing ascents, descents, and somersaults. Their amazing skills were astonishing, and the audience cheered, shaking the mountains. Over a dozen live bombs were dropped with great accuracy, which was thought-provoking. Afterwards, Ma Bingren and others, the commanders of the Suiyuan Air Defense Command, personally went to inspect the bombing site. Some soldiers also conducted engineering exercises, with excellent results. The aircraft that came to Suiyuan to participate in the air defense exercise are scheduled to leave Suiyuan and fly south on the 9th, possibly taking the route through Beiping.

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan recently ordered all provincial and municipal governments to strictly supervise the promotion of administrative work according to plans and to submit annual and monthly plan forms on time. The original order stated, "In order to integrate administrative plans with budgets, the Executive Yuan issued an order in December of last year that the administrative plans of all provincial and municipal governments should be submitted to the Executive Yuan 30 copies before the date for submitting budget estimates stipulated in Article 43 of the Budget Regulations (i.e., before February 15th), starting from the 26th fiscal year. Telegraphic orders were also issued to urge submission. However, now that it is June, the administrative plans for the 26th fiscal year of most provinces and cities have not yet been submitted. Furthermore, the administrative plans for the 25th fiscal year of two or three provinces have also not been submitted. It is essential to understand that preparation leads to success, while lack of preparation leads to failure. Whether or not there is a plan beforehand is closely related to the establishment and abandonment of public affairs. All plans should be submitted by the end of this month without further delay. Furthermore, the administrative plans for the 26th fiscal year of all provincial and municipal governments should, in accordance with the aforementioned order, be divided into monthly degrees, and a progress schedule for the monthly work of the 26th fiscal year should be prepared. The planned items in the table should not simply be filled in with the titles of the items listed in the original plan but should be listed in detail with reference to the attached instructions and necessary steps. For those items that cannot be completed within one month, the connection between the same item of work in the preceding and following months should be noted under each item. As for the items that cannot be scheduled for monthly handling, a separate table should be prepared in addition to the monthly tables, and the reasons for not being able to schedule each item should be noted. The format of this table should be supplemented or submitted together with the plan by the end of June by all provincial and municipal governments. In addition to the separate orders, two types of table formats are copied and issued for compliance by the provincial government as soon as possible." (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Executive Yuan Approves the Regulations on Concurrent Positions for Officials of the Ministry of Industry

Other Agencies Can Refer to These Regulations for Implementation

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan, based on the report of the Ministry of Industry, stated that in order to develop the national economy and construction, the ministry has established many joint government-business companies. For the convenience of guidance and supervision, officials of the ministry must concurrently serve as directors, supervisors, or other positions to promote development. However, since these personnel are concurrently serving due to their official duties, it should be stipulated that their concurrent positions should be terminated at the same time when they leave their original positions, so that there will be a basis for personnel changes in the future. Therefore, a draft of four articles on the regulations on concurrent positions for officials of the Ministry of Industry in joint government-business companies was proposed and submitted for record. After receiving the report, the Executive Yuan found that officials of various provincial and municipal governments and the Ministry of Railways, Finance, and Communications also often concurrently serve in joint government-business companies, which is the same as the matter of the Ministry of Industry. The regulations have been approved and distributed to all provinces, municipalities, and ministries for reference and implementation. The original text of the regulations on concurrent positions for officials of the Ministry of Industry in joint government-business companies is as follows: Article 1: Officials of the Ministry of Industry who concurrently serve as directors, supervisors, or other similar positions in joint government-business companies shall terminate their concurrent positions at the same time when they leave their original positions. Article 2: Personnel of the Ministry of Industry who concurrently serve in joint government-business companies shall not receive concurrent salaries in accordance with Article 11 of the Regulations on Service for Officials. Article 3: Personnel of the Ministry of Industry who concurrently serve in joint government-business companies may claim travel expenses from the Ministry of Industry when attending meetings or performing duties in Beijing or other places, but they shall not claim again if the company has already provided travel expenses. Article 4: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Jiang told reporters on the ferry that the purpose of this inspection of the general situation of internal affairs in various provinces was to serve as a reference for future reforms. At present, the facilities in various provinces are not entirely consistent due to differences in local conditions and customs, but they are all able to abide by the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government and strive to promote all public affairs. The training of the people in various provinces has been successful. In particular, rural construction is being promoted consistently from the provincial government to the county government. At present, attention is being paid to the rural construction areas in various provinces, which can truly establish the foundation for local autonomy.

This spirit is fully demonstrated everywhere, which is truly unprecedented and makes me feel extremely excited from the bottom of my heart.

[Nanjing] The central government held its 79th Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 7th. Committee members Ju Zheng, Zhang Ji, and all staff members, totaling about 700 people, attended. After Chairman Ju Zheng presided over the ceremony, he reported on "Hopes for and Seriousness Regarding the Election of National Assembly Representatives," the main points of which are as follows: "The sole duty of this National Assembly is to formulate a constitution, and the National Assembly is also the first gateway to constitutional government. Whether constitutional government can be smoothly promoted in the future will depend on the results of the general election of this National Assembly. Since the duties of the National Assembly are so important, we should, of course, be extremely cautious and thoughtful about the election of its representatives. This election must be able to accurately reflect the public opinion of the people of the whole country so that each elected representative can be commensurate with his or her position. Therefore, while we must abide by the provisions of the election law, we must also pay attention to the election of "the virtuous and upright." When we are electing, we cannot but have a few criteria to decide on selection and rejection with respect to the candidates. The first is a noble personality, the second is rich knowledge and experience, the third is enthusiasm for social welfare undertakings, and the fourth is those who have made revolutionary achievements." From the above points, we can reach a conclusion, which is that for the elected representatives, we should be prudent and thoughtful in accordance with the above criteria to form a correct and complete election. He went on to say, "To obtain a correct election, we must find ways to eliminate all election fraud. On the one hand, we should correct the errors in the election, and on the other hand, we should sanction election crimes." Finally, he said, "To enable the election to accurately reflect public opinion, to make counter-revolutionaries dare not infringe on the final key of the election, we must rely on the fair trial of the judiciary, and in election lawsuits, we must approach them with an agile attitude (Article 58 of the Election Law) so as not to hinder the progress of election affairs," and so on.

[Nanjing] The National Government held a Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 7th, attended by Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, and other officials from the National Government and various ministries and commissions, totaling more than 400 people.

Next, he described the harm of opium, and then he described that the government, in order to awaken the nation's attention to the opium suppression issue, has designated "June 3rd" as Opium Suppression Memorial Day since the 18th year of the Republic of China, and has adopted a policy of banning opium year by year based on Premier Sun Yat-sen's instruction to reject drugs. Finally, he said, "Recently, there have been obvious violations of the ban. The drug-planting policy of some shameless traitors is a hundred times more vicious than oppression by force. On the one hand, we hope that friendly countries will, in the spirit of 'Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself,' automatically assist us in suppressing drugs, but we must also recognize the ancient训 of 'It is better to rely on ourselves than to rely on others,' and that everyone should automatically rise up to ban smoking, planting, manufacturing, and transporting, which will be more effective. Only then can we achieve the goal of complete prohibition and complete the task of national revival." (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Hopes for the Future of Military Reorganization in Sichuan and Xikang

— Du

The once-prosperous rumors of unrest in Sichuan have gradually subsided since Liu Hangchen and Guan Jiyu repeatedly smoothed things over. Before the mountain rain comes, the wind fills the tower. It is truly caused by those who are overly sensitive and like to make sensational claims. However, reflecting on the past, which is unbearable to look back on, we are like a bird that has been wounded, startled by the sound of a bow. Fortunately, concrete measures have been drafted for the reorganization of military affairs in Sichuan and Xikang. Liu Xiang has repeatedly expressed his sincere support for the central government, and the generals stationed in various places have also expressed their acceptance. The so-called military reorganization plan has already entered the stage of implementation. Once Liu and Guan return to their posts to discuss the details, and senior central government officials jointly enter Sichuan, it will not be difficult to eliminate the thin haze and slight stains, usher in a new grand plan, and ensure long-term stability. The sensational rumors will naturally be suppressed invisibly.

Regarding the military reorganization plan in Sichuan and Xikang, although no explicit details have been seen, it is not difficult for us to understand its outline if we seek a reasonable target in principle. When the military reorganization conference in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces opened, Liu Zhi, in his capacity as chairman, repeatedly and clearly elaborated on the purpose of reorganizing the army: first, to unify military administration and military orders; second, to improve education and training. Liu also stated that only a nationalized and modernized army can wash away any humiliating national shame and resolve any serious national crisis. His words are grand and consistent with reason. In short, the purpose of reorganizing the army is nothing more than to improve quality and strengthen national defense. Under this meaning, how can we not express our heartfelt expectations for the reorganization of the army? In any country, the unification of government orders is undoubtedly difficult. If one only possesses a large number of troops, each with its own commander, with collections unrelated, and organizations seeking their own interests, it will not only violate the system and make assessment difficult, but also lead to differences of opinion and misunderstandings. On ordinary days, it will not only fail to provide local security but will also burden the people's livelihood. When national crises are imminent, how can it be used to deal with them? The result is only to give the spies a loophole and accelerate the deepening of the national disaster. Given the reality, it is necessary to seek remedies. The method of reorganization and combing should not be delayed.

Moreover, some say that the independent inheritance of our country's army and the difficulty of controlling military personnel have been ingrained for a long time. The source has been around for a long time, and the hidden dangers are still deep. Those in charge of national affairs have never been unaware of the non-plan of divergence, but they suffer from the difficulty of achieving centralization. This time, the central government is vigorously implementing the military reorganization plan. First, there was the reorganization of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies. Next, there was the transfer of jurisdiction over the old Northeast Army. Now, the military reorganization plan for Sichuan and Xikang is also being implemented. This is unprecedented. It is due to the far-reaching efforts of the highest authorities and the effective implementation of mutual sincerity between local leaders. It is also because of the current critical situation and the fear of emptiness. Fearing that there is no way to protect the overturned nest from collapsing, they can gather government orders into one body. After this reorganization is completed, I know that the national army will be able to unify its will and take action to jointly resolve the national crisis. The people are looking forward to it.

### Belgian Foreign Minister Banquets Kong Xiangxi; Closer Relations Between China and Belgium

Belgium Invested in China Earliest; China Prepares to Cooperate with Belgium

Brussels: Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, and members of the Chinese delegation, arrived here at 2:56 PM today at the formal invitation of the Belgian government. Representatives appointed by Minister of Transportation Jaspar and Foreign Minister Spaak, namely Baron Guy de Joa, Belgian Minister to China; Zhu Hexiang, Chinese Minister to Belgium; General Nissen, Belgian Plenipotentiary Minister and President of the Army University; and a representative of the Belgian Railway Company, went to the station to greet them. A large crowd of people went to the station to welcome them, including more than 100 Chinese expatriates. At 7:30 PM, the Chinese expatriates held a tea party at the Chinese Legation in Belgium to welcome Vice President Kong. Foreign Minister Spaak hosted a banquet at 8:00 PM. During the banquet, Spaak and Vice President Kong both delivered speeches. Vice President Kong and his delegation are very busy traveling in Europe, so they can only stay in Brussels for two days and will depart for Berlin on the 9th of this month. (Havas, 6th, Central News Agency)

Brussels: Foreign Minister Spaak hosted a banquet tonight for Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, and members of the Chinese delegation. Foreign Minister Spaak delivered a speech, stating that the friendship between China and Belgium is based on cultural cooperation and has a long history. Many Chinese students have traveled far to study in Belgium. As of the end of last year, there were as many as 200 Chinese students in Belgium. Since the establishment of the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee, the number of students studying in Belgium has increased even more. In addition, the Higher Institute of Chinese Studies in Belgium has established a Chinese language course at the University of Ghent and has repeatedly launched various Sino-Belgian art exhibitions. The Belgian painting exhibition held in Shanghai is one example. All of this is enough to make the spiritual connection between China and Belgium closer. In terms of material aspects, the commercial relationship between China and Belgium is quite important. Belgium was the earliest to invest in and assist China in developing minerals and building railways. Belgium has also provided loans for various public works in China. Furthermore, the Chinese Nationalist Party is based on democratic politics and seeks the reform of China. The situation of cyclical civil war has become a thing of the past. The whole country is now united and striving for governance. All of this is the merit of General Chiang Kai-shek. And Vice President Kong's rectification of finance and currency reform are even more indispensable. Vice President Kong then stood up to give a reply, first expressing his gratitude for the Belgian government's invitation and Foreign Minister Spaak's hospitality. He then said that this was the first time he had visited Belgium, 30 years ago, and had returned several times since then. Each time he visited, he felt endless interest and happiness. He dared to say that he knew Belgium very well, and the Chinese people admired the heroic and promising Belgium. In terms of Sino-Belgian cultural and economic relations, sending Chinese students to study in Belgium, hiring Belgian engineers for Chinese railways, and building Chinese railways with Belgian investment and materials are all things we are fortunate for. To give an example, the Yellow River Bridge of the Pinghan Railway in China was built by Belgian engineers. At that time, it was guaranteed for 25 years, and 25 years have long passed, but the Yellow River Bridge is still in good condition. The achievements of Belgian engineers are truly commendable. The Zhengtai Railway, which runs from Taiyuan, Shanxi, to Zhengding, Hebei, in my native Shanxi Province, was also built by Belgium and is extremely strong. That is another example. At present, we are carrying out a national construction plan and need the assistance of foreign investment. On this important issue, as with other issues, China is ready to cooperate with Belgium, because Belgium never interferes in Chinese politics. Although my visit here has been short, I will have the opportunity to discuss with many important people in your country. I am confident that the exchange of views will achieve the most satisfactory results for both China and Belgium. I now raise my glass to wish His Majesty King Leopold and the royal family good health, and to wish our friendly country, Belgium, prosperity, and Belgium long live. After the banquet, a grand reception was held with many important figures from China and Belgium in attendance. (Havas, 6th, Central News Agency)

[Paris] The moderate newspaper *L'Ordre* recently published an article by the famous reporter Scherpe, titled "The Man Who Transforms China," discussing Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China's visit to France. First, it described the warm welcome Kong received in Paris. It then stated that Kong had held negotiations with the British government on financial issues in London, which were quite effective. The talks between Kong and Chen Shaokuan, Chinese Minister of the Navy, and the French authorities in Paris are also of considerable significance. According to observers familiar with the situation in the Far East, there has been a significant economic recovery in China, which is undoubtedly true. The left-wing Radical Socialist Party newspaper *L'Action Française* reported that General Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan of China, assisted by Vice President Kong, is the most important factor in world politics. The United Kingdom has already realized the importance of China's recovery, as can be seen from the government's dispatch of financial expert Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to China and Japan. Regarding this recovery, Vice President Kong is implementing a comprehensive plan in an orderly manner. Its various programs include: (1) the reform of the Chinese customs system, because Chinese customs revenue is the main guarantee for China's foreign debt; (2) the practical clarification of China's financial situation, first by formulating unified regulations for the minting of silver coins, and then by taking various measures, such as (a) reorganizing the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications so that they, together with the soon-to-be-reorganized Central Reserve Bank, become the three major financial institutions standing side by side; (b) nationalizing silver, centralizing the right to issue banknotes, and controlling foreign exchange; (c) consolidating domestic debt; and (d) continuing to repay foreign debt principal and interest. This policy, although not without boldness, has achieved satisfactory results, that is, the economic situation in China has now recovered. (Havas, 7th, Central News Agency)

### Hitler's Speech: Armed Peace

Germany Marches Forward Courageously; No One Can Stop It

Berlin: In Regensburg, Bavaria, 150,000 members of the Nazi Party held a conference today. Hitler delivered a public speech, with the following slogan: "No power, whether domestic or foreign, is sufficient to stop us from moving forward." Hitler defended Germany's rearmament and criticized democracy while supporting National Socialism. Hitler said, "People ask why Germany is unwilling to disarm. Germany is unwilling to disarm because Germany is now suspicious of other countries. If they want to disarm, other countries should take the lead. In the past, when Germany disarmed, other countries should have enjoyed the benefits of disarmament, but they were indifferent until Germany rearmed, and then they realized it." Hitler criticized the key points of democratic politics, such as labor unrest and civil disturbances. Therefore, what Germany has achieved in the past four years can only be established under National Socialism. Hitler then stated on the dispute between politics and religion that Germany cannot tolerate religious struggles, saying, "God did not divide mankind. God's omnipotent work will not be destroyed by our enemies." (Reuters, 6th, Central News Agency)

Regensburg: Hitler reiterated Germany's peaceful intentions, but also said that although Germany loves peace, it is unwilling to tolerate unprovoked insults and attacks. If anyone believes that the German people need peace, they can take the action of bombing German ships performing international duties. We must make it clear that we are quite capable of self-defense. Regarding the issue of armaments, Hitler declared, "A few days ago, British politicians said that Britain must rearm in order to maintain peace. I am happy to hear this, because Germany also adopts the same attitude." (7th, National Telegraph)

Berlin: German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels said in a speech in Frankfurt today that the Nazi Party aims to increase the national population to between 80 and 90 million. (Reuters, 7th, Central News Agency)

After a six-hour general meeting today, the United Auto Workers of America (UAW) announced its acceptance of the mediation plan by a five-to-one majority.

### Manila Residents: Three New Cases of Mental Illness Daily Among 290,000 Residents

[Manila]

According to official records released here, among Manila's 290,000 residents, an average of three people are admitted to mental hospitals each day due to mental illness. The hospitals are now full. Therefore, the Director of Health has sent a letter to the Mayor of Manila, requesting an immediate increase in funding to add hospital equipment. It is said that the mental hospitals have stopped admitting patients for over two months, and there are now over a hundred people waiting to be admitted. Manila continues to detain those suffering from mental illness every day, but due to overcrowding in the hospitals, they are being held at police stations without proper medical care. Although the Director of Health has made this request, the Manila City Council is unlikely to allocate the funds due to budget constraints. If the central government does not provide assistance, there will ultimately be no place to house the mentally ill. (Central News Agency, 6th, Reuters)

### Hirota Resolves to Improve Sino-Japanese Relations from a Broad Perspective

And Strives to Promote Japanese Goods Abroad to Rescue Soaring Domestic Prices

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Koki Hirota met with envoys from various countries at 2:00 PM today. When meeting with Yang Yunzhu, our acting chargé d'affaires in Japan, he first expressed his gratitude for the congratulatory telegram from our Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui and recalled his meeting with Foreign Minister Wang a year and a half ago. He said that he found his meeting with Foreign Minister Wang very pleasant and that this feeling has not changed. Hirota also told Chargé d'Affaires Yang that when he was in charge of foreign affairs last time, he had the determination to improve Sino-Japanese relations. However, he regretted that he was unable to complete this wish before leaving office. He currently still holds this determination. Hirota then solemnly stated that the Sino-Japanese problem must be resolved, not only all outstanding issues but also problems that arise from time to time. However, relations between the two countries should be improved from a broad perspective. Finally, Hirota expressed his deep admiration for the efforts of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Qun in handling the Sino-Japanese situation in the past, saying that the Japanese government will do its best to make China understand Japan. (Central News Agency, 7th)

[Tokyo] Japan's excess of imports over exports is the main reason for soaring prices. It is generally believed that correcting this import surplus is an important mission of the Konoe Cabinet. In view of this, Foreign Minister Hirota is determined to strengthen the connection between diplomacy and domestic politics, and to open up trade relations and adjust the trade situation through the cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the unity of the government and the public. Foreign Minister Hirota also intends to realize the independence and strengthening of trade functions planned during his time as Prime Minister, assigning the Trade Bureau to investigate overseas market conditions.

Therefore, all policies will be established based on this guiding spirit. (Domei News Agency, 7th)

[Tokyo] The Konoe Cabinet's program and policies have been decided by today's cabinet meeting. However, Prime Minister Konoe believes that the guiding spirit of the new cabinet has been clarified by the statement and broadcast speech on the 4th. He feels that the traditional cabinet's enumeration and announcement of the items of the political program and policies is too formal and meaningless. Therefore, at the beginning of today's cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister explained his decision to stop issuing formal political program and policy statements for the new cabinet and to sincerely strive to implement various innovative policies, realizing the ideal of doing things with the unity of the whole country, and requested understanding. All cabinet members unanimously expressed their support. Therefore, the new cabinet broke with old practices and stopped issuing statements of its political program and policies, with only the Chief Secretary issuing a summary of the cabinet's decisions. The fundamental guiding spirit of the Konoe Cabinet's administration is approximately as follows: ㊀ Expecting to promote and glorify the sense of the solemn national essence, namely the Japanese spirit; ㊁ Establishing guiding principles to ease domestic antagonism and achieve national unity; ㊂ Establishing genuine peace based on social justice; ㊃ Implementing reforms of various administrative affairs in order to implement various measures based on social justice.

### Australian Prime Minister Speaks to the Press About the Pacific Pact

Seeking Only to Confer, Not Undertake Military Obligations; Its Establishment Would Ease the Situation

[London] Australian Prime Minister Lyons, the Australian representative to the Imperial Conference, spoke at a banquet of the Foreign Press Association this afternoon, referring to Australia's proposed Pacific Non-Aggression Pact. He said that the balance of power created by the Washington Treaty concluded in February 1922 now seems to be in danger of being overturned. What Australia now hopes for is the establishment of a new pact that is entirely consistent with the idea of resolving disputes and does not assume military obligations, but only seeks that countries agree to confer as friends, sitting around and discussing matters. He is pleased that his proposal has been well received by the world. He believes that once the Pacific Peace Pact is established, it can alleviate the hidden worries of the entire Pacific and other parts of the world. Lyons then praised the power of newspapers to cultivate peace, saying that their power is far beyond that of politicians because newspapers have the power to shape public opinion. Guests at today's banquet included Japanese Ambassador Yoshida. (Central News Agency, 7th, Reuters)

[London] Australian Federal Prime Minister Lyons attended a banquet of the Foreign Press Association today and gave a speech. He stated that the proposal for countries bordering the Pacific to conclude a non-aggression pact is based on the principles of the League of Nations Covenant. The people of the Pacific countries all have friendly feelings, so concluding such a pact is indeed feasible. Since I put forward this proposal, not only have people in London approved it, but also many people in other places have expressed their acceptance, which is very gratifying. I firmly believe that if this non-aggression pact can be concluded, the balance of power in the Pacific countries will certainly be restored. After Lyons' speech, although many people expressed doubts about whether this pact could immediately become a reality, they all applauded his statement. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas Dispatch)

### French Prime Minister Delivers Speech on Political Achievements

First Anniversary of the People's Front Government

[Paris] The Seine Province branch of the Socialist Party recently held a gathering at the Palais de la Mutualité here to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Front government. Prime Minister Blum personally attended and delivered a speech. He first reviewed the political achievements of the People's Front government since taking office, and said, "Some people advocate implementing a dictatorial system internally and an authoritarian policy externally. The fact discovered by the French government is the opposite. What is the fact? That a democratic system can still be promoted by loyal people, and it is the best tool for justice and progress." The Prime Minister then enumerated the various difficulties that the government should resolve, such as implementing various reforms within the scope of the current administrative system, remaining faithful to the program of the People's Front, maintaining contact with various labor organizations, and at the same time, trying not to lose the sympathy of the middle class. All of these are constant difficulties. In addition, there are other temporary difficulties, namely the financial situation and the threat of war. "Our country is threatened by financial and monetary panic every month and every week, but so far, this panic has still been avoided. On the other hand, the European political situation has experienced an unprecedented crisis, but we have also been able to maintain peace and will continue to maintain peace in the future, while at the same time, we must also have the ability to protect our country's major interests." Prime Minister Blum then explained the various reforms to the labor situation, with the "Matignon Agreements" (the Matignon Palace is the Prime Minister's office) signed last year by the government, management, and labor representatives being particularly important. He said that it was the first time in history that representatives of the government, management, and labor had signed an agreement together with equal status, and the fact that management unconditionally recognized the labor unions organized by labor could also be used as evidence. As for the measures taken by the government to reform the material and spiritual conditions of labor, they include the following: ㊀ Labor holidays with pay; ㊁ Labor unions have the right to represent workers and sign labor contracts; ㊂ Forty-hour work week; ㊃ Increased wages; ㊄ Mandatory arbitration system for labor disputes; ㊅ Various measures beneficial to farmers and merchants; ㊅ Establishing a wheat marketing bureau; ㊇ Re-evaluating agricultural product prices; ㊈ Abolishing business tax; ㊉ Announcing plans to formulate laws to protect handicrafts; ㊉㊀ Disaster relief bill; ㊉㊁ Labor pension bill, etc. (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas Dispatch)

After the Arctic Air Force returned to Rudolf Island, Mazuruk's plane will be stationed on the island for a long time to transport food and supplies to the polar station for the use of Babalin, Krenkel, Shirshov, and Fedorov when necessary. The remaining planes will fly back to Moscow. At a port on Franz Josef Land or Novaya Zemlya, the sleds will be unloaded and wheels will be installed. The wheels, other equipment, instruments, summer flight suits, helmets, fresh fruit, vegetables, etc., needed by each plane have already been transported from Moscow to Arkhangelsk. After arriving in port, they will be transported to the location designated by Schmidt by the icebreaker Sadko, which is captained by the experienced Arctic Ocean captain Kratkov and will depart in a few days. Schmidt's expedition team will send a plane to fly around the Arctic Ocean to scout for the ship's track and guide the way.

Schmidt reported from Rudolf Island at 10:15 AM on the 6th, stating that everything at the polar station had been completed early that morning. At 2:00 AM, under the brilliant Arctic sun, a solemn memorial service was held by all personnel. After the meeting, the Soviet national flag was raised, everyone paid their respects, and cheered for Stalin. Schmidt said, "We felt a sense of sadness when we left the pole because we felt very comfortable living at the polar station."

The report also stated that in the evening, Rudolf Island sent a plane piloted by Kresenskiy to scout near 85 degrees North latitude. The plane landed safely on the ice floe and reported weather information to Schmidt. Later, the flag navigator Bilin led the planes directly to Rudolf Island. The climate on the island was changeable. The airport was originally shrouded in thick fog, but when the planes arrived, the fog cleared and the three planes landed safely. Alekseyev was immediately contacted by radio. The ice floe in the 85-degree area where he was preparing to land was not very suitable. After circling several times, he finally chose a better piece of ice and landed safely. The people and the plane were safe. All the personnel on the plane immediately started to clear a flight field. Rudolf Island is now preparing to send a plane to transport oil there. (TASS, 6th)

[Moscow] The Communist Party of the Ukrainian Republic recently held its 13th Congress and passed a resolution advocating the complete reorganization of the Communist Party's political work. It criticized the Central Committee of the Communist Party for being politically ignorant, saying that the Central Committee improperly allowed public enemies such as counter-revolutionaries, nationalists, and fascist agents of Germany, Japan, and Poland to hold important positions in the party. "The party organs should vigorously prevent and not condone any nationalistic tendencies in Ukraine, Russia, or any other nation." It then stated that the threat of fascist countries invading the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian Republic has greatly increased. Finally, it demanded the improvement of the Donets Coal Mine area to prevent its production from being delayed, and to eliminate bad elements within the People's Committees of light industry, food industry, and local industry.

### Britain and Germany Reach Compromise on the Spanish Question

Supervisory Warships May Defend Themselves Independently, but Retaliation Must Be Agreed Upon by Four Countries First

[Berlin] According to informed sources, the British and German governments have reached a compromise on the issue of ensuring the safety of warships from various countries participating in the supervision. The solution stipulates that when a warship participating in the supervision is attacked, on the one hand, the commanders of the naval fleets of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy should consult. On the other hand, the right of the attacked warship to defend itself is still recognized. It is generally hoped that this solution will be easily accepted by France and Italy. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas Dispatch)

[London] Regarding the issue of the safety and security of supervisory warships on the Spanish sea, the British government, after receiving a reply from the German government, recently sent a note to the German government, the most important points of which are: ㊀ The British government believes that warships participating in supervision cannot be denied the right to self-defense when attacked. Warships under attack may fire back at that time, but this right of self-defense cannot be interpreted as the right to exercise retaliation. ㊁ If retaliation is to be exercised, it must be decided after joint consultation among the countries concerned. According to responsible sources, the British government's proposal for consultation aims to separate self-defense from retaliation and that consultation is necessary to seek genuine cooperation among the countries participating in supervision. The Italian government's reply to Britain's previous proposal was also received today, and the content is largely the same as the German reply. Therefore, Britain also intends to send another note to Italy, the content of which is the same as the note sent to Germany today. According to those in charge, the Italian reply approves the establishment of a number of safe zones in Spanish ports and does not oppose consultations among the countries participating in supervision after an incident occurs. However, it still firmly insists that the right of self-defense of a warship participating in supervision should not be deprived due to the coordinated actions of the countries concerned. Therefore, officials believe that the current negotiations are progressing satisfactorily and that the countries concerned will soon be able to reach a compromise.

### Northern Spanish Government Troops Defeated

Retreat to Second Line of Defense

⊙Bilbao - Mount Lemoa, an important location on the Biscayan front line, was recently captured by government troops. After a fierce battle, it has now been retaken by the Nationalist forces. The Nationalist forces had previously dispatched a large squadron of airplanes to bomb the government troops' positions, followed by heavy artillery bombardment of the Basque army. Under the cover of this aircraft and heavy artillery, the Nationalist forces then charged with fifteen tanks, followed by infantry. The government troops fought back with machine guns, and the fighting was very fierce. Although the Nationalist forces advanced like a tide, the government troops' machine gun fire was unstoppable. Later, Nationalist reinforcements arrived and continued to attack bravely. The government troops were finally unable to resist due to the lack of weapons to attack the tanks and had to retreat to the second line of defense. They later made two counterattacks, but both were unsuccessful. (Central News Agency, 6th, Reuters)

### New Japanese Finance Minister Kaya Pays Respects to the Spirits of Takahashi and Fujii

[Tokyo] Yesterday was Sunday, and with the fresh greenery reflected in the colorful clouds and the weather exceptionally clear, the new Finance Minister Kaya visited Tama Mausoleum in the afternoon. After reporting his new appointment and paying respects, the Finance Minister drove from Asakawa to Tama Cemetery to pay tribute to the spirits of the late Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo and Mr. Fujii Shinobu, who sacrificed themselves for the emergency finances. After Kaya got out of the car, silence fell all around. He walked on the gravel stones until he reached the tombstone, where he saw the tombstone of the late Mr. Fujii, weathered by wind and rain, evoking a sense of loneliness. Kaya offered flowers and incense in front of the tomb and meditated for several minutes. The late Finance Minister Fujii sacrificed his life for the sake of the huge budget. "Fujii is truly a person to be sympathized with," Kaya murmured. He then offered a long prayer. Kaya, welcoming the three great ministers, Takahashi, Baba, and Yuki, rose from bureau chief to vice minister and then to minister, sharing the exact same position as Fujii at the time. Inevitably, he felt the tides of the times and fate in his heart. When he arrived at the tomb of Takahashi, Kaya's eyes were already filled with tears. This was the intersecting and complex expression of Kaya as an ordinary person and Kaya as the Finance Minister. Kaya, as a bureau chief, personally witnessed the deaths of the two ministers, Fujii and Takahashi. Naturally, he was filled with mixed emotions regarding this tragic sacrifice. What remains now is the huge budget, the emergency finances, and the stability of the people's lives. The above matters constantly flashed in Kaya's mind. (7th, Domei News)

### Populace of Chahar Province Rises in Self-Defense

The populace of Chongli, Zhangbei, and Nanhaogou rises in succession. A certain special agency is planning how to cope with the situation.

Wanquan Telegram: Since Bai Changziyi of the bandit puppet army in Chahar Province led his troops to revolt from Baimiaotan, the morale of the military and the people in various parts of Chahar Province has been exceptionally unstable. The people of Chahar have been subjected to abuse by puppet bandits for more than two years, from the 24th year [of the Republic] to the present. Coupled with exorbitant taxes and the destruction of education and culture, this year's weather has been severely dry, and no crops have been sown. Scarlet fever is prevalent, and the death of livestock and people is also serious. Under such natural disasters and man-made calamities, and the oppressive government and harsh taxes, the people can no longer endure the oppression. The saying that "when things reach an extreme, they will revert" is only natural. Moreover, since Bai Changziyi's troops revolted, a certain party has become increasingly distrustful of the puppet bandit army, and its exploitation of the people has become even more severe, hence this widespread upheaval. Currently, the Chahar puppet bandits are disintegrating, and the people are rising in self-defense, which is driven by the trend of the times. The details of the changes and the measures taken by a certain special agency are described below:

The Situation of People's Self-Defense in Chahar

Taozhimiao Village in Chongli County is a very populous place. Located in the southern part of the county, 25 miles from Wanquan County, it has a puppet Public Security Bureau, with dozens of policemen. On the evening of the first of this month, Zhao, a villager, gathered more than a hundred righteous people and launched a surprise attack at night. They killed the puppet Public Security Bureau chief and confiscated their weapons. The villagers then publicly elected Zhao as their leader and declared the village independent. On the second day, all grain merchants and vehicles passing through the village were detained and inspected before being released in the afternoon.

The People of Zhangbei Follow Suit

On the same day, the people of Zhangbei and Nanhaogou also followed suit. Apart from Nanhaogou, for which there are no detailed reports yet, regarding the self-defense of the people of Zhangbei, according to people from Zhangbei, after the people launched the uprising, the Fourth Division of the puppet army of Bao Zichen, formerly stationed in Zhangbei, dispatched a unit to Duolun to pursue Bai Changziyi's troops. A unit of about 400 people remained to guard the city, but they were surrounded and disarmed by the people. Six traitors were killed, and their heads were hung on the city gate as a warning.

Post-Incident Handling by Special Agencies

After the incident, the personnel of a certain party working in Chahar, as well as the puppet bandit army and their families, were extremely panicked. They fled to Jiabusi for days and sent their families to Rehe. The head of a certain special agency in Jiabusi urgently telegraphed Uedo, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and Watanabe, the chief of staff, two hours after the incident, reporting the situation and requesting instructions. He urgently requested that troops be sent from Rehe to Chahar to suppress the uprising. Soldiers were densely deployed around the special agency, closely guarded to prevent unforeseen events. The situation was serious, as if facing a formidable enemy. Airplanes flew between Chengde and Jiabusi incessantly, reportedly carrying important Mongolian puppet figures relaying information.

Large Numbers of Troops in Western Rehe Await Orders to Enter Chahar

Currently, a large number of troops from a certain party have arrived in western Rehe. It is reported that they will pass through Guyuan and enter Chahar. They are currently preparing for battle. Before the people's self-defense was launched, a certain party seemed to have heard something, but did not pay much attention. However, they tried their best to order the reduction of the direct line troops of the puppet army Li Shouxin, setting the limit at 3,000 people. They also ordered that the firearms of each unit, except those guarding the posts, be stored in the warehouse. The horses grazing in the pastures were also ordered to be herded back by the people. Furthermore, fearing that the puppet troops stationed on the front lines of Shangdu, Daqinggou, and Nanhaogou in western Chahar would develop emotional ties with the National Army over time, they ordered the rear stationed troops to exchange defenses with them, in order to prevent problems from gradually arising. Unexpectedly, this unexpected blow occurred during the process, so their panic reached its peak.

Those Responsible for Inciting the Uprising

It is reported that Kangbao County will also launch an uprising in this Chahar civil unrest. The parties responsible for inciting this uprising are purely a certain party. Recently, a certain party planned to conduct a meticulous survey of the people's property, livestock numbers, and population age, preparing to implement strict controls. When the people of Chahar heard the news, and after witnessing a certain party's exorbitant taxes and cruel atrocities in the past, they all believed that their lives and property would be completely controlled by them in the future, and they would inevitably face the fear of losing both property and life. Instead of waiting for death sooner or later, it is better to struggle as much as possible before death, hoping to gain a glimmer of life among the nine deaths.

### Investigation of Deaths from Drought in Western Henan

More Than One Million Disaster Victims in Eight Counties

Zhengzhou Telegram: The drought in western Henan is extremely severe. Starving people cannot find food, and deaths continue to occur. The number of people fleeing famine is also increasing day by day. In order to maintain social order and prevent local unrest, the authorities have ordered all counties to try to persuade and prevent people from leaving the area. As for the disaster situation in each county, according to the investigation, it is as follows: ㊀ Xin'an: More than 150,000 disaster victims, more than 700 deaths. Tragedies such as exchanging children for food and mutual killings have occurred recently. ㊁ Yanshi: More than 300,000 disaster victims, more than 40,000 people who cannot survive without relief, more than 250 deaths. ㊂ Dengfeng: More than 204,400 disaster victims, more than 32,000 fugitives, more than 350 deaths from starvation. ㊃ Linru: More than 150,000 disaster victims, more than 700 deaths. ㊄ Shan County: More than 173,000 disaster victims, more than 3,400 deaths. ㊅ Luoyang: More than 300,000 disaster victims, 256 deaths. ㊆ Mianchi: More than 120,000 disaster victims, 272 deaths. ㊇ Lingbao: More than 160,000 disaster victims, 523 deaths. The trend of selling people is particularly rampant in this county. It is reported that the price of young girls is only ten or twenty yuan.

### Establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Government Committee

New Directors of Two Departments Have Taken Office; The Scope of the Construction Department Is Greatly Reduced

Guangzhou Telegram: The reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Government has been officially announced. Wang Yingyu, member of the previous Provincial Government Committee and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Liu Weichi, member of the Provincial Committee and Director of the Department of Construction, have been dismissed. Chairman Wu Tiecheng concurrently serves as the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Xu Jingtang serves as the Director of the Department of Construction. Xu Chongqing, Director of the Department of Education, and Song Ziliang, Director of the Department of Finance, remain in their positions. The current Provincial Government Committee was officially established on the 2nd of this month. At about 9:00 AM that morning, Wu Tiecheng and Xu Jingtang arrived at the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Construction to take over their duties. Then, at 10:00 AM, they convened all members of the Provincial Committee and held the first meeting in the Provincial Government Conference Hall, resolving five items related to various departments. After Wu concurrently assumed the position of Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, his sole policy is to carry out rural production and construction. On the one hand, he will allocate a large sum of money saved from the provincial treasury to rural construction expenses. On the other hand, he will continue to consult with the banking community in Shanghai to make investments. In recent days, he has ordered the Provincial Government Design Committee to quickly draft a rural construction plan and submit it for approval in order to implement it. As for the administrative commissioners of various districts and the county magistrates of various counties, they are actually being directly trained by the central government. They have been going to Beijing in batches for training in the past month, so there is no need to change the personnel of the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. Since Xu Jingtang took over as the Director of the Department of Construction, most of the original agencies directly under the Construction Department have been merged separately or separated independently. Therefore, he has not yet started drafting new construction plans. One reason is that the Provincial Industrial Management Office will soon separate from the Construction Department and be changed to the Industrial Management Committee, directly under the Provincial Government. The Highway Management Office has also been established and changed to be directly under the Provincial Government. The main agencies under the jurisdiction of the Construction Department have been completely lost. In the future, the Construction Department will only have the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Silk Bureau and the Rural Bureau, and what they handle are all technical design matters. Therefore, the reorganization policy of the Construction Department in the future will only be planned from the above three bureaus. Compared with the previous government affairs of the Construction Department, it will be more leisurely. The expenses of the Construction Department will also be reduced accordingly in the future. (June 3rd)

### Continued Report on the Lixin Labor Strike

Five Measures Agreed Upon; Workers Clash with Military Police

Wuxi Telegram: The labor strike at the Lixin Textile Dyeing and Finishing Factory in this city was reported yesterday. It is now learned that five measures have been agreed upon regarding the improvement of workers' treatment: ㊀ Weaving wages will be increased according to the wage rate of the 11th year [of the Republic]. ㊁ Spinning workers' wages will be moderately increased by the factory. ㊂ Regarding fines, the county government will supervise the factory to formulate new lenient standards for fines. ㊃ Those who have worked for two years will be allowed to withdraw their stored wages; those who jump factories are not subject to this limit. ㊄ The request of the mechanics to increase wages or Sunday wages will be changed to moderately increase wages. Towards 8:00 PM that evening, a group of workers went to the factory and clashed with the military police stationed at the factory. The workers intended to swarm into the factory. The military police stationed at the factory fired shots into the air as a warning for defense purposes. A repair worker named Li Xiugen, who was repairing the Wuqiao bridge, was shot and injured. All the workers then retreated. At that time, five policemen arrived at the factory for a shift change. Unexpectedly, they were spotted by the workers, who surrounded the police and vented their anger by attacking them. They were thrown into the Huishang Bridge River one by one. The police chief, He Yuliang, drowned because he did not know how to swim. The rest swam away. The Second District Commissioner's Office and the County Government, after finding out that there were unscrupulous elements who were not workers mixed in this labor unrest, immediately ordered the police bureau and district office to conduct a census of the security and household system in the factory area, and strictly arrest and interrogate them. The police bureau, upon receiving the order, arrested more than 20 people near the factory on the morning of the 7th. They will be severely punished according to the law. On the one hand, the county government posted notices in the factory area to persuade the workers to resume work. However, at the time of work, the workers still did not enter the factory to work. Currently, the Party and government are still making every effort to persuade the workers to resume work.

### Songjiang

### Yangzhou

Boat Capsizes, Two Drown

The Zhenyi Jiang ferry boat of the Yangzi Company, which was traveling from Zhenjiang to Jiangyin, collided with a passenger boat at Shatou Town, Jiangdu, at about 9:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, capsizing it. All four passengers on the boat fell into the water. Two people were rescued, and the rest drifted away with the waves.

Dispute Over Water Conservancy, Injury, Request for Examination

In the Xujiaqiao area of Jiangdu District 9, this year's wheat harvest was disappointing, and disputes over water conservancy needed for the autumn harvest are particularly intense. Yesterday (the 5th), Xu Cao, a 62-year-old farmer from Xianrenzhang in that area, because her field and Zhang Ren'an's field were separated by only one ridge, both used the Zhujia Mingtang water conservancy. The water passed through Xu's field and then entered Zhang's field. Now, Xu's field has not yet been cultivated, and Zhang has released water, resulting in a conflict. Zhang pushed her into the water and injured her head and legs. She has specially requested the Jiangdu District Inspection Office to examine the injuries and file a lawsuit for injury. After examining the injuries, the prosecutor ordered her to return home for self-treatment and wait for the summon to interrogate the perpetrator.

### Nanhui

A Foreigner Peddles Poisonous Candy

At about 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, a foreigner arrived in Datuan Town, District 8, carrying a type of strong candy medicine. The leaflet stated that it had nourishing and quit-smoking properties and was peddling it in the town. The patrol officer Zhou Fuchen of the police station in the town learned about it and took the person to the station. One type of strong candy was handed over to Dr. Pan Ganlin of the town for chemical examination. It seemed to contain poisonous substances. The fifteen large and small packages of strong candy, together with the person, were escorted to the county police bureau for disposal. According to the person, his name is Tokumitsu Jotaro, he has been residing in China for seventeen years, and he currently resides on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai.

### Changshu

Playing with Bullets, Injured

The son of Jiangbei cart driver Zhu San, named Xiaoxizi, is twelve years old this year. He is from Jiangbei and lives an exceptionally difficult life. Xiaoxizi goes out every day to pick up rags and paper to help the family make a living. Yesterday, Xiaoxizi picked up a rifle bullet outside, recognized it as a treasure, and took it home and took it out to play with. Unexpectedly, due to excessive tapping, the powder inside the bullet exploded, and the bullet head flew out, destroying both hands. Three fingers of the left hand were lost, and the head was also severely injured. He was sent to the county hospital for treatment.

### Changzhou

Cocoon Merchants' Purchases Are Not Prosperous

The cocoon merchants in Wuyi County have been weighing and purchasing cocoons for five or six days. On the 6th, the goods arriving at Niutangqiao and Chenduqiao were slightly more, with each merchant purchasing more than a hundred loads. The prices were between fifty-five and sixty yuan. The goods arriving at Donghenglin and Qishuyan were average, and the prices were slightly lower than before. In Banshang and Mahangqiao, due to competition for purchases, the prices have been raised, breaking the sixty-yuan barrier. Near Jiaoxi in the northern countryside, there are still many goods arriving. Due to inconvenient transportation, the prices are around fifty yuan. It is heard that the reason why the spring cocoons arriving this year are not prosperous is that the Jiangsu Construction Department is running cooperative cocoon drying in the Changyi area, and the Farmers Bank is lending cocoon funds, so farmers can dry the cocoons and wait for the price to sell them. Moreover, due to the general situation, the silkworm cocoons enter the market at different times. Recently, there are still silkworms that are in the late stages of sleep and feeding, and those that are currently in the soil clusters. Therefore, the date of cocoon collection must be extended by five or six days compared to the previous practice.

### Zhenjiang

Regulations on Fresh Cocoon Prices

The Construction Department believes that the spring fresh cocoons this year are about to enter the market. It is sincerely concerned that cocoon merchants in various places will arbitrarily suppress prices, which will harm the farmers' investment. It has specially stipulated standard prices. For improved fresh cocoons of excellent quality, the regulations should be followed, and the price should not be lower than thirty-seven yuan per load on the market scale. As for native fresh cocoons, the regulations of the Silkworm Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Council must also be followed, and the price should not be less than twenty-five yuan per load, so that the interests of both farmers and merchants can be guaranteed. In addition to instructing the various improved areas, the department has also ordered the county governments to instruct the cocoon merchants to comply.

### Jiading

Thefts Occur Frequently in the Southeast Countryside

At midnight on the 4th, at the home of Zhou Xianting in Xujiakou, a dozen or so bandits, armed with pistols, wooden sticks, iron rulers, and flashlights, broke into the house, tied up Zhou's young child, and burned his lower body with four foreign candles, forcing him to reveal the location of the silver. They finally robbed more than sixty yuan in legal tender, gold and silver jewelry, and clothes. Also, at Zhoujiazha, about five miles south of that place, on the night of May 31, the five families of Zhu Zhanxiang, Zhu Hexiang, Zhu Kuixiang, Zhu Jinsheng, and Zhu Xizhong were robbed by bandits similar to the previous ones, with losses numbering several tens of yuan.

### Shaoxing

Reorganization of the Security Police Force

The Shaoxing Provincial Security Force will be reorganized into a Security Police Force. It has been decided that the reorganization will be completed before the 20th.

The fishing areas of Yipan, Kanmen, and Jiguanshan, etc., in Yuhuan County, adjacent to Taizhou, are currently experiencing prosperous fishing, and there is an urgent need for salt. They should be allocated salt from the Chumen North Salt Field. Unexpectedly, the "outside pond salt production area" of the field has not produced much due to the cloudy and rainy weather this spring, which is not enough to meet the allocation.

### Peixian

Foot-Bound Women Fined

Since the implementation of the foot-binding abolition movement in this county, it has been actively promoted with no effort spared. It has recently been learned that Ms. Xu Kaixia, the foot-binding abolition instructor, has been going to various townships and towns to conduct inspections in recent days. According to what she said, there are many who have obeyed the order to liberate [their feet] in the townships she has inspected. However, there are also many who stubbornly refuse to release them even after the deadline. Such deliberate stubbornness is extremely detrimental to the ban. Therefore, according to Article 10 of the Foot-Binding Abolition Movement Regulations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, all women who have not yet released their feet are listed and presented to the county, and a fine of one yuan per household is imposed as a warning. It has been learned that there are still as many as sixteen households with foot-bound women, all of which have been presented to the County Party Headquarters and forwarded to the County Government for investigation and punishment according to the law.

### Bengbu

Commutation for Grain Collection

The Fengyang County Government, believing that grain storage is an important policy for famine preparedness, has stipulated a method for allocating grain based on land acreage in preparation for famine. In order to jointly plan and estimate, it has no choice but to commute the collection. It is now learned that the collection of the 24th, 5th, and 6th years will be merged, and one liter of grain will be collected per mu [Chinese acre], with those under thirty mu being exempt from collection, in order to show compassion.

### Hefei

Provincial Granaries Changed to County Management

Anhui is a rice-producing area. In order to adjust the countryside and store grain for famine prevention, the Provincial Government has initiated the establishment of provincial granaries, county granaries, and branch granaries based on the amount of rice produced in each county, and has appointed management offices at all levels to preside over the matter, and has borrowed funds from the Central Farmers Bank, the China Bank, and the China Agricultural Loan Group to collect grain in order to be successful. The largest granary outside Hefei's East Gate, with a capacity of 100,000 shi [unit of dry measure], will also be established on July 1st. Because local banks have been established throughout the province, the Provincial Government has decided to abolish all provincial granary management offices starting from July 1, in order to save provincial expenses, and change to local banks in each county to take over the management. The Department of Finance and Construction will jointly form an Anhui granary inspection team with the local banks in the next few days and go to the county granaries to inspect them, so that they can be accepted at the due date. The Hefei Granary has recently received this order.

Military Police Capture Four Bandits

In Tianjia'an Town, the northern terminus of the Huainan Railway along the Huai River, four bandits suddenly came to the town from Bengbu on a small boat on the evening of the 3rd and stayed at the Binhuai Hotel, planning to rob the Huainan train and matters in the town. A waiter heard about it and paid special attention to it. Before long, the four bandits went to the roof, intending to go out and rob. The hotel urgently reported to the Huainan Road Garrison Military Police Team stationed in the town. The team urgently dispatched more than a dozen soldiers armed with weapons to arrest them. The four bandits did not resist and were tied up and taken out. The hotel immediately searched the four bandits' luggage and found two pistols and more than twenty bullets, which were turned over to the military police for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, at this time, two of the four bandits suddenly drew their pistols and fired at the military police. The military police also returned fire, and after more than ten minutes of fierce fighting, two bandits with guns fled, and one bandit without a gun also broke free and escaped, but was chased out and captured on the main road. Until dawn (the 4th), the two bandits with guns were captured at the Bengtian small boat pier. In this battle, three or four military policemen were shot and injured. Due to the seriousness of the case, the four bandits were escorted by car to the Nanjing Military Police Headquarters for interrogation on the afternoon of the 4th.

### Excerpts from the Yunnan Journey (24)

— By 桮棬

After traveling 25 kilometers, we arrived in Changsha and first visited the Four Provinces Native Products Exhibition (Hunan, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi). We saw various items and samples, but there were no significant new inventions. However, compared to the era of the Nanyang Industrial Exposition, there was considerable progress. In the late afternoon, we arrived at Changsha Station of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and boarded a well-prepared second-class sleeping car. The train departed at 6:00 PM. The organization of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is quite rationalized, with few personnel and low expenses. Coal consumption is limited to 3.3 tons per 100 kilometers. Therefore, the coal and water added to the train in Zhuzhou were not replenished in Changsha. It was necessary to wait until Gaojiafang before removing coal ash, adding coal, and adding water. The locomotive had to be detached and reattached after the work was completed, which took about half an hour at Gaojiafang Station. After two hours, we passed the Miluo River bridge, which was solid and the scenery was charming. It was just when the new moon was rising, and the fishing boats on the river were lined up in rows. It was a pity that I couldn't capture a photograph. The train arrived in Yueyang at midnight, and the locomotive was detached, refilled with water, the ashes were removed, and coal was added, just like at Gaojiafang Station. This stop took about an hour. The second-class sleeping car we were riding in was recently shipped from England and today was its maiden voyage. The equipment on the car was even more refined and spacious than that of the first-class sleeping cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line. It will be put into service starting tomorrow. Originally, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway had very few locomotives and passenger and freight cars. Twenty-four locomotives and 400 freight cars were purchased the year before last. However, they are still insufficient. This year, another twenty-four locomotives and 400 passenger and freight cars were purchased. Due to a fire at the "孟却斯德" factory, the ordered cars could not be delivered on time. They are still arriving gradually in twos and threes. This car is one of the newly purchased ones. Currently, car prices in Europe are very expensive. For example, the large locomotive used in this train (480 tons) cost over 200,000 yuan when purchased the year before last. Now, it would cost over 300,000 yuan. Even a small locomotive cannot be obtained for less than 200,000 yuan at present. According to the railway bureau, if military transport is reduced, all matters can be adjusted. Currently, thousands of tons of goods are piled up at each station, and there are no cars to transport them. Therefore, business cannot be developed. Once the cars arrive, there is no doubt that it will improve daily.

On the 52nd day (May 26), at dawn, the train passed Puchi and Xianning. We arrived in Wuchang around 7:00 AM before noon. The East Station of Wuchang is at the riverbank. Unfortunately, the East Station is about ten li away from the riverbank. The corridor and pier have not yet been built. It is very inconvenient for pedestrians when it rains. This is because the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has not been fully opened for long, and the construction has not yet reached this point. It is heard that the joint operation of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will begin on Double Tenth Day this year. A train will depart from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, pass through the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, take the Nanping section (the Nanchang-Pingxiang section is expected to be completed in September), and arrive in Zhuzhou, entering the Guangdong-Hankou line to reach Guangzhou. It is believed that the opening of traffic between Hangzhou and Guangzhou is not far off.

My travelogue ends with this morning. Finally, regarding my overall impressions, I will add four points as a small conclusion to the Yunnan-Guizhou supplementary notes.

㊀ This long journey lasted 50 days, covering 11,000 li. The entire group maintained a very focused and unremitting spirit. In particular, Chief Chu Minyi, despite his advanced age, was constantly in motion wherever we went. He gave speeches at every welcoming event and participated in entertainment events. He wrote in his diary every night before going to bed. He also responded to requests for calligraphy from various places. His hard work and enthusiasm were beyond the reach of ordinary people. Furthermore, Chief Secretary Xue Cixin meticulously handled the transportation and accommodation arrangements for the entire group. The assistance of Zhang Yanxiang, Wang Shiqi, and others, along with the care of Mr. Hu Shiquan of the travel agency, ensured that the entire group praised the success of this trip in terms of logistics. Mr. Xue deserves the credit. Over the past 20 years, I have participated in numerous group tours in Europe and China, but this is the only time I have seen such progress in the discipline, order, and self-governance of the entire group. In particular, the common sense of the colleagues was sufficient to consult and learn from each other, making this trip worthwhile.

㊁ The itinerary and schedule prepared before the departure of the group were mostly consumed by travel, food, lodging, and social engagements. It was not possible to have sufficient research and detailed deliberation on any matter. If colleagues are to be assigned the responsibility of investigation and research, I am afraid that a pleasant answer cannot be given. I ask the people of the country not to have excessive expectations for the return of colleagues.

㊂ The highways through Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces, although built with slightly different motivations, are all crystallizations of the blood and sweat of the people. For example, the Guizhou-Sichuan Road project required not only the conscription of hundreds of thousands of laborers, but also the recruitment of 5,000 specialized stonemasons from North China, who were organized into teams and came south to work on mountain clearing. Within three years, more than half of these 5,000 stonemasons died from illness. And among the local laborers, due to the lack of drinking water and the spread of infectious diseases, the number of deaths was in the tens of thousands. We are used to hearing the call to advance by treading on the blood of the martyrs. Now, after passing through this broad road, we should change the slogan to "Advance by treading on the blood and sweat of the ancestors." In the future, the bronze statues built on the highways should not be dedicated to imposing figures, but those with unkempt hair and emaciated bodies should be placed in the first position.

㊃ The welcoming and provision arrangements in the various places we passed through consumed an immeasurable amount of mental and material resources. Except for Guangxi Province, farming was suspended in the fields, work was suspended in the factories, and young students were suspended from school. Where will this loss be compensated from? All of this is due to the local officials' excessive eagerness for quick success, disregarding the suffering of the people and focusing solely on their own performance evaluation. Because of these cosmetic embellishments, although we have eaten sumptuous banquets and heard flattering words, we still have a few unpleasant things to say. This is nothing more than the dictates of conscience. I sincerely hope that in the future, whether it is a tour or an inspection, it is not appropriate to notify the local authorities in advance for preparations. We should avoid repeating the old bureaucratic practice of causing hardship to the people and wasting money. This, then, is a sentiment that all colleagues wish to express. (The End)

### The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Has Received Approval to Lay Double Tracks Between Shanghai and Suzhou

Borrowing 800,000 Pounds from the Sino-British Consortium to Purchase Materials

The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, in order to improve the efficiency of the Beijing-Shanghai line, added double tracks on both ends. After completion, the travel time has been reduced considerably. Now, due to the heavy congestion of passengers between Shanghai and Suzhou, it is planned to add double tracks to facilitate traffic. The Ministry of Railways has approved the project, which covers approximately 60 kilometers and requires hundreds of thousands of yuan. A loan of 800,000 pounds has been obtained from the Sino-British Consortium, part of which will be used to purchase materials such as sleepers and steel rails. The loan agreement was signed in Beijing some days ago. Purchase orders will be placed abroad according to the material purchase list. At the same time, tenders will be invited for the earthwork project. It is reported that the Bureau hopes to complete the project within the year. The remaining funds will be used for other railway improvement projects.

### Both Railways Will Implement Lower Passenger Fares Starting July 1st

1.25 Fen Per Kilometer; Application to Reduce Freight Rates Submitted for Approval

The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, with the approval of the Ministry of Railways, will implement lower passenger fares starting July 1st. The measures to reduce freight rates have also been submitted to the Ministry for approval and will be announced and implemented after approval. The original passenger fares for both railways were: (1) Beijing-Shanghai section: 1.5 fen per kilometer for third class for the first 20 kilometers; 1.25 fen per kilometer for third class for 21-100 kilometers; 1.125 fen per kilometer for third class for 101-200 kilometers; 1.0125 fen per kilometer for third class for 201-400 kilometers. (2) Shanghai-Hangzhou section: 4.05 fen per kilometer for first class; 2.7 fen per kilometer for second class; 1.35 fen per kilometer for third class; 0.8 fen for fourth class. (3) Cao-Ning section: 4.05 fen per kilometer for first class; 2.7 fen per kilometer for second class; 1.35 fen per kilometer for third class; 0.7 fen for fourth class. The new passenger fares approved by the Ministry are: 1.25 fen per kilometer for third class for the first 50 kilometers; a 10% reduction (i.e., 1.125 fen) per kilometer for third class for 51-100 kilometers; a 20% reduction (i.e., 1 fen) per kilometer for third class for 101-200 kilometers; a 30% reduction (i.e., 0.875 fen) per kilometer for third class for 201-400 kilometers. Thereafter, the fares for the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Cao-Ning sections will be calculated according to the above standards. Second-class fares will be double third-class fares, and first-class fares will be 50% higher than second-class fares (i.e., a 1, 2, 3 system). Fourth-class fares will be set at 0.6 fen per kilometer for the first 50 kilometers, and above 51 kilometers will also be calculated according to the third-class calculation method, with proportional reductions.

### Sino-French Wireless Telephone Trial

According to Xu Zhiyi, this matter will be resolved soon. Although the opponents have made many demands, the main one is to increase the production and sales quota, and the number is being negotiated. Representatives from Guangdong Province have come to Shanghai to discuss the establishment of a branch and have met once. They are now going to Beijing and Hangzhou for investigation and will return to Shanghai within days to have detailed discussions, after which a decision can be made.

### The Statement That the Reorganization of Guangxi Province's Finances Will Be Carried Out in Four Steps Is Inaccurate

According to the Central News Agency, reports in recent days regarding the reorganization of Guangxi Province's finances have been clarified by the Ministry of Finance. Some ten days ago, Huang Ji, President of the Guangxi Provincial Bank, came on behalf of the provincial government to discuss the reorganization of Guangxi banknotes, reporting on the number of banknotes issued by the bank and the content of the reserve fund. He requested the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to investigate first. The so-called four-step plan reported in the newspapers is not a fact.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Signed a Draft Agreement with HSBC to Reorganize Old Debts

The Ministry Appoints a Commissioner to Sign the Contract; Debts Reduced to 10 Million Yuan

After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was brought under state ownership, a debt reorganization committee was formed due to the excessive accumulated old debts over the years. All smaller creditors have been consulted and cleared one after another. Regarding the old debts owed to the British HSBC Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications have agreed with the bank. As of the end of August 1936, the accumulated principal and interest amounted to approximately 14 million yuan in national currency, which has been reduced to 10 million yuan in national currency. The plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan. A down payment of 1.5 million yuan in cash will be made, and the remaining 8.5 million yuan will be paid with 17 promissory notes issued by the Central Trust Bureau, each worth 500,000 yuan. At the same time, the bank will hand over the old debt collateral of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the Central Trust Bureau. The promissory notes will be guaranteed by the Bank of China, with the first payment due at the end of May this year, and subsequent payments made annually, calculated at 4% weekly interest. A draft contract for the above plan has been signed. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications have appointed Lu Hanqin and Ha Shumin, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of HSBC Bank, to formally sign the contract. After the formal contract is signed, payments will begin. Lu Hanqin and others are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Beijing tonight.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Increase Ship Service to Amoy and the Philippines

Currently Looking for Suitable Ocean-Going Vessels

In response to the request of overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Communications previously ordered the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to open a route from Amoy to the Philippines. After the Haiheng was deployed to the Shanghai-Guangdong-Hong Kong route in March of this year, overseas Chinese embraced patriotism and switched to taking Chinese ships. As a result, the business has flourished in just a few months. The Bureau, seeing that the business on the route has made considerable progress and that one Haiheng vessel is insufficient, has added another vessel to operate back and forth. It is reported that the vessel is being sought, and detailed negotiations will be carried out for leasing or purchasing it.

### National Goods Manufacturers Competition and Exhibition Postponed to the 18th

Over 80 Companies Have Participated; There Is Still Space Available

The National Goods Manufacturers Competition and Exhibition in Shanghai, originally scheduled to open on the 10th of this month, has been postponed to the 18th of this month due to insufficient preparation time. The details are as follows:

Notice of Postponement

The association announced yesterday: "To whom it may concern, this association is organized to promote the spirit of products and expand production and sales. Since the start of registration, the participation of manufacturers has been very enthusiastic. The original opening date was set for the 10th of this month, but the participating manufacturers believe that the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and staff members are busy. Opening after the festival would not only allow for more time to arrange the venue but also benefit the promotion prospects as the weather gradually warms. This consensus is not without merit. Therefore, we hereby announce that the construction of the association's venue will begin on the 8th of this month, the booths will be drawn on the 15th, and the official opening will be on the 18th. There are still some booths available, so participation should be expedited."

Enthusiastic Registration

Since the start of registration, the participation of manufacturers has been very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, over 80 companies have participated, including Sino-French Pharmacy, Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Huadong Woolen Mill, Jiuxin Enamel Factory, Welfare Hat Factory, China Oil Lamp Factory, Double Wheel Toothbrush Factory, Shixin Leather Factory, Guangsan Changyun Yarn Factory, Meili Tie Company, Meifeng Glove Factory, Tongfengyong Children's Clothing Factory, Baili Chemical Products Factory, Zhenchuan Embroidery Factory, Fucheng Shoe Factory, Zhongxing Knitting Factory, and Xinsheng Underwear Factory, occupying about 100 booths. However, the association's venue has a total of 150 booths, so there are still some available. National goods manufacturers are welcome to participate enthusiastically.

### Gu Xinyi Discusses the National Rice Observation Group

Gu Was Unable to Participate Due to Shanghai Affairs; Grain Production and Sales Company to Be Discussed

The National Rice Observation Group initiated by the Anhui Provincial Government and the Anhui Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been in preparation for over a month. The scope of the group includes provinces and cities such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Hunan, and Hubei. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce had recommended Mr. Gu Xinyi, a rice merchant, as its representative to participate in the departure. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency interviewed Mr. Gu yesterday, who stated that he was unable to participate due to busy affairs in Shanghai. The group will gather in Wuhu for departure, and the observation period will be about two months, focusing on the production and sale of rice in various regions. Therefore, it will visit Hong Kong, Guangdong, Beijiang, Xijiang, Shantou, Macau, Changsha, and Fujian to inspect the rice situation and market conditions. Cao Yumin of the Shanghai Grain Association is currently in Wuhu and may join the observation group at that time. Furthermore, it has been learned that the grain merchants of the above six provinces and cities are planning to form a grain production and sales company with a capital of 2 million yuan to regulate the surplus and deficiency of food and improve rice. However, the company is still in the planning stage. Concrete implementation will occur after the National Rice Observation Group returns, and all matters are discussed.

### Report on the National Products Association's Delegation's Visit to the Handicraft Exhibition

The Shanghai United National Products Movement Association, considering the grand scale of the Capital Handicraft Exhibition and its comprehensive collection of national handicraft products, which greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, sent Chu Yaohuan to visit the exhibition for observation and research. Chu has now returned to Shanghai and reported that, overall, the quality and techniques of all the exhibits have significantly improved. The most significant aspects of this exhibition are as follows: ㊀ Products from various provinces and cities are usually rarely circulated. This exhibition provides an opportunity for mutual exchange, research, and improvement. After the exhibition closes, each province and city can introduce products from other provinces and cities that are not available in their own, to promote inter-provincial economic exchange. ㊁ Exhibitors can understand consumers' psychology and preferences for the first time. This exhibition allows them to observe which products sell the most and which are sluggish, providing a basis for improvement or adjustment. ㊂ Nanjing, as the capital, houses central government agencies related to agriculture and industry, such as the Central Industrial Testing Institute and the Central Agricultural Testing Field, all led by experts with extensive knowledge and experience. This exhibition provides an opportunity for representatives from various provinces and cities to have their products reviewed by experts and discuss methods for improvement. ㊃ The collection of exhibits covers a wide range of regions, including remote provinces such as Yunnan, Xikang, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Guizhou, Chahar, and others. This exhibition provides an opportunity to discuss with the central government how to develop transportation, reduce freight costs, and eliminate excessive taxes to alleviate the burden on merchants. The central government, with its wise and capable officials, will undoubtedly strive to meet the expectations of representatives from various provinces and cities within its capabilities. Furthermore, the display of products from the occupied areas of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Rehe serves as a reminder to the nation and fosters the determination to recover lost territories.

### Qingdao Industrial Observation Group to Arrive in Shanghai Today from Hangzhou

The nine-member industrial observation group organized by the Qingdao Branch of the China Industrial Federation, led by Chairman Guo Cizhang, arrived in Shanghai on the 26th. After visiting major factories, they went to Hangzhou the day before yesterday for similar observations. It is now known that the group will stay in Hangzhou for about two days and then return to Shanghai today to continue observing renowned factories such as the Pudong China Alcohol Factory. They will then return to Qingdao via Nanjing and Jinan.

### Warning to Chinese Marine Engineers: Do Not Be Fooled by High Prices

Lured by High Prices to Work in Dalian: Marine Engineers' Association Has Urged Members to Resist

The coastal shipping industry has flourished this year, resulting in a phenomenon of having goods but no ships. Various shipping companies in Shanghai are actively purchasing new ocean vessels from abroad to meet the demand for cargo transport in coastal ports. Since freight rates have increased four times, shipping companies' revenues have greatly increased, and charter rates have also soared. For example, a 6,000-ton vessel that could be chartered for 12,500 yuan per month at this time last year can now fetch 45,000 yuan. The shipping industry is indeed entering a prosperous period. A certain foreign shipping company in Dalian, seeing the potential for high profits in Chinese coastal shipping, has recently added more than a dozen new vessels. Due to a shortage of marine engineers, they secretly sent representatives to Shanghai to hire Chinese marine engineers. However, since the number of unemployed marine engineers is very small, they plan to lure certificate holders for chief engineer and first engineer positions in various shipping companies with higher salaries of 320 yuan for chief engineers and 200 yuan for first engineers. The Marine Engineers' Association, fearing that its members may not understand the truth, has strictly ordered all members to refuse and not be fooled, even if it means unemployment. The Marine Engineers' Association has issued the following important notice: "Recently, various Chinese shipping companies have added new vessels and are hiring marine engineers through the Association. The Association has introduced all its unemployed members and is unable to supply more. All unregistered unemployed marine engineers are urged to register with the Association immediately for job placement, as it concerns their own interests. Do not delay. As for the news that a certain foreign shipping company plans to hire Chinese marine engineers with higher salaries, we urge you not to be fooled."

### Yan Xishan's Representative Li Hongwen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Severe Internal Conflict Among Bandit-Puppet Troops: Arrived to Negotiate Shanxi Loan

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Li Hongwen, the Taiyuan Pacification Director Yan Xishan's representative in Nanjing, accompanied by Bo Yongji, Yan's representative in Peiping, arrived in Shanghai by train at 7:00 AM yesterday. After disembarking, they rested at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road and then visited Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance, to discuss the issue of Shanxi's loan. A reporter interviewed Li at the hotel, and he revealed the following information:

Internal Conflict Among Bandits and Puppets

Li stated that he had no definitive reports regarding the military situation at the front lines, but he had learned that there was severe internal conflict among the bandit-puppet troops, with some wanting to surrender, but being monitored by certain factions. Many of the monitors had been killed, causing great concern. Our defenses are solid and the enemy will not succeed no matter when they attack.

Construction Loan

Li continued, stating that his trip to Shanghai was to negotiate a loan, which could be divided into two parts. One part is a construction loan, which the Shanxi provincial government will secure with public bonds from the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Bank of Jiangsu. Preliminary discussions have been held, and the loan amount is approximately 2-3 million yuan, but the exact amount has not yet been determined. The interest rate and repayment schedule are also subject to further negotiation. It is still difficult to say whether a final agreement can be reached during this trip.

Repairing Jin-Sui Railway

The other part is a loan for road construction, which will be secured by the operating revenue of the provincial Datong-Puzhou Railway for the construction of the Jin-Sui Railway, amounting to approximately 5 million yuan. All details are to be negotiated. When I was in Nanjing, I had to wait for Mr. Song (Ziwen) to return to Shanghai from Lushan as I did not know he had left for Lushan.

### Zhu Qinglan Discusses Experiences During the Northwest Disaster Inspection

Disaster Situation is Grievous and Unprecedented: Bones Exposed in the Wilderness, Cannibalism Occurs

Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 6th to discuss disaster relief measures with leaders from all walks of life. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency interviewed him and reported on his disaster inspection experience and relief measures as follows:

Disaster Inspection Experience

Zhu first stated that he departed from Shanghai on April 19th, passing through the provinces and cities of Sichuan, Henan, Guizhou, Gansu, and others, all the way to Jiayuguan outside Gansu and the provinces of Qinghai and Ningxia, lasting 47 days and traveling over 10,000 li. The severity of the disaster situation in various places was unprecedented in his decades of disaster relief. Bones were exposed everywhere, resembling the aftermath of a major war. Cannibalism was heard from time to time. Grass roots and tree bark had been stripped bare, and wild grass was also on the verge of extinction. Selling wives and children was openly bargained, and there were even those who hanged themselves due to unbearable hunger. The disaster situation in the Hexi area of Gansu was particularly severe. All the houses had been burned down due to years of bandit raids. Coupled with the droughts, locusts, and wind disasters this year, the dwellings were like ruins. The people were barely clothed, as if living in primitive times. If emergency relief is not provided, the situation will become even more unbearable.

Relief Situation

All provinces are actively carrying out emergency relief where they are. Cao Zhongzhi, a commissioner from the Ministry of Finance, is personally inspecting and providing relief in Sichuan Province. The provincial relief committee has also selected more than 130 inspection and relief chiefs, who have been personally instructed by Zhu. These chiefs are then divided into various counties, where each county selects ten inspection and relief workers to be trained before starting the inspection and relief work. However, due to the shortage of funds and the wide-spread disaster, it is necessary to carefully distinguish and ensure that those who cannot survive without relief are saved. Du Yannan, a commissioner, is in charge of relief in Gansu Province. Zhu has discussed with local gentry to distribute the funds according to the counties. Qinghai Province has suffered severe hail and military disasters, resulting in huge losses. The central government has only allocated 100,000 yuan, which is far from enough for relief. Later, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan to increase the relief funds for management. When Zhu was in Ningxia, he met with Chairman Ma Lin and briefly discussed relief work, focusing on immigration and cultivation. All relief work is under the responsibility of Sun Xianqing, the monitoring and relief commissioner. Emergency relief in Henan Province is also being carried out in order, and is now being actively managed by Tang Zongguo, Yang Zigong, Li Shaoduo, and Feng Yangshan.

Relief Measures

Zhu continued, stating that the relief measures for the disaster areas in various provinces have been formulated by the Relief Committee in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industry in two main points: ㊀ preventive relief and ㊁ fundamental relief. They have been submitted to this Tuesday's administrative meeting for discussion. If approved, they will be implemented. As for the 2.94 million yuan in debt notes and 2.01 million yuan in cash allocated by the Ministry of Finance to various provinces for relief, they have been remitted one after another for disaster relief. The establishment of shelters for disaster-stricken children in the disaster areas is urgent. During his inspection in the disaster areas, Zhu has been adopting stray children at any time, and there are already several thousand. However, there are too many disaster-stricken children, and it is necessary to implement large-scale measures. In addition to sending a telegram to the China Children's Welfare Association to actively carry out the work, Zhu is also trying to find ways to formulate measures for the shelters. The purpose is to provide food and basic knowledge that citizens should have, such as literacy, for a temporary period of one year.

Collective Discussion on Relief

The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Disaster Relief Association believes that the disaster victims in various provinces are in urgent need of relief. In addition to borrowing 300,000 yuan from the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Bank of Jiangsu to carry out emergency relief in various provinces, it has scheduled a meeting of the board of directors and executive committee at 4:00 PM on the 10th at the Renji Hall to discuss specific relief measures and conduct fundraising in order to collect a large amount of funds to be remitted to various disaster areas as soon as possible. Zhu Qinglan will report on the latest disaster situation in various provinces at the meeting and bring photos of the situation in various provinces for reference.

Sichuan Association Welcomes

The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association welcomed Zhu at a banquet at the Park Road Gongdelin yesterday noon to show their appreciation for his hard work in inspecting the disaster situation in various provinces. Those present included Zhu Qinglan, Li Qingfan, Tao Fuqing, Gu Chenliu, Zhang Shulin, Tang Dean, Ren Xingnan, Zheng Yushu, Yang Dequan, Li Zhaofu, Fan Mingqu, Bai Jian, and others, more than ten people. Li Qingfan delivered a welcome speech, stating that the association was welcoming General Zhu to thank him for his hard work and tireless efforts for the tens of millions of disaster victims. He was particularly concerned about the disaster situation in Sichuan Province. The disaster victims in Sichuan Province appreciated General Zhu's relief efforts and thorough planning, and hoped that he would visit Sichuan again in the near future to help the 30 million disaster victims escape from suffering. He was representing the disaster victims of the province to make a request. Zhu delivered a reply speech, stating that he did not deserve the welcome, and that disaster relief was something he should do. He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from the gentlemen of the Sichuan Province.

### The Anti-Smuggling Movement Association Sets Up a Tip Box, Welcome Reports

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee, in order to thoroughly eliminate smuggling and punish unscrupulous merchants who seek personal gain by selling smuggled goods, has decided to set up a tip box in the First Special District Citizens' Federation at the northern end of Tianhou Palace Bridge to welcome reports from citizens in order to expose the inside stories, publicize them to the society, and impose strict sanctions. The association will strictly keep the names of the informants confidential. It hopes that the aim is to save the national economy and revive the nation, and not to file false accusations based on grudges. The information should clearly state the name, address, and business address of the smuggler, the person's appearance, the type and quantity of goods, and the address of the departure and storage lines, so that it is easy to investigate.

### Temporary Shops in the City Center Register Enthusiastically

### Land and House Tax for Cross-Border Road Construction to be Shared Equally Between Landlords and Tenants

The Real Estate Association Discusses and Sends Staff to Investigate Before Negotiating

The Shanghai Real Estate Association believes that the municipal authorities plan to collect land and house tax for cross-border road construction, with landlords and tenants each bearing half of the burden, which is related to the interests of landlords. Therefore, at 4:00 PM yesterday, the 13th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees was held at the association's office on Shanxi Road. Shen Tianhua, Shen Lianfang, Shen Jixuan, Li Bohan, Xu Xiajun, and others were present, with Shen Lianfang chairing the meeting and Shi Cizhou recording the minutes. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, the proposal to collect land and house tax for cross-border road construction, with landlords and tenants each bearing half of the burden, was discussed. It was decided that Shi Cizhou would be sent to investigate the actual situation, and another meeting would be held to discuss the matter. A notice would be sent to the relevant members to report the situation within ten days so that negotiations could be conducted. The letter to the members reads as follows: "Regarding the collection of land and house tax for cross-border road construction, with landlords and tenants each bearing half of the burden, the northern district has already implemented it, while the western district has not fully complied. The association considers this issue to be significant and has sent staff to conduct a thorough investigation. Members are requested to provide detailed feedback on their experiences and whether such events have occurred in their area within ten days for summary review and handling."

### The China Farmers Bank and Pudong Bank Jointly Offer Agricultural Warehouse Loans

Five Locations to be Established First, including Zhoupu and Datuan: Provisional Loan Amount of One Million Yuan

The China Farmers Bank, recognizing the vastness and abundance of agricultural products in Pudong, has partnered with the Pudong Bank to establish joint warehouses in Pudong to assist in agricultural recovery. In addition to the original Zhoupu First and Second Warehouses of Pudong Bank, which will be merged into a joint warehouse, four new warehouses will be built in Xinchang, Datuan, Qingcun, and Fengxing. The total number of warehouses will be six, and the provisional loan amount will be 1 million yuan in national currency. The China Farmers Bank will be responsible for 60%, or 600,000 yuan, and the Pudong Bank will be responsible for 40%, or 400,000 yuan. If necessary, the number of warehouses and the loan amount will be gradually increased in the future.

The authorities of the two banks have recently visited the above locations to determine suitable sites for warehouse construction. The design and construction have been completed and will be completed before the autumn harvest this year. After that, farmers in Pudong will be able to store their agricultural products and borrow loans at any time, avoiding the manipulation of merchants and the suffering of price cuts. This will greatly benefit the farmers.

### The One-Day Income Promotion Association Re-Urges the Closure of Donations

Solved Through Mediation by Party, Government, and Police: Military Police Stationed at the Factory Completely Withdraw

### Executive Yuan Issues Order Requiring Telephone Charges to be Paid According to Regulations

To be Implemented Starting Next Month

The Executive Yuan believes that government, military, and police agencies in various places often use telephones without paying the telephone bills, which has a significant impact on the telecommunications administration.

It also notified various agencies to be informed.

### Tax Bureau Refutes Luxin Tobacco Factory's Announcement

Revealing the Truth about British American Tobacco's Stamp Exemption

The Dagong News Agency reports: Regarding the dispute between Luxin Tobacco Factory and the Tax Bureau over alleged stamp tax evasion, which has been ongoing for some time, the factory recently issued an announcement stating that the factory owner discovered dozens of British American Tobacco Company's transportation permits in Pinghu, all without dates, months, and years, or stamp numbers, and bearing the words "Exempt from Inspection." Believing this to be tax evasion, they reported it to the Pinghu Police Bureau, which detained the aforementioned transportation permits and several dozen boxes of cigarettes. Yesterday, our reporter went to the Tax Bureau to inquire in detail. According to the person in charge of the Tax Bureau, after noticing this announcement in the newspaper, and because the case involved accusations of tax evasion and the detention of cigarettes, the bureau immediately dispatched officials to Pinghu to investigate the matter together with the head of the Jiaxing Investigation Sub-bureau. At that time, the Pinghu Police Bureau had already determined that the detained cigarettes did not involve tax evasion and released them all. However, the cigarette dealer Xiecang Tobacco Company, unwilling to hastily retrieve the more than thirty transportation permits, left them at the police station. Thereupon the bureau's officials requested to review the transportation permits from the police bureau and inspected them one by one. Each one was stamped with a rubber stamp indicating the date of issuance and did not bear the words "Exempt from Inspection." Only in the stamp number column were the words "Approved for Exemption" stamped. The officials then photographed the transportation permits held by the police bureau and the police bureau's original order to release the goods after finding no tax evasion, and brought them back for reporting. After verification by the bureau, they were found to be genuine (and the photos were shown one by one during the explanation). Such reckless accusations of tax evasion and disruption of business are something the bureau must address in accordance with the law and based on the facts, in order to maintain the credibility of national taxes and protect legitimate commerce. As for the fact that the stamp number column on British American Tobacco's transportation permits did not contain a stamp number but was stamped with "Approved for Exemption," this is because the company ships a large number of cigarettes every day. After each box is monitored for stamp application and stamping, they are immediately transported out of the factory. In reality, due to time constraints, it is impossible to fill in the stamp number on each transportation permit. Therefore, in 1928, the former Tobacco Unified Tax Office approved the exemption from filling in the stamp number and added a "Approved for Exemption" stamp on the transportation permits for inspection purposes. Subsequently, in 1932, in order to strengthen management, the bureau re-designated a word-tracking inspection stamp, using the earthly branches for months and rhyming characters for days, and made brown characters to form a mark, which was changed and used daily to stamp on the box surface, so that the unified tax authorities along the way could easily inspect. At the same time, factory staff were still ordered to register the stamp number of each batch of stamps affixed daily, so that if there were any questions after the cigarette shipments were shipped out, the stamp code could be used to find the stamp number, thereby preventing fraud. This method has been implemented for a long time. Although the procedures are different, the management efficiency is still extremely thorough and should not be confused with anything else.

### Lawyers Association Hosts Media

Campaign for Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment

The Shanghai Lawyers Association's Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee has scheduled a reception for the city's press, film, and broadcasting circles on Tuesday of this week. In addition to sending invitation letters, a notice was also sent to the association's executive and supervisory committee members, as well as preparatory committee members yesterday. The notice is recorded below: Respectfully informing you that in order to publicize the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement, a tea party will be held on September (Wednesday) at 4:00 PM on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to entertain the city's press, film, and broadcasting circles. A corresponding letter is hereby delivered. We hope that your esteemed committee members will arrive early to host. We look forward to your presence.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Correction of Stamp Tax on Shareholder Registers

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the 5th of this month, the Osmanthus Round Industry Association stated in a letter that recently, most of the association's members reported that when the stamp tax bureau investigated shareholder registers in their stores, it was claimed that these registers must be stamped according to the number of shares and the level of integration, and cannot be stamped according to the ordinary register category. If the register is only stamped with two corners according to the sticky rice cake register category, it is considered tax evasion. It has been found that the previous method stipulated that when negotiating share certificates, the share certificates must be stamped according to the number of shares, but there is no mention of registers also being stamped according to the number of shares. This is truly questionable. Therefore, a special letter is prepared to request guidance from your esteemed association on whether these registers should be stamped in the same way as share certificates. Please provide instructions for handling. Upon arrival, the association checked the remarks column of the 18th item of the stamp tax law's 16th article tax rate table, which stated that if additional share certificates or stocks are issued, the Wan Jin account books should be stamped according to the 11th type of business premises used in this table, "stamp tax should be applied," etc. In the industry's situation, each shareholder is given a share certificate, which is stamped according to the number of shares, so the shareholder register recording the shares should be stamped at two corners per register, according to the example of business registers mentioned in this item. If the stock certificate uses a two-part form with a stub book, then according to Article 12 of the stamp tax implementation rules, it is not necessary to affix a stamp to the stub book. Based on the foregoing, the statements made by the tax bureau investigators are completely unfounded and are reckless demands. It is reasonable to telegraph the Ministry to request a review and approval, and to issue an order for correction, so as to avoid extra-legal harassment, which would be of public benefit. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows.

### Patient Dies in Car

At six o'clock in the evening the day before yesterday, a man accompanied an "over fifty years old" unidentified patient, taking a rickshaw, intending to go to the hospital for treatment. When passing near the Nanshi Relief Bureau, the old man passed away. The police officer on duty brought him to the Relief Bureau, and the court's prosecutor Weng confirmed that he had died of illness. As no family members could be found, the bureau was ordered to collect the body.

### Asking Wife for Money, Failed Matchmaker, Gong Heshang Acts Violently

The woman Yao Jinmei is twenty-four years old and lives on Lujiazui Road, Pudong. She works as a female worker in the nearby Lunchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory. She married Gong Heshang, who is a scoundrel and often asks Jinmei for money to spend. Jinmei laments her bad luck because her husband is also bad. However, at 9:50 PM last night, Jinmei finished work and left the factory, but Gong was waiting outside. As soon as he saw his wife come out, he stepped forward to forcibly ask her for money. Jinmei sternly refused. Unexpectedly, Gong became angry out of shame and pulled out a sharp knife, stabbing Jinmei three times, twice in the left face and once in the right hand. Jinmei fell to the ground injured, and Gong took the opportunity to escape. The factory's workers saw this and reported it to the police station, who took Jinmei across the Puxi River by boat and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that her injuries are very serious and her life is in danger.

### Film Division of the Political Training Department of the Military Council Producing "Sichuan Disaster Special" to be Released

The Content is Tragic, Hoping that Compatriots Across the Country Will Save and Provide Relief. A Special Commissioner Was Dispatched from Hankou by Plane to Shanghai Yesterday.

At the request of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, the Film Division of the Political Training Department of the Military Council sent Luo Jingyu, the head of the technical team and sound engineer of the division, and Luo Jizhi, a photographer, to Sichuan to film the actual disaster situation. The film has now been completed and edited into Film News No. 34 produced by the division, titled "Sichuan Disaster Special." Yesterday, Luo Jingyu was specially dispatched from Hankou by plane to Shanghai.

General Content

This Sichuan disaster is unprecedented in a century and the situation is extremely tragic. It is said that the film obtained a great deal of material. In order to adapt to the fact that each theater can add the film before the main film, the film was edited as much as possible to about 900 feet, divided into "General Dry Early," "Dry Wheat Without Grain," "Nine Out of Ten Empty Houses," "Displaced People," "Disaster Victims Eat," "Longevity Requires White Mud," "Boiling Grass Roots," "Taking Water in the Mountains," and formed into eight scenes of the disaster. There are also large scenes of thousands of disaster victims and thousands of disaster children. Other information about the central and Sichuan provincial authorities' distribution of emergency relief to disaster victims are all included in the camera. The situation of compatriots across the country donating relief funds and distributing emergency relief in disaster areas is particularly sufficient to show the spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the Chinese nation. It is extremely exciting.

Advance Screening

Because the film is closely related to the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association's fundraising, Luo Jingyu specially went to the Central Exchange Building in the afternoon yesterday to meet with Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, as well as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Tang Dean, Mei Xinru, and others. They all expressed their welcome to the discussion. It is heard that a test screening will be held in the near future.

Simultaneous Release

As for the release date of the film, it has been decided to add it to the films in each theater at the same time. The Huaan Company, which manages the distribution of news short films by the Film Division of the Political Training Department of the Military Council, also plans to assist as much as possible so that the film can be widespread. It is also heard that when the film is released, the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association will set up donation boxes in front of each theater to request donations. In addition, Film News No. 15, recently completed by the division, includes the graduation ceremony of the aviation school that Chairman Chiang personally attended despite his illness, the lively night scene of the celebration of the coronation of the British Emperor in the concession, the commencement of construction of the Sichuan Cement Plant, the chairman's visit to Wuhan University, the recent project of the Qianjiang Iron Bridge, the situation of Ma Xiangbo's birthday, and He Yingqin's speech at the tenth anniversary of the Battle of Mianhu. It is heard that He's is the first recorded sound film, which is especially rare.

### Dance Girl Zhang Lili's Debt Lawsuit Concluded

Zhang Lili, a dance queen who was as famous as Wang Xiaomei in those years, whose original name was Zhang Xuelin, is now over thirty years old. The beauty is late, and she has stopped dancing at home. Fortunately, she still has savings, enough to live idly. In the past, Hong Jiujiang, a rich and extravagant son, occasionally came to Shanghai and set foot in dance halls. He and Zhang hit it off and were as close as lacquer. Soon, Hong bought and returned home. Zhang also tracked to Xiamen. Hong owed Zhang 3,700 yuan in national currency, so Hong telegraphed Wu Bofei, a fellow villager who opened the Dingda Gui Tuan Bank on Shanghai Minquan Road, to guarantee the debt, but it was never repaid. Zhang Lili then hired lawyer Lin Qingchi to sue Wu Bofei in the local court for debt guarantee. Wu also hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to defend, arguing that according to the main body, the guarantor cannot be sued alone without suing the principal debtor. Three court hearings have been held and the debate has ended. However, Judge Wang Run, who presided over the hearing, found that the defendant's lawyer Jiang Pingfan had appeared in court several times, acting as a full power of attorney, but without a power of attorney, the legal procedure was not in compliance and a verdict could not be pronounced. Therefore, he reopened the debate once yesterday and concluded the hearing pending judgment.

### City Federation to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Stopping the Screening of "New Earth"

According to reports from members of the Hongkou District to the City Federation of the First Special District of this city, the Japanese-owned Donghe Cinema on Zha Pu Road is screening the German-Japanese co-produced film "New Earth." The content disrespects our country's territory, undermines our country's sovereignty, insults our country's national system, and violates the four regulations of the Film Inspection Committee of the Public Concession's Industry Bureau Police Department to delete the words "Manchukuo," "Manchukuo Territory," and "Bombing the Great Wall," and "Japanese Soldier Sentries." Only one or two rain spots were deleted, which aroused the indignation of our people. They demanded that a serious negotiation be forwarded to the Industry Bureau and the Japanese Consulate. After receiving the report, the association decided that the Donghe Cinema was openly screening this film in China, wantonly insulting our national system. It will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss how to stop it.

The company believes that there are many hotels in major cities, but the hostel facilities in transportation hubs along the railway line or scenic areas with clear mountains and clear waters are mostly simple. Chinese and foreign tourists feel inconvenient. In response to this need, the company has successively established more than twenty hostels and hotels in important transportation locations or scenic locations, so that travelers can get a quiet and hygienic place for food and lodging, and do not feel the suffering of a long journey.

Organizing Tour Groups

In recent years, the tourism industry has developed rapidly. The company has adapted to the needs and organized tour groups at any time. Domestic short-distance trips to North China, South China, and other places, and foreign countries such as European countries, have been organized one after another. All parties actively participated, believing that the cost was economical and the service was thoughtful. In order to further serve and promote mass travel, the company will unite branches in various places to organize a large-scale national tour group. In the future, the general headquarters will be set up in the Shanghai head office, and each branch will set up a sub-group. At the same time, tours will be held back and forth. Recruitment is currently being organized to expand the recruitment. The benefits for group members are very generous.

This Month's Travel

Before the tour group is formally established, the company will hold regular trips this month, stipulating separate tours in various places, four times a month. All boat, car, food, accommodation, and round-trip itineraries are planned in detail before the deadline, and tour guides are sent to accompany the tour to enjoy the most comfortable trip at the most economical cost. Anyone who has joined other tour groups can join the company's tour group for comparison. They will know the results of its service.

Tour Itinerary

The company stipulates that the branches that should organize tours in June are Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Qingdao, Jinan, Tianjin, Beiping, Singapore, Hangzhou, Nanchang Hankou, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other nineteen places. Each place should take into account the needs and distance of the route and set up separate tour areas, but they must be held once a week. People who like to travel can contact the branches in each place.

### Woman Trafficking Drugs Sentenced to Twelve Years

Zhang Faxiang, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Patrol Room, arrested Gu Fanshi, a woman from Pudong who trafficked the drug red pill, at 7:00 pm on May 20th in Jinglinli, Kunshan Road. Four bags of red pills, each containing one thousand pills, were found on her person. She was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. The main culprit could not be arrested and is awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao came to court and sentenced Gu Fanshi to eleven years of imprisonment and confiscated the red pills.

### Vegetable Stalls on Fuyou Road Were Evicted by Police Officers Yesterday

Guided by the Jiren Relief Association, and Separately Borrowing Small Amounts of Capital

There are 119 vegetarian vegetable stalls in the eastern section of the Fuyou Road vegetable market in Shanghai, which have been set up for more than ten years. They have never been registered. The stallholders take turns paying fines every month (1.2 yuan for vegetarian vegetable stalls and 2.4 yuan for herbal vegetable stalls) to the Yimiao Police Station, and there is no trouble. Last month, the police station suddenly sent police officers to forcibly evict them, causing a storm. All the stallholders elected representatives to petition the municipal government, requesting exemption from relocation to maintain the livelihoods of the poor. Mayor Yu ordered them to wait for verification and handling. The situation has been recorded in this newspaper. However, yesterday (July 7th) at 6:00 am, Chen An, the second patrol officer of the Yimiao Affairs Office, led more than ten police officers, including numbers 4872 and 4766, armed with handguns and rattan whips, to the vegetable market and evicted them again. At that time, the stallholders had just set up their stalls. When they saw the police officers arrive, they panicked and ran away. The police officers kicked over the stalls, causing meat and vegetarian vegetables to fall all over the road and trampled on them. When the vegetable vendors went forward to reason, they were beaten with whips by the police officers, causing chaos. As a result, the vendors Yang Zhonghe (selling pickles, from Shaoxing, 36 years old, living at the end of Dalian Bay Road), Wang Weifu (selling gluten, from Chongming, 21 years old, living in Hongqiao), Hu Yusheng (selling fish, from Ningbo, 22 years old, living on Danfeng Road), Zhu Hengmao (selling vegetarian vegetables, from Shaoxing, 20 years old, living in Yangjia Lane), Fang Derong (selling bean sprouts, from Shaoxing, 42 years old, living on Daji Road), and the woman Gao (selling vegetables, from Jiangyin, 28 years old, living in front of the temple), and others had injuries to their heads, faces, hands, feet, waist, and back. Their families sent them to the Jiren Hospital and the Jiren Relief Association on Bai'er Road for treatment. Because a few of the vegetable vendors were members of the Jiren Relief Association, Shao Rusheng, the president of the association, saw that the vegetable vendors were all small businesses and were very pitiful. He immediately took a car to the city scale branch on that road and, together with Hu Shouqi and others, went to the Yimiao Police Station, requesting a postponement of the eviction until the mayor's instructions were received. Later, he convened all the vendors in the Coal Public Office, sincerely persuading them to wait for the official handling. The vegetable vendors said that the capital for selling meat and vegetarian vegetables was borrowed at high interest. One day, it was trampled on by the police officers, and the livelihood was cut off. The whole family would starve to death. Shao Jun saw this and was very sympathetic. He allowed the Jiren Association to temporarily lend each household from three to six yuan to maintain life. At this point, more than forty people who registered for the loan, borrowing a total of about two hundred yuan, were all grateful. Shao Jun also announced to the public that most of the vendors were from Ningbo and Shaoxing and were local citizens. If necessary, they could go to the Ningbo and Shaoxing hometown associations and local associations for assistance. After the meeting, the vegetable vendors went to the Jiren Association to receive the loan and went home. A riot caused by the eviction of vegetable stalls came to an end.

### Shanghai was Suddenly Hot Yesterday

Temperature 97 Degrees

This city was attacked by a heat wave yesterday. The whole city was like a furnace. After the thunderstorm in the afternoon, the heat began to dissipate. The details are recorded below.

Yesterday's Heat

There was a lot of fog at the wharf at dawn yesterday. After the sun rose, it gradually dissipated. However, the heat was overwhelming and extremely hot. The heat increased at noon, and the whole city was like a furnace. Even when staying indoors, fanning non-stop, sweat still poured out. Walking in the sun would lead to heatstroke. According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature reached 97 degrees, the highest record this year.

Afternoon Thunderstorm

At about 3:30 PM in the afternoon, clouds suddenly gathered and the wind blew tightly. At 4:00 PM, the rain poured down. The momentum was extremely rapid. It stopped slightly at 4:30 PM, and thunder rumbled. Heavy rain continued to fall and stopped at 5:00 PM. After the rain, the heat was washed away. However, the sky was still cloudy, and the weather was uncertain. It is also heard that the number of heatstroke patients in the infectious disease hospital suddenly increased at noon yesterday, especially small workers.

### Two Criminals in Tang Youren Case Appeal

Original Sentences Were Both Death

Liu Zhennan, from Hubei, and Qiu Jiyu, from Shaoxing, the murderers in the case of the assassination of Tang Youren, the former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, were successively arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Public Patrol Room. The French Patrol Room handed them over to the Second Special Court. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution for murder. Former Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu and current Court President Liao Yong repeatedly opened court sessions to conduct inquiries and found that the two criminals had previously committed kidnapping and robbery cases. They were sentenced on the 25th of last month. Liu and Qiu were sentenced to death for recidivism and joint murder, and were deprived of their political rights for life. During the appeal period, they were still returned to the detention center. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. After receiving the judgment in the detention center, the two criminals expressed their dissatisfaction to the warden and applied for an appeal. The detention center has transferred the two criminals' application for dissatisfaction with the original judgment to the original trial Second Special Court Criminal Court for review. It is now heard that the Second Special Court has checked and assembled the complete case file after receiving the presentation and submitted it to the Third Branch Court for review.

### Family Sabotage Crime Takes an Unexpected Turn

Original Accusations of Mutual Smoking, Examination Shows Both Have Opium Habit

Liu Shifu, a Jiangbei man, 28 years old, who is a waiter at Yuanyuan Tea House at the intersection of Bai'er Road and Pingjili Road in the French Concession, married Ding Zhixi, a woman from his hometown, as his wife. After the marriage, the couple had a harmonious relationship. A year ago, Liu and his wife rented the remaining house from Xia Jinhong (40 years old), a Yancheng man who was formerly a Chinese police officer in the French Patrol Room No. 169. Unexpectedly, in March of last year, Liu's wife, Ding, suddenly eloped without her husband's knowledge. Liu searched everywhere but found no news. It was not until recently that Liu Shifu discovered that the second landlord, Xia Jinhong, had instigated his wife, Ding, to elope and was living with her in a lewd relationship. He hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Special Court Criminal Court, accusing Xia Jinhong of instigating his wife to elope and live in a lewd relationship, sabotaging the family, and requesting a legal investigation. The French court, based on the complaint, had Judge Zhang Minsheng come to the Second Criminal Court to interrogate both parties on time yesterday morning. In the courtroom, they mutually attacked each other for smoking opium, causing an unexpected turn in the case. Judge Zhang then instructed that since both sides accused each other of smoking, they must be sent for a forensic examination. He also instructed that the case be adjourned for another hearing. After the court adjourned, the judge ordered the bailiff to send Liu and Xia to the forensic doctor's office for examination. It was found that both sides had smoking behavior. The court then ordered the bailiff to transfer Liu and Xia to the Police Department for investigation and wait to be sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Second Special Court for questioning today.

### Forcibly Wanting to be a Matchmaker, Extorting Money by Intimidation

Resulting in a Sentence of Six Months

Guo Youyi, a 24-year-old employee of the Huasheng Light Bulb Factory at No. 148 Jingzhou Road, is still single. Two weeks ago, Guo went to No. 3 Dengtuo Road, the New China Light Bulb Factory, to visit his friend Xu Chunshou. He happened to meet Chen Yuqin, a female worker in the factory. They fell in love at first sight and secretly made a lifelong commitment. Guo asked his cousin Dong Futang and friend Zhu Kunsheng to act as matchmakers to bring the matter to the woman's parents. However, Xu Chunshou also wanted to join as a matchmaker, saying that if Guo did not use him, he would not be able to get such a beautiful wife, and demanded a matchmaker fee of 200 yuan from Guo. Otherwise, it would be difficult to succeed. Guo refused to pay attention to him. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 PM on the fifth day, he gathered a number of vagrants and used intimidation to drag Guo to the Xiuxian Tea House at No. 393 Huade Road. As a result, Guo agreed to give 30 yuan. Unable to pay the money, he wrote an IOU and handed it over to Xu, stating that he would first pay 10 yuan the day before yesterday afternoon at 8:00 PM, and the rest would be paid off before the 13th. When the time came, Guo took the money to the Linxian Tea House. Dong Futang and Zhu Kunsheng reported the information to the Yulin Road Patrol Room, which sent detective Li Hongsheng and Zhao Jianchun to assist the Western detectives to rush to the tea house and arrest Xu Chunshou. A iron chain and soft whip were found on his person. He and his accomplices Cao Chengli, Zhang Zhongxian, and other 13 suspects were taken to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the process and requested an investigation. After questioning, Judge Bian Fen sentenced Xu Chunshou, Cao Chengli, Zhang Zhongxian, Shi Jianmo, Qian Zhangsheng, and Ji Guangju to six months of imprisonment and confiscated the iron chain. The remaining seven people, including Zhou Longsan, were released.

### Husband Dead, Son Died Young, Loss of Livelihood, No Funds Available

The orphaned Madam Jiang of Song is pitifully alone, appealing to her mother-in-law for support.

Song Yuting, a local man, married Madam Han and had two sons, Fusheng and Xiangsheng, both of whom married. However, Fusheng's son died in 1914. His wife, Madam Jiang, had no children but vowed to remain a widow. In 1929, Song Yuting also passed away, leaving behind property worth over ten thousand yuan. After discussions among relatives, a family property agreement was drawn up with the following provisions: Song Yuting's property would be managed by Madam Han. Since the eldest son, Fusheng, had no descendants, Huizhong, the son of the second son, Xiangsheng, would become Madam Jiang's adopted son. Two hundred yuan would be allocated annually from the rental income for Madam Jiang's expenses. Further division of the property would occur when Huizhong and others became self-sufficient. Any sale of property would require Madam Jiang's consent. This arrangement was intended to encourage Madam Jiang's commitment to widowhood. Later, Madam Jiang requested an increase of five hundred yuan because the annual two hundred yuan was insufficient. Her mother-in-law, Madam Han, and others agreed and made a separate payment. However, Huizhong suddenly died. The Song family then began to give Madam Jiang cold looks and sarcastic remarks and stopped paying her the necessary living expenses. Madam Jiang discovered that her father-in-law's estate had been sold without authorization, completely overturning the agreement made by the relatives. Left with no choice, Madam Jiang hired lawyer Li Zhongwen to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against her mother-in-law, Song Han, and her husband's younger brother, Zhu Xiangsheng, seeking payment of eight thousand six hundred yuan in arrears and nine thousand yuan for future maintenance. Judge Xu Fuji of the Twelfth Civil Court heard the case and summoned the defendants. After lawyer Li Zhongwen presented the reasons for the lawsuit, the defendants vehemently denied all allegations. After Judge Xu's interrogation, he ordered the case to be reviewed at a later date.

### 450,000 Deaf and Mute People Urgently Need Social Relief

Impoverished deaf and mute individuals lack educational opportunities, and their hidden potential remains untapped.

According to experts, the number of deaf and mute people in China reaches 450,000. Due to the extreme lack of relief efforts for the deaf and mute in our country, they suffer greatly. A reporter from Datong News Agency sought to understand the living conditions of the deaf and mute in Shanghai and recorded the following information:

General Overview of Shanghai's Schools for the Deaf and Mute

Yesterday, a Datong News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Dai Shi, an expert who has been involved in deaf and mute education for over ten years, about the conditions of the deaf and mute in Shanghai. Mr. Dai stated with emotion that according to statistics from various countries, approximately one in every thousand people is deaf or mute. Given Shanghai's dense population, the number of deaf and mute individuals is considerable. However, only a limited number of these deaf and mute people receive education. Shanghai has only four schools: Sacred Heart Institute, Shanghai School for the Deaf and Mute, Qunxue Society School for the Deaf and Mute, and Fuya School. The total number of students in these four schools is less than three hundred.

The Impoverished Rarely Get Educational Opportunities

Given the large number of deaf and mute individuals in Shanghai, only a few receive education. This is because China lacks large-scale, free schools for the deaf and mute, leaving the majority of young deaf and mute people without educational opportunities, preventing the development of their hidden potential, leaving them with lifelong regrets, and causing them immeasurable suffering. In Europe and America, the deaf and mute not only receive free education but also receive considerable financial assistance. Steamships and ships offer free or discounted fares to the deaf and mute.

Government and Society Should Offer Sympathy and Relief

People in Chinese society should provide compassion and assistance to the deaf and mute. The government should also provide relief so that the deaf and mute can have a better future. Mr. Dai also expressed some thoughts on deaf and mute education. His main point was that deaf and mute schools have varying teaching methods, including gesture imitation, figure gestures, and sound gestures. Pronunciation methods include the Belli method and the phonetic method. This inconsistency prevents deaf and mute students who have been educated at different schools from communicating with each other. This is an issue that deserves further discussion in the field of deaf and mute education.

### Fourteen Organizations Prepare for Memorial Service for Niu Huisheng

The Chinese Medical Association, National Physician Federation, Shanghai Physician Association, St. John's University, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Ginling College, National Christian Council of China, China Leprosy Relief Association, Red Cross Society of China, National Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Hangzhou Guangci Hospital, and National Federation of New Medicine Industry Associations have jointly established a preparatory committee for a memorial service for Dr. Niu Huisheng. A memorial service will be held on a selected date, and a collection of reminiscences of Dr. Niu Huisheng will be published beforehand to commemorate his memory. Anyone who wishes to contribute Dr. Niu's wise words and exemplary deeds can submit them to the Chinese Medical Association on Chihong Road, Shanghai, before July 10 to facilitate the planning of the memorial service.

### Worker Crushed to Death by Huge Machine

Wu Hong'er, a 45-year-old worker from Taixing, employed by the Hua Fu Transportation Company at 19 Hua Ji Road, was unloading a large machine from a truck at the Makine Road train station at around 7 PM the day before yesterday with several other workers. Because Wu was not strong enough, he was crushed by the machine and severely injured. He was taken to Tongren Hospital but died en route. The hospital reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the autopsy station on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, and medical examiner Zhang Yan arrived at the station to confirm the identity of the body. Zhang then declared that the deceased, Wu Hong'er, was male and died from being crushed by a heavy object. The body was released to his son, Wu Hongyuan, after he signed the necessary documents.

### Animal Protection Society Requests Investigation and Prohibition of Buying Fetal Lambs

The China Animal Protection Society received a letter yesterday from Zhang Diefu of Haimen, stating that recently, some peddlers in the county have been buying fetal lambs and reselling them for profit. He specifically requested the Haimen County Government to order an investigation and prohibition. The letter from Zhang Diefu stated that recently, some peddlers in the county have been buying fetal lambs and reselling them for profit, causing the mother sheep to suffer the pain of being cut open and the fetal lambs to die immediately after being born. These cruel methods are beyond description, and he requested measures to stop them. The killing and skinning of fetal lambs have long been prohibited by central government orders. However, ignorant merchants only seek profit and disregard the law. Moreover, skinning them alive results in multiple deaths with pitiful cries, which are unbearable for benevolent people. Therefore, the county government is specifically requested to order the police bureau to strictly investigate and prohibit this practice at any time to curb this cruel custom and maintain the law. He also hoped to receive a reply with confirmation. The society had previously sent a letter to the Fujian Provincial Government regarding the common practice in inland counties of southern Fujian where residents along streams use poison to kill fish and shrimp for sale. The society requested that the practice be strictly prohibited. The society received a letter yesterday from the Fujian Provincial Government stating that it had ordered all counties to strictly prohibit the practice.

### Sub-Committee on Mezzanines to Discuss Measures Again

Existing Mezzanines Exempt from Demolition; Future Construction Requires Permits

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement announced its intention to demolish mezzanines in the Settlement, it has caused great anxiety among residents, who have unanimously expressed their opposition. Subsequently, the Municipal Council appointed two Chinese directors, Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, along with Mr. Jin, to form a sub-committee to further study the issue. The sub-committee has held several discussions and is about to submit a report. Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu believe that this case is related to the safety of ordinary people's housing. In order to gather opinions from all sides, they invited Yu Qiaqing and other Chinese directors and committee members, as well as Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the First Special District Citizens' Association, and He, the representative of the association, to lunch at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club yesterday afternoon. They discussed the case in detail. It is understood that the sub-committee's views can be summarized into one principle: (1) Existing mezzanines will be exempt from demolition; (2) However, residents who need to build mezzanines in the future must first obtain a permit to show restrictions. The sub-committee believes that the Municipal Council's proposed regulation to set the height of buildings at eight feet is unreasonable and tantamount to "throwing the baby out with the bathwater" and is determined to correct it.

### Children's Dental Health Association Organized

The Shanghai Branch of the China Health Education Society, the Shanghai Health Education Committee, the Chinese Health Education Research Association, and the Family Industry Society Children's Dental Clinic jointly launched the "June 6th Cavity Prevention Day." The results of the examination of children's cavities in the city, held in four locations, showed that (due to lack of manpower, each location was limited to examining 600 people, but the actual number reached over 2,000) among the over 3,000 children, about 70% had cavities. The causes of cavities were 60-70% due to poor oral hygiene (failure to brush teeth), and the remainder due to malnutrition. From this, it can be seen that the main cause of cavities in Chinese children is poor oral hygiene, and the way to prevent them is to maintain good oral hygiene and pay attention to children's nutrition. In view of this, various health education organizations, in addition to planning how to expand publicity for the next June 6th, also plan to organize a Chinese Children's Dental Health Association to promote dental health education year-round, and there is talk of inviting Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau to be the chairman of the association.

### Dongguan Native Place Association Elects Directors and Supervisors Yesterday

The Dongguan Native Place Association in Shanghai held an election meeting at the Guangdong Yuguang School on North Sichuan Road at 1 PM yesterday (the 6th). Over a hundred people attended. The presidium, consisting of Huang Zesheng, Wu Dingming, Li Yaohuang, Wang Daren, and Zhai Rongji, announced and reported the reasons for the meeting, the preparations, and other matters. Subsequently, ballots were cast, and the following fifteen individuals were elected as directors: Wang Chonghui, Huang Zesheng, Wang Daren, Wu Dingming, Li Yaohuang, Yuan Liangzou, Zhang Yinting, Zhang Yiting, Fang Zhifen, Wu Jingshan, Chen Yuanheng, Ding Yaotang, Li He, Liu Qirun, and Xu Tang. Ding Wende, Zhai Rongji, and Chen Haobin were elected as alternate directors. Lu Baofa, Xiao Songpo, and Zhong Zhongliang were elected as supervisors, and Ding Yixuan and Yuan Zongze were elected as alternate supervisors. It is said that the directors and supervisors will be sworn into office soon.

### Investigation of Fu Wenhao's Robbery Case Not Yet Concluded

Lin Chuanyao Still Detained at 72 Avenue Albert, French Concession.

The home of Fu Wenhao, a famous Shanghai socialite from Sichuan, located on the fourth floor of a building at 72 Avenue Albert, French Concession, was robbed at around 6 AM on July 21 last year. Two tenants claiming to be law students colluded with two robbers armed with three pistols. They robbed Fu and other tenants of clothing and valuables worth three to four thousand yuan and fled. The two tenants claiming to be law students also disappeared on the same day. Until the evening of the 31st of last month, Cheng Datian and Cheng Jingfa, brother and sister, tenants of Fu, captured a young man named Lin Chuanyao (29 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong) in the Hehefang alley on Avenue Joffre, and identified him as one of the robbers who robbed Fu Wenhao's home last year. They turned him over to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation, as previously reported in this newspaper. At 10 AM yesterday, Judge Chen Shuoying continued the hearing in the criminal court. Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the police department, stated the case, briefly stating that the investigation of this case was not yet completed and requested a postponement. When questioned, the defendant Lin Chuanyao testified that he was in Nanjing on the day the plaintiff reported the robbery and that Zhong Wenwei, a member of the Central Committee, could prove it. The court noted that the case still needed investigation and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 14th. The defendant remained in custody.

### Bandits Arrested in Zhejiang Road Hotel

Nine Bandits Arrested, One Pistol Seized

A group of bandits led by Mao Gengsheng and the nickname "Little Taoist" had committed numerous crimes in Shanghai and other places. Last October, their accomplice Shen was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. The remaining bandits scattered throughout Shanghai and other places. After obtaining information, they reported to Shanghai and came to Shanghai to commit robberies. The police authorities of both the Chinese and foreign settlements in Shanghai paid close attention. However, there was nothing they could do. At around 2 AM yesterday morning, detectives Huang Damin and Chen Delong of the Sixth Detachment of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau learned that the aforementioned gang of bandits had robbed the home of Cai Jinrong (a local tailor) at the southern end of Nanxin Bridge, Lao Longhua, of valuables at around 6 PM the day before yesterday (Sunday). Cai had recently sold land to the Longhua Airport and obtained several thousand yuan, which attracted the attention of the bandits. They were hiding in the New Soho and Pingjiang hotels on Zhejiang Road in the British Concession. They immediately reported to Detachment Leader Qian Tianxiong and brought the original informant and other detectives such as Liu Heng and Liu Yufu to the New Gate Police Station to add Chinese and foreign detectives. At around 8 AM, they went to Room 49 of the New Soho Hotel and Room 33 of the Pingjiang Hotel and arrested nine male and female bandits, including Mao Gengsheng (nickname), Shen Yingsheng, Yi Ming Gengsong, and the woman Mao He. They seized a pistol, eleven bullets, and many stolen goods and summoned the victim Cai Jinrong to identify the stolen goods. Cai's forehead had been injured by a pistol during the robbery, and he had bled profusely. After Cai identified the bandit, it was confirmed that the bandit's nickname was "Little Taoist." The police station will temporarily detain the bandits for investigation of cases within its jurisdiction and will hand them over to the First Special District Court for questioning.

### Lu Xihou Sues for Double Payment

Qian ChengSheng et al. Claim They Only Handle Registration; Debt Settlement Not Within Knowledge

Lu Xihou, 44 years old, of Shanghai, the legal representative of the China Industrial Bank, sued for a double payment. The bank had declared bankruptcy due to financial difficulties and had appointed lawyer Qian Shusheng, Li Ding, and Xu Yongzuo to liquidate its assets. The bank's Nanshi branch, located on Dongmen Road, had defaulted on eleven months of rent due to the rent reduction movement, totaling 2,640 yuan (240 yuan per month). Lu Xihou used a passbook account from the bank to pay the landlord, Feng Lesan. However, the rent reduction movement was not completed, and the bank went bankrupt. Feng Le Er and Wang Deda, a guarantor from the Wang Deda sesame oil shop, registered the passbook with the liquidators. Later, because the bankruptcy procedures damaged his rights, he pursued Wang Deda, the guarantor, in court. Wang Deda then paid on his behalf and took back the passbook. Wang Deda then reconciled with Lu Xihou and returned the passbook to Lu Xihou. Lu, in possession of the passbook, then sued Feng Lesan, Qian Shusheng, Li Ding, Xu Yongzuo, and others in the local court for double payment and joint fraud. Yesterday, Judge Bai Dongling opened the court. Lu Xihou supplemented the facts, stating that there was also an account from July 21, 1925, that had already been cleared but was also registered, so it was also a double payment. The defendant, Feng Lesan, did not appear. Qian Shusheng, Li Ding, and Xu Yongzuo jointly argued that their procedures were only for registration. If the evidence was valid, of course they would register and then investigate. Registration did not mean immediate payment. They were not aware of the settlement outside the court and claimed it was a false accusation. As for the other account, the liquidation documents had long been returned. Lu Xihou clearly did not understand. The court ordered the case to be rescheduled.

### Zhang Rongxuan Embezzles 5,000 Yuan from Yufeng

Zhang Rongxuan, an employee of the Dashenglan Bank in Hangzhou, came to Shanghai on the 31st of last month and withdrew 5,000 yuan in national currency from the Yufeng Silk Factory at 10 Yingpan Bridge, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei. At the time, the factory paid the amount because there had always been business dealings between the two parties and they did not suspect anything. However, after receiving the money, Zhang fled with his wife. The factory has reported the matter to the local court's prosecutor's office and has requested the city police to conduct a strict search to bring him to justice as soon as possible.

### Suiyang Steamer Solves a Kidnapping Case

Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, discovered a case on the morning of the day before yesterday, at around 8 AM, aboard the Taikoo Company's South China route steamer Suiyang, where a woman named Zhang Yao was kidnapping a five-year-old boy named Da Daizi, intending to sell him in Shantou. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Water police detective Wang Haiquan learned that the child's home was at 1 Songlan Lane, Tokyo Road, International Settlement. His father's name was Liu Guyu, from Jiangbei, who worked as a rickshaw puller. Liu's wife had taken their son out to sell cloth on the morning of the 2nd of this month at the corner of Makine Road and Gordon Road. The child suddenly disappeared. Liu's wife only had this son and searched everywhere without success, returning home and crying so much that she nearly went insane. After the detective sent the child back, the mother and son met, and Liu's wife felt extremely relieved and the insanity disappeared. The police chief believed that the kidnapper's act of separating a family was despicable and turned her over to the court for severe punishment yesterday.

### Vessels Sailing in the Far East Establish New Rental Records

Jardine Matheson's Athelking Chartered; Rent at 10 Shillings per Ton per Month

According to sources in the shipping industry, the demand for vessels sailing in the Far East has exceeded supply, causing rental rates to reach new highs. Jardine Matheson has chartered its motor vessel Athelking, weighing 9,300 tons, for voyages between the Far East and England at a rate of ten shillings per ton per month. This is the highest rental rate in many years. However, the situation is somewhat different from usual, as the Far East urgently needs vessels to supplement the Eastern regular vessels of the Hamburg America Line. Recently, various shipping companies have chartered wild flag ships to join regular routes, paying full rental fees upfront to ensure early loading and arrival. The need for vessels to transport scrap iron from the United States to Japan is particularly urgent, causing forward rates for vessels loading in Mexico in July and August to reach 37 shillings per ton, not including port charges. The Apuae, built in 1895 and holding a Hong Kong passenger certificate, has been chartered for six months at a monthly rental fee of 17,000 yuan, with delivery scheduled for May. Freight rates for transporting ore to Japan and scrap iron from Hong Kong to Japan have risen to ten yuan per ton. Despite these high rates, bookings continue to be made, and the price is not a major concern. Demand from various quarters remains strong, and there are few vessels available to meet the demand. The disparity between supply and demand is evident.

### Mo Genjin Murders Friend

Wife Has New Love; Friend Acts as Matchmaker

Mo Genjin, 26 years old, from Changshu, made a living selling small commodities. He lived with his mistress, Sun Dakouzi, 26 years old, at 24 Jinjia Archway, West Gate. Recently, Sun Dakouzi began to fool around outside and became involved with another man. She treated Mo Genjin as an eyesore and often created quarrels in the hope that Mo Genjin would fear her and leave, resulting in constant conflict. However, Mo Genjin was resolute and endured Sun Dakouzi's cold looks and threats, ignoring them. He tirelessly searched for information about his mistress's new lover. He soon discovered that his rival was Xue Bao, a fellow villager living in Nanning Lane, Haining Road, who had acted as a matchmaker. Mo Genjin hated Xue intensely and planned to kill him. At around 7:50 PM last night, Mo, armed with a sharp blade, went to Yinzhichu to confront him. However, when he reached near Tangjia Lane, Xue happened to be walking by. An argument broke out as soon as they saw each other. In a fit of rage, Mo Genjin stabbed Xue in the back with the blade. Xue was unable to dodge and was stabbed in the heart. Xue collapsed and died. The murderer Mo Genjin attempted to flee, but nearby police officers arrived and arrested him, taking him to the police station to be handed over to the court for investigation this morning. Xue's body was taken to the autopsy station, and an application will be made to the court for an examination today.

Reply on Behalf of the Defendants in the Case of Endangering the People and Request for Suspension of Detention

(Facts)

The green-faced eastern neighbor invades and encroaches, disturbing the borders on all sides, encompassing four provinces. By December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, Chahar north of the Great Wall had been lost, and a puppet organization in eastern Hebei within Shanhaiguan was declared to be established, with troops stationed increasing and spies rampant. Smuggling was rampant, and vagrants roamed freely. With the ambition to swallow everything within the universe, treacherous people in Hebei used the guise of petitions for autonomy to act like accomplices of tigers, creating a precarious situation. Thus, professors in Peking and Tianjin shouted from the front, and students and citizens followed behind, stirring up the entire nation. People in Shanghai organized the National Salvation Association. A report in the Shenbao Weekly on January 1, 1926, stated: "After this news spread, the people of the entire nation were extremely indignant. More than 300 people from Shanghai's cultural circles, including Ma Xiangbo, recognizing the increasing crisis of the Chinese nation and that Rehe in the north would become another puppet state, initiated a national salvation movement and issued a declaration proposing seven points: (1) Insist on the integrity of territory and sovereignty, and reject all treaties and agreements that harm territory and sovereignty; (2) Resolutely oppose the establishment of special administrative organizations in Chinese territory under any name instigated by foreign forces; (3) Resolutely reject resolving the Northeast issue and the North China issue through local incidents; (4) Demand immediate dispatch of troops to suppress eastern Hebei; (5) Omitted (the original text is omitted, presumably to avoid international disputes); (6) Severely punish all traitors and confiscate their property; (7) Demand freedom of association, assembly, speech, and publication for the people... The national salvation movement spread throughout the country with high morale, which is rare in recent years," and so on. This is a true record of the time. The defendants witnessed the fragmentation of the country and mourned the impending doom, rising up and daring to do what others had not. At that time, the National Salvation Association and the defendants believed that the only way to save the country was through the unity of the entire nation to resist the enemy. Therefore, their words and actions were all based on this goal. In terms of peaceful unification and concentrating strength, these were merely methods to achieve this goal. All of these circumstances are sufficiently proven by the documents of the National Salvation Association and the individual defendants cited in the following defense reasons. Afterwards, the national sentiment of resisting the enemy increased daily, providing a strong and powerful backing for the government's diplomacy. The conspiracy of the treacherous people was defeated, the situation in North China temporarily stabilized, diplomatic efforts with Japan were strengthened, and the arrogance of the enemy was somewhat suppressed. The defendants humbly regretted the weakness of their personal abilities and that their hearts to serve the country were not fully realized. Unexpectedly, at midnight on November 22nd of last year, they were suddenly arrested simultaneously in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. Finally, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department sent a letter to the procuratorate of your court for investigation. After extending the detention period for two months, on the day of expiration, they were indicted under Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes of Endangering the Republic of China for the crime of jointly endangering the Republic of China.

Reasons for Defense

According to Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes of Endangering the Republic of China, the crime is "organizing groups, holding meetings, or propagating doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China." The indictment alleges that the defendants are suspected of jointly organizing groups with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China and propagating doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. However, accusing patriotic acts as endangering the country and labeling the call for national salvation as propagating doctrines that violate the Three Principles of the People is a complete distortion of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white, a trampling of the dignity of the law, and a reckless judgment of historical merit and demerit. The sincerity of the National Salvation Association and the defendants is evident in various documents. Consider the "Declaration of the Founding Assembly of the National Salvation Federation of All Circles": the first page states, "Our only way to save the country and ensure survival is to immediately unite the whole country and resist the enemy with all our strength." The second page states, "At this time when the enemy's invasion is deepening and internal disputes are still serious, people with a sense of conscience are eager for a broad unity and a unified national united front for national salvation. In response to this demand, representatives of national salvation organizations from all circles in various parts of the country have convened the founding assembly of the National Salvation Federation of All Circles in Shanghai, establishing a unified people's national salvation Chen Qian." The slogan on the sixth page is "Long live the unity of the Chinese nation, long live the victory of the anti-Japanese war, long live the liberation of the Chinese nation." The "Preliminary Political Outline for Anti-Japanese National Salvation" on the eighth page (page numbers are calculated from the previously mentioned declaration) states, "The common enemies of the national salvation front are Japanese imperialism and traitors." The "Work Review of the Founding Assembly of the National Salvation Federation of All Circles" on the fifteenth page states, "The meaning of the united front is to unite all parties and factions horizontally and to unite all social strata vertically to deal with the common enemy. Such expanded unity requires extreme sincerity and extreme tolerance." The second page states, "The meaning of the united front can be explained by the four words 'crossing the river in the same boat'. When a ship encounters danger, the people on board will naturally forget all the usual differences between parties and conflicts of opinion and work together to get the ship out of danger. At that time, if there are truly a few people who disregard the overall situation and care only about their own luggage and disregard the lives of the public, then they are the public enemy and traitors. Apart from that, there should be no other disputes. All party differences and conflicts of opinion can only be settled after the danger has passed, but after having shared hardships, perhaps there will be no need to settle accounts." "Several Basic Conditions and Minimum Requirements for Unity and Resistance against Aggression" published by Junru, Naiqi, Taofen, Tao Xingzhi and others in their individual names on the first and second pages states, "Subsequently, we further hope that Mr. Chiang will personally lead the millions of standing troops under the jurisdiction of the National Government, mobilize all the manpower, financial resources, intelligence, and material resources of the country, and launch a sacred national liberation war. After this national liberation war achieves complete victory, Mr. Chiang will not only be the supreme leader of the Republic of China, but also become the greatest national hero in Chinese history. This is what we hope for with the utmost sincerity." In the end, whether the purpose of the National Salvation Association is to save the country or harm it, and whether its主張 is contrary to the Three Principles of the People or is precisely what the Three Principles of the People dictate, is clear without further explanation.

### Another Interpretation of "Justice"

— Ziga

Although the two characters "Justice" are a very beautiful noun, in the minds of some people, they always only recognize that the noun sounds good, and there is no need to demand its content. Their meaning is: to suspend this as the highest ideal goal, let people always yearn for and pursue it; but there is no need to expect its realization. If there are really such people who must believe that this noun is real, and come out to advocate "justice," then he deserves to suffer. Because although people are honest, they should not be so stupid.

However, from ancient times to the present, there have been fools among human beings who are willing to endure hardship and continue to come out to uphold "justice," which inevitably makes the rulers flustered.

Because their original intention, the so-called "justice," is just a beautiful abstract noun, but now someone seriously demands its substance, which is a bit difficult to deal with.

However, the worrying thing is not just this.

The important thing is that these people are usually the embodiment of injustice. Now the target of attack is concentrated on them, and the result of the attack will strip away their masks and reveal their final appearance. This will naturally hurt these people's self-esteem, causing them to finally forget their gentleman status and start roaring wildly.

This is the reason why Mexican Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Fresco, was attacked by foreign expatriates in this port for writing a book "Shanghai - A Paradise for Adventurers," and finally had to leave his post.

However, these gentlemen's identities are usually unwilling to tear down themselves. The means to deal with those who demand "justice" is usually to say that their own behavior is also in accordance with "justice." Because "this is also a right and wrong, that is also a right and wrong," the noun "justice" can be falsely used by everyone. Especially the people on our semi-colonial land, in the eyes of white gentlemen, are just slaves who can be enslaved and trampled on: then is it not a very fair thing for these "20th-century adventurers who do not go to the barren and desolate areas to make a living, nor do they find materials in the truth and justice, but specialize in showing their unique skills in the sea of people... making me lean while making myself fat is their faith, their religion, and their entire philosophy of life"? Mussolini's conquest of Abyssinia also said that he wanted to give them the baptism of civilization: our friendly countries' occupation of Manchuria must also be said to be for the sake of extending their own lifeline. In this way, does the essence of the so-called "justice" really seem to be on the other side and not on this side?

I think: if the current social system is to continue to exist for one day, then these two opposite interpretations of "justice" will also continue to exist. True social "justice" will never be realized, and those who believe that this noun is true and therefore stand up to advocate it will inevitably fall into the same fate as Fresco.

### Old Black

— Luo Yan

Someone greeted from the loading door under the warehouse; his shoulders and the top of his head were covered with grayish-yellow powder, and two kind, yellow eyes flashed on his lean face.

—Is that you, Old Black? Why did you run away for so long, and why did you run back? I guess you went to be a soldier. But this time back, it goes without saying, you can desert very well.

Old Black was a very burly man, with his unseasonal clothes open, standing on this somewhat unfamiliar pier. Amidst its shouting and shaking, his sturdy body of reddish-black flesh, which was used to bumping and crushing, still stood out strongly in people's eyes.

He just smiled slyly with a bit of elegance:

—I didn't desert, I was released!

—What are you saying? Would they be so stupid as to let you go? They wouldn't let go of a strong guy like you. You grabbed a coal car from Yangcun and ran to Tianjin like I did last time, right?

—You're completely wrong. Old Black pulled open the front of his shirt to show his companion: I strolled out of that court in Hebei at eight o'clock! I fought a lawsuit for three months.

—Fought a lawsuit for three months! The companion imitated him, with the same sly smile appearing on his face.

Old Black took off his sweat-soaked shirt and sighed, "What warm weather," as he watched his old partners lined up on the ground, shaking and moving under the cargo bars, carrying goods. The thick iron cables rubbed over people's heads, and his eyes were blurred by steam and flour, and by the reddish-brown flesh of the people.

Old Black once had only one desire: he wanted to live like a human being. He overcame all hardships, spent his money generously, and paid for his partners' lodging. He also had a secret ambition to become a foreman, a porter, or do something even more amazing—which he never dared to say. But the city's scene withered along with the cold season, and he was unwilling to go hungry, because, for him, being hungry was ten times more unbearable.

On a windy winter night, he couldn't help but go steal. People can steal and become rich, and become strong. Naturally, he can also steal and not be hungry. So, he stole, kicking aside weak moans and foolish advice, and extending his powerful arms. What a vivid performance! People couldn't help but say that this behavior wasn't stealing; it was taking, using his powerful palms to take the fuel for his life; therefore, there was no need for secrecy and timidity. His assistant, a small out-of-towner, even envied him; but, in that dark night, they were both bound.

It wasn't because of the stealing that he felt deep shame, but because of such an unlucky failure. He felt that some words in his belly were about to breed worms.

In the inn after dinner, Old Black's large shadow swayed again with renewed enthusiasm. On the paper window, his mouth was moving, and his soft Hebei dialect flowed excitedly—like a hippopotamus roaring when insulted, he spat out the words in his belly:

—We failed! But I didn't say anything about the prison, Old Black didn't do that. You'll understand what I mean; if it wasn't for being alone... maybe, we need more buddies, more.

After roaring like this, Old Black searched for more partners every day. He would go with them to steal, to take the fuel for their lives; but they must never fail, Old Black determined.

### Soybeans are the Most Extraordinary Plant in the World

— Te

The day before yesterday, I saw a piece of news in the North China Daily News with the headline "Invaluable Food for England," followed by two subheadings: "The Wonderful Soybean is a Boon for Famine Relief" and "Thirty Years of Research Success." I thought it must be a record of some new scientific invention. Looking at its contents, it turned out to be a reprint of an article from the London Sunday Chronicle about growing soybeans. We have always regarded soybeans as extremely ordinary, but I wonder why the British value them so much. After thinking about it carefully, there are two reasons. One is that our product is produced too much. Things are valued when they are rare, and when there are too many, they naturally become unremarkable. The other is that foreign science is developed and can make full use of it, making many useful industrial products. We have only regarded it as a secondary food for thousands of years, so naturally, we don't think it's amazing. I think again, isn't the most abundant soybean producing area in the world in the three eastern provinces? Such a large natural treasure was easily dragged away like a weasel stealing a chicken, and they peacefully enjoy its profits. A thing that we have always regarded as extremely ordinary is now being suppressed by others, and we are gradually feeling its value. Therefore, after reading this soybean growing record, I can't help but have endless feelings, so I translated it and posted it below.

Mr. Kidd said: One day I stood in a beautiful garden in Chiswick, watching a seventy-seven-year-old white-haired botanist, holding a handful of black, dark yellow, and light yellow soybeans in his hand, leisurely planting them one by one in the mud. On the surface, they all looked like uninteresting and very ordinary soybeans, but in fact, this small thing is magical and incredible. This botanist is Mr. Rouse, a former lecturer at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Regent's Park. He spent many years of hard work and finally discovered four different types of soybeans suitable for British soil. He experimented with soybeans produced in Manchuria for more than thirty years and finally obtained several types that can be grown in England. With this kind of grain, if England encounters a war and is blockaded by the enemy, the whole country

There are about three thousand kinds of beans in total. He has tried planting two or three hundred kinds and has now obtained several kinds suitable for England, named Black O, Dark Yellow C, Green Jan, and Light Yellow J. This year, hundreds of acres of land in England will be planted with Mr. Rouse's seeds, and many farmers have already used soybeans as a crop for rotation. Once England widely plants soybeans, the country can obtain an invaluable food and add a treasure to industry because the magical soybean can provide soy milk containing all the good qualities of milk, first-class artificial cream, soy sauce, and cheese as food, and can make oil, glue, enamel, soap, artificial ivory, glycerin, rubber substitutes, waterproof items, printing ink, glass-like transparent materials, and various other things in industry. If soybeans can be fully utilized, the living standards of the entire population of Great Britain can definitely be improved.

American automobile king Mr. Ford also pays great attention to the use of soybeans. Every car he manufactures uses one "bushel" of soybeans because the by-products of soybeans can be used to make the edges of the steering wheel, the handles of the doors, the buttons of the horns, and switches. Mr. Ford once grew soybeans himself in Isaac's fields to supply his factories. When he started planting, he hired Mr. Rouse as a consultant. Now the harvest of soybean fields is becoming more and more prosperous, and industrialists and farmers all over Great Britain are paying close attention to the development of those soybean fields. Mr. Rouse earnestly said: "Soybeans are undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary plants in the world."

After translating this short article, I couldn't help but sigh: "People pay so much attention to soybeans, but we have now abandoned the treasure, and it is too late to pay attention to it."

### Village Scene

— Rui Lin

The banks of the fields are as barren as land uncultivated for a century, with wildflowers clustered among the oily green branches and leaves. Cuckoos chirp in the nearby and distant fields. The stagnant water pooled under the small bridge is dark green and calm, allowing duckweed and algae to weave a tapestry of heaven and earth. Distant like the sound of water scoops and the croaking of frogs, they sprinkle the fields like torrential rain.

Beside the algae-green pond, the graceful willow leaves, caressed by the rich oil and gentle hands of spring, sway and dance in the breeze, shattering the duckweed on the surface of the pond, like dragonflies dipping their feet into the water and buzzing. Scattering circles of water everywhere, they turn into messy waves, reflecting the broken and folded shadows of the trees.

But the fields are filled with golden wheat, and the evening breeze sweeps through, the waves of wheat near and far are turning into flowers. The farmers, silently bending over, have already shed the first few drops of sweat of late spring, with a faint smile floating on their lips. When a wisp of evening smoke spirals from the distant fields and the roofs of the farmhouses, I run to the edge of the field, and the wheat grass lying on the road is picked up by me, and then I remember my childhood home life.

I grew up from the land of the countryside. But I was sent to the bustling city to find a life. The calls of selling green plums that occasionally float past on the street make me sad, and also make me happy.

Finally, I returned to the countryside. The days in the countryside are quiet and peaceful. Every day I just walk on the banks of the fields and by the algae-green pond, feeling a kind of happy mood.

The afterglow of the setting sun remains on the treetops in the west, and the fields are a flying red. Village children ride on the backs of cows, wearing straw raincoats and blowing flutes, or humming folk songs as they go home. I yearn for that kind of uniform harmony, as if I myself am that cow-herding village child.

I walk alone on the bank of the field, that thatched cottage that entangles my memories, the barren mounds, and those May season flowers in full bloom, are my home of melancholy.
