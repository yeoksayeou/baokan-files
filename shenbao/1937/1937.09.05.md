### The Enemy Has Been Repeatedly Defeated and Has Augmented Reinforcements Three Times; Our Front Lines Are Consolidated, Awaiting an Opportunity to Strike Hard

The enemy's riverside positions have been cut off and surrounded by our forces. The enemy suffered a disastrous defeat in the air and on land, with extremely high casualties. Yesterday, enemy planes ran rampant but two were shot down by our forces.

Since the enemy troops landed in Shanghai for the second time, another week has passed. They have remained confined to a corner, unable to make any progress. Their attacks on our positions in recent days have been met with heavy blows. Their soldiers have suffered heavy casualties, and their morale has plummeted. Moreover, the enemy units in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, Wusong, and Luodian districts have been cut off by our heavy forces. Not only have they failed to realize their dream of breaking through, but the remaining enemy forces in the Luodian district have been surrounded by our forces and are in a sorry state. The enemy commander-in-chief Matsui, in defeat, has had no choice but to once again request reinforcements from Tokyo. The reinforcements, consisting of about two divisions and military supplies, arrived yesterday morning on 49 transport ships outside the port of Wusong and are preparing to land. Matsui has also announced to the foreign press that he will launch a full-scale offensive against our entire line early next week. Our frontline military authorities, upon hearing of the enemy's reinforcements, believe that it is an inevitable move after suffering setbacks. As for the announced general offensive, they consider it a form of intimidation. After arriving in Shanghai, Matsui has repeatedly issued orders for a general offensive. Between the 26th and 27th of last month, he even declared to the military authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai that the Shanghai battle would be completely concluded and restored to its original state by the end of the month. However, the current situation has fully demonstrated the futility of intimidation. In short, our army, with a spirit of not being arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat, has adopted a steady and solid approach. Even if the enemy reinforcements continue to arrive, we are determined to be ready for them and inflict heavy blows. We are confident about the future of the war.

At about one o'clock this morning, our artillery positions in Zhabei [text unclear] fired more than ten shells at the enemy positions in the Hongkou area. The enemy remained silent and did not dare to retaliate. Our side then stopped firing. After a while, an enemy plane flew over Pudong to reconnoiter, and then left after a long time.

### Luodian: We are Pressing Close to Sunjiaqiao

Confirmed information: Our army in the Luodian area is advancing victoriously, pressing close to Sunjiaqiao, and has occupied Nanchang Bridge and Tanshe Bridge, linking up with our army in the southeast corner of Luodian.

The battle of Luodian has been extremely fierce in recent days. The besieged enemy has repeatedly tried to break out, but has been repelled by our forces. Our army is launching a fierce attack from three directions simultaneously, making rapid progress. The enemy's positions are shrinking further. It is estimated that there is still a brigade of the enemy's forces surrounded. After days of fighting, they have suffered heavy casualties. Last night, our army achieved considerable success in one of the routes attacking Xiaochuanshakou. The enemy's retreat route has been almost completely cut off. Two-thirds of Luodian town is under our control. The enemy has virtually no room for maneuver in this small area. Yesterday morning, the enemy launched several fierce breakout attempts, resulting in extremely fierce fighting. The enemy was repulsed in a chaotic manner under our army's bayonet charge.

Central News Agency: Regarding the enemy in the Luodian area, after our army launched a surprise attack from the northwest corner of Xiaochuansha the day before yesterday, harassing the enemy's rear, it has completed a four-sided encirclement. The enemy launched several counterattacks the night before last, attempting to break through the encirclement. However, they were repeatedly subjected to dense machine gun fire by our army, resulting in heavy casualties and a retreat. As of yesterday morning, the enemy was still heavily surrounded by our forces. Their attempts to break out have not succeeded.

### Enemy Brigade Commander Kuranaga Killed in Action

Central News Agency reported that our army killed an enemy brigade commander during the fierce fighting in Luodian on the 29th of last month, but the name had not yet been confirmed. According to the extra edition of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun on the 30th of last month, the enemy troops fighting in Luodian consisted of three brigades, and the brigade commanders were Kuranaga, Takanori, and Takeda. The one killed on that day was Kuranaga, who was killed by our artillery fire. The extra edition of the newspaper also published a photograph of Kuranaga.

### The Remaining Enemy Forces in Wusong Collapse and Retreat to the Riverside

The enemy in Wusong, pressed by our large army, has collapsed and retreated to the riverside, gathering along the riverbanks. The enemy warships in the Huangpu River near Wusong fired on our positions the night before last, covering their infantry's advance and retreat. Our rear artillery units immediately returned fire. The two sides exchanged fire until yesterday morning, when the artillery fire subsided. Our army positions, despite being under intense enemy artillery fire, continued to pursue the enemy and advance forward, making active progress. The enemy's plan to attack Shishan and Yuepu has completely failed. Furthermore, news from the military: The enemy troops in the Wusong town area divided their forces into one route the night before last, launching a sneak attack on our positions in the southeast corner of Yuepu town. They were met with resistance from our army, and a fierce battle ensued. By dawn yesterday morning, the enemy could no longer hold out and retreated. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing many enemies and advancing our positions by two miles. The enemy did not dare to attack again. The Shishan area also remained calm. (Further news) Yesterday morning, our army again sent out troops to attack, making contact with the enemy troops at Taixing Road and Tongji Road, resulting in fierce street fighting. The two sides fought hand-to-hand until noon. Our soldiers shouted and killed, engaging in a bloody battle. As a result, the remaining enemy forces on the western front retreated to the north of the Yunzaobang Canal. On the central front, our army continued to advance along the railway. There was no trace of the enemy in Paotaiwan. According to a military officer at the front line yesterday, the enemy entrenched in Wusong will be completely eliminated soon. After defeating the remaining enemy forces on the western front of Wusong, our army has moved into the sugar factory.

### Enemy Forces Attack North Station, Retreat in Defeat

Since the enemy forces in the Hongkou area withdrew their marines and replaced them with regular army reinforcements some days ago, enemy army units that had arrived from Wusong the night before last launched an attack on our North Station area at about 3:30 yesterday morning, hoping to break through the encirclement and make another attempt. Our army retaliated with mortars, resulting in intense artillery fire. The enemy could not hold out and retreated.

At 0:20 this morning, enemy fire attacked our Zhabei area. In addition to dense machine gun fire, our artillery positions in [text unclear] also used heavy artillery and mortars to attack the enemy positions in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas for a long time. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and the attacking enemy retreated in a chaotic manner.

### A Large Number of Enemy Reinforcements Have Arrived in Shanghai

According to reliable information, 49 enemy transport ships (mostly converted from merchant ships) carrying a large number of reinforcements and munitions arrived in the waters 50 nautical miles outside the port of Wusong the night before last. As of yesterday morning, they were still anchored there, seemingly ready to launch a large-scale attack on our positions.

Two more enemy merchant ships entered the Huangpu River the night before last. One, named Gonkonmaru, docked at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. The ship was loaded with a large number of straw mats. According to knowledgeable sources, these straw mats are used to wrap the bodies of enemy soldiers who have died. Another, named Calcutta Maru, docked at the Gonghexiang wharf, carrying a large amount of military supplies. In addition, an enemy transport ship named Kiurgasa Maru sailed to the central wharf of the China Merchants Bureau before dawn yesterday morning. A large amount of military equipment was immediately unloaded. The above three ships then loaded enemy wounded soldiers and corpses, and sailed back to Japan successively at 11:15 am, 3 pm, and 5:25 pm yesterday.

### Heavy Losses Among Enemy Air Force Personnel

Central News Agency reported that, according to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, the number of Japanese air force personnel killed and missing from August 20th to 27th was as follows: 20th, three; 21st, Jurong three, Yangzhou one, Nanjing thirteen, Suzhou one, Nanchang one; 22nd, Shanghai one (squadron leader); 23rd, Shanghai two, Nanjing five; 24th, Shanghai two; 26th, missing one; 27th, missing nine; totaling 42. This does not include those who fought in Hangzhou, Guangde, and other places, which shows the seriousness of their losses.

### Major Fires in Hongkou and Pudong Yesterday Morning

The Municipal Council reported that a major fire broke out behind the Meilun Middle School at about 7 am yesterday. The major fire in Pudong burned overnight and was extinguished only yesterday morning. Fires broke out in the Haisheng Road and Oujia Road areas between 8 am. The situation was relatively calm between 8 am and 9 am. There were five or six fires between Zhoujiazui Road and Meilun Middle School. There was also a fire near the Bazilu and Hesike'er Road, which was quite intense. The following four locations also caught fire between 9 am and 10 am: (1) the intersection of Aierjin Road and Beijiangxi Road; (2) the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road (firefighters from the concession have rushed to put out the fires in the above two locations); (3) the station building of the Maigen Road (caused by bombing); (4) near the Anli warehouse in Pudong.

### Enemy Forbids Foreigners from Going to Yangshupu

The Shenzhou News Agency reported that since the Shanghai war expanded outwards, the Japanese army has allowed foreigners to freely enter and exit the Yangshupu area. However, starting yesterday afternoon, the Japanese army issued a notice warning foreigners not to enter the Yangshupu area without permission. As a result, foreigners who wanted to move their belongings from that area were turned back. It is said that foreign journalists who have passes can still enter and exit the Hongkou area, but the Japanese army will not be responsible if any danger occurs.

### In Two Days, the Enemy Suffered Over 8,000 Casualties Along the River and Coast

Most Deaths in the Battle of Wusong; Large Numbers of Corpses Thrown into the Sea

Central News Agency reported that, in recent days, the enemy attempted to complete a certain line of communication in places such as Luodian and Wusong, and launched fierce attacks on our positions. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. According to reliable sources, since the enemy began attacking our positions on the night of the 1st of this month, they have suffered extremely heavy casualties on all fronts in two days, with over 5,000 killed and over 3,000 wounded. Among them, the battle of Wusong saw the most deaths, reaching over 3,000, followed by Luodian, Zhanghuabang, and other places. A large number of corpses were loaded onto a transport ship near Zhanghuabang at about 5 am on the 3rd and sailed out of the port. It is said that these corpses were thrown into the sea outside Sanjiashui and will not be transported back to their home country.

### Enemy Planes Run Rampant, Dropping Bombs Everywhere; Two Were Shot Down by Our Forces Yesterday

Stray Bullets Fly Everywhere, Non-Combat Zones Are Also Affected; Refugee Convoys Are Also Straffed

Yesterday, enemy planes, in groups, bombed and strafed Zhabei and western Shanghai from dawn to dusk. At noon, an enemy plane flew very low over the Maigen Road area in Zhabei. Before long, it dropped a bomb and sped upwards. As it was about to continue dropping bombs, its tail suddenly caught fire, and smoke billowed around it. With its engines damaged, it plummeted like a fire dragon straight down from the sky, crashing to the ground. The bombs inside the plane immediately exploded, sending a thunderous roar throughout the city. Many citizens of the special district witnessed the enemy plane crashing. At the time, it was suspected that the enemy plane had exploded on its own. It was not until last night that a report was received from the front line confirming that it had been shot down by our forces. The reason was that at 1:15 pm yesterday, three enemy planes were flying low and dropping bombs near Zhongshan Road. Wu Qiujian, the commander of a certain regiment of a certain division of our army, ordered the adjutant Zhang Zhige and the company commander Hong Ce to command the anti-aircraft battalion to launch a surprise attack with anti-aircraft guns, cannons, and anti-aircraft machine guns. In an instant, bullets flew like snow, and the oil tank of one enemy plane was destroyed, causing a fire to break out. The fuselage was completely burned, and black smoke billowed. It fell on the cemetery of the Guangzhao Mountain Villa on Guangzhao Road. Soldiers of the regiment then found the head of the enemy plane's pilot, machine gun fragments, etc., at the anti-aircraft position, with the words "Made in Nagoya" on them. The words "December, Showa 11" were also on the burned wing of the plane. It is reported that the division sent specialists to transport the fuselage to Nanjing. In addition, another enemy plane was shot down by our army at 2 pm yesterday while flying very low and dropping bombs in the North Station area. The fuselage crashed and was burned, and the pilot died on the spot.

At around 7 am yesterday morning, more than ten enemy planes appeared over Shanghai again, circling for a long time, and carried out bombing raids in Zhabei and Huacao Town in western Shanghai. In addition to some houses being destroyed, no casualties were reported. By about 9 am, most of the enemy planes had left, but two planes continued to drop bombs in Zhabei, and fires broke out in several places.

Yesterday, several enemy planes circled over the city all day and fired machine guns indiscriminately, resulting in shell fragments and stray bullets flying everywhere in the non-combat zones of the two concessions, the South City, and Pudong. No fewer than 50 or 60 residents were killed or injured. Ambulances were dispatched everywhere, and people were extremely anxious. Details of the situation are recorded below:

Enemy planes have been bombing Zhabei, the South City, and Pudong for days. They also strafed refugees, charity groups, and rescuers who were not involved in the war with machine guns, which is truly inhumane. The two concession areas were also affected. A large number of shells, anti-aircraft shells, and shell fragments landed in the concessions the day before yesterday. The Municipal Council ambulances were dispatched to 32 locations, and a total of 46 injured people were transported to various hospitals. Most of them were injured by stray bullets. Fire engines were also quite busy. Furthermore, at 5:45 pm yesterday, an anti-aircraft shell landed on the race course, injuring two members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, W.G. Nicholls and M.P. Doyle. Also, at 2:10 pm the day before yesterday, a member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (Russian unit), Kosnyreff, was wounded by shell fragments on the Bund of Beijing Road. At 6:30 am yesterday, a bomb suddenly exploded at the back door of the Jiangnan Small Inn at the junction of the French and Chinese concessions, injuring more than ten people who were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, a hand grenade exploded at the base of the wall in Tingyun Lane near the area, killing Peng Dawei, a Yancheng native who was in the used goods business, on the spot, and injuring more than ten people. The police are now strictly investigating the source of the explosives. Also, at 9:15 am, a small cannon shell landed in the parking lot of the Hed Road tram company, but did not explode. Stray bullets also landed at the entrance of the Xinhua Bank on Heping Road in the South City, near Xiaonanmen, in Suozilong in the city, and in Hexing Lane on Jingxiu Road. It is said that these bullets were fired by enemy planes when they were flying low. The city's police departments are now conducting strict investigations and are taking meticulous precautions to prevent traitors from infiltrating and causing trouble. At the same time, between 6 am and 7 am yesterday morning, a large squadron of Japanese planes flew through the public concession area. As soon as the planes flew over various places, bombs and other explosives fell, and there were also machine gun strafing in many places, causing a considerable number of deaths and injuries. As a result, ambulances were dispatched one after another, and Renji and Baolong hospitals were almost full. The information obtained from the investigation is recorded below, and there are likely many others that have not been identified. (1) Five people were injured at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road; (2) one person was injured at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Zhejiang Road; (3) two people were injured across from the Tongchang Motor Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road; (4) two were killed and three injured on Danshui Road; (5) several were injured near the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road; (6) a ticket inspector was injured at the ticket booth of the tram company on Haig Road; (7) two children were killed at the entrance of the Dazhong Lane at the intersection of South Chengdu Road and Tongfu Road. One was Shen Ren, 14 years old, from Jiaxing, residing at No. 140 Dazhong Lane. The other was Zhou Peigen, 9 years old, residing at No. 107, Lane 638, Xinzha Road. Both children were hit by machine gun bullets from enemy planes. Locations (1) and (5) were strafed by machine guns, and the rest were injured by small bombs, which shows the recklessness and inhumanity of the Japanese planes. In addition, the roof of the Chengdu Road police station was also hit by a stray bullet at 6:50 am yesterday, which only destroyed a portion of the building, fortunately without injuring anyone. At 6:30 am yesterday, two enemy planes flew to the North Station area to bomb. When our army opened fire with machine guns, a shell fell near the Jing'an Temple, not far from the police station, injuring a Chinese man. Also, when enemy planes bombed the North Station yesterday morning, it was reported that 25 people were injured in the Xinzha area, and six were injured in the Laozha area. Several people were also injured in the Chengdu Road area. At 9:10 am, an enemy plane dropped a bomb in the air above the railway junction on Maigen Road. At 10:50 am, enemy planes dropped four bombs near the North Station. One of them fell on Aierjin Road, very close to the concession. Another one seemed to not have exploded. A total of 16 people were injured by enemy artillery fire in Pudong and have been sent to hospitals separately. The injuries of each person are as follows: (1) Gu Xia, Liu Xingren, head injured by machine gun; (2) Sun Siyuan, from Beiping, head injured by bomb shrapnel; (3) Xia Mingshan, from Shandong, left hand severed by artillery shell; (4) Xu Fulin, from Yangzhou, left kneecap broken by artillery shell; (5) Xu Fashu, from Tongzhou, left foot injured by artillery shell; (6) Li Amao, from Ningbo, left arm severed and left leg injured by bomb; (7) Xia Meidi, from Chongming, left scapula injured by gunfire; (8) Wu Li, from Pudong, left and right waist injured by artillery shell; (9) Yao Wenru, from Nantong, foot injured by bomb; (10) Wu Shiliang, from Pudong, right leg injured by artillery shell; (11) Zhang Longgen, from Pudong, right hand and leg injured by artillery shell; (12) Zhang Zhao, from Pudong, leg injured by bomb; (13) Li Jianchu, from Dinghai, slightly injured; (14) Wang Yin, from Hubei, arm and lower body injured by bomb; (15) Chen Li, from Pudong, hand and back injured by bomb; (16) Wu Jufen, local, arm and left leg injured by artillery shell.

Some days ago, when a rescue team escorted a large number of refugees from Shanghai by small steamship to Suzhou, they were followed by enemy planes for as long as three hours. At times, they fired machine guns downwards, causing panic among the refugees and nearly causing an accident. After making every effort to evade, they were spared disaster. The enemy planes repeatedly shot at our unarmed refugees, which is extremely cruel.

### There are as Many as 130 Enemy Warships and Vessels Outside the Port of Wusong and in the Huangpu River

The Number of Warships and Vessels Sailing to Shanghai is so Vast; It is Clearly Seen That They are Willing to Stake Everything

After the enemy's attempt to invade our coastal and riverside ports failed, the enemy warships in the Huangpu River launched a fierce bombardment of our Pudong positions the day before yesterday, attempting to cover the enemy's landing. After our army's calm resistance, they ultimately failed to succeed. The three newest-type destroyers of the enemy's 6th Squadrons, Hibiki, Tkodzuka, and Tnazuma, which fired the most on our Pudong positions the day before yesterday, anchored behind the Japanese Consulate, sailed out of the Port of Wusong in disappointment before dawn yesterday morning. According to an investigation by reporters yesterday, there are a total of over 90 enemy warships of all sizes outside the Port of Wusong, including the 49 transport ships (mostly converted from merchant ships) that recently sailed to Shanghai. Including the enemy warships in the Huangpu River and Liuhe area, the total number should be around 130. The fact that so many enemy warships have sailed to Shanghai further shows the enemy's anxiety and willingness to stake everything after their invasion of our country failed. The distribution of the 19 enemy warships in the Huangpu River yesterday is listed below: five floating gunboats No. 5 and No. 24, one floating destroyer No. 18 Nagasaki (belonging to the 22nd Squadron), one floating destroyer No. 15 Munisaki, one floating destroyer No. 14 (belonging to the 21st Squadron), one floating gunboat No. 11 Rotaka, two floating destroyers No. 7 (belonging to the 21st Squadron), two floating destroyers No. 6 (belonging to the 30th Squadron), one floating flagship Izumo No. 2, one floating destroyer No. 1 (belonging to the 16th Squadron), three transport ships at the Yangshupu wharf, one destroyer at the Pudong Xin Mitsui wharf, one cruiser at the Huishan wharf, one destroyer at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau (belonging to the 21st Squadron), and one destroyer at the Mitsubishi wharf, for a total of 19 ships. There were over 100 enemy soldiers at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau and over 60 enemy soldiers at the Huangpu wharf, all of whom were busy transporting military supplies.

### Yesterday, the Authorities of Various Countries Stationed in Shanghai Sent Notes to the Enemy and Us

Requesting Our Army and Enemy Warships to Move Slightly to Avoid Further Danger in the Concessions

The military authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France stationed in Shanghai, citing the fierce artillery battle between the Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River in front of the Japanese Consulate on the 3rd of this month and our Pudong artillery, which resulted in a large number of stray bullets falling in the public and French concessions, causing significant losses of life and property, requested the consuls general of their respective countries stationed in Shanghai to send notes to our country and Japan yesterday, requesting that Japanese warships should move below the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, and our Pudong troops should move east of Pudong Road and south of Zhangjiabang. It is reported that the note sent to our country has been forwarded to the military authorities by Mayor Yu.

### The Powers Are Implementing Economic Sanctions as a Just Means Against Japan

American Labor Unions Advocate Economic Severance with Japan; To Avoid World War, It is Necessary to Curb Militarism; Song Ziwen's Interview with Reporters from the American Zhiye News Agency

A reporter from the Associated Press visited Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, yesterday. He was granted an audience and made the following remarks: "The report that American labor unions are now organizing and advocating economic severance with Japan is gratifying. This proves that the common people's understanding of fundamental issues is often more reliable than the lengthy considerations of international experts. If Japan defeats China one day and utilizes its countless resources, all peace-loving countries will inevitably be greatly threatened. When the September 18th Incident occurred, those who sought temporary peace often said that after Japan annexed the three northeastern provinces, it would be busy consolidating and would have no time to invade other parts of the country. However, in fact, Japan has already occupied a large part south of the Great Wall, and is now seeking to advance and invade the Yangtze River Basin, threatening China's financial and economic center, as well as the only location where foreign businesses have made large-scale investments. Since the September 18th Incident, international morality has declined, and a world war is brewing rapidly. To prevent Japan's militarism from advancing and to eliminate the occurrence of a world war, all peace-loving people believe that economic sanctions should be implemented by the great powers advocating democracy as the only just means. It is feared that those in power will continue to adopt a hesitant and compromising attitude, repeating the same mistakes and regretting it later."

### Special Parliament Opens Amidst Reports of Japanese Military Setbacks

Debating a ¥2 Billion Military Budget: Total Amount to Exceed Expenses of the Russo-Japanese War. British and American Newspapers Comment on Japan's Risky Actions.

[London] According to reports here, the Sino-Japanese battles in Shanghai have intensified again recently. Chinese troops on the Liuhe, Luodian, and Wusong line have broken through multiple enemy positions. Chinese troops in the Pudong area also hold an advantageous position. Foreign military observers in Shanghai say the Japanese army must be extremely cautious, otherwise they will be forced to retreat into the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers. (4th, Guomin Haitong Telegram)

[Tokyo] Telegrams received here from various parts of China claim that the fighting in Shanghai has intensified again in recent days. The strong resistance of the Chinese army has been unexpectedly fierce. Simultaneously, Chinese troops have reinforced with a large amount of artillery and fresh troops. The situation in North China is relatively quiet, with only minor skirmishes along the Chahar-Suiyuan border. Japanese planes bombed the railway near Machang. The report states that neither the battles in North China nor Shanghai will be decided in a few days. (4th, Guomin Haitong Telegram)

[Tokyo] The Japanese special parliament held its opening ceremony today. Tomorrow, cabinet ministers will give speeches on the so-called "China Incident." A special military expenditure of ¥2,220,000,000 and an additional budget of ¥42,000,000 for general accounting will be discussed. The majority of the funds for the temporary military expenses will be raised by issuing public bonds. The total budget for this year will therefore reach a staggering ¥5,470,000,000. The amount of public bonds issued this year will be ¥3,300,000,000 to ¥3,400,000,000. The entire cost of the Russo-Japanese War was only ¥1,500,847,000. The total military budget for the Sino-Japanese Incident, including the previous and current appropriations, amounts to over ¥2,500,000,000, which is truly considerable. (4th, Central News Agency Telegram)

[Tokyo] According to reports here, since the "Sino-Japanese Incident" occurred, Japanese commerce has suffered a major blow, with small and medium-sized merchants and those specializing in exports being the most severely affected. So far this year, the excess of imports over exports has reached an unprecedented high of ¥77,400,000, compared to only ¥21,400,000 in the same period last year. (3rd, TASS Telegram)

[Washington] The U.S. Department of Commerce announced today that in the first half of 1937, Japan's excess of imports reached ¥175,000,000, the highest amount since 1924. During this period, Japan's exports increased by 24.4% and imports increased by 44%. Military supplies accounted for a large portion of the excess imports, including aircraft parts valued at ¥832,883. (3rd, Guomin Telegram)

[Washington] The Washington Post published an editorial today criticizing the situation in the Far East, stating that the fundamental interests of the United States and other countries are being harmed by Japanese aggression. It is necessary to assess the true nature, weaknesses, and arrogance of Tokyo. The United States and other countries must adopt a calm and resolute attitude to make Japan understand that beyond a certain point, it cannot hope for its risky actions to be rewarded. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said that all groups that believe in peace and an orderly adjustment of international relations have a matter of life and death at stake in this. How true those words are. Submissive surrender will not prevent violence, and enduring unbearable insults will not maintain lasting benefits. The actions Japan is taking now set a precedent. If they are not checked, it will only encourage other bullies to follow suit. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters Telegram)

[London] The Times commented on Japan's wartime budget of ¥2,549,000,000 today, stating that Japan clearly hopes that the collapse of Chinese resistance will guarantee an early victory for Japan. However, it is dangerous to assume that this war will be limited in scope and short in duration. Japan's aims are vague and unlimited, and the length of the war may worry the Japanese General Staff. In this continuing struggle, what Japan has succeeded in doing is closing the markets that its politicians and economists consider the lifeline of the Japanese economy. Even if Japan wins, the extraordinary expenditure of the country's treasury will not stop immediately after the war ends. Even if the land where it decides to establish its power after the victory is limited, it will have to pay a heavy price, and the work will be extremely difficult. Japan's continental policy clearly shows a certain degree of irresponsibility, and the Japanese military has begun to control other national institutions. The wartime budget is increasing dramatically. This war is a more dangerous gamble than expected. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)

[London] The Times also recently commented on the war between China and Japan, with particular emphasis on Japan's economic difficulties, saying, "China is vast in territory and resources, with a large population, and the government has unexpectedly gained the support of the entire population. Therefore, even if the country's troops are defeated, the central government may not be forced to surrender or collapse. In Japan, the very act of waging war is bound to increase the financial burden. Moreover, the war's protracted nature may not have been foreseen by the country's General Staff, making it even more difficult to cope with. Furthermore, even if Japan achieves victory during the war, the commercial markets that its politicians and economists consider to be its economic lifeline will inevitably collapse. In short, even if Japan achieves a great victory in this risky undertaking, it will be difficult to stop its policy of financial exploitation. Any attempt by Japan to establish a sphere of influence in any part of China will be a difficult and costly undertaking. Even if conquered, there is no direct benefit to be gained from organizing ruined territories in small, remote areas. Japan's unprofitable occupation of Manchuria is clear evidence of this." The conclusion is that if Japan cooperates with other countries, the benefits it can obtain will be less monopolistic but more practical than pursuing risky policies.

### Overseas Chinese Patriotism

Recruiting Aviators, Donating Preventive Medicines

[Washington] According to reports here, overseas Chinese organizations are recruiting American-born Chinese to return to China to participate in the war of resistance against Japan. The most needed are aviators and machine gunners. Two hundred people have already responded. Aviators will receive a monthly salary of ¥1,500, with additional rewards for shooting down enemy aircraft. The funds will be provided by overseas Chinese. (4th, Guomin Telegram)

[San Francisco] The Chinese American Citizens Alliance announced today that it has prepared ¥1,000 worth of preventive medicines, which will be flown to Hong Kong by Pacific Airlines on Wednesday for distribution to Chinese soldiers and civilians. (4th, Guomin Telegram)

### Indian Nationalists Urge British Foreign Secretary to Guarantee China's Territorial Integrity

[London] The Council of the Indian League has sent a resolution to Foreign Secretary Eden, requesting "full compliance with international conventions and League of Nations covenants guaranteeing China's administrative independence and territorial integrity." They have also sent another resolution to Japanese Ambassador Yoshida, "protesting against Japan's habitual aggression against the Chinese people, its violation of their territory, and the massacre of the Chinese people in complete disregard of law and morality." (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)

### Britain and the United States Said to Be Brewing a Ceasefire Movement

British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Meets with Hirota; U.S. Policy Remains Independent

[Washington] According to reliable sources from the Associated Press today, the British and American governments are currently making every effort to stop or reduce the scope of the Sino-Japanese conflict. (3rd, Guomin Telegram)

[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Japan Knatchbull-Hugessen, immediately upon his arrival, met with Foreign Minister Hirota this afternoon for two hours. The content of the discussion is unknown. (4th, Guomin Telegram)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently stated that the government has sent new instructions to U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson, advising American citizens to take advantage of the available opportunities to return home. Regarding reports of cooperation between Britain and the United States in Chinese waters, he said that the U.S. government is still pursuing an independent policy and is not shifting based on the policies of any other country. However, it is common sense for U.S. authorities to exchange information and consult with responsible authorities in other countries who are in the same position and have the same interests. "However, this kind of cooperative undertaking should not be confused with joint action." (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)

[Washington] U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced today that the State Department has issued a very strong warning to American citizens in its recent efforts, advising them to stay away from Shanghai and other war zones. Regarding rumors of close cooperation between Britain and the United States on the Far East situation, Hull said that the U.S. government's foreign policy is conducted separately and independently, but there are times when changes are made based on circumstances. The American Red Cross announced that it does not intend to send Red Cross personnel to China or hold a national fundraising campaign, but it is willing to represent Chinese relief efforts and accept donations from organizations and individuals. These donations should be sent to the Chinese Red Cross and other relief agencies. Red Cross Chairman Clayson also said that the Japanese Red Cross has refused foreign aid.

[Washington] Regarding the recent loans made by several American banks to Japan, official sources recently stated that if the Neutrality Act is not implemented, the State Department cannot prevent these banks from lending to Japan and can only exert moral pressure. Therefore, some people argue that the Neutrality Act should be implemented immediately for the war between China and Japan. Based on the above facts, their arguments have become increasingly compelling. The government originally wanted to avoid implementing the Neutrality Act and is now concerned that increasing public pressure will force the government to implement the Neutrality Act. But in fact, the Neutrality Act cannot be applied to banks that made loans to Japan or China before the start of the war, and these banks can still freely extend the terms or increase the amount of these loans in the future.

[Washington] Six American peace organizations today urged President Roosevelt to immediately implement the Neutrality Act for the Sino-Japanese war. They protested against the obstruction of the Vichytai, which was carrying airplanes and barbed wire to Shanghai. They expressed support for the President's decision to stop sending more warships to the Far East, believing that this move would increase the tension. They also said that the U.S. cannot continue to regard the conflict currently taking place in the Far East as non-warfare. The six peace organizations are: 1. National Council for the Prevention of War, 2. World Peace Movement, 3. Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, 4. Fellowship of Reconciliation, 5. Emergency Peace Campaign, 6. Committee on Militarism in Education. (2nd, Guomin Telegram)

### British Labor Movement to Formulate Political Program

Measures to Guarantee Peace; a Large Conference to Be Held for Discussion

[London] The National Council of Labor, representing three important British labor organizations, today released a report on international policy and defense, stating that the British government must have "strong armaments to defend the country and strive for collective security, and resist the intimidation of fascist countries." The report outlines a dual policy of peace and argues that countries that have suffered injustice should be asked to state their situation, and that a new system of political security and economic opportunity should be provided through the League of Nations, eliminating the horrors of war and any legitimate economic grievances from international relations. The report continues that this new system should become part of a general mediation that will relieve current international tensions and indicate the hope for lasting peace. It also argues that the League of Nations should ensure that aggressors face an overwhelming military advantage. The report further states that the only current serious threats to peace are "Germany, Italy, and Japan, and it is aware of the possibility of these three countries forming an alliance." It concludes by saying that if the Labor Party regains power, the government will not change its current military build-up plan until the international situation changes. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)

[London] The National Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to hold its annual conference in Norwich next week. The National Executive Committee of the Labor Movement has drafted a report on the international situation and is preparing to submit it to the conference for discussion. The report states that the military strength of various countries in the world is unprecedented, and the vulnerability of British national defense is also unseen before. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to continue its military build-up plan, even if the Labor Party comes to power in the future. However, if the policies pursued by the British cabinet are based on the Labor Party platform, future wars can be avoided. The report concludes by advocating the establishment of international agreements to curb the arms race. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)

### Mussolini to Visit Germany This Month

Official German Announcement

[Berlin] Official news was released stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, at the invitation of Führer Hitler, is scheduled to visit Germany in the second half of this month to meet with the Führer. The semi-official German News Agency also issued a message stating that there are strong revolutionary movements in both Germany and Italy to establish institutions for changing the lives of nations and states, so both sides maintain close ideal ties. Italy's arrival will inevitably reaffirm this. Under the leadership of the Führer, the German nation has completed its unification under National Socialism. It is a great honor to hear that the Fascist Prime Minister of Italy will soon be visiting the country. According to semi-official sources, after arriving in Germany, the Italian Prime Minister may go to Pomerania to observe the German military, naval, and air force exercises, and then come to Berlin to hold talks with Führer Hitler. However, the details of the reception have not yet been fully decided. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)

[Rome] It is widely believed that Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Führer Hitler next month will not result in a new agreement. Prime Minister Mussolini's mouthpiece, Mr. Gayda, recently published a moderate article in the Italian Daily, discussing the meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German Führer, saying that Italy and Germany do not currently face the problem of choosing between a pro-British or pro-German policy. The speculation that the German-Italian talks will produce shocking events is highly inaccurate. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)

[Berlin] According to various newspapers, the visit of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Germany has major world significance. The consolidation of the Berlin-Rome Axis, the spiritual unity of the Nazi Party and the Fascist Party, and the joint defense of peace and Western culture can all be demonstrated by this. The Local Guidance Daily said, "Only German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are the guarantors of peace in Europe. Mussolini's visit is intended to counter all acts that undermine peace with the great ideal of peaceful cooperation. There is no other purpose." The Nazi Party's newspaper, the People's Observer, said, "Since Hitler and Mussolini met in Venice, Italy, in the past, the national power of Germany and Italy has greatly increased, but the goals they seek are still the same as in the past, namely, to create a new Europe." Other newspapers all pointed out that the Berlin-Rome Axis is an element of stability in Europe and also a dawn for the future of European peace. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)

### Britain and France Convene Mediterranean Conference

Discussing Joint Action Against Pirates; Soviet Russia Prepares for Strong Measures; U.S. Also Implements Alert Measures

[Paris] The French Foreign Ministry is currently busy drafting the agenda for the Mediterranean Conference. The French Navy is playing an important role in this preparation. It is said that the purpose of the conference is to obtain a joint declaration that strongly condemns piracy and identifies the perpetrators. (4th, Reuters Telegram)

[London] Regarding France's proposal for a conference of Mediterranean countries to be held in Geneva, the British government has accepted it. Official sources recently stated that Britain will also put forward important proposals at that time, the content of which is based on mutual cooperation between the navies of the countries concerned, advocating that warships of any country on the Mediterranean coast should simultaneously protect the merchant ships of other countries, not limited to their own merchant ships. However, Britain has no intention of organizing an "international fleet" to escort merchant ships of various countries in the Mediterranean. In addition, France's original plan did not invite Italy to participate in the Geneva Conference. According to the latest news, Italy may be invited to attend. If so, the countries along the Black Sea, including Soviet Russia, must also participate at the same time. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)

[London] Regarding France's proposal for a conference of Mediterranean countries to be held in Geneva, British officials recently stated that the British government intends to put forward various proposals at this meeting, namely: 1. Submarines of all countries shall not navigate outside their territorial waters, but the boundaries of Spanish territorial waters may be slightly extended to facilitate the actions of submarines belonging to both sides of the civil war; 2. If submarines are found in the high seas of the Mediterranean, the countries concerned should impose collective sanctions, and if possible, try to sink them; 3. The countries along the Mediterranean coast should jointly issue a declaration to protect international shipping. It is said that the British proposal has been submitted to France, and France can accept it. In addition, although the parties involved in the Spanish civil war will not be invited to attend the conference, the British proposal will be submitted to both parties separately. It is heard that Spanish people expect that the Republican government of that country can accept the British proposal. British people say that the Spanish Republican government has more submarines than the Nationalist government, so the Nationalist authorities should also accept the proposal, otherwise it is tantamount to admitting that it is related to the recent attack on merchant ships. As for Italy, although Britain and France have not invited it to participate in the conference, Italian people have expressed their willingness to participate and denied being related to the attack on merchant ships. British officials believe that if Italy wants to participate in the conference, it should not be rejected. Moreover, if Italy participates in the conference and Germany remains out of the picture, the countries can take the opportunity to exert pressure on Italy to change its policies. As for Italy's proposal to hold the conference in a place other than Geneva, the countries concerned have not yet made a decision. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)

[Rome] Regarding France's proposal to convene a conference on the Mediterranean issue in Geneva, although the Italian government has not yet expressed its attitude, it is believed that if Italy is invited and it is decided that the conference will be held outside the League of Nations framework, it will definitely send representatives to participate. Italy strongly refutes that submarines of unknown nationality belong to Italy, but avoids attacking the British view. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)

[Paris] According to news received here from Athens, the Greek government has submitted a note stating its willingness to participate in the Mediterranean Conference. At the same time, the Turkish government has also expressed its agreement to participate. (3rd, Guomin Hai Telegram)

[Moscow] After Soviet ships were repeatedly attacked by submarines in the Mediterranean, factories and army and navy units held meetings one after another, passing resolutions and publishing them in newspapers. The resolutions demanded that "strong measures be taken to punish the shameless and despicable provocations of fascist pirates." Most Soviet navy soldiers volunteered to stay in service after their military service expired. Black Sea Fleet officers declared that preparations have been completed and that as soon as they receive orders from the government, they will destroy the enemies of the motherland. Workers in Leuyuk City issued a declaration, saying, "We have reached the end of our patience. Fascism is infinitely harmful to modern mankind and must be destroyed to prevent the spread of the disaster." (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)

[Washington] Navy officials recently stated that after ships of various countries in the Mediterranean were repeatedly attacked, the U.S. fleet stationed in Europe is now in a "state of alert." Although the U.S. maintains neutrality on European affairs and is not concerned, the U.S. naval fleet is allowed to open fire in self-defense. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)

[Washington] A Navy Department spokesman announced today that the captains of the ships of the U.S. Navy's European Squadron are prepared to open fire in return if they are attacked by strange submarines or other ships in the Mediterranean. However, the U.S. is a "neutral country with no relationship" and does not want to be involved in such incidents. U.S. ships in the Mediterranean, unless they have special missions, have been ordered to remain in port. (4th, Central News Agency, Reuters Telegram)

[London] Britain today dispatched the Tenth Destroyer Flotilla to the Mediterranean. At the same time, France is also increasing its naval strength in the Mediterranean to jointly protect the safety of merchant ships. (3rd, Guomin Telegram)

The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Issued a Notice Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday instructed the primary and secondary schools in this city, saying that since the outbreak of the war in this city, all schools that have fallen into the war zone or are close to the war zone have been suspended for a time. Others have also been affected by the war, and some have not yet started school.

### Common Sense for Citizens: Methods for Breaking Through Electric Fences

Avoid Contact, Do Not Use Ironware; Current Disappears When Wires Touch the Ground

The Technical Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association has specially invited experts to study the method of breaking through electric fences, as it has been found that some soldiers at the front have died from touching electric fences. The following is a special excerpt, which is also common sense that citizens must know.

When encountering an electric fence, there is no need to panic, but you must not be careless. You must not allow any part of your body to come into contact with it, and you must not use weapons, ironware, or other electricity-conducting objects to strike it, so as to avoid electric shock. You must use the following method to break through it.

(A) Complete Destruction Method

(Explanation) Completely destroy or eliminate the electric fence at its root. (Method) ㊀ Drive a tank towards the electric fence and crush it. This is the most reliable method. ㊁ Use grenades or mortars to bomb the base of the electric fence frame. As long as the electric fence frame is destroyed and the wires touch the ground, the electric fence will lose its effectiveness.

(B) Cutting off the Current Method

(Explanation) Electric fences are most afraid of the wires touching the ground. If any method can be used to make one or two wires fall to the ground, the current in that section of the electric fence will immediately disappear.

(Method) ㊀ Use a long-handled axe or non-conductive objects, such as dry wooden sticks, wooden boards, bamboo sticks, etc., to strike the electric fence heavily and destroy it (weapons and ironware, which conduct electricity, must not be used). Be sure to make the wires on the electric fence break and fall to the ground. ㊁ Take copper wires, iron wires, or chains, tie iron balls or other ironware to both ends, and throw them on the electric fence from a distance. Be sure to make one part of the copper wires, iron wires, or chains hang on the electric fence and another part touch the ground. This will make the current on the electric fence pass to the ground and disappear.

(C) Method of Avoiding Electric Shock

(Explanation) Use non-conductive objects to cover the electric fence, so that the body will not be electrocuted when crossing the electric fence.

(Method) Pile non-conductive objects, such as dry blankets, on the electric fence, and then cover them with dry wooden boards, so you can cross over. Be careful not to touch the wires.

Note

㊀ When encountering barbed wire or the like, if you do not know if it is electrified, you can use method ㊁ of (B) to test it. If it is an electric fence, there must be sparks on the wires of the electric fence when copper wires, iron wires, chains, etc. are thrown on it. ㊁ If someone has been electrocuted on the electric fence, people behind must not touch them with their hands, feet, or weapons. You must first use the above method to break through the electric fence to avoid electric shock.

### United Christian Association's Extraordinary Service

Set Up Ten Shelters, Accommodating 4,000 Refugees

All Christians in Shanghai, in order to fulfill their national duty, are engaged in services such as service and rescue in the Emergency Service Committee. According to the reporter's investigation, the organization of the association includes: ㊀ 150 committee members, organizing committee; ㊁ 21 executive committee members, Chairman Zhao Jingshen; ㊂ 7 staff members, Yang Yihui, Zhu Peien, and Chen Jisheng are executive staff members; ㊃ various specialized committees, including General Affairs: Zhou Zhiyu, Zhu Lide, Economic Affairs: Ying Shugui, Jiang Changchuan, Rescue: Diao Xinde, Wang Wanbai, Relief: Zhang Jiafu, Shi Youhui. As for accommodation, it has now accommodated approximately 4,000 refugees, totaling ten shelters: (A) Moore Church on Yuqiaqing Road, (B) Tian'an Church on Shandong Road, (C) St. Peter's Church on Avenging Road, (D) All Saints' Church on Route Lafayette, (E) Huizhong Middle School on Xieqiao, (F) Moore Chang Branch Church on Father Labour Road, (G) Xie Jin Girls' Middle School on Jing'an Temple Road, (H) Yunzhong Girls' Middle School on Avenging Road, (I) Baptist Church on Minguo Road, (J) Glory Church on Kang'nao Road.

### Gas Company Resumes Gas Supply

After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Shanghai Gas Company of the Public Concession suspended the supply of gas to avoid danger. The company has now decided to resume gas supply from tomorrow (Monday) due to the outward expansion of the war. All prices will remain the same as before and will not be increased. Therefore, those in general industry who need gas will resume work at that time.

### Commander Yang's Wife Sponsors Wounded Soldiers' Hospital

Madam Tian Shujun, wife of Commander Yang Xiaoduan, has spared no effort in national salvation work since she presided over the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association. In addition to handling refugee shelters and consoling wounded soldiers, she is now raising huge sums of money to sponsor the Fourteenth Relief Hospital, which is located on Jules Dutilh Road. The medical and various equipment are extremely complete, and all management is military, scientific, and modern. Each ward is equipped with a radio, and there are short current affairs reports every day, and leading figures and celebrities in Shanghai are invited to give national salvation speeches to encourage morale and provide spiritual training. A three-day war report is published every three days, and the Women's Mutual Aid Association organizes a choir to sing anti-Japanese songs to regulate the life of illness, so that after recovery, they can go to the front line to fight with even more enthusiasm. The hospital will open soon and is expected to be the first scientifically designed relief hospital at sea.

### Refugees in Pudong Urgently Need Relief

Most are from Hubei and Jiangbei; Hope Local Associations Will Pay Attention

Since the Hong Yang period, Pudong has not been affected by war for eighty or ninety years. The 1.28 Incident also did not affect it. Therefore, after the outbreak of this war, people from all war zones with money moved to the concession area, which is generally recognized as the safest area. Those who could not afford to live in the concession area moved to the edge of Pudong one after another. Unexpectedly, there were also occasional wars in that area, so they had to move further inland. As a result, the population in the central area of Pudong has soared, and because of traffic blockages and inconvenient transportation, prices have soared even more than in Shanghai. These people are neither wealthy nor have they suffered the hardship of several relocations, and their lives are becoming increasingly painful. It is hoped that general refugees will seek relief or repatriation from various charities. According to the survey, most of the refugees are from Hubei and Jiangbei, so it is hoped that local associations will pay special attention.

### The Front and Rear Urgently Need Winter Supplies

Monk Relief Team Aids Various Vehicles

The weather in this city has been hot and sunny during the day and cold at night in recent days, so citizens are very prone to illness. Soldiers at the front and refugees in shelters have also been affected by the cold at night and urgently need donations of quilts, padded clothes, and other winter supplies to meet their urgent needs.

The Monk Relief Team organized by the Relief Committee of the Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Disaster Association is headed by Qu Yingguang, chairman of the association. The most difficult problem for the team at present is vehicles, because there are only four ambulances prepared, and now the war zone is expanding day by day, and it takes time to travel back and forth, which makes it even more insufficient. Therefore, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously donate or lend trucks, cars, motorcycles, etc., so that the team can provide universal relief.

### Swire Chinese Employees Donate Salaries

Zheng Zhenfu and 21 Others

Zheng Zhenfu and 21 other employees of the Shengjing Wheel Management Department of Swire Company decided to deduct one-tenth of their monthly salaries to help the government fight the enemy for a long time until the final victory and the end of the war. Yesterday, the first month raised 91.1 yuan, which was handed over to this newspaper for transfer to the government.

### Yesong Factory Declares Forced Seizure of Crane

The Chinese-language newspaper Shen Bao reported that there were rumors outside that a flat-bottomed crane from the Yesong Shipyard had been leased to the Japanese army for loading and unloading heavy weapons carried by Japanese ships. Yesterday night, a staff member of the factory declared that the crane was forcibly taken away by the Japanese army without the permission of the factory personnel. The factory asked the Japanese authorities to return the machine. The machine was used by the Japanese army within the limits of the ship port and has not been moved elsewhere. It has been idle in the river near the Osaka Mercantile Steamship Co. pier for several days.

### French Envoy Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

### French Concession Authority Issues Notice Prohibiting Assemblies and Associations

Responsible for Protecting the Safety of Residents; Those Who Assemble Without Authorization Will Be Expelled

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the French Concession Authority has issued a night curfew to maintain the safety of residents and merchants in the concession, and has issued a notice stating that people in the concession must not assemble or form associations. The French authorities have now found that some people in the concession are still holding meetings without authorization in violation of regulations, and on the 2nd, they issued two more notices, which are copied as follows:

㊀ September 2, 1937, the French Consul General in Shanghai issued a notice. Based on Article 13 of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council Organization Charter promulgated on February 15, 1927, it is specially decided as follows: ㊀ In order to maintain the safety and tranquility of the residents of the French Concession, from the date of this order until the date of cancellation of the order, those who assemble or form associations without the permission of the French Concession Authority will be immediately expelled. ㊁ This order shall be enforced by the Commissioner of Police. French Consul General Baudézé. ㊁ Even though the French authorities have issued notices prohibiting meetings or forming groups, some people are still attempting to hold meetings or organize unauthorized groups. During this period, the French police are responsible for the safety of residents and will use various methods to prevent anything that endangers the safety of residents. It is hereby declared again for general knowledge. Therefore, the French authorities will no longer continue to protect those who disturb the peace by taking advantage of the protection of the French authorities and will expel them from the concession. Commissioner of Police of the Shanghai French Concession.

### Fifteen Enemy Planes Bomb Shanghai's West Side, Hundreds of Innocent Civilians Killed and Wounded

Night-Long Shelling Extremely Fierce; Our Air Force Dispatches Planes to Attack Enemy Aircraft at Night; Enemy Troops Land in Large Numbers in Wusong

Enemy troops landing to reinforce their forces have been surrounded and fiercely attacked by our army for days, suffering heavy casualties and completely losing their morale. On the one hand, they urgently telegraphed for help, and at the same time, they made every effort to use heavy artillery and aircraft to harass our positions day and night, interspersed with small-team assaults. When our army jumped out of the trenches to chase them, they quickly retreated. Most of the enemy troops were deeply entrenched and did not come out, relying on their solid defensive works to hold out for reinforcements. Last night, on the line from Jiangwan to Wusong, fierce shelling continued all night. A large number of enemy aircraft were also active everywhere, dropping bombs aimlessly, attempting to destroy our army's positions. Our army was well aware of their tricks and retaliated with heavy artillery across the entire line. Our air force dispatched planes at the same time to drive away the enemy aircraft. For a time, the sound of machine guns in the air was grinding, and the battle was fierce. After dawn, the sound of artillery gradually subsided. The enemy in Wusong, who were holding out, took the opportunity to launch an assault, but were quickly repelled by our army. The remnants of the enemy trapped in Luodian also used heavy artillery to bomb our positions. The sound of artillery was even more fierce this morning and has not stopped until noon. Our army calmly counterattacked, and the positions did not change. Also, at 7:30 this morning, fifteen enemy aircraft randomly dropped heavy bombs in Xinjing, Zhoujiaqiao, Zhongshan Road, and other places in northwest Shanghai. The rumbling sound was incessant. More than 300 innocent civilians were killed and wounded. This kind of brutal behavior by Japanese aircraft is a challenge to all mankind.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the enemy troops retreated in defeat, they asked Tokyo for help again. Yesterday, a large number of enemy ships, totaling more than 40, composed of a mixture of merchant ships and transport ships, gathered outside the mouth of Wusong. It is estimated that two divisions of reinforcements have been transported. Last night and this morning, most of the reinforcements have landed in Wusong. It is said that the order for a general attack across the entire line will be issued within a few days in an attempt to break out of the encirclement. Our army is waiting in strict formation and will give them a head-on blow at that time.

### Bloody Hand-to-Hand Combat at Wusong

Frontline Infantry Units Mixed Together in a Fierce Struggle; Our Forces Victorious

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy, after being pressed by our forces, retreated to the Wusong Riverbank and launched several extremely fierce counterattacks last night, assaulting our positions and attempting to invade Baoshan and Yuepu. Enemy warships in the river bombarded our positions with concentrated fire to cover the advance of their infantry. Our rear artillery units immediately returned fire, resulting in not only bloody hand-to-hand combat between the frontline infantry units of both sides, mixed together in a fierce struggle, but also an unprecedented artillery battle between the artillery units of both sides. Simultaneously, aircraft were active in the air, with fireballs flying and enemy aircraft illuminating the night sky with flares. After dawn this morning, the sound of artillery gradually subsided, and the enemy was finally forced to retreat. At noon today, the artillery battle between the two sides resumed and has not ceased.

The enemy, entirely surrounded at Luodian, also launched several counterattacks last night. The booming of artillery resounded throughout the night, but they remain within our encirclement.

### Enemy Reinforcements Gather Outside Wusong Estuary

Transport Ships Carry Large Numbers of Horses

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy forces fighting in Shanghai have successively deployed three reinforcement divisions. In recent days, they have been severely attacked by our forces in Luodian, Wusong, and Liuhe, suffering countless casualties. Those who invaded Luodian are even more completely surrounded by our forces. The enemy side has again telegraphed Tokyo, requesting the dispatch of two additional reinforcement divisions. This batch of reinforcements has now departed from that country for Shanghai on over forty transport ships and warships and has successively arrived in the Sanjiaoshui area outside the Wusong Estuary, choosing locations to anchor. Every two or three transport ships are constantly protected by a warship. This batch of reinforcements is currently devising methods outside Wusong to find a suitable location to advance. According to a certain ship crew member who arrived recently, he saw that several transport ships were also carrying a large number of horses, presumably for the enemy's cavalry or for towing artillery. The situation outside the Wusong Estuary is again becoming tense. Therefore, foreign merchant ships are not entering the port today either.

There have been no major changes in the enemy warships on the Huangpu River this morning. Since the Consuls-General of Britain, the United States, and France requested the Japanese side to move their warships downstream to below the China Merchants Bureau's North Bund, the Japanese side appears not to have complied yet. The Japanese flagship Izumo is still anchored at No. 2 River Pier, while the two destroyers of the 23rd Squadron at the Mitsubishi Wharf remain berthed, but have turned their bows eastward. The situation of other stationed warships in the Yangshupu Huishan Wharf area remains as before.

### Detailed Account of Enemy Aircraft Atrocities

Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao Bombed; Over Three Hundred Civilians Killed and Wounded; Bombing Still in Progress as of 3 PM

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The atrocities of Japanese aircraft continue unabated. After an enemy aircraft was shot down yesterday by our defending forces on Zhongshan Road, the enemy aircraft, with their ambitions undeterred, urgently sought revenge. At 7 AM this morning, the booming sound of bombing shook the entire city. The tranquil atmosphere of Western Shanghai was instantly shattered. Fifteen enemy aircraft carried out extensive bombing in the area west of Zhaofeng Park and north of Bailinan Road in Beixinjing. The dead and wounded were all innocent civilians, with Zhoujiaqiao, Chenjiadu, and Beixinjing Town suffering the most severe damage. According to current statistics, the dead and wounded in the two locations number approximately sixty to seventy dead and over three hundred wounded. Such cruel acts of bombing innocent civilians will be even more condemned by the world.

Zhoujiaqiao

Enemy aircraft, divided into two large groups, appeared in the Zhoujiaqiao Chenjiadu area, totaling nine aircraft. They dropped over ten bombs, killing and wounding over twenty civilians and injuring over one hundred. After rescue teams rushed to provide aid, some of the injured were sent to Renji Hospital, while others were sent to the Red Cross Hospital. Factories in the Zhoujiaqiao area that were damaged include the Far East Wood Factory, Shengchang Stone Powder Factory, and others. Other locations are still under investigation. During the bombing, villagers fled in all directions, rushing towards the Zhaofeng Park concession area. Half an hour later, the enemy aircraft departed, only to drop bombs again on other nearby villages and fields, circling around until noon.

Beixinjing

This newspaper's reporter drove to Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao around noon today to inspect the situation. However, upon reaching the western end of Bailinan Road, he was strongly prevented from proceeding by the police on duty there, who pointed to the sky and said that six enemy aircraft were still continuing to bomb various locations in the area. Even rescue workers from various charitable organizations were unable to go and provide aid. Helpless, the reporter had to stop there temporarily. However, he saw a continuous stream of refugees fleeing, carrying corpses and wounded, clogging the road. The heartbreaking and tragic scene was unbearable to witness. The reporter then met Mr. Lu, an employee of the Pushan Villa burial team, who reported that after receiving reports of many deaths and injuries from enemy aircraft bombing in Zhoujiaqiao and Beixinjing, he immediately led his team to Zhoujiaqiao to provide aid. Upon arriving, he saw corpses and wounded piled up everywhere. The tragic state was equal to that of the South Station, and all were impoverished refugees. The most deaths and injuries occurred in a disused lime kiln. The refugees, upon seeing a large formation of enemy aircraft approaching, all fled into the kiln, causing the enemy aircraft's target to be concentrated there, intensifying the bombing and strafing. Nearby thatched houses were bombed and destroyed, falling into the creek. At that time, approximately thirty corpses were collected by our team, not including the wounded. Unexpectedly, they were unable to proceed on their second rescue attempt, as six enemy aircraft were still continuing to bomb various locations in the area. As a result, over one hundred dead and wounded in the Beixinjing area could not be rescued. The inhumane actions of the enemy aircraft are truly intolerable to the world. As of this newspaper's deadline, 3 PM, the enemy aircraft were still continuing their rampage.

### Large Numbers of Enemy Troops Land in Eastern Shanghai

Possible Plans in the Yangshupu Area; A Large-Scale Offensive Appears Imminent

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the enemy's general offensive on the Wusong front failed, they have been retreating to regroup and await reinforcements. According to news from foreigners in the Hongkou district, large numbers of Japanese troops have been gathering in the Yangshupu area for the past two days. Reinforcements landing from the Dalian Mail Steamer Company Wharf in Yangshupu surged like a tide. In addition to infantry, many tanks and heavy artillery were also unloaded. The number of aircraft transported ashore for assembly was also very large. According to observations from foreigners, the enemy appears to have plans in the Yangshupu area. It is feared that once the landed reinforcements are fully distributed, the enemy in the Yangshupu area will begin a large-scale offensive.

After the enemy invasion of Shanghai suffered a severe blow from our forces, they reinforced with three divisions to China, attempting to land in Wusong, Liuhe, and Baoshan, repeating the old trick of the January 28th Incident, attempting to attack our rear. After our forces bravely resisted, they have already surrounded the remaining enemy, leaving them no room to develop. They have now again requested assistance from Tokyo, adding two more divisions to Shanghai, which arrived at the Song Estuary yesterday. A portion of them, on five enemy transport ships, sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon and night, mooring near the Huangpu Wharf, seemingly intending to reinforce the besieged enemy forces in Hongkou. As for the remaining troops, their decision on where to land is limited and undetermined. The five ships that entered the port returned to the outer port this morning, seemingly having completed their mission.

### Fierce Night Battle at Qimei Road Intersection

Enemy Incessantly Firing Guns and Feeling Their Way Forward; We Encircle from Three Sides, Killing Fifty Enemies

There had been no major contact in the Qimei Road area for several days. At around 9 PM last night, the enemy suddenly opened fire from the intersection of Dixiwei Road with hundreds of shots. Our forces disregarded this as a common tactic of the enemy. After a while, another thirty to forty enemies stealthily felt their way forward, approaching to within about 100 meters. Our forces took a three-sided encirclement formation, and in one fell swoop, slaughtered the enemies, leaving none behind. Unexpectedly, another hundred or so enemy troops chased after them, firing machine guns wildly with intense firepower. Our side also returned fire with machine guns. After fifteen minutes, the enemy retreated on their own.

At around 9 PM last night, about three hundred enemy troops suddenly invaded our positions in the Baziqiao area of Jiangwan Road, firing continuously with rifles and machine guns. Our forces remained silent. After about twenty minutes, they approached our positions closer and closer. At the sound of a bugle, they jumped out of the trenches, aiming at their targets and densely firing and throwing hand grenades and machine guns. The enemy fell to the ground in response. Our forces immediately charged forward. The enemy did not show weakness, and reinforcements arrived. Our forces fought bravely with a hundredfold effort, one against ten, engaging in a melee for an hour and a half. The enemy then collapsed and retreated, with only about a hundred survivors.

### Confirmation of Enemy Aircraft Burned and Shot Down

Our Military Authorities Confirm This Morning; Remains of Two Pilots Recovered, Names Identified

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Regarding the enemy bomber that dropped bombs in our rear areas along Hengfeng Road, Gonghe Road, and Zhongshan Road in Zhabei at 12:15 PM yesterday and crashed and burned in a vacant field on Zhongshan Road, it was confirmed by our military authorities this morning that the enemy aircraft was indeed hit in its fuel tank by the anti-aircraft unit of our □□□ Division, crashing and burning on the spot. Afterwards, the remains of the aircraft body were recovered with inscriptions such as "Showa 10th Year Nagoya Made" and "No. 48". Furthermore, two symbols were recovered on the remains of the two pilots found nearby, one named "Yamamoto Yu" and one named "Kaneko Sadaichi". Today's North China Daily News also stated that according to eyewitnesses on the scene, the enemy aircraft was indeed shot down by our anti-aircraft unit.

### Tranquility in Pudong This Morning

Most Shops Have Opened for Business; Our Military Positions Completely Undamaged

After the failure of the Japanese military's attempt to invade Pudong, the fighting has subsided, and the towns along the Pudong coast have returned to a state of calm. Tangqiao Town, which controls the important transportation route to Shangnan, had several artillery shells fall on it during the fierce artillery battle the day before, but only a very small number of civilian houses were bombed and destroyed. This morning, half of the shops on the streets have opened their doors for business, especially vegetable vendors. There were already quite a few people crowding the streets to buy vegetables. The civilian ferry across the river from Dongjiadu is also operating as usual, and the fares charged are the same as usual. Laobaidu Town and Yangjiadu Town were not affected in any way before the battle. However, because most of the residents have left, they appear quite desolate. There are still many vegetable vendors along the streets, but there are fewer customers. The Laiyidu area, which is usually the most bustling, was subjected to more artillery fire on the afternoon of the third day. Therefore, some city houses either had their roofs destroyed or their walls collapsed. There are very few residents remaining. The shops are still open for business in the morning to maintain the livelihoods of those who remain, but being in their midst is unusually quiet. To the north of Sanwanchang is a restricted area, and pedestrians are prohibited from passing through, and can only detour through the back streets. Therefore, it was impossible to see the scene after the fire at the Chunjiang Wharf. Qichang Station is closely connected to the Japanese warships in Pudong, and the residents have all moved out, which is not worth mentioning. Further east is Yangjing Town, which suffered the most damage after the Shanghai war began, because the nearby Shiba Jiantou has always been a place where bandits are harbored. This time, the bandits acted as accomplices, so Japanese aircraft went to drop bombs every day for the past few days, estimating no less than one hundred bombs, resulting in a field of rubble. These bandits then wantonly looted, but the residents had already carried away their valuables. The bandits wanted bulky furniture, beds, tables and chairs. It is said that these people cannot move the looted wooden objects to Puxi or elsewhere, so they try to hide them, so that after the situation calms down, they will resell them. These mad and outrageous bandits deserve to be killed. The above is what the reporter obtained when he observed the post-war situation in various towns by car this morning.

### Japanese People Are Tired of War

Resent Government's Invasion of China

[Tianjin] According to a foreigner who recently arrived in Tianjin from Japan, the Japanese government deceives the public with false victory news every day in order to stimulate people's emotions. However, Japanese people are dissatisfied with their government's military actions in China, and people's hearts are very uneasy. Factories and shops in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and other places are mostly closed. Slogans opposing the warlords' invasion of China are everywhere. Whenever Japanese troops are sent to China as reinforcements, the families of the soldiers all support the old and carry the young to see them off, and the crying is deafening. This is enough to prove that the Japanese people resent the government and do not like war. (Fast News Agency Telegram, 5th)

### Foreign Reporter Talks About the Spirit of Resistance of Our Army in North China

Officers and Soldiers of the 29th Army Resolved to Kill the Enemy; Guerrilla Units and Civilians Extremely Active

[Nanjing] A certain foreign reporter stationed in Tianjin, immediately walked south after the Tianjin Incident, passing through Yangliuqing, Jinghai, Chen Guantun, and Xiaowangzhuang, Chaozongqiao, Yangzha, and other places east of the Jinpu Line, investigating the actual situation of the war on the front line. After more than two weeks, he finally left Jinan and came south. Arriving in Beijing on the morning of the 4th, according to a certain gentleman, he had lived and eaten with our soldiers on the front line for two days and nights. Afterwards, he met with our military officers in various places and had a deep impression of the dynamics of the soldiers on the front line because he could speak Chinese. Our soldiers can retaliate fiercely against the enemy's invasion with the highest enthusiasm. Especially the soldiers of the 29th Army, who have been dormant for four years, are particularly excited. Although they have had no food or accommodation for 25 days since the Tianjin Incident, and the mud after the rain has reached their thighs, they still want to encourage their remaining bravery against the reinforcements and are unwilling to change defenses. They all have the determination to smash the enemy and destroy them. He also said that Jinghai County has been lost and regained by our army many times. Every time they retreat, they maintain good order. After reaching a certain location and meeting with the reinforcements, they immediately counterattack. It can be seen at a glance that this is determined according to military strategy. In addition, our guerrilla units often go out to attack the enemy, either encircling them or attacking their rear. They have repeatedly approached the Tianjin West Station. The Tianjin Japanese Alliance always says that the guerrilla units attacking Tianjin have been defeated. In fact, the mission of these guerrilla units is not to occupy any place. Once they have achieved the purpose of destruction and threat, they return safely and quickly. When talking about the bravery and composure of our officers and soldiers, a certain gentleman recounted his conversation with our artillery officer in a car on the front line. At that time, artillery shells were flying outside the car, and the car was shaken by the impact of the shells. His ears were deaf, but the officer had no fear at all. He talked calmly about his combat experience, which made me suspect that his nerves were made of iron rather than flesh. The people in the front are also calm as usual. Recently, because the farming work is not busy, many people go to the front and rear to help the troops transport and dig trenches. The authorities pay them two cents of wages per day, but most farmers refuse to accept it or ask to donate the money to war expenses. Even though I am an outsider, after seeing this scene, I could not help but shed tears of gratitude. (Central News Agency Telegram, 5th)

### Short Commentary

— Foreign Minister

Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota recently hosted foreign reporters at his official residence and made a statement, saying, "Japan's use of force against China is for the purpose of maintaining vested interests and establishing lasting peace in East Asia." These two statements are incomprehensible. ㊀ To maintain vested interests, it is necessary to use force against China. However, Britain, France, the United States, and other countries also have considerable vested interests in China. Why don't they use force? Do they not maintain their vested interests? Also, to maintain vested interests, it is necessary to use force. If one wants to invade non-vested interests, what method should be used? ㊁ To establish East Asian peace, it is necessary to use force against China. Is it necessary to go to war to achieve peace? Conversely, is it necessary to have peace to go to war? What is the meaning of this? Furthermore, after going to war, can one achieve lasting peace in East Asia? I am afraid that Mr. Hirota is not necessarily sure of this.
