The text says: 'Deep worries inspire sages, and many difficulties revive the nation. Safety and danger test talent, and the fortunes of time are often submerged. If the rule of the barbarians does not fall, how can the Han way prosper? Only our Premier, with his wisdom in Huiyang, gathered the masses in Dongjiao, his wisdom and courage soaring. Valiant martyrs, your integrity is as firm as autumn frost. You swore to die nine times, hoping to achieve a great victory. You planned to launch a heavenly crusade, intending to continue the cutting down of the Shang. How could it not succeed, leaving no traces behind? The nests were not swept away, yet loyal and virtuous were abruptly killed. Facing death as if it were sweetness, shoulder to shoulder. Your spirit terrified the barbarian court, your souls returned to heaven. Since ancient times, everyone has done their best, what is valued is the national mourning. Ah, the martyrs, your bodies are exhausted, your names glorified, buried in the green for thousands of years, on the hill of yellow flowers. Passersby weep in the rain, the sun and moon dim their light. Erect stone tablets, offer fragrant incense. Though the years change, your great achievements are hard to forget. May you enjoy this sacrifice.' (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)"

### Central Authorities Hold Joint Memorial Service

[Nanjing] At 9:00 AM on the 29th, the Central Committee and the National Government jointly held Premier's Memorial Week and a memorial meeting for revolutionary martyrs in the Central Auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Zou Lu, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Lifu, He Yingqin, Sun Ke, Wang Boqun, Wang Longhui, Jiang Zuobin, Li Wenfan, Zhang Qun, Ma Chaojun, and dozens of others, as well as representatives from various ministries and departments of the National Government, including Xu Chonghao, Xie Guansheng, Chen Youfeng, Wang Guqing, Chen Haicheng, and Huang Jianzhong, and staff from various departments of the Central Party Headquarters, including Wang Qijiang, Shen Juntao, and Shen Yuanming, totaling approximately 800 people. Chairman Zou Lu presided over the meeting. After the music was played, everyone bowed to the portrait of the Premier and the tablets of the martyrs, observed a moment of silence, and offered wreaths. Zou then gave a report, stating that the Huanghuagang Uprising was one of the most tragic and magnificent events in the history of the revolution, indirectly laying the foundation for the Republic of China, inspiring a revolutionary climax, and forming the effect of the Wuchang Uprising. The reason why the martyrs continued to sacrifice and struggle was entirely due to their belief in the Three People's Principles and their understanding of national consciousness. Therefore, the greater the pressure, the greater and stronger the revolutionary resistance. At the same time, we know that the success of the revolution requires material strength, but more importantly, it requires a central idea and purpose. As long as we disregard success or failure, regardless of life or death, and have a tragic spirit, we can ultimately overcome material deficiencies and reach the path to success. Therefore, we know that the great spirit of the martyrs is not only the foundation for nation-building but also an element of national revival. At present, the national crisis is serious, and we must encourage each other with the spirit of the martyrs, seek life from death, and complete the task of national revival.

According to Deng's interview with a Central News Agency reporter, he went to Nanjing to visit the central authorities to request instructions on the Sichuan government, and fortunately, he has obtained a satisfactory result. From now on, the central and local governments should thoroughly integrate. The central government's instructions to the local governments and the provincial government's requests to the central government have been discussed and concrete solutions have been reached. On the second day of his arrival in Nanjing, he visited President Chiang, who expressed his sincerity and said that he has always trusted Chairman Liu in Sichuan affairs and is determined to support Chairman Liu in reorganizing Sichuan. Moreover, in the current national environment, if the country is not thoroughly unified internally, it is not enough to talk about saving the country from extinction. He deeply hopes that the central and local governments must thoroughly integrate. He said that Chairman Liu has national thoughts and a deep understanding of the leader, and he is determined to reorganize the Sichuan government. The central government's entrustment is very important, and everything should be done according to the leader's intentions. President Chiang then instructed him to discuss everything in detail with Minister He and Secretary-General Zhang Yuejun. Every day he met with He and Zhang, and all problems have been concretely solved. Last night, he also met with Minister He.

The central government is very concerned about the disaster in Sichuan and has decided to provide relief. However, the disaster relief fund is only 200,000 yuan.

### Tianjin Chamber of Commerce Writes to Customs

Measures for Inspecting Private Goods of Businesses

[Tianjin] The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce inquired about the seven measures for the Customs to inspect the private goods of various businesses, as the deadline is approaching. They inquired on the 29th: 1. Many businesses have registered too many types of private goods, making it difficult to complete by the end of this month, and there are too many businesses that are not members of the Chamber of Commerce. How should this be handled? Please indicate the scope. 2. After registration is completed, the Customs and the Chamber of Commerce will jointly form a committee to inspect relief books and goods, but it is hoped that the Customs will not handle it directly to avoid misunderstandings. 3. Are there any measures to block the source of private goods outside Tianjin to prevent people from flocking to where the profits are high?

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Railways believes that since the entire Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway line has opened to traffic, it is convenient for passengers traveling north and south, and the Nanping section of the Zhegan (Zhejiang-Jiangxi) Railway is under construction. The Qiantang River Bridge will also be completed this year. After fully connecting with the provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, foreign tourists can land in Hong Kong and take the Yuehan Railway directly to Central China, Southeast China, and North China. In the future, passenger cars on various railroads should be improved. The proposal was made by Huang Boqiao, director of the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Huning (Shanghai-Nanjing) Railway Bureaus, and negotiations were held with the International Wagon-Lits Company.

Current Commentary

### The Impact of the Italian-Yugoslav Accord

— Yu

Yugoslavia, which is known as the "Balkan Axis," and its neighbor Italy have almost always been in a state of armed confrontation. Now, they are suddenly toasting each other and have concluded a political accord and an economic accord of great significance. This is a new victory for Mussolini's foreign policy. The political impact on the European situation is worthy of attention.

Yugoslavia was originally France's largest satellite in the Balkans. However, the pro-Italian policy of the former French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister inevitably disappointed Yugoslavia. After the German National Socialist Party exerted its wrist in the Balkans, giving Yugoslavia generous economic benefits, Yugoslavia's attitude towards Germany changed. After the French Popular Front came to power, Franco-Yugoslav relations improved slightly, but Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović repeatedly stated that he did not want to be involved in any opposing European groups. As long as a country can give Yugoslavia economic benefits, he is willing to be friendly with it. It can be seen that it is impossible for France to pull Yugoslavia into an anti-German group.

As for Anglo-Yugoslav relations, Yugoslavia's current regent, Prince Paul, has a very close friendship with the British royal family. Former British King Edward VIII's tour of the Balkans last summer also won the favor of the Balkan countries, especially Yugoslavia. If British diplomats continue to actively pursue a friendly foreign policy in Yugoslavia, perhaps Yugoslavia would not be drawn in by Italy. However, the British Conservatives did not pay much attention to the foreign policy of the Balkan countries. Mussolini seized this opportunity and offered an olive branch to Yugoslavia with great enthusiasm. At the same time, Germany's opposition to the restoration of Hungary was also in line with Yugoslavia's position. Therefore, Yugoslavia felt that Germany and Italy were not as formidable as they had imagined. In addition, at the meeting of the Little Entente countries last September, a common resolution was reached. If collective security is impossible, the Little Entente countries can individually pursue coordination policies within the possible scope with other countries for the sake of their own security. In view of the fact that Britain and France could not provide security guarantees and economic benefits, why not accept Italy's favor?

Among the political and economic accords between Italy and Yugoslavia, the most important benefit obtained by Yugoslavia is the first item in the political accord, namely that Italy guarantees the security of Yugoslavia's land and sea borders. The most important benefit obtained by Italy is that Yugoslavia recognizes the Italian Empire. We know that in the past, Yugoslavia was often afraid of Italy invading its territory. Now Italy has clearly stated that it respects the common border of the Adriatic Sea. Yugoslavia can certainly be satisfied. However, Yugoslavia's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia is nothing less than a betrayal of its former allies such as Britain, France, and the Little Entente, with regard to the collective security presided over by the League of Nations. Weighing the two, Yugoslavia is probably still losing more than it gains. Not only that, but Mussolini, due to the establishment of the Italian-Yugoslav accord, can both strengthen his diplomatic lineup and dominate the Balkan and Danube countries, and also let go of his hands to interfere in the Spanish Civil War without worrying about the rear. From now on, the waves of the Adriatic Sea may be temporarily calmed down, but the waves of the Mediterranean Sea will inevitably become more turbulent.

### Kodama Arrives in Nagasaki to Report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Basis for Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Said to Be Established

⊙Nagasaki: The economic observation group to China, Kodama Kenji, Shoji Otokichi, Fujiyama Aiichiro, and three others arrived in Nagasaki on the 28th. Mr. Kodama said, "I have already made a statement in Shanghai, and there is nothing new to talk about now. There are various rumors about our visit to China, but we firmly believe that this visit can serve as the basis for economic cooperation between China and Japan. As a result of the exchange of views between us and the Chinese treasure industry, we learned that Chinese treasure industrialists are willing to cooperate with Japanese industrialists. After I arrive in Tokyo, I will report everything to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but this does not have a political meaning." (29th Allied Electric)

### Japanese-Indian Conference Comes to an End

Drafting of Agreed Minutes

[Tokyo] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed Representative Yonezawa on the 25th to conduct negotiations on the basis of the final revised compromise proposal.

As a result of mutual consultations, the Indian side finally accepted the compromise proposal, which was formally announced in the name of both representatives and telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thus, the Japanese-Indian Consultation, which lasted for nine months, came to a solution. The wording of the agreement can be completed within a few days, and then both representatives will hold a temporary signing ceremony, and the outline of the agreement will be announced at the same time. As for the formal signing, it can probably be done in London in mid-May. The contents of this announcement are recorded on the left: The Japanese representative and the Indian representative met on the 27th. The opinions of both parties have converged on the renewal of the current agreed minutes and the main provisions. That is, Japan can import cotton cloth to India, and the Indian cotton connected to its import volume. The opinions on the purchase volume are completely consistent. In addition, the opinions are also completely consistent on the allocation rate of various varieties of Japanese cotton cloth that should be distinguished by item and category, and the transfer rate between different varieties. Both representatives have started to draw up new agreed minutes, and once completed, they will announce the main points. (29th Allied Electric)

### Report on the Shortcomings of the Soviet Party Branch by Stalin

Communist Party Members Are Obsessed with Construction Achievements and Neglect the Capitalist Countries' Conspiracies Against the Soviet Union

[Moscow] Soviet Communist Party leader Stalin recently drafted a report on the 3rd of this month and submitted it to the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party, severely criticizing the party's various shortcomings and strongly advocating that existing leaders should be retrained, and that the party's internal organization and policies should be reformed. The report also pointed out the success of the Trotskyist faction's various sabotage activities, in order to show that past mistakes should be reformed. Party leaders, officials, and bureaucrats should all abide by the established rules of Leninism, so as not to be exploited by Trotskyists, according to a Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 29th.

[Moscow] In the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party on March 3 this year, Mr. Stalin presented a report commenting on the shortcomings of the party branch's work and the methods for clearing out Trotskyists and other traitors. The original text has now been published as follows:

Stalin first pointed out three basic facts: First, the sabotage, subversion, and espionage activities of foreign secret agents have affected our country's entire organization, or almost the entire organization, whether economic, administrative, or even party affairs, to varying degrees. Trotskyists have played an active role in this activity. Second, foreign secret agents, including Trotskyists, have not only infiltrated lower-level organizations, but have even obtained certain important positions. Third, some leading comrades of our party's central and provincial levels have failed to recognize the true faces of these saboteurs, subversives, spies, and assassins, and have instead been calm, frank, and inattentive to such an extent that they have often personally helped to introduce these foreign secret agents to responsible positions.

Stalin then analyzed the reasons for this situation, saying, "Our party comrades, because they are too enthusiastic about economic movements and the great achievements on the front lines of economic construction, have forgotten certain extremely important facts that Bolsheviks must never forget. They have forgotten that the Soviet Union is in a capitalist environment. This means that although the Soviet Union has established a socialist system, there are still many bourgeois countries that continue to live under capitalism. They surround the Soviet Union, waiting for an opportunity to attack it, destroy it, or at least weaken its power. Our party comrades have forgotten this basic fact, and this fact is the basis for determining the relationship between the capitalist environment and the Soviet Union." Stalin then pointed out that various bourgeois countries are sending spies, saboteurs, subversives, and sometimes even assassins to the interior of other countries. He then asked, "How can these bourgeois countries be more gentle and harmonious towards the Soviet socialist state than towards their own kind? From a Marxist point of view, wouldn't it be more accurate to assume that the bourgeois countries send twice or three times as many spies, saboteurs, subversives, and assassins to the Soviet Union's rear as they send to the rear of other bourgeois countries?"

Stalin then commented on Trotskyism today, saying, "Our party comrades have not noticed that Trotskyism has long ceased to be a political trend among the working class. They do not know that Trotskyism has changed from a political trend of the working class seven or eight years ago into a crazy and unprincipled sabotage, subversion, espionage, and assassination of party members, acting on the orders of foreign intelligence agencies. Today's Trotskyists dare not reveal their true faces to the working class, dare not reveal their true goals and tasks. They try to keep the working class ignorant of their political faces, fearing that the working class, after discovering their true intentions, will denounce them as enemies of the people and drive them out." Regarding this point, Stalin reiterated the Trotskyist program revealed in the case of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center, which was to restore capitalism, abolish collective and state-owned farms, restore the exploitation system, unite with the fascist forces of Germany and Japan, launch a war against the Soviet Union, support the war, oppose the peace policy, divide the Soviet Union's territory, cede Ukraine to Germany, and the coastal provinces to Japan. They prepared to defeat the Soviet Union when it was attacked by the enemy. To achieve this goal, they launched sabotage and subversive activities, carried out personal terror against the leaders of the Soviet regime, and acted as spies for the German and Japanese fascist forces. All of this is the Trotskyist program of today, as revealed by Pyatakov, Radek, and Sokolnikov.

Stalin asked, "Why have we not paid attention to all of the above? Why have we completely forgotten it? The reason is that in recent years, our party comrades have focused all their efforts on economic work and have been obsessed with economic success. Because they are obsessed with economic success, they have forgotten everything else. Because they are obsessed with economic success, they have begun to think that this is everything, and as a result, they have not paid attention to the Soviet Union's international situation, its capitalist environment, the intensification of the party's political work, and the tasks of fighting against sabotage activities. They assume that the importance of such issues is second-rate, or even third-rate."

Stalin particularly severely criticized the tendency to be complacent and arrogant, to underestimate the enemy's strength and overestimate one's own strength, and the result of this political blindness when great and important successes are being achieved in socialist construction.

Stalin pointed out the methods for clearing out these shortcomings, saying, "First, we must turn the attention of our party comrades, who are obsessed with the routine of various departments, to important political issues of international and domestic nature. We must raise the party's political work to the proper height, starting with political education and the Bolshevik training of party affairs, Soviet, and economic cadres as the basis."

"We must shatter and discard the following bad theory: that if we move forward a step, the class struggle in our country will become more silent; the more successful we are, the more docile our class enemies will be. On the contrary, the more we advance, the more successful we are, the more angry the shattered exploiting classes will become. They will more quickly adopt more acute forms of struggle and will be more disruptive to the Soviet regime, using more desperate means of struggle as a last resort. We must shatter and discard the following bad theory: that Trotskyist saboteurs have no reserves and have exhausted their last cadres. Trotskyists do have their reserves, first of all, the remnants of the shattered exploiting classes in the Soviet Union, as well as various groups and organizations abroad that are hostile to the Soviet Union, such as the Trotskyist counter-revolutionary Fourth International, two-thirds of whom are spies and subversives; and the gang of thieves in Norway, such as Chevrov, who protected the super-spy Trotsky himself and helped him disrupt the Soviet Union; and the group of Sulvarin in France, and the large number of gentlemen in Germany, such as Rose, Fish, Maslov, and Upensky, who sell their bodies and souls to the fascists. Can these people not provide reserves for Trotskyist espionage and sabotage work? And all the literary gangsters in the United States, led by the famous thief Eastman, who specialize in attacking the Soviet working class for a living, can these people not provide reinforcements for Trotskyism? This bad theory that Trotskyists have exhausted their cadres cannot be established and must be discarded immediately."

Stalin finally suggested implementing the entire method system of leading party affairs cadres and promoting new leading staff. He concluded by saying, "We will now further enumerate the necessary basic measures to clear out the subversive, destructive, espionage, and terrorist activities of the Trotskyist fascist secret agents of foreign intelligence agencies, making them harmless. We possess all the necessary means to realize these measures." (TASS dispatch on the 29th)

### Tensions Between the German Church and the National Socialist Party Are Increasing

Various Bishops Publicly Declare Resistance, Denouncing it as Sabotaging the Concordat

[Berlin] Catholics and Christians in Germany reaffirmed their religious beliefs and resisted the National Socialist Party on Easter. Yesterday, Sunday, the Catholic Bishop of Berlin, Blessing, read a statement denouncing the National Socialist Party for sabotaging the concordat, and asked students and parents to protest to the authorities and prevent the National Socialist Party from succeeding in its plot to destroy church schools. It is reported that the bishop openly ordered Berlin Catholics to resist the National Socialist Party, which is the first time since the outbreak of the conflict. Crowds gathered outside the church and cheered the bishop, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The same scene occurred in the Catholic Church in Munich on the same day. Archbishop Faulhaber, chairman, and Munich Bishop Lindau gave speeches, saying that the Catholic Church must continue to fight, even if it means sacrificing their lives. The Easter announcement that the Evangelical Church had planned to distribute, which informed the clergy of what should be done in the Easter prayer meeting, has been confiscated by the police. German Orthodox Pastor Niemöller read out the names of the clergy who were still being detained or expelled from the church in the Dahlen Church, and asked the crowds to pray for these oppressed people. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 29th)

[Berlin] Today is Easter. Judging from the situation in which religious ceremonies were held in churches throughout the country, it can be seen that the relationship between the National Socialist Party authorities and various churches such as the Catholic and Christian churches is still quite tense. When the grand mass ceremony was held at the St. Hedwig's Cathedral here, the Bishop of Berlin, Blessing, made a statement regarding the prohibition of the establishment of schools by the Catholic Church by the National Socialist Party authorities, and cited the papal encyclical issued the other day, saying that this move by the National Socialist government was a violation of the ecclesiastical agreement signed between the Vatican and Germany. Although the papal encyclical was very persuasive, the German government ignored it and still refused the church's right to participate in the education of believers' children. This situation is very serious and worrying. Believers who are fathers and brothers must submit written protests to the National Socialist Party authorities. Blessing continued to mention the education system in the Saar region, saying, "The Archbishop of Saarbrücken has repeatedly negotiated with the authorities orally and in writing, but all protests from the Catholic Church have been ignored by the authorities and have not been answered. The fairness solemnly guaranteed by the Vatican and Germany has now been completely destroyed. This cannot be explained from the standpoint of either Christians or German nationals. "In addition, Cardinal Faulhaber also declared at the Easter Mass held in the Cathedral of the Monk City that the Catholic Church would never give up its struggle to uphold Christian doctrine. As for the Christian Church, Pastor Niemöller of the Protestant Church read out to the public today the list of Jesus pastors and believers who are currently being held in detention camps, and asked all believers not to forget to pray for them when they hold prayers. In addition, the Protestant Church had a bulletin printed, which was originally intended to be published on Easter, but was suddenly searched and confiscated by the police today, so it did not come to fruition. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th)

⊙ Vatican City: The Easter Mass was held in St. Peter's Basilica this morning, and Pope Pius XI personally participated and blessed the believers. It is reported that the Pope suffered from severe gout and was on the verge of danger. He has recently recovered, but his body has not completely recovered, and he is already eighty years old, so he cannot bear the effort. Therefore, after returning to the palace from the church this morning, he rested in bed and did not get up all day. The imperial doctor examined him in the afternoon, but other than an increase in asthma compared to before, his general health was still quite good. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th)

[Rome] Pope Pius XI of Rome attended the Easter Mass in St. Peter's Basilica today, and the number of people who attended the church was extremely large, which is rare in the past. This was the first time the Pope participated in a public grand ceremony after his illness. The Pope sat upright in his seat and retired after the ceremony was completed. After the Mass, the Pope gave a blessing to the crowd, and more than 150,000 people participated. The vast square in front of St. Peter's Basilica was crowded with people, and there was almost no space left. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th)

### Commemoration of the Sinn Fein Uprising in South Ireland

Clash Occurs

⊙ Dublin: Yesterday was the 21st anniversary of the Sinn Fein uprising in Ireland in 1916, and a grand ceremony was held here to commemorate it. It was presided over by Executive Yuan Chairman Valera. In advance, the Ministry of Justice prohibited all demonstrations to prevent incidents from happening. However, Republicans disregarded the ban and still attempted to demonstrate near Newport and Castlerea, and clashed with the police. As a result, more than 20 demonstrators were injured and more than 40 were arrested. Many policemen were also injured. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)

⊙ Belfast: Disturbances have occurred every year on Easter Sunday since the 1916 riots. This year, in various parts of Northern Ireland, the Republicans attempted to hold demonstrations and clashed with the police. The situation in Belfast was particularly serious, with more than 20 people seriously injured. The police finally used batons to disperse the crowd. About 800 Republicans, including women and children, wanted to go to the graves of the martyrs who died in the Easter uprising. The police immediately stopped them and tightly guarded the surroundings of the grave. The crowd knelt in the streets and requested that the crowd leaders want to make speeches, and the police immediately arrested them. The crowd then attacked the police with stones. After the police reinforcements arrived, order was restored. Since then, armored vehicles have been patrolling the streets all day long, and various gatherings have been banned.

### Indian Political Turmoil

Muslim Leaders Also Oppose the Government

⊙ Bombay: Sir Teslavi, leader of the Muslim group in the Provincial Assembly, has today expressed his refusal to Bombay Governor Brabourne's invitation to form a cabinet in the province, thereby further deepening the Indian political turmoil. Previously, Governor Brabourne had invited the leader of the People's Party, Colonel Kerr, to form a cabinet in the province, but he also failed because he was unwilling to allow the exemption of emergency powers under the 1935 Constitution. The same deadlock has occurred in the provinces of Nasir and the Central Provinces. Nehru, the leader of the left wing of the People's Party, is now opposing the leader of the anti-revival, resolutely refusing to compromise with the authorities, and saying, "The sham of civil rule under the false constitution has been torn apart, and the hideous face that makes people hate it has been completely revealed." It is said that Gandhi has also abandoned his original advocacy of peace and is quite satisfied with the current rapidly changing situation. As for the crux of this political turmoil, it lies in the veto power granted to the governors of each province by the anti-Liu constitution of the progressive elements in India. This veto power allows the governors to take unilateral actions regardless of the will of the provincial cabinet. (National Telegraph on the 29th)

### American Newspapers Comment on Naval Issues

Hope Naval Countries Sign New Treaty

[New York] The New York Public Opinion Forum Newspaper published an article by the famous reporter Warner, commenting on naval issues, stating briefly, "The 1930 London Naval Treaty expired at the end of last year, and the United States is no longer bound by it. However, the government authorities are now hoping that a new treaty can be established between the naval countries to limit naval armaments. To this end, the Navy Department has obtained the consent of the White House to temporarily abide by the quantitative restrictions contained in the 1930 London Naval Treaty. The construction of ten cruisers originally planned will be temporarily postponed. That is, the naval budget bill proposed by the Navy Department will not be submitted to Congress for discussion at this time. Official sources also hope that countries around the world will conduct negotiations in the next 12 to 18 months in order to stabilize the world's armaments situation, as well as the political and economic situation. The United States seems to hope that Britain will take the lead in initiating this negotiation, and the United States will naturally be happy to support it in order to promote its success."

### Japan Refuses to Limit Gun Positions

British Newspaper Publishes Commentary

[London] The Daily Telegraph published an editorial today, speaking of the serious consequences of Japan's refusal of Britain's invitation to comply with the 14-inch large-caliber cannon limit, saying that in addition to the British battleships currently under construction, the caliber of the cannons can be increased to 16 inches, and sooner or later there will be a country whose battleship tonnage will exceed the limit of 35,000 tons per ship. The danger of competition between cannon caliber and hull tonnage is regrettable. Over time, the cost of building battleships will double and be unlimited. No country will gain anything from this. Ultimately, the relative position of the competing countries is almost the same as when the competition first started, but none of the countries is not poorer. What kind of benefits does Japan want to gain by comparing its power with a wealthy and powerful naval country such as the United States? It is difficult to guess. Not recognizing the treaty's restrictions is perhaps an expression of prestige, but the world's actual restrictions still exist. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 29th)

### The Next Great War Will Be Decided by the Air Force

British Government Plans to Move the Capital to Scotland

[London] It was learned today that Britain has made advance preparations to move government agencies from London to a secret location on the Scottish border in times of crisis, because experts believe that the next war will be an air war, so this preparation has been made. Canadian Prime Minister King stated in the Canadian House of Commons that if another war breaks out in Europe, Britain does not intend to send troops to the European continent. This point has also been confirmed by the Navy Department. It is reported that if Britain intervenes in European wars in the future, the air force will be dispatched to attack the enemy's airfields to prevent the enemy's bombers from leaving the ground. Britain is most concerned about not allowing enemy countries to occupy airfields in the Netherlands and Belgium and attack Britain. However, most experts believe that even if a war breaks out, it will be at least five years later. (National Telegraph on the 28th)

The culprit is a German spy; 30 officers were killed; the rebels ban Charlie Chaplin films.

[London] The diplomatic correspondent of the Manchester Guardian recently announced that a conspiracy has been brewing in the Nationalist-controlled area of southern Spain, particularly around the port of Malaga. A large number of officers under General Franco were involved. The aim of the conspiracy was to release all the prisoners held by the Nationalists and to launch an uprising in the rear to harass the Nationalist army. The matter was discovered by German intelligence, and the Nationalist government preemptively carried out arrests and executions, particularly strictly in the city of Malaga. At least eighteen leaders of the conspiracy have been killed. It is reported that the German intelligence agency that discovered this conspiracy had already infiltrated Spain and was actively operating in the country long before the outbreak of the Spanish civil war. (Central News Agency, Havana, 29th)

(Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

[Paris] The newspaper today reported that the Spanish rebel authorities have banned the screening of films starring Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Paul Muni in their controlled territory because these movie stars have aided the government army. (National News Agency, 29th)

⊙ Valencia: The government army began its offensive against the rebels by land, sea, and air today. The infantry has advanced to the outskirts of Algeciras and is about to occupy the entire city. The navy is shelling the ports of Malaga and Melilla in Morocco. (National News Agency, 29th)

⊙ Bayonne: The Spanish ship "Malgas Bibo" loaded 2,000 tons of coal from Newcastle, England, and was transporting it to the Pugo ironworks in France. Today at 2:30 AM, when it arrived off Cape Breton in the Landes department of southern France, it was suddenly attacked by two Spanish Nationalist gunboats within French territorial waters. They fired a total of fifteen shots, hitting the ship's hull at the waterline. The ship then ran aground near the north breakwater of the Adour River estuary. One of the Spanish Nationalist gunboats, named "Galena," continued to strafe with machine guns. However, out of the thirty-four crew members of the "Malgas Bibo," only two sailors suffered minor injuries due to a steam pipe explosion on the ship; the rest were unharmed. Although the ship is aground, there is widespread concern that it cannot be towed out, and there is a risk that it will sink completely when the tide rises tonight. Moreover, when the gunboat opened fire, the sound of gunfire was clearly heard here. (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

### U.S. Auto Industry Labor Negotiations Proceed Smoothly

Right-wing union opposes strike

⊙ Lansing: Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, has gone to New York today. Before leaving, he instructed his deputy to continue negotiations to resolve the strike situation at Chrysler Corporation plants in the Detroit area. Michigan Governor Murphy also believes that a solution is not far off. Lewis and Martin, president of the United Automobile Workers of America, did not criticize the statement made by William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, in Washington, which said that "sit-down strikes" are illegal actions. (National News Agency, 28th)

⊙ Lansing: Negotiations to resolve the Chrysler auto company strike continued today, the fifth day of negotiations. Michigan Governor Murphy said at today's meeting that the only issue that has not yet been agreed upon regarding the auto union's request for absolute bargaining rights is the wording. Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, who was originally the labor leader in these negotiations, has gone to New York to attend the wage meeting of the Miners' Union, as Lewis is also the president of the Miners' Union. However, the auto industry meeting will continue tomorrow, undeterred by Lewis's absence. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 28th)

⊙ Lansing: Regarding the Chrysler auto plant strike, negotiations are currently being conducted by representatives of the factory and labor, namely Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization. Secretary of Labor Perkins said that an agreement could be reached today, but so far, the two sides have not yet agreed on a solution and will continue talks tomorrow. Lewis has gone to New York and has entrusted his assistant to preside over the negotiations on his behalf. (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)

[Washington] William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, announced for the first time today that the union opposes "sit-down strikes," saying that such strikes hinder the interests of workers, so the union does not support them. The union's reasons are as follows:

㊀ The public opposes sit-down strikes, so workers will lose public support.

㊁ Sit-down strikes may be temporarily successful, but because the public cannot permanently tolerate the illegal occupation of other people's property, they will ultimately be detrimental to the labor movement.

㊂ If such methods continue to be used, they will inevitably lead Congress to enact laws such as compulsory arbitration to suppress unions.

Therefore, Green opposes sit-down strikes both in his capacity as president of the American Federation of Labor and in his personal capacity. (National News Agency, 28th)

### Further Report on Smuggling Incident in Cang County

Two dead and one wounded among smuggling rōnin; the militia seized guns, bullets, and smuggled sugar.

Regarding the clash between the militia of Jiuzhou, Cang County, and Korean smugglers while carrying out anti-smuggling duties, we reported yesterday via our Tianjin correspondent. We have now received a further communication from Cang County, along with photographs of the case, which we will report as follows:

On the 11th of this month, two militiamen stationed in Jiuzhou went to the North Gate area and saw two cars full of smuggled goods speeding east. They went forward to investigate, but unexpectedly, the private security team within the cars suddenly opened fire. The militiamen quickly took cover in a roadside ditch. Then, four or five people in the rear car fired their guns left and right. The front car also fired multiple shots backward and drove away. At this time, bullets rained down. The front car suddenly stopped by the roadside, and the militiamen went forward to check and found that the Korean driver, Li Zhongyu, had died from a stray bullet. Park Heung-bok and Kim Young-chan were also wounded in the legs. Wook Kim Young-chan also died. Inside the car, they seized a No. 2 Browning pistol, sixteen bullets, four spent bullet casings, nine pistol bullet casings, a car, and twenty-eight packages of smuggled sugar. They reported to the county and then to the provincial government for legal inspection and photography. The county government also arrested the militia involved in the incident for strict interrogation. At the same time, the injured Park Heung-bok was sent to an American hospital for treatment. On the 13th, Onozaki Fumima, the judicial director of the police station of the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin, along with many Japanese and Koreans, went to Cang County to investigate. The provincial government also sent Councilor Chen Qingyun to investigate the truth. The bodies have now been transported back, and the injured person has recovered and been discharged from the hospital. However, members of society believe that smuggling has been rampant in recent years, hindering customs duties and local security. They all hope that the authorities will seriously negotiate to eliminate the source of the problem. Otherwise, rōnin protection teams will act arbitrarily, which will not only cause trouble in the area but also hinder friendly relations in the future.

### Effectiveness of Shantou Public Smuggling Prevention

Anti-smuggling associations are all over counties, cities, towns, and villages; unscrupulous merchants have surrendered and started paying taxes.

Shantou Correspondent: Since last autumn, the government has intensified its efforts to combat smuggling, transferring 1,000 armed anti-smuggling personnel, distributed across coastal counties of Chaozhou region. Key points on land and water have been set up as checkpoints, and three warships have been dispatched, anchored off Nan'ao, Raoping, and Chaoyang seas. Chaozhou Customs has also increased the number of investigators to jointly combat smuggling. Various merchant guilds, trade unions, and others have voluntarily organized anti-smuggling associations, assisting the government's insufficient manpower, automatically cutting ties with unscrupulous merchants, refraining from smuggling goods, and establishing regulations, signing five-shop, five-person joint guarantee methods, supervising each other, and severely punishing harmful elements. Unscrupulous merchants have suffered severe blows, with goods piled up like mountains, unable to move, unable to be received, and unable to be sold. Among them, various secret organizations have automatically disintegrated and disappeared, and have ended themselves one after another. Some have suffered excessive losses and are unable to stop, leading to internal strife. Some insist on their superior position, always being special and unwilling to pay taxes. Some advocate negotiating with our side, without considering the friendly relations between the two countries. Some advocate temporarily holding out, waiting for the opportunity to come and reorganize. Some voluntarily surrender, report taxes to the special tax bureau, and maintain commercial ethics. Currently, the business of special foreign firms in Shantou City has all stopped. The largest joint-stock company, since tens of thousands of pieces of soybean and soybean cake were shipped in mid-January, no second batch has been seen. The soybeans are stored in the Wuqiao warehouse, and those near the damp ground have gradually become moldy. When soybean cakes are in high demand during the Qingming Festival, it is also impossible for the soybean cakes in the warehouse to be sprinkled into the fields. Unscrupulous merchants painfully feel that all their capital will be lost, and what they have been engaged in for years has already suffered huge losses, so they secretly sell them at low prices and automatically report taxes to the agricultural special tax bureau, obtain shipping permits according to legal procedures, and hand them over to willing buyers. Compared with the armed escort and overweening ambition of the past, there is a world of difference. It can be seen that strict smuggling prevention can indeed achieve remarkable results. Since the anti-smuggling organization in Chaozhou and Shantou has been effective, the provincial government specially issued an order yesterday to all counties in the province to follow the anti-smuggling regulations of the Shantou silk and cloth industry and automatically organize themselves in various market towns to put smuggling to death. Moreover, within Shantou City, thirty-eight trade associations have formed anti-smuggling associations. Because the nature of each business is different, the regulations are also different. Seven transport unions have automatically organized seven anti-smuggling associations. Each anti-smuggling association sends personnel to various market towns in the interior to organize anti-smuggling branches, quickly connecting to Shantou. Because the branch associations in each county and industry are being organized, the Chaozhou-Meizhou Federation of Industry and Commerce Anti-Smuggling Association is set up in Shantou City. This month can be established. The composition of the association, horizontally, has more than 50 industrial and commercial groups, and vertically, with each industry as the foundation, has branch associations of counties, cities, towns, districts, and villages. The Joint Anti-Smuggling Association also adopts a close liaison posture with military, political, and party anti-smuggling agencies. This is a good phenomenon of the people of Chaozhou and Meizhou uniting to assist the government. At present, the tax revenue of Guangdong Province and Chaozhou Customs has increased more than doubled compared to the same period last year. The monthly income of the Shantou Agricultural Tax Bureau has reached 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. Special smugglers have disappeared. However, those who smuggle drugs, saccharin, and other prohibited items by steamer, and those who buy copper coins, tungsten ore, and metal exports are still being cracked down on daily. The government executes these people with extreme punishment, without showing tolerance. During the Lunar New Year, more than 100 suspects were arrested in Shantou, and not one was released. Those listed on the smuggling activity roster in each county, once arrested, are waiting to be offered up. Very few slip through the net. Unscrupulous merchants are terrified, and those who have dealings with rōnin often automatically take refuge in other ports. Therefore, a solemn atmosphere now prevails everywhere.

### Recent Four Battles of the Northeast Volunteer Army

Japanese troops stationed in Sanxing were suddenly attacked; volunteer armies are also active in Shenyang and Changchun

The Zi Lin Daily's Harbin dispatch on March 20th reported that earlier this month, the military authorities released a report on the activities of anti-Japanese elements, stating that the number of attacks in the past twelve months had decreased. However, as the weather warms up, their activities will certainly be more severe than before in order to obtain a safe place. However, the bustling commercial town of Sanxing, near the Songhua River, where no less than 500 Japanese troops are stationed, was suddenly attacked by 400 anti-Japanese elements, which was beyond the expectations of the authorities. These men were very careful in their deployment. Their sudden arrival caught the Japanese garrison and police off guard. Several local Japanese residents fled in panic to the Japanese military camp, but before reaching the camp, several people were seized by the bandits and held for ransom. When the attackers arrived in the town, they engaged in street battles with the police, killing one Japanese police chief. The number of police dead and wounded is unknown. The attackers preemptively occupied strong points and set up obstacles on the road, so they began to rob Japanese stores and set houses on fire. When the army arrived on the scene, key points had been equipped with machine guns, making it very difficult to approach the enemy. The attacking army's weapons were very sophisticated, and they fought extremely bravely, so the regular army was only able to force the enemy to retreat after dozens of hours of fighting. As for the casualties, because the authorities had issued strict orders not to disclose anything, news about this battle could not be ascertained. However, a total of 1,000 people participated in the battle, and both sides used machine guns to fire at each other, so it is expected that there were many dead and wounded. While the fighting in Sanxing was going on, news came from Shenyang that a small team of soldiers fought with about seventy anti-Japanese elements in a forest about eighty miles northeast of Shenyang. The enemy was well-equipped and fought bravely for several hours. In this battle, one Japanese soldier was killed and six were wounded. It is not known whether there were any dead or wounded among the enemy. Also, a Japanese detachment fought with the anti-Japanese army near Huaniupu (transliteration) on the Changchun-Tumen railway line. According to official documents, the battle was very fierce because the enemy army had machine guns. Seven Japanese soldiers were wounded, two of whom are unlikely to survive due to their serious injuries. Twenty enemy soldiers were killed. Also, according to a reporter for the Japanese Nichinichi Shimbun in Qiqihar, an anti-Japanese volunteer army fought fiercely with the police near Qiqihar, killing and wounding twenty-seven police officers.

### Jiading

Captured Former Riotous Communists

Now he secretly returned to his home in Liuqiao. The county police station learned of this, sent police to arrest him. Li heard the news and fled southeast. Director Chen telegraphed the police in Fangtai, Malu, and Nanmen to encircle and arrest him. He was arrested at the Yajing Temple and brought to the station for interrogation. He confessed that he was 29 years old and did not deny participating in the major riot in previous years, but after being wanted, he first went to the Northeast, then to Tianjin, and recently to Henan, where he worked peacefully and did nothing illegal. According to Director Chen's confession, he is investigating his recent activities. If he has truly repented, he will be given a chance to start anew.

### Correspondence

Official Letter from the Hefei District Court Prosecutor

To the Esteemed Editor:

Regarding the case accepted by this office, involving Li Haohua and others embezzling donations intended to support General Ma Zhanshan, there is an official letter for General Ma Zhanshan that needs to be delivered. As we lack a confirmed address, we are writing to request that your esteemed newspaper publish this notification so that General Ma may read it and promptly respond to our inquiries, which would greatly assist the litigation process. Your assistance would be deeply appreciated.

Respectfully,

Tan Xinzhen, Chief Prosecutor

March 27th

Addressed to the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper Office

Enclosed: Letter to General Ma Zhanshan

To the Esteemed General:

Regarding the case accepted by this office, involving Cheng Jinbo and others accusing Li Haohua and others of embezzling donations intended to support General Ma Zhanshan, Cheng Jinbo and others have stated that, last year, the soldiers in Suiyuan were bravely defending the territory against the enemy, and local people, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, initiated a donation drive to support Suiyuan. Local people, understanding the greater good, readily opened their purses. Many mentioned that after the Mukden Incident, an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement was organized in Hefei. At that time, 8,000 yuan was raised in cash. Li Haohua and other committee members of the movement withdrew 7,000 yuan from a money house and remitted it to General Ma Zhanshan's office in Hailun. However, General Ma withdrew from Hailun, so no one received the funds, and the post office returned it to its origin, whereupon Li Haohua and others embezzled it for themselves. They also emphasized that while the Suiyuan donation receipt was issued, it was necessary to carefully handle the matter to ensure that the funds reached the soldiers at the front and were not embezzled by private individuals again. The complainants, facing public condemnation, had no choice but to request a thorough investigation to clarify the truth and falsehoods for the public, so that the future of the patriotic movement would not be hindered.

The accused, Li Haohua and others, argued that they did withdraw 7,000 yuan in cash from the money house and remitted it to General Ma Zhanshan's office in Hailun on December 28th of the Republic year 20 and received a reply telegram from General Ma on January 7th of the Republic year 21: "To the Hefei Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement: Received and acknowledged your telegram. Deeply grateful for the generous donation. I have instructed my subordinates to go to Harbin to arrange for transfer. [Signed] Ma Zhanshan.” However, they continued, the National Salvation Movement has been reorganized several times. The complainants left Hefei one after another due to employment issues. Although the remittance slips and related documents are untraceable for verification, it would not be difficult to directly request them from General Ma to prove that no embezzlement occurred.

Because this case is attracting public attention and is of great importance to the future of the patriotic movement, this office is handling it with special care. We have long admired your dedication to resisting the enemy and saving the nation. We trust you will not be deterred by the tediousness and will quickly instruct the personnel who handled the remittance of donations at that time to investigate whether the Hefei National Salvation Movement remitted 7,000 yuan in the winter of the Republic year 20, or if only a remittance telegram was received and the original funds were returned. Also, please confirm if the aforementioned reply telegram exists. Please reply with a letter to facilitate the handling of this matter. Your assistance would be deeply appreciated.

Respectfully,

Tan Xinzhen, Chief Prosecutor

Addressed to General Ma Zhanshan

### The Tianjin Team's Well-Organized Play Leads to Another Victory Over the Military Combined Team

Score of 5-1, the Military Team's Defense Proves Weak; Jiang Lu Scores Four Goals; Tianjin Team Returns North Last Night

Yesterday, the Tianjin Interport Football Team defeated the Military Combined Team represented by Lau Er by a score of 5-1. Jiang Lu, the only Chinese player on the field, scored four goals, earning enthusiastic praise from the 3,000 to 4,000 spectators at the Recreation Ground. This trip began with an 8-3 victory over the Shanghai Interport Team, followed by a 2-2 draw with the Shanghai Chinese Team. Yesterday's match was their last two games. That night, they boarded the Shanghai-Beijing train for a triumphant return north. This winning record has created a very positive impression among Shanghai football fans.

The Tianjin Team is Well-Organized

The Tianjin Interport Team has a well-organized and responsive system, and their agile forward line has contributed to their glorious victories. Although the military team launched fierce attacks in yesterday's match, they could not penetrate the penalty area and had few opportunities to shoot. Even when they did, they were unlucky, and their shots went wide. Furthermore, their inner defense was weak, and the goalkeeper seemed non-existent. When the opposing team approached, trouble quickly ensued. The score of 5-1 was the natural result. Without the penalty kick in the first half, they would have undoubtedly been shut out.

First Half Score: 2-0

The military team kicked off first and showed great momentum. However, the Tianjin team soon took the initiative and displayed their prowess. Huo Wei initially missed an attempt at the goal, trying again and again without success. Jones's header hit the goalpost and bounced back. The situation was intense, and the military team struggled to defend. Eventually, Jiang Lu received a pass from Jones and scored the first goal. The military team launched fierce counterattacks, their momentum surging, and they came within inches of scoring several times. Three minutes before the end of the first half, Jie Hanzhen scored another goal, making the score 2-0.

Military Team Awarded a Penalty Kick

Five minutes into the second half, the military team's midfielder inadvertently let Turner slip through and pass the ball in front of the goal. Jiang Lu rushed to take advantage of the empty space and calmly kicked the ball in. Shortly after, Huo Wei scored again, but it was disallowed due to offsides. The military team's forwards repeatedly attacked the opposing team's camp, but they were unable to penetrate the strong fortress. During one play, Tule sprinted with the ball, and when Bao Jinhan saw the situation was unfavorable, he pushed him hard, resulting in a penalty kick. The military team finally broke their goose egg, and Shabosi followed up to make the score 3-1.

Jiang Lu Scores Two More Goals

The military team continued to pressure, and military players were frequently seen in front of the Tianjin team's goal. The Tianjin team's defenders worked together to maintain an impenetrable defense. However, the military team's defense was lax, and when the visiting team occasionally broke through, they were caught off guard. The goalkeeper's clumsiness was particularly disappointing. Jiang Lu once made a long pass that hit the corner of the goal, revealing the goalkeeper's weakness. After that, although the military team's attacks were more intense than the Tianjin team's, they ultimately had no opportunities to shoot. At 35 minutes, Jiang Lu received a pass from Huo Wei and scored again, making the final score 5-1. The lineups for both teams were as follows:

### International Volleyball

Chinese United Beats Italy

There were two International Volleyball matches yesterday. The first match, starting at 7:00 PM, was between Europe and Palestine. The competition was fierce, especially in the first set, which went to 16-14 before Palestine finally won. In the second set, Europe's momentum waned, and they suffered consecutive defeats. In the second match, Chinese United played against Italy. The strength of the two sides was vastly different. Chinese United was unstoppable, and Italy had no chance to retaliate. The two sets ended in just five minutes. The results are as follows:

(Hong Kong, 29th) In the Governor's Cup football semi-final held on the 29th, Chinese United faced Western United. Due to the selection of various players for the Eastern Association to stay in the province and not participate, the strength of Chinese United was greatly reduced. In the first half, the opposing team's attack was extremely fierce, and Chinese United struggled to maintain a clean sheet for thirty minutes before finally conceding a goal. In the second half, both sides had their share of attacks and defenses. After twenty-two minutes, Liang Baiwei of Chinese United committed a foul and conceded another free kick, resulting in a 0-2 defeat.

### A General Overview of Education in Northeast and Eastern Hebei Under Japanese Cultural Aggression

Controlling Education in the Northeast to Eliminate Revolutionary Thought; Private Schools Increase in Eastern Hebei, Puppet Government to Implement Suppression

In recent years, Japan's cultural aggression against China has become even more aggressive. The most convenient regions for implementation are Northeast China and Eastern Hebei. A summary of the anesthesia education situation in each region is provided below:

(Harbin Correspondence) The Education Department of the puppet Binjiang Provincial Government, in accordance with the principles of Japanese puppet control of education, has unified the secondary and higher education schools in the puppet province and placed them under the direct management of the province to facilitate the implementation of Japanese puppet slave education. All 39 schools have now been taken over. Other training institutes and Sino-Russian and Japanese schools are not included. The puppet education department is currently very busy. In addition, the puppet Ministry of Education has ordered that after all county secondary and higher education schools are transferred to provincial management, the original budget will be used specifically for primary education to consolidate the foundation of Japanese puppet anesthesia education. (Fushun Correspondence) The Fushun puppet county government, following the puppet Ministry of Education's order, held a Japanese puppet art exhibition to commemorate the visit to Japan, with the aim of increasing Japanese puppet friendship. Japanese puppet celebrities stationed in the Northeast, regardless of whether they specialize in Eastern painting, Western painting, or sculpture, are widely solicited to review and display their works to promote the inseparable relationship between Japanese puppet culture. (Another report) The Confucius Society, run by pro-Japanese traitors in the county, is now actively promoting the study of classics, thoroughly publicizing the Japanese puppet royal road doctrine. It has established a classics research class, backed by the Japanese, forcing young male and female students over the age of 18 in schools to enroll.

(Yushu Correspondence) The puppet county magistrate of Yushu County, Xiong Xiyao, in order to secure his position, is shamelessly pandering to Japan. In particular, he has been working hard to promote slave education. He has now purchased a large number of various types of anesthesia primary school textbooks to donate to students in various primary schools, and even private schools receive them. The puppet county magistrate specifically ordered each puppet school principal to distribute the books according to the students' levels, and also ordered each puppet administration director to thoroughly replace the miscellaneous books used in private schools, which inevitably contain revolutionary ideas, with the Japanese puppet state designated textbooks to implement the educational spirit of Japanese puppet friendship, ordering the puppet administration directors to instruct their subordinate puppet township heads to refer to and strictly comply with the book distribution method, and to be supervised by the puppet administration directors to ensure universal distribution.

(Tangshan Correspondence) Tangshan is an important town in eastern Hebei, densely populated, with a population of over 100,000. The number of children who should receive primary education is no less than 10,000, but there are only about a dozen primary schools, including the Kailuan four schools, Pei Ren Shude Er attached primary school, Fengrun County No. 1 and No. 2 primary school, National No. 1 and No. 2 primary school, and Tongren primary school, and Rotary primary school. In addition, several short-term primary schools were established last year by the public education center. The total number of enrolled children is less than 5,000, and more than half of the children are out of school. Due to objective environmental needs, many people take the opportunity to open private schools or tutoring schools. According to a survey by the puppet police bureau, there were a total of over 60 private schools last autumn, with about 1,000 children attending private schools. Since the beginning of this spring, private schools and tutoring schools have emerged in response to the situation. According to a survey by the puppet authorities, 36 new private schools have been established, bringing the total to over 100, many of which inevitably promote revolutionary ideas against the puppet government under the guise of running a school, and suppression is now being planned.

### Japanese Medical Doctor Yoshie Arrested for Forging Certificates to Deceive Our Chinese Students

University Graduation Certificates Cost a Hundred Yuan; Tokyo's Major Newspapers Consider It Unusual

The major newspapers in Tokyo, Japan, published strange news with large headlines in their morning and evening editions of March 20th and the March 21st Japanese publication, namely, that Dr. Yoshie, a professor at the Japanese Medical University, was arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for the buying and selling of graduation certificates between him and a Chinese student surnamed Yang. Prior to the discovery of this incident, Yang was suspected of shoplifting in a bookstore and was reported to the police. At that time, Yang's Japanese Medical University graduation certificate and a research certificate from a certain doctor in the Department of Otolaryngology of the University Hospital were discovered. However, Yang had only arrived in Japan in November of last year, and his command of the language was still poor. How could he have such a certificate? Due to strong suspicions, he was interrogated closely, and it was discovered that the false graduation certificate was made by Dr. Yoshie Yoshiwo, a professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at the Japanese Medical University and the head of the otolaryngology department of the affiliated hospital. The intermediary was a Japanese man named Furubayashi Kenshu, who resided in the Hongo District and made a living by fortune telling. First, Yang gave Furubayashi 100 yuan, and Furubayashi gave Yoshie 20 yuan. Later, Yang visited Yoshie from time to time and gave him another 100 yuan to obtain the aforementioned false graduation certificate. The police department has now arrested both Furubayashi and Yoshie on bribery charges and is conducting a detailed investigation. The case may be transferred to the court. This reporter believes that this incident will have a significant impact on the future of our students studying abroad, and I went to the police department to inquire about the news. According to sources, the police department discovered that many Chinese students studying in Japan had forged and used false domestic graduation certificates in the country in April of the previous year. At that time, as many as 30 people were reported. Later, our Supervisory Office realized that students' violations of the law abroad were detrimental to the national image and specifically joined forces with various schools to strictly crack down on them. The police department did not want the situation to worsen and stepped up its investigation. Most unscrupulous students did not dare to try again. However, the previous false certificates were generally qualifications from our domestic schools. This time, a false graduation certificate from the Japanese Medical University was unexpectedly discovered. It is truly an unfortunate incident for the Japanese academic community that a doctor from the highest institution of learning, who possesses assets of 100,000 yuan, would commit such an illegal act. They very much hope that the country's reputation and the credibility of its academic community will be strengthened through further efforts to investigate and eradicate such imprudent behavior.

### Memorial Service for Huanghuagang Martyrs Held Yesterday by All Circles

Chairman Xing Wan Reports on the Significance of the Commemoration. The Entire City Flies Flags at Half-Mast and Takes a Holiday for Mourning.

Yesterday was the anniversary of the Huanghuagang Revolution Martyrs. The city's Kuomintang headquarters specifically announced in advance the convocation of representatives from all sectors to hold a memorial service at 10:00 AM in the lecture hall of the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road. A white cloth banner was hung in front of the main entrance, reading "Memorial Service for Revolutionary Martyrs Held by Representatives from All Sectors of Shanghai." A similar white cloth banner was hung in front of the lecture hall. In the center of the venue hung the Party and national flags and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Orderly slogans were posted on both sides, and the walls were covered with slogans, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. In addition to Xing Wan from the city Kuomintang headquarters, attendees included Jiang Huaishu from the Defense Committee, Sheng Yizhang from the Foreign Affairs Office, Zhu Cailiang from the Police Bureau, Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Wang Jiashu from the Labor Association, Huang Xianggu from the French Concession Taxpayers' Association, Zhang Yichen from the First Special District Citizens' Association, Mao Yun from the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Lin Kecong from the Women's Association, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, Huang Kegui from the Education Association, Li Tingqiu from the Local Court, Ying Jianfu from the Southern District Citizens' Association, Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union, Hu Tianseng from the New Movement Association, Luo Qinghua from the Silk Industry Association, and representatives from Datong University, Wuben, Xinmin, Ai Qun, Minli Girls' High School, He'an, Weida, Yangjing, Shihua, Tangwan, Dagong, and other primary schools, as well as representatives from various agencies and organizations, totaling over 300 people. The Police Bureau band participated by playing music.

Chairman's Report, Salutations and Other Ceremonies.

Chairman Xing Wan then reported on the significance of the commemoration, stating: "Today is the anniversary of the revolutionary martyrs, the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang twenty-six years ago. The revolutionary spirit of the martyrs is still deeply imprinted in our minds. If it were not for the struggles and sacrifices of the revolutionary martyrs in those years, the autocratic Qing regime would not have been overthrown so quickly, and the Republic of China would not have been established so quickly. If the Republic of China had not been established, our nation would not be striding so vigorously onto the glorious path of rejuvenation as it is today. Therefore, it is especially meaningful to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs today, when the entire country is unified and advancing in construction, cultural development is surging forward, and national spirit is soaring. First, the Guangzhou uprising on the twenty-ninth day of the third month of the Xinhai year occurred after Sun Yat-sen's ninth revolutionary failure. At that time, the revolutionaries were demoralized by the recent failure, and the Qing court's defenses were particularly strict. In such a harsh environment, the revolutionary martyrs disregarded everything and made a final struggle. More than two hundred people participated in this uprising. Although it still failed, most of the comrades were able to face death with courage and determination, preferring death to surrender. They never showed the slightest sign of submission or compromise. The martyrs numbered seventy-two, but there were actually dozens more whose names are unknown. This kind of courageous and fearless spirit is truly enough to move heaven and earth and make the gods weep. We, who are facing a formidable enemy today, should emulate them. Second, although this revolution failed, it pushed the revolutionary process forward a great deal, planting a very effective seed for the Wuchang Uprising. Sun Yat-sen once said, 'Gathering the elite of revolutionary parties from all provinces to make a final stand against the Manchus, even if the cause does not succeed, the heroic actions of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang have shaken the world, and the revolutionary situation in the country has been created by this.' Because the strike by the revolutionary martyrs awakened the hearts of the people throughout the country, increased the courage of the party members, and shifted the attention of the great powers, the easy success of the Xinhai Revolution was not without its roots in this. From this perspective, although the revolutionary martyrs shed blood and sacrificed themselves, this bloodshed and sacrifice was the price for the later success of the revolution. The founding history of the Republic of China was dyed with their red blood. Now that we understand the significance of commemorating the revolutionary martyrs, we should also have three points of understanding: ㊀ Why did the revolutionary martyrs have such a courageous and fearless spirit? Undoubtedly, it was because they had an accurate understanding and deep faith in the Three Principles of the People, and that the Republic of China should be built on the Three Principles of the People. Without the Three Principles of the People, there would be no Republic of China. Whether in space or time, there should absolutely not be two ideologies existing. We are willing to unite in spirit with those who believe in the Three Principles of the People and strive for the Three Principles of the People to resist foreign aggression. Otherwise, they are traitors to the Republic of China, and therefore traitors to the revolutionary martyrs. ㊁ The Republic of China is whole and indivisible. If anyone insists on creating disturbances and breaking the Republic of China, which the revolutionary martyrs exchanged for with their blood and sacrifice, whether they are foreign invaders or internal traitors, and regardless of what name or slogan they use, they will undermine the future of the Republic of China. It is important to know that whether the Chinese nation achieves liberation depends on strength as a prerequisite. The so-called strength naturally includes military power, financial power, and popular support. Every time there is a civil war, the national strength is weakened once. Weakening national strength is tantamount to suicide, which is tantamount to helping the enemy. Now China has completed a genuine peaceful unification. We can only guarantee this internal peaceful unification forever to be worthy of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution. ㊂ The Three Principles of the People is centered on people's livelihood. Only by completing the economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood can the goal of the revolution be achieved. The reason why the revolutionary martyrs were unyielding and willing to sacrifice their lives was not just to overthrow the Manchu Qing government, but to go one step further and ensure that the 400 million people could all have their needs for clothing, housing, and transportation met. Therefore, on the one hand, we must ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty, and on the other hand, we must enable the entire Chinese nation to share common welfare economically. Therefore, creating national capital and protecting private capital are the most important tasks at this stage. Even from the perspective of resisting foreign aggression, our independent economic construction is indispensable and cannot be delayed. Finally, I hope that from now on, everyone will continue the fighting spirit of the revolutionary martyrs and exchange the price of blood and flesh for the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation."

### Former Italian Finance Minister Stefani Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon

Scheduled to Visit Chiang Kai-shek in Hangzhou This Afternoon to Pay Respects. Will be Permanently Stationed in Nanjing for Office Work.

Former Italian Minister of Finance, Mr. Stefani, who has been hired as a consultant to the Chinese government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th) at 1:30 PM aboard the Italian ship Victoria, accompanied by his wife, one son, two daughters, and secretary Magner, totaling six people. The ship docked at the China Merchants Bureau's north pier. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent Jiang Baili to welcome him. Mr. Stefani is scheduled to take the express train to Hangzhou at 1:40 PM this afternoon (30th) to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The details are as follows:

Arrival Situation

The Victoria was originally scheduled to arrive at 2:30 PM yesterday, but arrived an hour early due to favorable winds.

Mr. Xue Guangqian then accompanied him to visit the construction of the city center and paid tribute to the Songhu war zone. He greatly praised China's various new constructions. The Italian Consul-General Nilon held a welcome banquet for him at 278 Hongqiao Road at 8:00 PM last night to welcome him. Chiang Baili and Xue Guangqian were invited to accompany him.

Departing for Hangzhou This Morning

Jiang Baili and Xue Guangqian will accompany him. He is expected to stay in Hangzhou for one or two days and then return to Shanghai to take office in Nanjing.

According to Mr. Stefani's remarks to the Central News Agency reporter on the ship upon arriving in Shanghai, "I am sixty years old and have never been to China. I am very happy to be invited to China this time. My term of office here is four months, and I will set up an office in Nanjing, so I will be permanently stationed in the capital in the future. I will not stay in Shanghai for long and will go to Hangzhou to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Before I have met with Mr. Chiang, I am not comfortable making many remarks. Whether I will go to Southern and Northern China for inspection in the future must also wait until after I have met with Mr. Chiang." Mr. Stefani is a well-known financial expert, and his invitation to China will make a considerable contribution to China's financial administration.

### Chen Shaokuan Flies to Shanghai Yesterday Morning

### Diao Zuojian Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon

Discusses the Recent Decrease in Smuggling in South China. Will Go to Nanjing Soon to Visit Foreign Minister Wang to Report on His Duties.

Diao Zuojian, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th) at 1:30 PM aboard the Italian shipping company's ship Victoria from Hong Kong and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. A Central News Agency reporter paid him a visit. According to him, he was dispatched to Guangdong last August and has been in office for seven months, so he is going north to Nanjing to visit Foreign Minister Wang to report on his duties. Since the political situation in Guangdong and Guangxi has been stabilized, everything has been on the right track, and the abolition of miscellaneous taxes has been especially pleasing to the people of the two provinces. The people of Guangdong deeply mourn the death of Huang Musong, the former chairman of the provincial government, and consider it a major loss for the people of Baiyue. Since Huang took office, he has actively reorganized the administration and sought welfare for the people. As for smuggling in South China, it has recently decreased. The reason is that the customs crackdown is strict and the dishonest merchants who collude with smugglers are severely punished. It is also due to the unified spirit of solidarity of the people of Guangdong. Since smuggling extended to South China, the legitimate Chinese merchants, considering that it is difficult to distinguish whether Japanese goods are smuggled, are wary of buying Japanese goods, which has affected the business of legitimate Japanese merchants. As a result, Japanese merchants have voluntarily asked their government to ban smugglers from smuggling in South China and to send the smugglers in Guangdong back to their country, which shows that legitimate Japanese merchants also hate the smuggling of Japanese gangsters.

### Lin Kanghou to be Employer Representative at International Labor Conference

Various Organizations Recommended Yesterday. Tian He** and Xie Jia as Advisors.

Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, Wang Qiyu, Wu YunChu, Qian Chengxu, Cai Shengbai, Cheng Haifeng, director of the China branch of the National Labor Bureau, and Wu Kaitian, dispatched by the Ministry of Treasures, attended the meeting. Guo Shun chaired the meeting. After discussion, it was decided to recommend Lin Kanghou as the employer representative to the 23rd International Labor Conference, Tian He** as an advisor, and Xie Jia as an advisor and secretary. The two associations will jointly submit a report to the Ministry of Industry for review and appointment.

### Spain Voluntarily Abandons Consular Jurisdiction

Civil and Criminal Cases Involving Spanish Nationals Should Be Handled by Our Country in Accordance with the Law.

According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance issued an order to the relevant agencies stating: "The Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 1417 of March 16th of this year states: 'The Judicial Yuan's Consultation No. 29 of March 8th of this year states: "After the coup in Spain, the Spanish envoys and consuls stationed in our country have successively left their posts. In fact, the consular jurisdiction has been voluntarily abandoned. Since there is no legitimate agency to handle cases involving Spanish nationals, for the sake of protecting public safety and legal interests, the competent judicial agencies should uniformly accept cases involving Spanish nationals in China for adjudication in accordance with the law in order to provide relief." The Ministry, in accordance with its responsibilities, has already consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and issued orders to all courts to comply. In the future, when accepting civil and criminal cases involving Spanish nationals, they must be handled expeditiously in accordance with the law and reported to the Ministry for record. In addition to informing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Supreme Court, please review, present to the Executive Yuan for record, and inform the relevant agencies accordingly." Therefore, in addition to submitting a report to the National Government for record, we hereby consult your Yuan for review and inform the relevant agencies accordingly. This order, etc.' In addition to distributing the order, we hereby order you to acknowledge it and inform the relevant agencies accordingly. This order."

### Appointment of Wu Nanru as Minister to Denmark, Returned to China Yesterday Afternoon and Arrived in Shanghai

Mr. Wu Nanru, the former Counselor and Chargé d'Affaires of our Embassy in the Soviet Union, newly appointed Minister to Denmark, returned to China on leave. He departed from Italy by the Victoria liner at the beginning of the month and arrived at 1:30 PM yesterday. Dozens of Wu's relatives and friends went to the China Merchants North Wharf to welcome him. After disembarking, Mr. Wu immediately returned to his residence to rest. He will stay in Shanghai for about two or three days before going to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his work in the Soviet Union and Denmark. Then, he will return to his native Yixing to bury his late father. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wu on the ship yesterday. Mr. Wu gave the following account: "I have been granted leave by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to return to China for about three months. After the leave, I will return to Denmark to resume my post. As for this return to China, firstly, because I served in the Embassy in the Soviet Union for four years before going to Denmark, I should report to the government on the work situation during these four years. Secondly, in the past four or five years, domestic construction has progressed rapidly, and foreign opinions often praise it. As diplomatic officials, we should be familiar with the situation in our country so that we can deal with foreign affairs more appropriately. Thirdly, my father passed away in December last year. I was unable to return home at that time. Now I plan to take advantage of this vacation to arrange the funeral and handle other private matters." When the reporter asked about Sino-Soviet relations, Mr. Wu seemed unwilling to express any opinion. However, he smiled and said, "Our country is willing to maintain friendship with any country that treats us equally and does not harbor aggressive ambitions." Regarding the situation in Denmark, Mr. Wu said, "Our country's foreign trade has always been a deficit, but with Denmark, we have had a surplus for many years. Three years ago, the value of our annual surplus of goods was more than 20 million national currency, but it has shrunk in recent years. How to seek continued development in the future is a problem worthy of attention." Regarding the general trend in Europe, Mr. Wu said, "There will be no breakdown in one or two years. However, since the failure of the disarmament conference and the frustration of collective security, European countries are now competing to increase military preparations. The United Kingdom has also recently passed a budget to increase military preparations by 1.5 billion pounds in five years. All countries have completely restored the armed peace of before 1914. However, the so-called armed peace can only postpone the war, but it cannot eliminate it. Moreover, after the postponement, the outbreak of war will be even more brutal."

### Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Other Rice Merchants Go to Beijing

Requesting a Ban on the Import of Foreign Rice into Guangdong

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, grain merchants from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces and cities, after learning that the central government had approved the tax-free import of foreign rice into Guangdong, all believed that this move would affect the rural economy. In addition to Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Grain Industry Association, visiting the newly appointed Governor of Guangdong Province, Wu Tiecheng, in Shanghai a few days ago to present a petition, explaining the advantages and disadvantages and requesting a suspension, representatives of local grain organizations specifically scheduled to gather in Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 30th to petition the Central Political Committee, the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and other agencies to stop it. The representatives have successively gone to Beijing. Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Grain Industry Association, Zhu Zixiang of the Bean and Rice Association, Chen Shide, Cao Zhixin, representative of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Rice Industry Joint Association, and others took the Shanghai-Ping Train at 4:00 PM yesterday and are scheduled to arrive in Beijing this morning to jointly petition with representatives from various provinces and cities. They are expected to stay for one to three days and then return to Shanghai. The petition is recorded as follows: "The taxation of imported foreign rice began in the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932]. However, Guangdong Province did not unify the tax rate until last year. Considering the lack of grain, it made a request for tax exemption. The central government has accommodated its request and approved the import of one million dan of half-tax recorded foreign rice. However, recent news has spread that another one million dan each of tax-free foreign rice and foreign grains will be imported into Guangdong to alleviate the shortage during the transition period. If this becomes a reality, it will gradually lead to the encroachment of foreign rice, and it will add to the burden of the central government's relief to rural areas. To speak of its disadvantages, it is actually no different from worrying about immediate problems and forgetting about internal organs. Therefore, we venture to present our humble opinions to Your Excellency for consideration. According to the foreign rice tax, it is stipulated in the current customs tariff. Customs duties should adopt a unified system within the same territory. This is something that no one disagrees with. At the beginning of the taxation of foreign rice in our country, Guangdong and Fujian provinces held different views. There were other political reasons, not entirely related to the people's food. After the unification of political orders in Fujian Province, this tax was also levied as a clear proof. During Chen Jitang's administration in Guangdong Province, a large amount of foreign rice was allowed to be imported, resulting in a very large trade deficit in international trade. Fortunately, the political orders have also been unified in the past few years, so the unified collection of this tax should not be disregarded again. This is one reason why the foreign rice tax should not be exempted in terms of the integrity of customs duties. Domestic trade is valued for its ability to exchange goods and adjust the national economy to move towards prosperity. Last year, when Guangdong Province requested exemption from the foreign rice tax, the Executive Yuan ordered the Hunan Provincial Government to quickly plan for the relief and convenience of selling Hunan rice to Guangdong and ordered the Railway Department to quickly set a special price for Hunan rice transported to Guangdong, so that the economies and food of the two provinces could be mutually adjusted. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance also confirmed that the foreign rice tax was established to protect domestic agricultural products and that the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui had bumper harvests last year and had surplus grain to supply the needs of Guangdong Province. The food shortage in Guangdong Province should be purchased from domestic rice as much as possible for relief. True knowledge and insight have been deeply stated. Although Guangdong Province is a grain-deficient area, it is better to obtain resources from the interior than to rely on foreign rice. In recent years, the rural economy has been on the verge of bankruptcy. Fortunately, there were bumper harvests in various places last year, and there are signs of gradual recovery. If Guangdong Province still allows tax-free foreign rice to encroach and sell, farmers in the interior will be in a desperate situation due to the obstruction of rice sales. This is the second reason why the foreign rice tax should not be exempted in terms of the national economy. As for Guangdong Province, although the central government has allowed one million dan of half-tax recorded foreign rice to be imported and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has added special trains to transport Hunan rice, and the Grain Transportation Bureau has specially hired ships to transport Anhui rice, according to the investigation report of the Transportation Department, the so-called rice shortage panic has become a thing of the past. Even recently, each producing area has transported a surplus of grain to Guangdong, such as more than 100,000 shi of rice specially transported from Shanghai, and the surplus grain transported from Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces is even more numerous, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the transition period with surplus. In addition, the climate in Lingnan is warm, and rice matures early, and the harvest period is not far away. Therefore, there is absolutely no shortage of rice in the future. This is the third reason why the foreign rice tax does not need to be exempted in terms of Guangdong Province's people's food. In summary, it is undoubtedly clear that it is not appropriate to change the Guangdong Province's tax collection. We hope that Your Excellency will investigate and strictly prevent the internal tax on foreign rice, so as to maintain the integrity of customs duties and promote the national economy. We are extremely fortunate. Respectfully presented by the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry, Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, Shanghai Grain Store Industry Association, and the United Association of Rice Industry Associations of Ningbo and Shanghai Municipalities and Counties."

### Silk Weaving Industry Labor Dispute to be Mediated Today

Yesterday was a Statutory Memorial Day, and Workers Stopped Work Uniformly

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a mediation for the silk weaving factory workers' demands for improved treatment conditions at 9:00 AM today. Yesterday was the Memorial Day of the Huanghuagang Martyrs. According to the central government's regulations, all factories were closed for one day with wages paid as usual. However, silk weaving factory workers have never taken holidays. Since the mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, which stipulated that statutory memorial days should be handled in accordance with the Factory Law, the industrial unions of the silk weaving industry in various districts notified the workers of each factory the night before that they should take a day off with wages paid as usual. Therefore, the workers of various factories belonging to Mei Ya and Hengfeng in the Pudong district and Baohua in the Puxi district all stopped working yesterday.

Disturbances Occurred

Yesterday morning, silk weaving factories such as Shengdan in Nanshi, Puxi, Pudong, and Zhabei districts continued to operate as usual. However, the workers did not enter the factory to work. The industrial unions of the colored weaving industry in various districts organized pickets to explain to the workers that statutory memorial days should be taken off with wages paid as usual. Because some factories did not allow work to stop, disturbances occurred. Fortunately, the local police stations dispatched police to suppress them, and no incidents occurred. It is heard that the workers of each factory said that they would go to work as usual this morning.

Workers' Meeting

The representatives of the workers of each factory held a representative assembly at the Wusa Cemetery in Baziqiao, Zhabei, at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 800 representatives of workers from factories such as Mei Ya, Baohua, Da Mei, and Jiu Hua attended. In addition to reporting on the 30 conditions for improved treatment proposed by the workers mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Party Department, it was also resolved to rescue the arrested workers of the Tenth Mei Ya Factory and to comfort the released and injured workers of the Tenth Mei Ya Factory, requesting the factory to notify the meals provided to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future, etc. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM.

### Ye Chucang Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Visited Kong Xiangxi to Say Goodbye

Mr. Lai Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, left Beijing the day before yesterday (the 28th) and passed through Xixi to Shanghai. After getting off the train at the North Station that night, he returned to his residence to rest. He went out yesterday morning to visit Mr. Kong Xiangxi, who was sent to England to participate in the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor, to say goodbye. Then, he invited Qian Xinzhai, President of Fudan University, Wu Nanxuan, Vice President, and others to discuss school affairs. It is heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funds Management Office has donated a piece of land near Meiyuan in Wuxi to Fudan University. Mr. Ye made a special trip to investigate. The site is located at the foot of the mountain, facing Taihu Lake, and the environment is excellent, which is very suitable for building school buildings. Therefore, he will actively plan the construction. It is also learned that Mr. Ye has already taken the night train back to Beijing last night.

### Establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literary and Art Association (Continued from Yesterday)

Speech by Vice Minister Fang

Next, Fang Zhi, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, delivered a speech, saying, "Today is the day of the establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literary and Art Association. I feel very honored to be able to attend the grand meeting. Especially during the previous meeting of the initiators, I was invited to attend and heard the insightful opinions of many gentlemen in the Shanghai literary and art circles. I know that your association will soon be established, and the organization will definitely be sound. Now, as expected, the inaugural meeting is held today, and so many people have attended, and the charter is so detailed, which shows that the future development of your association will be immeasurable. This is predictable. During this inaugural meeting, I have two points to contribute to you for reference, and I also ask for your guidance. First, we must have a self-disciplined attitude. In the past, whether we ran newspapers or schools, we often took the meaning of others as our own and could not examine and regulate ourselves. Now, we must change the old malpractices. Whether we run newspapers or schools, we must seek improvement and achieve concrete development. As the chairman reported just now, the literary and art circles in the past did not have a concrete organization, and the will could not be unified. Now everyone feels this shortcoming. The literary and art circles should unite and organize themselves to examine themselves and study literary and artistic works, so that culture will improve day by day, and the future of literary and art will be brighter and brighter. The first point is to develop the commonality of the people and correct the personality of the people. It is very important to develop the personality of the people. Literary and artistic works are the only tool for developing the personality of the people. However, in developing personality, do not forget the commonality of the people. I hope that after the establishment of the Chinese Literary and Art Association, writers across the country will develop personality on the one hand and fully express the commonality of the thoughts of young people and the entire Chinese cultural cause in literary and art. What is the commonality of the people? It is to carry out the literary and art renaissance movement on the one hand and the national rejuvenation movement on the other hand. This national rejuvenation movement is the commonality that the people should have at the current stage. I hope that you will unite the national literary and artistic writers and lead the general youth from this commonality, which will surely make a great contribution to the country and the nation. Finally, I wish your association an unlimited future."

Speech by Committee Member Tong

Then, Tong Xingbai, a Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Special City Party Department, delivered a speech, saying, "After the establishment of your association, there should be a common belief in order to have mutual trust. This has already been mentioned in the initiation. I hope that all members of your association will have a deep faith in this central theory. Secondly, I hope that your association will not only bear the responsibility of reviving literary and art but also shoulder the responsibility of national rejuvenation. China had a new trend before the first year of the Republic of China [1912], that is, the rise of nationalistic literary and artistic works led to the rapid success of the national revolution. After that, there was a new cultural movement, which greatly helped the revolution after the 15th year of the Republic of China [1926]. Therefore, the literary and art circles have made a great contribution to the history of the Chinese revolution. At present, the biggest movement in China is the national rejuvenation movement, and the national rejuvenation movement requires efforts in all aspects, and the literary and art renaissance movement is the central movement in the national rejuvenation movement. Therefore, I hope that after the establishment of the Literary and Art Association, there will be a new literary and art movement to promote the national rejuvenation movement."

Today, because time is limited, I will not speak too much, but I will contribute two words. The first word is "open mind." I firmly believe that the members of your association will be fully united and completely eliminate all opinions that may have existed in the past in this association. Open your minds and join hands. The second word is "grasp the era." I hope that the work of your association will clearly recognize the current era and firmly grasp it. We certainly do not want to be behind the times, but we do not want to surpass the times too much. The rush to run makes all literary and artistic works in line with the needs of the country and the nation, and I wish the achievements of your association will be unlimited.

Declaration of the General Assembly

The initiation of this association has several meanings. The most important ones are listed below. We know that the ancients had the so-called "meeting friends with literature." Now the scope of the world is larger, and new knowledge and new ideas are emerging endlessly. However, personal knowledge is limited. Therefore, if we can gather together, we can gather wisdom and benefit each other, which will greatly benefit our learning. This is the first. Moreover, we know that the biggest reason why misunderstandings and barriers occur between friends is the lack of opportunities to gather and talk freely. Therefore, if we can meet often and talk together, then the so-called "writers despise each other, which has been the case since ancient times" may not necessarily be the case today. This is the second. Moreover, today, in order to protect its own interests, any industry has a trade association. Literary and artistic production is no different from commodities, and literary and artistic writers have the same interests and need to act together, such as copyright protection and the introduction of works. Therefore, the organization of the Literary and Art Association is also necessary. This is the third. From a larger perspective, Shanghai is the center of Sino-foreign transportation and the center of China's cultural publishing industry. However, the literary and art circles have always been self-interested and rarely connected. We believe that if we can jointly establish an organization, it will not only provide a mutual communication mechanism for the country, but also enable us to interact with the international community, which will benefit cultural diplomacy. This is the fourth. Fifth, today's China is in a critical situation, like a pile of eggs. Resisting the enemy and defending against insults requires the suffering and sacrifice of the entire people. However, inspiring the national spirit, promoting the national concept, and establishing a strong spiritual national defense are the responsibilities of those of us engaged in literary and art. This also requires us to be able to combine and work together. Therefore, after several discussions, we initiated the organization of the Chinese Literary and Art Association, and the Shanghai Branch was established first. We hope that literary and artistic colleagues in Shanghai will join together to form a large alliance.

### Letter from the Citizens' Association to the Public Works Department Requesting Reconsideration of the Cancellation of the Increase in General Taxes

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday morning, stating: "Dear Sirs, we have learned that your bureau has ignored the facts of social and economic decline and has disregarded the opinions of the five Chinese directors, who represent more than 64% of the tax revenue and more than 95% of the population. It has established a proposal to increase the general tax by 2%, from 14% to 16%, and the land tax by 1/1000, from 7/1000 to 8/1000, and is preparing to submit it to the taxpayers' meeting. The association deeply regrets this. We are sending you a copy of the association's declaration and letter to the citizens of the Shanghai First Special District. Please investigate immediately and reconsider the cancellation of the proposal."

### Chinese Disasters in the Past Fifteen Years

Foreign Discussions Translated from the French Shanghai Daily reported that French Father Chakinot wrote a letter to the French Shanghai Daily, saying, "Regarding the cooperation between China and foreign countries, people used to think that the East is the East, and the West is the West, and there is no possibility of coordination. However, in the past fifteen years, our cooperation in the Sino-Foreign Relief Association has shown that the views of the past are unreliable. The prevalence of natural and man-made disasters is not unique to China. Even the modernization of the United States cannot prevent the overflow of the Mississippi River, and the technicalization of Russia still has the problem of famine from time to time. As for England and France, although the organization of disaster prevention is perfect, there are ways to prevent the frequent occurrence of disasters, but with the large land of China, it is difficult to compare. It is not appropriate for us to compare the Thames River in England and the Seine River in France with the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in China. The disaster of the Yellow River in China has been going on for thousands of years. In the era of Yao and Shun in China, two thousand years before the Christian era, water management had already become a major problem. Today, we are more than two thousand years after the Christian era, and the disaster of the Yellow River is still the same. Since the Yellow River changed its course in 1852, its disaster has become more and more serious. In addition to natural disasters in China, there are also man-made disasters, such as the civil wars, bandits, and communist troops over the years, which have further fueled the abuse. Fortunately, since the establishment of the Nanjing government, these man-made disasters have gradually decreased. Due to the vast land and serious disaster situation in China, it is difficult to succeed without the relief of Sino-foreign cooperation. According to the statistics of various charitable relief agencies, only a small number of disaster victims are receiving relief and waiting to be born. According to the statistics of the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, for every one million people rescued, there must be three million disaster victims who starve to death. And this one million people rescued is not solely the credit of the Relief Association. There are many disaster relief agencies in China, and the Relief Association is only one of them. In the past fifteen years, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association has received donations from all parties totaling 9 million yuan, and the income of other charitable organizations is probably even more than that. Regarding the use of relief funds, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association has spent 55% on direct relief, and another 45% on work relief. According to Father Chakinot, the work relief projects undertaken by the Sino-Foreign Relief Association are all public welfare undertakings, such as the dredging of the Huai River and the planting of forests in Gansu and Shaanxi. After the public utilities are increased, they directly seek to relieve the disaster victims, so that they do not develop a habit of eating idly. Indirectly, they are also sufficient to engage in the important work of preventing disasters. According to the statistics of Catholic Father Chakinot, the disaster relief work of the Sino-Foreign Relief Association actually began in 1920-21. At the beginning, it paid much attention to publicity work. In the first year, it received donations of 2,436,561 yuan and 41 cents as a fund. In 1922, it received donations of 2,003,497 yuan and was responsible for disaster relief work in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, with work relief as the mainstay. In 1923, it received 1,059,480 yuan, which was used exclusively for road construction and dike construction in Anhui, with a total road length of 1,061 li and a dike length of 937 li. In 1924-25, it received donations of 355,955 yuan to relieve the drought in Zhejiang, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, with Guizhou being the worst. In 1926, it received 34,971 yuan in relief funds to be used for work relief in Jiangsu. In 1927-28, it carried out work relief specifically in Shandong, Henan, and Guangdong provinces, spending only 124,996 yuan in relief funds. In 1929, it used 360,246 yuan to relieve the disaster victims in Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Tongdong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces. The work relief method was to assist the government in carrying out the Huai River diversion project, which was beneficial to farming. In 1930, the work relief in Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces cost 120,830 yuan. At that time, more than 100,000 disaster victims in Henan were sent to Lanzhou. In 1931, due to the flood of the Yangtze River, more funds were used, costing 1,449,069 yuan, and dikes were repaired in Gaoyou and other places. In 1932, it received donations of 390,752 yuan, which were mostly used for the canal project in northern Jiangsu, and the dike in Gaoyou was also continued, employing 50,000 workers at a cost of 400,000 yuan. When the engineers of the League of Nations came to visit, they also exclaimed it as a masterpiece. In 1933, it received donations of 42,462 yuan, which were mostly used for relief work in Shaanxi and Jiangxi. In 1934, it received donations of 99,856 yuan. In 1935, it received donations of 383,290 yuan. In 1936, it received donations of 250,000 yuan. The work relief in these three years has spread to various cities, especially the provinces in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins.

### Establishment of the Sichuan Drought Relief Association

Third Delegation of Representatives to Petition the Capital Regularly: Requesting the Issuance of 10 Million Yuan in Public Bonds for Relief

The drought in Sichuan has been intensifying since last autumn. Now, not only are beans and wheat failing, but rice is also difficult to plant. Even drinking water is scarce. Hundreds of thousands of people are starving, and the tragic situation is unbearable to hear. The Sichuan Provincial Association here previously sent Li Qingfan, Lü Yifeng, Mei Xinru, and others to Beijing to contact the Sichuan Provincial Association in Beijing and make a second petition to the central government for relief. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 28th). According to them, the central government has already allocated 200,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. However, with the disaster area spanning more than 120 counties and the number of starving people reaching over 3 million, this is just a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Therefore, the association convened an emergency meeting yesterday (the 29th) and established the Drought Relief Association. Xie Chi, Yang Shukan, Xiong Kewu, Huang Fusheng, Xu Keting, Lü Yifeng, Tang Jinfan, Li Xunfu, Li Qingfan, Mei Xinru, Pu Fengma, Yang Jifu, Zheng Yushu, Ren Wangnan, Zhang Shulin, Fan Zhongqu, Tang Dean, Yu Yunlan, Li Boshen, Gu Juliu, Lei Yu, Chun and others were elected as members. They will contact the Sichuan Provincial Association in Beijing to solicit donations and petition the government to issue 10 million yuan in Sichuan disaster relief public bonds for fundamental relief. At the same time, Li Qingfan, Lü Yifeng, and Mei Xinru will be sent to Beijing for the third time on April 1 to petition.

### YWCA Opens Second Dormitory

The Shanghai YWCA has had a dormitory for more than 20 years. Not only are the internal facilities suitable for women, but the prices of meals and accommodation are also affordable for women. The YWCA also pays close attention to the personality and academic performance of the boarders. Therefore, the dormitory is not only the safest place for women from all over the country to stay when passing through Shanghai, but also an indispensable place for professional women in Shanghai to stay. As a result, it enjoys a high reputation, and there are many applicants. The dormitory at 323 Moore Road is not enough to meet the demand, so a second dormitory has been opened at 638 Weihaiwei Road. It is currently under construction and is expected to open at the end of this month. Anyone who wants to stay can go directly to 638 Weihaiwei Road (telephone: 37633) to contact the dormitory department and obtain a copy of the regulations.

### Shu Shunfu Sentenced for Fraudulently Obtaining Money

Sentenced to Two Years in Prison

Shu Shunfu, a Ningbo native from Tonghe Catering Company at 217 Wuchang Road, had been a clerk in the company for many years and was trusted by the manager, Wu Huanan, a Cantonese. Recently, he suddenly had a strange idea and was blinded by greed. Between January 6 and February 1 of this year, he took the opportunity to steal three blank checks from the company, stamped them, and had his friend Chen Axiang, who is still at large, fill in the amount. He withdrew a total of 923 yuan in three installments from the Yong'an Hongkou Branch on North Sichuan Road and then secretly returned to his home at 47 Yangmiaoqian, Zhenhainanmen, Ningbo, to hide. After the incident, the Hongkou Police Station was reported, and Chinese detective Fang Fucheng was sent with a letter from the First Special District Court to arrest him at his address together with the local police station. Only 5 yuan in banknotes, a gold ring, and silver coins worth a total of 28 yuan were found on his person. He was taken to Shanghai and sent to the Third Criminal Court. It was found that he had used more than 400 yuan of the money he had taken to buy groceries and utensils, and he had deposited 500 yuan in the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank in Xiaodongmen, Shanghai. The deposit book was hidden in a clothes box at his home in Ningbo, but the money was withdrawn by his family during the change of address. Regarding the civil suit attached to the company, the defendant's relative, surnamed Wu, mediated with manager Wu Huanan and compensated 300 yuan, and there were also wooden utensils worth more than 200 yuan, which he was willing to auction off to return the money. The defendant was sent back to the hall to await sentencing. The stolen goods and the money obtained from the sale of stolen goods would be returned to the original owner. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Bianfen presided over the court and sentenced Shu Shunfu to two years in prison and a fine of 500 yuan. If he was to perform labor service, it would be calculated at 3 yuan per day.

### Lu Wensheng Prosecuted for Dismantling and Selling Radios

She stated that she married her husband at the age of 17. However, six or seven years ago, the defendant became involved with bad people, behaved improperly, and developed addictions. Since then, he has been neglecting his duties and living off his savings. Every time she tried to persuade him, he would not listen and even beat and scold her. Unable to bear it, she went out to work as a helper. The defendant still did not improve and come to his senses, and came to blackmail her. Therefore, she requested a divorce so that she could have a way out. The court ordered the defendant to appear, but mediation failed. He was ordered to file a formal lawsuit.

### Association for Participation in the Paris Exposition to Convene General Meeting Tomorrow Morning

Ambassador Gu Cables Progress of Negotiations with France

Regarding China's participation in the Paris International Exposition, the association has been soliciting entries from all parties, and many have been sent from various places. The Jicha entry selection branch has also collected more than a thousand excellent entries, which are scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai on the 5th of next month. As for the participation method, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador Gu stationed in France to negotiate with the French government, and there have been results, which have also been reported by cable. The association is scheduled to convene a general meeting tomorrow (the 31st) morning to discuss the progress. The details are as follows:

Jicha Entries Scheduled to Be Shipped to Shanghai

The China Association for Participation in the Paris International Exposition was initiated by members of the Central Committee, such as Shi Ceng and Chu Minyi. It was jointly established by four organizations: the China Association for World Cultural Cooperation, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and the Shanghai Bankers' Association. A selection committee was established, and leaders from the educational, cultural, industrial, and commercial circles of Shanghai were hired to be responsible for collecting entries. People from all parties responded enthusiastically and participated. The Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee has established a selection branch to assist in the progress and has collected more than a thousand excellent entries, which are packed in about 30 boxes. They will be shipped to Shanghai on April 5 and cabled: "Letter 105 received with respect. If it is necessary to review them, please send personnel to Beijing to handle them to avoid the cumbersome opening procedures and the fear of wasting time and delaying matters. How we hope to reply in order to welcome them." After receiving the telegram from the Ji-Cha entry selection branch in Beijing, whether or not to send personnel to review them is still under discussion. The entries collected in Shanghai have not yet been decided even after the selection committee has reviewed them twice. The preparation of catalogs and explanations is being actively carried out. Therefore, after discussion by the presidium, Li Shizeng, Chu Minyi, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, and Lin Kanghou, it was decided to hold a general meeting at 10 a.m. on the 31st in the auditorium of the World Academy on Fooking Road to discuss the progress. The notice has been issued yesterday.

Ambassador Gu Cables the Results of the Negotiations

After the association was established, it was approved by the Executive Yuan for record and issued 50,000 yuan in funding to assist it. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was ordered to notify French Ambassador Nazia to inform the French government and to instruct Ambassador Gu Weijun stationed in France to negotiate with the French government. Ambassador Gu has now cabled the results of the negotiations as follows: "Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing, regarding the participation in the Exposition, I have been negotiating with the authorities here for the past two months, going through four or five agencies and consulting back and forth more than ten times. I have now received a definite reply that they will make a special arrangement to allocate one or two rooms in the International East Hall for our exhibition, completely free of charge, on the condition that we state that this participation is sponsored by our government. The construction of this exhibition hall is specifically for the use of officially participating countries. I believe that the purpose of this Exposition is to express the ideas and feelings of all nations and is truly a grand international movement to promote modern civilization and material progress. The world is watching, so many countries are enthusiastically participating. There are now nearly 50 countries. I have heard that our eastern neighbor has a huge construction plan and that the exhibits they have prepared are particularly exquisite. They also plan to advertise for the puppet state. The French government also intends to use this Exposition to stabilize finance and recover the economy, so they attach great importance to it and are extremely generous to the representatives, overseas Chinese, and tourists from officially participating countries to show their encouragement. They are surprised and show contempt for our non-participation. I am afraid that after the opening, people from various countries will have more misunderstandings. Fortunately, the domestic organization has established an association to find ways to participate unofficially, which will help to remedy the situation. However, the exhibits must also be carefully selected and carefully selected with reference to the standard programs issued by the Exposition. We must also compile systematic charts, images, and photos to represent the new spirit, new construction, new education, and new life of the entire country and nation, and use this to promote and change the general Western perception of us. I hope the government will fully assist the association with funding so that it can make appropriate arrangements and displays to achieve good results. I also hope that the Ministries of Education and Industry will select two specialists to come to France to carefully examine and study the overall situation and report back to the country for reference, which will be of great benefit to the future of our industry, education, literature, technology, and art. I respectfully request that the above points be forwarded to the relevant ministries and the association. Now, the location has been determined. I urgently request that the government inform me of its intentions regarding the so-called conditions so that I can formally notify the French government in accordance with the previous order."

### New Hong Kong Government Regulations for Entry of Travelers

### The French Concession Employment Agency is Unable to Increase Donations

The Chinese Taxpayers Association Sends Another Letter to the Board of Directors Requesting a Reduction in Donations

Guomin News Agency says that the French Concession Board of Directors has decided to increase the donations of employment agencies by twelve times. The industry is unable to bear it and has requested the Chinese Taxpayers Association to send a letter to the French Concession Board of Directors requesting a reduction. The association then received a reply that they were unable to make concessions. The association believes that the industry is indeed unable to bear it in reality, so it sent another letter to the French Concession Board of Directors yesterday requesting approval for a reduction in donations. The original letter stated: "In response to your letter of the 25th of this month, the Board of Directors has resolved to increase the donations of employment agencies. The amount of the donation is very small and we are unable to make concessions regarding your request for a reduction. Upon approval, we have found that the industry's business is declining, as was explained in detail in the previous letter. Even as stated in your letter, with a monthly introduction of 20 people and a salary of 4 yuan per person, according to the regulations of the employment agency, they can only obtain half of the first month's salary of the introduced employee, which is 2 yuan. For 20 people, the monthly income is only 40 yuan. There are also cases where it is less than this amount. In addition to the rent, taxes, water and electricity, sanitation, business tax, and all other expenses, can they maintain it, can they have any surplus, and can they afford to bear the increased donation? The situation should be clear to you. The French Concession Board of Directors should base the collection of taxes on the ability of the taxpayers. They cannot plan to take out of people, regardless of whether the taxpayers can afford it, and increase donations at will. Moreover, the industry originally paid an annual business tax of 2 yuan. The proportion of the tax rate it bears is already heavier than other industries. Now, suddenly, another 24 yuan is added, which in number is more than twelve times. How can it be said that the amount of the donation is small? In short, the industry is really unable to bear the increased donation. The details should be known when the industry has been summoned by the police on several occasions. Considering the situation, the French Concession Board of Directors should give them consideration. The association has been repeatedly requested by taxpayers and knows that the matter is difficult. It is not possible not to report it again. It is not sticking to preconceived ideas, nor is it protecting the industry. It is sincerely reporting the suffering of society in detail. We hope that the French Concession Board of Directors will carefully consider it, submit a review, and condescend to approve a reduction in the donation. We also hope to be able to persuade the association to act as a mediator so that everything can be fair. Before this matter is resolved, please do not impose pressure again by cutting off water and electricity as coercion. This is our sincere prayer. To the Shanghai French Concession Board of Directors."

Among women, he is lonely for thousands of years, but now we see this person." This shows his admiration. People from other cities, due to the distance, could not visit the exhibition in person, so they sent people to request that the exhibits be taken to their cities for exhibition to satisfy their eyes. For example, Lv Siyin, the instructor of the Binbo People's Club, and others have come to discuss this matter.

### How to Read Books, Newspapers, and Magazines

Mr. Lv Shaoyu, a library expert, has been serving in the library field for more than ten years. His various books have long been valued by all sectors of society. Recently, he compiled the book "How to Read Books, Newspapers, and Magazines," which contributes the research findings and experiences of scholars at home and abroad to the readers. If scholars follow the reading methods he instructs, they can obtain the greatest learning results with less time and effort. The book is divided into three parts: upper, middle, and lower. The upper part is the method of reading books, the middle part is the method of reading newspapers, and the lower part is the method of reading magazines. A total of 28 essays are included, totaling 150,000 words. The language is simple, and the theory is thorough. Teachers and students of universities, middle schools, and primary schools, as well as young people with aspirations, should obtain a copy. The book is published by Youlian Publishing House at No. 1413, Xiafei Road, Shanghai, and distributed by the Local Humanistic Monthly. Local Life Bookstore, the author, and China Book and Magazine Company all sell the book.

### Oral Calligrapher and Painter Arrives in Shanghai

Mr. Liang Moqi, a painter and calligrapher from Xiamen Hainan Calligraphy and Painting Society, who travels around the country for exhibitions, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Fujian on the Jing'an ship. He is staying on the third floor of No. 12, Xinyongan Street, French Concession. It is heard that Mr. Liang's works do not use his hand to hold the brush, but he uses his mouth to bite the brush to write calligraphy and paint. He can write large characters in various styles and can paint up to four feet in size. Small characters can be written into a fan shape. He can also paint landscapes and figures with freehand ink orchids, which are the most wonderful. He has exhibited in Guangdong, Chaozhou, Meizhou, Shantou, and Fujian Province. Many celebrities from various places have given poems and inscriptions to welcome him. This time, he brought many works of calligraphers and painters from Fujian and Guangdong to Shanghai, and he plans to hold an exhibition. He is currently making preparations. When the exhibition opens, he will write calligraphy on the spot with his mouth, which should be spectacular.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong is sunny all around, with a moving and sharp southwest wind. The sky in the Yangtze River Basin is changing from worming overcast to a gradual change, with a southeast wind and fog or drizzle in several places. There is a low-pressure area in Hunan. The East China Sea and northern Taiwan are cloudy, with partial inch-sized and strong northeast to east winds.

Shanghai Private Girls' Middle School 13th Anniversary Celebration Special Issue

### Commemorative Address

— Chairman Wu Kaixian

Our school, from its founding to the present, has spanned thirty years. In these past thirty years, although various facilities have not reached our ideal state due to economic limitations, the number of young students from all over who come to study has increased year by year. The number of students this semester has reached 900, and their origins cover all provinces and cities in the country. At a time when women's education is not yet widespread, to have so many students disregard the distance and come here is a testament to the fact that our school has always been in a state of natural development, and therefore has been able to attract the close attention of people in the country! Now, our school is happily celebrating its 30th anniversary. All teachers and students have initiated a celebration meeting on the 30th of this month to show their joy; and to exhibit the achievements of the past three years, in order to seek criticism and guidance from people in society. We respectfully embrace the ancient teaching of thirty and stand, and briefly express our feelings to encourage the future.

First, running a school is a sacred social undertaking, and everyone knows the importance of its mission! Whether society is healthy or not depends entirely on the quality of school education. If the school has good education, then the young people who have been nurtured by good education will be healthy cells of the society and the country; if the school is not run well, and students are adversely affected, then these young people will be dangerous elements of the society and the country, and the impact on the future of the nation is extremely significant. Moreover, secondary education is a crucial key to the life of young people, which can not only make up for the shortcomings of primary education, but also lay the foundation for university education. Its importance is self-evident! General Moltke of Prussia once said: "The strength of Germany is due to the success of primary education!" It can be seen that the success or failure of school education is enough to influence the fate of the country. How can we not be careful about it? As we are at this 30th-anniversary celebration, looking ahead and looking back, we sincerely hope that all teachers and students will continue the spirit of serving the society in the past, strengthen the implementation of the school's original plan, work hard to make progress, create more healthy cells for the society, and cultivate more excellent talents for the country.

Second, we believe that women's education should focus on the cultivation of motherhood and the development of life skills. Because modern society is constituted by family organization; and the foundation of family organization lies in the relationship between spouses. If the relationship cannot be maintained permanently, or if motherhood cannot fulfill its responsibilities, it will be enough to cause family unrest and shake the foundation of social organization. Since the eastward spread of Europeanization, the country has been pursuing novelty in all aspects of life, marriage is regarded as a child's play, and the family is like a long journey. Thinking of this, I feel a thousand emotions! The ethics, morality, and life skills of the family are the fine threads that maintain the normal relationship between husband and wife. Whether for the benefit of the family or the happiness of the children, it depends on the maintenance of this bond. Therefore, we do not hesitate to loudly appeal to modern young people to be keenly aware of the sacredness of the spousal relationship and the importance of family responsibility, and today's women's education must pay attention to cultivating virtue and developing life skills, as a prelude to establishing a healthy family.

Third, Chinese women have always neglected the exercise of their own physical fitness, and the elders in the family have even more vague understanding of this. As a result, the willow waist and lotus steps are praised as beautiful stories. This kind of traditional misconception is the main reason for the weakness of the Chinese nation for thousands of years. Since motherhood is so weak, the children born must be misled by this congenital defect! In recent years, the government's education policy has actively promoted women's sports in order to strengthen the foundation of the country, but bad habits have not been eliminated, and promotion is difficult. I hope that all teachers and students of our school will actively promote it, so that everyone has a balanced development in intellectual, moral, and physical education. We cannot be satisfied with creating a few athletes.

The above three points are our minimum requirements. I think that under the leadership of Principal Tong, our school will be able to move steadily towards these three goals, and there is no need for us to elaborate.

### Honorary Chairman Mr. Wu Tiecheng

### School Affairs Overview

— Principal Tong Xingbai

Preface

I have been appointed as the principal of the school for three years. In these three years, I am very ashamed that I have made very few achievements due to the interaction between economic and environmental pressures. However, in order to develop women's education, in addition to expanding the school buildings, I have also worked hard to enrich the equipment and improve personnel affairs. Furthermore, thanks to the maintenance of people in the society and the false reputation of students from all over, the number of students in the recent two semesters has suddenly increased to more than 900, breaking a new record that has never been seen before. Although this point can be gratifying to the people in the society who love our school, it has also increased our responsibility in education. In the future, teachers and students of our school are willing to concentrate manpower and financial resources to seek development in both material and spiritual aspects, and expect to achieve greater achievements. Furthermore, we hope that people in the society and famous educators will help and supervise us with dual sympathy, so that we can reach the ideal level of women's education.

A. School History

Six years before the founding of the Republic of China, the five sisters of the Shanwang Su Benyan established our school in Shouli, Waiyuan, Xidou. In the second year of the Republic of China, they applied to the Shanghai County Government for land to build school buildings themselves at the intersection of Wenmiao Road, Ximen. In the sixteenth year, the school board of directors reorganized according to regulations and elected Wang Su Benyan as the principal. In the twentieth year, it was approved by the Municipal Education Bureau and filed with the Ministry of Education; in February of the twenty-third year, it was ordered by the Municipal Education Bureau to reorganize the school board of directors and appointed Xingbai as the principal, up to now, a total of thirty years. Before the 23rd year of our school, the school administration was not divided in detail, which inevitably made it difficult to handle affairs and develop. After the reorganization by the Bureau in the same year, the administrative system was established, the school regulations were revised, the training and education policies and development plans were determined; and new school buildings were built, equipment was enriched, discipline was rectified, and the level was improved. As a result, the number of applicants increased year by year from more than 300 to more than 900. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the school, I will make a brief report on the current situation of school affairs and the improvement plan, and I hope that Chinese people will correct it.

B. General Affairs

(1) Equipment

Since the completion of the new school buildings, all the equipment of our school has not been completed. From the first semester of the third year of freedom, such as physics and chemistry instruments, books, repairs, sports, etc., special funds were stipulated and gradually added. Therefore, within three years, in addition to the original ones, statistics show that the addition of physics and chemistry, medicine, sports, scout equipment, books, etc., is no less than 10,000 yuan; in addition, a physics and chemistry laboratory and a toilet were built; two teacher bathrooms; one teacher and staff dormitory; one male and female worker dormitory; one library, one reading room, one school medical room, one recuperation room, and one storage room; and all the school desks and chairs were re-added according to the grade level and age. Other teaching tools and equipment are even more difficult to count. In the future, it should be gradually increased to make the equipment more perfect.

(2) School Buildings

The original school buildings of our school were 21 middle-seat buildings, 6 rear-seat buildings, and 4 bungalows. The front east side of the three-story building can only accommodate 400 to 500 students, which was originally insufficient. After the reorganization, a five-story new school building was rebuilt in the west bungalow in the third year of Gan. Since the last semester, the number of students has increased to more than 900. The number of classrooms has increased to 17 levels. Although the number of people has increased, fortunately, the space can be used, and unnecessary houses can be repaired and applied. If there is no active plan in the future to dominate the construction of the middle-seat building, it is feared that those who come to study will be crowded. The new school building is five stories high, and the bottom floor is divided into seven rooms for offices, the second, third, and fourth floors are divided into twelve classrooms, and the fifth floor is used as a flat top for students to relax. However, due to the large number of people, the open space is very insufficient. In addition to developing to the space, there is no possibility of expansion, which is not without regret.

### Chairman Mr. Wu Kaixian

(3) Clearing School Debts

The school price of our school has reached 40,000 yuan before and after, accounting for almost half of the annual income, and it is quite difficult to maintain. Fortunately, the income and expenditure of previous sessions have tried to save money, in order to gradually pay off the school debts. As of this semester, more than 20,000 yuan has been repaid, and the remaining 10,000 yuan. If there are no other accidents, the repayment period should not be far away.

### Part of the Awards and Prizes Won by Our School in the Past Three Years

Spring and Autumn
— (Tang Zenggeng)

Love, it's not calling you to sincerely indulge in the embrace of people you love, being muddleheaded all day long, it's not calling you to raise the banner of "love" and look down on everyone on the battlefield of love. Of course, it's not calling you to forget everything for the sake of love; love, in fact, is asking you to love the public, love society, and love your country. You should use love in a broad sense to cover up love in a narrow sense. Only love in a broad sense is the instinct that everyone should have.

Indeed, young people cannot do without the comfort of love, just like a barren garden hoping to be irrigated, but please open your eyes and take a look: how many have returned from the battlefield of love with triumph? How many have fallen into the sea of ​​suffering forever? Do you hope to grab victory from the middle of love? Or do you hope to get bitter juice from the middle of love? There are two avenues in front of you, and you need to choose for yourself.

Young people who take love as life, please wake up, is this a time to talk about love exclusively? Is there a sharp steel knife on your head? Are there fierce enemies in front and behind? The circle of love will not let you indulge in it all day long. You should use your sword of wisdom to cut off the thread of love, and you should also cut off the deep love and tenderness of your lover at all costs.

### The Sugar Blowing Artist

— Zhou Xian

Those who knead flour figures are praised by literati as nameless street artists, and seem to have a very long history. But it seems that no literati have ever mentioned the art of sugar blowers.

In the places where civilians live, especially in slums, the footprints of these sugar blowers can often be seen. The burden of sugar blowers is similar to that of flour figure makers. Two crossed frames support a wooden box, which is the workplace. On the wooden box, a firewood broom stands upright, which is used to hedgehog together the various toys that have been blown up. When this kind of worker stops his burden, or in the process of working, after a considerable amount of time, when he hits the broken small gong a few times, children always gather around in front of him, looking with greedy eyes, and realizing that this kind of fun thing is sure to be sweet. However, sugar blowers are not only welcomed by children, but adults also stop and marvel at the superbness of their art.

If flour figure makers are praised as street artists, then sugar blowers seem to deserve it even more. Because although flour figure makers have superb skills, they are still inevitably suspected of piling up and piecing together, while sugar blowers can arbitrarily pull out a thread from a whole piece of sugar, and from this thin thread, blow air into the whole piece of sugar, so that the sugar swells up. More use of skilled techniques to make this swollen sugar into chickens, ducks, cats, and dogs. Those with more refined skills can even blow out the shapes of female students, red-headed foreigners, etc. Although it is exquisite, it is not up to the products of flour figure makers. However, if we look at it with the eyes of the twentieth century, the products of sugar blowers have a simple color, rough and neat lines, and majestic contours, which seem to have some flavor of so-called post-impressionism. But this is just saying so, it is bound to be regarded as a madman to talk about these things for this kind of street vendor.

Recently, I was chatting with a sugar blower, and I learned that it is not easy to eat this bowl of rice. It takes two or three years of practice to learn the skill of blowing air from sugar threads. After learning the skill of blowing air, you learn to blow simple things such as small bedpans and water pipes. After learning dozens of kinds, you can come out to sell your skills and cheat money. Although they don't have a guild of peers, it is said that there is absolutely no one who doesn't know how to blow a dozen kinds of toys. Generally, those with poor skills are active in various parts of the inland. In large cities such as Shanghai, it is not uncommon for those who make a living by blowing sugar to be able to blow twenty or thirty kinds of toys. Those with high skills can blow whatever they see. However, this is not a aristocratic thing after all, so it is said that the best income is only half a dollar a day. Fortunately, most of these people are farmers from various parts of northern Jiangsu. During the slack season, they come to various places in Jiangsu and Shanghai with their families and use this as a sideline, so although the income is small, it is not a serious problem.

But from a hygienic point of view, sugar blowers, the things they blow up, children, as delicious sugar food, when we try to close our eyes and think about it, how dangerous is it?

Discussion

### The Future Position of the Western Mediterranean

— I

According to yesterday's London Times, the Spanish Civil War incident is felt here that Rome has broken the neutrality agreement. The Manchester Guardian claims that the current Spanish war is no longer a civil war. The future position of the western Mediterranean has become a problem. Indeed, the Spanish war is nominally a civil war, but in fact, it is already a foreign war, which is already a well-known fact. However, can this kind of foreign war be gradually eliminated due to this non-interference in the Spanish Civil War monitoring plan, or will it be expanded even more as a result? This is a very important issue at present!

The leader of the Spanish rebels is General Franco, but this general is completely a puppet, and the one who is manipulating behind the scenes is someone else, who is about to be called out. Therefore, this Spanish war is more appropriate to say that it is a war between fascists and non-fascists than to say it is a civil war and a foreign war. So far, the Spanish Civil War has been going on for several months, and it is still advancing and retreating like sawing wood, and the outcome is undecided. The most suffering are the Spanish people, whose lives and property are sacrificed, which is difficult to calculate in numbers. The result is only that both gamblers are betting as a last resort. What is it for in Spain?

Therefore, I thought of the Spanish Civil War. Although it is a contest arena between fascists and non-fascists, it is ultimately because of the misfortune of the country that the rebellious elements and ambitious jackals emerged, which led to the intrusion of foreign forces. Assuming that there is no such person as General Franco in the country, then even if foreign forces want to intrude, they cannot intrude. As the saying goes, "The fence is broken and wild dogs drill in." This is indeed a great misfortune for Spain, but according to the current situation, it has become such a stalemate. Not only can Spain not clean up itself, but even those who help the murderers cannot clean up for a while.

Now, the British and French countries, in view of the Spanish Civil War, have a great tendency to prolong and expand, so they launched the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War and stipulated the sea and land monitoring plan, indicating that everyone is not allowed to go to help any aspect of the Spanish Civil War. Assuming that this plan can be implemented and effective, it is a great opportunity to quell the matter. However, this plan is naturally approved by the non-fascist side, while the fascist Germany is pretending to be foolish. Without making a statement, Italy is very active, and has a tendency to not give up until Spain is razed to the ground. Because Italy's help to the rebels is already not small. According to Russian reports, there are as many as 60,000 Italian troops entering Spain. Italy uses such a huge force, but it cannot overthrow the government, and it is also a bit embarrassing in terms of face.

Therefore, it is intentionally and passively in the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War, and has always maintained a stance of welcoming and rejecting. However, this sea and land military monitoring plan cannot achieve considerable results, and it is likely to turn the Spanish Civil War into a world war. I am very afraid of it.

### Abandoned City

— Ya Min

At dusk, I climbed onto the top of the Manchurian city wall, standing amidst the broken ramparts and ruined battlements, overlooking the crumbling buildings of the previous dynasty. The blood-red sunset engulfed the entire city, and I felt as if I were standing in the ruins after the Great Fire of Rome, lamenting the city's past prosperity.

Where has the prosperity of only a few decades ago gone? Now, no matter how hard I look, I cannot find a single house that is even slightly intact. There are no streets, no shops; the remains of houses lie horizontally, crushing the bluestone pavements. It's suppertime, but not a wisp of smoke rises from the city. Houses have their roofs torn off, exposing their chests to the desolate wind, like abandoned coffins without lids. Stray dogs can enter the inner rooms at any time, without having to go through the door, and leisurely lift their hind legs to urinate beside the broken pillars and abandoned stoves. In the shady corners of the houses, lush green grass grows.

What about the residents of this city? Women strolling leisurely on the streets, smoking long pipes; men who love snuff, receiving royal rations since birth. Where have these conquerors gone now? Not even a grave remains. Only an old beggar leans against a half-ruined wall, taking off his tattered jacket to catch fleas, while a mangy dog licks the sores on his leg. I know him; the children call him "Old Manchu." It is said that he was once a "Baturu warrior." Now, this unworthy descendant has lost the glory of his ancestors, relying on the pity of his former slaves to survive. The story of his ancestors conquering the world with thirteen horses carrying thirteen suits of armor is now a bygone glory for him.

The lonely flagpole of the Commandant's Office stares sadly at the remnants of the mansion beneath its feet, accompanied by the nearly collapsing gate tower. Now, only it still stands tall, supporting the dignity of the past. But eroded by time and wind and rain, its aging body is also becoming increasingly thin. The wind of the northern lands is fickle; who knows when it will shake and fall down, allowing a wood-gathering child to end its final fate. Now, in the fading sunlight, it blushes and tells old dreams to the clouds. There is also no display of the yellow dragon flag on the bare pole.

Or perhaps the flagpole can still point out: in this city, that was the Beizi's mansion, that was the Banner camp. Cavalrymen wearing red-tasseled hats galloped through the bustling market, the opera house was filled with noisy voices, and the teahouses were crowded with people drinking tea. But now it has become a desolate field of sand and gravel, with a thin wisp of evening smoke rippling between the broken and ruined walls.

Dusk rises along the city walls, and I stagger down the city wall. At the deep city gate, the faithful old gatekeeper is already waiting there. I greet him as usual.

"Are you closing the city gate?"

"Don't you want to play a little longer? Actually, this city gate doesn't need to be closed anymore." The old man smiled bitterly, a sigh disappearing into his pale beard. I saw an unconquerable loneliness on the old man's face, comparing the past and present.

Silently walking out of the city, the creaking sound of the city gate cuts off my lingering gaze.

### On the Road

— Luo Zhihua

In the melancholy and uncertain autumn, when you not only cannot see the sun but also cannot feel its warmth, and even forget about it, it is common to get lost in the autumn forest. You are pulled off the main road, lose all the small paths, and get tired of searching for them. You grit your teeth and step straight into the dense forest ahead, crossing rotten trees knocked down by the wind, and crossing rugged, muddy mounds! Finally, you will often find a main road!

Every time I feel disappointed about a thorny matter, I always lie in bed, watching the gray ceiling with both eyes, or watching how the flowing clouds in the sky change and move, finally sighing wearily, and thinking back to that thorny matter.

In our family, sighing is not allowed. The elders will sternly ask you: "Why are you sighing when you are so young?" They reward a person for walking with their chest out, not being timid at all. Naturally, it is the same on the long road of life. However, I often sigh, having learned many sentences from Turgenev's essays and novels, such as: smoke, what is not smoke! ... While young, I lived very melancholically, but I also loved spring and liveliness. I walked on such a contradictory, muddy road.

Later, I read Gorky's books, was educated by the stories in his books, joined new rivers, and lived a new life. But I was still often tired, sitting by the roadside, holding my head in my hands, letting the cold night wind blow. Gorky, this brilliant linguist, the great technician of the human soul, said the words above. —"...you will often find a main road."

So, I walked again.

Oh, this rugged, muddy road, where is the end? While looking forward, I lift this foot and put it down, and then laboriously lift that one...

When walking on the road, I don’t know how many people come over to talk to you, they use various different ways, say different things, and say it very definitely, as if only his road is correct:

“Young man! This road is endless, on this road, there is fear and distress, although some people say that at the end there is sunshine and warm spring breeze, but how many people have you seen reach the end? — Those who say it is happy there are all dead now.” As he spoke, he took out a painting from his pocket, which depicted a green field, and young men and women were happily playing on the field. He said: "You should stop, you can live happily here for the rest of your life." However, he would not allow me to look at the back of the painting, because there was a skull on it.

Then another person came over and said:

“Young man: It is a very admirable thing for you to pursue the sun and pursue the light, but haven’t you seen that in front, behind, I don’t know how many people have died, the land you are stepping on is built of their blood, flesh, and bones. This is a very difficult thing.” He pretended to care about me and said to me: “You should walk according to the method I pointed out to you, because those who died were too good at resisting, and they were too good at using their hands and feet. If a tree branch blocks his way, he will definitely destroy it, and if a small worm bites his foot, he will step on it, so that when he encounters a big storm, he will die in the dark deep river! You have to walk slowly, if someone blocks you, ignore him, sit down and rest for a while, if someone drags you and doesn’t let you go, or wants you to retreat a few miles, just lie down and have a good rest!

“Then, sir, haven’t you seen the blood-lettered monument by the roadside? It contains the words of people from the past: Young man, catch up! Remove all obstacles, and the end will arrive!

“That’s calling you to send your life quickly!”

I ignored him and kept walking forward. All kinds of nagging words kept stopping me, stubbornly talking to me. Their mouths seemed to be made of iron, and they were not afraid of being worn out.

Sometimes, an old man with rapid breathing lies by the side of the road, he says:

"Young man, walk faster, the end is coming — I'll catch up with you as soon as I catch my breath! ... Don't stop, it's just ahead!"

The gentlemen by the roadside laugh coldly and say: "Look, this old man is flattering the young man—he wants the young man to commemorate him when he reaches the end, hold a memorial service, or take him over to take care of him in his old age!"

People are waving enthusiastically at me, stretching out their thick arms, waiting for me to run over and give me a long embrace!

"You grit your teeth and step straight into the dense forest ahead, crossing rotten trees knocked down by the wind, crossing rugged, muddy mounds — finally, you will often find a main road!" Moreover, someone has already reached the end of that road, they are waving to you, singing, preparing to embrace you...

Looking back at the thousands of people following you, walking in the same direction as you! ... Forward!

### Hometown

— Meng Hua

Sending a friend abroad, I boarded a large steamship crossing the Pacific Ocean for the first time, on a certain early spring evening.

The huge iron maze was magnificent, and many noble foreigners came and went like shuttles, but in a corner, I saw a ragged compatriot, his greasy long gown shining under the brilliant ship lights.

He glanced at us sharply, and then immediately chased after
