### Chiang Kai-shek's Opinion After the Sudden Change in the Situation in Peiping and Tientsin

Exert All Efforts and Take Full Responsibility to Save the Future Crisis; Small Military Setbacks Must Not Be Considered Failures; Resolve to Perish with the Country

[Nanjing] Regarding the government's policy after the sudden change in the situation in Peiping and Tientsin, Chairman Chiang, in response to inquiries from journalists on the 29th, issued the following opinions:

(Question) Chairman Song's sudden departure from Peiping led to the loss of an important town. I don't know how the central government will handle the issue of his responsibility.

(Answer) From a military perspective, Song should have gone to Baoding long ago and should not have been stationed in Peiping and Tientsin. I have always advocated this. As the supreme military commander of the country, I also bear administrative responsibility. All the military failures in Peiping and Tientsin are not Song's responsibility. I am willing to bear it all myself. I am confident that I can exert all my efforts and take full responsibility to save the future crisis. It should be known that the current situation in Peiping and Tientsin has long been foreseen by discerning people in the country. The aggression and oppression of the Japanese military and political forces has been going on for a long time, so the current situation is by no means accidental. Moreover, temporary military setbacks should not be considered failures. Furthermore, the war in Peiping and Tientsin cannot be considered over. Since the Japanese army is deliberately invading China and is willing to use all kinds of means, it can be known that today's battle in Peiping and Tientsin is only the beginning of its war of aggression and by no means the end of the battle. The people of the country only need to have a united determination to face the national crisis together. As for the issue of Song's personal responsibility, there is no need to pay attention to it.

(Question) What is the government's policy towards Japan in the future?

(Answer) Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, I clearly announced at the Lushan Conference that this matter will be the limit of our last juncture, and listed the minimum position for resolving this matter, with a total of four points. This is known to both domestic and foreign parties and can never be changed. At that time, I said that I was not seeking war, but only responding to war. Now that this last juncture has arrived, how can we still regard the Peiping and Tientsin affairs as a local issue and allow the Japanese army to slaughter us at will, or even create a puppet organization? The government has the responsibility to protect the territory, sovereignty, and people. It can only launch a comprehensive plan, lead the whole country to fight unitedly, and sacrifice to the end to defend the country. After this, there will be no possibility of a local solution. The people of the country must know that the four points I mentioned last time are actually the boundary between survival and death. No matter how much our army has not failed at present, even if we fail, we must have the determination to perish with the country, and there is absolutely no reason for compromise and surrender. In short, the government's limit to Japan is consistent from beginning to end and will not change at all, that is, it cannot lose any territory or sovereignty. At this critical moment of the survival of our motherland, the people of the country will surely be able to fight to the end unitedly. I have decided on all necessary measures for this matter. I only hope that the people of the country will be calm and cautious, do their duty, and have the determination to sacrifice for the country together, then the final victory will surely belong to us.

[Guihua] Due to the worsening situation in Peiping and Tientsin, Generals Fu Zuoyi, Tang Enbo, and Zhao Chengshou ordered the troops on the front and rear lines of Suiyuan to be on high alert and to step up training to prepare for any eventuality. In addition to the newly added equipment for the troops stationed in eastern and northern Suiyuan, the safety of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway Line has also been properly guarded by a certain unit. According to information obtained from various sources, although the bandits and puppets in Chahar Province have been actively increasing their numbers recently, the actual number has only increased by about two regiments, and they are mainly focused on defense. If they rashly attempt to invade Suiyuan, it is not worth our army's suppression. The authorities have recently been strictly arresting traitors and enemy spies, and several people have been captured one after another.

The meeting adjourned at 11:50 AM. At noon, the organizers of the conference, Chairman Wang and President Jiang, invited all guests and participants to a banquet in the library auditorium. During the banquet, guests proposed that the participants of the second session of the conference send a telegram to encourage Chairman Song Zheyuan and all the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army.

The original text of the telegram to Song and all officers and soldiers of the 29th Army is as follows: To Chairman Song and all officers and soldiers of the 29th Army: Upon the commencement of the second session of the conference, we respectfully read your electrifying message, and we deeply admire your loyal and courageous officers and soldiers' determination to defend the territory and resist the enemy. We were further inspired and impassioned by subsequent war reports. Upon hearing that you have moved to Baoding, we sincerely hope that you will work together with the various armies sent by the Central Government to resist the war to the end. We, the undersigned, are not talented, but we vow to do our best to follow in your footsteps. Every piece of land in China is covered with the bloodstains of every citizen. We would rather see the land and people turn to ashes than allow the enemy to trample over us at their leisure. We sincerely extend our best wishes for victory. Respectfully, all participants of the second session of the Lushan Conference, Yan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Rescuing Peiping and Tianjin

— Ren

The July 7th-8th Lugouqiao Incident. From the moment it occurred, everyone saw that this was a planned action by the Japanese. It was the beginning of an attempt to encompass North China. Therefore, we also felt that to resolve this incident peacefully, it would only be possible if the other side reined in their horses at the edge of the cliff. Otherwise, for us, there was only one path: resistance.

The start of the great battle on the morning of the 28th. This indicates that we have already set out on the path we should be taking. We are no longer worried, nor are we hesitating. According to the news obtained last night (29th), although our garrison in Peiping has begun to retreat due to the rebellion of some traitors, our loyal and courageous soldiers in the Tianjin, Lugouqiao, and Dagu areas are still fighting bloodily. It is also reported that Division Commander Zhao Dengyu and General Tong Linge have gloriously died for the country in the Nanyuan Huaihe battle.

This Peiping-Tianjin resistance, in fact, is just the prelude to a full-scale war. However, we must not ignore the success or failure of this prelude battle. We must deeply understand that whether or not China will be swallowed up by Japan today depends on whether we can maintain North China. And whether North China can be maintained depends on whether we can defend Hebei and Chahar. And whether Hebei and Chahar can be defended depends on whether we can hold Peiping and Tianjin. Peiping and Tianjin, whether viewed from a military, transportation, economic, or political perspective, can be said to be the heart of Hebei and Chahar. If Peiping and Tianjin fall into the hands of the enemy, they can control Hebei and Chahar militarily and economically. At the same time, they can be used as the main base for encompassing North China. Once North China is gone, the areas north and south of the Yangtze River will inevitably face serious threats.

Therefore, in the current resistance, we can regard Peiping and Tianjin as a lifeline. Whether this lifeline is broken through by the enemy will determine the success or failure of our resistance. According to the situation last night, our garrison in Peiping has already withdrawn. At the same time, Shaho, Qinghe, Xiyuan, Nanyuan, and Wanping in the suburbs of Peiping have all been under heavy pressure from the enemy. Only the Mentougou route can still connect Peiping city with the outside. Under this situation, Peiping has obviously fallen into an extremely serious and critical situation. Here, only in Tianjin do we still occupy a considerable advantage. However, according to news reports, those currently defending this important Tianjin area are only isolated troops of the 29th Army. Whether they can hold Tianjin depends on whether they can get reinforcements.

Judging from the Central Government's repeated declarations and talks regarding the North China Incident, we believe that there is a determination to "fight." We do not know to what extent this determination has reached. However, we believe that at this critical juncture of Peiping and Tianjin, it seems to be a great opportunity for the Central Government to concretely demonstrate its determination. At the same time, it is also a necessary period for resistance. Currently, the Japanese imperialists have revealed their ferocious faces. Cruel artillery fire is being fired everywhere. Apart from launching a full-scale war immediately, we have no second path to take. In other words, now that peace is hopeless and the final moment has arrived, we only have sacrifice. The top priority now is to rescue Peiping and Tianjin with a spirit of advancing one after another.

### Japanese Invasion of China Condemned by the World

British Newspapers Bitterly Discuss the Sino-Japanese Situation, Saying It Is Due to British Weakness

[London] British newspapers today all emphasize the pro-China trends in the Ganwei incident and elaborate on them in their commentaries. Reuters, after inquiring in various places in the Far East, discovered various different opinions. People in Tokyo, seeing that Japanese trade has been greatly affected, deeply hope that the conflict in North China will end soon. What is worrying is that the Kwantung Army is ambitious and the anti-Japanese sentiment in China will be an obstacle to the resolution. Most opinions believe that there will eventually be a resolution, because the 29th Army is being driven out, and the Japanese should be able to comply. They know that being too hasty will be equal to suicide. The Manchester Guardian commented on the Far East situation, saying that the Japanese should understand early on that the Chinese people will never allow Peiping to be occupied by foreigners. The Japanese should further consider their position in the Far East and the prosperity they have gained from living in peace with their neighbors. There is no doubt about Japan's reputation and military strength, but even its most fierce soldiers admit that conquering China is no longer possible. Its economists are even more aware of how significant the economic impact will be after the outbreak of war. If there is no moral or legal reason, and they are unwilling to be in a situation that is harmful and unprofitable, and they still engage in war, they will be condemned by the world. The Birmingham Post said that since Japan's successful invasion of Manchuria, we have not seen anything that can stop the war. Japanese soldiers are not afraid of foreign intervention, and Chinese politicians do not hope for foreign intervention. The West has abandoned its right to direct intervention. It is doubtful whether indirect negotiations have also been abandoned. Is it not possible to slightly suppress Japan's desires and slightly calm China's fears by reiterating the Open Door Policy today, so as to influence Sino-Japanese policy? (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 29th)

[London] Today's editorial in the News Chronicle stated that the Western powers will inevitably take action in this war in North China, not because it is not related to our interests, nor because we approve of Japan's conquest of North China, but because we did not take any action on the Manchurian incident six years ago, which has led to our inability to take any action today. This new war further demonstrates the weakness of the British government in 1931 and 1932, which not only abandoned collective security but also abandoned British interests. Since then, the Abyssinian, Rhineland, and Spanish events have occurred one after another, and now an incident has occurred in China. All of this is due to the British government's show of weakness. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### French Newspapers Comment on the Sino-Japanese Situation

Coordination Is No Longer Possible; Will the Soviet Union Sit Idly By?

[Paris] French newspapers have various questions about the cause of the North China incident and make various different speculations. "Le Journal" stated, "The matter has reached this point, and coordination seems no longer possible. Everything must be left to the mercy of the cannons. But in the Far East, even after the start of military action, diplomatic activities can still be carried out. This is what we must not forget." "L'Ère Nouvelle" stated, "The Soviet Union in the Far East cannot retreat any further, and Japan's progress has no end. Therefore, the pace of Japan and Russia is slower than slow, but their trend towards mutual conflict is inevitable." "Le Temps" also reported, "Will Moscow listen to it naturally? This is a big secret in the future, but if Japan is bound to win, it is also difficult to believe. China has been rectifying its national defense for five years, and its resistance is much stronger than when the Manchurian War of September 18 occurred." The Communist Party's "L'Humanité" further stated, "China must drive out Japanese forces, and it must also drive out Japanese forces. But Britain must not impose the penalties on Spain on China (according to what is called penalties, it should refer to the embargo on supplies to Spain)." In addition, "L'Ordre" commented, "If Japan wages war on Japanese cities, it is difficult to believe." This statement is quite sufficient to represent the ability of general French newspapers.

### Our Embassy in the UK Issues a Statement

States Our Desire for Peace; Japan Deliberately Expanding the Situation

[London] The Chinese Embassy in the UK recently issued a statement stating the Chinese government's desire to maintain peace, briefly stating, "The Chinese government has repeatedly proposed to the Japanese side to determine the date for the withdrawal of troops by both sides. Japan has not only failed to accept it but has also gradually increased the deployment of large numbers of troops to North China. During this period, the local military authorities of both China and Japan in North China had negotiated a solution. The Central Government believed that this solution was not very incompatible with the government's position and therefore did not raise any objections. Thus, the Chinese government's extreme tolerance and efforts to maintain peace are generally known. However, Japan not only does not withdraw its troops but also continues to transport large numbers of troops to the Peiping-Tianjin area. It is self-evident that Japan is deliberately expanding the current crisis in order to pursue its predetermined plan in North China." (Central News Agency Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Xiao Zhenying Leaves the United States to Return to the Country to Participate in the War

Says That the People of the Country Share the Same Hatred of the Enemy and Will Surely Win the Final Victory

[San Francisco] Xiao Zhenying, former mayor of Tianjin and Chief of Staff of the 29th Army, returned to the country today on a Pacific Airlines plane. According to what he told the guest, this war will lead to a long and bloody war. China's true unity is the first time in Chinese history. We deeply believe that we will be able to defeat Japan. We have exhausted all kinds of peaceful plans, and finally, we have to take self-defense actions. Mr. Pu is determined to return to the country to participate in the war.

### Our Three Ambassadors to Europe Hold a Meeting in London

Frequent Contacts Between the UK, US, and France; The United States Considers Invoking the Neutrality Act

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden met with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and US Ambassador Bingham this afternoon, and the talks lasted for quite a long time. Before meeting with Eden, Guo Taiqi had a meeting with Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, Gu Weijun, Ambassador to France, and Jiang Tingfu, Ambassador to Russia. Ambassadors Gu and Jiang came here specifically for the meeting from Paris and Moscow. According to British diplomatic sources, the main content of Eden's talks with the US and Chinese ambassadors today was to discuss the issue of mediating the conflict between China and Japan. During the talks, politicians from the UK and the US were in complete agreement that the conflict between China and Japan must be ended quickly. However, they also acknowledged that Japan has refused any mediation and that the US has maintained its opposition to joint action by various countries. Therefore, it is impossible to carry out mediation at this time. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch, 28th)

[London] Ambassador Jiang Tingfu took a plane this morning and rushed back to Moscow. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch, 29th)

[Paris] Dr. Gu Weijun, Chinese Ambassador to France, recently went to London and held a meeting with Vice President Kong, British Ambassador Guo Taiqi, and Russian Ambassador Jiang Tingfu. He has now returned here and immediately visited Foreign Minister Daladier to discuss the Sino-Japanese incident. Daladier then met with Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz and British Ambassador to France Phipps to discuss the situation in the Far East. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th) [Washington] The White House announced today that President Roosevelt is paying close attention to the turbulent situation in the Far East. His greatest concern is the safety of American citizens in Peiping. The President is also paying close attention to the development of the situation in North China to see if it is possible to implement the Neutrality Act. However, he also stated that he is unwilling to recognize that China and Japan have entered a state of war and intends to avoid advocating an international policy on the current situation of the two countries. Today, a reliable diplomatic source stated that Japan has dispatched 30,000 troops within the country to North China, intending to force the current authorities to leave and replace them with pro-Japanese elements. It is reported that Japan does not want to annex North China but wants a government that is willing to cooperate economically with Japan. (National Telegram, 28th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently stated in a press conference that the issue of evacuating American citizens in Peiping due to the recurrence of the war in North China is currently under consideration, but no decision has been made yet. Hull also said that foreign residents in Peiping have discussed ways to maintain the safety of foreign residents. The Secretary of State did not mention that he had instructed the naval authorities to gather warships in Tianjin for the use of the expatriates, but officials said that there was no need to worry about transportation, because there were the "Black Hawk" in Yantai and the "Cannoppo" in Qingdao, and there were eight other destroyers that could be mobilized in Yantai. Furthermore, the White House is paying close attention to the situation in the Far East in order to decide on issues such as invoking the Neutrality Act. It is reported that officials are very concerned about and cautious about the Sino-Japanese War. Special Envoy Davis entered the White House today and had discussions with the President. The shooting of an American sailor by stray bullets has raised the long-standing question of the effectiveness of the embassy guards. The situation of the Boxer Rebellion no longer exists, but if the British embassy guard does not withdraw, the United States will continue to be stationed. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 28th)

[London] Someone asked Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons today whether he would convene a meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council in response to the crisis between China and Japan. The Foreign Secretary replied that although the current situation is very serious, he is not yet prepared to take the initiative. (National Telegram, 28th)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today the information he had obtained regarding the recent incident in North China, saying that the British Ambassador to Tokyo had sent an urgent note to the Japanese government opposing the outbreak of war in this city. British citizens in Pingcheng have been ordered to enter the Legation Quarter to prevent danger. The Foreign Secretary then detailed the agreement reached between Song Zheyuan and the Japanese side. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Sir Milner inquired whether the Japanese were now demanding police powers in Peiping. Did this request exceed the agreement? The Foreign Secretary replied that if the information obtained by the Member of Parliament was accurate, it would be much more stringent than everything he had heard in recent days. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### British House of Commons Discusses the North China War

The Leader of the Labour Party Asked Questions Very Fiercely; Eden Said He Was in Contact with Various Countries

[London] The British House of Commons today discussed matters related to the situation in North China. The leader of the Liberal Labour Party, Attlee, said that the current situation in the Far East is equal to the Manchurian Incident and asked Eden what steps the British government would take if China petitioned the League of Nations. Eden replied that the situation in the Far East is indeed very critical, but as far as he knows, no request has been made to the League of Nations. He said yesterday that Japan and the United States are not members of the League of Nations, and the United Kingdom is not prepared to take the initiative. Attlee asked again, in this case, will the League of Nations be unable to help when a member state is invaded by a non-member state? Eden replied that this was not a fair interpretation and said that there was an exceptional situation in the Far East. Although Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant has a way to resolve disputes between member states and non-member states, this depends on whether the non-member states can cooperate. Former Indian Affairs Minister Penn Weier asked Foreign Secretary Eden to declare to Japan that the United Kingdom could not agree to another piece of Chinese territory being cut off from the sovereignty of the Nanjing government. Eden said that various declarations had been issued in the past two days. The government deeply regretted the situation because the government previously hoped that the situation in the Far East could be generally eased, and it is now impossible to improve it. Eden added that he was in constant contact with the French government, but both sides did not feel that the opportunity to petition the League of Nations had matured. Later, Liberal Party Member of Parliament Mandel asked whether the government had discussed convening a meeting of the signatories of the Anti-War Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. Eden replied, yes, these matters had been discussed. Attlee declared that he would raise the China issue again during the closing debate tomorrow. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 29th)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that the British Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Dodd, had been ordered to make representations to the Japanese government on the safety of British citizens. As a result, the Japanese government and local Japanese military officials had issued certain guarantees. Dodd had also explained to the Japanese government the seriousness of the situation and the great military danger it contained. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)

### Anti-Japanese Associations Established Sequentially in Various Counties of Southern Fujian

Japanese Side Prepares to Use Gulangyu as a Reception Area for Japanese Nationals in Fuzhou and Xiamen

Xiamen correspondence: With the outbreak of the war in Hebei, public sentiment in Fujian Province is extremely激昂. In Zhangzhou, the Zhangzhou All Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association was the first to be established. The Kuomintang branch in Longxi, the county government, the 157th Division, and 17 groups from the business, industrial, and student sectors were selected as committee members. A meeting of all circles on the 24th resolved to immediately establish the Zhangzhou Extraordinary Period Security Committee, placing the Anti-Japanese Support Association under its Propaganda Committee. Furthermore, the Fujian Province All Circles United Anti-Japanese Support Association was established in Fuzhou on the 20th, with representatives from the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, various departments, the 80th Division, and business, industrial, and student groups serving as committee members. It stipulated that all united cities in the province should establish All Circles Anti-Japanese Support Associations. Those established in recent days include Jinjiang County and Nan'an County in the Quanzhou region, the Longyan County in western Fujian, and Changtai County and Shima Town in the Longxi region in the Zhangzhou region. Other counties are rapidly preparing. The Quanzhou Chamber of Commerce is also planning to stockpile grain, and Changtai County is planning to stockpile grain, salt, and prepare for air defense. All circles in Xiamen had long discussed forming the Xiamen City Anti-Japanese Support Association, but due to special circumstances, it was postponed until the afternoon of the 28th. On the Japanese side, on the evening of the 25th, the Maizuru-class destroyer "Uzuki" was dispatched from Magong Port to Xiamen, adding to the "Yubari", which had arrived in Xiamen nine days prior, bringing the total to two ships. Rear Admiral Ōkuma, commander of the 5th Torpedo Squadron, is currently stationed in Xiamen, commanding the Japanese Navy between Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou. The Japanese consul in Xiamen convened a meeting of Japanese residents the other day, deciding that in case of necessity, Japanese residents in Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Shantou would be evacuated to Gulangyu. They designated the Japanese Consulate in Gulangyu, the Bo'ai Hospital, the Yamato Club, and the Salt Field Inn as reception centers, believing that Gulangyu, being an island, would be easier to control. Currently, there are only two to three hundred Japanese residents in Fuzhou and Xiamen, who have not yet evacuated. As for Taiwanese Japanese residents, there are 18,000 to 19,000 in Xiamen, making evacuation difficult. In the past week, Taiwanese have been holding meetings by district according to their Baojia organization, with the local police present to guide them. It is stipulated that each "Chang" (i.e., Jia) will hold a parents' meeting every five days, and each "Bao" in each district will hold a meeting every ten days. Xiamen's four districts are the first, second, fourth, and fifth districts, and Gulangyu's two districts are the third and sixth districts, apparently to tightly organize themselves. (28th)

### Miscellaneous Notes on Rural Hubei

— Cheng Jun

Echeng's Countryside and the Fankou Dam

Echeng is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, facing Huangzhou across a distance of only a few miles. From the Three Kingdoms, the Jin Dynasty, and even the Southern Dynasties of Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen, it was known as Wuchang County. From the Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties until the early Song Dynasty, it was called Wuchang County. The "eastward looking at Wuchang" mentioned in Su Shi's "Ode to the Red Cliff" refers to this place. It was later renamed Shouchang twice. After the Republic of China, the current name was confirmed. Taking a small boat from Huangzhou and heading east along the river, one can reach it quickly. The scenery there is beautiful, with attractions such as West Mountain, Yanghu Lake, Hydrogen Platform, Dragon Coiling Shoal, and the Wu King Temple. West Mountain is the best, located about a mile from the city and served as the summer retreat for Sun Quan, the Great Emperor of Wu. Comparing the present with the past, one can imagine that in those days, it must have been a gathering place for dignitaries and the center of politics. Halfway up the mountain is the Nine-Bend Pavilion, where Tao Kan studied. Many famous figures throughout the ages have written poems there.

The entire county has over 80,000 households, with farmers estimated to be over 50,000 households. There are over 500,000 mu of arable land. Agricultural products are mainly rice, followed by sweet potatoes, barley, and wheat, and then sorghum, millet, cotton, and hemp, which are also produced in abundance. Special products include lotus roots, tea, and fish. The annual production quantity is 700,000 dan of rice, 90,000 dan of sweet potatoes, 20,000 dan each of wheat, barley, and cotton, 8,000 to 9,000 dan of lotus roots, and 1,000 to 2,000 dan of tea. In recent years, many villages have been ravaged by bandits, and a considerable amount of land has been abandoned, resulting in a significant reduction in production. Not only is there insufficient food for the residents, but they also have to rely on counties like Yangshui for supplies. However, farmers are enthusiastic about growing lotus, and the production of lotus roots has increased dramatically compared to before. Straw paper and firecracker paper are sold to the lower Yangtze region, with an annual value of over 100,000 yuan, which is also an important subsidiary product in the countryside. Land is traditionally measured in "Shi Dou," but now it has been uniformly changed to 60 square "Shi Zhang" as one "Shu." High-quality land yields 3 dan of rice per mu, medium-quality land yields 2 dan, and low-quality land yields 1 dan or less. The value has also fallen from 60 yuan to 6 yuan. The taxes paid are an average burden of 1.8 Jiao per mu for the regular tax, 6 Fen for the surtax, 1.8 Li for the levee tax, and 1.5 Jiao for the mu tax, totaling 4.08 Jiao. This can still be handled in times of good harvests and peaceful conditions, but it is difficult to bear in the event of natural disasters or banditry.

Landowners and tenant farmers are in opposition. Before the Republic of China, landlords treated tenant farmers cruelly, almost as slaves. Tenant farmers also regarded themselves as slaves. Although the status was more equal after the Republic of China, everything was still controlled by the landlords. After the Communist bandits wreaked havoc in 1929, the situation changed drastically, and landlords turned to subservience to tenant farmers. In the past, landlords and tenants split the rent equally, and most tenants had to send grain to the landlord's granary every month. Now, the tenant gets 70% and the landlord gets 30%, and there are still times when rent is resisted. This is because times have changed and the situation has changed.

Farmers are conservative in their habits. Their characteristics include: (1) Emphasizing farming time most, using the calendar as a guide. Slogans such as "when the Gang tree blooms, sow the seeds" are almost household names, and they are followed as if they were golden rules. Old farmers can observe natural phenomena and predict good or bad harvests. (2) Farm tools are clumsy and old-fashioned, and they are not discarded. When new grain appears, it is piled into high mounds and winnowed with wooden shovels against the wind to remove chaff. Sand and stones mix with the grain and cannot be separated. If advised to use a winnowing machine, they laugh and do not answer. (3) Rice seedlings are planted very densely, so they cannot grow fully. Fertilizer is mainly made of feces, and the manure tanks are arranged by the roadside, emitting an odor that is considered very hygienic. (4) After harvesting the rice, it is not immediately stored in the granary, nor is the grain threshed. Instead, it is piled up with the stems and ears still attached, which easily leads to mold. This management method is also outdated. Regarding their common customs, those that deserve attention include: 1. Foot binding. This custom is still prevalent today, and nine out of ten young girls have their feet bound. 2. Litigation. Even for small matters, they must file a lawsuit, often leading to bankruptcy. 3. Clan fights. If litigation is unsuccessful, clan fights ensue. Last year, the Jiang and Hu clans in Yongxiang fought over cutting grass from a stream, and dozens of members of the Hu clan were brutally killed by the Jiang clan. A second clan fight is now brewing, and the government is unable to stop it, only standing by and watching. 4. Performing operas. Operas must be performed for thanksgiving and temple repairs. Scoundrels use this as an excuse for gambling. Temple fairs are also very popular, with each fair costing at least several hundred yuan, or even over a thousand yuan, without hesitation. All of this must be corrected through education. It is also heard that there is an organization called the "Big Sword Society," which engages in murder and robbery, and measures should also be taken to eliminate it.

The county is divided into inner and outer regions. The inner region is mountainous and often suffers from drought. The outer region is a lake district and often suffers from floods. After the Fankou Dam was built, floods were reduced. This dam is a great engineering feat, second only to the Jinshui Dam. The levees are very long, protecting six or seven villages. However, from the perspective of the entire Yangtze River water conservancy, its benefits are small and its harms are great. During the era of Xiao Yaonan's governorship of Hubei in the 11th and 12th years of the Republic of China, there was a so-called "Generals' Group" (a group of generals from Hubei) whose power was enough to influence the political situation. The dam was built on their recommendation. In the past, the main flow of the Yangtze River flowed down along Jiayu. Another tributary flowed through the Xinkou into West Liang Lake, Huangtang Lake, Axe Head Lake, and Liangzi Lake, then through Yar Lake and out to the Yangtze River via Fankou, in order to divert the main flow of the Yangtze River. If the river water was too high, Xinkou could not drain it, and the river water could still backflow from Fankou into Yar Lake, connecting Liangzi, Axe Head, Huangtang, and West Liang Lakes, becoming a natural reservoir. As a result, the Yangtze River floods rarely reached Wuhan, which was fortunate. However, Xiao first allowed General Cai to build a embankment at Xinkou, blocking one of the passages for the river to flow. Later, following the advice of General Wu, the Fankou dam was built, blocking another point for the river to flow in and out. Therefore, in the event of a major flood, the 200-odd li area from Xinkou downstream to Fankou would be in danger, and Wuhan would be the first to bear the brunt. The result of building the dam is that its harm is very great, and its benefit is only that some lakeside land has been silted up to become fertile land, allowing a small number of people to buy it cheaply and reap a rich harvest. The livelihood of the farmers is still not supplemented in any way.

Shenyang correspondence: Japan is now actively expanding its military preparations, so the demand for steel is extremely high. Moreover, the production capacity in the country and colonies such as Korea is very small, so it is investigating relevant resources in the Northeast. It has already discovered high-quality iron ore in Dalizigou in the Eastern Border area, with a yield of 28 million tons, and another 3 million tons in Qidaogou. In addition, coal mines have been discovered near Tonghua, so it has also decided to establish the Tonghua Steel Plant. The Manchuria Railway is currently handling the specifics of this steel plant, and plans to invest 40 million yuan, with the goal of producing 300,000 tons of steel annually.

### Britain and Italy Proceed to Adjust Diplomatic Relations

Chamberlain and Grandi Talk for the First Time, Covering a Wide Range of Topics, Intending to Send Him Home for Consultations

[London] The talks between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Ambassador Grandi are attracting balanced attention from Rome and London. Roman newspapers are quite inclined towards the restoration of relations between Britain and Italy. Italian authorities say that the current European situation is clearer than before. It is generally believed that the talks between Britain and Italy cover a wide range of topics, including the overall situation in Europe, the Spanish question, and Anglo-Italian relations. However, semi-official sources in Rome say that it is not yet possible to be too optimistic, because although the overall situation has become clearer, opposing forces are still at work. Furthermore, the British Cabinet is currently in recess, and the summer resorts of the cabinet members are all in nearby areas, so they can be convened at any time. However, there is currently no intention to convene a cabinet meeting during the holiday. (Central News Agency, 29th, Reuter's Telegram)

[Rome] Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi met with British Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday, and the matter is being given great importance by the general public. It is reported that the content of the talks not only involves various current issues in Europe, but also mentions Anglo-Italian relations. Italian officials recently declared that the international situation has improved greatly on the whole in the past week, and they firmly believe that various differences between major countries can be resolved soon. (Central News Agency, 28th, Havas Telegram)

[London] Parliamentary figures openly declare that Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to his cabinet colleagues at today's regular cabinet meeting on the progress of his talks with Italian Ambassador Grandi yesterday. It is reported that Chamberlain and Grandi mainly discussed the resolution of the Abyssinian question and the maintenance of the status quo in the Mediterranean. Regarding the Abyssinian question, political figures believe that Britain intends to adopt the doubts raised by the Polish government, that is, to advocate that the League of Nations should declare at the annual meeting held in September this year that the Emperor of Abyssinia is no longer able to exercise his powers in fact. From this inference, the representatives sent by the Abyssinian Emperor cannot attend the League of Nations General Assembly. If this situation continues to exist, then Italy's rule over Abyssinia can be recognized in fact. After Prime Minister Chamberlain informed Grandi of this British proposal, Grandi asked his government for instructions before submitting a reply. The future of Anglo-Italian relations is bound to be very important. (Central News Agency, 28th, Havas Telegram)

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain assured Italian Ambassador Grandi that Britain has no intention of aggression against Italy. The content of the talks is kept strictly secret, but the Daily Mail believes that this is Chamberlain's most important diplomatic step, because Chamberlain is quite eager to strengthen Anglo-Italian relations, so he invited the Italian ambassador for talks. The two discussed the European situation in great detail. (28th, National Telegram)

[London] According to this morning's Chronicle, the consultation between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Ambassador Grandi was not initiated by Chamberlain, as generally speculated, but by Grandi. According to the newspaper's correspondent in Rome, Chamberlain asked the Italian ambassador to convey his personal message to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The Italian ambassador is waiting to go to Rome together to report everything immediately. (29th, National Maritime Telegram)

○ Rome: Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi held talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday. It is reported that this is the first step in the mutual approach between Britain and Italy. There are two goals: (1) To revive the Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement; (2) To establish an understanding to support the restoration of the Spanish monarchy, with King Alfonso's third son, Prince Juan, as the monarch. Regarding the first point, the suspicions held by both sides should be eliminated, and France should also have no concerns about its transportation lines in southern and northern Africa. Regarding the second point, Britain previously tried to get closer to Spanish Nationalist leader Franco, which made Italy feel uneasy. The British trade delegation previously demanded that Franco guarantee the interests held by Britain in the southern province of Huelva, which Franco rejected after consulting with the Italian government. When the port of Bilbao fell in June of this year, Britain wanted to restore all its enterprises there, which also made Italy feel uneasy. In addition, Italy is deeply afraid that Spain will become a tool of Britain after the restoration of the monarchy, so it has spared no effort to support those in the Nationalist army who have strong fascist tendencies and oppose the restoration. Up to this point, Italy's attitude has changed greatly. Franco recently issued a declaration supporting Prince Juan's succession to the throne, which was done with the consent of the Italian government. (29th, Havas Telegram)

[London] It is rumored here that Foreign Secretary Eden will travel to Rome to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Informed sources in Britain neither confirm nor deny this. In addition, Italian Ambassador Grandi will return home to report on his duties. Before his departure, he will meet with British Prime Minister Chamberlain again. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas Telegram)

### Germany and Italy Respond to Britain on the Spanish Question

Expressing Acceptance in Principle, But the Soviet Union Remains a Problem

[Rome] Regarding the British government's compromise plan on the non-interference in the Spanish civil war, it is generally believed that Italy can endorse it after it has been distributed to the relevant countries. Responsible persons here also expressed satisfaction with France's acceptance of this plan. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas Telegram)

[London] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has accepted Britain's new non-interference plan for the Spanish conflict, with one reservation, which is roughly related to the withdrawal of volunteers and the recognition of belligerent groups. The Soviet Union's reply is expected to arrive today. (Central News Agency, 29th, Reuter's Telegram)

[Berlin] Germany's reply has been drafted, and it is reported to be of a positive nature. It is now known that it includes acceptance of Britain's proposal. (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuter's Telegram)

[London] The Cabinet held a regular meeting today, and Foreign Secretary Eden will report on the non-interference in the Spanish civil war. The situation before the Coordinating Committee holds a plenary meeting on the 30th of this month will be analyzed. The conclusion is that it is possible for the relevant countries to continue negotiations based on the compromise plan proposed by the British government on the 14th of this month. As for the recognition of the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war as belligerent groups and the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, there are divergent opinions among the representatives of the countries participating in the Coordinating Committee, making it difficult to coordinate. Eden did not shy away from this, but in the future, it may be possible to first determine the ratio of the number of volunteers withdrawn by the two sides in the Spanish civil war, and then immediately recognize the two sides in the civil war as belligerent groups. According to this method, it may be possible for the relevant countries to reach a compromise. Finally, the cabinet meeting also decided in principle that if the compromise plan proposed by Britain on the 14th of this month cannot become the basis for a compromise, then the British government will adopt the following policies: (1) continue to implement the non-interference method and maintain the surveillance system on the Spanish sea and land borders; (2) not withdraw volunteers; (3) not recognize the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war as belligerent groups.

### The Spanish Restoration Problem

Prince Juan is Expected to Succeed

[Paris] Those familiar with the Spanish question here recently declared that after the reconciliation between the deposed King Alfonso XIII of Spain and the deposed Queen, the succession of Prince Juan, the third son of the King, to the throne has become increasingly promising. The deposed King and Queen have reached a tacit agreement with the Spanish Nationalist authorities that after General Franco wins a great victory, Alfonso will immediately ascend to the throne again and then abdicate to Prince Juan. It is reported that the moderate faction of the Carlist party, led by Count Guizancourt, has also expressed its support for this plan. Prince Xavier, the heir to the throne supported by the extremist faction of the party, is also willing to replace himself with Prince Juan. Prince Juan studied at the Royal Military College in Woolwich, England, and has always been supported by the British government and the public. If he succeeds to the Spanish throne, he will be able to obtain financial assistance from Britain in the future for postwar reconstruction. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas Telegram)

### The Young Ruler of Egypt Holds a Coronation Ceremony

Two Million Spectators Attended

Cairo: Farouk, the first independent monarch of Egypt in four centuries, held his coronation ceremony today at the age of eight. The public crowded into the city, and two million people attended the ceremony. Thousands of them entered the city last night and lay on the streets to wait for dawn. (28th, National Telegram)

Cairo: Prince Farouk VIII of Egypt held his enthronement ceremony today. The grandeur of the ceremony was unprecedented in recent times. Due to the limitations of Islamic law, Farouk could not hold a coronation ceremony, but only took the oath of the constitution in the two houses of parliament. The new king is very young, and today he wore the uniform of an army general and sat on a gold-plated throne surrounded by brilliant tents. Prime Minister Nahas and the Speaker of the Senate gave brief eulogies, and Farouk swore to respect the constitution and uphold the independence of the country. He then took the throne at the Al-Azhar Mosque, and the ceremony was roughly equivalent to the coronation of the British King. The elderly, white-haired president of Al-Azhar University conferred the throne on the King, and all the ceremonies followed religious rituals. The questions and answers were all stipulated in the Holy Quran. It is said that the new King Farouk received a very Westernized education in his childhood and can speak fluent English and French.

### The British King and Queen Arrive in Scotland

Stornoway, Scotland: King George VI and the Queen of Britain arrived here today on the royal yacht "Victoria." The public warmly welcomed them. (29th, National Telegram)

Belfast, Northern Ireland: As the British King and Queen passed through a pile of rafts here yesterday for one hour, an explosion suddenly occurred. The authorities today believe that this was a landmine explosion, not a gas explosion. Fragments from the explosion were scattered about 30 yards away. Hundreds of police officers escorted the British King and Queen at this time, planes soared in the sky, and 5,000 police officers patrolled the streets. However, rural police and extremists exchanged fire, and several unknown people attempted to blow up the railway bridge to prevent the Ulster police from going to between Larne and Dumbarton. Twenty-eight customs houses have been burned, and the railway bridge between Dingwall and Forres has also been blown up. On the surface, this action is not directly against the royal family, but it is obviously intended to prevent the people of Ireland from going to welcome them. (29th, National Telegram)

### Details of the Discovery of Japanese Sailor Miyazaki in Jingjiang

County Government Questioned and Sent Documents to Provincial Government

Jingjiang Correspondence: The Shanghai Japanese sailor Miyazaki, who was reported missing some time ago, was found on the surface of the river in Jingjiang County on the 27th. The detailed circumstances of the discovery are as follows:

Around 10 AM on the 27th of this month, a sailboat was sailing from Jiangyin towards Jingjiang. When it reached the vicinity of Jiuwei Port in Jingjiang, the boatman saw something floating on the water surface, not knowing what it was. He quickly hauled it onto the boat, and it turned out to be a naked man, mentally alert, with a piece of cloth on his head. He was immediately sent to the Fourth Branch of the Bawei Port Police Station under Jingjiang, where Patrol Officer Zhang Lifeng and others repeatedly questioned him. Due to the language barrier, they couldn't understand each other. However, observing his expression and demeanor, he did not seem to be Chinese, so they suspected he was a traitor. They immediately sent someone to report to the county government. Su Min, the magistrate of Jingjiang County, upon learning this, immediately dispatched Police Chief Li Zhibin, along with Special Agent Dai Hanbin, to the police station. At 2 PM that afternoon, they escorted the man to the county government and brought him into the reception room. They first provided him with tea and snacks, and then Su, along with Secretary Zhang Jiangong and Section Chief Chen Zhijie of the county government, came out to meet him. They saw that he was wearing a white short-sleeved undershirt, gray cloth shorts, and black running shoes (the clothes and shoes were provided at the Bawei Port Police Station). His skin was dark, and it was immediately apparent that he was accustomed to being in the water. They repeatedly questioned him in Chinese, but he did not respond, staring blankly. They then switched to written Japanese. According to the man, he was Japanese, named Kiyoshi Hinoki, and worked at the Matsuki Trading Company on Wusong Road in Shanghai. He claimed to have fallen into the river accidentally. When asked about his movements and work, he did not answer. Upon further examination, the cloth was also very suspicious. The cloth was self-colored, thin and sparse, about two feet long and one foot wide. The surface of the cloth was covered with red circular prints, about two inches in diameter. Two short red threads were passed through the center of each red circular print from the underside of the cloth to the top, tied in a tight knot, leaving about one inch of red thread remaining. The cloth surface was almost entirely covered, suggesting that it was intentionally woven by someone. In the lower right corner of the cloth were the two characters "Kawakami." In the center of the cloth was another strip of white cloth, about half an inch wide and five inches long, with the five characters "Mr. Sadao Miyazaki" written on it. At that time, County Magistrate Su Min and the other people involved in the conversation repeatedly interrogated him strictly, but he did not reveal the truth, as if he had something difficult to say. After the interrogation was completed, he was provided with tea, cigarettes, and food. At 6 PM that afternoon, the county government prepared a document along with a record of the written conversation and a piece of wrapped cloth, and selected Patrol Officer Zhi Huai and Special Agent Dai Hanbin of the police bureau to escort him properly through Wuxi to the Zhenjiang Provincial Government.

### Preparations of Japanese Residents in Qingdao for Wartime

3,000 Japanese Residents Receive Military Training; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Arrive in Qingdao from Japan

Qingdao Correspondence: Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, there has been concern that various coastal areas of China may be attacked by the enemy, especially Qingdao, which is secretly connected to the enemy. Therefore, rumors have repeatedly spread in Qingdao, causing panic among the people. Many wealthy merchants and people with property who were in Qingdao to escape the summer heat have left Qingdao one after another. As a result, in the past ten days, the passenger trains on the Jiaoji Railway and the ships to Shanghai have been extremely crowded. After the city authorities made efforts to maintain local security, the city remained peaceful, and businesses continued to operate as usual. However, on the Japanese side, in addition to the gradual withdrawal of Japanese and Korean residents along the Jiaoji Railway line to Qingdao, the Japanese residents in Qingdao are making various wartime preparations. It is said that the Japanese volunteer army in Qingdao numbers over 3,000 and has long been trained according to military organization. Recently, large quantities of military supplies have been transported from Moji and Dalian in Japan. The unloading was done very secretly, so few outsiders know about it. It is said that the Japanese plan to use the Japanese Shrine on Liaoning Road as their headquarters, while the various yarn factories operated by the Japanese in the Sifang and Cangku areas will be used to store military supplies. Japanese women are also organized systematically to serve as nurses in rear hospitals. Recently, the Japanese Residents' Association held a National Defense Women's Advancement Association meeting to actively prepare everything. The Japanese consulate dispatched special agents in cars to distribute leaflets, telling Japanese residents that in case of an emergency, they should seek refuge in the following designated shelters: the Residents' Association, the First Japanese Elementary School, the Women's Hospital, the Naval Assembly Hall, and the Sifang Japanese Yarn Factory. There are currently five Japanese warships docked here, and no incidents have occurred yet. However, given the various preparations made by the Japanese, it is feared that war may be inevitable. It is said that our authorities have made considerable preparations and will launch a strong attack if the enemy lands here and launches a large-scale invasion.

Cloth Factories Will Be Forced to Shut Down

The cloth factory industry here made profits last autumn because yarn prices once soared and there were large stocks of goods. Unexpectedly, this year, the sales of factory cloth have been greatly affected due to the flooding of foreign cloth, and sales have been sluggish. Recently, war has broken out again, sources are scarce, and prices have also increased. According to the cloth merchants here, the money the factories have now for yarn is only enough for half a month's use. If the source is still cut off by then, then the factories will all be forced to shut down. If that happens, then thousands of men and women workers in this area will all be unemployed.

He came to Wuxi to conduct investigative work, and he confessed that there were more than 40 accomplices, two of whom were staying at the Hui Hostel outside the West Gate, all with Chinese maps and other items. After verifying the confession, the police chief determined that Li Axing was indeed suspected of being a traitor. On the 29th, he was transferred to the general bureau for interrogation.

### Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke Discusses Revolution and Resistance

The Enemy Will Never Allow Us to Resist Calmly; We Must Respond with Total Resistance

Amid the sudden changes in the situation in North China, a reporter from the New Voice Society visited Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke at his private residence on Columbia Road yesterday morning. Sun generously discussed the key to resistance in North China and the only way out today, which is total resistance, as well as diplomatic strategies and the promotion of popular sentiment. He was very excited during the conversation. Here is a record of his conversation:

North China is in Danger and Must Be Defended Firmly

Sun first said that after the Japanese army invaded North China, occupying our transportation hubs and strategic military locations, their determination to obtain them was absolute. Therefore, they repeatedly fought and made peace to increase their strength. Two weeks ago, I sent a telegram to Song Zheyuan, commander of the 29th Army, explaining the necessity of resisting early to avoid Tianjin falling into danger. Now that Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Feng Zhi'an, and others have left Peiping for Baoding, it can be seen that Peiping is an isolated city and is in great danger. The only hope today is that the 29th Army can firmly defend Peiping and Tianjin to wait for reinforcements to arrive and launch a counterattack to restore the integrity of North China's territory and sovereignty.

Do Not Be Deceived by the Enemy's Conspiracy

We must know that Japan has no intention of waging a full-scale war against China. Their strategy is to divide China and gradually annex it. Today, they claim to deal with the 29th Army, first controlling Peiping and Tianjin. After achieving their goal, they will annex the entire Hebei and Chahar provinces. After Hebei and Chahar are in their hands, they will inevitably demand Shandong and Shanxi provinces, followed by Henan and then the Longhai Railway, encompassing the Central Plains and the Northwest, and eventually reaching the Yangtze River basin. They will gradually occupy it under the pretext of dealing with a certain person, a certain army, or a certain regime, rather than waging war with the entire China. But we must not be deceived by the enemy's propaganda and believe that today's war is a war between the Japanese garrison and the 29th Army. We must regard China as a whole, and the Chinese army as a whole. No matter where the invasion occurs, we must go all out. Japan is carrying out its conspiracy of divide and conquer, and we must respond with total resistance. Only in this way can there be any hope of peace. Otherwise, the enemy will advance step by step, and we will retreat step by step. What is the difference between leading the whole country to surrender to the enemy?

Revolutionary Warfare Is the Only Way to Deal With It

Some people think that China's preparations today are not sufficient and that it cannot immediately rise up to resist. This argument is actually specious. First, today's events are not that we are seeking war, but that the enemy is forcing us to fight. If we surrender again, it is tantamount to surrendering. After surrendering, what preparations can we talk about? Second, we prepare, and the enemy prepares, and there will never be a day when we are on equal footing. Moreover, the enemy will not allow us to prepare calmly. Third, the Sino-Japanese War is not comparable to a war between strong countries, because in a war between strong countries, the military strength of both sides is equal, and victory can be determined on the border front. Our country is different. The battlefield is within our country. We can only deal with it with revolutionary warfare, that is, all the people of the country participate in the war anytime and anywhere. With China's vastness and its large population, how much military force does Japan have to conquer China? If the war is prolonged, Japan will naturally only fail. Some people also think that China's economic center is in the coastal areas, and if a war starts, the losses will be too great, so we must prepare first. This is also specious, because we must clearly recognize that the purpose of resistance is to seek national survival, and of course we cannot avoid sacrifices. If we are afraid of making sacrifices, then any preparation is useless. Moving the economic center to the interior cannot be done in a short time. However, the enemy is pressing hard, so how can we allow ourselves to prepare for ten or twenty years?

British and American Assistance Is Difficult in Reality

Sun then talked about China's diplomatic strategy, saying that France, as a victorious country after the European War, is still trying hard to find friends. China is a weak country, so of course it needs friends even more. It must not isolate itself and refrain from seeking allies for fear of offending the enemy. The three major powers related to the Far East political situation are Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Britain and the United States are naval powers, and although they have interests in the Far East, they will never use their naval power to participate in land wars and assist China. Therefore, the only friend China can find is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is the only major power in the Far East and is a land power. If China and the Soviet Union have a mutual assistance pact or something similar, Japan may not dare to start a war lightly. The reason why Japan is so eager to invade North China now is to strike first.

Promote Popular Sentiment and Deal With It Calmly

Finally, Sun said that the situation in North China has reached a critical point today. The people of the whole country should trust the government and deal with it calmly, but we must enable the national sentiment of resisting the enemy to be fully developed, so that national strength is solid and consolidated, and we can win the final victory. Sun severely criticized the errors in the current peace negotiations in the speeches of the Shanghai newspapers, believing that they were very appropriate and that this kind of speech was deeply in line with the main purpose of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Lushan talks.

### Regulations for Soliciting National Salvation Donations Established by the Local Anti-Enemy Support Association

Various Groups Respond to Solicit Funds to Relieve the Wounded and the Dead; Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Cut Back on Food and First Remit 4,000

The Shanghai Municipal Anti-Enemy Support Association, as the prelude to the Anti-Japanese War in North China has begun and large amounts of funds are needed, has specially launched a solicitation of national salvation donations. Its declaration has been published in various newspapers and will not be recorded here again. The regulations for soliciting national salvation donations are extracted below:

Regulations for Soliciting Donations

(1) The purpose of this association is to raise donations, contribute to the country, and provide for the needs of resisting the enemy and saving the country. (2) This association entrusts banks, money shops, and other receiving agencies to receive donations. This association does not receive cash. (3) The donations raised will be announced separately by this association. (4) All donations will be submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for unified distribution, but donors and this association may contribute opinions on the use of the funds. The office expenses of this association will be raised separately.

Those who donate 5,000 yuan or more will be presented to the National Government by this association for a certificate of commendation or honorary award.

Charitable Groups Rush to Remit 5,000

The Shanghai Charity Groups Joint Disaster Relief Association recently received a telegram from Yang Zigong, the Relief Commissioner, from Peiping, reporting that in Fengtai, Langfang, Tongxian, Nanyuan, Lugouqiao, Pingjiao, and other places, due to the brave resistance of our army against the enemy, many compatriots in the war zone were killed and injured under the bombing of enemy planes and artillery, and the losses were also considerable, which is still under investigation. However, the wounded and the dead compatriots urgently need to be rescued. After receiving the telegram, the association immediately rushed to remit 5,000 yuan to rescue the wounded and the dead first, and telegraphed Yang Zigong to actively handle the refugee camps in the war zone to prevent refugees from being displaced. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to all circles in this city, asking them to donate enthusiastically, and it was learned that the association is now jointly working with the Red Cross and other rescue groups to prepare for on-site rescue and training work, and to enrich the necessary rescue equipment, as well as anti-poison and fire fighting matters, to assist relevant groups in dealing with disasters.

Hardware Industry Donates 2,000

The Shanghai Hardware Parts Industry Association held a temporary emergency joint meeting of all executive and supervisory committees yesterday morning, with more than 40 people including Xu Menghua and Wang Yunzhang attending. First, Chairman Yu Wenyong reported on the recent situation of the North China Incident and the process of participating in the Shanghai All Sectors Anti-Enemy Support Association. Then, it was unanimously approved: (1) To launch a fundraising campaign of 2,000 yuan for national salvation donations. About 700 or 800 yuan were recognized on the spot by various committee members, and the remaining amount must be raised within three days. If the amount is still not raised within the deadline, then the shortfall will be made up by the various executive and supervisory committee members. (2) To appoint 31 people, including Yu Wenyong, Xu Menghua, and Wang Yunzhang, as fundraising committee members. (3) To hold the first fundraising committee meeting on August 1 to discuss long-term fundraising matters. Finally, detailed methods were discussed on preventing various industry colleagues from transporting hardware parts and other items to the enemy, and restricting exports.

### Only Cannons and Bombs Can Secure Justice

*The North China Daily News* Laments the North China War; Global Public Opinion Unanimously Supports China

The *North China Daily News* published an editorial yesterday titled "War Without Declaration," stating: Tokyo has formally announced that Japan intends to dispatch troops to "suppress" China. The Central Government of China has confirmed its support for Song Zheyuan as the commander of the garrison in Hebei. Just as it consented to Song's approval of the on-the-spot resolution with [General] Kasai in its last-minute efforts to seek peace, Japanese aircraft suddenly bombarded [Wan]Ping on July 25th. The Chinese government therefore believed it could not accept the suggestions in Kasai's final ultimatum. Thus, Song, in the name of the government, rejected this proposal, and then took military action. Then came reports of the Chinese army retaking Langfang and Fengtai. The Baoding army also marched north under the Central Government's orders, under Song's command, to resist the Japanese army's movements. Judging from the events that have unfolded in the past few days, it can be said that the Chinese and Japanese armies have now begun a war in North China. However, if the words of both sides can be considered truthful, then the actions taken by both sides can be expected to avoid a formal declaration of war, even if diplomatic relations are officially severed. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe stated in parliament that Japan's "suppression" is not intended to occupy Chinese territory but only to force China to cooperate and contribute to the development of Eastern culture. His meaning seems to be that China has failed to fulfill certain agreements, and its negligence should be corrected so that Japan's plan to prevent communism from spreading from Outer Mongolia and stabilize the overall situation can be solidified. It also seems that the heavy responsibility for the needs of Eastern culture has now been borne by the Japanese expeditionary force, which has to reluctantly encourage the cooperation of the Chinese to turn the right wing of the Mongol-Russian invasion threat. Konoe did not inform the parliament how this could be achieved without occupying Chinese land and stationing troops in the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces, except for this secret method of refusing the Eastern cultural doctrine. The Chinese government's declaration of its aims seems plain and simple. That the Chinese army dares to act within its own borders and the Japanese army travels freely everywhere, who is right and who is wrong, makes people confused and unable to distinguish. Moreover, the Japanese army is not occupying Hebei and relies on a simple protocol and a broad interpretation of a mysterious agreement, its actions are not subject to any visible restrictions. The Chinese government's announcement only states that it cannot recognize unreasonable demands and must strive to defend its own land. Tokyo must regard this kind of uncooperative action to spread the benefits of Eastern culture as another evidence of China's "lack of sincerity," although the consequences are deeply regrettable. Elsewhere, everyone knows the Japanese intentions.

The Chinese government now attributes full responsibility for this war to Japan. World opinion will surely agree. If the Japanese do not realize this, they are truly deceiving themselves. Without a doubt, the Japanese are not aware and only wear a mask of patriotic enthusiasm to gain the praise of their own people and comfort themselves, disregarding world opinion. This battle is extremely unequal. This can be judged without detailed examination of the war machinery. The Chinese government has made every effort to restrain itself, even at the cost of compromise and forbearance, to avoid the final conflict, which is a remarkable insight into its own situation. Although temporarily excited about the initial victories that have been rumored, far-sighted Chinese, or their government, must resist the premeditated provocations that are forced upon them by the imagination of the new era. As President Chiang Kai-shek himself said, "If it comes to the final moment, we will only risk the lives of the entire nation to seek the survival of the country." They will not be ignorant. They must finally use the only standard, that is, the standard by which this kind of arrogant new world can truly judge the integrity and completeness of nations. In today's world, only where cannons and bombs can help is there still justice to be found. Anyone who is weak and can be safely trampled on by everyone can be accused at any time. Self-defense is indeed the only way to correct this. China seems to have decided to implement this path today.

### Various Organizations and Agencies Advise Citizens to Remain Calm

The Chinese people should exhaust their energy, physical strength, material resources, and financial resources. The war will be protracted, not just a matter of one day, one place, or one corner.

Since reading the newspapers' reports of Mayor Yu and Bureau Chief Pan's messages to the public, and the police bureau's spokesman's statements, the citizens of this city have shown a calm attitude. However, there are still many people moving out of the Zhabei area. However, in the rear, the most important thing is to remain calm. Various important organizations and agencies have also successively issued articles advising citizens to remain calm. Excerpts are as follows:

Anti-Enemy Support Association

The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association's message to compatriots across the country states:

Compatriots across the country,

The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, on behalf of all public groups in the city, respectfully offers our most sincere greetings to compatriots across the country at this time of strong enemies, unified resistance, survival, and initial victories on the front lines, saying:

Japan seized Mukden on September 18th, and it will soon be six years since then. In these six years, it has unleashed its ferocious flames, swallowing our Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe provinces, nibbling away at northern Chahar, enslaving eastern Hebei, disturbing our Shanghai, and coveting Suiyuan. Four million square miles have fallen into its grasp, and thirty million people have suffered trampling. This is truly an irreconcilable feud. Only because our people love peace and have been patient and tolerant in many ways, hoping to preserve the remnant and defend the essentials, first prioritizing the consolidation of the country. Who knew that the wolf's ambition was insatiable, rampant in North China, coveting peace? On the 8th of this month, the Lugou Bridge incident was initiated, and Wanping County was attacked and plundered. Its declaration not to expand was issued in Tokyo, but the Kwantung Army's reinforcements entered Jianguan in the evening. It ignored our diplomatic resolution proposals, made fraudulent overtures to our local officials, forced our army to comply with the agreement to change defenses, and then attacked our unprepared forces, seizing Langfang Station and attacking Zhangyimen. First, it used an ultimatum to interfere with our military's garrison, and then it used an ultimatum to force us to surrender Pingjin with folded hands. As the date for the reply approached, the troops besieging the four suburbs of Beiping gathered. All these acts of aggression are in our eyes and hearts. Observing their goals of aggression, they only want our country to be destroyed and our people to be exterminated. Alas, compatriots across the country, with our historical mission, how can we allow territorial concessions and seek peace? Moreover, with their wild ambitions, how can we avoid destruction by seeking peace? Forced to this point, we can only respond with war.

Our country has endured humiliation and borne insult for six years, and full-scale war has only begun today. All our compatriots must be shocked by the imminent danger. We must only devote ourselves to difficulty, encourage each other with one heart and one mind, and look forward to overcoming difficulties and preserving the nation. However, from today until the repelling of the enemy, it will inevitably take several years in time and undergo great hardship in space. It is not a matter of a moment, nor is it a matter of child's play. We firmly believe that everyone has a heart to serve the country, and their hearts are unanimous. We must especially know that everyone has a way to serve the country, and there is more than one way. Then, under the common goal of saving the country and preserving its existence, how should compatriots across the country unify their will and actions, and exhaust their abilities? This is what must be recognized at the beginning of this war.

Japan's strategy is to win without fighting. Therefore, over the years, it has used much false声 intimidation and巧取豪奪. Now it is trying to defeat us individually, so over the years, it has created disturbances and solved problems locally. Now that we have seen through its conspiracy, we must unite all levels of society, from the central government to the people, horizontally unite all provinces, circles, and industries across the country, and become an unbreakable whole. Under the government's organization and the leaders' leadership, we must not regard military orders, political orders, and all laws as mere formalities, we must not perfunctorily evade them, we must not hesitate, we must not complain, but we must devote our loyalty and intelligence to them in order to maintain an orderly pace and unleash our collective strength. This is the first thing that must be recognized.

The enemy army is in the north, and our country is fighting in the north. However, the victory or defeat in the north is related to the safety and well-being of the whole country. Therefore, people across the country must not treat the war in the north as if they are watching a fire from across the river, but must support it with all their strength. If Japan realizes that it is impossible to win without fighting and that the expansion of the war is not in its interest, and repents and withdraws its troops, it will be beneficial to both sides. However, the matter lies with them, not with us, and we cannot expect it. As the situation evolves to this day, our country must estimate the capabilities of its naval and air forces to launch attacks on our east, south, and north sides. Therefore, when supporting the north, people across the country must simultaneously prepare for the entire country to be invaded, prepare for the entire country to become a war zone, and prepare for the entire country to fight armed. Under the attack, in the war zone, during the war, prepare for endless losses, prepare for endless suffering. Place lives and property aside. Then, what cannot be done with loss and suffering? But as long as we have the determination to fight a long-term war, it is absolutely impossible for them to destroy or annihilate us. This is inevitable and also the inevitable reason. This is the second thing that must be recognized.

The gains and losses of war are determined by the final victory. Since the people of the country must endure countless losses and sufferings until the final victory, they must also understand that between the start of the war and before the victory, local victories, defeats, advances, and retreats are common occurrences in military affairs. Do not be discouraged by occasional defeats or retreats, and do not be arrogant and slack due to occasional victories or advances. Today, the initial victories in Fengtai and Langfang, the news of victory, and the sound of firecrackers shaking the sky show the people's love for the country, and it is also because of the long-term suppression that human feelings cannot be tolerated. However, from now on, we must encourage each other with calmness, reduce expenditure to meet the needs of national defense, and do not worry about temporary advances and retreats, but strive to achieve the final victory. The day when the final victory is achieved, rejoicing is permissible, and it must also have its day. This is the third thing that must be recognized.

What is the final victory? It does not lie in the advance or retreat of the army, nor in the breadth of the militarily occupied territory, nor in the number of casualties in the army. As far as our country is concerned, if the people cannot bear the losses and sufferings and no longer fight, it is a defeat, and it is the enemy's victory. As far as Japan is concerned, if it can no longer continue to attack and gives up its aggression, it is a defeat, and it is our country's victory. To put it simply, if our country is afraid to fight, it is a sign of defeat. If our country fights hard, then no matter whether the war is on the coast, on the Yangtze River, or in the interior, our country is on the way to victory. In the past, Napoleon's expedition to Russia had already captured Moscow, but the loser was Napoleon, not Russia. At the end of the European War, the German army occupied the northeastern half of France, but the loser was Germany, not France. The final victory should be viewed in this way. This is the fourth thing that must be recognized.

Today is only the beginning of the war. The final victory is in the distant future. The urgent task of the people of the country today, in addition to the direct combat on the front lines, is to exert their energy and physical strength, and exhaust their material and financial resources, to contribute to the country. The way to contribute is: first, to be extremely thrifty, that is, to prevent any slightest waste of all forces, saving a trace is to save a huge amount for the country; second, to strive for production, that is, to make all forces grow, and whatever grows is to increase the country by a certain amount; third, to accept control, that is, all forces, whether saved by thrift or accumulated by full production, are subject to the country's allocation and use in the war. One's time and spirit are like this, one's body and flesh are like this, and all one's belongings are even more like this. This is the wartime national

He will then rush to the front line to assist Chairman Song in planning military operations against the enemy.

### Kawagoe Did Not Make the Trip Yesterday, and Will Return to Japan Within Days

Tajiri Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Shigeru Kawagoe, the Japanese Ambassador to China, left Shanghai on the 8th of this month and went north to Tianjin to meet with Jian Katatsuki, the commander of the garrison army visiting the delegation, two weeks ago. According to news from the Japanese Embassy, ​​Kawagoe was again ordered by the Foreign Ministry of his country to return south by plane of the China Aviation Corporation yesterday morning, and transferred to the Qingdao Maru of the Dalian Kisen Kaisha to Shanghai via Qingdao, but due to the fierce fighting in Tianjin yesterday, traffic was cut off, so the trip did not happen. However, it is determined that he will try to leave Tianjin within days.

In addition, Aiyi Tajiri, the intelligence chief of the Japanese Embassy and consul in Shanghai, returned to Shanghai after meeting with Kawagoe in Tianjin a few days ago, and was ordered to go to Beijing to convey everything to Noburo Hidaka, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy and consul-general in Beijing. He had returned to Shanghai by car at 7 a.m. yesterday and met with Kihei Okamoto, the counselor of the embassy and consul-general in Shanghai, to report on the general situation of China in Beijing and the process of Hidaka's meetings with our diplomatic authorities.

### Municipal Association Asks to Pay Attention to the Safety of Residents in the Concession

Do Not Allow Japanese Soldiers to Commit Illegal Acts

The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai sent a letter to the工部局 yesterday, saying: We are writing to you regarding a letter from the Chinese Youth Discussion Association on July 25th, which reported that Japanese soldiers, under the pretext of a missing soldier, mobilized their battalion of soldiers to arbitrarily inspect and arrest pedestrians in the Hongkou District last night. We are shocked to learn that hundreds of thousands of tax-paying citizens residing in the concession are subject to the arbitrary tyranny of Japanese soldiers. Our taxpayers pay huge amounts of taxes to the工部局 every year, and the bureau should not abandon the security of the Hongkou District, causing Japanese soldiers to run amok and commit illegal acts. Therefore, we are writing to your association to request that you raise a serious question with the工部局 to ensure the safety of tax-paying citizens. Your bureau has the responsibility to protect the lives and safety of citizens in the concession. How can you allow Japanese soldiers to commit such illegal acts? Even if the matter arises suddenly, your bureau should immediately stop it, so as not to betray the trust of the residents of the concession. We are writing to inform you of the situation and hope you will pay attention to it.

### Jianghai Customs Prevents the Export of Fluorspar

Mainland Ships Transport Contraband, Navigation Bureau Refuses to Clear Customs

The Datong Shipping Company of Japan has recently leased the Mainland Ship from the Mainland Industrial Shareholding Company of Shanghai to transport goods with a load of 3,400 tons, sailing between China and Japan. The town is transported by Japanese merchants in China to transport fluorspar (a type of ore) to the East. After checking, this cargo is the raw material for building airplanes and is prohibited from being exported. Yesterday, the ship reported for export to Japan, but was found by Jianghai Customs and was not allowed to be shipped out according to regulations. The Shanghai Navigation Bureau refused to clear the ship yesterday, so it could not leave. It is heard that the Japanese side is still trying to find ways to ship it out, but the Navigation Bureau insists on not allowing it to clear customs.

### Rogue Zhong Lianxiao Was Killed by His Enemy

Uneven Distribution of Loot Leads to Grudges, Killed Outside the Night Before

Zhong Lianxiao, a rogue from Ningbo, is thirty-three years old this year. He had an affair with a local woman surnamed Zhang (the same age as Zhong) and lived together in the building above the street in Baoyu Lane, No. 21 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession. Zhang works as a hostess in the rooftop garden game room of the Xinxin Company on Nanjing Road, while Zhong also contracts the open-air movie theater tea house in the game room. Although Zhong has a job, he is still a rogue at heart. Every day, he and his gang spend their days haggling and scheming for people in the Fresh Happy Residence teahouse at the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street on the French Dada Road. This time, four days ago, he made 30 yuan for haggling for someone, but Zhong swallowed 5 yuan and only handed over 25 yuan to be distributed among his companions. However, the gang members saw Zhong's domineering nature and hated him to the bone. This dispute was over the 30 yuan and 25 yuan. A certain Zhang in the gang was very unhappy, which led to a dispute. Zhong's mistress, Zhang, even slapped Zhang in the face, and the other party threatened to kill Zhong. At about 8 p.m. on the 29th, Zhong went to Fuxing Lane on East Zilaihuo Street after dinner at home to talk to a woman about haggling. Unexpectedly, Zhong was walking alone near No. 21 Fuxing Lane on East Zilaihuo Street when he was suddenly caught up by his enemy from behind, who took out a sharp blade and stabbed Zhong in his left and right flanks and back three times in total. Zhong was injured and bled profusely, falling to the ground in a pool of blood, shouting for help. Because the place was quiet, the murderer, having achieved his goal, fled. Nearby residents heard the sound and rushed to check, recognizing Zhong. They immediately notified his mistress, Zhang, to come. Zhong's wounds were very deep, and his stomach was broken, causing rice grains to flow out. He was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. The murderer had fled far away and could not be arrested. Zhong died of his injuries at 4:30 a.m. yesterday. The French police took the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Auxiliary Fourth Branch and reported to Judge Wang Ren of the First Special Court, who, together with the forensic doctor, came to the office at noon to verify that the deceased Zhong Suxiao had indeed died of knife wounds. He ordered the body to be handed over to his family for burial, and the police were instructed to arrest the murderer for investigation. An hour before the autopsy, three of the deceased's gang members, Xiao Fugen, Xiao Genfu, etc., went to the autopsy room to visit. Detective Wang Dongwan found them suspicious and, because they were selling morphine, issued an arrest warrant and took them to the police station for interrogation. A certain coal shop owner in Caishi Street was also arrested for suspicion and taken to the police station for investigation, but was later released on bail. The police are said to have obtained clues and sent detectives to investigate and arrest the murderer for legal action.

### Municipal Government Promotes Domestic Materials

Directing Subordinates to Comply, Handling in Accordance with Central Opinions

The Municipal Government yesterday directed its subordinates to promote domestic materials, in order to implement the instructions of the Executive Yuan and the joint opinions of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways on promoting domestic materials, which included three items: ㊀ Regarding building materials that have not yet been manufactured in the country, government agencies with attached factories should try to manufacture them themselves within the scope of their equipment. Provincial and municipal governments should also establish industrial testing institutes to handle material improvement matters. ㊁ Regarding the search for domestic materials to replace foreign goods, the Ministry of Industry has ordered the Central Industrial Testing Institute under its jurisdiction to start research with its existing equipment. Other academic institutions can also conduct research and trial manufacturing with their existing equipment. ㊂ Regarding domestic forest materials that have been proven to be slightly better than similar foreign materials but are slightly more expensive, government agencies should be allowed to use domestic products at a slightly higher price. The Ministry of Industry has compiled a list of wood, minerals, and general industries since October last year, and has also compiled a list of domestic goods and formulated measures for government agencies to purchase domestic goods for reference and adoption by various agencies. Special instructions were issued to encourage procurement.

### Vegetable Vendors in the City Again Request a Postponement of the Merger

The Deadline Set by the Police and Finance Bureaus Has Expired, but the Vegetable Vendors Have Not Yet Registered

The incident of vegetable stalls on Fuyou Road in the city being repeatedly driven away by the Yimiao Bureau and vegetable vendors being beaten and injured has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that since the Police and Finance Bureaus issued a joint announcement ordering all vegetable vendors to register at the Municipal South Tax Collection Office of the Finance Bureau before the 30th of this month, and to draw lots at the Yimiao Police Station on the 1st of next month (August) to move in order to the vegetable market on Fujia Street on the left side of the county and operate under license, the deadline has now arrived (the 30th), and none of the 129 vegetable vendors on Fuyou Road have registered at the tax collection office. All the vegetable vendors have now followed the resolution and submitted a petition to the Municipal Government and the Police and Finance Bureaus, requesting that the order be revoked and the status quo be temporarily maintained. The vegetable vendors on the left side of the county are now refusing to allow the vegetable stalls on Fuyou Road to move in. Yesterday, more than 20 shops on Fuyou Road, such as Tongyuan Sauce Group, Fengyu, Ruifeng Rice Store, Yida Candle Store, Yuanyuan Tobacco Paper Store, Mingde Coal Store, Nanshan Hall Pharmacy, and Zhenxing Meat Store, submitted a joint petition to the Municipal Government and the Police and Finance Bureaus, stating that since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the commercial situation has plummeted. Fortunately, there is a vegetable market on Fuyou Road, and the business is still viable. If the vegetable stalls are moved elsewhere, the shops will inevitably have to close down. Therefore, they have jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Government and the Police and Finance Bureaus, requesting that the relocation be waived in order to maintain the market.

### A Policeman Impersonates a Police Chief to Privately Summon Merchants and is Cursed

After Verification, He Is Sent to the Bureau for Review

Fu Huaichen, the factory director of the Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap and Medicine Factory on Jinyi Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai, was told by a policeman from the local police station yesterday morning that he had been ordered by the police chief to come and talk. He was tricked into going to the station, where the policeman slapped him in public, cursed him, and drove him out. The cause of the incident was that some workers at the factory had a fight around 6 a.m. a few days ago, but the police could not be found. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the station chief. After investigation, it was found that the policeman was on duty at the time. In addition to being reprimanded, he was also given a major demerit, so he held a grudge. Recently, because the policeman was extorting bribes from Hakka delivery trucks while on duty, he was stopped by the factory director, which made him even more resentful and wanted revenge. It is now learned that the factory director has reported the incident to the station chief. After receiving the report, the station believed that the policeman had impersonated the police chief and privately summoned merchants, which affected police administration, so he summoned the policeman to the station, detained him, and sent him to the bureau for review.

### Wang Xinggao Is Ordered to Surrender by His Guarantor

In the case of the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, Wang Xinggao, a suspect from Funing who was accused of instigating the crime, was arrested by the French police and sentenced to life imprisonment in the first instance by the Second Special Court. After appealing to the Third Branch of the High Court, the original sentence was overturned and he was acquitted. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on bail of 10,000 yuan. Because the French Police Department was not satisfied, it petitioned the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court now revoked the acquittal of the second instance and sent the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. After being summoned by the Second Branch of the High Court, he escaped and has not yet been brought to justice. The Third Branch of the High Court ordered Wang's seven guarantors to pay the bail money they had guaranteed and to surrender Wang Xinggao within a limited time. This has been reported in this newspaper, but the matter has been going on for a long time, and there is still no news of Wang's whereabouts. The guarantors have only paid more than 19,000 yuan in bail money. Therefore, the Third Branch of the High Court again summoned the guarantors to court yesterday morning. Judge Chen Daqi presided over the interrogation in the Third Court, instructing that the guarantors must surrender Wang Xinggao as soon as possible within a week. If they continue to delay, the bail money will be confiscated and the guarantors will be transferred to the investigation agency for punishment according to the crime of facilitating escape.

### The Death of a Child Is Unclear, and the Court Is Requested to Examine the Body

The Words of the Boatman and His Wife Do Not Match, and the Deceased's Parents Twist and Control the Report

Gu Shunxi and Gu Tangshi, a couple from Jiancheng, have a son named Gu Changfa, 14 years old. Gu himself is a boatman, so he hired his son to work on the boat of his fellow villager Dai Kechi to learn how to operate a boat. Dai's boat travels between Shanghai and Qingpu. Unexpectedly, Dai's boat came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, bringing Gu Changfa's body. Gu Shunxi and Gu Tangshi were both sad and surprised that their son had left alive a few days ago and returned as a corpse. When asked about Dai Kechi, he claimed that Gu Changfa had fallen into the river and died. When asked about Dai's wife, she said that Gu Changfa had been beaten for stealing watermelon. The words of the couple did not match. Gu Shunxi accused Dai and his wife of abusing his son to death and twisted and controlled the Xinzha Branch. Because the child's death was unclear, the local bailiff Chen Zonghan was ordered to report to the local court for examination yesterday. The results of the examination will determine the outcome.

### Robbery on Zhoujiazui Road, the Robbers Were Arrested and Await Sentence

### Elementary School Student Kidnapped, Whether the Ransom Was Prepared for Rescue Will Be Strictly Investigated by the Court Yesterday

The Family of the Victim Firmly Denies, and a Search of Letters Yielded Nothing

Lu Changsheng, who lived at No. 59, Lane, 74, Rehe Road, used to be a rickshaw puller. His nine-year-old son, Yu Deming, attended the nearby Nanyang Elementary School. On the morning of the 22nd of last month, at around 10 a.m., Lu Deming and his maid Zhu Jinshi were on their way to school when they were suddenly kidnapped by bandits. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Detectives Li Wenbin, and Ji Xiucheng of the Hui Si Police Station arrested four suspects, Zhou Changgui, Lu Shougao, Yao Fuquan, and Liu Ruan, all from Jiangbei, and sent them to the First Special Court. After interrogation, it was ruled that Yao Fuquan and Liu Ruan had no major involvement and were ordered to be released first. Zhou Changgui was also involved in the case of robbing Yao Guoshi's family of more than 300 yuan worth of property at No. 24, Lane 228, Baike Road, and was ordered to be detained for further investigation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent the two criminals Zhou and Lu to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Judge Chuan Lin took the seat and continued the interrogation. Attorney Wang Yaotang of the police station stated that the case was being adjourned. The police needed to investigate whether the victim Lu Deming was rescued by his family preparing a ransom or whether the bandits released him voluntarily. Therefore, they inquired with Lu's family whether they had received a ransom letter from the bandits after being kidnapped. However, Lu's family firmly denied the ransom and said that they had never received a ransom letter from the bandits. However, according to what the police learned, the bandits did have a letter. Since Lu's family refused to hand it over, in order to clarify the facts, it was necessary to request the court to issue a search warrant and hand it over to the police for a search of Lu's house. Lu Delin then stated that his father had died early and Deming was his younger brother. He lived at No. 74, Rehe Road, and the rickshaw company was at No. 59, Lane, 74, Rehe Road. When Judge Chuan asked if he had received a ransom letter, Lu replied no and denied that the handkerchief of the victim found by the police at Zhou's house last time was his family's item. Judge Chuan, seeing that Lu refused to reveal the truth, issued a search warrant in court, ordering the police to immediately go to Lu's house to search. Then, Mei Sheng, the Western police chief of the fingerprint room of the Gongbeiju, testified that the fingerprint left on the box at the time of the robbery at No. 24, Lane 228, Baike Road matched the fingerprint of the defendant Zhou Changgui, and presented an enlarged photo of the fingerprint. Zhou Changgui still denied the kidnapping case, but admitted that he went to the Baike Road robbery case. The court ruled that the case would be adjourned for seven days for further interrogation, and the two defendants were returned to custody. It was also heard that the police found nothing after searching the victim's house.

### The Beginning of a New China

— Ruo Yun

The glorious national war of resistance has begun! "Once the war has begun, because we are a weak nation, there is no room for compromise. If we give up an inch of land or sovereignty, we will become eternal sinners of the Chinese nation. At that time, we can only fight with the lives of the nation to seek our final victory."

The national war of resistance is an arduous task, and its final victory cannot be obtained by chance. It must be paid for with a very high price: in terms of time, we dare not say how long it will last; in terms of space, it is even more uncertain which piece of land can avoid being hit by artillery fire. However, since we have undertaken the important mission given to us by history, and we have made the greatest determination, ready to sacrifice anything, even our lives, without hesitation, then what do we have to fear? "There is no greater difficulty than death." For the survival of the nation, we should and are willing to endure this joyful hardship.

We are proud to be able to experience this arduous work! We are proud to be born in this great era of China!

However, the national war of resistance is by no means a matter of emotion, let alone an emotional outpouring. We should be more rational and calm. Since the national war of resistance is a long and arduous road, we should complete the entire journey, and only when we reach the end can we have a good time of rejoicing. Now is the beginning of getting ready to go. In order to conserve our energy, it can also be said that in order to reach the other side of victory faster, we should suppress our emotions in our hearts and take big steps with reason.

Hearing that our army has recovered Fengtai, Langfang and other places, the whole city is excited (no, it should be said that the whole country is excited). Everywhere in the streets and alleys, people automatically use firecrackers and national flags to express their inner joy, to express their enthusiastic emotions, and to vent their long-accumulated depression. From these unanimous and conscious actions of the whole people, we can certainly point out that our compatriots have inevitably taken the national war too easily and underestimated the enemy. However, if we look at it from another angle, can't we also see where the public opinion lies! And the people have been tired of hearing humiliation for a long time, and the "low pressure" they have experienced is even longer. Once they hear the battle report, once they hear that our patriotic soldiers have not failed their mission, have risen up to resist, and the initial result of the battle is to take Langfang and Fengtai in one go, how can people not love and be happy to the extreme, and use national flags and firecrackers to express their inner joy? This is also human nature. We can certainly demand perfection and blame them, saying that such actions are premature and short-sighted, but if we see it as a celebration of China's national fortune entering a new stage, we should not say it is too much!

Yes, this is the beginning of a new China. The firecrackers of the whole country are also the signal guns for the new China's march. From now on, the iron will of the whole country will shatter all obstacles that hinder China's progress.

In this arduous and long journey, the difficulties it encounters are undoubtedly conceivable. The enemy is not only brutal, but will never be as weak as the short-sighted people imagine, and can be wiped out by us in one go. As for Fengtai and other places, according to today's (29th) newspaper, have they not fallen again? And within our own camp, for the sake of profit and for their own interests, there will certainly be traitors who betray national interests. For example, as soon as the national war of resistance began, there was the Shahe Security Team that colluded with the enemy. These are the best examples.

However, it is not necessary to be disappointed and lament because of these setbacks, just as it is to be ecstatic when hearing the good news from one or two places. We should estimate these setbacks in advance, just as we should release all political prisoners and work together for national liberation under the same goal, and strengthen our strength in the same way. At present, we should no longer have party distinctions, but only hatred of the enemy. We have only one goal: to resist the enemy and save the country. Besides traitors, what other hatred can we not resolve?

Today's China is in a very dangerous situation, but we firmly believe in a victorious tomorrow. From the dangerous today to the victorious tomorrow, there will be a very arduous road. On this road, we will have great sacrifices. To what extent will we have to sacrifice, and how long will it take us to reach our destination? This depends on whether the pace of our whole people is consistent, and it depends on our combat ability.

The signal gun of the new China has sounded, which is worthy of our encouragement. However, please do not forget that we still have a long and arduous road ahead. On the road, we should certainly be brave and take the lead, but at the same time, we should calmly deal with it, neither fighting nor engaging in emotionalism.

### Depression

— Ma Jia

If yesterday (July 28th) was "a day to raise our eyebrows and exhale," then what kind of day should today be considered? Is it "a day to hang our heads and lose our spirits"? Of course, it can also be said that, but this "hanging our heads and losing our spirits" is only a momentary emotional effect!

Yesterday I didn't go home all night. I went to a friend's rented front building in the French Concession and stayed there for the night. I almost forgot all the worries of my life. Among my friends, I am considered a very happy person. As soon as I got there, I said to A'huang:

"A'huang! The day to get ahead has arrived!"

But even the old Peng I disliked said with a sneer:

"Ma Jia! Don't be too excited. During the January 28th Incident, didn't the Shanghai citizens also rejoice for a while when our army seemed to have launched a counterattack and won, and our army had advanced aggressively from the Zaozhuang Road Station to the North Station, and General Shirakawa was killed in the Liuhuo battlefield? Ma Jia! I jumped on top of the tram and cheered loudly, and later, my face was full of tears, and I didn't even know it! But what about tomorrow? It makes you laugh and cry! So Ma Jia! Don't be too excited!"

I stared at him with my eyes wide open. I only blamed him for being too inappropriate, pouring cold water on people when they were excited. But Xiao Zhu shouted at Lao Peng:

"You know, the current environment is not like the January 28th Incident!"

Lao Peng didn't say anything, but a gloomy look appeared on his face, and he sneered. I immediately forgot about Lao Peng. I said to A'huang and Xiao Zhu:

"Hey! Now is an extraordinary period! We should think about doing some work for this extraordinary period."

This sparked a discussion among us. Xiao Zhu said he wanted to join the volunteer army, A'huang said he wanted to do rescue work, and I, on the other hand, was very happy to be a "frontline journalist." We didn't ask Lao Peng, he was thrown away by us like a pile of garbage.

We talked about our respective ambitions, we talked about the joy of each of us doing our own work if "that day" came. We talked like this as if we were dreaming, until we heard Lao Peng's snoring, and we realized that the clock on the small table was already pointing to 2:15 am. I said with a smile.

"Xiao Zhu, A'huang, now our army must have driven the Japanese soldiers out of the customs in one breath! We are just waiting to go back to our hometown!"

Everyone applauded and laughed, and we all said: "Let's sleep, we'll talk about it tomorrow!" and went to sleep. To tell you the truth, I was already dreaming of going to the front line to report the news!

Probably around 6:00 in the morning, we all woke up. A'huang was the first to ask loudly:

"Has the newspaper arrived yet?"

"Bah! It's only 6:00 now." Xiao Zhu jumped out of bed. Everyone followed suit and got up to rinse their mouths and wash their faces.

"Why isn't it here yet?" A'huang was still anxious.

"It won't be that fast. Usually, the newspaper is delivered at 8:00 at the earliest." Xiao Zhu seemed to be comforting A'huang, but also comforting himself.

I said: "Today's newspaper will be great! Hmph! I'm just going to tell you to tear up the newspaper and call it quits!"

"That's right, we only have one newspaper here. When it comes, I'm afraid it will really be torn up. Let's go buy one!" A'huang said anxiously.

"Lao Peng! Go buy one for us!" Xiao Zhu gave the money to Lao Peng.

Although Lao Peng is the one we dislike the most, he is very loyal, so sometimes we like him the most. He said:

"Okay! I'll go buy one with you, I'll bring you good news!"

We all felt that although his words contained sarcasm, at the same time we felt that his sarcasm would make him learn to make an embarrassing, crying and laughing expression after he bought the newspaper. We all guessed wildly! Even if the Japanese soldiers were not driven out of the customs, they must have been pitifully chopped by the broadsword team of our heroic 29th Army. We also guessed that the troops in Suiyuan would definitely respond to the 29th Army and start attacking the enemy's rear, we...

At this time, Lao Peng appeared in front of us with a dejected face. He slumped and threw the newspaper to us. Of course, we rushed to grab the newspaper. A'huang shouted:

"Don't grab it, spread the newspaper on the ground and everyone squat down to read it.

We all agreed with his words. A'huang opened the newspaper. I found that his hands were shaking very badly. We all held our breath.

The newspaper was opened!

"Shahe Security Team colludes with the enemy, the situation in Beiping has changed suddenly this morning."

The subheadings are:

"Song Zheyuan led his troops to Baoding at midnight, Feng Zhi'an, Qin Dechun, and Chen Ji'an accompanied him, and Zhang Zizhong concurrently served as the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council."

Then there is:

"Our army withdraws from Fengtai!" "Japanese army counterattacks Langfang."

"Hey! Hey! What's going on? What's going on?" We all asked each other at the same time, and stared at each other blankly for a while. A'huang kicked the newspaper to pieces. Xiao Zhu's throat was blocked and he couldn't speak. As for me, I was just panting like a cow. I felt that I was going to be laughed at by Lao Peng this time. I glanced at him, but he was wiping away tears. Oh dear! This time, I suddenly felt a shock in my heart, my nose tingled, and two tears fell down.

The room suddenly became quiet. The four of us each found a seat and sat down, as if we were angry with each other. Everyone was hanging their heads, ignoring anyone.

### Extra Edition (Continued from Yesterday)

— Li Yinfei

In just one night, the situation in North China has become tense again. The mask of withdrawing troops has been torn off. Under the combined attack of aircraft and heavy artillery, Langfang Station has been occupied again. The dream of those who seek temporary peace should also be shattered, right?

Therefore, I took out the unfinished reply I wrote last night again and planned to add a few sentences to it to send to him, and in the end, I decided to end it with "I hope to see my old friends on the front line."

After the letter was written, there was a sudden disturbance in the alley, with hurried footsteps and shouting with excitement:

"Do you want to see the extra edition that has just been published! The Japanese are bombing Beiping!"

"Bombing Beiping"! These four words were like a hammer, hitting me and hitting the people around me, so the whole alley woke up, like a spring thunder.

The spring thunder followed the newsboys away, but the merchants were still gathered together expressing their anger that had been suppressed in their hearts. A loud voice was shouting, "If we don't rush out to fight, can we still live?"

A few "bamboo forest travelers" upstairs seemed to be discussing national affairs at this time. The voices were buzzing and blurred, and it was difficult to hear clearly, only intermittently saying something about "Beijing" and "Emperor Xuantong".

I reopened the letter and wrote a few sentences at the end, "P.S.: Reading the extra edition, the enemy is attacking our Beiping. Chairman Chiang said: 'If Lugou Bridge can be oppressed and forcibly occupied, then Beiping, the center of northern political culture and military stronghold of our five-hundred-year-old capital, will become the second Shenyang. If Beiping becomes the Shenyang of the past, then today's Hebei and Chahar will also become the four northeastern provinces of the past. If Beiping can become Shenyang, why can't Nanjing become Beiping?' What are your thoughts, brother, who lives near the front line?"

The people in the alley were still reading with gusto. The son of the second landlord downstairs, a fourteen-year-old junior high school student, was teaching his younger siblings to sing the March of the Volunteers: "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!..."

I went out to mail the letter. When they heard the sound of the stairs, they stopped singing. When they saw it was me, they asked in disappointment, "Mr. Li, has Mom finished playing mahjong yet? My younger brother doesn't want to sleep."

I shook my head and said to him in a comforting tone, "You should teach your younger siblings to sing well."

### Donate Money to Purchase Gas Masks and Transport Them to the Front Line

— Jing Jing

The bravery of Chinese soldiers has always been famous. Just look at the Chinese soldiers rolling towards the enemy camp, half-naked, with broadswords in their hands. There is no one else but Chinese soldiers who will keep going until their heads are cut off.

If such brave soldiers have complete military equipment, they will be victorious in battle. Now that the war has broken out, the poison gas that the enemy is shipping in boatloads is about to be released. No matter how brave you are, you will have to go to the underworld.

Yesterday (28th), I saw in the news of this city in this newspaper a passage about the Shanghai Municipal All-Circles Fundraising Committee for Gas Masks asking all circles to donate money to purchase gas masks, and I strongly agreed with it after reading it.

Seeing donations everywhere to comfort the soldiers in North China every day, it can be seen that there are many enthusiastic patriots. Now I hope that you will turn the money into gas masks and send them to the front line so that the soldiers can use them immediately. This is better than donating money. This is what the front needs urgently and cannot be delayed. I hope that patriotic people from all walks of life will generously donate money and quickly buy a few more gas masks and transport them to the front line.
