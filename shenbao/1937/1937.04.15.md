### Wang Yongbin's Views on the Judiciary

[Nanjing] Wang Yongbin completed his inspection of the judiciary in northern Jiangsu and returned to Nanjing on the evening of the 13th. According to Wang, the new courts have not been established for long, and it is still difficult to judge their merits and demerits. Generally, the number of cases received and concluded by each court is roughly equal, and there is also less abuse of detention of criminals. As for the prisons inspected, the one in Nantong is relatively clean, while the rest in the counties are crowded. The reason is that the administrative organs send too many bandits and opium offenders for detention. According to statistics, the courts only detain about one-tenth of the total number, while those sent for detention account for nine-tenths. Because the criminals managed by the courts and the administrative organs are all detained in the same place, the prison feels overcrowded. Wang has ordered the presidents of the courts and the county magistrates to negotiate nearby to find ways to divert the criminals, so that after the weather gradually becomes hot, there will be no epidemics and harm to humanity.

Current Commentary

### Prospects of the Japanese Political Situation

— Yu

It has been exactly half a month since the Japanese House of Representatives was suddenly dissolved on the 31st of last month. In these half a month, the struggle between the government (the government under the command of the military) and the established political parties has entered an unprecedented white-hot stage. The government's greatest effort is to organize a new party, wanting to use the so-called new party as its open rubber-stamp organization and compete with the established political parties in manipulating the next parliament. On the 10th, the government announced a new policy divided into eight major items, including foreign affairs, domestic affairs, economy, finance, and even culture and education, etc., to appeal to the people. At the same time, the military personally took action, not only for the soldiers but also for the people in various regions, actively instilling fascist ideology, rejecting liberalism, and competing with the established political parties for the voting masses.

As for the established political parties, in order to maintain their last-ditch fate, the surge of fighting spirit of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties is indeed rare in recent years. The two parties are not only intensifying their activities in each constituency individually, fighting against fascism, but also have established a strong united front in order to concentrate their strength, jointly dealing with their current enemies. The opinions of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have at least converged at this stage.

Naturally, it is not easy to accurately judge who will win or lose between the above two forces. However, generally speaking, it may not be possible for the government (or the military) to completely eliminate the old political parties according to its ideals. Looking at the situation in the past few days, the organization of the new party has clearly encountered many difficulties. First, the so-called maturity of the new party is only the subjective maturity of the government and the military. The actual supporters of the new party are not necessarily enthusiastic. Although several small fascist parties such as the Showa Society support the new party, and some cadres and members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have also separated and will join the new party, the number is still limited after all. Second, those who are engaged in organizing the new party do not seem to be consistent. They are a rabble, including soldiers, bureaucrats, financial tycoons, members of various fascist parties of all kinds, and defectors from established political parties. The composition is very complex and difficult to form a solid combination. Third, due to the complexity within the new party, the so-called party leader has become a problem. Konoe Fumimaro, considering the dim prospects, has declined the promotion of Hayashi Senjuro. Others such as Hiranuma, Yuki, and Hirota each have considerable voices, but none of them are the most appropriate figures. Even if Hayashi Senjuro personally takes the stage, the development of the new party will still not have much certainty. Fourth, the strength of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties relatively weakens the government's power. Although the established political parties have lost the sympathy of many people due to their past corruption, most people are even more dissatisfied with fascism. They feel that it is better to continue to support the established political parties than to let fascism be authoritarian. Therefore, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are likely to win more votes in the election.

From this point of view, the Hayashi cabinet has indeed shown signs of failure in the next parliament. If the cabinet does not resign, it may resort to drastic illegal means again, or re-announce the dissolution of the parliament, or even more directly eradicate parliamentary politics and implement truly powerful politics. However, in the meantime, it is clear that there must be a period of friction. It is not only difficult but also impossible to completely eliminate the power of the established political parties at once. At the same time, we should not ignore the power of the proletarian parties that are secretly expanding. If the leaders can do well, the driving force of the proletarian parties on the Japanese political situation will also have a great effect.

In short, it seems that the Japanese political turmoil will not be easily resolved in the near future. There will still be a period of friction. It is certainly impossible for the established political parties to regain their original status, but the reality in Japan will not easily allow a completely German-Italian-style fascist regime.

### Prime Minister Hayashi Invites Kodama to Study Sino-Japanese Relations

And Plans to Convene a Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Economic Cooperation Policies

[Tokyo] Kodama Kenji, the head of the economic mission to China, met with Foreign Minister Sato on the 8th and reported the results of his inspection of China. However, Prime Minister Hayashi decided to invite Kodama to the Prime Minister's official residence after the cabinet meeting on the 16th to report on the inspection to the cabinet members and to discuss the fundamental direction of future China policy. On Foreign Minister Sato's side, because it is now necessary to rebuild the fundamental direction of China policy, and the Foreign Minister takes the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations as the central goal of diplomacy, he plans to convene a meeting of relevant cabinet members based on Kodama's report to discuss China policy centered on economic cooperation. By the end of the month, he will recall Ambassador Kawagoe and begin to study its specific plan. However, within the Japanese government, there are some misunderstandings about Foreign Minister Sato's reciprocity and equality theory on the Chinese side, so some people advocate a tough stance, believing that the time for compromise is too early. From this point of view, it is questionable to what extent Kodama's economic cooperation policy can be realized. (14th Domei News Agency dispatch)

### Sugimura Yotaro Transferred to Ambassador to France

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato's appointment of Sugimura Yotaro, the ambassador to Italy, as the ambassador to France has been agreed to by the French government. It is scheduled to be decided by the cabinet meeting on the 16th, and after requesting approval, an official order will be issued. After Sugimura takes office as ambassador to France, his original position as ambassador to Italy will be succeeded by Hotta, the minister to Switzerland. (14th Domei Telegraph)

### Japanese Election Battle in Full Swing, Struggle Between Left and Right Wings Increasingly Obvious

Social Democratic Party Clashes with Fascist Groups; Police Confiscate 10,000 Copies of Right-Wing Declarations

[Tokyo] The Japanese election battle is now in full swing, and the intensification of the struggle between left-wing and right-wing political groups is becoming increasingly obvious. The Social Democratic Party held a meeting in Tokyo today, chaired by the party's president, Abe Isoo, and immediately passed the slogan "Crush Fascism." Shortly after the meeting adjourned, a group of extreme right-wingers, claiming to be members of the Founding Society, rushed into the meeting place of the party's gathering, shouting the slogan "Bury the Social Democratic Party traitors," and had a fierce clash with the Social Democratic Party. The police arrived at the scene to suppress and intervene, and the turmoil was calmed down. At the same time, the police today discovered 10,000 copies of declarations with激烈的措辞 sent by a certain right-wing group to various places. They did not recognize the existence of parliament. The police confiscated them because they were disturbing documents that unsettled people's minds. The main figures on the left, including the Social Democratic Party and the Labor Council, occupied 20 seats in the recently dissolved House of Representatives. The Labor Council only occupied one seat in the House of Representatives, but as of now, the former has launched 64 candidates and the latter has launched four candidates to engage in the election. It is estimated that the left wing hopes to win 45 to 50 seats in the new parliament. These two parties are the only groups in Japan that dare to openly and loudly advocate anti-fascism, so their strength has become more consolidated than before. On the contrary, although there are many right-wing groups, their power is extremely fragmented and scattered. Even in the current election campaign, they are fighting on their own. The most noteworthy among them are Nakano Seigo's Toho Society, Tanaka Ko's Yoseikai, and the Political Renovation Council. The Council includes Akamatsu Katsumaro's People's Association, Colonel Hashimoto Kingoro's Greater Japan Youth Party, and Lieutenant General Eto Genkuro's Meirin Society. The foundation of the left-wing groups almost entirely includes industrial workers and intellectuals, while the right wing is mostly based on countless scattered rural 比阶级, especially small groups composed of soldiers in their hometowns.

### Japanese Political Battle Enters Decisive Phase

New Figures Unlikely to Make Progress

[Tokyo] Since the start of the general election, it has been two weeks, and the number of candidates has reached 880 as of noon on the 14th. The number of candidates in various places is complete, and their enthusiastic curtain is about to unfold. As for observing the candidate situation of the various parties, the Seiyukai still occupies ten more than the Minseito party, showing its ambition to recover lost ground, but the order is lacking, which is unavoidable. The Minseito party is painstakingly anxious about the control of local branches. The Social Democratic Party also has 63 members,窥伺机会 to succeed in one fell swoop. As for the Showa and Kodo societies that hope to organize new parties, as well as the neutral parties in the new political situation, and others, they are aiming姿态 before exercising the决斗, which should be the central situation of the general election's interest. As for the candidates, they are divided into "newly elected," "incumbent," and "former" three types. Incumbents accounted for 424, while newly elected ones were only 311, still showing the tendency that new figures are difficult to make progress. The政战 has entered the second half, but the so-called peculiarity of this general election, as well as the insufficient preparation of the candidates, generally continue its low-key ear.

### Seiyukai Issues Declaration

Impeaching the Hayashi Cabinet

[Tokyo] Because the general election is approaching in a few days, the Seiyukai issued a declaration on the afternoon of the 13th,阐叨党's attitude towards the general election. The main points of the declaration are as follows:

First, Unconstitutional Dissolution

The 70th Congress was suddenly dissolved on March 31, the final day of the session. What is the reason? It is incomprehensible. Our party, in view of the importance of the current situation, postponed the纠弹 Lin Prime Minister's cabinet formation policy in order to review the budget and important bills as the first priority, and strived to coordinate with the government. As a result, the large budget of more than 2.8 billion yuan including the huge national defense equipment plan and various bills related to it were successively announced. All of this is nothing more than the opposition party's efforts to adhere to the expression of coordination under the principle of recognizing the current situation and the national position. How could the government take a challenging attitude after the budget was passed, abandon the most important bills that were about to be established, and 断行残暴地 dissolute? Can the people accept this silently? This is why our party 纠弹 the government's unconstitutional and un-samurai dissolution responsibility, and as one of the general election slogans.

Second, Insufficient Understanding of the Current Situation

We are deeply worried about the Hayashi Cabinet's foreign policy. Prime Minister Lin's parliamentary speech when兼摄 Foreign Minister and the newly appointed Foreign Minister Sato's parliamentary speech are inconsistent. The current cabinet is 彷徨 between these different views. Does it have a thorough and correct understanding of this pressing international situation? Our party believes that there are great doubts and fears. Therefore, we want to 纠弹 its responsibility for the Hayashi Cabinet's lack of understanding of the current situation.

Third, Rejection of独断

In short, we believe that the government's dissolution of the Yi Zeng this time is a manifestation of the government's contempt for the parliament's discussion of the old-fashioned卑届的 bureaucratic thinking. Other than that, there is no meaning to say. All matters are決於公論, and the basis of constitutional politics is also very important. Before 公論, no独断独行 is allowed. Therefore, it is appropriate to announce to the people the respect for the parliament's interests and quickly hang up the crown and thank the world for the crime of断行 dissolution of the parliament this time.

[Tokyo] The Social Democratic Party's declaration 指陈 the dangerous inflation that the huge budget案 will发生, and 要求 ① Stabilize people's lives, ② Compile the trend of rising prices, and reduce the burden on the masses, ③ 收主要实业为国有, ④ Improve political institutions, ⑤ 清除 the drum of Fascism, and set up a parliamentary government by the势动者, ⑥ Establish national diplomacy.

### Japan-India Cooperation

—Content published—

[Tokyo] Regarding the text of the new protocol attached to the Japan-India Trade Agreement, which was provisionally signed in Delhi on the 12th of this month by the Japanese representative Yonezawa and the Indian representative Tao, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following key points in a talk form on the 14th:

The draft protocol decided by the representatives of Japan and India on April 12 will be officially signed in London and will be effective until March 31, 1940. The content of the protocol is roughly the same as the protocol that expired on the 30th of last month, and the differences are as follows:

① Japan will purchase 1 million bales of Indian cotton annually and may export 283 million yards of cotton cloth. However, if the cotton purchase reaches 1.9 million bales, the maximum quantity of cotton cloth that can be exported can be increased to 358 million yards. ② If the quantity of imported cotton cloth exceeds the quantity in a certain year, it can be deducted in the following year, but the quantity allowed to be exceeded can be reduced from 20 million yards to 25 million yards. ③ In the old protocol, dyed cloth is divided into dyed cloth and dyed yarn, or printed, and the distribution of various cloths should be in the following ratio: 40% white cloth, 13% white cloth with divided edges, 10% bleached (mercerized), 17% dyed stripes, and 20% printed cloth. ④ Cloth pieces must be deducted from the prescribed amount, but the limit for Japan's exports of cloth pieces to India is 8.95 million yards per year, and India's import tax rate for this item may not be increased to more than 35% ad valorem, which has been agreed upon.

The notice issued by the United Kingdom on October 21 last year to abolish the Japan-India Commercial Treaty has been withdrawn on the 13th, so the treaty should continue to be valid, and the opinions of both representatives have been一致矣. (14th Allied Electricity)

### Japan Expresses Apology to Britain for the Keelung Incident, Resolution Reached

Taiwan Governor-General Disciplines Japanese Police, Britain Agrees to Cooperate to Prevent Recurrence

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that the case of British naval personnel being insulted by Japanese police in Keelung, Taiwan, on October 7th of last year has now been resolved. In response to a question from Labour MP Fletcher, Eden said that the case has been concluded. He also stated that the Governor-General of Taiwan, in accordance with the arrangements agreed upon by the Japanese government and British Ambassador Clive, has sent a letter to the British Consulate in Tamsui, expressing regret for the unfortunate incident and promising to take appropriate measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again, hoping that the British authorities would cooperate. The Japanese police involved have been disciplined by the Governor-General and will not be allowed to re-offend. The Governor-General's letter expresses the hope that the matter can be brought to a close in this way. After receiving the letter, the British Consulate in Tamsui was instructed by the Foreign Secretary to respond, agreeing that the case was closed and promising to provide appropriate cooperation to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] The British side considered the Keelung incident a major issue hindering Anglo-Japanese friendship, leading to political disputes in both the upper and lower houses. Diplomatic negotiations between Britain and Japan have been ongoing for half a year. It was not until the 11th of this month that the Chief Secretary of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office and the British Consul in Tamsui, Mr. Youngton, exchanged official documents resolving the incident, bringing the Anglo-Japanese dispute to a satisfactory conclusion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following informal announcement on the 14th:

After receiving the British protest, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had the Taiwan Governor-General's Office investigate the incident site repeatedly. As a result, it was determined that our officials were not at fault, rejecting the British protest. In view of the overall situation of Anglo-Japanese friendship, a cooperative attitude was adopted, and the incident was satisfactorily resolved. (14th, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] Upon seeing this article, British Ambassador to Japan Clive immediately lodged a protest with the Japanese government. Foreign Minister Sato immediately replied, saying that the article was not issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but was a misreport by a Japanese news agency. The government has instructed the news agency to retract the article. The Japanese government only announced that the case had been resolved through the exchange of documents between the Chief of Civil Administration of Taiwan and the British Consul in Tamsui, expressing mutual regret and promising that the relevant authorities would act cautiously to avoid the occurrence of similar cases in the future.

### Britain to Build Embassy in Nanjing

House of Commons Passes Funding

[London] Today, the House of Commons discussed the overseas public works construction budget, which included funding for the new British Embassy in Nanjing. This point was raised by Labour MP Valentine. Hudson, the Health Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary and the representative of the Ministry of Public Works in the House of Commons, stated that the requested funds were for the purchase of the site, including road construction costs, totaling approximately £150,000. As for Valentine's question about whether a new British Embassy should be built in Nanjing, he believed that the House of Commons and the entire British community in China agreed that the British Ambassador to China should have an official residence in the Chinese capital. The Nanjing Embassy building would be relatively large, and all embassy staff should live within the same compound, so adequate housing was necessary. The funds would be allocated over five years. The requested funding was then put to a vote and passed by the House. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

### British Foreign Secretary Claims Smuggling in North China is Gradually Decreasing

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today, in response to a question from Conservative MP Tetley, that the trend of smuggling in North China has recently shown signs of gradual decline. However, he is currently considering whether it would be beneficial to take further steps regarding this matter, in light of the information received from external sources.

### Germany Builds Defensive Works in the Rhineland Area

Opposite the French Maginot Line, Offensive Defense on the Eastern Border Against Czechoslovakia

⊙Meidi Germany is currently constructing defensive works in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, opposite the famous French Maginot Line on the border. Residents of the city of Meidi are paying close attention to this matter. Along the border, numerous machine gun bunkers and deep tank trenches are being built. It is reported that all bridgeheads, including those connecting to Saarbrücken, have been mined. The German defense line includes several areas in the center of the resource-rich Saar coal mining region, starting from Pirmasens, traversing the Palatinate region, and reaching Kaiserslautern. This section of the project is progressing rapidly and will soon be completed. At the same time, large barracks are being built in Neunkirchen. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

[London] The Manchester Guardian recently commented on Germany's defense arrangements on its eastern border, stating that Germany currently has three lines of defense on its border with Poland. The first line is along the west bank of the Warta River, from Breslau to Grünberg. The second line is in the Warta and Weide River basins, from Küstrin to Königsberg. The third line is in northern Pomerania, from Stolp in the north to Deutsch Krone in the south. As for the defensive works on the border between Germany and Czechoslovakia, in terms of defensive nature, they are far less solid than the Polish border. This shows that the German General Staff's military plans on the Czech border are not so much defensive as offensive. Furthermore, the large number of roads and air bases built by Germany in the Czech border area further proves that Germany's goal there is offense rather than defense. In addition, a large fortress has been built north of Posen to prepare for the installation of artillery positions. It is also reported that German artillery units will soon be able to bombard the Czech capital from a distance of 140 kilometers. Moreover, in southern Germany near Czechoslovakia, aircraft fields, armories, arsenals, and artillery and tank factories have been built from Lobau, via Treibach, Ursen, to Plauen and Leipzig, most of which are located underground to avoid artillery fire.

### Warships from Various Countries Gather in the Bay of Biscay

Spanish Rebel Forces Blockade the Port of Bilbao, Laying Mines Makes Navigation Dangerous

[London] Warships from various countries concentrated in the Bay of Biscay today, the strongest of which is the British cruiser HMS Hood, which is armed with 15-inch guns, pointed directly at the port of Bilbao. Spanish rebel warships are blockading the port, leaving thousands of residents in the Basque region on the verge of starvation. France is following Britain's lead in adopting a moderate policy towards the rebel blockade, warning French ships to stay away from Bilbao and Santurtzi. However, Paris has also issued a serious warning to Spanish rebel commander Franco, stating that if rebel forces obstruct French ships outside Spanish territorial waters, French warships will take retaliatory measures. Other countries that have dispatched warships include two German cruisers and one Norwegian ship. (13th, Kuomin News Agency)

[London] The Board of Trade recently issued a notice to shipping companies, stating that the Spanish Nationalist authorities have announced that they have laid a large number of mines near Cape Trafalgar in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Bay of Biscay. British merchant ships navigating in these areas should be vigilant. (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas)

⊙Bayonne, Southern France The Spanish Nationalist cruiser "General Cervera" recently issued another radio announcement, stating that any merchant ship entering the territorial waters of the Bay of Biscay and approaching the coast of the Basque Autonomous Region will be arrested by Nationalist warships. If they resist orders, they will be sunk. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

[London] The British Board of Trade yesterday notified shipping companies that the Spanish Nationalist forces had announced the laying of mines in the Bay of Biscay. Regarding this matter, Mr. Asna, the Minister of Commerce of the Basque Autonomous Region of Spain (currently in London), issued a statement saying that the government of the Autonomous Region is currently dispatching special vessels to clear mines in the territorial waters near the port of Bilbao, so there are no mines in that sea area.

### British Labour Party Censures the Government

Policy of Protecting Merchant Ships Encourages Rebel Forces

[London] At yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons, the opposition Labour Party expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the declaration made by Prime Minister Baldwin and immediately proposed a motion to censure the government. Sir John Simon, the Home Secretary, has confirmed that the motion will be debated tomorrow afternoon. (Central News Agency, 13th, Havas)

[London] Regarding the issue of British merchant ships being prevented from sailing to the port of Bilbao in northern Spain, the House of Commons met this afternoon to discuss the censure motion proposed by the Labour Party. Members of the opposition parties severely criticized the policy decided upon by the government (namely, that the British Navy would only protect British merchant ships on the high seas). Regarding this policy, a certain Conservative newspaper criticized Prime Minister Baldwin for not encouraging the arrogance of the Spanish Nationalist forces, causing unease within the Conservative Party as well. In addition, Mr. Asna, the Minister of Commerce of the Basque Autonomous Region, who is currently in London, is said to have declared to others that the Nationalist forces may have laid mines a dozen miles off the coast of Bilbao, but this does not constitute an effective blockade of the port. He also said that he came to London to discuss the export of Spanish iron ore needed by the British market, but since the British government decided on the policy regarding the protection of British merchant ships, he would suspend negotiations pending new instructions from the Autonomous Region government. Furthermore, according to the Daily Herald, although Prime Minister Baldwin declared that he did not intend to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government as a belligerent party, the British and French governments are currently considering the issue of recognizing both sides of the Spanish civil war as belligerent parties.

It is said that this proposal was initiated by Italy. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

### Fierce Fighting for Six Days Near Madrid in Spain

Rebel Forces Resist Stubbornly, Positions Remain Unshaken

⊙Madrid An Associated Press war correspondent learned today that the government forces' general offensive against the rebel forces near Madrid has been going on for six days. Although they have repeatedly charged with heavy artillery support for tank formations and infantry, the rebel forces have stubbornly resisted, holding their semicircular positions, and they have not been shaken. The government forces' offensive is now showing signs of exhaustion. This large-scale counter-offensive by the government forces appears to be a final strike. If it fails, it will be enough to affect the defense of the city of Madrid. (13th, Kuomin News Agency)

⊙Madrid The Commander-in-Chief of the government forces at the front, Miaja, today ordered the artillery to bombard 10,000 rebel forces trapped in the university district. The rebel forces there have been without food for three days, and they are also lacking water and ammunition. (13th, Kuomin News Agency)

⊙Madrid A special dispatch from a Havas correspondent reports that this morning, the Nationalist forces near the "French Bridge" in the southwestern suburbs of the city launched a fierce attack on government forces' positions (between the Manzanares River and the university district). In this battle, the Nationalist forces used their most elite units and used tanks as cover. The battlefield was full of shell craters, with rainwater accumulated in them. Soldiers from both sides mostly lay in the shell craters for cover and threw hand grenades, similar to the situation during the European war. The government forces' artillery fire was quite accurate, and they also threw explosive packs to stop the tanks from advancing. The Nationalist forces were ultimately unable to withstand the attack and retreated. In total, after four days of fierce fighting, there has been no change in the positions. In addition, in the area of the town of Getafe in the southern suburbs, the government forces advanced westward and immediately occupied more than 100 houses in the town of Getafe.

⊙Barcelona The government forces are now on the offensive on the Aragon front, simultaneously attacking the Nationalist forces' positions in Huesca, Tardienta, Belchite, Mondaral, and the Alcubierre Mountains. They have already occupied the important town of Dosos (south of the city of Zaragoza), so the government forces' positions in the Belchite area have advanced. (Central News Agency, 13th, Havas)

### Germany Issues Reply to Papal Encyclical

Wording is Extremely Harsh

[Berlin] Pope Pius XI issued an encyclical on March 21 criticizing the German government's improper interference in religious beliefs. The German government has now issued a formal reply to the encyclical, and the wording is extremely harsh. It expresses resentment for the Pope's criticism of German internal affairs and implies that the government does have the right to restrict church activities because the government has the obligation to maintain national unity. Therefore, it cannot tolerate the church establishing another country within a country and governing itself independently, and clergymen cannot separate themselves from society and form a separate class. The reply also states that anything that harms Germany's internal life is difficult to permit, and it declares that whether peaceful development is possible depends on the attitude of the Vatican and its ability to adapt to the new German environment. It is strange that the church is trying to organize a general anti-German front on the one hand, and asking for the help of the world's conscience on the other. Furthermore, the papal encyclical stated that Catholicism is subject to various restrictions by the government in Germany, but the German government's reply stated that when the German government and the Pope concluded a concordat in the past, the German government had made great concessions, and the German government has always adhered to the provisions of the agreement and there is no breach to speak of. Moreover, German National Socialism has prevented Germany from becoming a Bolshevik state, that is, it has saved the church from being destroyed. The reply concludes by saying that these facts, coupled with the economic assistance received by the church, have exceeded the statutory obligations, so the Pope's accusations against the German government are unexpected.

### Startling International Conspiracy Discovered in the Holy City

Espionage Activities by a Certain Country Incite Revolution, Strange Assassination Case Leads to Exposure

⊙Jerusalem The police authorities here today discovered a startling international conspiracy. It is said that a certain country, seeking to expand its influence in the Mediterranean, planned to use large-scale arms smuggling and espionage activities to incite a revolution and separate Palestine from Britain. Recently, a man named Zangjie was murdered here. The police investigated the case and discovered the organization of the international conspiracy. It is said that Zangjie once served as the Deputy Minister of Ports of Soviet Russia. The murderer's name is Xin Weituo, and his home has radio transceiver equipment and a 400-yard-long tunnel leading to the orange grove where Zangjie's body was found. Later, the police also found the technician who installed the radio in the murderer's house, who committed suicide two hours before the murderer was arrested and burned several important documents. The remaining ashes revealed traces of Italian writing. It is likely that the murderer was the leader of a certain country's espionage organization in the Near East, and Zangjie learned too many of his secrets, leading to his murder.

### German Minister of Economic Affairs Meets with Belgian Prime Minister

Discussing Financial and Economic Issues

⊙Brussels The British and French governments recently entrusted Belgian Prime Minister Janson with an economic mission. Today, Janson met for the first time with Dr. Schacht, President of the Deutsche Reichsbank and Acting Minister of Economic Affairs. Newspapers have speculated that the Prime Minister must have inquired with the Doctor about Germany's views. According to semi-official sources, the Prime Minister touched upon issues such as the tariff truce, France's responsibilities, the possibility of a significant devaluation of the Mark, and the hope of the Bank for International Settlements to support the Deutsche Reichsbank. Schacht also met with many industrialists. According to another source, Dr. Schacht is now proposing a major plan to exchange products from Belgian colonies for German manufactured goods. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

⊙Brussels Newspapers here are paying unusual attention to Dr. Schacht's visit. According to well-informed sources, Schacht will discuss all kinds of economic and financial issues with the Belgian authorities. However, he denied the reports in newspapers a few days ago that Schacht would present a concrete plan to the Belgian government regarding loan methods or trade agreements.

### US Government Promotes Good Neighbor Policy

Signs New Treaty with Mexico, Abolishes Right of Troops to Cross Border

[Washington] The US government has once again made a good neighbor gesture. Secretary of State Hull and the Mexican Ambassador to Washington, Dr. Najera, signed a treaty today, abolishing the clause in the US-Mexico Treaty of 1853 that granted the US armed forces the right to pass through the Tehuantepec Isthmus. Before the Panama Canal was built, this area was an important shortcut connecting the Atlantic and Pacific coastal military areas. Although the US military has never passed through this area, the existence of this right has long been an ominous legacy of American imperialism in the eyes of the countries of Central America. The US government is now willing to eliminate it for the sake of implementing the Pan-American policy of good neighborliness. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

### Guangzhou Organizes New Silver Market

Business Operations are the Same as Financial Exchanges, Strict Qualifications for Brokers and Guarantee Deposits Required

Guangzhou's financial sector has long had a foreign currency trading market called the Silver Market. Transactions in the Silver Market are all futures transactions, which are different from the spot goods traded in silver shops. Most futures trading involves Hong Kong currency. Last year, when the Shaanxi Incident occurred, speculative merchants lost hundreds of thousands of dollars due to futures trading. As a result, more than 100 silver shops closed down, affecting the social economy of the time. In order to rectify the situation, the authorities sent personnel to stop futures trading to prevent major fluctuations in finance. Since the market was suspended, it has been nearly half a year. Merchants believe that stopping futures trading for a long time hinders the circulation of foreign exchange, and they requested permission to reopen the market. The Finance Department believed that the previous Silver Market was organized haphazardly and had no real guarantees, so both winners and losers had no security. Therefore, it ordered the Guangzhou Silver Industry Association to reorganize the Silver Market and draft new Silver Market regulations for the Department to approve. It is reported that the organization of the new Silver Market has been approved by the Finance Department. The organizational content is divided into three groups: 1. General Affairs Group, 2. Accounting Group, 3. Cashier Group. The Silver Market is allowed to trade in currencies of various countries (futures) and all domestic securities, and its business is no different from general financial exchanges. The qualifications for entering the market as a broker are strictly regulated as follows: 1. Anyone entering the market to buy and sell currency must fill out a voluntary application form in accordance with the regulations, stating that they will abide by the rules and regulations, be introduced by two members, and be allowed to join only after the order has been checked and found to be honest and no one objects within 10 days of posting the notice in the market. 2. If anyone monopolizes and disrupts the market or violates the rules and regulations, they will be expelled from the market immediately once discovered. 3. Anyone who has failed to repay debts to their peers will be subject to a penalty of not being allowed to enter the market for more than one year and less than five years. 4. The entry fund is 1,000 yuan. For any transfer of funds, the transferee must obtain the approval of the General Assembly and go through the first procedure before they can inherit and enjoy the right to enter the market. 5. Members who join the Silver Market have the obligation to be elected to work in the market. 6. Membership will be revoked if any of the following occurs: A. Being subject to bankruptcy proceedings, B. Being deprived of civil rights, C. Engaging in counter-revolutionary activities, D. Lacking capacity for civil conduct, E. Engaging in acts that damage the reputation of the Silver Industry Association or violate the regulations. When brokers enter the market to trade, they must first pay a guarantee deposit before they can trade futures. This trading guarantee deposit is determined by the Silver Industry Association according to the number of months of trading, and the amount of the guarantee deposit to be paid for every thousand yuan. The guarantee deposit is kept by the Silver Market Custody Association. The number of brokers entering the market is determined by the Finance Department, ranging from 60 to 80. Currently, the internal preparations have been completed, and the new Silver Market will be established around the middle of this month. (April 9th)

### The Re-establishment of the Shandong Silk Industry

Progress Made Through the Promotion of Sericulture Cooperatives by the Construction Bureau

Jinan Dispatch: The prosperity of silk production in Qilu (Shandong) has been renowned since ancient times, with Linqu County as the center. At its peak, the county produced four to five thousand dan (a unit of weight) of silk annually. In recent years, due to the decline of the overseas silk market and the sharp drop in prices, the hard-earned income of silkworm farmers could not prevent them from hunger and cold. Out of grief and indignation, some even cut down mulberry trees for firewood. Later, the Construction Bureau was determined to revive the industry and actively provide relief. It first organized cooperatives, improved silkworm varieties, and established silkworm drying facilities. The results were remarkable. Moreover, with the revival of silk sales last year, the farmers' interest in making profits doubled. According to investigations, Shandong's sericulture cooperatives are among the best in the country. Their equipment has reached a modern level and can compete with Japan. This year, the Construction Bureau ordered 10,500 sheets of silkworm eggs from the silkworm breeding farm of the Sericulture Improvement Committee in Zhenjiang. It is stipulated that 60,000 sheets will be distributed to Linqu and 500 sheets to Zouping. They have now been shipped from Zhenjiang (at a cost of seven jiao per sheet). The 12,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs produced by the sericulture experimental farm in Yidu will be distributed to Yidu (9,000 sheets) and Laiwu (3,000 sheets). In Linqu, one silkworm drying facility was established the year before last, and it has been decided to add four more this year. The facility has been shipped from Qingdao by sea and then transported to Yidu by train, before being loaded onto trucks for transport to Linqu. The foundation work is being carried out day and night. It is reported that each silkworm drying facility can handle 250,000 to 300,000 fresh cocoons, which greatly increases work efficiency. Even if the sales of cocoons are slightly delayed in the future, there is no need to worry about the moths emerging. In total, 200,000 sheets of silkworm eggs will be raised in Linqu this year (including 60,000 from Zhenjiang), which can produce 4,000 boxes of silk, i.e., 4,000 dan, with an estimated value of two million yuan, gradually restoring the numbers of the most prosperous times.

The full text of his report is transcribed below: 1. Fellow comrades, I have been in charge of the Nanjing Municipal Government for two years and five days. I am ashamed that I have not achieved much. Fortunately, thanks to the hard work of all comrades over the past two years, I have not failed the Central Government's trust and the citizens' expectations. Now, I will give a brief report on the work overview of the past two years for the reference of all citizens.

Regarding Public Works: (A) Roads: Since the 24th year of the Republic (1935), important trunk roads that have been newly planned and completed include: within the city, Moxie, Zhujiang, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shengzhou, Donghai, Zhongxing, Yunnan, Heilongjiang, Fujian, Chahar, Zhenjiang, Duolun, and other roads, as well as all roads in the residential area of the Fourth District; outside the city, Huanhu, Tongjiang, Suiyuan, Menggu, Guanghuamen to the airport, Hanximen to Sanwenhe, and the engineering school to the veterans' school roads, as well as the Xuanwu Park roads. The total length in the two years is about 87 kilometers. From the 16th year to the 23rd year (1927-1934), the total length of roads opened in seven years was 61 kilometers. The comparison shows an excess of 26 kilometers. (B) Public Buildings: In the past two years, new primary and secondary school buildings have been added, including the First Middle School, Normal School, Zhuqiao, Sanpailou, Wutaishan, Santiaoxiang, Shengpingqiao, Madaojie, and other primary schools, totaling more than 20 schools. There are also one municipal hospital and one infectious disease hospital, as well as clinics in Caofangxiang, Xiaguan, Xiaolingwei, and other places. There are four markets in Taiping Road, Dingjiaqiao, Bafutang, Yangjiahuayuan, and other places. In addition, there are also public buildings such as the Dengfushan Women's Vocational Training Center and the Badoushan Shelter. In total, they cover more than 32,000 square meters. Among the larger parks, there is one park in the central political district, with an area of over 80 mu. As for general construction in the city, the total area in the past two years is more than 62,600 square Chinese feet, with a cost of more than 17,785,000 yuan. (C) Housing for the Poor and Slum Dwellings: In the past two years, more than 480 rooms of housing for the poor have been added in Zhima Camp, outside Hepingmen, and in Qilijie and other places. Slum areas have been constructed in Shimenkan Xisuocun, Qilijie, and other places, and the shanty dwellers scattered throughout the city have been relocated there, with a total of more than 7,000 households built. (D) Public Cemetery and Crematorium: The city originally had no public cemetery. Therefore, the Dayingpan public cemetery and crematorium were built in the nearby suburbs. (E) Sewers: All newly opened roads have been immediately equipped with sewer pipes, with a total of more than 20 kilometers of main roads laid in the past two years. More than 20 kilometers of ditches and pipes have also been laid in old roads. The project of installing intercepting pipes along the river from Zhuqiao to Dongshuiguan has also been designed and is being tendered for construction. (F) Qin Huai River Dredging Project: The gates of the east and west water gates have been repaired, and a pumping station has been built at the Dongshuiguan. This year, more than two kilometers of silted sections from Sixiangqiao to the Tiechuangling brothels are being dredged. (G) Flood Control Dikes: In the past two years, the flood control dikes along the Yangtze River have been repaired, with a total of more than 30 kilometers of concrete stone banks and earthen dikes completed. (H) Agricultural Irrigation Projects: The largest is the Shili Changgou Dam and Sluice Project. Two sluices and 14 spillway dams have been built to facilitate storage and drainage. Last year, there was a bumper harvest, which had never happened before. In addition, the Zhujiashan River and Yunliang River have also been dredged to facilitate irrigation. (I) Labor Service: In the winter of the 24th year (1935), national labor service was organized, and more than 7,000 civilian and military workers were recruited to repair the dikes along the Yangtze River. Since July of the 25th year (1936), hundreds of prisoners and vagrants have been used to form teams to carry out simple projects such as digging rivers, leveling land, and burying stones. In the winter, 50,000 young men were conscripted from the city to dredge the Qin Huai River in the urban area and to dig ponds, build roads, repair dikes, and build sluices in the rural areas.

Regarding Finance: (A) Revenue and Expenditure: The total formal revenue for the 24th year (1935) was 6,600,100 yuan, while the total formal expenditure was 7,558,800 yuan, with a deficit of about 957,700 yuan. In the 25th year (1936), the total formal revenue was 8,316,600 yuan, and the total formal expenditure was 9,030,000 yuan, with a deficit of about 714,400 yuan. The amount of this deficit is quite large, and it is necessary to borrow from various sources for turnover. The revenue in the 25th year (1936) increased by about 1,714,400 yuan compared with the total revenue in the 24th year (1935), with the local business tax and local property revenue accounting for the largest increase. The expenditure also increased by 1,471,100 yuan, with construction expenses and educational and cultural expenses accounting for the largest increase. This is the real reason for the increased expenditure in the 25th year (1936). (B) Tax Reform: ㊀ Revising the regulations on land tax; ㊁ Sorting out old arrears of house tax; ㊂ Recovering the management of slaughter tax and banquet tax; ㊃ Levying land value tax; ㊄ Abolishing the entrustment of all trade associations to collect business tax; ㊅ Correcting the tax rates for brokerage firms and tobacco and alcohol licenses; ㊆ Establishing rules for rewarding those who report concealed tax evasion; ㊇ Comparison of increased tax revenue and municipal property revenue: In the past two years, the results of reforming various taxes and municipal property revenue have all increased.

Xueyanqiao Town in the Eighth District of Wujin County was quite lively on the 13th, which was a market day. At about 9 a.m., more than ten villagers passed through the Longquanshan area of Xingzhong Township in the district when they suddenly encountered a robber who blocked their way with a pistol, intending to search them. Among them, Zhao Quansheng said to the robber, "There's no need to do this; I know you," or words to that effect. At that time, the robber became furious and fired two shots at Zhao with his pistol. Zhao was unable to dodge and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He died of his injuries. When the villagers traveling with him saw the bandit shooting, they scattered and fled. The bandit, seeing that he had caused a death, also fled. When passersby discovered the incident, the bandit was already far away. The local Baojia leaders rushed to report it to Township Chief Chen Jing, who immediately telephoned the Local Court to send someone to investigate and take action.

After arriving in Yangzhou, they took rickshaws to visit the scenic spots in the northern suburbs of Slender West Lake. At 1 p.m., they returned to Liuhe by car and crossed the river by ferry.

### Jiaxing: Detective Harmed in the Line of Duty

Ding Shanzhang, a detective stationed in Wangdian by the Jiaxing County Detective Group, received a report on the 10th that a large number of smugglers from Jiangbei were in Zhongjiahui on the border of Jiaxing and Tongxiang. Detective Ding, along with the reporter Jin Debiao and others, went to arrest Chen Longshan, a member of the gang, and brought him back to Wangdian, where he was detained at the Wangdian Police Station.

### Ningbo: Zhejiang Fishermen Go to Fenghua to Petition

Fishermen from various coastal counties of Zhejiang Province, due to the remote location of the Shanghai Fish Market, which has led to sluggish sales and a sharp drop in fish prices, unanimously requested improvements, including the establishment of a branch market at Xiaodongmen in Shanghai to boost sales and maintain fish prices, as well as the cancellation of the 8/1000th fishery tax levied on the Shengsi Islands to reduce their burden. Representatives were sent by the county fisheries associations to petition various parties, but the establishment of a branch fish market, although approved by the Municipal Market Council for comprehensive planning, was considered too slow to address the urgent situation. Now is the peak fishing season, with hundreds of thousands of dan produced daily, but the fish market is still in the planning stages, so the distant water cannot quench the immediate thirst. The levying of the fish tax on the Shengsi Islands has been formally announced and is about to be implemented. Therefore, the fishermen in Shen, unable to wait, gathered more than a hundred fishermen who were about to sail, along with documents such as the Chongming proclamation, and joined the fishermen from Xiangshan. They gathered in Ningbo on the 13th and went together to Fenghua, each holding incense, to personally petition Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, asking him to consider the fishermen's difficulties and quickly order the Shanghai Fish Market to establish a branch market immediately and order the Chongming authorities to abolish the fishery tax levied on the Shengsi Islands.

### The Foreign Taxpayers' Annual Meeting Resolved to Postpone the Increase in the Municipal General Tax

The Public Works Department was ordered to postpone the implementation until January next year. The budget and final accounts were approved, and land committee members were elected. Mr. Arnold reported that there was no reason to disband the International Settlement Volunteer Corps.

The foreign taxpayers of the Public Concession held their annual meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM at the Grand Theatre on Bubbling Well Road. A total of 248 foreign taxpayers from Britain, the United States, Japan, and other countries attended. Mr. Macnaghten, a judge from the British Supreme Court, was publicly elected as chairman. The meeting approved the Public Works Department's 1936 annual report and final accounts, and the 1937 budget. It was resolved to postpone the increase in the municipal general tax until January 1, next year. The details are recorded separately below.

Opening of the Meeting

Mr. Arnold, Chairman of the Public Works Department, as well as British, American, and Japanese foreign directors, Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Public Works Department, Mr. Phillips, General Manager, and all members attended. Consular leaders, Norwegian Consul General Mr. Ole, British Acting Consul General Mr. Davidson, Swedish Consul General Mr. Bakefellis, and consuls from other countries attended to monitor the meeting. Following the meeting procedures, (1) Mr. Arnold proposed and Mr. Franklin seconded the motion to appoint Mr. Macnaghten as chairman of the meeting. Mr. Macnaghten immediately read the notice convening the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers issued by Consul General Ole, the consular leader. Then came the agenda, (2) Mr. Bisley was publicly elected as chairman of the meeting, followed by (3) announcement of the meeting's agenda.

Resolutions of Various Cases

(4) Mr. Marshall proposed and Mr. Davis seconded the motion to elect Mr. Pick as the land committee member for the next year. The motion was passed and approved. (5) Mr. Arnold proposed and Mr. Franklin seconded the motion to elect Messrs. Bailison, Dunn, Brent, and Porter as directors of the Public Hospital for the next year. The motion was passed and approved. (6) The Public Works Department's 1936 report and final accounts were approved. At this point, Mr. Arnold stood up to report (the original translation is below). After Mr. Arnold's report, taxpayer Mr. Bauer took the stage to speak, expressing his opinions on the education section, hoping that the Public Works Department would pay attention. He stated that if other expenses were necessary, they could be reduced as much as possible, but the education budget should be sufficient. Mr. Arnold then stated that the Public Works Department could accept this suggestion for consideration, and the case was also passed and approved.

Postponement of the General Tax Increase

(7) The motion to approve the 1937 budget, authorizing the Public Works Department to raise funds not exceeding RMB 12,500,000 for special expenditures, was passed. The issue of increasing the municipal general tax was discussed as an attachment. Mr. Arnold reported (translation below). Mr. King (W.S. King) proposed and Mr. Kerrleigh seconded an amendment to the motion, changing the implementation date of the increased municipal general tax rate to January 1 next year (originally scheduled for July 1 this year). Mr. King also took the stage to speak, explaining the reasons for the amendment, stating that Chinese taxpayers have strongly opposed the Public Works Department's increase in the municipal general tax rate from July 1 this year, believing that it should be postponed by six months to observe the economic situation of the Public Works Department. In the spirit of cooperation, he also advocated postponing the implementation until January 1 next year. The chairman then asked Mr. Arnold for his opinion. Mr. Arnold said that the Public Works Department was prepared to accept this amendment because Chinese taxpayers held the same view, and cooperation could be achieved from all parties. Thus, it was passed without dissent. The chairman then read the amendment as follows: "The total expenditure and recommendations proposed in the 1937 budget proposed by this board are approved, authorizing the Public Works Department to raise funds, increasing the municipal general tax rate from January 1, 1938, to collect RMB 1,258,000, and to draw from the reserve fund or use other methods to balance the budget and offset special expenditures, but the total amount shall not exceed RMB 12,500,000." Subsequently, Mr. Al made a temporary motion, seconded by Mr. Singer, that the current Public Works Department board has made meritorious achievements and should be commended in the name of the meeting. The motion was passed and approved. The meeting was then adjourned, at 3:45 PM, totaling one hour and fifteen minutes.

Report of the Chairman

Mr. Arnold's report on the Public Works Department's 1936 municipal administration and accounting records, the original translation of the report is as follows: The activities of the Bureau in the past year have been widely publicized to the return community. The work achievements of the various departments of the Bureau have also been described in detail in the Bureau's annual report for the previous year. Therefore, I will only briefly state the most important special projects.

Roads Beyond the Boundary

The issue of collecting donations for houses on roads outside the boundary has recently been continued by representatives from the Public Works Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government. Both parties drafted an agreement yesterday, which has been published in today's newspaper. The draft must be approved by the next board of directors. From this, it can be seen that the entire problem of roads outside the boundary is very hopeful of being resolved soon.

Staff Reduction

Before the Bureau's board of directors adjourned for the summer vacation last year, it organized a staff economic committee. The committee's recommendations were highly regarded by the Bureau. What must be remembered is that the committee's task was not to implement austerity, but to investigate whether savings could be made without hindering office efficiency, and if so, how to implement them. Judging from the Bureau's accounts for the first half of last year, it is clear that the Bureau may request taxpayers to approve an increase in the municipal general tax rate. However, the Bureau believes that before making such a request to taxpayers, it should consider whether there are any areas where the Bureau's expenses can be reduced. The staff economic committee has thoroughly researched and considered this issue, and has proposed a plan to reduce administration, which has been adopted by the Bureau. According to this plan, approximately 900,000 yuan can be saved annually, and the Bureau can avoid the risks caused by exchange rate fluctuations. After the committee's report was published, it was criticized by various parties. The committee has considered these opinions and used them as the basis for amending part of its recommendations, resulting in a reduction in the Bureau's expenses without hindering office efficiency. The Bureau believes that this plan is reasonable for both taxpayers and Bureau staff.

Foreign Education

From the Bureau's financial situation, the Bureau must pay attention to the continuous increase in education expenses. Therefore, in October last year, the Bureau divided and organized a small committee whose task was to consider the Bureau's future policies for running foreign schools. The Bureau believes that the issue of foreign education is simpler than the issue of Chinese education, so it should be considered first. The committee has drafted a report and collected various data, listing the various complex issues that need to be considered. However, the committee's recommendations are not detailed. Therefore, the Bureau intends to further consider the issue, with the goal of changing policies, and to conduct detailed research by experts. How to implement this plan will be discussed by the next board of directors.

Reducing Rickshaws

When the taxpayers met last year, I described the rickshaw issue in great detail. I asked the Bureau to confirm that the duties of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee should be transferred to the Bureau's regular agencies for consideration within a considerable period of time. In October last year, the Bureau decided to transfer the duties of the committee to the police department by the end of the year to become one of the Bureau's regular affairs. Before the end of the year, the transfer was completed satisfactorily. Taxpayers can read the police chief's monthly reports published in the Bureau's gazette to know that the department is working tirelessly on the management of rickshaws. Regarding the reduction of vehicles, I said last year that if the number of rickshaws is reduced to less than what is usually needed, it will inevitably lead to monopolies and the abuse of buying and selling licenses. The Bureau must implement this gradually and test it to a certain extent in a certain limit. The needs of the public and the fair interests of the owners should be taken into account. In June this year, 500 rickshaws will be reduced. Whether it is necessary to reduce more in the future, and if so, when it should be implemented, will be decided by the future board of directors. The mission of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee has been completed. I take this opportunity to assure taxpayers that the Bureau will not make the committee's work equal to a waste.

Housing Problems

A year ago, taxpayers asked the Bureau to instruct the Works Committee to investigate all aspects of the housing problem and submit a detailed report along with the recommendations that the committee deems appropriate. This work, due to its special nature, took nearly a year. The Bureau's Housing Survey Committee has submitted a detailed report, and the new board of directors will review its various recommendations to determine how to implement them perfectly.

International Settlement Volunteer Corps

Last year, the funding for the Volunteer Corps was reduced, so there was a lot of talk outside. I hereby declare to you that the Bureau has no intention of disbanding the Volunteer Corps. When studying the Bureau's general austerity issues, the expenses of the Volunteer Corps must of course be paid attention to, but the security of the concession must also be taken into account. The Volunteer Corps has a long history, and its function is to defend against foreign aggression. In the past ten years, the political and other aspects of China have changed greatly. Therefore, we can expect that the status of the Volunteer Corps will be very important in the future. The Bureau has considered various situations and believes that for the sake of maintaining the security of the concession, the authorities should gradually make the organization and training of the Volunteer Corps able to achieve the above-mentioned goals. Some people outside believe that the Volunteer Corps is no longer necessary and has no function. However, based on past experience, there is always the risk of sudden and huge disturbances in the concession. The Volunteer Corps is sufficient to suppress riots, strikes, and public trends. Regardless of various public utilities, when there are incidents such as strikes and violence, the Volunteer Corps must also do its best to protect them. I firmly believe that the majority of people in all walks of life will regard the Volunteer Corps as a valuable organization when serious changes occur in the concession that affect their safety and stability.

Deficit

In the past year, the Bureau has made every effort to save administrative expenses. The Bureau organized a special committee to study the organization of the Fire Department. The committee suggested reducing Chinese and foreign staff in the Fire Department, which the Bureau considered feasible and would not affect office efficiency. Therefore, the Bureau has adopted its recommendations and implemented staff reductions, saving approximately 220,000 yuan in annual expenses. The expenses of the Works Department have also been greatly reduced due to staff reductions and improved methods of sweeping streets and collecting and disposing of garbage. Overall, the expenses of various departments are approximately 700,000 yuan less than the amount stipulated in the budget. However, in terms of the revenue and expenditure of the last year, the saved money was offset by the retirement benefits paid under ordinary expenses. This retirement benefit is only paid once, so expenses can be saved next year, which is still beneficial to the Bureau. The Bureau's regular income has decreased to a noteworthy extent due to the continued state of depression in various industries. The municipal general tax has been particularly affected by the reduction in rents and the increase in vacant houses. The amount of regular income is approximately 860,000 yuan less than the budget. At the end of 1936, the net loss after offsetting revenue and expenditure was 738,000 yuan. This number has been transferred to the 1937 budget. In recent years, although the Bureau has made every effort to tighten its belt and has achieved good results, the amount of expenditure still increases every year. The main reason is that the main construction costs opened in the regular budget are quite large. The Bureau's special expenses have been greatly reduced, and their use is limited to those of a major nature. Many plans should have been implemented, but due to the financial situation, they had to be postponed. Although, the Bureau's debt is still increasing slowly. In the past five years, from 1932 to 1936, the expenditure of various departments increased from 22.2 million yuan to 23.2 million yuan, an increase of approximately 1.25% per year. However, the situation of public bonds is completely different. In 1932, the Bureau had interest of 288,000 yuan to collect from the revenue of the electricity department. By 1936, the amount used by the Bureau to repay public bonds and included in the budget was as high as 1.4 million yuan, a huge difference. From this, it can be seen that the main points of various special income and expenditure have been described in detail in the report of the Director of Finance and do not need to be repeated. The amount used to widen and extend roads totaled 1.7 million yuan, slightly less than expected. In the past six years, this expense totaled approximately 14.25 million yuan. Therefore, the Bureau must withdraw 800,000 yuan annually for interest to widen roads or other municipal facilities. The purchase of real estate also affects the regular budget. As the remaining real estate of the owners is less, the land tax that the Bureau can collect will naturally decrease accordingly.

Proposal to Increase Taxes

Mr. Arnold also compared the 1937 budget in the attached explanation of the budget with the budget for the previous year in detail. The more important points are described separately. In the past few years, in order to balance the budget, the Bureau had to withdraw from the accumulated reserve fund. However, the Bureau has repeatedly reminded you that the reserve fund is not inexhaustible. Therefore, the Bureau will soon have to change the municipal general tax rate back to 16%. The currently budgeted income is more than 3 million yuan less than the budgeted expenditure. This deficit cannot be made up without increasing taxes. Municipal expenses have been strictly tightened in recent years. If further savings are sought, it will hinder office efficiency. Moreover, Bureau staff have sacrificed their personal interests greatly due to the Bureau's austerity measures. Taxpayers should also increase their burden slightly so that the budget can be balanced. After careful consideration, the Bureau believes that increasing taxes is unavoidable and intends to implement it from July 1. When submitting the tax increase case for your approval, I dare to declare to you that even if the taxes in the concession are increased again, compared with cities of equal area in the world, the tax rate is still the lowest. All walks of life will sooner or later understand that if the Bureau's budget cannot be balanced, various new facilities in the concession will not be able to be started. We certainly know that the economic situation in the concession and the living standards of its residents are quite different from those of foreign countries. However, if you are in any city in England, where the population is similar to that in the concession, you have to bear 64% of the taxes, or even more than this number. In recent years, the authorities in the concession have used huge amounts of money in education, social welfare, public health, and other municipal facilities, and they are constantly increasing. The current taxes collected are not enough to meet these needs. Other expenses cannot be saved any further, so as not to have a major adverse impact on the efficiency of office. In 1927, the municipal general tax rate increased from 14% to 16%. In 1929, the Chairman of the Public Works Department proposed to reduce the tax rate because the revenue from the sale of the electricity department was quite large. The following year, the taxpayers' annual meeting approved the reduction to 14%. The tax rate after this tax increase is still the same as that collected from 1917 to 1930. In the past few years, the Bureau, in view of the economic depression, did not propose to increase taxes. The difference between revenue and expenditure was made up by withdrawing funds from the reserve fund to overcome the difficulties. However, the remaining amount of the reserve fund is not much, so it cannot be used continuously. The current business situation is indeed picking up. The Bureau believes that proposing a tax increase is justified. After the tax increase, the burden on residents will not be too heavy, because those who pay 100 yuan in rent per month will only pay an additional 2 yuan in tax. Those who pay less rent will follow this analogy. If the tax rate is increased, the total amount of various revenues will be 410,000 yuan less than the revenue of the previous year. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, the net difference is more than 1.83 million yuan. Therefore, 1.85 million yuan must still be withdrawn from the reserve fund to make up for it. A lot of money is needed for various special expenditures. In order to cope with it, it is proposed to authorize the Bureau by taxpayers to raise funds by issuing public bonds or using other feasible methods, and the amount shall not exceed 12.5 million yuan.

### Cheng Tiangu Departed for Guangdong Yesterday

Mr. Rao Yongbi and Mr. Liu Chongde, who were sent by the Ministry of Industry to inspect the fishery situation in the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, returned to Shanghai on the 13th after completing their inspection of the coastal areas of Zhejiang. Due to the fact that the Ministry of Industry stipulated that the inspection period was only six weeks and the deadline was approaching, Mr. Rao and Mr. Liu rested briefly in Shanghai and then continued to inspect the situation of fishermen in the counties of Songjiang and Jinshan along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway yesterday morning (14th). They returned to Shanghai that evening and went to Changshu this morning and then to the Jiangbei area for inspection.

### Acting Mayor Yu Hosted a Banquet for Mr. Koso Yesterday Afternoon

He is scheduled to leave for his home country today. Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun of Shanghai Municipal Government specifically hosted a banquet at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon to bid farewell to Mr. Koso and invited the Japanese Consulate and senior officials of the Municipal Government to accompany him. During the banquet, Mr. Yu gave a speech, stating that he admired Mr. Koso's efforts to promote Sino-Japanese relations during his tenure in China and hoped that Mr. Koso would continue to work hard with his consistent spirit after returning to his country. Mr. Koso thanked him and the guests and hosts dispersed happily at around 1:00 PM. Subsequently, at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Mr. Koso personally went to the Municipal Government to visit Acting Mayor Yu to say goodbye. Mr. Yu and Commissioner Wang Changchun received him and talked for a long time before the end.

### The Ministry of Finance Allocated Public Bonds to Relieve Sichuan Disaster

Currently negotiating to mortgage cash, which will be allocated for emergency relief.

The Central Government, in view of the severe disaster in Sichuan Province, specifically ordered the Ministry of Finance to allocate 1 million yuan of unified Class E public bonds. The bonds have been handed over by the Ministry of Finance to Mr. Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief Committee, to Shanghai to negotiate the method of pledging cash with the banking industry in Shanghai. However, before Mr. Zhu went to Fenghua to pay tribute to Mr. Jiang Weiyuan's elder brother, Xi Hou, he entrusted Mr. Ren Shishang, manager of the Shanghai branch of Juxingcheng Bank, to be responsible for negotiating the problem of pledging cash. Mr. Zhu will return to Shanghai in three days and will go to Sichuan with Manager Ren to distribute money for emergency relief.

The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association of this city received disaster reports from various counties in Sichuan Province yesterday as follows: (1) Jiang'an, the county has suffered frequent droughts for years, the spring famine is severe, and many hungry people are taking risks. From the 20th of last month to recently, incidents of hungry people seizing rice have occurred repeatedly, with hundreds of people robbing food in groups. On the 23rd, more than 300 hungry people from the Naxi area of Xufu suddenly went to Suogou Township to steal food. Huang Jingzhi, the head of the township, led the Lian Ding to come out to suppress them in order to maintain law and order, but he was lifted up by the hungry people and thrown into the Yangtze River. Fortunately, he was rescued. (2) Fushun, the county has suffered from drought for too long, and hungry people have no way to make a living. Many have gone to neighboring counties to beg for food. Recently, incidents of abandoning young children have been frequently discovered. The situation of children waiting to be fed is extremely tragic and pitiful. Also, on the 23rd of last month, in the Huangjiao Ao area near Banqiao Town in the county, a group of hungry people gathered in the mountains to dig and eat mud, which caused the rocks to collapse, crushing more than ten people to death, and even more were injured. The county government now sends people to inspect the mud-digging sites every day. If they find that there is a danger, they will forcibly dissuade them.

### The Social Bureau Ordered Workers of Mei Asia Factories to Resume Work Yesterday

Workers in various districts petitioned to fulfill the conditions. The Tianyi Silk Factory has already announced its shutdown.

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, all factories belonging to Mei Asia have stopped production one after another since the night before last due to the strike of workers at the Jingwei Factory, which caused the raw materials to run out. The Social Bureau believes that the request of Mei Asia Jingwei Factory and the main factory workers to issue wages for the March 29th Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs Memorial Day is inappropriate and has ordered the silk weaving industry union of the first district to instruct the Jingwei Factory and the main factory workers to resume work on the scheduled date. As for the resolution method, because the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association has filed an appeal to the Municipal Government, it should wait for legal review.

Union Petition

The Silk Weaving Industry Union of the Seventh District received reports from member workers that various factories in the district have arbitrarily extended the code ruler and arbitrarily discounted it, violating the resolution of the Social Bureau's mediation. The union has prepared a standard municipal meter and went to various factories to remeasure the code, but was rejected by the factory. Therefore, yesterday, Hu Ying and others were sent to the Social Bureau to petition. Mr. Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the third department, received them and promised to investigate and handle the matter. At the same time, the silk weaving industry unions of the first, third, and fourth districts petitioned the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau to correct the failure of various factories to fulfill the mediation resolution in order to eliminate disputes.

Tianyi Shutdown

Qiu Peiyue, the manager of Tianyi Silk Weaving Factory on Pingliang Road in Pudong, who is a member of the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association, has declared a shutdown because of the workers' strike. Yesterday, he reported to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau for record. All the workers, because of the factory's shutdown, which is related to the workers' livelihood, sent worker representatives Ma Zongsui and others to the Social Bureau yesterday morning to petition for relief. Mr. Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the third department, received them and promised to investigate and handle the matter, and immediately sent mediator Zhang Chuqiang to investigate the truth in order to handle the matter. This newspaper's special dispatch this morning: After the workers of various branches of Mei Asia Silk Factory went on strike continuously from the 13th, the Social Bureau convened both labor and management for mediation and ordered the resumption of work. Unexpectedly, at around 5:00 PM yesterday, more than 300 workers from the second factory of the factory on Gonghe New Road in Zhabei, together with the workers of the tenth factory of the factory at Baziqiao, planned to go to the tenth factory to do something. The workers of the second factory had already arrived at the entrance of the tenth factory, but because they saw that the factory gate was closed tightly, they immediately gathered together to smash it, hoping to open the factory gate. However, the Municipal Police Bureau had received a police report and urgently sent the second squadron of the police, holding wooden sticks and bamboo canes, to the scene in two police vehicles to suppress them. The workers threw soil and bricks at the police officers to resist stubbornly. Because they were surrounded on all sides, they calmed down, but they still gathered at the entrance of the tenth factory for a long time. At this time, the workers of the tenth factory were coming from Shuide Road. A large number of policemen from the North Railway Station Branch were sent to guard the area and tried to stop them. Therefore, the workers of the two factories did not meet and no further incidents occurred. However, until the reporter sent the manuscript, the workers were still in a stalemate at the scene, and the police force and police vehicles had not been withdrawn.

### Haiheng Crew Members' Salaries and Wages Increased by 30% Across the Board

General Manager Cai has already telegraphed his approval.

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, since the Haiheng ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company changed its route to Xiamen-Philippines line, the business has been very developed. All crew members believe that they are still receiving domestic wages for operating on the high seas, which is contrary to the regulations of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, they telegraphed the bureau during the return of the first trip of Xiaoluzong, requesting the bureau to increase wages according to regulations. If there is no satisfactory solution, they will deal with it by suspending navigation. Zeng Guangqing, the inspector of the bureau, and Ma Jiajun, the captain, advised them to wait for a legal solution. It is now heard that Cai Zengji, the general manager of the bureau, believes that the crew members' lives are extremely difficult, so he has telegraphed, promising to increase the original salary by 30% across the board. Other crew members will also be given an increase.

### Records of People's Movements

Member of the Central Committee, Tian Kunshan, took the night express train to Beijing at 11:00 PM last night.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Develops Mid-Yangtze Shipping, Adding Two New River Steamers for Both Deep and Shallow Water

Costing 1.1 Million Yuan, Three-Cylinder Steam Engine Wheels

Since the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company convened a meeting of Yangtze River branch managers last year, it has decided to expand the mid-Yangtze shipping business, restore the routes between the Sichuan River and the mid-Yangtze River. First, the Jinjiang was newly built to travel all the way from Shanghai to Chongqing. This ship will be able to sail in July of this year. Now the bureau is taking a further step, and two new Yangtze River ships are also being built in the middle of the Yangtze River section, which are specially for sailing within the Hankou to Yichang or Hankou to Changsha routes. In order to suit the water scale in the central Yangtze River, it was agreed that these two ships would be specially built as the latest type of wheel that can travel in both deep and shallow water. The ship body drawings have been drawn by various engineers. Each ship has a load capacity of 350 tons, a ship length of 164 feet, and a draft that includes dry cargo is seven feet six inches. The engine uses a three-cylinder steam engine, which is extremely fast. It can travel 14 knots per hour. The cabins and wheels are all made of the strongest steel plates. It is said that the cost of the two new wheels will require 1.1 million yuan. In recent days, various engineers and shipyards have been very busy contacting the construction work. It has been decided that the two wheels will still be built by Jiangnan Shipyard. After these two ships are built and sailed, the upper, middle, and lower Yangtze River shipping business of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can be connected in a consistent manner.

### Shen Yaoting Went to Russia to Study Sewing Machines

The Xie Chang Dong Ji Company at the entrance of the Catholic Church Street in the French Concession specializes in selling various Soviet-made sewing machines. Since its promotion, it has been praised by users because of its very ingenious structure and lower price than other products. Mr. Shen Junshan, the owner of the company, knows that sewing machines are a necessary tool for families. If Chinese women continue to spin, weave, and sew themselves, if the countryside is revived, there will be a need to purchase sewing machines. At that time, relying on foreigners will be a huge drain. Therefore, he intends to raise funds to set up a factory to manufacture them himself. Therefore, he decided to send his son, Shen Yaoting, to Moscow to investigate in order to learn from them. Mr. Shen's son, Shen Yaoting, once studied at the Aurora University of Technology. He is only twenty-four years old, but he has quite a lot of research on the manufacture of sewing machines. Sending an envoy to investigate will be competent.

### Son Catches Mother in Adultery

Conflicting Accounts, Who Is Right and Wrong?

Zhao, a woman from Huai'an, aged fifty, lives in a shack near the Bingchangtian Ice Factory on Dongchang Road in Pudong. Her husband, Jia, passed away more than twenty years ago, leaving behind two sons, Bingqian and Bingkun, aged around twenty, who both work at the Yizhong Tobacco Factory in Lujiazui. Although Zhao is old, she is not used to sleeping alone. Five years ago, she met Chen Yuan, a fellow villager, and they began living together. Chen is now fifty-three years old and also works as a laborer at the Yizhong Factory. Since they met, Zhao's two sons have lived in the same house and have, in fact, recognized Chen as their stepfather. Their relationship was considered harmonious. However, late the other night, the Bingqian brothers stormed into their mother's room with wooden clubs and carried out "son catches mother in adultery." They dragged Chen out of bed and beat him with the clubs, causing injuries. Zhao stopped them and reported the incident to the Pudong Police Station, which took Chen and Bingqian into custody. According to Zhao's testimony, she was extremely poor after her husband died and endured hardship to raise her two sons, get them married, and start families. Because of economic hardship, she cohabited with Chen, who is honest and kind. Unexpectedly, her two sons repaid kindness with enmity, dared to catch her in adultery, beat Chen, and demanded one hundred yuan to settle the matter. They have no respect for their elders and should be charged with filial impiety. Chen's testimony was similar to Zhao's. According to the defendant Jia Bingqian, aged thirty-three, his mother began an adulterous relationship with Chen Yuan after his father's death. He and his brother had no right to interfere and allowed their mother her freedom. However, Chen recently held a fiftieth birthday celebration for his mother, sent out invitations, and solicited gifts. Chen took the initiative on the invitations, and the wording was absurd, referring to "my wife's fiftieth birthday on a certain day." Chen signed his name and added "with nephews so-and-so bowing." The names of his brothers were excluded, so they were extremely angry and drove Chen away. The director, after questioning and finding conflicting accounts, ruled that the plaintiffs and defendants be sent to the local court for further investigation.

### Worker Falls into Syrup, Dies from Injuries

Due to the intense work at the China Alcohol Factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, the original workers were insufficient, and more than a dozen temporary workers were hired. Yesterday morning around 7:00 a.m., a worker named Zhao Aqing (aged twenty-eight, from Ning County) accidentally fell into a syrup pool while working. Another worker saw him and managed to rescue him, but he was already barely breathing. The factory sent him to a hospital in Puxi Hunan for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital.

### Re-Trial of the Tang Youren Assassination Case; Two Defendants Retract Previous Confessions

Claiming Ignorance of the Tang Assassination; Court Orders Further Investigation Before Re-Trial

Liu Zhennan from Hubei and Qiu Jiyu from Shaoxing, the criminals in the assassination case of Tang Youren, the former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, were handed over by the French police to the Second Special Court. The police department filed a public prosecution against them for murder. After four hearings presided over by the former Criminal Division Chief Wang Shanxu, Liu and the others confessed that Yang Yousheng and others, who are still at large, instigated the murder. However, when the new Criminal Division Chief Liao Zheng took over the hearing, the defendants had been transferred to the detention center and retracted their previous confessions, denying their involvement in the murder. The details of the case have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Judge Liao continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Fei Xizhen represented the French Police Department in court, and the defendants' appointed defense attorneys, Yu Chuiluo and Peng Qi, also arrived on time. The court announced the reopening of the trial, first questioning Liu and Qiu about their age and origin, then asking them about the case. According to Liu Zhennan's testimony, he lived on Rue Robert and had been sentenced to five years and two months in the French Concession for a crime committed in the 18th year of the Republic. He was released on April 26th of the 24th year of the Republic. He met Yang Yousheng in prison, who was sentenced to eight months for forgery. He asked him to find him a job in prison. Later, he was released first, and Yang later went out and sent him a letter asking him to go to Xiao Peiwei's house in Junyi Lane, Rue Beller, where Yang and Xiao were relatives. Later, Yang and he went to Guangzhou to look for work and stayed at the YMCA. They met Qiu Jiyu there, who also came to Guangzhou. Later, because they could not find work, they returned to Shanghai with Qiu. He did not participate in the assassination of Tang Youren and did not know about the assassination. He was arrested by the Public Security Bureau on October 19th of last year. They told him that Yang Yousheng had been arrested in Guangzhou, Xiang Hangdang had been arrested in Hankou, and Qiu had been arrested in the Public Concession, all of whom confessed that he had shot and killed Tang Youren. They had already written it, asked him to put his fingerprint on it to admit it, and then confessed in court because he was afraid of being tortured if he went back to the police station. He was really wronged. Qiu Jiyu also testified that he met Yang Yousheng in prison. After being released, he asked Yang to find him a job. Yang asked Xiang Hangdang to go to Guangzhou with him to look for work without success, and he returned to Shanghai with Liu Zhennan. He had never been to the house at 233 Rue Gansi East and did not participate in the assassination. The rest of his testimony was the same as Liu's. Witness Zhang Rongle testified that Yang Yousheng and Miss Li lived on the second floor of No. 12, Building A, Lane 468, Avenue Joffre, for less than a month. They said they were going to Nanjing, and then said they were going to Hangzhou. As a result, they called and spent 220 yuan to buy plane tickets to Guangxi. When asked if he knew the two defendants, Zhang examined Liu and Qiu and replied that he seemed to have seen Liu but did not know Qiu. He also said that Yang Yousheng had come once in April of last year. Finally, after the defendants' defense attorneys presented their request for an investigation, the court ordered that the investigation be awaited before setting a date for a re-trial. The defendants were returned to the detention center. The court adjourned at six o'clock.

### Dock Scavenger Brutally Murdered

Beaten to Death with a Carrying Pole; Autopsy Conducted Yesterday

At six o'clock yesterday morning, in front of godown number B2 of the China Merchants Bureau dock on the Bund in the French Concession, a nameless male dock scavenger, about sixteen years old, was beaten on the back of the head with a hard wooden carrying pole. His brains splattered, and he immediately collapsed and died. The perpetrator fled. Chinese Constable No. 728 discovered the body and reported it to the Xiaodongmen Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. A hard wooden carrying pole, the murder weapon, was found near the body. A Shandong man named Jiang Xianzhou, a suspected perpetrator, was apprehended nearby. His hands and clothes were stained with blood. He was taken to the police station for investigation. The body was sent to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. At noon, Dong Qiming, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court, and a forensic doctor arrived at the scene to examine the body and confirmed that the deceased had been struck and killed. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. The police station handed over the perpetrator to the court for interrogation.

### Blind People Actually Gambled

Each Used Children to View the Numbers on the Dice; Dispute Arises and Lawsuit Filed

Judge Qiu Huanji of the Second Special Court heard a case yesterday morning in the Second Criminal Court about a blind man suing another blind man for fraud and assault. The case was quite comical, causing the judge to cover his mouth and the audience to burst into laughter. The case originated from a blind fortune teller living upstairs in the Xiangquan Bathhouse at No. 40 Du Shenfu Road. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, he sent someone to summon fellow blind men Qian Zhibai (31 years old, from Yancheng), who lived at No. 24 Deyu Lane, Sanguantang Road, Xu Fusheng (35 years old), a blind man from Jiangyin at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue Chaleux, and Chen Rongxiang and others to gamble. He led the way with a young boy, Bai Zhikun (14 years old, from Taixing), and Xu brought Li Erqi and Chen brought Liu Chenzi (both Li and Liu were 15 years old) to watch the numbers on the dice and determine the winner. A group of blind people were happily gambling, keeping the young referees who were watching closely on the sidelines busy. Around 9:00 p.m., Qian Zhibai was the banker, and Xu Fusheng lost 1,000 wen. He took out a one-yuan bill to get change so he could stop playing. However, Qian refused, insisting that Xu continue gambling. The two sides clashed, resulting in an unhappy breakup. The next day it rained, and the two sides gathered their blind soldiers and generals and agreed to settle the score again on Du Shenfu Road. When the time came, neither side showed weakness and arrived on time, attracting onlookers. After a brief encounter, they went to a teahouse to reason things out. Chen Rongxiang, fearing the matter would escalate, acted as a peacemaker. As a result, Xu Fusheng and Xu Tao paid for incense and candles to settle the matter. However, Qian Zhibai remained angry and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Xu Fusheng and his wife of fraud and assault and requesting an investigation. The court opened the hearing yesterday. The three blind men were each led to court by a child. First, the plaintiff Qian Zhibai testified that Xu Fusheng resented him because he had taken away Xu's customers. This time, he sought revenge through gambling. Xu testified that he lost 1,000 wen while gambling and took out a one-yuan bill to get change, but Qian refused, leading to a conflict that was settled with incense and candles. Now, he is suing me. The court also questioned the children present, as well as witness Chen Rongxiang. Because Xu's wife, Gao, still needed to be summoned, the court announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for the 19th.

### Plot to Steal Millions of Yuan Worth of Ancient Paintings from Wang Yiting's Home

Gu Fusheng Implicates Lu Xintang; First Sends a Letter to Notify and Warn

Gu Fusheng, a criminal, was suddenly apprehended at around 2:00 a.m. yesterday morning at the residence of Wang Yiting, a philanthropist and painter, at No. 194 Xunda Street in the Nanshi district, along with a large bag of stolen ancient paintings worth over 20,000 yuan. Wang's residence requested the police to bring the person and evidence to the Xunda Street police station for interrogation. Gu confessed that he was instructed by Lu Xintang to first send a letter in the name of "Jiang" stating that Wang's residence had valuable paintings, originally pledged by Yuan Shikai, including a "Golden Rooster Standing on One Leg" painting. The letter said there were plans for a burglary, with inside cooperation from the household servants. The letter urged the owner to be extra vigilant, paying attention to doors, windows, and the garden gate. Later that evening, Lu Xintang attended a dinner at Wang's residence and instructed Gu to hide in a dark room, but he was caught. Subsequently, Dong, the captain of the Fifth Detective Team, interrogated Gu, who revealed that Lu Xintang was hiding on the upper floor of the Wanmao Sauce Garden in Xinxing Lane, Dapuqiao. He instructed Wang's detectives to arrest the accomplices involved for interrogation.

### Injured Female Corpse Found in Suzhou Creek

Right Arm Severed by a Sharp Weapon; Severe Head Trauma

The previous evening, an unidentified female corpse was discovered in Suzhou Creek near the Shanxi Road Bridge, floating with the tide. A Western constable from the Customs Water Police discovered it and brought it back to the police station. The deceased was wearing a black cloth shirt with blue stripes, a red velvet vest, a green-lined spring jacket worn under a short shirt, black gauze pants, and black socks. Her shoes were missing. She had naturally bound feet, white hair, and was about 52 years old. Her right arm was severed by a sharp weapon, with the bones dislocated and only connected by skin and flesh. There was also a severe head injury, with the skull shattered. The death was gruesome. The constable ordered detective Shi A'jin to take the body to the Nanshi Relief Bureau and report it to the local court. Yesterday evening, Prosecutor Lei was appointed to inspect the body at the bureau. He examined the two wounds and determined that they were likely caused by the blades of a ship. The deceased's face was sunken, and the eyeballs were missing beneath the eyelids, suggesting blindness. It was speculated that the cause of death was likely that she had fallen overboard while on a ship and been struck by the ship's blades, leading to drowning. As the deceased had no family, the bureau was instructed to collect the body and await identification.

### Apprentice Arrested for Extortion

Qu, a doctor at No. 93 Huanglu Road in Zhabei, received five threatening letters between the 4th and 12th of this month, demanding 2,000 yuan in legal tender. The letters were signed "Sheng, Shanghai College of Political Science," and contained inflammatory language. It was arranged that the money would be handed over at the entrance of a cigarette and paper shop on the same road at around 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Wu Peisheng, a detective from the Shanshi Police Station, arrested Lin Xianshang, a sixteen-year-old from Ningbo, who claimed to be an apprentice at the Yong'an Electrical Materials Store at No. 466 Haining Road. He said he was taking the money to a customer named Zhang Zixiang, who was a long-time customer of Wang. Detective Wu, along with detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, took the case to the police station to be handed over to the First Special Court for questioning.

### Robbery and Fierce Gunfight at Qiwupu Road

Dozens of Shots Fired; Resulting in One Dead, One Injured, and Two Arrested

Ge Xinshan from Ningbo, the owner of the Xingyu Weaving Factory, lived at No. 4 to 10, Lane 8593 (Shunji Lane), Qiwupu Road. Around 7:00 p.m. last night, while Ge's family was finishing their meal, six robbers suddenly broke in. Two robbers guarded the front and back doors, and four robbers entered the house. Only two of the robbers had pistols. They first restrained the men and women in the house and then went upstairs to rob. Unexpectedly, an apprentice who had not been noticed saw the robbers enter the house and slipped out the back door, running to the entrance of the lane to seek help. At that time, Chinese Constable No. 1717 was patrolling the area and the apprentice immediately reported the incident to him, who telegraphed the Yulin Road Police Station. The police station quickly dispatched Controller Liu Junqing, along with detectives Li Hongsheng, Liu Chunshu, Zhang Jingyu, Peng Zhenxuan, and Cai Zhitian, to the scene. The robbers were just emerging from the house after their plunder. They encountered each other at the entrance of the lane, leading to a fierce gunfight. Dozens of shots were fired, resulting in one robber being killed on the spot, one robber being injured, and two robbers being captured. Two pistols were seized, and the stolen goods were recovered. The remaining two robbers escaped. The two injured and dead robbers were sent to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. The remaining criminals were taken to the police station for questioning. They confessed their names as Shen A'er and Gu Jincai and admitted to conspiring to commit the robbery. They were ordered to be temporarily detained and handed over to the court for further investigation. The injured robber was said to be named Cai Yunqing. The stolen items included a gold bracelet, a gold watch, and over 100 yuan in legal tender.

### Robbers Zhou Qifu and Others Handed Over to the First Special Court for Trial

Also Committed Crimes in the Public Concession

Chinese and Western detectives from the French Police Station previously arrested robbers Zhou Qifu, Zhang Jinbiao, Qian Laowu, Wang Huaisheng, Wang Haishan, Zhang Shaoxing, Zhang Youshan, Yan Jinquan, Zhang Zhenliang, and nine others at No. 7 Ganzi Dong Road and other locations in the French Concession. They confiscated two pistols and one fake pistol. It was discovered that these men had committed several robbery cases in the French Concession, and they were handed over to the Second Special Court for separate punishments. Now, the Gordon Road Police Station has discovered that Zhou Qifu and others also committed a crime in the Public Concession on the night of January 21st of this year at 7:30 p.m., robbing Tang Youguang's house at No. 22, Lane 600, Route Connaught, of over 100 yuan in property. They requested and received approval from the Second Special Court to transfer Zhou and the other nine, along with the pistols, to the First Special Court's Eighth Criminal Court yesterday morning. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Police Station presented the case and requested permission for detention to allow the Police Station to investigate. Yang Yunlong, a relative of Tang Youguang, also complained about the circumstances of the robbery. Judge Fu Lin verified the confession and ordered that the defendants be detained and rescheduled for trial in seven days.

### Yang Qingchang Firmly Refuses to Return Home

Gentle Wife and Weak Younger Sister's Efforts Fail; Check Lawsuit Still Requires Testimony

Yang Qingchang, the youngest son of the late former Zhejiang military governor Yang Shande, has been indulging in dance halls for years since marrying Zheng Fengying, a woman from his hometown of Anhui. Zheng repeatedly advised him to change his ways, but he did not listen. Recently, he became involved with the dance star Tang Xiangying. Zheng sued him for adultery in the Second Special Court, which sentenced Yang to three months in prison, but he was allowed to commute the sentence by paying a fine. However, in January of this year, when Yang repaid his wife's debt, he issued a check for 13,000 yuan from the China Industrial Bank. When Zheng tried to cash the check at the bank, Yang had stopped payment and petitioned the First Special District Court to declare the check invalid, claiming that Zheng had stolen the check. Zheng also filed a lawsuit against Yang to confirm her ownership of the check. After one hearing was held, with the defendant Yang Qingchang failing to appear, the plaintiff Zheng Fengying clearly stated that her husband had used the check to offset debts. The hearing was adjourned to yesterday afternoon, when Judge Xu continued the hearing. Yang Qingchang had complied with the summons and appeared in court. He testified that the check was taken from his hands by the plaintiff in the office of a Peng, an employee of Qiatoon & Co., and was not to repay the debt of the plaintiff. Because Zheng Fengying had submitted a written repentance letter stating that she would no longer engage in pleasure seeking during the previous court hearing, the plaintiff's representative lawyer requested that the court inquire about this point to see if Yang would deny it. Judge Xu announced that the case would be rescheduled for April 20th for further testimony. After Zheng Fengying left the courtroom, she saw her husband, who had not been home for a long time, and did not care about the death of their beloved daughter the previous month. He saw his family as just a temporary abode and his wife and children as strangers. Now that they were in court, they finally met, so she asked her father and younger sister, who were waiting outside the court, to persuade Yang to return home and not waste his energy and money wandering outside. However, Yang Qingchang refused to listen. No matter how strongly his father-in-law, gentle wife, and weak younger sister tried to persuade him, he refused them more and more resolutely. The entanglement lasted a long time, and the audience gathered. Under the mediation of the bailiffs, both sides separated.

### Two Cars Collide

Yesterday afternoon around 2 PM, a rented car (license number 18283) from the Silver Fish Automobile Company at 405 Gordon Road was returning empty to the company after dropping off a customer somewhere downtown.

Both vehicles were damaged and unable to move, and both drivers were injured. Nearby police officers arrived and sent both drivers to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. It is said that the driver of the Silver Fish Automobile Company, Chen Xiaocai, a native of Ningbo, was seriously injured.

The term of office for the second session of the Shanghai Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association has expired, and Chairman Gan Dounan has repeatedly proposed resigning due to public and private matters and the inability to manage the association's affairs, in order to avoid delaying the overall situation. Therefore, the Standing Committee resolved to convene a spring general meeting of members at 1 PM on the 15th of this month (today) at the Zhimeilou Restaurant on Fourth Road to re-elect the third session of officers according to law. In addition to having already submitted reports to the party and government organs for approval to send personnel to attend for guidance and notifying all members to attend the grand event on time, letters have also been sent to urge all factories that have not yet joined the association to join according to law in order to seek solid unity. It is also heard that the former chairman of the association, Meng Haowu, and the current chairman, Gan Dounan, are both extremely loyal to their duties, especially in terms of the progress of the association and the public welfare of the industry, and have worked tirelessly to handle them, and have therefore won the praise of all members. As the two gentlemen cannot be re-elected as executive committee members according to law in this re-election, all members intend to take advantage of the general meeting to hold a banquet to thank them for their service and express their gratitude.

### Azalea

— Liao Chuxiu

After finishing lunch, I lay down at the white-clad nurse's urging. The sky was exceptionally clear, and the spring breeze blew in through the gauze window, gently caressing my cheeks. In the wind, I smelled the fragrance of rapeseed flowers.

So I quickly lingered on the edge of sleep and wakefulness. Suddenly, a burst of crying came urgently, causing me to quickly get out of bed and put on my clothes. Looking out the window, on a slope near the hospital, a woman was sitting on a grave, wailing and crying, and the smoke from burning paper rose straight up. I thought that it was currently the Qingming Festival for sweeping graves. "Paper ashes fly as white butterflies, blood and tears dye red azaleas," and then I remembered the Tang poet's verse. I raised my head suddenly and saw that on the small mountain where the hospital was located, there was a mountain of azaleas in bloom. It was only because I usually looked into the distance from the window that I had overlooked them.

The azalea herbal says, "Also known as red rhododendron, also known as mountain pomegranate, also known as yingshanhong, found everywhere in mountain valleys. The tall ones are four or five feet high, and the short ones are one or two feet high. The seedlings and leaves emerge in spring and are light green. The branches are few and the flowers are abundant, with several flowers on one branch, and the flowers begin to bloom in February. The flowers are like sheep rhododendron, but the calyx is like pomegranate flowers." The Yongzhuang Mountain Flora says, "Azaleas bloom in February and March when the cuckoo cries, there are two types: one that sprouts leaves first and then flowers, with a color as red as blood; the other that flowers first and then sprouts leaves, with a lighter color." But the Xitai Chronicle says, "Recently, it has also been said that those that sprout leaves first and then flower are called 'shiyan' to distinguish them. However, the ancients only called them red rhododendron, and it is not known when the name 'shiyan' originated. Today, Jiangnan calls them 'shiyan' in the Ma Zhong area. The description in Ai Bin's Village Chronicle is not entirely accurate. People in the Tan Zhi region not only do not call them 'shiyan', but also do not call them azaleas, but call them yingshanhong. Xuepu Chutan says, "The red flowers are called azaleas, and those with small, bright red, and dense flowers are called shiyan." Then, the azalea and the shiyan are both different flowers.

According to the legend of the origin of azaleas, they are the soul of Emperor Wang, transformed into cuckoos, and their blood enters the earth, transforming into azaleas. The color of azaleas is as red as blood, which is very easy to associate with blood and tears. Therefore, someone has the verse "Outside the blood, a thousand-year-old emperor's flower."

The Herbal Spectrum says, "Azaleas from Sichuan are the best, called Sichuan azaleas, with more than ten layers of flowers, and the color is very red. Those from Siming have two or three layers of flowers, and the color is light." Emperor Wang was from Sichuan, so cuckoos are also called Sichuan souls, and azaleas from Sichuan are also considered the best. Then, it is natural to have a close association between them, the cuckoo, and Emperor Wang. In a poem that combines azaleas and cuckoos, we see a poem by Cheng Yanhong that says, "Azalea and bird, resentment and beauty, what a extravagance, I suspect it is blood from the mouth, dripping into flowers on the branch, a sound on Hanshi Night: several flowers in a wild monk's home, Xie Chai comes out or not, the day is late and slanting again."

In fact, who can use their limited, pathetic literary skills to describe the desolation of "azaleas falling, cuckoos crying"? The setting sun is like a dream, the willows are like smoke. In a quiet, uninhabited mountain, blood-like azaleas fall all over the ground. When the flowers fall, there is no more bright red on the branches; they are tinged with purple, reminding people of lung blood that has been vomited for an hour or two. At that time, if you wander alone, you will definitely feel bone-deep desolation, and you will definitely feel your soul slowly loosening and dissolving: Just when it is about to dissipate, suddenly, from the other side of a mountain ridge, comes a loud cuckoo cry, followed by another and another. It is like a whip of spirit, lashing your soul, causing your almost exhausted soul to suddenly congeal. Then, you suddenly wake up from the power of the anesthetic, and feel the pain of the wound even more clearly. And just when you are overcome with sorrow, this cuckoo bird quickly sweeps over your head and flies to a distant grove. The further it flies, the more faint the call becomes, and so it leads you into a semi-drunken state.

### Hell in Heaven

— Shui Mo

— Recording Changmen.

Late at night, like wandering souls, we turned from the main street into a dark alley. In the alley, faint lights flickered, and in the darkness, a noisy sound floated out. Groups of girls, like ghosts, crowded together on both sides. In the dim light, their faces, covered with heavy makeup, were revealed. Each of them wore ill-fitting clothes with red and green patterns. Behind them stood their masters, the madams, pushing them to pull at the sleeves of passersby...

We groped in the darkness. In front of us, a slender shadow seemed to flash. We followed it curiously. The dark shadow disappeared into a pitch-black alley. When we ran into the alley, on the threshold of a shikumen house with light shining out, a woman wearing a cloak leaned there, deliberately speaking softly and coquettishly to the people in the room. We ran past her and out of the alley, but she followed us reluctantly, showing such disappointment.

In alley after alley, the lanterns of bathhouses, the door lights of late-night snack shops, the signs of small hotels flickered... We turned to a strange glass door with a sign nailed on it that read "× District Opium Den." A lantern with the words "Luyuan" lit up above the door. Standing in front of the door, we imagined the scene inside—this garden must be full of people as thin as firewood, the turbid atmosphere, the opium poppy juice, devouring people's bone marrow. This made me think of the clear, stern slogan of executing smokers on the Golden Gate city wall, which was close to this place.

We ran to the area called Duck Egg Bridge by the down-and-out beggars. We ran from this alley to that alley. We saw a house with the word "Villa" written on it. In the quiet alley, several girls returning from business trips twisted their bodies and ran into the house. Beside the black door of that house, we clearly saw a piece of paper pasted with the words "Baojia Chief's Office."

When we ran across a small bridge, on the side of the cobblestone street, there was a row of alleys. The alleys were full of red lights, a long, rectangular glass lamp emitting an alluring red light, with the words: "Dragon and Phoenix Class," "Intimate Class," "Remembrance Class,"...

As if in a dream, we rushed into a "class" and were led to the boudoir of a girl named Xiang Yuan. That girl

Talking Point

### Further Discussion on "Banning Workers from Going Abroad"

— Fang Kewen

After writing "Banning Workers from Going Abroad," I felt that I hadn't fully expressed myself, so I wanted to write a few more words.

Abyssinia is now considered a territory of "civilized" Italy, but it is far from being "conquered." Although civilized poison gas can wipe out the lives and property of the savage Abyssinians, it is not easy to make them prostrate themselves and shout "Emperor is wise, I deserve to be punished," except for a few Abyssinian traitors. Even with repeated massacres, it is still the same.

So it is necessary to use civilization. And in order for this colony to be beneficial to him, it must be built up, for example, by reclaiming wasteland and building something on it, so that there can be some modern facilities, which are convenient for developing resources and also allow the savage Abyssinians to approach a little material civilization. And while enjoying "civilization," they cannot help but have a little good feeling towards the conquerors. Once there is a good feeling, that is what is called "friendship," then "cooperation," etc., will be much easier to carry out. Didn't you see that when the first Italian film was shown in Abyssinia, the savage Abyssinians poured into the streets to watch it?

However, to "befriend" is not easy at first. Although there are often white heroes in movies who go to the barren lands of the savages to reclaim land and return with merit, there must always be a few "selflessly devoted and dying only after fulfilling their duty" locals as guides. Those guides can not only enter the mountains to capture tigers and enter the water to kill dragons, but also make the savage blacks obey their orders and dare not resist. In this way, the white heroes can pass safely, and after making meritorious service, they can also have a "grand reunion" with the beauty. But now, although there are many indigenous "Abyssinian traitors," unfortunately, their true faces have been exposed. Since the masks have been torn off, it is impossible to make the people obey their orders again. So even if there are white heroes who have the ambition to be guides, they have in fact lost the qualification. This is slightly different from the fact that white heroes in movies only need a few loyal guides to make meritorious service and return.

Of course, it can also come with another set of "civilization" and "befriend" under the cannon, but this is ultimately a bit too hard for the way of friendship. What's more, the problem is not just these. For example, under the cannon, who are the workers who reclaim the wasteland?

So they thought of using foreign workers, and among foreign workers, none is better than Chinese workers, who have low wages and are able to endure hardship and hard work. So the "preferential" method of "half-price ship tickets" was stipulated, and "large numbers of rogues" also appeared one after another in "various coastal areas of Wenzhou, propagating the ease of earning money and the comfort of life in Europe."

Based on this, the rogues' claim that "Italians are sending people to Abyssinia to reclaim wasteland, and huge wages can be earned" is probably the same as the gentry's claim in their memorial that "After these workers go abroad, they will either be stranded in foreign lands or marry and have children and live overseas for a long time," both of which have a reliable side, and both have an unfulfilled side. The unreliable aspect of the former is the "huge" amount of wages: and the latter, in addition to "being stranded" and "marrying and having children," there is also another path of "being sent back home." Although, as it seems now, being sent back will probably be after "civilization" has worked hard to stabilize in the "savage" areas.

For example, the recent situation of overseas Chinese in the South Seas islands is clear evidence.

With long hair and colorful clothes, she looked flustered, and shouted to the madam to buy a pack of cigarettes.

The girl treated us warmly and slowly recounted her tragic life. She said that she had only been sold here from the countryside four months ago, that her body belonged to the madam; she said that business was slow, and if there were no double customers, an unusual, heavy sorrow would appear on her face with sparse freckles.

She complained mournfully, her lips moving, as if resenting and sighing at the pain of the past few months. On her smiling face, the deep pain of a ravaged person appeared.

In this place to seek happiness, we felt gloomy. We seemed to see women being dragged into this hell without sunlight, without spring, without warmth, being brutally trampled on year after year, until they were devastated and dying at the end of their lives, just like a flower that was crushed before it could bloom.

It was late at night. When we ran out of the "class," the girls in each alley strolled to the alley entrance, their eyes cast on the street, forced to endure a tragic fate.
