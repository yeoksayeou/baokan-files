### Central Memorial Week: Wang Chonghui Reports on Diplomatic Policy

Handling Matters Based on Established Principles, Emphasizing the Foundation of Mutual Benefit and Equality, Recognizing the True Meaning of Cooperation

[Nanjing] Wang Chonghui gave a report at the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 5th. The original text is as follows: "Fellow comrades, what I want to report today is a simple overview of China's historical attitude towards foreign countries. We are a nation with the earliest civilization. To all countries in the world, there is no distinction between 'central' and 'foreign'; as the saying goes, 'all within the four seas are brothers.' This attitude is very open and aboveboard. During the Tang Dynasty, foreigners came to China to spread religion and trade. The Great Tang Nestorian Stele, which still exists in Xi'an, records the situation at that time in great detail. During the Yuan Dynasty, the Italian Marco Polo came to China to travel. We not only treated him as a Chinese, but also gave him an official position in the court. By the Ming Dynasty, even more foreigners came to China to travel. Xu Guangqi, a minister of the Ming Dynasty, was a Catholic and wrote extensively. In his writings, one can see the close relationship he had with foreigners at that time. Therefore, China's historical attitude towards foreign relations has always been very generous. After the Manchus entered the Pass, their attitude towards foreign countries gradually changed. At that time, the Manchus looked down on foreigners. All official foreign affairs were conducted with imperial edicts. After the defeat in the Opium War, the initial contempt turned into fear. The authorities in charge of foreign affairs all held a fearful attitude, only seeking not to offend foreigners. As a result, foreigners began to invade us, leading to our decline. To despise foreigners is certainly wrong, but to underestimate ourselves is even more wrong. Therefore, the Premier advocated the principle of equality and mutual benefit to seek progress with all countries. The Premier once said, 'When two countries meet, it is like two people interacting. Sometimes one must sacrifice one's own interests to benefit others, and sometimes one can benefit oneself without harming others. Choosing the path of benefiting oneself without harming others is how diplomatic means can achieve their purpose.' This is the essence of equality and mutual benefit. Recently, the international rhetoric of 'economic cooperation' and 'economic partnership' has become a popular trend. But so-called cooperation should be reciprocal. Cooperation that shackles the hands and feet of others cannot be called cooperation. So-called partnership means that both sides unite. One person cannot be called a partner. Doing things only for one's own side is not cooperation, but rather acting alone. Our diplomatic stance has been clearly stated in the central government's various declarations. Under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, we sincerely hope to increase international relations with all countries in the world. If a country wants to raise its international standing, it must resolutely fight for it. As long as we have the determination to build the nation and strengthen national defense, we will surely succeed. One day, we will achieve the free and equal status that the Premier hoped China should have." (Central Telegram on the 5th)

Wang Chonghui presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Wang Chonghui gave a speech stating that China has always been extremely kind and friendly to friendly nations, as our ancestors said, "All within the four seas are brothers." The Chinese people all believe in this. At present, our country should also treat friendly nations in accordance with our inherent spirit and on the principle of equality. If cooperation and partnership are mentioned without equality as a foundation, it is impossible. Our country's current diplomatic policy should be handled in accordance with the principles established by the central government. After Wang's speech, the ceremony concluded and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 5th)

In addition to reviewing committee reports and passing eight proposals, three principles were amended and approved on how to realize "land to the tiller," according to the draft resolution proposed by the presidium: 1. The government should issue land bonds, first requisitioning land from absentee landlords and then farmland not cultivated by the owners themselves to create self-farming farms; 2. Self-farming farms should, according to local conditions and types of farmland, stipulate appropriate sizes, prohibit division or transfer to non-cultivators, and limit their maximum debt; 3. The development of wasteland, the improvement and re-division of cultivated land, the implementation of land value taxation, the establishment of land banks, and the promotion of rural cooperatives are all necessary means for the creation and maintenance of self-farming farms and should be implemented immediately.

Current Commentary

### Foreign Minister Wang Reports on Diplomatic Policy

— Appropriate

Since the return of the Kodama mission to Japan, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation seems to have stalled again. Foreign Minister Wang reported at the Central Memorial Week yesterday, "Our country should treat friendly nations with equality as the principle. Cooperation and collaboration without equality as the foundation is impossible." This is clearly aimed at the current Sino-Japanese economic cooperation issue.

Economic cooperation is a link in the issue of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. If relations between the two countries cannot be improved in the political and military aspects, economic cooperation cannot be discussed. However, China, as Foreign Minister Wang said, is a country with the ideal of "all men are brothers within the four seas." We are willing to make the greatest efforts for international peace. Therefore, when Japanese Foreign Minister Sato first announced that he would abandon the concept of superiority over China and conduct equal diplomacy with China from a new starting point, we sincerely hoped that this statement could be fully realized. We also gave the Kodama mission a warm welcome when it came to China.

However, the trend of Japanese politics has not improved. The evolution of facts proves that the Hayashi Cabinet is even more fascist than the Hirota Cabinet. Foreign Minister Sato, in answering questions from members of parliament, still adheres to the Three Principles and, regarding the Open Door Policy, stated that it does not include North China. This simply cancels all the declarations he made when he took office. Talking about economic cooperation under such circumstances is still nothing more than the old trick of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." Unless our country is willing to become a colony, such cooperation is certainly impossible.

We still remember Foreign Minister Wang's talk to the press when he first took office. He said, "To promote cooperation, we must pay attention to the emotions between the people. We should first strive to eliminate or prevent anything that hinders goodwill between the two sides." This remark indeed points out the key to Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. We firmly believe that the majority of the Japanese people hope to maintain international peace and promote international cooperation. We can see some of this from the recent dissolution turmoil in the Japanese House of Representatives. However, the problem now lies in the fact that the Japanese military, who are in charge of the political hub, continue to obstruct the path of peace and cooperation. The rampant smuggling and drug trafficking and the activities of the Japanese army and navy in Hebei and Shandong are clear evidence that the old obstacles have not been removed for a single day, and cooperation and collaboration are less possible. What's more, new obstacles seem to be increasing.

### Another Big Prison Case in the Soviet Union: Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Yakoda Dismissed and Investigated

Formerly Served as Minister of Political Police, Prominent in Various Cases

[Moscow] The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union resolved that Yagoda, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, should be dismissed and handed over to the inspection agency for investigation for violating his duties. (TASS telegram, 4th)

[Moscow] Yagoda, the Soviet Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, was recently dismissed for breach of duty. He once served as the Minister of Political Police. He gained great fame in the British engineers sabotage case. He also played a prominent role in the recent Zinoviev Great Party Prison case. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 4th)

⊙Warsaw According to a telegram from Moscow, the Soviet Union has appointed General Gamarnik as the political commissar of the party army. The work of the political committee in the army is to examine the political views of officers at all levels, monitor the actions of cunning elements, and suppress counter-revolutionary activities. The appointment of this committee is believed to be related to the infighting among Moscow military and political authorities. (National Maritime Telegram, 5th)

[Paris] Le Matin recently published a telegram from London stating that Yezhov, director of the Soviet political police, recently accused some military officers of participating in Trotskyist activities. Marshal Voroshilov, People's Commissar of Military Affairs, protested to Stalin because of this. It is reported that the Red Army General Staff asked Voroshilov to demand Stalin to: ① The political police should not conduct surveillance on the army in the future; ② The report submitted by the political training personnel of the army should be submitted directly to the General Staff, not to the political police; ③ Three officers from the General Staff should participate in the Soviet National Defense Committee; ④ Establish a new agency to monitor the army. Before the appointment of the agency's personnel, the consent of the General Staff must be obtained; ⑤ Yezhov, the director of the political police, should be replaced. Although Marshal Voroshilov did not accept the above request at the time, he tried his best to explain to Stalin that Yezhov's slander of the army would demoralize the army when he met with Stalin. (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)

[Tokyo] Hiroshima, an aide to the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union, was recently transferred to the Japanese Embassy in Warsaw. It is alleged in Moscow that Hiroshima was a key figure in the high treason case that opened in Tokyo in January. Today, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed this statement as absurd. Hiroshima was transferred from London to the Russian capital a year ago to serve as an aide. The so-called five years of service as a secretary in the Russian capital is completely untrue. His recent transfer to Warsaw is partly because the Japanese embassy in Poland will soon be upgraded to an embassy, and the service personnel need to be increased, and partly because the office personnel of the Japanese embassy in Russia are being reorganized.

### Constitutional Democratic Party and Government Begin Election Rhetoric War

Two Major Parties Cooperate to Fight a Do-or-Die Battle, Impeachment Motion Will Be Filed Immediately After Winning the General Election

[Tokyo] The number of candidates for national assemblymen reached 159 on the 4th, including 54 from the Constitutional Democratic Party and 38 from the Seiyukai. In the future, these two major parties will continue to maintain an overwhelming majority of candidates. Fearing that candidates from its own party will stand indiscriminately, the Constitutional Democratic Party intends to dispatch election personnel, limiting the number to 260 to 270 people. The Seiyukai also limits the number to around 250 people for the same reason. The Constitutional Democratic Party has now settled its relationship with the government and intends to declare war on the government at the joint meeting of the Constitutional Democratic Party and the Seiyukai on the 5th. Although there are various opinions within the Seiyukai, the general trend is to fight the government. With this attitude, the two parties will inevitably win an overwhelming majority of parliamentarians in the election war. Then, when the special parliament opens, there is no doubt that the Constitutional Democratic Party and the Seiyukai will jointly express no confidence in the cabinet and demand its resignation. (Domei News Agency, 5th)

[Tokyo] In order to express the party's attitude, the Constitutional Democratic Party convened a joint meeting of its members and councillors at Seiyo-ken in Ueno at 10:00 a.m. on the 5th. More than 500 people attended, and the atmosphere of overthrowing the current cabinet was very strong. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 p.m. President Machida and others gave speeches, the main points of which are recorded below: The government dissolved the parliament on its own, put aside the bills, and shifted the responsibility to the political parties. It is an extremely illegal act to deal with the people with the idea of bureaucratic selfishness. The reason why the bills are stagnant in the parliament is that the current cabinet has no foundation for political parties, and specialized ministers cannot be found. There are too many concurrent appointments and lack of functions. In just over forty days, it submitted as many as eighty bills, without considering urgency, importance, or triviality. It simply despises the parliament. The Hayashi Cabinet should be fully responsible for its serious responsibility. We and the people should resolutely impeach its unreasonableness. At this important time, if we want to implement important national policies, we should wait for the understanding and maintenance of the people. The current cabinet, which has no foundation for the people and no assistance from the parliament, cannot be implemented. Our party believes that a strong cabinet based on the will of the entire people can implement a policy of renewing all administrative affairs. In short, this dissolution of parliament is not to entrust important policies to the public judgment of the people, but to force the people with its narrow and selfish ideas, so the people's correct judgment will definitely not allow this illegal act. Our party engages in elections with the principles and propositions of righteousness and honesty, and believes that the true intentions of the entire people must be reflected in the parliament, and the current cabinet should of course obey the solemn judgment of the people. (Domei News Agency, 5th)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi's main points of the speech at the local governors' meeting on the 5th are as follows: The current cabinet takes manifesting the true form, enriching national defense, and expanding national power as the three major principles and attempts to implement innovative policies. The government dealt with the parliament with this policy, but because the cabinet was established during the parliament session, its term had to be shortened. The government, in view of the seriousness of the situation, exhausted its sincerity and hoped that the bills submitted to the parliament would be established. However, the deliberation of the House of Representatives lacked sincerity, and the political parties submitted a bill to amend the election law that would be beneficial to the political parties this year. This kind of behavior is difficult to be regarded as recognizing the important situation and contributing to constitutionalism. If we want Japan's constitutional government to develop, we sincerely hope that people who recognize the situation and sacrifice selfishness for the sake of the public will be elected as representatives. Under this meaning, the government dissolves the parliament and urges the political parties to be self-conscious in order to revitalize the parliament. We very much hope that this will be the step to manifest the essence of constitutional government and promote the people's political awareness. (Domei News Agency, 5th)

### French Newspaper Discusses China's Modernization

All Countries Are Friendly to China, Why Should European Commerce Be Overly Concerned?

[Paris] Romier, the manager of the right-wing Figaro, is currently inspecting the Far East. He recently sent an essay, which was published by the newspaper, entitled "What Impact Will China Have After It Transforms into a Modern Country?" The essay stated: "Countries previously showed friendliness to China because China itself had something to be friendly about. Now, they are friendly to China because they oppose Japan. Looking around the world, all countries that feel greedy about Japan's policies or are hindered by Japan are flattering China. Even Germany and Italy, which are usually close to Japan, are showing goodwill to China. China's prestige is increasing day by day. At this moment, the Chinese government is becoming stable and working hard on construction work, so that it can become a modern country. The people of the whole country also follow the government. From the perspective of the psychology of the majority of people in Europe and the United States, industrialization in China is what they want, but China is full of manpower, wages are extremely low, workers are hard-working and diligent, and their skills are excellent. Once industrialized, will there be any room for European commerce to develop?" (Havas, Central News Agency, 5th)

### Sino-American Aviation

Connecting with the Chinese Mainland

[San Francisco] The development plan of the Sino-American aviation line operated by American Airlines, which is about to begin, was announced today, stating that Portuguese Macau is the best base for South China because 25-ton flying boats cannot land in the Pearl River, and Hong Kong's position is too broad to be a suitable aviation base. However, it can be negotiated with the British government to make it a relay station, so that it can be connected with the aviation lines of Shanghai, various ports in mainland China, Vietnam, the British Malayan archipelago, and India. The line to Shanghai and mainland China will be operated jointly with China National Aviation Corporation. The Pacific aviation extension line is 715 miles from Manila to Macau, 40 miles from Macau to Hong Kong, and 680 miles from Hong Kong back to Manila. It only takes five and a half days to fly from San Francisco to Macau, while it takes 28 days by boat. (National Telegram, 4th)

### England and France Hope for US Intervention to Safeguard Peace

French Authorities Call for the Defense of Democracy – Japan Sends Representatives to Various Meetings

[London] European nations, alarmed by the deteriorating situation, generally desire the United States to intervene to maintain peace. Political figures openly admit that only US intervention can save the European situation. While the US has repeatedly denied that President Roosevelt has any international peace plan, diplomatic circles insist that US special envoy Davis will discuss MacDonald's peace conference plan when he meets with British Privy Council member MacDonald. MacDonald advocates that Britain and the League of Nations jointly initiate a peace conference, but only with the full support of the US. Other capitals are also echoing Britain today, hoping to end the US policy of isolation. French Undersecretary of State Taussaint gave a radio address, emphasizing that France and the US share common interests and urged peace-loving countries to unite. Germany and Italy are also very concerned about the US attitude, but both countries oppose convening any disarmament conference. (4th, National Telegram)

[Paris] Today marks the 20th anniversary of the US entry into the European War. Undersecretary of State Taussaint delivered a radio broadcast, stating that the late US President Wilson intended to place democracy on a rock-solid foundation. Today, France also advocates defending democracy and promotes the principle of "peace is indivisible," which coincides with the views of US President Roosevelt. "Any suggestion, any idea, no matter where it comes from, if based on the above spirit, our country will study it carefully. To adjust relations between countries and safeguard human freedom in a peaceful way, the sincere cooperation of all democratic countries is essential." (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas)

[Paris] Le Journal's London correspondent reports that the US chief representative to the World Sugar Conference, Davis, came to Britain this time with many economists and experts, which is by no means without purpose. "If Britain and France can resolve the war debt issue, the US intends to negotiate with these countries to establish commercial agreements based on reducing tariff barriers. In addition, if the British government's current tariff policy can be revised, the US also intends to accept concrete constraints on Britain. In other words, to clearly explain the actions and attitudes the US should take in the event of a European crisis." (Central News Agency, 5th, Havas)

[Tokyo] Japan has now appointed representatives to various international conferences in Geneva and London and issued instructions. The International Sugar Conference convened in London on the 5th will be attended by Third Secretary Takaki of the Japanese Embassy in Britain as an observer. The International Refrigeration Association conference convened in Paris on the 9th will be attended by First Secretary Minoda of the Japanese Embassy in France. The Social Issues Advisory Committee convened in Geneva on the 15th will be attended by Minister Yokoyama to Egypt. The International Maritime Law Conference convened in Paris on May 18th will be attended by Second Secretary Nishimura of the Japanese Embassy in France. The Opium Advisory Committee to be held in Geneva on May 24th will also be attended by Minister Yokoyama to Egypt as representative. (5th, Allied Telegram)

### Quezon Advocates for Early Independence

To be Implemented by the End of Next Year or the Middle of the Following Year – US Army and Navy Attitudes Undecided

[Washington] Philippine President Quezon delivered a radio broadcast here today, vigorously defending his proposal to shorten the period of Philippine self-government and achieve complete independence earlier. He said that this plan could probably stabilize the commercial relations between the United States and the Philippines and increase the prosperity of the Philippines. If the United States and the Philippines can conclude a treaty based on his suggestions, investments in the Philippines can be safe and stable. Quezon also warned the Philippine sugar magnates that insisting on maintaining the status quo is tantamount to economic suicide. He is willing to obtain independence even if he must abandon the benefits of the US market. Quezon announced for the first time today that the proposed date of independence is the end of 1938 or July 4, 1939. He also announced the members of the expert committee to study the issue of early independence, namely Philippine Secretary of Justice Yulo, Philippine Representative to the United States Barredo, Philippine Congressional leaders Romero and Rosas, Manila capitalist Elizarde, and technical advisor Leeson, among others. US government departments now generally state that Quezon's visit to the US is very beneficial to the economic relations between the US and the Philippines, but there is still no progress on the issue of the international status of the Philippines. Some believe that the research of the expert committee will be convincing and may eventually lead to amending the Philippine Independence Act. However, given the current situation, the expert committee will probably focus on economic aspects as the main subject of discussion. The issues of the army and navy will not be mentioned for the time being until Quezon consults with Chief of Naval Operations Leahy and Chief of Staff of the Army Craig. The Associated Press learned from the most reliable sources that the Navy has not yet finalized its policy on the issue of future Philippine naval bases. The Army's plans are also very secret, but it is rumored that senior officers believe that the Philippines is a military burden. Critics say that US policy is currently hesitant, and it is unknown whether to follow the defense consolidation plan of US military advisor to the Philippines General MacArthur or the neutrality plan of the Philippine Independence Act. The State Department stated today that the government has not yet taken any steps to make the Philippines a permanently neutral country internationally. Fair-minded experts also do not believe that a neutrality treaty can guarantee the Philippines' international security after independence, so all parties have raised opinions on this point. However, everyone feels that if President Roosevelt could visit the Philippines to conduct an on-site inspection, it would help determine future policies. (4th, National Telegram)

### International Sugar Conference

Opening Ceremony Held

[London] Today is the opening day of the World Sugar Conference. The opening ceremony was held by Privy Council member MacDonald at the British Foreign Office. Twenty-two countries participated in the conference. Except for Italy, all sugar-producing countries in the world sent representatives. However, Japan only sent one observer. British sugar-producing colonies will be represented by representatives from the Colonial Office. The items for discussion include all economic issues related to sugar production, such as prices, production subsidies, incentive methods, quantities, and tariffs, all of which are under discussion. Before the European War, the total world sugar production was 20 million tons per year, but it has now increased to 30 million tons. The sugar price before the war was £10 per ton, which rose to £140 per ton during the European War, but has now fallen to £6.5. The current London conference may negotiate methods to limit production, but the British sugar-producing regions will definitely not agree to this proposal. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters)

[London] The purpose of this conference is to raise world sugar prices and to formulate regulations to prevent continued increases in production. Preliminary talks have recently been held between major countries, and the progress has been quite good. Therefore, it can be predicted that an understanding will be reached at the conference. Among the major countries, the production of countries such as the United States and France is sufficient for their own use. Other countries, such as China, Britain, and the Scandinavian Peninsula, are countries that import sugar. However, most of what these countries purchase is raw sugar, which is often re-exported after being refined. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas)

### France Implements 40-Hour Workweek

[Paris] Today is the day to start implementing a 40-hour workweek. All retail stores are closed, except for those managed by store owners and their families. Barbers take Mondays as their day off, so people in Paris cannot find a barber today. Several newspapers have raised their prices, partly due to the implementation of the 40-hour workweek. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters)

[Paris] The streets of the French capital will be unusually lively on Mondays in the future, just like on Sundays, because people will only work five days a week. Department stores and most small stores will be closed on Mondays. Banks and insurance companies will be closed on Saturdays. Small stores that do not hire clerks may also operate on Mondays.

### 6,000 Austrian Monarchists Hold Grand Mass

Crowds of People Outside the Church – Chanting Restoration Slogans

[Vienna] A grand mass was recently held in the city's cathedral for the late Emperor Charles of Austria-Hungary. Chancellor Schuschnigg, Undersecretary of Defense General Trina, former Imperial Army officers, many restorationists, and Archduke Eugen of the former Habsburg imperial family participated. After the ceremony, when Archduke Eugen left the church, the crowds on the street shouted "Long live our Emperor" and "Long live the Habsburg imperial family," with great enthusiasm. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas)

[Vienna] Today is the anniversary of Charles I, the last emperor of Austria-Hungary. There was a grand gathering here, the greatest restoration demonstration since the European War. Six thousand monarchists gathered in the Catholic church, and outside the church, there were even more restorationists, all holding the black and yellow Habsburg imperial flags. When Archduke Eugen came to the church door, the crowd shouted "Long live Prince Otto," the heir to the throne, and "We want Otto to be restored immediately." These restorationists then began to march, and traffic was cut off. However, the marchers were soon dispersed by the authorities. Charles I, the former Emperor of Austria-Hungary, ascended the throne on November 21, 1916, at the height of the European War. When the European War ended and the peace treaty was signed, he abdicated and left the country for Switzerland. The following month, he was formally dismissed by the Austrian Parliament. In 1921, he secretly left Switzerland, flew to Burgenland, and led troops into Hungary, attempting to restore the empire, but was eventually defeated near the Hungarian capital. In 1922, he died on the island of Madeira in Spain. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)

⊙ Lansing – Lewis, Chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, spoke to 1,000 Chrysler auto workers in front of the Governor's Office today, saying, "We demand a basis for resolving the labor strike, so that the capital side recognizes the labor side's right to organize a union and negotiate on behalf of the workers, but also so that the factory can operate normally and maintain the interests of shareholders." This speech is very important, because observers believe that Lewis previously recognized the United Auto Workers Union as the only organization representing all Chrysler factory workers, but now he is willing to submit this issue to arbitration. (4th, National Telegram)

[New York] Labor strikes in the auto industry in various places have gradually eased. For example, 12,000 workers at the Chevrolet auto factory are scheduled to resume work tomorrow. As for the Chrysler factory strike, the factory's general manager Chrysler, the chairman of the Industrial Improvement Association Lewis, and Michigan Governor Murphy have been negotiating for days, and an agreement has been reached in fact. Therefore, the 60,000 striking workers at the factory are expected to resume work this week. Currently, only the 6,000 striking workers at the Hudson auto factory in Detroit and the 2,200 striking workers at the REO auto factory in Lansing are still on strike.

### The Guangxi Army's Designation Changed to the Fifth Route Army

Li and Bai Sworn into Office – Nanning Headquarters Temporarily Not Abolished

Wuzhou Correspondence: After the Central Government appointed Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi as the commander and deputy commander of the Fifth Route Army, it also sent Cheng Qian to Guangxi. Cheng arrived in Guilin on the 31st of last month. Li Zongren and others were then sworn into office at the Guilin military headquarters on the 1st of this month. In addition to Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, Li Pinxian, Chief of Staff of the Fifth Route Army, and Cheng Qian, the swearing-in official, were also present. Observers included members of the Guangxi Provincial Party Headquarters, Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, and various department heads. Military representatives included various army, division, and brigade commanders, general commanders of district militia, and representatives of various mass organizations and schools, totaling more than a thousand people. The headquarters auditorium was decorated with flowers and national flags, and the atmosphere was solemn. The ceremony began at 9:00 AM, presided over by Cheng Qian, who led the ceremony. After Li Zongren and others read the oath, Cheng delivered a speech, stating that Commander Li and Deputy Commander Bai have always worked hard for the party and the country, which is known to the people of the country. Today, they are taking on new positions, and he hopes that the whole country will unite and work together to implement the Three Principles of the People, so as to complete the national revolution as soon as possible. At present, the country is in great difficulty. Internally, we must eliminate warlords and traitors, and externally, we must achieve freedom and equality. However, this requires a good government to implement nationalism, modern economic suggestions to achieve livelihood, and a unified command of the highest military organ to fight against foreign enemies. Today, Commander Li and Deputy Commander Bai take office, promoting national unity and seeking national liberation, which is truly admirable, etc. Next, Li Zongren replied, briefly describing the Fourth Group Army's past local salvation movement, which was responded to by the whole country. In the future, we should strengthen our strength so that the oppressed people can achieve freedom and equality as soon as possible, etc. After the speech, the ceremony was completed at about 11:00 AM, and a public banquet was held by the headquarters that evening. Various matters were discussed during the banquet. After Li Zongren and others took office, the original designation of the Fourth Group Army was changed to the Fifth Route Army on April 1, but the internal organization remained the same. It is divided into the Seventh and Forty-eighth Armies, each army commanding three divisions, plus one directly subordinate division. The personnel of the army and division commanders remain unchanged. The Seventh Army is commanded by Liao Lei, with Zhou Zuhuang as deputy commander and Li Qi as chief of staff, and commands the 170th Division commanded by Xu Qiming, the 171st Division commanded by Yang Junchang, and the 172nd Division commanded by Cheng Shufen. The Forty-eighth Army is commanded by Xia Wei, and commands the 173rd Division commanded by He Weizhen, the 174th Division commanded by Wang Zanbin, and the 175th Division commanded by Mo Shujie. The 176th Division commanded by Qu Shounian is a directly subordinate unit. The Guangxi army's military expenditure has always been insufficient. The central government has assisted with 400,000 yuan per month, but it still feels exhausted. It is planned to request the central government to allocate an additional 200,000 yuan to avoid difficulties in coping. After the headquarters moved to Guilin, the Nanning headquarters was originally planned to be abolished, but due to the recent military conference, it was considered that there was still a need to preserve it, so the headquarters still exists.

### Guo Wei Accused of Murder in His Hometown

Guo Formerly Served as the President of the Jiangdu Court. Yi Benshen Petitions the Authorities for Strict Apprehension.

Changning Correspondence: Guo Wei, styled Xiangchu, a native of this county, previously abused his authority as the head of the local defense bureau in his hometown to murder Yang Chaoheng, a Hunan Provincial Assemblyman; Yi Rongfu, a secretary of the Hunan Auditing Bureau; and peasant Lei Yangxuan, among others. The victims' families, noting that there was neither an accusation of a crime nor a trial or approved submission, and that after the killings, there was no announcement of the charges or report for record, repeatedly petitioned for investigation and prosecution. Although Hunan Commander-in-Chief Tan Yankai in 1920 and Hunan Civil Affairs Director Feng Tianzhu in 1926, as well as the county government of this county, successively issued arrest warrants, Guo fled to Shanghai, using the alias Guo Yuanjue, earning a living as a scribe. Later, he resumed using the name Guo Wei, taking positions as a university lecturer and practicing law. The victims' families, isolated in Hunan, had limited knowledge and were unaware. Last year, when Guo was appointed President of the Jiangdu District Court, it came to the attention of Yi Benshen, son of Yi Rongfu. Yi Benshen, currently studying at Changsha Senior High School, spurred on by Zheng Jicheng and Shi Jianqiao's examples of avenging their fathers' deaths, never forgot his grievance. He immediately submitted petitions to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Control Yuan, requesting secret orders for investigation and handling. The Ministry of Judicial Administration subsequently received a reply from the Hunan Provincial High Court, stating that Guo Wei was sued for murder in 1918 in his hometown of Changning County and the case was not yet concluded, which was indeed true. It immediately issued an order to the Changning County Magistrate, urging him to resolve the matter promptly according to law. However, Guo Wei, having only served as President of the Jiangdu District Court for two months, immediately abandoned his post and fled upon hearing the news. It is recently learned that Yi Benshen and others, in addition to submitting petitions to the Judicial Affairs Office of this county to issue documents to Shanghai and the judicial authorities of various provinces and cities for strict apprehension, are personally tracking and identifying him with the aim of capturing him and redressing the injustice.

### Loan Allocation Commences in Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces' Black Tea Production Areas

First Batch of New Tea to be Shipped to Shanghai by Month's End; Anhui Western Tea to Also be Improved

Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Black Tea, since the implementation of unified control and sales last year, has benefited both tea merchants and tea farmers. The unified sales resulted in profits of over one million yuan. This year's black tea harvest is about half a month earlier than last year, and the selection, processing, and sales aspects have also been greatly improved. According to reliable information, the black tea from both provinces will be available around the 20th of this month and the first batch of new goods is scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai by the end of the month for overseas sales. Cheng Zhenji, the head of the Anhui Provincial Bank and manager of the Shanghai General Transportation and Sales Office, traveled to Shanghai on the 3rd to jointly oversee the transportation and sales with personnel dispatched by Jiangxi. It is expected that this year's sales volume will increase. Regarding loans for black tea in the two provinces, the Shanghai Bank of Communications is solely responsible for 1.9 million yuan, while the Anhui Provincial Bank and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank each handle 300,000 yuan. The arrangements have been agreed upon early and the contracts have been signed. All black tea merchants within the two provinces have completed registration with the production area management office. The Bank of Communications has specially dispatched Assistant Manager Zhao Ziqing and Commissioner Wu Linbai to Qimen and Xiushui to commence loan disbursements. The Anhui Construction Department has also sent Section Chief Xia Gengying and others to inspect the production area. Xia will proceed directly to Qimen after hosting the Beijing-Yunnan Highway tour group in Wuhu. In addition, green tea produced in various parts of northern and southern Anhui is also being picked one after another. Tea merchants are temporarily hiring workers to intensify tea production, and tea merchants from major ports have also arrived in the production area one after another to negotiate purchases, bringing large amounts of funds to lend to various tea merchants. This year's transportation routes will still involve southern tea being shipped out via the Wuhu-Tunxi and Beijing-Wuhu routes, while northern tea will be transported via Bengbu and handed over to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway for transport. The Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau has ordered the Wuhu-Tunxi Highway Vehicle Management Office to quickly repair and equip vehicles in preparation for tea transportation.

Furthermore, the tea produced in western Anhui will be thoroughly improved this summer. The Huoshan County Chamber of Commerce and Tea Trade Association previously requested the Construction Department to order the Qimen Tea Farm to send personnel to provide guidance during the tea season. The department has instructed the farm to reply, stating that the improvement of tea in western Anhui has been comprehensively planned, and it is proposed to cooperate with the tea trade associations of the three counties of Lu'an, Huoshan, and Jinzhai starting from this year's summer tea. A summary of the main points of the cooperation method has been extracted and submitted for approval. As the proposed method is feasible, it has been ordered to quickly finalize a formal contract with the tea trade associations of the respective counties, and to review and prepare a budget for submission to the department for approval and compliance (4th).

### Kunshan

Three Drowned in Capsized Boat

A ferry boat is provided at Guanlou River, Weizhou Township, Zhou Shu District, the eighth district of this county, to facilitate the villagers. At about 8:00 AM on the 3rd, the ferry boat was carrying three passengers. As the oarsman rowed, the boat reached the middle of the river when it was attacked by the wind. As the river surface was vast, the ferry boat capsized immediately and all the passengers fell into the river. Because there was no one to rescue them, they tragically drowned. After being discovered by nearby villagers, methods were devised to salvage the bodies and report to the police station in charge, which forwarded a telegram to the county government to send personnel for inspection. It is learned that the deceased were farmers Tang Bingqing, Tang Asan, and Wang Baosheng.

Peasant Woman Commits Suicide by Stabbing Throat

The mound is the burial site of 78 martyrs who died in the January 28th Incident. The scene was particularly tragic.

### Taicang

Villagers and Militia Brawl at Liudu Bridge

Over a hundred militia trainees from the Central People's School in the first district marched to Liudu Bridge town on the 3rd, led by acting principal Gao Xiangyun. Feng Daquan, a resident of the town, made disrespectful remarks, causing public outrage among all the militia trainees. The townspeople, hearing the news, came to help, and a brawl ensued. Businesses closed their doors. Fortunately, Ni Zanwen, an assistant from the First District Office, was in the town to review household registration and rushed to mediate. He advised the merchants to reopen. Wang Baoqing, Gu Fenglin, and six other injured trainees from the Central People's School were transported to the county hospital for treatment. Feng Daquan, the instigator, was taken into custody by the Public Security Bureau but was bailed out that same day. On the afternoon of the 4th, Xing Shuren, the town leader of Liudu Bridge, also led injured townspeople Ling Baoen and Sun Zhaoliang to the city for medical treatment and reported the incident to the District Office. The authorities are currently investigating the truth to make a decision.

### Changshu

Three-County Joint Power Generation

Recently, the Electric Company of this county has been expanding its rural lines, frequently causing operational disputes with neighboring county power plants. The electric companies in neighboring counties and various townships in this county also act independently, resulting in frequent chaos in electricity transmission and pricing. Recently, the company of this county has been actively seeking ways to unify, and Engineer Huang has traveled to Kunshan and Taicang counties to discuss the organization of a joint power plant. Both counties have expressed their support, and the factory of this county has been designated to take charge. After submission to the Construction Committee for approval, work will commence on installing three 2,500-kilowatt turbine generators at a central location in the three counties (either Renyang or Lishi). From then on, the electricity for Changshu, Kunshan, and Taicang counties will be supplied by this location. The capital of the power plant is estimated at 500,000 yuan, which will be raised by the power plants of the three counties.

### Wuxi

Re-dividing Police Precincts

Previously, the city area police stations and water police teams of this county had divided the area into 176 police precincts and assigned student police to manage them. However, recently, the city area baojia (neighborhood units) have been reorganized, and the police precincts of each police station have also been re-divided according to the newly reorganized bao. As of the 5th, with the exception of the first police station which has not yet completed the division, the second police station has been divided into 29 police precincts, totaling 10,748 households with a population of 50,350 men and women. The third police station has been divided into 44 police precincts, totaling 15,515 households with a population of 89,377 men and women. The fourth police station has been divided into 29 police precincts, totaling 10,150 households with a population of 41,898 men and women.

### Changzhou

County Government Strictly Pursues Outstanding Taxes

The Wu County government, noting that some townships still have outstanding old taxes and new levies that have not been paid, has instructed the second section chief Wang Yufu and others to supervise the police to go to the townships to strictly urge payment, with little effect. In recent days, summonses have been issued separately to detain over forty people, including the duty officer Zhao Zuze, to compel payment. Therefore, the office of the county government responsible for tax collection and police affairs has suddenly become overcrowded.

Two Memorial Ceremonies for National Heroes

The central government has designated Qingming Festival as National Tomb Sweeping Day. The Wu County Party and government organs, in order to commemorate the national heroes of past generations in this county, held ceremonies simultaneously at two locations at 10:00 AM this morning. One was at the tomb of Mr. Tang Jingchuan in the southern suburbs, presided over by the County Party Headquarters, and the other was at the pagoda of the robe of Monk Wan'an in the Provincial Changzhou Middle School, presided over by the County Government Chairman. Representatives from various organs, organizations, and schools participated, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

### Huaiyin

Demolition of the Cao Shu Wenchang Pavilion

Near the old Caohe Governor's Office, there stood a three-story pavilion inscribed with the words "Wenchang." The pavilion was purely covered with yellow glazed tiles and stood tall and distinctively in the west of Nanmen Street. Now that Huaiyin is building a through-city road from the north and south gates, the pavilion happens to be within the route of the road. The authorities originally tried every possible means to avoid it in order to preserve the ancient building, but unfortunately no good solution could be found. The county government then proposed to move the pavilion to the Nanmen schoolyard, using all the old materials and reconstructing it in the three-story flying eaves style. Bidding has already begun for demolition, and contractors are restricted from damaging more than a quarter of the raw materials, otherwise wages will be deducted.

### Bengbu

Sudden Increase in Salt Prices in the Market

The Ministry of Finance is currently conducting a national salt surcharge construction project, collecting one yuan per dan. The Bengbu Salt Affairs Tax Collection Office has been ordered to implement this, resulting in a sudden increase in the market price of salt from 9.4 yuan per dan to 10.4 yuan per dan. This places a heavier burden on consumers, which is unprecedented. The salt merchants here comply with the order and pay the tax, but have not expressed any opinion.

### Haizhou

Farmers Discover Ancient Coins

Yin Dabao, a resident of the fourth bao, Shangling Township, Yanjinanxi district, second district of Muyang County, discovered a string of ancient coins while cultivating his field in the lake at noon the other day. The coins had the words "Five Pearls Great Auspiciousness" on them, which he found very strange. He rushed to inform his family, and they dug with shovels, eventually unearthing five loads of baskets.

### Xiaoshan

Smallpox and Diphtheria are Rampant

Recently, the weather has been erratic, with uneven cold and heat, leading to the prevalence of diseases such as smallpox and diphtheria in the countryside. Dozens of children have died from smallpox. The spread is particularly severe in the Yiqiao, Xinba, and Wenyan areas. Although local doctors are vaccinating, patients often do not pay attention. Diphtheria is also spreading in Xiaocheng, with many middle-aged people and children being infected. Many Western doctors are unable to treat it, and there are few Chinese doctors who are proficient in throat diseases, so patients often mistakenly take medication and die.

▲First Meeting

The first meeting was held at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. ㊀ Secretary-General Bao Dezheng delivered a report. ㊁ An organizational proposal review committee was formed, with the presidium introducing Wan Guoding, Xiong Shouxing, Tang Qiyu, Li Qinglin, Zhang Tingxiu, Duan Shaowu, Wan Huangbin, Huang Gong’an, and Cai Dianrong as nine committee members, convened by Wan Guoding. ㊂ Group members gave reports: 1. Ministry of Interior; 2. Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Bureau; 3. Jiangxi Provincial Land Administration Bureau; 4. Hubei Provincial Land Administration Bureau; 5. Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs; 6. Henan Land Administration Bureau; 7. Hunan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs; 8. Nanjing Municipal Land Administration Bureau; 9. Pinghu County Government; 10. Qingdao Municipal Finance Bureau; 11. Land Administration College. ㊃ Members' research reports: 1. A comparison of the economic conditions of self-cultivating farmers and tenant farmers (Tang Huisun); 2. The land problem in Jiaxing County and its solutions (Wang Xianqiang); 3. An expansion of Ricardo's theory of rent (Huang Tong). ㊄ Provisional motions: Resolution 1: A special telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressing appreciation for his efforts for the country and supporting his land reform proposals. Resolution 2: A special telegram was sent to Chairman Wang Jingwei requesting adoption of the assembly's opinions. Resolution 3: A special telegram was sent to Mr. Chen Lifu, honorary director of the association, reporting on the opening of the annual meeting. The chairman delivered the opening address, stating in brief: The fourth annual meeting of the association is being held in Qingdao today. We are extremely grateful for the presence and guidance of all of you. The organization of the association, its establishment, the progress of various studies, and all related matters have been described in detail in the association's report. Regarding the association's discussion of China's land problem and the land reform movement, I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief report. The members of the association, whether engaged in academic research or practical administration, all adhere to the Three Principles of the People. The Principle of People's Livelihood, as proclaimed by the Premier, has two main aspects: 1. Equalization of land ownership; 2. Restriction of capital. China has no large capitalists; there is only a distinction between large and small poverty in society. Therefore, the restriction of capital only requires the development of national capital. As for the restriction of private capital, it only needs to be limited to a few cities, where social progress, transportation development, and land prices have risen sharply, and urban landlords have suddenly become rich. This restriction of capital is actually embedded within the equalization of land ownership. The association's attention to the land reform movement in recent years is precisely for this purpose. Members believe that to achieve the goal of equalization of land ownership, it is necessary to ㊀ eliminate the abuses arising from the existing land system and ㊁ establish a new land system that implements the Principle of People's Livelihood. Members believe that land currently in private hands should be taxed according to its land value, and the increased value due to social progress should be entirely public. As for farmers who have become tenants, the state should find ways to provide them with land and relocate them to border areas. This is the meaning of the Premier's "land to the tiller." Therefore, equalization of land ownership should at least be pursued from these two aspects to achieve the completion of the foundation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Before the establishment of this association, Liao Zhongkai, Hu Zhantang, Chiang Kai-shek, and others paid attention to the land problem. Among them, Mr. Chiang's enlightenment on the land problem was particularly significant. The Land Law, promulgated in the nineteenth year [of the Republic] as the fundamental law for solving the land problem, greatly inspired the members. Under the leadership of the advanced members of the party and the country, we have held two discussions on the Land Law, the Constitution, and the Implementation Law of the Land Law. The results of the discussions were presented to the central government. Therefore, the guidelines of the central government's land policy are the result of the painstaking research of the members. In addition, regarding administrative aspects, such as the National Land Survey by the Land Committee of the National General Assembly and the aerial survey plan of ten provinces, many contributions were made by members of this association. As for the Central Land Special Committee, its members are all members of this association who are rich in research. From the establishment of the Chinese Association of Land Administration to the present day, all the efforts made in academic and administrative fields have become the mission of the times. Although it has only been five years, as far as I know, the contributions made by various parties on the land problem are more than double what they were before the establishment of this association. Today, as we hold the annual meeting in Qingdao, we pledge to dedicate our efforts in research and struggle to the compatriots across the country. Qingdao has made considerable achievements in equalization of land ownership, which is worthy of our reference to verify our theories, so as to create a great land reform movement. In the past, the association paid more attention to the Southeast. Today, as we hold the annual meeting in Qingdao, we hope to use the results obtained from our efforts in the Southeast to irrigate North China, so that the land reform movement can flourish and spread throughout the country. We hope that you will not hesitate to give your advice. Next, Mayor Shen delivered a speech, followed by the association's report.

▲Second Meeting

The second meeting was held at 9:00 AM on the 4th, still at the preparatory office of the Taiping Road Museum. More than 70 individual and group members attended. The chairman was Tang Huisun, and the secretary-general was Bao Dezheng. 1. The secretary-general reported on the number of members who continued to arrive today and telegrams of congratulations from various parties. 2. Group members' reports: A. Qingdao Municipal Finance Bureau; B. Pinghu County Government. 3. Members' research reports: A. The land problem in Jiaxing County and its solutions (Wang Xianqiang); B. An expansion of Ricardo's theory of rent (Huang Tong). 4. Discussion: How to realize the goal of "Land to the Tiller." First, Wan Guoding explained the key points of how to realize "Land to the Tiller." Then, members expressed their personal opinions. Xiang Naiqi said that farmers should only have the right to use the land, not the right to own it, because the land area is actually not enough for distribution. From a management perspective, large-scale farming is also more advantageous than small-scale farming, and it is even more inconvenient to privatize the large-scale farming system. Tang Qiyu said that the tiller should have the right to own the land so that farmers can operate with peace of mind and strive to increase their income. If the tiller only has the right to use the land, the farmer will not have a close relationship with the land, and will neglect management, which will greatly affect production. Wang Xianqiang said that the Premier clearly taught that land should be publicly owned, so the permanent cultivation right of the tiller, that is, the right to use the land without the right to own it, does not hinder management, and only in this way can various plans for realizing "Land to the Tiller" be achieved. Xiong Shouxing agreed with Guo Hanwu's proposal to establish a land bank to help tenant farmers purchase land. Secondly, the tenancy system should be improved so that tenant farmers gradually become self-cultivating farmers. Ma Kaihua said that "Land to the Tiller" refers to the right of ownership. Now that the topic is "Realizing Land to the Tiller," the methods must be discussed in earnest. ㊀ Specify a standard area; ㊁ Prohibit resale; ㊂ Issue land bonds. Wan Guoding said that if the tiller has paid the land price but does not have the right of ownership, not only will he be unwilling, but he will also feel unfair. Even if it is feasible to transfer land without price, it will never be valuable. The future of rural areas is unimaginable. Currently, self-cultivating farmers account for seven-tenths of all farmers. If it is nationalized, it will have a great impact on the future of the country. Zheng Zhenyu said that after creating self-cultivating farmers, the law of permanent cultivation should be established. There is no obstacle if ownership is not granted, but there must be a practical and easy-to-implement content. Empty talk about national ownership and national operation is not desirable. It is best to gather small farmers into group farms, which are managed by agricultural cooperatives. Secondly, issuing land certificates is not as convenient and effective as issuing land bonds. The repayment period for land price certificates must be extended to suit the country's ability to bear the burden. Wei Shudong said that the tiller's right of ownership should be retained, but the tenancy system must be eliminated. Bao Dezheng said that only Soviet Russia has implemented land nationalization. Other countries cannot do it under the current situation. China has many self-cultivating farmers, and it is not feasible to implement nationalization. However, when the state levies land and distributes it to self-cultivating farmers, it should be restricted by law so that it cannot be transferred to the hands of landlords. Li Qinglin said that to equalize land ownership, it is necessary to first make full use of the land, not to deprive land ownership. If land ownership is nationalized, but other industries are not treated the same way, it is inevitable that agriculture will be disfavored while industry and commerce are favored. As the saying goes, "Those with permanent property have constant virtue." To make farmers love the country and work hard to produce, they should not be deprived of their land. Zhu Ping said that there is no need to talk about private or public ownership; land must be controlled. Xiang Naiqi said that the tiller can only enjoy the right to use the land, and the use of cooperatives is the key to promoting this policy. Wang Xianqiang said that land price certificates should be issued according to the assessed land price, giving priority to purchasing land owned by non-self-cultivating farmers, and setting permanent cultivation rights to prohibit private buying and selling of land in order to realize "Land to the Tiller." Huang Tong said that ㊀ there is no need for national operation; ㊁ maintaining absolute ownership is not the trend of modern land policy; ㊂ small self-cultivating farmers have no future; ㊃ "Land to the Tiller" is not the land policy of our party; ㊄ to realize "Land to the Tiller" is to enable the tiller to enjoy the fruits of his cultivation. The methods are: 1. Rent reduction; 2. Progressive land tax; 3. Transfer of land by compensation. Zhang Pijie said that ㊀ tenant farmers should be transformed into self-cultivating farmers; ㊁ when reclaiming state-owned or public wasteland, the system of substitute reclamation should not be adopted; ㊂ land of landlords should be levied in areas with more tenant farmers to support self-cultivating farmers; ㊃ a land bank should be established to operate land finance business. Li Ruhan said that in countries where large-scale farming prevails, state-owned operation can be implemented, while in countries where small-scale farming prevails, a state-owned tenancy system should be implemented. In China, the tiller should have the right to own the land in the future. Zeng Jikuan said that ㊀ private individuals can only have the land price they reported, and the natural increase in value should be public; ㊁ the Premier's advocacy of "Land to the Tiller" is limited to the user. Finally, the chairman proposed that the presidium summarize everyone's opinions and draft a draft resolution to be submitted to the general assembly for discussion the next day.

▲List of Proposals First Proposal: Liu Xiuqing, Huang Tong, and others proposed that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be requested to quickly designate Qidong County as a land reform experimental zone to implement the "Land to the Tiller" plan. Second Proposal: Fang Xianting, Li Qinglin, and others proposed that the assessed land price be the only standard for taxation and that the method of estimating the land price be clearly stipulated. Third Proposal: Fang Xianting, Li Qinglin, and others proposed that the state issue public bonds to forcibly purchase land and distribute it to farmers. Fourth Proposal: The Pinghu County Government proposed that the land value tax should first be implemented in areas with higher land prices to increase tax revenue, or should it first be implemented in areas with lower land prices to reduce the burden on the people? Also, if the land value tax is implemented in areas with higher land prices, thereby increasing the burden on the people, or if the land value tax is implemented in areas with lower land prices, thereby reducing tax revenue, should the land tax be implemented? Please make a public decision. Fifth Proposal: The Pinghu County Government proposed that in areas with a developed tenancy system, what method is most appropriate to achieve the goal of creating self-cultivating farmers? Please make a public decision. Sixth Proposal: Dong Zhongsheng, Liu Xiuqing, and 16 others proposed that the association recommend that the central government abolish the deed tax. Seventh Proposal: The Jiangxi Provincial Land Administration Bureau proposed to formulate a method for determining land prices (to be continued).

### City Government Joint Memorial Week: Acting Mayor Yu Reports on Administrative Policies

Expressing Determination to Work Diligently Every Minute in Office; Balancing Labor-Management Relations, Protecting Investment, and Promoting Autonomy

Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the Shanghai Municipal Government held an enlarged memorial week meeting. Acting Mayor Yu delivered a report on administrative policies. The original text reads: "Colleagues, Comrades, Mayor Wu has been transferred to Guangdong to assume the position of Chairman of the Provincial Government. Upon Central Government orders, I, Hongjun, will temporarily act as Mayor. I would like to take this opportunity during the joint memorial week to share my thoughts and the administrative policies during my term with you all briefly. Mayor Wu has served in Shanghai for five to six years. During these years, Mayor Wu has truly managed the Shanghai municipality with great effort and dedication. Therefore, after the January 28th Incident, he was able to build a city center from the ashes. There has also been significant progress in other material and cultural constructions. Today, as we hold this joint memorial week, we cannot help but express our utmost respect when we think of Mayor Wu's past achievements in governing the city. At the same time, because Shanghai is a major trading port where Chinese and foreigners reside together, complex

diplomatic issues often arise. Over the past five to six years, Mayor Wu has been able to understand the central government's policies, understand the true intentions of the majority of the people, and respond to and resolve issues in a manner that is neither arrogant nor subservient. He has turned many tense situations in Shanghai in recent years from danger to safety. For this, Mayor Wu is especially worthy of our respect. This time, I, Hongjun, have been ordered to temporarily act as Mayor. I feel that my experience and knowledge are not sufficient to take on this important task. However, at the same time, I think that all colleagues in the Municipal Government are usually very responsible. If all colleagues can share this responsibility with Hongjun, that can slightly embolden Hongjun. I often say, "We don't want to be officials, we just want

to be people and do things." Hongjun feels that now is the time that heaven has given us this opportunity to test whether what I said before, "I don't want to be an official, I just want to be a person and do things," is sincere and can be put into practice. I think this is a good opportunity, not only to test whether I am a person who is dedicated to doing things, but also to test whether I am a person who can be a good person. What does this mean? If Hongjun thinks that he is only temporarily acting as Mayor and the time may be short, so he has the mentality of "a five-day magistrate of the capital" and procrastinates in everything, perfunctorily deals with matters, and waits and sees, then this proves that Hongjun can only be an official, not do things, and also

proves that I cannot be a good person. Comrades, you must know that Shanghai's social environment is very complex, and diplomatic affairs are intricate and cumbersome. In the world, all things either advance or retreat, especially when it comes to running a municipality. Although Hongjun has repeatedly expressed maintaining the status quo, we should clearly understand and give a definite definition to this sentence. What Hongjun means by maintaining the status quo is entirely in regards to people; we will never maintain the status quo in regards to things. The central government has entrusted us with the responsibility of Shanghai. If we sit still every day, how can we face the central government, and how can we face the citizens of the city? Without discussing other things, just take Shanghai's municipal finance as an example. In the past, due to various constructions, a considerable amount of money was needed, so public bonds were issued. Now, the

municipal government's debt totals more than ten million yuan. Now, the monthly income is not even enough for regular expenses. If the financial situation cannot be rectified immediately, and we continue to talk about maintaining the status quo and getting by until the new mayor comes, I am afraid that before the new mayor arrives, we will already be in dire straits. If the financial situation is like this, how can other businesses be any different? Therefore, what Hongjun said before about maintaining the status quo in everything only applies to people. Why should we maintain the status quo for people? Because many colleagues in the Municipal Government have served for ten or eight years, have a lot of experience, and have great enthusiasm for the Municipal Government. The reason why the situation of the Municipal Government has been relatively stable is also because there has not been much change

in personnel each time the mayor has been replaced in the past. This stability in personnel is a major reason why the Shanghai Municipal Government can continue to promote according to the original plan. Now that Mayor Wu has left the Municipal Government, Hongjun sincerely requests all colleagues, for the sake of the Municipal Government, please do not have the intention of leaving the Municipal Government. Hongjun's personal talent is limited, and the business of the Municipal Government is extremely heavy. There are too many places where Hongjun wants to rely on your colleagues to help. Therefore, it has been decided to maintain the status quo in terms of personnel. Maintaining the status quo in personnel is a policy established by previous mayors. Hongjun will, of course, follow this policy. As for the business, we must not procrastinate for a moment or be perfunctory for a moment. This time, Hongjun was ordered to temporarily act. I don't care whether the temporary term is long or short. I only know that while I am in office for one minute, I will do my job for one minute, and while I am acting as mayor for one day, I will

conscientiously perform the duties of the mayor for one day. This is what Hongjun wants to sincerely express to all colleagues today. Secondly, Hongjun wants to ask all colleagues to support the person who is performing the duties of the mayor. Hongjun is not asking all colleagues to support me, Yu, as an individual. What all colleagues should support is the person who is performing the duties of the mayor. This is for Shanghai's sake, for the country's sake, not for any individual's sake. Hongjun knows very well that all colleagues have high hopes for the future of the Shanghai Municipal Government and that the enthusiasm for the various constructions of the Municipal Government is probably ten or a hundred times greater than Hongjun's. But if all colleagues think that the old mayor has left, the new mayor has not yet arrived, and the person performing the duties of the mayor is only temporarily acting, and everyone procrastinates, then how can we face the country and Shanghai? Therefore, for the sake of the country and Shanghai, on the one hand, I ask to supervise myself strictly, and on the other hand, I ask all colleagues to not only support but also strictly supervise the person who is temporarily acting as mayor. Because if this temporary acting mayor procrastinates and makes mistakes, it will not only let down the country and Shanghai, but also subject himself to the blame of his conscience. Therefore, I personally want to supervise the person performing the duties of the acting mayor, that is, to constantly examine whether I have fulfilled

my responsibility. Colleagues, the relatively stable foundation and glorious situation that Shanghai has created now are entirely the result of the hard work of previous mayors. If in our hands, due to slightly careless measures, this foundation could easily be destroyed in our hands, not to mention that we will have nothing to say when the new mayor comes, even in the future when we ask ourselves, we will one day blame our own conscience. As for the future

administrative policies, I will briefly report a few points to you. First, regarding the various plans established by previous mayors, especially former Mayor Wu, all of us in the Municipal Government will definitely have great determination to complete them step by step, prioritizing them according to their importance and urgency. We must not let previous mayors, especially former Mayor Wu, have the slightest disappointment. This is the first point. Second, regarding the rectification of the internal affairs of the Municipal Government, the first priority is to quickly rectify the Municipal Government's finances. The method of rectification is, of course, none other than "increasing revenue and reducing expenditure." It is easy to talk about these four words, but it is difficult to do them. Fortunately, we have a very good Director of Finance who is very experienced. I hope that all colleagues will help him so that the city's finances can have a turnaround. In any case, we must strive for a balance between revenue and expenditure.

Second, the rectification of land administration. Land administration is related to finance. As the ancient saying goes, "With land, there is wealth." Therefore, if land administration can be properly rectified, the Municipal Government does not have to worry about being poor. Fortunately, Director Xu has made a great determination to rectify land administration. The method of rectification will definitely be to first formulate a detailed plan, but the implementation of the plan should not be rushed.

We should seek gradual improvement. If land administration can be done well, the financial problem can also be solved in conjunction. As for how to save expenses in various bureaus and agencies in the future, and how to reduce unnecessary expenses and consumption, this is a matter of urgency, and I hope that those in charge of each bureau and department will pay attention to it. Third, the National Economic Construction Movement must be promoted immediately. We have been organizing the National Economic Construction Movement according to the central government's orders for a considerable period of time. I, Hongjun, dare to believe that when we organize the National Economic Construction in Shanghai, we should not just "obey orders" and be done with it. We must study how to make the National Economic Construction plan suitable for Shanghai, how to make the National Economic Construction plan suitable for modern Shanghai. Regarding the National

Economic Construction, I would like to raise some points for discussion with all colleagues. First, in order to achieve the goal of National Economic Construction, we must immediately mediate labor-management disputes in Shanghai. We should not let labor strikes happen today and labor strikes happen again tomorrow. During this period, we should have an appropriate policy and steps. We should do our best to seek the harmony of labor and management interests, and further seek labor-management cooperation. Therefore, we must carefully study and proceed with what policies and steps to take for labor-management disputes. Second, regarding the prosperity of Shanghai, in recent years, few people have come to Shanghai to invest. The reason is that there is no guarantee for investment, and people are not at ease to invest. Therefore, it affects the development of Shanghai's industry and commerce, and the prosperity of Shanghai. Hongjun believes that we should pay attention to this immediately. We must implement the National Economic Construction plan promulgated by the central government, and we must pay attention to these two points: adapting to the times and adapting to local conditions. According to the actual situation in Shanghai, the Municipal Government should properly formulate an implementation plan to ensure that the people feel that their investment is fully guaranteed. In this way, the implementation of the National Economic Construction plan will be twice as effective with half the effort. Of course, we will fully cooperate

with local people in the future. This is not something that a few people in the Municipal Government can do alone. We must plan and implement it together with local leaders. We should try our best to consider what problems they have, and we should try our best to adopt their opinions. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of National Economic Construction. Fourth, I hope to select a suitable urban area to set up an autonomous experimental zone. The reasons why local autonomy was not organized in the past were: first, because of the existence of concessions, there were many obstacles; second, because of financial difficulties. But we cannot give up eating because of choking. Therefore, Hongjun wants to change the plan in the absence of a better solution, and first select a suitable area

as an experimental zone so that the people have considerable knowledge and ability of autonomy to lay the foundation for constitutional government. If this experimental zone is run well, it can be a model for other districts. If it is not run well, it can also be a reference for our improvement. The above two points may take a lot of time, but Hongjun just said that while I am in office for one minute, I will definitely be responsible for one minute. Perhaps the term of acting is very short, but I cannot ignore the century-old plan of the Shanghai Municipal Government because the term of acting is not long, especially for all the plans set by former Mayor Wu. We must prioritize and implement them according to their importance and urgency. What I just talked about, the two things about the National Economic Construction and the preparation for the autonomous experimental zone, are also the aspirations of Mayor Wu. Since the colleagues of the Municipal Government cannot immediately realize all of Mayor Wu's aspirations, they cannot but choose two relatively important things to do first. Hongjun has never been pessimistic. No matter how difficult it is, as long as we

grit our teeth and go, regardless of success or failure, as long as we ask ourselves whether we have done our best, whether we are worthy of our own conscience, there is no difficult task in the world. Our cause may take a considerable amount of time to succeed, but if we recognize our responsibilities and do it with our own conscience, one day we will be able to solve it easily. The above words are not only to encourage all colleagues, but also to encourage myself. Today, I took advantage of the opportunity of the joint memorial week to report the administrative policies to all colleagues, and I ask all colleagues to give me more advice.

### Xu Shiying Withdraws Resignation Intention, Decides to Return to Post

To Visit Foreign Minister Wang Tonight in Beijing

Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying met with reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency at his private residence yesterday afternoon. According to the discussion, his intention to resign was discussed with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai. Chiang firmly refused and encouraged him. Because he could not refuse out of courtesy, he has decided to withdraw his resignation. He is scheduled to go to Japan in late next month to return to his post. He plans to go to Beijing tonight (tonight) to meet with Foreign Minister Wang to discuss everything, and then return to Shanghai to inspect Mount Huangshan before returning to Shanghai to wait for the ship. He will go to Beijing again before leaving.

### Soviet Ambassador to Visit Beijing Tomorrow

To Visit Foreign Minister Wang

According to the Central News Agency, Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov arrived in Shanghai on the first of this month to return to his post. Ambassador Bao has been away from Shanghai for a long time, and he is very busy entertaining various circles in Shanghai. It is now scheduled to take a train to Beijing on the 7th to visit our Foreign Minister Wang to congratulate him. He is scheduled to stay in Beijing for August, and then go to Tianjin and Beijing.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Income Tax Calculation Method

The Ministry of Finance yesterday approved the method of calculating income tax, replying to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Received. The provision of Article 11 of the Implementing Rules, 'For the second category of income, if the period is less than one month, the tax shall be calculated based on the actual amount of income,' refers to the standard for calculating the tax. As for how to calculate the method, it is not clearly stipulated. Therefore, the supplementary provisions of Item 12 of the draft Collection Instructions for the Second Category do not conflict. The salaries and wages of the employees of various factories mentioned in the presentation, which change monthly, are different from the situation stipulated in Article 11 of the Implementing Rules. Although there is a fixed monthly amount for this salary and wage, those who ask for leave will have their salary deducted on a daily basis, those who work overtime will have their salary increased on a daily basis, those who are late will have their salary deducted on an hourly basis, and those who extend their working hours will have their salary increased on an hourly basis. The income is calculated on a daily basis, and the income for each day is calculated on an hourly basis. Although the salary and wage have a fixed monthly amount, they are actually calculated on a daily and hourly basis. Therefore, the tax for this income should be calculated based on the actual amount obtained in each month. It is not difficult in calculation. Also, the request to amend Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations concerns legal provisions and has been submitted to the competent department for reference. The foregoing situation is hereby approved for the Association's information. This approval.

### General Labor Union Requests Implementation of Mandatory Arbitration

Party and Government Express Acceptance; Implementation Pending Consultation

The Shanghai General Labor Union believes that the recent labor strikes in Shanghai have affected the livelihoods of workers and the future of industry, which is deeply and greatly concerning. Therefore, an emergency executive committee meeting was convened to resolve the issue. In addition to publishing a letter to all industry workers in the city, urging the implementation of labor-management coordination and avoiding unnecessary disputes, it also requested the Party and Government to implement mandatory arbitration to seek solutions. Yesterday morning, Standing Committee members Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kechang, etc., went to the Municipal Government to visit Acting Mayor Yu to present everything in person. Mr. Yu personally received them. The representatives reported on the recent labor strikes in Shanghai, hoping that the Municipal Government would implement arbitration as soon as possible. Mr. Yu expressed his appreciation for the Association's concern for social security and assistance to the government in resolving labor strikes. They then went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to visit Director Pan. Because Mr. Pan was not in the bureau, Section Chief Xu Yefu received them on his behalf and replied that regarding the arbitration of labor-management disputes, the Municipal Government originally had an arbitration committee, but because there have been few and unimportant labor strikes in the past two years, the Social Affairs Bureau has handled them directly. Now, due to social changes, workers in various industries are demanding improvements in their treatment, which is normal. However, it has resulted in serious labor strikes. If we do not find a way to resolve them, it will undoubtedly have a significant impact. Therefore, there is a need to submit them to arbitration to seek a quick solution. He expressed extreme agreement with the Association's suggestion and promised to report it to the director for approval and implementation. Then, the representatives went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where Committee Member Lu Jingshi received them. He also believed that the implementation of mandatory arbitration was necessary and promised to consult with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and other departments before implementing it immediately.

### Real Estate Association Petitions the Municipal Government to Reduce Land Price Tax Rate

Real Estate is Increasingly Sluggish, Land Tax is Increasing Instead; Unable to Bear the Heavy Burden, Should Request to Continue Taxing at the Original Rate

The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association again submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting to maintain the original land price tax rate, stating, "The real estate is increasingly sluggish, the land tax is increasing instead, the people's strength is exhausted, and they are unable to bear the heavy burden. It is requested to continue taxing at the original rate to cultivate vitality and care for the people's livelihood." Respectfully received Your Government's No. 4377 approval for an application submitted by the Association to request

revaluation of land prices and reduction of tax rates. The approval stated, "Received. The valuation of land within the scope of the provisional land price tax collection in this city began in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]. At that time, the commercial situation was depressed after the January 28th Incident, which was worse than today. The land price for tax collection at that time was already lower than the market value. It has been reviewed and approved by the valuation committee, and in response to the citizens' request, the price of the taxable land was reduced to 40-50% of the original estimated value. Regardless of how the real estate has declined in recent years, it is still lower than the market price at the time of sale. As for the land price tax rate in this city, the original rate was 6 per mille, which has recently been changed to 7 per mille. It has been reviewed and approved by the Municipal Council and approved by the Central Government, and it has been implemented this year. The request should not be discussed. Acknowledge accordingly." In response, the Association's previous request was originally because the land price was low,

the tax rate was too high, and the people's strength was insufficient to bear the burden. Now, the approval shows that the original tax rate has been increased by one-sixth, which is unexpected. The reasons why the tax cannot be increased are hereby presented to My Governor. The land tax in this city, after changing the labor corvee to the land price tax, has increased several times or even hundreds of times. The people have tried their best to pay it, and they already feel unable to bear it. At this time of economic depression and great difficulties in the future, comforting them is still a concern, how can we bear to exploit them again? This is the first reason why the tax should not be increased. Land tax is a major national law. Once it is stipulated, it cannot be easily changed. Therefore, it has been passed down through the ages, and no one dares to easily talk about increasing the tax. The land price tax in this city has only been implemented for three years, and it has already increased significantly compared to the original land tax. The public system has just been established, and the people have not yet had a chance to breathe. Now, after changing course, without giving the people a chance to recuperate, we are changing things for the worse and hastily proposing changes. If we increase it every few years like this, where will it end?

The people's livelihood is haggard, how can they bear it? This is the second reason why the tax should not be increased. Since the January 28th Incident, the market in this city has plummeted, and real estate in particular has no one to care about. In addition to lowering prices and rents, empty closures are still everywhere. As a result, the interest income of real estate has decreased compared to the tax reduction, and it is almost impossible to maintain. The tax comes from rent. Under this kind of situation, is there a possibility of increasing the tax? This is the third reason why the tax should not be increased. The approval stated that in response to the citizens' request at that time, the taxable land was reduced to 40-50% of the estimated value. Therefore, regardless of how it is, it should be lower than the market price. After a thorough investigation, the citizens did not make this request at that time, and the government did not make this expression. The statement of 40-50% has not been announced to the people, so it is difficult to use it as a basis. Looking at the land price tax receipt, the estimated land price column does not have any discount marks, which can serve as clear evidence. This cannot be used to justify the tax increase. This is the fourth reason why the tax should not be increased. The valuation of the land price tax should be estimated to what extent. At that time, it must have been based on the supply and demand standards.

verify and estimate. It was not possible to lower or raise it. Since it has been estimated in the past, it should be followed in the future. If it is said that the real estate market is better now, the rent reduction is still the same, and the empty space is still the same. Even if the valuation was lowered at that time, and the current situation has not improved, it can only maintain the original tax rate. There is no way to increase the tax based on this. This is the fifth reason why the tax should not be increased. The wise men of the past said that if the people are sufficient, with whom will the ruler be insufficient? If the people are insufficient, with whom will the ruler be sufficient? The wind of recession is sweeping the country, and the people are extremely distressed. We still ask you to consider the people's livelihood, give a little care, and allow the land price tax in this city to continue to be collected at the original rate, and not increase it again, so as to support the vitality. The country and the people will truly benefit from it. Therefore, we specially submit this petition, and we humbly ask for your approval. This is a great convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.

### Striving to Recover Jurisdiction Through Unified Effort

Shanghai Lawyers' Association - Circular to Provincial Associations

Regarding the Shanghai Lawyers' Association's efforts to reclaim consular jurisdiction, it has already petitioned the Executive Yuan of the National Government requesting a formal diplomatic note to all countries currently exercising consular jurisdiction. The association yesterday also sent a circular to lawyers' associations in various provinces and legal organizations, urging them to unite in this endeavor. The original circular is transcribed below: We respectfully inform you that the consular jurisdiction exercised by various countries in China not only destroys our national legal structure but also daily infringes upon the lives, property, and rights of our people. The severity of its harm is unparalleled. Over the years, our countrymen have repeatedly cried out and advocated for its abolition, yet these efforts have amounted to nothing, and the situation remains unchanged. Now that our nation is unified and progressing towards national rejuvenation, the continued existence of consular jurisdiction poses a significant obstacle to this revival. Following a proposal by member Lu Dingkui and others, this association has formally petitioned the Executive Yuan of the National Government to send formal notes to all countries with consular jurisdiction, requesting a deadline for its abolition. Should this request not be granted by the deadline, we will declare its unilateral revocation. As this matter concerns the struggle for the liberation of the entire nation, we are sending you a copy of the petition for your consideration. If you support this cause, we earnestly hope that your association will join us in advocating for it.

### French Concession Employment Agency Fee Increase - Municipal Council Agrees to Reduce

Spring Fee Must Be Paid in Full - Agencies May Pay Remaining Fees in Installments

The French Concession Municipal Council decided to increase the monthly fee for employment agencies by six yuan per quarter starting this year. As the industry was unable to bear this burden, it requested the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to repeatedly petition the Municipal Council for a reduction. After repeated negotiations by the Ratepayers Association with the Municipal Council, it was reported that in light of the financial difficulties faced by employment agencies, the Council would reconsider the matter at a board meeting and grant a reduction. However, the quarterly fee of six yuan could not be reduced and should be paid promptly. The Ratepayers Association immediately notified the employment agencies, who expressed their willingness to reluctantly accept the terms yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, but requested that the Municipal Council allow them to pay the spring fee in two installments of three yuan each due to the genuine financial difficulties of the industry. The Ratepayers Association agreed to relay this request to the Municipal Council.

### Grand Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of the April 12th Incident in the City

Meetings, Pagoda Construction, and Commemorative Banquets

This month's 12th marks the tenth anniversary of the April 12th Incident (purge of the Communists). The city's Party headquarters has decided to hold a commemorative meeting on that day, as detailed in this newspaper. It is now heard that various groups in the city will hold a large-scale celebration. The following is a report from a National News Agency reporter on the various events:

Commemorative Meeting

The city's Party Committee has decided to hold a commemorative meeting on the morning of the 12th, the tenth anniversary of the April 12th Incident, in accordance with central government regulations. The meeting will be held at 10:00 AM in the grand auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge. The presidium has been decided as follows: Lu Jingshi of the city Party headquarters, Acting Mayor Yu of the city government, Commander Yang of the headquarters, Yu Zhenhui of the city Farmers' Association, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Wang Xiaolai of the city Chamber of Commerce, Huang Zaoqiang of the city Education Association, Du Yuesheng of the local association, and Lin Keting of the city Women's Association. The publicity department will be responsible for the emcee, recording, and reception, while the investigation department will be responsible for security. All are to be notified to fly flags for one day in celebration.

Construction of a Memorial Pagoda

Various public groups in the city, including farmers, industrialists, merchants, and students, believe that on this tenth anniversary of the April 12th Incident, it is important to recall the sacrifices made by these groups ten years ago in assisting the government's purge of the Communists. Their contributions were significant. Now that the tenth anniversary is here, the communists have been completely eliminated, and the purge has achieved its full success. A permanent memorial should be established as recognition, and thus it is proposed to build a memorial pagoda to the April 12th Incident. The location will be in the city center or at Longhua and will be decided later.

Commemorative Banquet

In addition to the tangible memorial of constructing a pagoda, various public groups believe that a commemorative banquet should be held to celebrate the tenth anniversary and to honor those who contributed to the purge in the city. Therefore, the various groups have decided to hold a commemorative banquet at noon on the 12th at the Huangjia Garden in Caohejing, honoring those who contributed to the purge in the city to show their enthusiasm.

Commemorative Badges

In addition to the construction of a memorial pagoda and the commemorative banquet, the various public groups believe that commemorative items should be given to those attending the banquet and to those who contributed to the purge to show their appreciation and to ensure they are not forgotten. Therefore, it was decided that the city's public groups would create commemorative badges to be distributed to attendees, as well as gold commemorative badges to be given to those who contributed to the purge for permanent remembrance. The design of these two commemorative items is solemn, with fine and delicate carvings, and is expected to be very unique.

### Liu Hangchen Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Bank Matters

Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, and Guan Jiyu, special envoy of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, traveled east together from Sichuan via Beijing to Shanghai last week. They have been visiting Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance, and leaders of the Shanghai banking community to discuss investment matters, with satisfactory results. According to a reporter, the organization of the Sichuan Bank, proposed by Director Liu and others to promote the construction of Sichuan Province, is progressing smoothly. The bank's capital is tentatively set at five million yuan, and it is planned to start operations after half of the capital is collected.

### National Goods Production and Sales Association Requests Cessation of Silk Weaving Labor Strike

The strike wave in the silk weaving factories of this city has occurred repeatedly. Although the Party and government authorities have strictly ordered the resumption of work, the strike has not yet subsided and there are recent indications of it spreading. The China National Goods Production and Sales Association, considering the repeated strikes will greatly impact the gradually improving national industry, has separately submitted reports to the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that they be quickly stopped.

### Silk Association Promotes Seed Production

Expanding Seed Planting Fields in Various Places

Over the years, thanks to the efforts of the Silk Improvement Association and the silk organizations in various provinces, our nation's silk industry has made gradual progress in improving breeds. It is now learned that the Silk Association believes that the promotion of improved silkworm varieties still needs to continue to achieve full success. However, there is a severe shortage of improved silkworm varieties in our country. In the past, we had to rely on Italy and Japan for these silkworm varieties, and if there was a shortage, it was difficult to purchase replacements. The association believes that it is essential to find ways to become self-sufficient. Starting this year, it is determined to expand seed production and has begun to expand the silkworm breeding fields in various places.

### Fisheries Syndicate Promotes Fisheries Loans

Since the official establishment of the Fisheries Syndicate of the Ministry of Industry, with the appointment of Wang Zhixin as general manager and the active establishment of an economics department to begin lending, there have been continuous applications for loans as the spring fishing season has arrived. However, most of them do not meet the loan regulations and have not been approved. Currently, the approved loans amount to only over 10,000 yuan for a certain fishing vessel. According to a New News Agency reporter's inquiries with fish merchants, most fishermen and fish merchants are not clear about the establishment of the Fisheries Syndicate and do not know the content and procedures of the loans. Moreover, some fishermen are completely unaware of the establishment of the syndicate. Therefore, although the spring fishing season has arrived, there is no enthusiastic application for loans, which is a natural trend. It is hoped that the syndicate will pay attention to the promotion of loans so that fishermen, fish merchants, and related fisheries agencies can understand the loan procedures and apply for loans in accordance with the law, so as to fulfill the Ministry's original intention of supporting the fisheries industry. It is understood that the syndicate has only recently been established, and personnel and various matters are urgently awaiting deployment. Therefore, various external tasks have not yet been completed at once. Currently, while paying attention to the promotion of loans, it is also engaged in conducting investigations. The investigation of the fishing area around Jinshanwei has been completed and a draft report is being prepared to be submitted to the board of directors. At the same time, investigators have been sent to Wenzhou to continue the investigation and promote the syndicate's loan methods in order to have an in-depth effect on the fishing villages.

### South China Rice Company Scheduled to Hold Inaugural Meeting

The South China Rice Company, initiated and organized by financial figures from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, and sponsored by leading Party and government figures such as Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and Song Ziwen, aims to transport Anhui rice and regulate the food supply in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The company has a capital of ten million yuan, with half of it subscribed by the founders and the remainder publicly solicited. The subscription period is scheduled to end today. The Guangdong Bank in this city is acting as the receiving agent for the share subscriptions, which will close on the 15th of this month. It is reported that subscriptions have been very enthusiastic and the amount has already been met. Shanghai subscriptions account for the largest share, accounting for 80%. The company's inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road on the afternoon of the 17th. The company plans to establish rice mills and warehouses in Guangzhou and Wuhu, and has sent personnel to survey the sites separately. Construction will begin after the company is established.

### New Board of Directors Established for Bank of China

Elect Kong Xiangxi and Others as Standing Directors - Song Ziwen Remains Chairman

The Ministry of Finance appointed Song Ziwen as chairman, and Chairman Song appointed Song Hanzhang as the bank's general manager. A formal document has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for filing.

### Laid-Off Employees of Fish Market Petition

The Shanghai Fish Market recently laid off 69 employees in order to cut expenses. The laid-off employees petitioned the fish market authorities yesterday. The market's deputy managers, Zhu Kaiguan and Sun Juechen, received them. The laid-off employees stated that their dismissals were not due to ordinary misconduct and requested a severance payment equivalent to one year's salary to maintain their livelihoods. Zhu and Sun promised to relay the request. It is now learned that Chairman Du Yuesheng has agreed to allocate a severance payment equivalent to six months' salary, but it is subject to consultation and decision by Chairman Du and the standing directors before it can be disbursed.

### Silk Brocade Guild and Others Telegraph Request for Balancing of Artificial Silk Textile Tax Rates

The import tariff rate on artificial silk in our country is lower than that on woven finished products. This was originally intended to prevent the domestic sale of foreign goods. However, artificial silk is taxed based on quantity. In the past, each case was worth 500 yuan, but now it is only 150 yuan, while the tariff is still 290 yuan per case. If a case of artificial silk is used to weave items, the value is taxed at 80 per cent, which amounts to 120 yuan. This is a difference of more than two times. The tariff barrier has lost its balance. Therefore, neighboring countries' silk spinning and weaving products have been imported in large quantities in recent years. Domestic products have increased in cost due to the heavy raw material tax and cannot compete. The chairman of the Shanghai Silk Brocade Guild, Luo Qinghua, and others believe that without improving the tax system, the future of domestic silk is unimaginable. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance with Cai Shengbai, chairman of the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association, requesting modifications. The telegram read: "Minister Kong of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, we respectfully note that when our country initially set the import tariff on artificial silk at 60 per cent of the value and the import tariff on woven finished products at 80 per cent of the value, the intention was for the tariff rate on finished woven products to be higher than the tariff rate on artificial silk raw materials, in order to prevent the domestic sale of foreign silk. This was a well-intentioned law. In recent years, due to the excellent quality and sharp drop in the price of artificial silk, coupled with exchange rate factors, the bill of lading for each case of artificial silk is 150 yuan, while the tariff is 290 yuan due to the ad valorem tax. The tariff rate is almost three times higher than that of woven finished products. The tariff barrier is counterproductive. Our country's silk industry weaves items with raw materials taxed at three times the rate compared to silk brocades taxed at 80 percent of the value, resulting in a large price difference. The defense will fail, please decide to immediately make changes. Last year, silk spinning and weaving from neighboring countries was all over the market. In the past two or three months, like bamboo shoots after the rain, all the markets have been filled, and the goods have been sold at reduced prices. If measures are not taken urgently and the tariffs are not balanced, then domestic silk sales will be bankrupt, and millions of weavers will lose their jobs. The future is dangerous, and it is impossible to imagine. We specifically telegraph your ministry to re-levy the import tax on woven finished products and collect the import tax on artificial silk ad valorem, so that the balance can be restored, and domestic silk can gain a foothold. This concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood. We beg you to allow us to handle this matter, and we are anxiously awaiting orders." Chairman Luo Qinghua of the Shanghai Silk Brocade Industry Association and Chairman Cai Shubi of the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association.

### Yesterday, Visitors Swarmed the Suburbs for the Qingming Festival

Mourners Formed an Endless Stream Along the Roads

Yesterday was the Shangyuan Festival (i.e., Qingming Festival), and the weather was bright and sunny, with a gentle breeze and warm sun. Therefore, people generally wanted to go on excursions in the suburbs. At the same time, in the suburbs of this city, such as Zhabei, West Shanghai, Pudong, Longhua, Xujiahui, and other public cemeteries and funeral homes, there were also crowds of people going to pay respects due to the Qingming Festival. The roads were crowded with vehicles, forming an endless stream. Some people even hired cars to go to Luhuajing, Dingqiao, and Fahua to sweep tombs, making taxis even busier. Various cemeteries and funeral homes also opened their gates yesterday, allowing family members of those buried there to enter and exit to pay their respects. However, in some places, due to the religious affiliations of the founders, the burning of paper money was not allowed. The Municipal Police Bureau, recognizing the large number of vehicles and people, specially ordered the various branch bureaus to pay attention to maintaining order. At the same time, the Yimiao temple held its annual City God Temple festival. A large number of people also went to watch the festival. Longhua was the most popular destination for general outings. Along the way, there were vendors selling green willow branches and peach blossoms, making a decent living.

City God Procession: Yesterday was the date for the annual Qingming Festival procession of the City God of Yimiao and the five deity statues of the God of Wealth, etc. The ceremonial guard was grand, with more than a hundred groups participating in the festival. Hundreds of people, including prisoners in red with shackles and the incense-carrying horse team, gathered inside and outside the City God Temple. The crowd standing and watching the festival numbered no less than ten thousand, showing the grand scale of the event. The festival procession departed from the Yimiao at noon and arrived at the Nanzhan Baoan Road altar in the evening. At 7 PM, the procession began to return from the altar, with the lamps and candles shining brightly, making it even more lively. The procession returned to the Fangbang Road temple for incense offering around 10 PM. The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the martial arts incident that occurred during the Pudong festival the day before, added more police officers to maintain order yesterday. Everything went smoothly along the way without any incident. At the same time, the city trams and buses were extremely crowded with passengers, and the rickshaws also made twice as much money. The bicycle rental shops were completely rented out.

Suburban Excursions: The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities buses, during the Qingming Festival each year, if the weather is fine, see many men and women going on excursions. Therefore, it is customary to add nine buses to the route from Ximen to Longhua to accommodate the passengers. Yesterday, nine buses were still added to the Longhua route, and they were very crowded. There were even more people driving their own cars to Longhua Road for excursions, with a mixture of footwear and fluttering sleeves, creating a very charming scene. The Zhabei section of the public buses also added more trips at the same time, but most of the passengers were going to Jiangwan, Tiantong'an, Yanxu Villa, Yangzhou Guild Hall, Guangzhao Villa, and other funeral homes to pay respects, carrying ingots, paper money, and grass baskets, making them extremely crowded. The crowds only gradually thinned out until around 10 PM. At the same time, the roadside fruit vendors and rickshaw pullers also made three times as much money. The city trams were still crowded with people late into the night, and the sound of people looking for shoes and handkerchiefs could be heard everywhere. Fortunately, the police maintained order carefully, and there were no incidents.

### Old Woman Chen Suzhen Claims to Be Li Bohang's Concubine, Sues for Division of Inheritance

She Bowed Repeatedly to the Court, Seeking a Good Deed - Judge Advises Parties to Attempt Reconciliation

Li Duanfu, also known as Bohang, the eldest son of the late Qing dynasty Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang, served as the Imperial Envoy to England for three years. After his death in Ningbo some time ago, he left behind a considerable amount of inheritance, which has already been divided by his children in accordance with his will. Recently, a 52-year-old local woman, Li Chen Suzhen, claiming to be Duanfu's concubine, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court against Duanfu's son, Li Guotao, Guoxiao, daughters Guohua, Guoyun, grandson Jiaji, etc.,

Seeking Division of Inheritance

Requesting payment of 54,000 yuan and requesting permission for legal aid. Yesterday at 2:30 PM, this case was heard by Judge Gui Yu in Civil Division 7. The summons for the defendant Li Guoxiao could not be delivered and therefore he did not appear in court. The other defendants, Guotao, etc., hired lawyers to appear on their behalf. The plaintiff, Li Chen Suzhen, did not hire a lawyer. She stated that she was 52 years old, from Shanghai, residing at 997 Hartung Road, and had been Li Duanfu's concubine for

More Than Thirty Years.

Although she had some savings, they were all destroyed by the bombardment when she lived in Zhabei during the January 28th Incident. All her private savings were exhausted. When Duanfu passed away three years ago, she was in Shanghai, so she did not receive a single penny of the inheritance. Duanfu left behind a considerable amount of property after his death. Now, she is in dire need of funds, so she is requesting that the defendants be ordered to pay her living expenses of 54,000 yuan and requesting permission to be exempted from paying

Legal Fees.

Having said that, she presented several handwritten letters from Duanfu to her as evidence and bowed repeatedly, asking the court to help her, considering that she was over half a century old, unable to find food, and to do a good deed. The defendants' lawyer stated that the matter was completely unfounded and that they did not know the plaintiff at all. After Duanfu's death, all his inheritance had been distributed in accordance with his will, and the plaintiff was not included. He requested that the lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Gui instructed that the case be rescheduled for further hearing at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month and instructed both parties to try to reconcile out of court.

### Sihuimen Headman Ling Mingshan Chains Wife with Iron Chain

Out of Resentment for Wife's Interference with Gambling, He Resorts to This Cruel Act - Fortunately, Wife Has Bound Feet and Escapes from Iron Chain

Ling Mingshan, a 32-year-old native of Anhui, lives at No. 42, Lane 503, East Youheng Road. He is a sihuimen headman at the French Company's steamship wharf. He is addicted to gambling and often quarrels and fights with his wife, Fan. Around 9:00 AM the other morning, the two sides had another disagreement. Ling was extremely angry and resentful. He secretly went out and bought an iron chain and two locks from a nearby second-hand shop. He returned home at 2:15 PM, pretending to be unwell and went to bed. She did not know his intentions and told him to

Rest Comfortably. Unexpectedly, Ling gave a secret signal, and his father, Yunqing, and younger brother, Mingshi, suddenly entered the room, helping him to tie Fan's hands with lead wire and lock her feet with an iron chain, accusing her of being unruly, often quarreling with her husband for no reason, and destroying objects. She was locked in the room and not allowed to take a step outside. She called for help and cried, but they ignored her. After about an hour, she tried her best to move her feet. Fortunately, she had

Bound Feet Since the Late Qing Dynasty. Her bones were thin, and she slipped one foot out of the chain, and climbed out of the window, went to the drying platform, escaped to the neighbor's house, untied the lead wire, and went straight to the Jiayu Road police station to report the incident, crying out the details. After a while, Ling Mingshan also went to the police station to defend his reasons for tying up Fan. He immediately brought the key to unlock the iron chain on Fan's feet. The police chief, on the grounds that Ling should not have privately detained his wife, violated criminal law, arrested him, and dispatched Chinese detective Yang Xinzheng and detective Liu Longchao to

Rush to her house. After investigation, the father, Ling Yunqing, and son, Ling Mingshi, had already fled. Yesterday morning, Ling Mingshan was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and filed a public prosecution based on Article 302 of the Criminal Law, obstructing freedom and private detention. He stated that the defendant admitted to the police that he had tied up his wife himself, and his father and brother did not actually help, his words were false. Because his wife's

Body is Strong. The marks on her hands where the lead wire was tied were quite severe and have not yet disappeared. Her advice to her husband not to gamble was legitimate and not an irregular behavior. Therefore, he asked to be dealt with according to the law. Subsequently, Fan claimed that she had been married to the defendant for more than ten years and had two children. Recently, because her husband often went to a certain hotel to gamble on Pai Gow, she quarreled with him and did not

Destroy objects. According to the Chinese and Western detectives' report on the investigation, the iron chain and two locks were presented for inspection. The defendant was questioned, and he denied being addicted to gambling, saying that his wife often quarreled with him and destroyed utensils. She was several months pregnant, and he could not hit her, so he resorted to this trick, asking for leniency. The lawyer defending him, Subei Fentui, sentenced Ling Mingshan to one year of imprisonment, suspended for four years, for private detention. The iron chain and lock were confiscated.

### Naked Corpse Discovered in Empty House on Xieqiao

Corpse Already Decayed - Strict Investigation of the Cause

Inside the empty house of the Municipal Health Bureau's dung cart storage site at the western end of Xieqiao in Nanshi, at 9:00 AM yesterday, a dung cart driver smelled a peculiar odor that was offensive, arousing suspicion. He immediately inspected and found a naked male corpse, about thirty years old, lying on top of a pile of straw in the corner. The body was already rotten, and the stench was overwhelming, causing people to cover their noses. It was thought that the corpse had been there for many days, but mixed with the smell of dung, no one noticed it for a while. After the police on duty heard about it, they reported it to the police station, which informed the local ward head and requested an autopsy by the court. The police were also dispatched to strictly investigate the origins of the corpse and the cause of death in order to handle the case.

### Silk Weaving Union Official Arrested for Allegedly Forcing Workers to Strike

Zou Bozong and Wang Jinsheng Deny Inciting - Case Concluded After Hearing, Sentence Scheduled for Friday

The silk industry workers in this city, due to demands for increased wages and improved treatment from the factory, incited a strike, which has been mediated by various party and government agencies calling labor and capital to work hard and ordering the labor side to resume work first. The workers of the Meifeng Silk Weaving Factory at No. 83 Haizhou Road resumed work uniformly the morning before last. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 PM, the Yangshupu police station received a phone report from the Yulin Road police station stating that a large number of workers were carrying banners and

Distributing leaflets, gathered on Huade Road, requesting the dispatch of detectives to maintain order. The police station ordered the dispatch of Chinese and Western detectives, along with more than a hundred Chinese constables, to rush to suppress the situation in police vehicles. They saw about five or six hundred people gathered, entering Pingliang Road from Huade Road to the vicinity of the Meifeng Silk Factory on Haizhou Road, and several people at the head rushed into the factory, forcing the workers to strike. The detectives stepped forward to arrest Zou Bozong, director of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Union, and Wang Jinsheng, supervisor, two people, and the rest

Then Dispersed. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted according to Article 151 of the Criminal Law, obstructing public order, and stated the above situation. Subsequently, Gao Hou and Xing Zhuangqing, employees of the Meifeng Silk Factory, claimed that our factory had followed the Hengfeng factory and went on strike from January 27th of this year to February 10th, and resumed work. This was the

Second Strike. Because we obeyed the orders of the party and government agencies, we started to resume work uniformly the morning before last. Unexpectedly, at more than 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the defendants and others came and claimed that the conditions have not yet been fully resolved, how can we resume work first? While we were talking, the detectives had already arrived and arrested us, etc. Questioned, Zou Yizong and Wang Jinsheng confessed that we are all supervisors and directors of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Union.

We had previously inquired with the Social Affairs Bureau, and were instructed to resume work first, so we led the workers to the factory to resume work. We first went to the Hengfeng Silk Factory next to Meifeng, then to Meifeng. Because Meifeng had already resumed work, we simply went to collect membership fees from the factory, unexpectedly we were arrested, and there was no coercion to strike. They hired lawyers to defend them. Judge Zhan Liangce instructed that the debate be concluded, and the sentence was scheduled to be pronounced on Friday. The two defendants were remanded in custody.

### Sun Shaoqing Sentenced for Continuous Extortion

Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment and a Fine of One Thousand Yuan, Sun Zhu's Perjury Sentenced to One Year

Sun Shaoqing, a native of Tongzhou, and his wife, Sun Zhu, were arrested by Public Concession Police Chief Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui for colluding in lawsuits and extorting money. A public prosecution was filed with the First Special District Court. Qian Hongye, Chief Criminal Judge of the Special Court, opened court for questioning several times, and the debate had already begun. Later, the debate was suspended because further evidence needed to be investigated. These details have been reported in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian, accompanied by Prosecutor Tang, took the bench in the First Criminal Division to continue hearing the case. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang said that since the last postponement, the police had found the witness Fang Nianlu, who had arrived in court today and should be questioned. Fang then testified that the defendant Sun Shaoqing's mother-in-law, Chen Fang (i.e., Zhu Fang), was my aunt. After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, I lost my job and relied on Sun for a living. I joined the Dawn Law Firm jointly established by Sun and Jiang Zhaozhou to handle affairs. The firm was initially located at No. 15, Ji Wu Fang, Ximen Road, and later moved to No. 424 Pope Road. The cases prosecuted by the police station were all presided over by Jiang Zhaozhou and Sun Shaoqing. Their method of fraud was to file lawsuits, write threatening letters, throw excrement, make threatening phone calls, etc. Later, my neighbor, a woman named Lin Yayue, after being raped and abandoned by Guo Weiyi, the manager of the Watson Soda Water Factory, was introduced by me to Sun and Jiang for handling. A lawsuit was filed against Guo in the Second Special District Court. At that time, Sun and others guaranteed that there would be no problem. Unexpectedly, the lawsuit was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired, and Guo filed a countersuit for false accusation. Lin's husband, Du Guang, contacted me. I deeply felt that Sun's actions would definitely fail one day. If something happened, I was afraid of being implicated, so I surrendered to the police station. During the court hearing, after verifying the confession, Sun Shaoqing and his wife were questioned, but both denied it and shirked responsibility. Judge Qian then ordered the debate to continue. After the lawyers for the police station, Wang Yaotang, and the defendant, Chen Ying, Yang Linzhi, and Lu Qi, debated each other, Judge Qian then announced the verdict in court. Sun Shaoqing was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for continuous extortion and fined 1,000 yuan. If the fine is converted to labor, the amount of conversion per day is determined in proportion to two yuan and six months. Deprivation of civil rights for ten years. Sun Zhu was sentenced to one year imprisonment for perjury. The parts of the charges against Sun Shaoqing and Sun Zhu for colluding in lawsuits for profit and extortion were acquitted. Sun Shaoqing and Sun Zhu were then escorted to prison by police and legal police for detention.

### The Conclusion of Ye Fukan's Case Debate

Sentencing Set for the Tenth

The case of lawyer Ye Fukan, accused by Hebei resident Wang Hanqing to the Ministry of Justice of embezzlement, was assigned to the Shanghai Local Court. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu conducted a clear investigation and ordered Ye to deposit a cash guarantee of 20,000 yuan and filed a public prosecution. Judge Lu Hongyi conducted repeated trials, but because the plaintiff Wang Hanqing consistently failed to appear, the case remained unresolved. Details were reported in previous issues. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Lu continued the trial. The plaintiff Wang Hanqing still did not appear, only the defendant Ye Fukan was questioned in court. He firmly claimed that there was no embezzlement. At this point, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu was invited to the court to present the prosecution's arguments, stating, "In this case, the defendant Ye Fukan embezzled more than ten pieces of gold jewelry and over 12,000 yuan in bank deposits from Wang Hanqing. This fact is very clear in the file of Wang's private prosecution against Ye in the First Special District Court. Furthermore, lawyer Cai Ding testified in court, and the defendant also admitted to returning 1,000 yuan in public funds and compensating 1,000 yuan in losses. It seems unreasonable for a lawyer to compensate losses and return public funds to the client. There is obvious dishonesty and embezzlement. A lawyer should be upright, but the defendant has acted abnormally everywhere. Therefore, the presiding judge should impose a severe punishment." Finally, Yu Chengxiu, the lawyer hired by the defendant Ye Fukan, rose to defend him for a long time. The court declared the debate concluded and set the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the tenth of this month. The defendant Ye Fukan remains on his original bail.

### Married Woman Commits Adultery

Zhou Luan, a native of Jiaxing, is 34 years old and works as a clerk at Hangzhou Senior High School. On April 19th, 1926, he married Chen Shiyu (currently 35 years old), also from Jiaxing, in their hometown. They had a daughter together. Later, because Zhou took a job at the Hangzhou High School, they lived separately. Zhou could not return home frequently due to work. Last autumn, Zhou took a vacation and returned to Jiaxing. He heard rumors that his wife, Chen Shiyu, was having an affair with Shi Shichang (24 years old, currently a teacher at Chenguang Elementary School, No. 457, Lane 4, Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai), who was also from their hometown. However, he had no evidence, so he had to suppress his feelings. After his vacation, he took Chen to Hangzhou and rented a residence at No. 25 Niuyangsi Lane. Then, on November 19th last year, Zhou suddenly found Shi Shichang in his home. He reported to the police station and requested that they arrest him, but when the detectives arrived, Shi had already left ten minutes earlier, so they could not catch him. Unexpectedly, on the second of this month, Zhou discovered that Chen had secretly gone to Shanghai, so he followed her to Shanghai. After investigating, he learned that Chen and Shi had rented Room 39 at the Jincheng Hotel, No. 570 Hankou Road, under the alias Chen Zuoliang. He reported to the Laozha Police Station, who dispatched detectives to arrest them. However, both Chen and Shi had already gone out and were not apprehended. Until the day before yesterday, Zhou learned that they had moved to Room 33. Therefore, yesterday morning at 1:15 AM, he accompanied Wang Shusen, a Chinese detective inspector, and Ding Yizhong, a detective, from the Laozha Police Station. They arrested Shi and Chen and confiscated three love letters. They were taken to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court at 9:00 AM. Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, explained the case and filed charges of adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. He also stated that when the two defendants were arrested, Shi Shichang's wife, Tang, was also in the room. She went to urge her husband to return home because she had learned that he was living in a hotel with a woman. However, both defendants denied having committed adultery and requested a trial according to the law. Zhou Luan then submitted a report detailing the investigation and presented the correspondence between the two defendants as evidence. Xu Rongshi, a waiter at the Jincheng Hotel, testified that the two defendants came to open the room together, but Shi did not stay overnight. When questioned, both defendants claimed that they were distant relatives. Chen said that she came to Shanghai this time and Shi accompanied her to various entertainment venues, but there was absolutely no adultery. Chen also claimed that her relationship with Zhou was good, but last year Zhou fell in love with a colleague, Ms. Zhu, and wanted to divorce her, which she refused, leading to disagreements. She also hired lawyer Zhou Yongding to defend her. Judge Pan Zhenyang reviewed the statements and sentenced Shi Shichang to three months of imprisonment for adultery and Zhou and Chen to three months of imprisonment for adultery each, allowing them to commute the sentence to a fine at the rate of two yuan per day. They were allowed to post 180 yuan bail each during the appeal period.

### French Police Crack Down on Counterfeit Money Gang

Nine Suspects, Male and Female, Arrested

Jiang Futian, an inspector, Zhang Daorong, a detective inspector, Bu Zhenglong, Dai Rongji, and Shen Jinshi, detectives of the French Police, received a tip the day before yesterday that someone was privately selling counterfeit money in Room 2 of the Xinxin Hotel, No. 324 Mintiniyin Road. They immediately went there and arrested Wu Rongguang (aka Wu Huasheng, 34 years old, from Dinghai), who was found to be carrying 300 counterfeit Central Bank one-yuan bills, totaling 300 yuan, and 20 counterfeit Bank of China five-yuan bills, totaling 100 yuan. Wu also confessed that his accomplices were hiding on the third floor of Wu Chunji's house, No. 294 across the street. The detectives arrested six people: Chen Erbai (aka Chen Wangshi, 38 years old, from Jiaxing), Tu Yuanhu (33 years old, from Dinghai), Wu Fujin (33 years old, from Dinghai), Hua Chunlin (23 years old, from Zhenjiang), Zhao Jifu (39 years old, from Tongzhou), and Zhu Huaiqing (40 years old, from Pinghu). Chen Erbai was found to be carrying 100 counterfeit Bank of China five-yuan bills, totaling 500 yuan. They were all taken back to the police station. Later, based on the suspects' confessions, they cooperated with detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station and arrested Wang Shisheng (aka Sun Shaoshan, 56 years old, from Suzhou) and Li Mishi (46 years old, from Shandong) at No. 13, Lane 110, Chengdu Road. They were taken back to the French Police Station. It was discovered that Wang Shisheng had previously been sentenced to five years in prison by the Second Special District Court for a counterfeit money case and was released after a sentence reduction in 1933. He resumed his old tricks and continued his counterfeit money business. He confessed that the manufacturing facility was located at No. 1, Lane 126, Huanlong Road, and was privately printed by a certain foreigner. The detectives went to search the house, but it was empty. Neighbors said that the people in the house had moved out a week ago. Yesterday, the police station transferred the nine arrested suspects, male and female, to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Affairs Department, stated the case, saying that the defendants were involved in a case of using counterfeit currency and requested a two-week extension to conduct a detailed investigation before filing charges. Judge Chen Shuoying reviewed the report, briefly questioned the defendants, and adjourned the hearing to April 12th. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Yu Chengchun Shot and Killed in Robbery

Yu Chengchun, a 41-year-old native of Shaoxing, who ran a timber business at No. 457 Tokyo Road, was awakened by several bandits who broke into his home around 2 AM the other morning with the intention of robbing him. Yu got out of bed, intending to capture them, but was shot in a vital area by the bandits and fell to the ground. The bandits fled, realizing they had caused an incident. Yu's wife, Chen, rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital, but he died despite medical treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Fei Lun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang was dispatched by the First Special District Court to the morgue. After confirming that the deceased had died from a gunshot wound, he instructed his wife, Yu Chen, to sign a statement and claim the body for burial.

### Animal Protection Association Requests Ban on Slaughtering Cattle and Catching Frogs

Telegram to Anhui Provincial Government Urging Strict Enforcement

The China Animal Protection Association sent a letter to the Anhui Provincial Government yesterday, requesting that all counties be strictly ordered to ban the slaughtering of cattle and catching of frogs. The letter stated, "Recently, a member, Wang Baigeng, wrote, stating that unscrupulous individuals and ignorant villagers in various counties and townships of your province are slaughtering cattle for plowing and catching field frogs for food. Although the authorities have issued proclamations strictly prohibiting this, the practice of slaughtering cattle and catching frogs has not only not decreased but has become more prevalent. The slaughtering of cattle and catching of frogs has become a common custom in various villages. Please forward this letter to the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting that all counties and townships be strictly ordered to ban the slaughtering of cattle and catching of frogs in order to emphasize agriculture. The slaughtering of cattle and catching of frogs have been explicitly prohibited by central government orders. However, unscrupulous merchants and ignorant people deceive the authorities and slaughter them at will, which has a profound impact on rural areas. We should request that your provincial government immediately order all counties and townships to strictly enforce the ban in order to curb the custom and emphasize agriculture. Please investigate and reply."

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ordered to Screen Patrolmen

Those Laid Off to Receive Compensation and Be Dismissed; Those Retained to Undergo Training

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wharf Management Department, following instructions from the Ministry of Communications, is laying off old Indian patrolmen and screening all patrolmen and inspectors at the wharves to improve management. The screening process has been completed, and an order was issued on March 31st. The screening of patrolmen and inspectors was conducted by an examination committee organized by the heads of each section, using physical fitness, oral knowledge, common sense, and daily performance as screening criteria. A total of twenty-six people failed the screening and were laid off. Subsequently, due to the insufficient number of patrolmen at each wharf, an open examination was held to fill the vacancies, resulting in thirty-five successful candidates and twenty alternates. In addition to reorganizing the patrolmen's structure and assigning the new recruits to various wharves on the first of this month, it is rumored that all new and old patrolmen will be trained to improve the efficiency of the department. As for the patrolmen who have been laid off, it has been decided to provide them with compensation and dismissal to show compassion. Reports that the laid-off patrolmen petitioned the bureau unsuccessfully are not true.

### Three Fires Yesterday

Taiyang Temple Road: At 11:30 AM yesterday, a fire broke out at the home of Jin Wenbin, a native of Yangzhou, at No. 10 Taiyang Temple Road, Zhabei, due to carelessness while burning paper money. Black smoke billowed and flames shot up, destroying the house and spreading to the adjacent house at No. 9. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade. The Yongxing Road Police Station is investigating the person responsible for the fire.

Qingjie Road: A fire broke out at No. 107 Qingjie Road, Hujiabao, Pudong, at 11:50 AM yesterday due to carelessness, resulting in the destruction of one house. The person responsible for the fire is at large.

Xinmin Road: Yin Yongqing, a local resident of Zhabei, at No. 79 Bailu Road, Xinmin Road, was a homeowner of modest means. Yesterday at approximately 4:45 PM, the entire family went out to sweep tombs, and the embers in the house were not extinguished, suddenly causing a fire. The fire was uncontrollable. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after an hour. One house was destroyed.

### High-Quality Domestic Lead Wire

The China Lead Wire Factory, organized by Chen Jingtang and other Shanghai merchants, officially started production on February 15th of this year. By the end of March, it had produced thousands of piculs of goods. The wire drawing is uniform and the colors are bright and eye-catching, which has long been praised by the hardware industry. Wholesale prices were offered for two days, with goods divided into three grades: A, B, and C. All inventory was completely sold out. It is reported that a certain hardware store has pre-ordered more than a thousand piculs of goods for May and June, which are currently being rushed to produce. Many customers are regretting missing out. Because the factory's products are welcomed by the public and demand exceeds supply, it plans to add night shifts starting next month. If necessary, it will convene a board meeting to add machinery in order to increase production to meet demand. This is also a good sign in the promotion of domestic goods.

### Massive Fire at Shengda Flower Factory on Ouyang Road, Zhabei

Burning from 10 PM Last Night to 3 AM This Morning, Total Losses Reaching 150,000 Gold

The Shengda Flower Factory, located at Nos. 136-152 Ouyang Road, Zhabei, is operated by the Shen Ting Foreign Firm on Beijing Road and managed by Bao Guoliang, a native of Ningbo. It specializes in storing and processing cotton. Recently, the factory had a large batch of cotton stored in its warehouses. Unexpectedly, a fire suddenly broke out in the warehouses at approximately 10:45 PM last night, immediately affecting the entire building and spreading to the accounting room on the left and the warehouses upstairs, causing the sky to turn red and sparks to fly everywhere, making it impossible to approach. The Hujiaqiao Fire Brigade, which is in charge of the area, received the news first and immediately dispatched fire trucks to the scene. However, there were no water pipes installed in the area. Fortunately, after Captain Wang Jinshan negotiated with a nearby elementary school, water could be sprayed. At that time, the fire trucks from the Hongzhen and Fourth Section fire brigades also arrived to assist in the firefighting. However, due to the intensity of the fire, little progress was made. By midnight, the factory had been completely burned to ashes, and the internal fire continued to increase until it gradually died down at approximately 3:00 AM this morning. The total losses are estimated to reach 150,000 gold. It is said that only 30,000 yuan in fire insurance was secured. When the fire was raging, Ding Zhonglin, a 34-year-old native of Guangdong (living at No. 51 Jixiang Lane), was watching the fire when the outer wall of the factory collapsed and broke his right leg. At the same time, Lu Dehou, a 40-year-old, was burned all over because his house was affected by the fire and he escaped too slowly. He was immediately sent to Tongren Hospital by the fire brigade. Another firefighter, Zhu Xiaoming, a native of Haimen, was also sent to the hospital for treatment after injuring his waist due to a fall. As for the cause of the fire, it is rumored that it was caused by an electrical short circuit and is currently being investigated by the police station in charge of the area.

Commentary

### The Bodhisattva is Powerless

— Yan

In yesterday's "Foreigners' Superstitions" column, it was stated that "dreams are the subconscious brain activity during sleep," which may have some credibility. The once-popular Scientific Divination Charts, after discussion, are also considered to be a "reflection of the subconscious." However, dreamers seem to only pay attention to their own fortune and misfortune, or to playing lotteries and making some extra money. People who buy Scientific Divination Charts, of course, are asking their ancestors to predict the coming year. This is indeed a subconscious reflection under science; they cannot understand it too much, and the pain of real life makes them further trust the power of dreams and Scientific Divination Charts. Other superstitions are no different.

Almost everyone gathered around the fortune-telling machines is asking when they can find a job, and even though some people clearly know that these "fortune-tellers" are unreliable, they like to hear good things and seek those good things to satisfy—or even stimulate—their "dreams and desires."

When living "fortune-tellers" lose their effectiveness, they turn to dead bodhisattvas, burning incense and praying, traveling to famous mountains. The spring pilgrimage season has arrived. These days on Su Causeway, Maoshan, Langshan and other places, the devout men and women carrying yellow cloth bags with "Pilgrimage and Incense Offering" written on them are probably arriving in droves, more than words can describe. They all have one belief—to ask the Bodhisattva for blessings. But the Bodhisattva is powerless. The Arhat Hall could not even protect itself and was burned to the ground. The incense boats for pilgrimage capsized in Taihu Lake, and the more than ten drowned old women, if they knew in death, would probably regret it too late. (But some say it's because they weren't pious enough, which only heaven knows.)

In this day and age, life is really too unsatisfactory, even kneeling and kowtowing to people is useless, and it is already "not allowed to kowtow." As the saying goes, "It is better to rely on oneself than to rely on others," let alone fortune-tellers and bodhisattvas?

### The Meadow

— Luo Quan

The withered yellow sunlight shines into the attic from the top corner of the window. I spread out my five fingers, and the black coal dust marks are still on my fingers. I support my drowsy head, and roll up my soft and paralyzed eyes to look at the ancient and worn-out dusk.

Outside the window, the corners of other people's houses are scattered and slanted. My window is right under other people's eaves and on the walls, not even leaving a sky. Houses that don't let people breathe!

So I think of the meadow under the window. Like a withered and melancholic person, year after year he wears a gray-yellow sack, and his body is thrown with broken copper and scrap iron, and melon rinds and fruit shells, so piles of garbage mountains accumulate, pressing on the meadow's chest. Green flies and mosquitoes gather on his pale gray skin, on the festering sores. He seems to stretch out a part of his head, looking up at my window, his body blocked by the houses in front of the window. But what can I throw?

I have nothing, I have nothing!

So I think of myself. A pitiful thing, also a leftover person in the world.

My body is weak and thin, I can't shake big stones, but I'm used to the smell of coal smoke. I calculate small amounts of money to get through the difficult days. Because I accidentally stumbled into this remote city corner, but heard these words:

"That little pigeon coop is as cheap as two foreign dollars. It has a window, and there's a meadow outside the window."

Even the dogs on the street with their tails between their legs have a kennel, I thought. So, in the daytime, I am shouted at, and in the evening, I return here.

Every evening, I come back from outside with fatigue and resentment, unlock the door with the key, and fall in as if fainting, but the room is only cool and dark.

I picked a tin can from the wall hole and drank a mouthful of white water to moisten my dry throat, then fell on the bed and covered my head with my hands to sleep.

But I can't sleep, and the coughing starts again. I have long endured the stabbing pain in my chest, and I know the reason for the coughing. I try to hold my throat, but thick phlegm piles up one by one, blocking my throat.

So I shake myself up from the bed, I grope and find the window, I spit a mouthful of phlegm at the meadow, and the phlegm is covered with countless bright red blood streaks, I know.

The days flow by slowly like a turbid river.

Those who come out of the stables, those who come out from under the chimneys, those unemployed who wander on the streets, all endure the days like me.

Gathering in this festering city corner, eating and drinking from the unclean ditches, they are infected with incurable diseases.

Now, I am sitting in front of the window swallowing my dinner again. I shift my weak eyes from my bloodless arms, and I softly look at the meadow shrouded in the dusk.

An old man carrying a tin can appears from the corner of someone's house with a silent figure. Leaning on a crutch, walking shallowly and deeply, looking down at his own steps: no, he is looking for something that has been abandoned on the meadow.

He bends down to the meadow once, and disappears in another corner of the house with a silent figure.

A dilapidated door of someone's house flashes open. A child who is doing an adult's job leads his blind old mother out of the door, staggering.

"People who are not like ghosts, they want to die, let him die a world," a complaining voice.

"Dad is angry. ——Mom, can't find the wooden comb, it's getting dark." The child who is not like a child said, bending over and groping on the grass.

Resentment, resenting this world that doesn't let people live! Was it that rude man who hit that blind woman again?

"Why is it getting dark? After that fall, the window was just opened."

The child leans up from the meadow, presses his back with his hand, but doesn't say a word. He reaches out to support the old woman behind him, but shakes his head.

"No! Damn it. The dog bit it away."

Pushing the door open and going in, a line of terribly yellow light flashes, and then it's all black again.

People, without gentleness, loving to curse, loving violent tempers, have become beasts, people will eat people, and tear the skin and flesh to pieces. I think.

I coughed again, and spit a mouthful of phlegm at the meadow; the phlegm is covered with countless bright red blood streaks, I seem to see.

It's getting dark.

### Temple Keeper

— Liu Wang

The wide and straight canal, like a giant python, swam past this place, suddenly curving its body, forming an arc. Here stands a high and long stone bridge with "arched openings," appearing quite old, probably built hundreds of years ago. When people pass by, none do not complain of fatigue from climbing those dozens of stone steps, and none do not feel their legs weaken when standing at the bridge's end, looking down at the river. Natural terrain combined with human effort has created an excellent "feng shui" spot.

According to the age-old customs of people, they always like to build temples or the like in places with good feng shui. Of course, this place would not lack one. The only difference is that the temple here is slightly dilapidated. The temple has no land, and the temple keeper is an old man who used to beg for a living. Because of certain conveniences, he lives here and is unwilling to move away, and no one has ever thought of asking him to scram.

The temple is poor, so the temple keeper naturally has to rely on his old methods to make a living. It's just that now he no longer needs to carry a broken basket, hang a bamboo stick, and go to villages to beg from door to door. Thanks to the convenience of the canal and the arched bridge, he came up with another new way.

Using some tattered yellow cloth (perhaps the curtains from in front of the shrine), he sewed it into a bag. A very long rope was tied to the bag, and the other end of the rope was wrapped around a slender bamboo pole. Every morning, when the sky was still dim, he would crawl out of his straw nest and tattered cotton pile, take the bag, sit on the end of the bridge, and quietly wait for a boat to pass by.

——Smooth sailing and great profit…

——Business prospers across the four seas, wealth flourishes…

If a boat were coming, he would hum the auspicious words he had memorized, while extending the bamboo pole to lower the bag, until the bag reached the boat, so that the boat's crew could reach it with their hands. He would constantly shake the bag, his dazed eyes watching the boat crew's movements eagerly.

Boatmen are most superstitious, liking to take auspicious omens. Even if they don't encounter smooth sailing, they always hope for it, just like the temple keeper's blessings: if it really were smooth sailing, they would certainly not be stingy with a penny's worth of alms.

After the boatman put the copper coins into the bag, the temple keeper would put on a comforting smile and slowly raise the bamboo pole. Letting his gnarled hand reach into the cloth bag to retrieve the coins, he would immediately hide them in his bib pocket. Then he would sit back down on the stone railing, quietly waiting for other boats.

There were also boats that didn't give money, mostly Jiangbei people's small boats, or business boats returning after suffering losses. But if he encountered cargo ships fully loaded with rice and grain, or paper goods ships piled high with tin foil and incense sticks, or large pig boats, then he would not only not be disappointed, but sometimes the generosity of the boatmen would even surprise him, making him tremble. Especially when it was the "incense pilgrimage" season, when Buddhist women went boatload after boatload to "worship the mountains and offer incense," his income would be even more considerable.

In the evening of the day, he would take out the copper coins from his bib pocket and carefully count them over and over again. Then, with a satisfied heart, he would drag the bamboo pole back to the dilapidated temple.

For several years, his life had been maintained like this.

But recently, an unexpected event disrupted his peaceful days. In the canal, twice a day, steamships rushed back and forth, and far away he would see a wisp of gray-black smoke drifting, and soon he would hear it "pat, pat, pat" as it headed in the other direction. The soil on both sides of the canal was impacted by it time and time again, and the mud and sand at the bottom of the river stirred up the originally clear water.

When the steamships first started running, the temple keeper felt nothing but surprise. He also lowered the cloth bag as he would for every ordinary boat. But what happened in the end was that he was disappointed every time. Before he could lower the bag to the ship, the monster had already passed through the bridge opening. Once, he didn't know which passenger played a prank and even tore off his cloth bag. From then on, the temple keeper's despair turned into hatred.

"Toot toot toot"

When the steamship's whistle blew in the distance, he would start cursing:

——Heartless foreign devil thing, like a turtle! Toot, toot, toot my [expletive].

It was not until the steamship had sailed far away and could no longer be seen clearly that the temple keeper would stroke his beard slowly, as if in victory, and stop cursing.

The steamship was, after all, the temple keeper's enemy. It not only disturbed his usual tranquility but also affected a large part of his income. Since it appeared, cargo ships, large pig boats, etc., were all towed behind the steamships, speeding past as if flying, no longer paying attention to his auspicious words.

The cold evening wind was even sharper, causing the water in the canal to rustle loudly. His pale hair was blown into a mess, and his body trembled incessantly. Seeing that the sky was about to darken, but his bib pocket was still empty, he could not help but shed two lines of sad, clear tears.
