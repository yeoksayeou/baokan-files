In the evening, Shaanxi fellow provincials and classmates in Beijing, together with Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai fellow provincials in Beijing, held a joint banquet. It is reported that Sun's visit to Beijing this time is due to the fact that since the Shaanxi Incident, three months of taxes have not been collected. In the past, local finances were extremely difficult, and a considerable amount of funds had already been diverted from local banks. In addition to seeking instructions from President Chiang, he will also discuss remedial measures with Finance Minister Kong in the coming days. Regarding the past financial situation of the province and the budget for local revenue and expenditure in the future, Sun has prepared a list and a summary budget for Kong to review. Once everything is in order, he will return to Shaanxi to preside over affairs. He plans to return to Shaanxi within three or four days. Before returning to Shaanxi, he still needs to go to Shanghai to talk to Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, regarding financial matters. According to those around Sun, the past financial situation in Shaanxi Province was such that before the cessation of tobacco tax, there was an annual shortfall of more than one million yuan. After the strict prohibition of opium and the cancellation of more than three million yuan in taxes, the shortfall was approximately five million yuan. As for the Shaanxi Incident, there were no other impacts, except that merchants suffered some losses. Currently, the price of each bag of flour is approximately 5.60 or 5.70 yuan, having risen to a maximum of 6.10 yuan. Apart from luxury goods being more expensive, everything else is gradually returning to normal. (Special dispatch on the 28th)

However, there is no precedent for refusing to accept foreign goods for customs declaration. How should we audit the foreign goods that continue to come in the future? Please give instructions. Since the goods reported by the customs include foreign goods, in order to prevent problems before they occur, the customs should send personnel to investigate the transportation of foreign goods via other routes and coordinate tax collection measures to prevent malpractices.

### HSBC Holds Annual Meeting

Chairman Praises China's Progress

(Hong Kong) HSBC held its annual meeting on Saturday. Mr. Patterson, the chairman of the bank, presided over the meeting. Mr. Patterson said in his speech that the atmosphere of international trade is still bleak, which is well known. The current prosperity of world commerce is artificially created rather than natural, and many countries lack a genuine basis for the word "prosperity." If we do not quickly find a way to correct certain basic economic factors that the public knows are off track, then the new wave of prosperity will disappear like a deflated balloon. Mr. Patterson then mentioned China and praised President Chiang Kai-shek, the National Government, the Ministry of Railways, and the Customs. He said that in the past year, China has shown brightness everywhere. China's financial and commercial atmosphere has greatly improved compared with the past. Mr. Patterson then talked about the business situation of HSBC last year, saying that after deducting losses and unexpected expenses, the net profit was 15,107,175 yuan, plus the 3,327,060 yuan carried over from the previous year. After deducting the dividends issued in the previous period, calculated at 1 shilling and 3 pence 3125, totaling 400,000 pounds sterling, and the bonuses issued to directors, there was still a remaining balance of 12,085,327 yuan. The current proposal is to distribute the following: a final dividend of 3 pounds per share, totaling 70,744,537 yuan, 1,000,000 yuan will be allocated to the bank's housing, and 3,340,789 yuan will be carried over to next year's accounts. Mr. Patterson also mentioned the silver problem, saying that silver has not been abandoned by China, but the future influence of silver seems extremely small. Mr. Patterson said at the end that everything has been considered and consulted. If China can complete and earnestly implement its internal reform procedures, then there seem to be various reasons to trust China's current currency system.

### 鼠食貓

Zhejiang Lin'an. It is not surprising that cats eat rats, but it is indeed a strange thing for rats to eat cats. However, this is absolutely true. There are many rats in the local area, and they are unusually large and not afraid of cats. According to eyewitnesses, several cats have been killed by them. The process is quite surprising. It is said that after a group of rats encounters a cat, one rat, much like a suicide squad in the army, steps forward and suddenly attacks. This immediately attracts the attention of the other rats, who immediately surround the cat and kill it. Therefore, the number of cats in the area is particularly small. (Translated from foreign reports by the Foreign Affairs Society)

### 京紫霞洞發現古墓

(Nanjing) The Nanjing Mausoleum Administration excavated soil near the Zixia Cave reservoir last winter for construction purposes. Five stone Buddha statues were unearthed in the soil, but because their heads were broken off, it was suspected that they had been discarded, so they were left unattended. Later, several pieces of broken bricks were unearthed, but they were also not investigated further because they were considered broken bricks and tiles. Later, due to the cold weather, construction was suspended and soil excavation was stopped. Recently, construction has resumed. On the 26th, a large number of bricks were unearthed at the original location. After inspection by engineers, it was determined that it was an ancient tomb. The tomb is located between Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Mausoleum and the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, with a small hill rising above it and surrounded by pine and cypress trees. The location is extremely secluded and inaccessible to tourists. The upper corner of the tomb chamber has been excavated. The tomb bricks are about five inches high, more than a foot wide, and more than two feet long, without patterns. The top of the tomb is also made of bricks, with a thickness of six layers, with the upper and lower layers each having three bricks stacked in a staggered pattern. The outside of the tomb is arched, which is quite peculiar. A chamber can be seen from the crack, with a depth and width of more than two zhang (approximately 20 feet). Unfortunately, the roof of the chamber has not been fully excavated, so the entire chamber cannot be seen. Moreover, the bottom of the chamber is deeply flooded, making it difficult to enter the chamber to explore. It is said that there is another chamber inside, similar in size, with two stone doors taller than a person. The doors are flexible and can be entered. Inside, there is a stone table with patterns that are roughly identifiable. The doors, tables, and other places are painted with red lacquer, and the color is still visible. The lime on the brick walls has been eroded over time, with many white lines running down the walls, which feel sticky when touched. The management office is now taking measures to protect it pending verification. (28th day Central News Agency dispatch)

(Guangzhou) The Guangdong Zhongda Research Institute unearthed an ancient tomb buried in the soil on Yougang, Dengfeng Road, in the suburbs on the 28th.

Current Commentary

### 願政府積極扶植言論界星

In recent years, there have been many opinions expressed by people from all walks of life regarding the issue of freedom of speech. However, none have been more insightful than the remarks made by Chairman Chiang on the 22nd. With a few simple and clear words, he elucidated the central government's policy on public opinion, the drawbacks of past news policies, and the path that the press should take in the future. In particular, his expectation that "the central government should further improve the management of news and publications and should further support the development of the press and publishing industry" has been applauded by the press throughout the country. Now that the highest leader has made such a statement that conforms to public opinion, if the whole country acts in accordance with this principle and makes active efforts, it will not only be the good fortune of the press, but also the good fortune of the people.

Freedom of speech is stipulated in the constitution. Party leaders have also expressed their views on rewarding the good and eliminating the bad in the newspaper industry. In this time of serious national crisis, the current task of the press is to concentrate its will, promote the movement for national salvation and survival, create a national consciousness that unites the country, strive for national freedom and equality, and work hard on national economic and cultural construction. All newspapers, whether government-run or commercial, as long as they are not tools of traitors and bandits, should have the same goal. Today, the development of China's news industry is difficult due to various material, cultural, and social limitations. The existing structure can only be improved day by day, and there is no reason to destroy, cripple, or oppress it. Therefore, rewarding the good must be used as a means of eliminating the bad, and supporting must be used as a purpose of correcting. If a purely negative approach is used, both sides will be hurt, the country will suffer losses, and the government will not be able to deal with the aftermath.

Today, there are many things that the press relies on the government to actively support, whether in terms of material, talent, or tools. The government should understand the difficulty of producing newspapers and the necessity of a sound press organization in this extraordinary period. There is no reason to stand idly by. The decline of the newspaper industry is mostly due to economic difficulties. The Chinese people are poor, and their purchasing power is weak. Newspapers do not dare to raise prices. China's commerce is declining, and the amount of advertising is small and the prices are low. Newspapers do not dare to ask too much from advertisers. However, the machinery of newspaper offices is imported. The paper used by newspaper offices is also imported. The price is very high. In recent months, the price of paper has risen sharply. The survival of newspapers, except for a few with a long history and sound economic organization, is in a precarious state. If the government does not reduce tariffs on the issue of paper, so that its price is reduced, or establish paper mills early to supply newspapers at low prices, this issue will inevitably become a major obstacle to the future of the newspaper industry. This is one aspect of the economy, and it is also the most important aspect.

The lack of talent is also the greatest difficulty felt by private newspapers. Large-scale talent training cannot be done without the power of the government. The difficulty of news gathering and the arrogance of foreign news agencies are also well known by the government and the public. The organization of large-scale international communication agencies is also a cause that the government should promote. Telegraph wires and radio waves are used by newspapers to obtain news, and their prices should be further reduced. Railways and airplanes are used by newspapers for transportation, and the press should be given preferential treatment. In various countries in the East and West, postal, telecommunications, and transportation agencies provide newspapers with meticulous preferential treatment. Only in this way can the newspaper industry develop, and only in this way can a sound public opinion be created. We do not force the government to fulfill various obligations while forgetting our own obligations. The newspaper industry is fundamentally different from other profit-making businesses. If individuals want to make big profits and get rich, then the Shanghai Bund, department stores, cotton textiles, and flour mills are all possibilities for making money. Why must they engage in the newspaper industry, which is dangerous, unprofitable, and has little profit? The newspaper industry is a public undertaking, a cultural undertaking, and is of the same nature as running schools and doing charity. Those who run newspapers should not have profit as their sole purpose. Therefore, the government should not regard the newspaper industry as a general industry. This is what the newspaper industry should particularly encourage itself to do, and it is why the government should particularly cherish and support newspapers.

What is the situation today? Except for a few reputable newspapers, most newspapers do not have enough income to support themselves. Those who are eager to make profits have to lower their standards. The talent they use cannot but be sought below the standard. The advertisements they publish cannot but be sought below the level of social interest. The news they publish cannot but be sought below the level of middle-class taste. What is even more pitiful is that newspapers are used for various actions that cannot be justified. Just look at the balance sheets of many inferior newspapers. Does the amount of their expenditures have 100% of its income from normal newspaper sales and legitimate advertising? If the government only restricts news and restricts operations, without opening up a broad road for the news industry, how is it any different from climbing a tree to catch fish to eliminate bad situations? From now on, we hope that the news management agencies will uphold the promise of the highest leader and actively support the press. Then the newspapers will be fortunate, and the party and the country will be fortunate.

### 桑島赴任前視察荷印

(Tokyo) The new Japanese Minister to the Netherlands, Kazue Kuwashima, is scheduled to go to The Hague to take office in the coming days. However, because the Dutch East Indies has an important relationship with the Dutch government in diplomatic negotiations, Foreign Minister Hayashi decided that the minister should first inspect various parts of the Dutch East Indies before taking office. The minister is scheduled to depart on the 28th, going directly to the Dutch East Indies via Singapore. He will travel to various parts of the Dutch East Indies, such as Batavia and Surabaya, to inspect the actual situation of politics and economics and the activities of the Japanese, so as to provide resources for future diplomatic negotiations. In particular, various parts of Southeast Asia misunderstand Japan's southward policy and have territorial ambitions. Therefore, the minister will meet with Governor-General Sterelaralgenbau and Economic Officer Balde of the Dutch East Indies, as well as experts from all walks of life, to correct their misunderstandings and fully listen to the opinions of the Dutch East Indies. The minister is scheduled to return to China in mid-April to report on the inspection and take office in mid-May. (28th day Allied News dispatch)

### 德日防共協定臻實際行動階段

Determined to formally invite Italy to participate, the Japan-Italy Trade Agreement will be established soon.

(Tokyo) After the Japan-Germany Standing Committee, established on January 21 in accordance with the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact, convened four meetings, it has entered the stage of actual action. The Japanese members of the Standing Committee, namely Kojiro Inoue, counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Germany, Kobayashi, official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the German member, namely Heqi, Deputy Minister of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reached a compromise after consultation and decided to formally suggest to Italy to participate in the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact in accordance with Article 2 of the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. The new Japan-Italy Trade Agreement is currently under negotiation and is expected to be signed in mid-March. It is generally believed here that the friendship between the Japanese and Italian authorities is becoming more and more cordial, and the invitation to Italy to join the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact will definitely be successful in the future. If Italy does join the pact, Austria-Hungary and countries in Asia will also receive the same invitation. In this way, the confrontation between the world's two major camps will be further intensified. However, the possibility of Italy joining the Anti-Comintern Pact is still doubtful.

### 滬日商工會會長開陳對華意見

China's political and economic progress is rapid, urging the government and the public to change their policies towards China.

(Tokyo) Tadashi Yoshida, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and manager of the Shanghai branch of Mitsubishi Bank of Japan, has now published a booklet by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which contains frank opinions on China's economic control, Sino-Japanese political and economic relations, and the Japanese people's understanding of China. It is worthy of attention. In the booklet, Yoshida strongly urges the Japanese government and the public to take advantage of the current opportunity to completely change their understanding of China. He also lists many examples of the errors in Japan's policies towards China. Yoshida points out that the Chinese National Government has completely gained control of finance and economics. He also says that Japan believes that the rise and fall of the National Government is related to the so-called Jiangsu-Zhejiang financiers, but the current National Government can enjoy the economic benefits of the whole country. This is unprecedented in Chinese history. Japan feels that China lacks unity and believes that the Chinese people are like scattered sand that cannot be united. However, the sand has now become as solid as cement. This should be attributed to the reaction to the oppression of Japan and other countries. Yoshida then criticizes some Japanese people's views that China's financial situation is unstable, and asserts that China's financial situation is now stable, which can be proved by the international payment and great improvement. At the same time, he puts forward two points that the Chinese government should reconsider: ㊀ The concentration of central finance, the accumulation of funds in Shanghai and Nanjing is too large, while the provinces are neglected; ㊁ Excessive reliance on foreign countries. Yoshida then expressed pessimism when talking about the future of Sino-Japanese relations, predicting that economic cooperation is impossible. After various political and cultural relations between China and Japan are completely on the verge of rupture, Japan should maintain friendship with China through economic cooperation. However, Japan has adopted the opposite policy, which has led to the decline of Japan's economic relations with China, such as Japan's attitude towards China's currency reform in 1935 and the so-called special trade in North China. Japan may think its attitude is reasonable, but China feels that this attitude is extremely unreasonable and incomprehensible. The major powers are now striving to create new opportunities to cope with the new situation, while Japan is standing idly by. Regarding the old saying of economic cooperation, Yoshida said that this kind of cooperation is only possible when China is still in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state and China is still a primitive agricultural country. However, China's political and economic situation has recently made rapid progress, which has resulted in the Chinese people having a sincere feeling for their destiny. In addition, the advantage of the European and American forces in China has made Sino-Japanese relations worse than before. Yoshida concludes by advocating that Japan should not ignore the situation and be indifferent, but must find ways to improve relations with China. Yoshida finally warns that Japan must eliminate its severe policies towards China and adopt policies that are morally acceptable to the Chinese government and are practical. He also says that it is absurd for Japan to accuse China of disregarding sincerity or adopting a policy of attacking from afar, because Japanese diplomacy and government authorities must also bear part of the responsibility. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)

### Japanese Parliament Enters Third Phase of Battle

Budget Committee Opens Subcommittees, Manchurian Incident Secret Expenses Questioned by Representatives of the People's Government Party

(Tokyo) The parliament on the 28th, only the House of Representatives opened subcommittees simultaneously after 10 a.m., with only preliminary questioning battles on the first day, so all adjourned after noon, and will enter the third phase of battle tomorrow (28th, Domei News).

(Tokyo) The House of Representatives' budget committee, which has been debating for ten days since the 17th, completed its questioning on the 27th. Although the 28th was a Sunday, the budget subcommittees opened simultaneously at 10 a.m. The budgets of various ministries are managed separately in the subcommittees, and deliberations will be conducted until March 3rd. During this period of questioning, the government will clarify why the electricity control bill and the compulsory education extension bill were not submitted to this parliament, and the issue of increased funding will also be resolved. The budget committee will reconvene on March 4th, the parties will decide their attitudes on the 5th, and the budget bill will be voted on on the 6th (28th, Domei News).

(Tokyo) When the Japanese budget committee's fourth subcommittee discussed military expenses today, a representative of the People's Government Party questioned that 7 million yen was used to expand secret expenses in the Manchurian Incident expenses, asking what the purpose was. Another representative of the People's Government Party pointed out that Japan's annual military secret expenses do not exceed 270,000 yen, but the total amount of secret expenses in the Manchurian Incident expenses has reached a huge 48 million yen in the five years since 1932. He went on to say that if the rumor that most of these secret expenses were reinvested in our country for political purposes is true, it would be completely contrary to the original mission of the army. Vice Minister of the Army Umezu Mijiro replied that the secret expenses of the Manchurian Incident should be clearly distinguished from the secret expenses of "Manchukuo," and that none of the expenditures were contrary to the original purpose, and that it was extremely inaccurate that such funds were used for domestic affairs. A representative of the People's Government Party also asked how far the division could be increased, and whether the domestic army would be reduced after the division stationed in Manchuria was increased. Umezu replied that it was difficult to clearly explain whether or not the division would be increased at present, but it was a fact that the army's military strength would be increased, and that the increase in military strength in Manchuria would not reduce the military strength in the country. Looking at the above Q&A, two doubts can be found: first, what exactly was the nearly 10 million yen used for secret expenses in Manchuria in the past five years? Second, the new budget has included military expansion expenses, so how much will the number of Japanese troops increase? (Central News, 28th)

### New Army Funding Request

Minister of the Army Attends to Explain

(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Sugiyama explained in detail the new funding request for the annual army budget and its contents at the fourth subcommittee of the budget on the 28th. The main points are as follows:

㊀ 234,728 (units in thousands of yen, same below) for the improvement and maintenance of military equipment in Manchuria, i.e., improving, increasing, and maintaining the naval, land, and air forces in China and Manchuria, dispatching some divisions, and relocating some units returning to the mainland.

㊁ 102.188 for the improvement of aviation and air defense, enhancing aviation and air defense replenishment, education, training, and expanding staff training centers, is a continuing project from the 12th year to the 18th year, with a total amount of 352,834,000 yen.

㊂ 24.741 for the improvement of military equipment, increasing military strength, improving organization, increasing stationed troops, and improving anti-Vance, anti-air, anti-tank communication and other facilities, etc., is a continuing project from the 12th year to the 18th year, with a total amount of more than 138,070,000 yen.

㊃ 40.000 for material preparation, preparing operational materials, is a continuing project from the 12th year to the 18th year, with a total amount of 900 million yen.

㊄ 8.237 for other general new items (28th, Kokumin News).

### Japanese Covet New Guinea Island

Representatives of the People's Government Party Propose Demanding that the Netherlands Cede It

(Nanjing) When the first subcommittee of the Japanese budget committee met today to discuss the expenses of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs under the budget, Sakurai Hyogoro, a representative of the People's Government Party, proposed that Japan demand that the Netherlands permanently cede New Guinea Island in the Dutch East Indies. Sakurai said that the territory of New Guinea Island is more extensive than the Japanese mainland, but it has not yet been developed, which is extremely unreasonable, and asked whether the government has the courage to frankly demand that the Netherlands permanently cede the island and its neighboring islands in order to solve the Japanese population problem. Sakurai believes that Japan has no other plans in the South Sea Islands other than this. If this plan can be successful, peace can be maintained forever, and Japan and the Dutch East Indies can conclude a non-aggression treaty. When Prime Minister Hayashi replied, he generally expressed agreement with Sakurai's opinion, and said that the government has not yet reached the stage of studying the issue of ceding New Guinea, but will use your opinion as a reference to start studying the issue (28th, Central News Agency).

### Issue of Cash Export

Specific Details of the Content

(Tokyo) Finance Minister Yuki replied to the question of Oko Kiroku of the Seiyukai at the third subcommittee of the budget on the 28th. Regarding the issue of cash export, he revealed the government's beliefs and stated that cash export will not use gold coins but gold bars, cash export will be carried out with government bills, and cash export does not necessarily require devaluation. The Ministry of Finance is currently consulting with the Bank of Japan and the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the specific details can be determined within a few days. The contents are roughly as follows:

㊀ The method of cash export is determined to be carried out according to government calculations. The destination of cash export is New York, and gold bars will be exported in fractions several times at any time.

㊀ The timing of cash export is approximately from March 10th to 15th.

㊀ The amount of cash export is approximately 15 million yen for the first time, but in the future, the scheduled cash export must reach 200 million to 300 million yen.

㊀ Disposal of profits from the Bank of Japan: The profits obtained by the Bank of Japan due to cash export will be disposed of appropriately in the future.

㊀ Issue of currency devaluation: The currency has actually been devalued, and the procedures for legalizing it are also very easy, but there is no need for it now.

㊀ Issue of gold purchase price: The issue of raising the gold purchase price may occur in the future, but there is no need for it today (28th, Domei News).

### Japan Will Follow Our Country in Issuing Aviation Lottery Tickets

(Tokyo) The Aviation Promotion Association, organized around retired and reserve generals, believes that the aviation and air defense industries are urgent and large, and cannot be satisfied only by the state's budget, so it has drafted an aviation industry incentive bill, which will be submitted to both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. The content is to organize a legal entity to issue patriotic aviation lottery tickets, each ticket costs three yen, and six issues are issued a year, totaling 36 million yen, 12 million shares. The prize money is 12 million yen per year, and the rest goes to the government. There are five first prizes of 50,000 yen, fifteen second prizes of 10,000 yen, five hundred third prizes of 1,000 yen, ten thousand fourth prizes of 100 yen, and one hundred thousand fifth prizes of 5 yen. Approximately one in eighteen people will win a prize (28th, Domei News).

### Internal Disputes of the Seiyukai Resolved

With the unanimous approval of the general meeting of members, the party's internal disputes since President Suzuki expressed his intention to resign on the 15th have been resolved satisfactorily (28th, Domei News).

### Sudden Slowdown of Nippon Yusen Kaisha Sailors

Planned by the Tokyo Meirokai, Apparently with an Overly Radical Ideological Background

(Tokyo) The Yusen Meirokai, organized by the core sailors of Nippon Yusen, accused the company of failing to fly flags to celebrate the naval review held by the company in the Hanshin area last autumn. On the 28th, they submitted a request in the name of the general representative of the Meirokai, and at the same time, the association's office issued instructions to the ships departing from Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe on the 28th to stop sailing. Therefore, the "Katori Maru" scheduled to depart from Yokohama, the "Anyo Maru" departing from Osaka, and the "Shanghai Maru" departing from Kobe had to postpone their departure. The "Kasagi Maru" and "Nagasaki Maru," which were scheduled to depart on the same day, also received the same order to stop sailing.

Three Requests Submitted

The contents of the request:

㊀ Hope to clarify the responsibility for the disrespect issue, eliminate the root of the disaster and utilitarianism, and resolutely rectify the company's discipline. ㊀ In order to establish a guiding spirit based on Japanism, immediately carry out a complete reform of the maritime department, etc., and two other articles.

Company's Attitude

President Otani, Vice President Watanabe, and Standing Director Shimizu of the Nippon Yusen headquarters, who were thrown into chaos by the sudden strike of senior sailors guided by the Meirokai, contacted various branches to collect information and discuss countermeasures. President Otani informally expressed the company's attitude towards this dispute as follows: The senior sailor group of this Meirokai suddenly claimed that there was an act of disrespect during the naval review last autumn, which led to the dispute, which is unbelievable. The company acted in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Communications at that time. If there was any mistake, it should protest to the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Communications. In addition, the Meirokai group has an ideological group behind it, and there is a fact that people with overly radical ideas have formed a group and acted. This can be seen from the fact that senior sailors who landed ashore were imprisoned at the time of the dispute. The company will never recognize this Meirokai. Even if a few senior sailors disembark, it will not matter. The ships scheduled to depart will definitely be allowed to depart. Although the "Katori Maru" was delayed due to the rain on the 27th, it will definitely depart on the day of loading (28th, Domei News).

Branch Executes Orders

⊙Osaka: The Osaka branch of the Meirokai received a report from the Tokyo Nippon Yusen Meirokai headquarters on the 28th regarding the submission of a request to the company and an order to stop sailing. It immediately convened more than 30 members at the Mishima Inn in Osaka City, responded to each other under the guidance of the headquarters, and contacted senior sailors scattered throughout the country in order to achieve the request. An executive of the association issued a statement saying that if even one request cannot be achieved, it will remain immovable and insist on reforming the company's claims under the imperial spirit, betting on its family and life (28th, Domei News).

(Tokyo) The ships belonging to Nippon Yusen that were scheduled to depart on the 28th and were suspended from departure due to the Meirokai's order to stop sailing totaled seven in Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe. In addition, the "Shanghai Maru," which received the order to stop sailing, lifted the order because it heard that Count Otani Kouchou was on board and sailed to Shanghai (28th, Domei News).

Seamen's Union Exercises Self-Restraint

(Yokohama) Since the Meirokai began planning, the headquarters of the Japanese Seamen's Union held a meeting of the leading members on the 28th. Due to the many unclear points about the Meirokai's purpose, it issued instructions to the branches of each union to exercise self-restraint and caution, and not to be taken advantage of by the Meirokai's planning this time. The Meirokai was established in Showa 10 (1935) and is organized by second and third officers, engineers, and radio technicians, etc. It has 500 members and was created for the purpose of promoting transparency and improving welfare within the company (28th, Domei News).

### US Commissioner to the Philippines Sworn In

Roosevelt and Quezon Witness the Oath

(Washington) The newly appointed US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Maynard, was sworn in today in the office of Woodring, Secretary of War. President Roosevelt and Philippine President Quezon were both present to witness the oath. Afterwards, President Quezon spoke to reporters and denied that he intended to run for re-election, saying that the Philippine constitution restricts the president from running for re-election, which he advocated. As for the gold mining in the Philippines, it has made great progress (27th, Kokumin News).

### Issue of Negotiating the Rome Treaty Britain Urges Italy and Germany to Reply

Germany Makes Colonial Demands to Britain Ribbentrop Returns Home to Report

(Berlin)

Regarding the issue of the New Locarno Pact, after the British government submitted notes to France, Belgium, Italy, and Germany for the second time, the German and Italian governments have not yet submitted replies. The British authorities are extremely concerned and have once again urged Germany through diplomatic channels. The Frankfurter Zeitung commented that there are still many obstacles to concretizing this matter. "The reason why Britain advocates the establishment of this treaty is said to be to obtain guarantees to prevent foreign aggression. In fact, after the general staffs of Britain and France established mutual assistance measures, France has already given it a guarantee, so why seek others? It can be seen that Britain's insistence on the New Locarno Pact is obviously for other purposes. In addition, Britain and France have different views on general European issues. France is most concerned about Eastern Europe, followed by the Mediterranean. Britain focuses on the Mediterranean, followed by Central Europe, and then Eastern Europe. Does Britain intend for Germany to participate in negotiations regardless of whether Britain has any concrete suggestions? The country almost believes that the solution to general European issues is better than the establishment of a treaty between Britain, France, and Germany, so that when disputes arise in the Mediterranean in the future, its nature will be more serious than last year's Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and the country can have nothing to fear?" (28th, Havas News)

(London) German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop returned to Berlin by plane today. He will participate in the Leipzig Spring Fair and give a speech entitled "Germany's Wishes for World Trade" (27th, Kokumin News).

(London) German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop returned to his country by special train today, ostensibly to give a speech in Leipzig, but it is known that he will report to Hitler on the results of his discussion with British Foreign Secretary Eden last Friday on Germany's colonial demands (27th, Kokumin News).

### Belgian Prime Minister Travels Abroad

⊙Brussels: Prime Minister of Belgium has left the capital, and the outside world does not know where he is going (28th, Havas News).

(Paris) The Paris Morning Post recently reported that the Prime Minister of Belgium has gone to Switzerland and may come to Paris on his way back to the country to meet with key figures in French political circles to discuss the issue of the New Locarno Pact (28th, Havas News).

### Dutch Military Spending Increases Sharply

Strengthening Naval and Air Force Power Budget Approved by the Upper House

⊙Amsterdam: The Dutch Upper House today approved the national defense budget. Prime Minister Colin gave a speech before the vote, declaring that the national defense expenditure in 1936 and 1937 increased by 89 million guilders compared with 1935, of which 29 million was for naval expenditure. Eight submarines are under construction, and 100 military aircraft will also be completed. Colin declared that if the Netherlands does not take necessary measures after the completion of the Franco-Belgian defense line, the Netherlands will become a battlefield once war breaks out. He also said that the status of the Dutch East Indies is also different from the past, so the Netherlands must bear huge national defense costs. The Prime Minister opposed the issuance of public debt, and he pointed out that the increased national defense expenditure should be allocated from regular income (27th, Kokumin News).

### British Naval Exercises in the Mediterranean

⊙Malta: The British Mediterranean Fleet departed from here today to hold winter exercises as usual (27th, Kokumin News).

### Spanish Rebels Bomb Capital

Suburban Militia Advances and Is Defeated

⊙Madrid: The government army authorities issued a battle report stating that the rebel artillery had fired on the central area of the city, and the damage to the city was very serious, but the exact number of casualties has not yet been ascertained. In addition, the artillery of both sides is currently bombarding each other in the area of Guadarrama and Somosa Mountains north of the city (28th, Havas News).

⊙Madrid: Our reporter's special dispatch, at 3:45 pm today, the National Army artillery bombarded the capital, and several shells with a diameter of 155 millimeters landed in the bustling area of the capital and hit a building. The situation on the front lines near the capital was very quiet. Only in the area of the Harama River in the southeast, the government army artillery bombarded the National Army positions in the city of Maranosa for four hours. Both sides seem to be waiting for an opportunity to prepare for a renewed offensive (27th, Havas News).

⊙Avila: Today, a thousand members of the government army's militia set out, intending to take the strategy of flanking to capture the Robberton De Chiav station, nine miles south of Escorial. Unexpectedly, they suddenly encountered 200 members of the National Army. The National Army strafed with machine guns from the top of the mountain, causing the militia to die in large numbers. The wounded were all captured, and none survived (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters).

### Results of Indian Provincial Elections

National Congress Party Wins Big

⊙Bombay: The final results of the provincial elections under the new Indian constitution show that the National Congress Party has an absolute majority in the administrative regions of Bombay and Madras, the United Provinces and the Central Provinces, Bihar, and Orissa. In Bengal, Assam, and the Northwest Frontier Province, the National Congress Party is the largest single party, while in Punjab and Sindh, the parties that support the constitution have won a majority. The National Congress Party's victory in Madras is the most remarkable, because the Justice Party has long dominated there for the past 14 years, but in this election, the Justice Party was defeated miserably, winning only 16 seats, while the National Congress Party won 159 seats and occupied 26 of the 46 seats in the upper house. However, whether the National Congress Party members will take office depends on Gandhi's will, and the final decision will be made at the All India National Congress Party Congress in Delhi in mid-March. The current official goal of the National Congress Party is the destruction of the constitution (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters).

### Song Zheyuan's Spring Banquet in Tianjin

Qin Dechun Talks About His Impressions of the Third Plenary Session Chen Juesheng Talks About His Views on North China's Diplomacy

Tianjin Communication: Song Zheyuan originally planned to leave Tianjin and return to Beiping after the Lantern Festival, but he postponed his departure to wait for Qin Dechun to return to Tianjin and report on the Third Plenary Session. Taking advantage of his stay in Tianjin and because there are no special issues in North China's diplomatic and political situation recently, he decided to invite guests in Tianjin on March 2nd and 3rd. All celebrities in Tianjin, important figures in the field, key personnel related to Hebei and Chahar, and foreign guests are on the list of invitations, and invitation cards have been issued. The reception locations are divided into two places, one is at 89 Jingsheng Society, 19th Road, British Concession (the society was purchased from the descendants of President Li Da at a price of 170,000 yuan, originally the Li family's Tianjin residence), and the other is at the Cao Residence Garden on Huangwei Road, Hebei. In addition to drinking and having fun, famous actors Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, Hou Xirui, and Li Hongchun are invited to perform. The play list is personally arranged by Song. Li will perform "The Ancient City Meeting," Shang will perform "Nineteen Knights of Qingcheng," and Cheng will perform "The Story of Red Whiskers," all of which imply encouragement and self-improvement. The dinner will be prepared by chefs from Dongxinglou, Fengzeyuan, and Xilaishun restaurants in Beiping. From March 1st to 3rd, special trains will be added between Beiping and Tianjin on the Beining Road to welcome and send guests. Song will leave Tianjin and return to Beiping two days after the banquet. From February 27th, key personnel from Hebei and Chahar and the 29th Army came to Tianjin from Beiping to attend the grand event, causing general hotels to be fully booked.

Qin Dechun returned to Tianjin from Beijing at 7:40 pm on the 27th. After getting off the train at the new station, he went straight to Song's residence on Qiangzi Road in the British Concession to meet Song and report on his attendance at the Third Plenary Session. Zhang Zizhong, Feng Zhian, Liu Ruming, Guo Zhihan, Yang Zhaogeng, Wang Shijiu, and others all gathered at Song's residence to listen to the situation. Qin is now accompanying Song in Tianjin to entertain guests and will not return to Beiping to handle government affairs until three days later. According to Qin, the process of going south is roughly as follows: "I had an excellent impression of attending the Third Plenary Session this time. Most of the conference proposals focused on internal issues of anti-communism and external issues of diplomacy. Regarding anti-communism, as the declaration shows, its spirit is also very applicable in North China. The wording of the declaration has been revised several times before it was published, and all the words have been carefully considered and deliberated. Its prudence and solemnity can be imagined. Regarding diplomatic issues, the central government's decision is also as stated in the declaration. From now on, the whole country will work together to achieve it in the principle of sincere unity. The conference did not make a separate proposal for North China. While in Beijing, I met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek three times and the ministers of various central ministries several times to explain in detail the situation in North China maintained by Chairman Song over the past year. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the ministers of various ministries have fully understood the situation in Hebei and Chahar. Before leaving Beijing, I met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once again, and he was very comforting. I did not stop when I passed through Shandong. Shandong Province sent Zhang Tie to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session, and he will also return to Shandong to report in the next few days."

Li Sihao came to Tianjin from Beiping on the 27th, possibly to visit Ikeda and Jugo Koshikawa, president of the Japan Xingzhong Company, to discuss the revitalization of the Longyan Mine. Chen Juesheng told people on the 27th, "North China's diplomacy in the past year has been handled with compromise based on the principles of preserving territorial sovereignty and stabilizing people's hearts. Although there have been three or two minor twists and turns, the results have all been resolved satisfactorily based on these principles. At present, local people's hearts and social prosperity have increased compared with the past. This year, the authorities will still bear the responsibility based on this principle, and in addition, they will use their remaining strength to seek the development of economic construction. After the Japanese government changed its prime minister, the new cabinet's policy has changed slightly, and it may no longer have the idea of ​​invading North China. If there is no external force to obstruct it, North China's situation this year will definitely be better than last year (28th)."

### Hunan Blocking Dongting Lake Dispute Expands

Entire Hubei Public is Planning Resistance, Jianli Chewan River Embankment Suddenly Collapses

Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the case of Hunan Province building dikes and weirs in Dongting Lake, blocking four mouths of the Yangtze River, the people of various counties along the river in Hubei Province previously rose up in resistance, followed by the provincial party headquarters and the two chambers of commerce in Wuhan opposing it, thus the issue expanded. President Jiang of the Executive Yuan also attached great importance to this matter and has handed it over to the National Economic Council for investigation and handling. Currently, the people of Jiangling, Jianli, Tianmen, Mianyang and other counties along the river have elected Xie Shengkan, Chuan Xiangrong, Shen Zhaonian, Zhang Nanxian and others as representatives, initiating a joint meeting of representatives of fellow villagers associations in Wuhan from various counties, scheduled for March 7th, to discuss countermeasures. On February 27th, a notice was issued with impassioned language, the original text saying: "Hubei has always been known as a land of lakes, with the Yangtze River running through it. The fate of more than twenty counties along the banks rests on the dikes. Since the old courses of the nine holes and thirteen mouths cannot be fully restored, we can only rely on the existing Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi and Tiaoxian four mouths to divert water into Dongting Lake, slightly reducing the force of the surging waves. In recent years, various places have arbitrarily blocked and built tributaries, competing with the water for land, leading to the horizontal encroachment and blocking of the above-mentioned four mouths repeatedly. Disasters of this kind are still common. It is said that Hunan is raising 50,000 yuan to prepare for construction, and a review of a certain water conservancy publication containing Li Yizhi's suggestions for managing Dongting Lake also states that the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission intends to build rolling dams at the Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, and Tiaoxian four mouths. If this becomes a reality, it would not only greatly violate Chairman Jiang's directive to return farmland to lakes, but also cause floods to inundate the dikes along the Yangtze River in Hubei, leading to an irreparable collapse. We will soon see the Yangtze River changing its course, Dongting Lake moving north, the confluence of the Jiang and Xiang rivers, and the people of Hubei buried in the waves. The stakes are so high that we cannot sit idly by. We have specially arranged to meet at the Jingnan Middle School in Wuchang on March 7th to discuss proper countermeasures. In addition to reporting to the Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Capital Police Bureau to send personnel for guidance, we plan to first convene fellow villagers residing in Wuhan from your county to discuss in advance, and elect representatives to attend the meeting at Jingnan Middle School on the scheduled date. This matter concerns the public interest of the entire province, so please do not delay.”

Amidst the particularly tense situation regarding the Hunan-Hubei water conservancy issue, the Chewan River Embankment in Jianli suddenly collapsed. This embankment blocks the mighty Yangtze River, serving as the only guarantee for Jianli, Mianyang, Hanchuan, Jiayu, and Hanyang counties, no less important than the Yaodi Embankment in Zhongxiang and the Wancheng Embankment in Jingzhou. Over the years, annual repairs have cost a huge amount of money, and the Yue Di Embankment was built in advance to prevent accidents. Unexpectedly, recently, the foundation of the Yongxing godown at the embankment was eroded by backflow, and the outer bank suddenly collapsed, endangering the fundamental main embankment. Upon receiving the report, the National Economic Council ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to rush to transport boulders and weave them into cages to throw into the collapsed area for protection. However, due to the changing river course, the Yongxing Wharf embankment section continued to collapse after re-evaluation. Within a month or so, more than thirty zhang collapsed, and the Qingguo Wharf was also affected, with a collapsing trend. The embankment body that is about to collapse now is approximately four li long, in a state of extreme danger. In addition to Jianghan Engineering Bureau Director Xi Dejiong, National Economic Council Technical Specialist Wang Huzhen, Chief Engineer Shi Dupei, and others going to devise ways to rush to protect the embankment, various institutions and legal entities in Jianli are also uniting with people from the seven counties whose survival depends on this embankment to appeal to the central and Hubei governments and the water conservancy authorities to allocate three-tenths of the funds for protecting the Yaodi Embankment to quickly deal with the danger, in order to protect the lives and property of the people of the seven counties. It is said that at this time, the river water is unusually dry, but the major main embankment of the Yangtze River is in danger. The reason for the failure is that the maintenance of the embankment body was not solid, and the project was neglected and shoddy, not related to the immersion and erosion of the water. If work is not started quickly and it is still treated as a child's play, then as soon as the spring water rises, the seven counties of Jianli and Mianyang will immediately become a major disaster, without waiting for the great flood in midsummer.

### Summary of the Sino-British Joint Survey of the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border

—Location is Laochang, in the Interior of Yunnan Province—

Lancang Correspondence: The Sino-British Joint Survey Committee of the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border held a meeting on January 2nd in Laochang. The Chinese members were Liang Yugao and Zhang Zuyin, and the British members were Graesser and Towerz. The details are as follows:

Upper Border Itinerary

The Chinese members of the Sino-British Joint Survey of the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border departed from Kunming on November 29th of last year, passed through Chuxiong, and arrived in Dali on the 30th, where they prepared packhorses and other matters. Liu Maoqing, the brigade commander of the local defense army, and Shi Minzhai, the pacification director, entertained everything after the arrival of the two members, Liang and Zhang, and led them to visit their barracks and other places. Brigade Commander Liu has been stationed in the area for many years and pays attention to construction projects. Sheng Lu Park and the barracks are among his military and industrial construction projects. The park faces Erhai Lake, with the morning glow and evening shadows in full view, and is backed by Cangshan Mountain, with snow accumulating year after year. The brigade's barracks do not borrow from civilian residences, but are built purely by military workers, neat and orderly, with fixed places for officers and soldiers to live, which can be called a model army on the border. On December 3rd, the upper border transportation was ready, and the entire group departed from Xiaguan. They stayed in Taicang that day, and arrived in Menghua on the 4th. This place was formerly a subprefecture and is now a county seat. The city walls are simple and ancient, and the streets are wide, making it a major town in the border area. On the 5th, they arrived in Luoqiu. The terrain here gradually rises, already 6,000 feet above sea level. The mountain paths along the way are extremely rugged and can hardly be called roads. People and horses staggered down through the gravel in the mountain streams. On the 6th, they arrived in Gonglang. The mountain road is also extremely rugged, with gravel slabs covering the road, mixed with dust, which is easy to float. The horseshoes slid down diagonally and could not stand still. The terrain on the border of the Yunnan and Burma is all "undulating land." Every day's itinerary includes uphill and downhill slopes, with ups and downs of thirty to forty li. Those who come for the first time find it bitter to climb, and bitter to descend, but after a while, they become accustomed to it. On the 7th, they went from Gonglang to Shaojie. On the way, they passed the Shenzhou Ferry. The Han Prime Minister's so-called "crossing the Lu River with an isolated army in May" refers to crossing this water. The water rises rapidly in the hot months, making it truly difficult to cross the Lu River in May. The river flows a little slower in winter, but the terrain at the river crossing point is precipitous, and people and horses are crowded, with no room to stay. After crossing the river, they climbed a steep cliff. The road is sloping and steep, and at its most dangerous, it is angled from sixty to seventy degrees. Looking down at the riverbank, there is no ground below. With the slightest carelessness, one could be crushed to pieces. It can be said that there is absolutely no plain land here. In addition to opening up mountain fields, few paddy fields are seen. On the 8th, they went from Shaojie to Maolan. There are hot springs in this place. From here onwards, hot springs are frequently seen, and the smell of sulfur is very strong. It is expected that there are many sulfur mines along this area. On the 9th, they arrived in Yun County. The terrain gradually becomes flat, and the fields become fertile. Malignant malaria is prevalent in this county. It is said that two to three thousand people have died from the epidemic in the hot months. Those in charge of sanitation and health should pay attention to this. The epidemic began to slow down slightly in winter. On the 10th, they arrived at Toudaoshui. The residents are extremely poor. They struggle to make a living, and their clothes do not cover their bodies. Even in the dead of winter, they wear single clothes and have no bedding. They rely on sunlight during the day and light fires at night to keep warm. On the 11th, they arrived at Ant Hill. The houses are simple, with few tile houses besides thatched huts. On the 12th, they arrived at Mianning City. This is the only city on the border. After passing this, they entered the territory of Lancang County. Lancang County has moved its seat several times, and the location of the subprefecture seat has no city walls to this day, only a county office. On the 30th, the entire office of the Chinese members arrived at Laochang, the meeting place for both parties, setting up tents and camps, and preparing everything.

Personnel of Both Sides

The chairman of the current neutral committee is still Colonel Isselin. Mr. Bret is Isselin's accompanying secretary. Both were specially appointed by the League of Nations and are of Swiss nationality. Liang Yu, the Chinese member, replaced Mr. Klerger, the chief member of the previous session, who resigned due to illness. Graesser, a member of the previous session, was promoted to chief member, and Towerz, the consul with the title of consul general, who is currently the consul in Tengchong, was assigned as a member. Towerz served as the consul in Tengchong for many years. During last year's border survey, he served as a consultant to the British side. He can speak fluent Chinese, can read and write Chinese characters, and is quite familiar with the Chinese situation.

Meeting Location

The Chinese side originally proposed Bangsang as the meeting location, the reason being that the weather is suitable for work in the winter months, but it was not completely decided at that time. The British side proposed the second point of longitude and latitude on the treaty (i.e., what is commonly known as Point B) as the meeting location, on the grounds that the survey work began at the second point of longitude and latitude on the treaty, (that is, what is commonly called point B), and that the itinerary of the surveyors and the committee was consistent, which would be convenient for the protection of the army. Subsequently, the neutral chairman decided that the meeting location would be Laochang, because the previous session closed in Laochang, and this session should continue the work of the previous session, and there is nothing better than meeting at the place where the previous session closed.

Camps of Both Sides

Laochang is famous for producing silver and lead. Even now, lead tiles from the Ming Dynasty can still be excavated from the ground. During its heyday, there were many lead factories, with residents numbering five to six thousand. Later, the Lahu people rebelled, carrying out massacres, and the residents scattered, so its industry declined. Today, only broken walls and ruins remain, as well as one or two lead factories mined by indigenous methods. The Chinese camp was set up on a large lawn next to the lead factory. The four mountains surround it, and the temperature varies greatly from morning to afternoon (from 30 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit). After some initial tidying up, tents were set up, lined up in rows, orderly and well-arranged. The gate of the camp was decorated with the flags of the party and the country, and the guards stood upright, solemnly guarding it. At night, the watch drums were stern, and the staff worked until late at night, creating an atmosphere of ten thousand tents without disputes. The British camp was located in Mipawei, fifteen li away from the Chinese camp. The British camp was laid out against the mountainside, making it very convenient for security. The troops brought by the British side consisted of three parts: British soldiers, Indian soldiers, and Burmese soldiers.

Beginning of Meeting

Before the event, after the British members arrived on December 29th, they began to communicate with the local area by letter. The Chinese members believed that Laochang was a local place in their own country, and they should first pay a visit to the British side. After notifying them by letter, on the morning of the 31st, the two members, Liang and Zhang, along with Secretary Director Tang Chengyou and secretaries Xu Yunchen and four other staff members, as well as the head of the guard team, went to the British camp for a meeting. As soon as they arrived at the gate of the camp, the British army raised the Chinese national flag amidst the sound of bugles, and the entire venue stood in silence to pay their respects. Thus, the flags of both sides (the British flag on the left and the Chinese flag on the right) fluttered in the solemn atmosphere. At about 11 o'clock, the neutral chairman, Mr. Isselin, arrived with his secretary, and they first paid a visit to the neutral chairman. At 12 o'clock, the British side hosted a banquet, with members, secretaries, directors, guard team officers, and others attending as guests. During the banquet, the neutral chairman stood up and gave a speech, briefly saying that Mr. Warless, the British member of the previous session, has been promoted to chief member this time, which is worthy of congratulations. He expressed his respect to Mr. Liang, the Chinese member, for resuming his position as chief member, and congratulated Mr. Towerz of the British side and Mr. Zhang Zuyin of the Chinese side for their appointment as members. He then mentioned that Mr. Klerger, the chief member of the British side in the previous session, and Mr. Yin, the Chinese member of the previous session, could not attend due to illness and personal matters, which he regretted. He went on to say that the border survey work is indeed a difficult task. We have encountered many difficulties in the previous session, and the difficulties this time may be even greater than those in the previous session, but I hope that both sides will maintain the spirit of cooperation and complete the mission we are entrusted with. Then, he raised his glass to wish good health to the members of both sides and all those present. The members of both sides then gave speeches, expressing their respect to the neutral chairman, Mr. Isselin, and expressing their regret that the former members Klerger and Yin could not participate this time. At about 2 o'clock, the Chinese members said goodbye and left. (To be continued)

### Suzhou

Request to Abolish Business Tax

The County Chamber of Commerce, based on the recommendations of the Iron Machine Silk Weaving, Yarn Satin, and other trade associations, believes that the business tax, which is now being levied by the Ministry of Finance, conflicts with the nature of the income tax and is almost a double tax. It should be abolished to avoid double taxation on one item. Furthermore, at a time when commerce is in extreme decline, the government is also sympathetic to reducing burdens and eliminating excessive regulations. The Chamber of Commerce should advocate this together with Shanghai and other ports. Based on this, the Chamber of Commerce of Jiangsu Province has scheduled a joint meeting for March 1st. Therefore, the original proposal was submitted for discussion. It was unanimously agreed to submit another report to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a clear order to abolish the business tax. As for the income tax regulations, the first category, subcategory A, which starts taxation for capital above 2,000 yuan, should be changed to start taxation for capital above 5,000 yuan to relieve small businesses and merchants. This was also submitted to the Provincial Chamber of Commerce for discussion and advocacy.

### Wuxi

Emergency Prevention of Meningitis

Tan Shouren, the preparatory director of the local health office, due to the recent discovery of meningitis in various parts of the city and countryside, with successive deaths of residents, convened an epidemic prevention meeting yesterday in order to prevent the disease. It was resolved: 1. As a defensive step, a general mobilization will be launched to administer vaccinations. 2. Nurses and health teams will be dispatched to the Xindu Bridge and other areas in the Fourth District to suppress the disease. 3. The First Department will be responsible for intelligence, and health police will be responsible for investigative work. 4. A defense team will be organized. 5. The vaccination time will be set. 6. Prevention expenses will be temporarily paid from the funds of this office. If the disease spreads and many medicines are used, a request for appropriation will be submitted. On the 28th, more than 100 residents went to the office to receive vaccinations. Also, Sun Lindi, a girl from No. 17 Qinfu Lane, Zhoushan, who was seriously ill with meningitis, is no longer in danger after being injected with serum.

### Expansion of Woolen Cloth Factory

The Xiexin Woolen Cloth Factory in Wuyabing, outside the North Gate of this city, was founded by Tang Xiangting of this city in the previous year. Due to the excellent quality of its products and the prosperous business, the factory added a wool combing machine worth over 10,000 yuan last year. At the end of the past year, it ended with a great profit. The factory has now started work again and intends to expand this year. The Gengyu Cloth Factory outside the West Gate originally had 280 looms. Last year's profit was more than 440,000, so it also needs to add four looms this year to expand its scope.

### Jiangyin

Approved Exemption from Fishing Tax

The fishing tax of this county is 7 taels, 9 qian, 7 fen, and 6 li of silver per year. It has always been paid by fishermen along the Yangtze River. The county government believes that this fishing tax is very small and similar to excessive miscellaneous taxes. In order to reduce the burden on fishermen and develop the fishing industry, it specially submitted a justification and reported to the province for approval to stop collecting it.

### Dredging the City River, Assisting with Donations According to Grade

The Construction Committee decided to hold a meeting on the 27th to dredge the city river. Residents in the city will donate according to four grades: Special Grade: Donate according to ability; Grade A: 1 yuan per person; Grade B: 5 jiao per person; Grade C: 2 jiao per person.

Rain and Snow Affect Traffic

Since February 11th, heavy snow has fallen in various parts of Jiangbei, accumulating more than a foot deep, followed by heavy rain, which has not stopped for several days. In addition to the accumulation of several feet of water in the new canal of the guiding Huai River into the sea, which washed away the two earth dikes of the Xiba Wangying, all the motor vehicle highways in the Jiangbei area, such as the Qing (jiang) Yang (zhou), Qing Su (qian), Su (ning), and Qing Shu (yang) lines, were damaged by rain and snow, making it inconvenient for vehicles to travel. Sometimes they get stuck in the mud and it is difficult to pull them out. Therefore, it is difficult to sell tickets for all the lines for a while, which has greatly affected traffic.

### The Field Was Wet and Difficult to Handle, Pinghan Lost to Loreal Yesterday

Lost Two Goals in the First Half, Lost Four More in the Second Half, Cao Qiuting Scored a Goal, Finally Becoming Six to One, The Group is Scheduled to Leave Shanghai at 8:00 AM This Morning and Return to Wuhan

The Pinghan Railway Football Team toured Pingjin during the Lunar New Year and was invincible. This time, it came south with honor and arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. It planned to challenge the strong Chinese and Western teams in this city, such as Donghua and Fashang. Unexpectedly, at the time of its arrival in Shanghai, the inter-port team had just returned from a long trip, and it was difficult to fight due to the hard journey, so both were politely rejected. Finally, through the mediation of Zhou Jiaqi of the Progressive Association, it was agreed to play against the British army Loreal. The game took place yesterday in Shenyuan, but due to the rain, the football field was saturated with water and was slippery. Only 40% of the seats were sold. Every player on both sides fell like a clay figure of Wuxi, the ball was heavy and wet, and it was difficult to exert footwork, so the game was less exciting. As a result, Pinghan suffered a disastrous defeat of six to one. The whole team is scheduled to take the early express train north at 8:00 am this morning, transfer to the Longhai Road and return to Wuhan. The battle situation yesterday is as follows:

Pinghan Kicks Off

First attack, Yan Chengkuan passed the ball forward, Xu Wenkui lifted his foot and shot, but it was a foot off the mark and missed. The British army advanced from the left, and Shabers shot, and it fell from the upper left corner, extremely tricky. Fortunately, Yan Tanghua lightly supported it into a corner kick. At ten minutes, Tefei made a lob shot on the penalty line, and it cut through the crossbar and bounced in. Yan jumped up to block it, and it leaked from his fingertips. The British army

Opened the Score First

Before long, the Pinghan team encountered danger again. When Yan Woluek pushed Tule to shoot from a distance, he couldn't jump up because the ground was slippery, so he was heavily surrounded. Fortunately, he was agile and didn't lose the ball. Then, Chen Zhenxiang took a free kick from 25 yards in front of the enemy's goal, but it was ineffective. Tule crossed, Guan Jiyang lost his footing, and Yan also slipped and fell to the ground. Ottol was just waiting next to him, and he scored the ball into the net. The British army had already

Scored Two Goals in a Row within Thirteen Minutes

After that, Xu Wenkui, Cao Qiuting, and Zhang Jinhai had good opportunities, but they all lost the opportunity because of the difficulty in exerting their footwork. The British army's offensive was extremely strong. Yan Tanghua's business was booming, and his fists and hands waved in all directions, saving many dangerous balls. At the end of the first half, Pinghan was behind by two to zero.

After the Lemon

Pinghan Zhang Dejiang and Cao Qiuting advanced sharply along the left side together, and Yazi failed to stop them. Zhang crossed, and the position was excellent. Mike rushed out to rescue, forming an empty goal, but unfortunately, Cao stepped on the muddy ground and slipped and fell, so Mike

Pinghan Football Team

Easily picked it up. After a stalemate of ten minutes, Shabers shot from the right corner, and Yan was caught in the mud and couldn't save it. He watched the ball bounce in from the right post, making it three to zero. After the center line kicked off, Shabers made another tricky shot, brushing the post. After that, Pinghan changed Cao Qiuting to the right wing, and switched positions with Zhang Dejiang, and there were many opportunities for advancement, but none of them were successful. Soon, Clayton of the British army scored another goal,

Making it Four to Zero

At this time, the British army attacked with all its strength, and the two defenders also crossed the center line. Yan Tanghua's business was booming for a while. At 35 minutes, Cao Qiuting suddenly gained momentum and advanced sharply alone. He shot with force on the penalty line and went in under Mike's armpit. Pinghan finally managed to pull back a goal. Unfortunately, as soon as the joy was over, Tule dribbled past Yin Guan and lightly lobbed it into the net. Soon, Clayton scored another goal in the crowd. Although Pinghan also had two opportunities under the goal, Zhang Dejiang was slightly slower, and Cao Qiuting's footwork was weak, so they lost six to one. The lineup of the Pinghan team is as follows:

Wu Guicheng Zhang Dejiang Guan Jiyang Cao Qiuting Yan Tanghua Chen Zhenxiang Xu Wenkui Yin Zhengda Zhang Jinhai Zhao Qichun Yan Chengkuan

### Hong Kong Ordinary Cup

South China's Hope is Also High

(Hong Kong, 28th) On the 28th, in the Ordinary Cup, the Chinese team played against the Navy. Because the Navy mostly used newcomers, their combat effectiveness was not strong. In the first half, Li Deqi of the Chinese team scored two goals first, but they were invalidated due to being offside. Guo Yingqi then scored a goal, opening the score. In the second half, Li Deqi scored a goal with his head. As a result, the Chinese team won three to zero. In South China played against St. Joseph, and the South team's strong players Lin Depu and Zhuo Shijin were absent and replaced by B team members. Their lineup was not complete, and they tried their best to fight. In the first half, neither side scored. In the second half, both sides won a goal and drew, which was fortunate. In South China played against Jiuhua Club, and Hui Tang was not present and was replaced by Feng Jingxiang as the center forward. The strength was weaker. In the first half, Huang Meishun kicked in a free kick. In the second half, Feng kicked in a corner kick. As a result, South China won two to zero, and the hope of winning the championship increased.

### Dai Linjing Single-Handedly Leads Donghua to a 4-2 Victory Over Western Police

Losing by Two Goals in the First Half, Turning Defeat into Victory in the Second Half

This week's Group A matches, originally scheduled for four venues, were disrupted by rain on Saturday. Yesterday's match between Western Merchants and Shaqier was also postponed due to the wet racetrack. Therefore, only the match between Donghua and Western Police proceeded as scheduled at the Municipal Sports Field. As a result, Donghua was at a disadvantage in the first half due to the headwind, losing by two goals. In the second half, they doubled their efforts, with Dai Linjing single-handedly scoring four goals, reversing the situation to win 4-2. Yesterday's morning league match between Jinde and Jews was also postponed due to the closure of Hongkou Park. A brief account of the Donghua vs. Western Police match is as follows:

At the sound of the whistle, Donghua attacked first against the wind. Sun Jinshun was absent due to unforeseen circumstances. About five minutes into the match, Douglas, the center forward of Western Police, advanced with the wind and scored a low shot, catching Zhang Rongcai off guard, and Western Police opened the scoring. Donghua buried their heads in effort, but due to the slippery ground, they struggled to maintain possession, missing opportunities. Before they could recover, Douglas launched another attack, taking advantage of the chaos in front of the goal to score a header. Within fifteen minutes, Western Police had won two goals in a row with an arrogant attitude. Donghua strictly directed its members, striving to advance. The situation indeed changed, and good opportunities arose repeatedly. However, due to the headwind, they repeatedly missed opportunities. The first half ended with a 0-2 deficit.

After the lemon break, Donghua calmly responded. Just six minutes into the second half, Dai Linjing received a brilliant pass from Qian Jingyong and scored, pulling back a goal. Five minutes later, they got a penalty opportunity. Dai executed it again, tying the score at 2-2 in an instant. Donghua's momentum grew stronger, and their attack intensified. In the nineteenth minute, as Mei Enzheng held the ball, Donghua formed an encirclement. However, Turner kicked someone, resulting in another penalty kick. Dai Linjing calmly completed the task, making it 3-1, and Donghua took the lead from then on. Although Western Police tried their best to counterattack, the situation was ultimately controlled by Donghua. Finally, in the last three or four minutes before the end of the match, Dai Linjing used his left foot to shoot a low shot into the left corner under the goal, scoring again and reversing the victory with a score of 4-2.

### The Industrial and Commercial Football Final Between Jinde and Changgeng Ended Disagreeably

Spectators Rushed onto the Field, Causing Disorder; The Committee Will Resolve the Outcome

The eighth Industrial and Commercial Football Competition at the Municipal No. 1 Sports Field saw the final between the Jinde and Changgeng teams of the "Shen" group. Having previously tied in the championship match, they rescheduled for a rematch, which was postponed twice due to rain. It was not until 10:00 AM yesterday that the final was played again. Citizens were impressed by the past performances of the two teams, and more than 3,000 people went to watch. At the beginning of the match, the forces were very even, and there was no progress. Later, Jinde's front line took the opportunity to advance, and right inside forward Huang Zhenhe shot in a goal. Not long after the start of the second half, Changgeng's right winger Yang Wenhui also scored a goal, resulting in a tie. Afterwards, Jinde's offensive was quite fierce, but Changgeng's defense was very strong, and Jinde's forwards ultimately failed to succeed. When time ran out without a winner, the match was extended by twenty minutes according to the rules. In the first ten minutes, neither side showed superiority, but Jinde's right winger Huang Zhenhe (who changed positions at the start of the second half) and Changgeng's left halfback Jin Jiabiao fell to the ground together while fighting for the ball. At that time, a Jinde player was penalized for being offside, and the ball had already been kicked out by the Changgeng team. In the process, Huang Zhenhe, who was lying on the ground, touched Jin Jiabiao's face with his foot. The two sides almost broke out in anger, but it was quickly resolved. In the last ten minutes, the teams switched sides and fought again. Due to the excessive number of spectators, people gradually squeezed into the bamboo fence, and the order was not as good as before. Less than two minutes into the match, Jinde's left forward Wang Yishan stepped on the foot of Changgeng's right forward Hu Hanwen. The referee immediately blew the whistle to penalize Wang Yishan, but Hu Hanwen kicked Wang Yishan. At that time, a spectator rushed onto the field and chased after Wang Yishan. The crowd also rushed onto the field, with some shouting to hit and others trying to dissuade. The entire field was in chaos, and the match could not continue. It is said that the referee will report the facts to the committee, which will resolve the matter at a meeting.

### Shanghai Post Office to Collect Income Tax

Interest on Deposits and Loans Allowed to Offset for Calculation

The collection of Shanghai's income tax was originally handled by the Shanghai Central Bank. In recent days, over a thousand people have been paying their taxes at the Central Bank daily, causing severe congestion. Moreover, Shanghai is vast, and taxpayers who live far from the Central Bank find the journey inconvenient. Therefore, the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance requested the Central Bank to consult with the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. It has been agreed that, from March 1st of this year, thirty designated post offices in Shanghai will also collect income tax. Taxpayers can now pay their taxes at the nearest post office, avoiding congestion and travel. As for credit accounts between banks, money houses, and firms, if an account (referring to a single passbook) has both deposits and loans, the deposit interest and loan interest should be allowed to offset each other when calculating interest. However, if they are not in the same account, offsetting is not allowed. The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department has already issued an interpretation to this effect and sent letters to the Bankers Association to inform all banks, money houses, and firms.

### Fishery Syndicate to be Established Today

First Board Meeting to be Convened

The Ministry of Industry's Fishery Syndicate is scheduled to be established today, and the first board meeting will be convened at 10:00 AM. The meeting will elect executive directors, managers, and assistant managers, and discuss business plans. Details are as follows:

Official and Merchant Directors

The syndicate's board of directors, as stipulated in the articles of association, consists of nineteen members: seven from the government and twelve from the commercial sector. The government has appointed Yu Zhenyong, Qian Xinzhi, Gui Yanfang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Yuanshan, and Zhang Yijun. The commercial sector will have one representative from each participating bank: Cheng Muhao from Bank of China, Zeng Jiru from Bank of Communications, Dong Chengdao from Bank of Shanghai, Xu Xingliu from Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhou Desun from Four Banks Joint Savings Society, Yang Peichang from Jin Cheng Bank, Wang Shaoxian from Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Chen Jianhan from China & South Sea Bank, Xu Maotang from China Joint Savings Bank, Ye Fuxiao from The Continental Bank, Wang Zhixin from The New China Bank, and Jin Shangqi from Ningpo Commercial & Savings Bank. There will be seven executive directors, with the government designating Xu Xingliu and Yu Zhenyong. The commercial executive directors will be mutually elected by the other directors. The Ministry of Industry has appointed Yan Shenyu as the supervising officer.

Meeting Agenda

Today's establishment will not involve a ceremony. Instead, the first board meeting will be held at 10:00 AM at the syndicate's office on the fourth floor of The New China Bank. Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang is unable to come to Shanghai, and has sent a telegram designating Vice Minister Zhou Yichun to represent him and provide guidance. The meeting agenda is as follows: A) Formalities; B) Opening remarks by the Chairman of the Board; C) Instructions from the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry; D) Report by the preparatory staff on the preparatory process; E) Discussion items: 1) Mutual election of five executive directors; 2) Confirmation of the candidates for manager and assistant manager; 3) Ratification of the regulations submitted by the preparatory office for filing; 4) Approval of the syndicate's budget; 5) Determination of the syndicate's business plan. It is reported that the contract will be passed in the meeting, and then the first year's contract between the syndicate and each bank will be signed.

Loan Disbursement to Begin

The syndicate has decided to begin disbursing loans before the spring fishing season. The application process will be kept as simple as possible. Detailed regulations will be included in the loan disbursement charter, which will be released after approval by the board of directors. The loan recipients will primarily be fishermen who are direct producers, avoiding lending through fish merchants. Cash payments and receipts will be implemented. However, if it is necessary to temporarily use fish merchants, flexible arrangements will still be made to gradually improve the system. The scope of the loans will initially focus on the investigated production areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and will then be gradually expanded to other areas.

Allocation of Funds

The syndicate's total capital is one million yuan, divided into fixed and circulating capital. The Ministry of Industry will contribute 200,000 yuan of fixed capital, which has been allocated to The New China Bank, China Joint Savings Bank and Four Banks Joint Savings Society for storage. The 800,000 yuan of circulating capital will be contributed by twelve banks: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Bank of Shanghai, China & South Sea Bank, The Continental Bank, Ningpo Commercial & Savings Bank, The New China Bank, China Joint Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Four Banks Joint Savings Society. Contracts will be signed with the syndicate, stipulating interest payment methods. These will be officially signed after approval by the board of directors. The method for each bank to contribute circulating capital will be based on an allocation system. For example, if the board of directors approves a loan of 100,000 yuan for a certain area, each participating bank will be notified to allocate funds proportionally based on their capital contribution. The funds contributed by each bank will not be pooled in one place to be allocated by the syndicate.

Investigation of Production Areas

The syndicate attaches great importance to investigating production areas. Design committee member Qu Junyuan and investigator Cao Erwei have visited Shengsi Islands, Zhoushan Archipelago, and Jinshanwei to investigate the economic conditions of fishermen. Detailed reports on production have been provided to the syndicate for reference. It has now been decided that after the syndicate is established, a research department will be established under the syndicate to continue investigating the coastal fisheries of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and other coastal provinces as a reference for loan disbursement.

### Real Estate Association Convened Executive and Supervisory Meeting Yesterday

Strenuously Opposing Road Building Beyond Boundaries, House Tax, and Water Price Increase

The New News Agency reports that the Shanghai Real Estate Association convened a joint meeting of executives and supervisors yesterday to discuss how to respond to members' strong opposition to the water price increase and the Municipal Council's forceful demand that property owners be responsible for paying house tax in areas beyond the settlement boundaries. Details are as follows:

House Tax

The Real Estate Association received a joint letter from members of the Mainland Bank Trust Department, the China Industrial Bank Leasing Department, the Ken Yieh Bank Real Estate Department, the Zhongyi Trust Co., Ltd. Trust Department, the Youcheng Leasing Account Office, and the Hekun Company, stating: "We hereby inform you that, with regard to the properties in the areas beyond the settlement boundaries, many tenants have not paid the house tax, and the Municipal Council is forcefully demanding that the property owners be responsible for payment, threatening to block the drainage ditches and cesspools. We have investigated whether this district's house tax should be paid to the Shanghai Municipal Government or the Concession authorities. This matter concerns police power, and property owners and tenants are in a difficult position. Moreover, if property owners are forced to be responsible for recognizing the tax, this will increase their losses. Considering the principles of law and human nature, and in light of the current decline in the real estate industry, property owners should not bear undue responsibility and losses. Members have limited properties in areas beyond the settlement boundaries, and it is difficult to deal with this situation alone. Therefore, we request that your association convene an urgent meeting as soon as possible to request instructions from the Shanghai Municipal Government and to find ways to negotiate with the Concession authorities. We also hope that you will request the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to uphold justice. We hope for the best."

Water Price

The Association convened a joint meeting of executives and supervisors at its meeting hall on Shanxi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Shen Tianxin, Shen Lianfang, Zhou Weishi, Xu Xiajun, Shen Jixuan, Li Bohan, and Wu Shutian. Shen Tianhua presided, and Shi Cizhou recorded the minutes. After formalities and an opening speech by the chairman, the following proposals were discussed: 1) The British Shanghai Waterworks Company announced that, starting this month, the water price discount will be changed from 25% to 20%. Members have sent letters expressing their opposition, requesting the Association to conduct earnest negotiations. How should this be handled? (Resolution) Send a letter to the British Concession Municipal Council to negotiate, to achieve the goal of cancellation. 2) Members of the Mainland Bank, Qian Yiru and others, sent a letter stating that, for properties in areas beyond the settlement boundaries, many tenants have not paid house tax, and the Municipal Council is forcefully demanding that property owners be responsible for payment. Should this district's house tax be paid to the Shanghai Municipal Government or the Municipal Council? Please negotiate with the authorities. (Resolution) Submit the situation to the Municipal Government and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, and request them to negotiate with the Municipal Council with reason. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.

### Yan Esheng Discusses Income Tax: All Businesses Should Expedite Filings

Deadline for Capital and Deposit Declarations Has Passed. Merchants and Citizens Should Support the Good Tax System and Act Quickly

The New Voice News Agency reports that, according to the Ministry of Finance's regulations, the deadline for income tax capital and deposit declarations is the end of February. However, many companies and businesses are still unclear about the filing procedures, and are inquiring with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Yan Esheng, secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, reported on the following:

Capital Declaration

The procedure for declaring capital is very simple. If the amount of capital has not changed since the business was established, it can be reported according to the original capital amount. If there has been a change, it can be reported according to the changed amount. Subsequent changes can still be reported at any time and are not subject to any restrictions. As for merchants requesting that public reserves be included in the capital calculation, this is currently under consideration by the Income Tax Office. It is generally expected to be adopted, but it is not necessary to include public reserves in the current declaration. Declaring capital is one issue, and including public reserves in the capital calculation in the future is another issue. Since there is no public reserve item on the capital declaration form, public reserves can be temporarily omitted.

Deposit Declaration

Deposit declaration is a preparation for the collection of income tax on deposit interest and has no other purpose. Previously, various trade associations suspected that other problems would arise after reporting, because the Ministry of Finance had issued an order to crack down on stores with insufficient deposit funds. This was a misunderstanding. The Ministry of Finance is cracking down on stores that set up deposit departments under that name to absorb cash and solicit savings deposits publicly. Store deposits are nothing more than deposits from the store owner's partners and relatives, which are neither savings deposits nor publicly solicited, and are therefore not within the scope of the crackdown. Moreover, the current deposit declaration form only lists three items: deposit type, number of accounts, and total deposit amount. Since there is no need to fill in and report each account individually, there should be no concerns. As for income from deposit interest, the banking industry deducts a 1/1000 handling fee, so only 4/1000 is actually paid (according to regulations, it should be 5/1000). Store deposits can be handled in the same way in the future. The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Office's Notice No. 4 also mentions deducting income tax according to the general method for the banking industry. The Chamber of Commerce has sent another letter to the office to seek further clarification in order to be more explicit.

Explanation of Penalties

Declaring capital and declaring deposits are obligations that citizens and merchants should fulfill to support the government's implementation of a good tax system. Therefore, even though the deadline has passed, it must still be expedited. There should be leeway for delays of a few days due to procedural reasons. However, merchants who suspect that they will be subject to a fine of up to 20 yuan under Article 18 of the Provisional Regulations are also mistaken. The penalty under Article 18 refers to reporting the amount of income as stipulated in the regulations, and does not refer to reporting the amount of capital as stipulated in the implementing rules, let alone reporting deposits, which is not stipulated in either the regulations or the implementing rules. However, even though the penalty does not apply, merchants and citizens should still enthusiastically declare. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also distributes these declaration forms and can be requested. If there are any doubts, you can inquire or refer to the Chamber of Commerce's Explanation of Income Tax Regulations.

The smallest increase was in 1934, with only 1,657 people. If many Chinese residents had not suddenly moved away last year, the average population would have exceeded 500,000 people.

Visited Suzhou Yesterday Morning to View the Wu Chinese Literature Exhibition

Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Suzhou from Nanjing yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he went to the Canglang Pavilion to view the Wu Chinese Literature Exhibition. He stayed there for a long time before leaving.

### Second Special District Citizens' Joint Association Notice

Establishment of Income Tax Declaration Agency

The Second Special District Citizens' Joint Association of the French Concession has established an income tax declaration agency to facilitate income tax declarations for businesses within the district. Accountant He Yuanming has been invited to provide guidance and handle income tax declaration procedures entrusted by various businesses. The notice is as follows: "Our country's income tax has been implemented since January 1st of this year.

The declaration date has been announced as February 28th of this year. The procedures are quite complicated, and there are many penalties. At the beginning of the implementation of this income tax, the general public may not be familiar with the calculation methods and declaration procedures. If there is any negligence, the losses will be great. This association has set up an income tax declaration agency at 434 Avenue Dubail and invited accountant He Yuanming to provide guidance to facilitate the companies and businesses.

At that time, the audience fled in panic, and the order was greatly disrupted, almost causing a major disaster. This action is a disruption of public order, and the Shanghai Grand Theater is located in a section of road built beyond the settlement boundaries, within the scope of our country's police power. Now this unfortunate incident has occurred, which is particularly distressing. The "Abyssinia" film has also been solemnly reviewed by our authorities. How can the sovereignty be disregarded and unwarranted interference be added? We hereby petition your association to forward the petition to the Municipal Government for immediate negotiations. We hope to achieve the goal of compensation and punishing the perpetrators, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, to protect sovereignty and maintain public security. We respectfully submit the petition."

### A Group of Children Does Not Know How to Divide Property

Crying Loudly in the Waiting Room, Laughing in the Courtroom

Qiao Zhiqing, a deceased local resident of No. 9, Yonghua Lane, Fushan Tang Street, Xiaonanmen, was engaged in the barge business and owned eight barges, accumulating considerable wealth. His first wife bore a daughter, who married a Xu and is known as Xu Qiao, aged 33, and a son named Qiao Chunsheng, aged 30. He remarried a Lu, who bore seven children, including Qiao Suzhen, aged 21, married to a Hu; Qiao Xiuzhen, aged 18; Qiao Fengzhen, aged 14; Qiao Huizhen, aged 13; Qiao Linsheng, aged 15; Qiao Fusheng, aged 10; and one younger child. Ms. Lu was able to transform into a kind stepmother, treating the children of the first wife better than her own, and the children of the first wife were grateful for her. Unfortunately, Qiao Zhiqing died of illness in July of the 23rd year, and Ms. Lu also passed away on December 19 of the 25th year. According to custom, the inheritance was managed by Qiao Chunsheng. However, Chunsheng, often bothered by his older sister Xu Qiao, filed a complaint with the local court requesting that the father's inheritance, valued at 11,580 yuan, be divided into nine shares, and stated that he was willing to waive the inheritance of his stepmother. The day before yesterday, Judge Wang opened the court. Before the court session began, the sisters and brothers were hugging each other in the waiting room, crying and scolding Qiao Chunsheng for being heartless. During the court hearing, Qiao Chunsheng stated that because the sisters and brothers were fighting for power after the parents' death, he would inevitably be accused of embezzlement in the future, so it was better to divide the property earlier. Xu Qiao and Hu Qiao Suzhen stated that they were already married and did not want to divide the property, and were willing to waive their share, but the younger siblings were young and Chunsheng was away from home and no one was taking care of them, so they were arguing with him. At this point, Qiao Linsheng, Qiao Fengzhen, Qiao Huizhen, and Qiao Fusheng were called to the stand. It was a group of children crying loudly in the waiting room, but after entering the courtroom, they were innocent and cheerful, laughing. The question officer could not help but cover his mouth and laugh. Judge Wang then said to Qiao Chun, "Your younger siblings are all children. You should designate a guardian for them so that they can be interrogated and judged." The case was postponed for two weeks.

### Disturbance in Longhua Town Over Demolition of Houses and Construction of Fences

Over a Hundred Men, Women, and Children Flock to the Police Station to Petition

In front of the temple grounds in Longhua Town, West Shanghai, the temple has over eighty city-owned houses, with monthly rent totaling over two hundred yuan, all collected by the monks. Later, Monk Yuanzhao mortgaged the house land to someone. After Yuanzhao left due to an incident, Lu Maotou and another nephew of the temple owner Lu Mingzhao took over the collection. However, recently, due to the sluggish market, business has been slow for various shops, and there have been rent arrears. Lu and others, unable to collect rent, secretly signed an agreement with the temple abbot, planning to demolish and rebuild the houses in order to increase rent and collect deposits. The afternoon before yesterday, Lu and others hired several bamboo craftsmen to build fences. The tenants learned of this and believed that with the annual incense season approaching, forcing them to relocate would be tantamount to sentencing hundreds of people to death. Therefore, they rose up in opposition, and in a short time, over a hundred men, women, and children gathered and flocked to the town police station, requesting that the police be sent to stop the construction. Luo, the chief of the Caojing Police Station, upon receiving the report, feared that an incident would occur and immediately ordered Officer Zhang to go and persuade the crowd to disperse. The tenants then elected representatives Yu Xiaochun and Xu Shiqin to request Officer Zhang to stop the construction first and to send elected representatives to petition the municipal government and other agencies for relief.

### Lake Society Schedules Talk on the Yongxin Shipwreck Tragedy

Petitioning the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Authorities to Suspend Yongshun Shipping Operations; Investigating Whether the Cause of the Accident Was Non-Compliance with Regulations

It is now scheduled to convene a meeting of the families of the victims at the Society on the afternoon of March 7, and letters have been sent to the Wuxing and Wujiang county governments and the Pingwang Public Security Bureau to send personnel to attend. The details are recorded as follows:

Investigation of the Cause Regarding the details of the disaster, various newspapers have already published reports. Now, the Society has received investigation reports from the Wujiang and Wuxing county governments and the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, which unanimously stated that the cause of the accident was indeed improper loading, careless navigation, and non-compliance with the regulations of the Maritime Affairs Bureau. The Maritime Affairs Bureau's investigation report stated that the Yongxin vessel departed from Huzhou at 7:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, having sold eighty-four tickets. The ship's awning and front and rear cabins were loaded with ten buckets of fresh ice, over ten loads of white rice, over nine hundred bolts of Huzhou silk, and over eighty pieces of luggage, resulting in excessive load and improper loading, with the upper part being heavy and the lower part light. It was determined that the ship's hull and machinery were not damaged beforehand, indicating that the accident was clearly due to a loss of balance.

Request for Strict Handling After the Lake Society published notices to collect information on the victims' families and the facts of the disaster, the families reported everything to the Society, especially regarding the company's responsible personnel who failed to provide immediate rescue after the accident, disregarding the lives of dozens of passengers and lacking conscience, expressing extreme anger and requesting the Society to uphold justice and provide assistance. After receiving the report, the Society submitted it to the 32nd regular meeting of the 13th session, deciding to first submit it to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that Yongshun's operations be ordered to cease and that the Xin Yong'an and Yongxin vessels be detained. According to a reply telegram from Chairman Zhu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, it was approved to send a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for investigation and strict handling.

Joint Negotiation

The Wujiang Native Place Association in Shanghai, regarding the Yongxin tragedy, felt that it was a matter of local concern and could not stand idly by. They sent a letter to the Lake Society Committee stating that the total loss and number of deaths after the sinking of the Yongxin ship was an unprecedented tragedy in the history of inland navigation. The association felt that it was a matter of local concern and could not stand idly by. A temporary standing committee meeting was convened, and a telegram was sent to the Wujiang County authorities to handle the matter carefully. The association planned to negotiate with the Yongshun Company jointly with your Society to comfort the departed souls. What should be done? Please advise.

Lake Society Notice The Lake Society issued a special notice yesterday, inviting the families of the victims to attend a discussion meeting. The notice stated, "We are writing to inform you that regarding the tragic accident of the Yongxin steamship, our Society has dispatched staff to conduct separate investigations. We have prepared and issued registration forms for the families to fill out and report the facts of the disaster. Documents have been prepared and submitted to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that the Yongshun Inland Steamship Company be ordered to cease operations and that the Xin Yong'an and Yongxin vessels be detained pending resolution of the case. In accordance with the requests of the families of the victims, who have sent letters requesting that justice be upheld, it is now scheduled to convene a discussion meeting with the families of the victims of the Yongxin disaster at our Society at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of March 7. We hope that you will attend on time, express your views, and discuss solutions. We eagerly anticipate your presence."

Pan's wife, Pan Zhang Peiqiong, 36 years old, was taking a bath in the pavilion room bathroom of her residence at 7:00 PM on the 17th of last month. Because the weather was cold, she ordered the maid to move a charcoal stove into the bathroom for heating. However, she fainted in the bathtub due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Around 8:00 PM, the maid, Hu Wu, noticed that the mistress had been in the bathroom for a long time without making a sound. She knocked on the door but received no response. She then opened the door and saw Pan Zhang Peiqiong lying unconscious in the bathtub, barely breathing. She was greatly alarmed. Because Mr. Pan was out, she called the doorman in the lane and reported it to the French Concession Police. Detectives were dispatched and she was taken to Guangci Hospital by car. However, because the poisoning was too severe, the rescue was ineffective. She died at 9:30 PM. The police transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch of the autopsy center to await an examination by officials from the Second Special Court today.

### Shanghai Ningbo Gentleman Li Jianhou Passes Away

Li Yan Yu (Jianhou), a Ningbo gentleman residing in Shanghai, was a former Qing Dynasty scholar. He served as the principal of Ningbo High School, Ningbo Middle School, and the Ningbo Association in Shanghai. His morality and writing were highly respected by the people of Ningbo for a long time. Last year, after resigning from his position as secretary of the China Industrial Bank, he rested at his residence in Shanghai. His wife, Zhang, passed away last month. Mr. Li was overly saddened and suddenly passed away at 10:00 PM on the 26th of last month. The funeral was held at 2:00 PM yesterday. Old friends in Shanghai, upon hearing the news, personally went to pay their respects, including Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Le Zhenbao, Gao Zhenxiao, Wu Yaqin, Xin Jiangming, Wang Simo, the President of the Second Special District Court, Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang, Criminal Court Presidents Liao Yan and Wang Yi, Civil Court President Wu Tingqi, Chief Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun of the First Special Court, Chief Prosecutor Zheng Yi of the Second High Court, as well as Yang Peng, Chen Ziguan, Li Hu, Fan Peien, and over 200 people from political and legal circles. They were all received by the staff of the association, Yin Jinzhang, Zhao Kuiyi, Shao Xiangqing, Zhang Qiyu, and his students Wang Beiping, Dong Xinqin, etc. The funeral procession departed at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and the coffin was temporarily placed at the South Factory of the Siming Public Hall. Mr. Li had two sons, the eldest son Li Ping, currently serving as the chief clerk of the Second Special District Court, and the second son Shiqi, working in the Postal Administration. Mr. Li had many writings during his lifetime, including the unpublished "Manuscripts of Tuo Sou" and "Notes on Siming," which will be edited and published by his students Wang Beiping and others. During his lifetime, he made many plans for the affairs of the association, and he was particularly kind and approachable. Since the news of his death spread, everyone has been extremely saddened. Mr. Li was 66 years old. When his wife passed away last month, he wrote a couplet that read, "Has Qing truly been freed? Parting in old age is a common occurrence," "I am already declining greatly; the meeting in the Yellow Springs will not be long." It became a prophecy, which is also strange.

### Explosion of Water-Heater in Shanghai Bank

Two Dead, One Injured, Cook Foreman Detained

A tragic water-heater explosion occurred at the head office of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank at 50 Ningbo Road at around 6:00 AM yesterday. One person was killed on the spot, one person was injured, and one person was crushed to death. The water-heater room of the bank is located in the lower level of a cement building behind the Shanghai Bank Building on Jiangxi Road. Cooks Xu Zulin, Wang Caijin, Zhang Jinlong, and others were hired to specialize in this task. In addition, Zhu Fenglan and Xu Jiarui were hired as assistants. Wang, Zhang, and Xu worked in three shifts each day, managing three steam boilers. Zhang Jinlong was on the early shift yesterday, and Zhu Fenglan and Xu Jiarui were also assisting on the shift. Unexpectedly, the steam gauge on the boiler was leaking, which was not noticed at the time. Zhang and others, seeing that the water gauge had not risen, thought that the temperature might not be sufficient, so they doubled the amount of coal and started the fire, causing the temperature to exceed the pressure without being noticed. As a result, after a short while, an explosion occurred. Zhang Jinlong was quick to dodge and was not harmed. Xu Jiarui burned his right hand. However, Zhu Fenglan, being directly in the path of the explosion, was burned to death. At the same time, the lower-level cement ceiling was also blasted into a dome, directly piercing the boiler room on the first floor. The east-facing wall collapsed due to the shock. At that time, a garbage collector from Jiangbei, Pan Weihan, happened to be sweeping garbage next to the garbage can by the wall. Unable to escape, he was crushed under the wall bricks and rubble. By the time he was pulled out, he was already dead. At that time, the Central Police Station and the Central Fire Brigade also received the news and rushed to the scene to handle the aftermath immediately. They first sent the injured to the hospital for treatment and then transported the bodies of the deceased to the autopsy center to await examination. Afterwards, the police station summoned Wang Caijin, the foreman of the boiler room, for questioning. Fortunately, yesterday was Sunday, and the accident occurred at dawn. The bank's office staff had not yet arrived, and other than the dead and injured workers in the boiler room, there were no other casualties. It was indeed a great fortune within misfortune.

### Liquidation of the American Eastern Bank Nears Completion

Payments May Be Made in April

The Shanghai News reports that on December 13th of last year, the liquidators of the American Eastern Bank announced that they had recovered 1.3 million yuan in outstanding debts, while the amount of liabilities was approximately 4 million yuan. At that time, they were engaged in investigating the claims of various creditors, believing that it could be completed by the end of February of this year. It was later learned that the time required for the investigation was longer than expected, but as of today, it is almost complete. It is estimated that before March 15th, the plan on how to settle will be announced to the creditors, and the creditors will be given the opportunity to raise objections. By April, the recoverable funds may be distributed to the various accounts. Since the announcement of the amount of funds recovered in December of last year, it is said that several additional amounts have been recovered.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (12)

Question: I have several relatives living in the countryside inland. Every month, I purchase postal money orders from the post office, seal them in registered letters, and send them. After the recipient receives them, they entrust someone to take the money order to the local money order exchange post office in a nearby city to collect the money. However, the recipient is an elderly woman who cannot sign her name and has no seal. It is not inconvenient to find a guarantor in the countryside when receiving registered letters. However, when taking the ticket to the city to exchange money, difficulties often arise due to the seal and guarantor issues. I recently saw in the 10th issue of the Q&A compiled by your company, regarding a section on mail held for collection at the post office, that "it is best for the recipient to use a postal identity certificate to prove their identity when collecting the mail to simplify the process." Since the postal identity certificate can be used as proof for collecting mail held for collection, can all registered mail and postal remittances also be delivered based on this identity certificate, without requiring the recipient to sign or seal separately? Also, what does the identity certificate look like, where can it be obtained, and what are the procedures? Please provide details.

Answer: Postal identity certificates are issued by post offices in various countries in accordance with the provisions of the International Postal Convention, specifically for certificate holders to collect mail, exchange remittances, and prove that they are the same person when conducting other business with the post office. The identity certificates issued by the Chinese Post Office are sold by the postal administrations in each district. Any citizen of the country who is 20 years old or older can purchase them. Each certificate costs 50 cents in national currency, which is indicated by a postage stamp affixed inside the certificate. The certificate is rectangular, made of sturdy thin cardstock, folded into two pages. The cover contains the words "International Postal Union, Republic of China Post Office" in Chinese and French, as well as three French articles as follows: "1. This certificate is used as proof that the certificate holder is the same person in postal business matters. 2. This certificate is issued exclusively by the post office and is valid for three years. If the appearance of the certificate holder changes during the validity period, causing it to be inconsistent with the photo or description inside the certificate, a new certificate must be replaced. 3. The post office is not responsible for any disputes arising from the loss or theft of this certificate by others." The back of the certificate indicates the certificate holder's facial features, and the first page inside the certificate is signed by the certificate holder, their half-length photo is pasted, and a postmark is stamped on the top of the seam, and a 50-cent postage stamp is pasted on the bottom, and the post office date stamp is affixed. The second page records the certificate holder's name and address, signed by the post office director of the issuing post office and stamped with the date stamp. However, this identity certificate is a kind of proof for the certificate holder to replace the guarantor for receiving mail and remittances. For mail and remittance payments that require receipts to be drawn, the certificate holder should still sign and seal the relevant receipt and money order, and present the identity certificate at the same time to prove that they are the same person, so that the post office can deliver the item in accordance with the regulations when there is any doubt about the seal or signature, as the identity certificate is available as proof. In short, for receiving mail and remittances with receipts, the postal identity certificate and signature seal are complementary and are not used as a replacement for signature seal. Moreover, when purchasing the identity certificate, the certificate holder must also sign and seal inside the certificate and in the special register prepared by the post office. Therefore, this identity certificate is not very suitable for people who cannot sign their names or have no seals. As for the situation you described, the post office has another remedy, that is, if the amount of the remittance you send is between one yuan and twenty yuan and has no odd numbers, you can use a small amount money order (now called a agency money order) remitted to the postal agency near the countryside where the recipient lives, which is more convenient to exchange. The procedure for purchasing a small amount money order is roughly the same as for an ordinary money order, but the envelope for sealing the money order and registered letter is supplied by the post office that remits the money, and the remitter seals the small amount money order and the registered letter together on the spot and hands them over to the bureau for mailing. After arrival, the recipient only needs to personally or entrust someone to take the envelope together with the small amount money order to the designated nearby postal agency to exchange money based on the envelope, without signing or sealing the money order. For detailed information, you can inquire at the post office's remittance window.

### Research on Improving Village and Field Appearance (Continued)

— Niu Yongjian

— Lecture at Yutang People's Education Center —

The above are all driven primarily by ambition and diligence. Other necessary tools, spare time, and financial resources are by no means difficult to obtain.

The above-mentioned plan for improving the appearance of villages and fields only addresses the most urgent, simple, and practical aspects of tidiness, cleanliness, hygiene, and aesthetics. If even these cannot be addressed, then China will not be a civilized country. There is no need to discuss various constructions, nor can we talk about abolishing unequal treaties. Therefore, the above items must be completed first. Other matters that take more time, money, and tools, as well as undertakings that require vast financial resources and advanced academic knowledge, and necessary constructions, can be carried out in the second stage.

The improvement of village and field appearance is something that people in various countries around the world almost automatically devote themselves to, in order to strive for the glory of their country. In places with lower cultures, such as emerging countries or colonies, it is also necessary to rely on the supervision of police officers and the guidance of teachers to strive for this goal in order to survive in the human world. In Asia, such as Japan, Siam, Annam, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc., wherever we go, we see tidiness, cleanliness, hygiene, and aesthetics, which can prove this.

Since we recognize that the key to improving the appearance of villages and fields lies in education, youth, and local autonomy, we hope that colleagues in the education sector will promote social guidance organizations to provide scientific and common-sense practical enlightenment on various aspects of village and field appearance, so that people can easily understand; on the other hand, autonomous organizations should add training on tidying up villages and fields when training autonomous personnel: and attach the task of tidying up villages and fields to the training, so as to act as police officers on behalf of village autonomy and practically supervise and correct various matters of village and field improvement; in particular, we hope that the heads of autonomous organizations will use their legal powers to strictly monitor, diligently implement, and distinguish between urgent and easy matters, set deadlines, implement reforms, and ensure that the sights of filth, disorder, dilapidation, and decay no longer occur in our Shanghai county, gradually spreading to the entire province and the entire country, so that our Chinese nation will not be despised by the world, and the local benefits obtained will also be significant. (The End)

### Seven Robbers, Male and Female, Caught on Bansongyuan Road

Attempted Robbery Thwarted, Arrests Made First, Two Box Cannons Also Confiscated

Around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Qian Daxiong, captain of the Sixth Squad of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Detective Brigade, received a tip-off that a gang of robbers was planning to rob a certain family at No. 182, Bansongyuan Road, Nanshi. After receiving the report, Captain Qian immediately reported to Brigade Commander Liu Huai, ordering him to lead squad leader Liu Bingyuan and all detectives, dressed in disguise, to Bansongyuan Road and its vicinity to lie in ambush. Before long, the gang of robbers arrived one after another. After being identified by the informant, the detectives gave a signal and swarmed out. The bandits were unable to resist and were captured on the spot, including seven men and women. However, some suspects may be among them. Two box cannons were seized from the hands of two robbers, each with eight live rounds in the magazine, and they were taken to the team. According to the confessions of the robbers, (1) Zhang Changfa, age 40, (2) Zhang Haiqing, age 28, (3) Gao Huaixin, age 28, (4) Xu Bangquan, age 29, (5) Wang Sen, age 29, (6) Jin Huaqing, age 30, and (7) a woman named Chuan Shishi, age 56. Among them, except for Wang, who is from Dantu, and Jin, who is from Wuhu, the rest all confessed to being from Anhui. The two box cannons were seized from Zhang Changfa and Wang Sen. According to the confessions of the robbers, they robbed Wang Dechang's family on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, in January of this year. The team considered the case important, so they immediately escorted them to the Detective Brigade for questioning. Currently, they are being investigated for any other robberies they may have committed, and the remaining gang members are being pursued. Once the investigation is clear, they will be transferred to the Third Section for disposal.

Economic Supplement

### Sichuan's Finances and Economy Over the Past Two Years

— Gan Cishen

Since the suppression of the Red Army concluded and the new Sichuan Provincial Government was established (February of the 24th year of the Republic), the overall situation in Sichuan Province has ostensibly transitioned from a chaotic and complex phase to a clear and unified state. The establishment of fiscal budgets, promotion of production and construction, and implementation of abolishing some harsh and miscellaneous taxes along with rural relief are all highly optimistic signs. However, the substance of these phenomena may still be viewed with suspicion, and the degree to which they satisfy is not immediate. Friends who have traveled or investigated in Sichuan Province often bring back extremely different and contradictory impressions. This may be a reflection of this phenomenon. Now that the 25th year of the Republic has passed, and the new administration in Sichuan Province has been in place for a full two years, discussing the current state of Sichuan's finances and economy at this time may be something those who care about Sichuan affairs would like to hear.

㊀ A Finance Barely Making Ends Meet

I remember that a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao once criticized the current state of Sichuan's finances as moving from "having wealth without governance" to "harsh but not disruptive" (Note 1). This statement is not at all an exaggeration. Before the 24th year of the Republic, Sichuan Province was in a state of warlord separatism, where the collection of all taxes and the expenditure of all funds were based solely on the will of the local military and political leaders. There was no budget, nor a fixed tax rate. Due to the squandering of funds by the military personnel themselves and the needs of war, the people's burden was constantly increasing. Land taxes were pre-collected up to the 70th or 80th year of the Republic, and commodity taxes exceeded their original value by one or two times, which can be said to have been "commonplace" at that time.

The result of this endless plunder was rural bankruptcy, obstruction of commerce, and all sorts of unbearable and distressing situations. Therefore, when the new provincial government was established in February of the 24th year of the Republic, the government immediately took "renewal with the people" as its slogan, announced new laws for reorganizing taxes, and compiled the budget for the 24th year of the Republic.

The establishment of the Sichuan Province fiscal budget for the 24th year of the Republic was quite difficult because, on the one hand, it had to consider the people's burden, and on the other hand, there were huge military expenditures. Under these difficult circumstances, the government had no choice but to sacrifice the former and adopt the so-called temporary military expense collection method during the bandit suppression period, replacing the previous pre-collection. The collection of temporary military expenses was based on adding three times the land tax as temporary military expenses. In other words, land tax had to be collected four times a year. This method naturally reduced the burden considerably in places where the collection had been very harsh in the past. However, in places where the extraction was lighter in the past, it was much heavier than before. Calculated on a provincial average, the amount of income can be said to have had no increase or decrease. As for taxes, the laws and regulations promulgated by the government were intended to eliminate the previous harsh and miscellaneous taxes and implement a unified tax system. However, the tax rate of the unified tax system was not lighter than the sum of the harsh and miscellaneous taxes added together. Although this reduced the pain that merchants had previously suffered from being held up at checkpoints, in terms of burden, it was no different. It is no wonder that a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao criticized it as "harsh but not disruptive," and the author could not help but righteously and indignantly condemn this method in another article as "ineffective by relying solely on lip service." (Note 2)

Although the tax measures did not reduce the burden on the people, the result of their implementation in terms of income was that the area affected by natural disasters and banditry expanded, and land tax revenues decreased. Furthermore, the central government held unified taxes, and local taxes on imported goods such as cotton yarn and cigarettes were suspended, further reducing income. On the expenditure side, military expenses, which were unavoidable, were often outside the budget. This meant that the budget balance that the government had painstakingly created had to be disrupted. According to official figures, the revenue and expenditure deficit for the first nine months of the 24th year of the Republic reached a huge 15 million yuan!

The government did not lack ways to make up for this large revenue and expenditure deficit. In addition to issuing the second rehabilitation public bond of 20 million yuan (issued on April 1 of the 25th year of the Republic), the implementation of business taxes (local taxes were still collected as usual), security expenses (one year's worth of land tax), local surcharges, and the successive collection of other harsh and miscellaneous taxes all became means of collecting money. These heavy burdens meant that the people of Sichuan, who had been suffering from excessive taxes and levies for more than 20 years, did not get a single chance to recover. Even the chairman of the province, Liu Xiang, could not help but express the sentiment that "over the past year, no work has been done to reduce the burden on the people of Sichuan."

The financial difficulties of the 24th year of the Republic were barely overcome. The fiscal budget for the 25th year of the Republic, after many discussions and revisions by important figures in the central government and the provincial government, was also announced in mid-August. The budget for this year obviously increased in numbers compared with the previous year, but its nature was no different. The content of the two-year budget is briefly shown in the following table (Note 3): (in units of thousands of national currency)

Revenue Section

Comparing the fiscal budgets for the two years, we can see several characteristics of the fiscal budget for the 25th year of the Republic: First, the method of adding three times the land tax as temporary military expenses has not changed. This makes us unable to help but wonder whether the so-called lie of relieving the people's difficulties is permanently just a dream that is difficult to realize? Second, the budget numbers have swelled. In terms of income, new items such as business tax, land tax, registration tax, and unified mining tax have been added. Is the income from these new taxes really guaranteed, or is it just to support the large expenditures on military affairs and debt? Third, in this year's fiscal budget, expenditures are still dominated by military affairs and debt, accounting for as much as 80% to 90% of the total expenditure. Because this phenomenon requires supporting large military expenditures, on the one hand, other government expenditures have to be reduced, hindering the development of culture and construction. On the other hand, the burden on the people has to be increased. In both of these aspects, there are shortcomings, so we have to borrow heavily and increase debt expenditures. On this cyclical path, the people are naturally "burned out," and the government is showing its "painstaking efforts." Regarding this year's budget, we have seen Ji Zuyou, who was in charge of the former financial department, make the following statement (Note 4):

"(...... Above omitted) Regarding the budget for the 25th year of the Republic, Director Liu is fully responsible for handling it. The actual amount of revenue and expenditure is about 85.6 million. After reporting it to the central government, the Ministry of Finance made slight changes to the revenue and expenditure. The most important thing is to hope to reduce military expenses. Considering the current situation in Sichuan, "military expenses account for about one-half of the total budget, which is naturally a bit large, but in fact, there is absolutely no other way to reduce it. Therefore, I met with President Chiang to explain the situation in Sichuan before finalizing the numbers. (......) Although the numbers have been finalized, some numbers require a lot of effort or other methods to make up for them. Now let's take the income from land tax as an example. The initially set number for this year was 26 million yuan. The amount collected in the 24th year was only 20 million yuan. Even if we work very hard this year, the maximum increase would only be 1-2 million yuan. It is very difficult to reach the number of 26 million yuan. Secondly, there is the fine for opium suppression. Last year's income was less than 6 million yuan, while this year's budget lists it as 9 million yuan. The number has increased by 3 million yuan. At this time when opium suppression is strict and the population of smokers is gradually decreasing, how can the income from fines increase? Thirdly, let's talk about business tax. The budget for business tax can collect more than 3.6 million yuan, but everyone generally believes that Chongqing, which has the highest income, has a maximum of only 40,000 yuan per month. In the whole of Sichuan, plus the counties with slightly higher income, it will definitely not reach the budget number. In this way, there are another 2 million yuan that are hoped for. In short, about 10 million yuan of the income budget listed for the 25th year can be considered to be reliable. President Chiang also said to Director Liu that these unreliable numbers are included in the budget, which is the most taboo thing for financial officers. In fact, how could Director Liu not know, but he was afraid that if the income numbers were reduced, the 40 million yuan in military expenses would definitely have problems, and the impact would be so significant. Therefore, he knowingly did it and had to take responsibility for finding other ways to make up for it. Speaking of the method of making up for it, what he has already thought of is to issue new deeds, which can increase a portion of the income in terms of budget income. Because Sichuan was in the era of defense zones in the past, people always thought of various ways to avoid paying taxes when buying and selling houses, and there were many illegal and unqualified deeds. Now that it is a unified period, we should reorganize and issue new deeds, and slightly charge for labor and handling fees. With the vast land of Sichuan, the income will be considerable" (Below omitted)

It turns out that the method of "finding other ways" is still nothing more than "issuing new deeds" to the people. The financial difficulties of Sichuan Province and the suffering of the people of Sichuan are evident from this.

㊁ The Deteriorating Industry

Regarding Sichuan's economic position, the author once said the following in the preface to a book (Note 5):

"From the analysis of Sichuan's import and export commodities, we can clearly understand the economic position in which Sichuan Province is located. Among the 22 important imported commodities that we have selected, almost all of them are machine-made goods or machine products. The 20+ important export commodities are mostly raw materials and unfinished products such as mountain goods and medicinal materials. Among the machine-made goods, what we must pay special attention to is the particularly large import volume of daily necessities such as fabrics and food, and the meager import volume of machine production equipment. This not only shows that the industrial foundation of our province is extremely weak, but also that we need to rely on foreign countries for basic necessities. This is something that we should deeply alert ourselves to."

Sichuan's industrial position is that of a supplier of raw production materials. Some people say that Sichuan is the "Land of Abundance" because it still has unexploited resources (although the actual situation may not be as perfect as ideal). Others praise its "abundant products". Sichuan is not unworthy of this title because, among all the necessities of life, Sichuan can be self-sufficient, except for the raw materials for "clothing," which are slightly lacking. However, have the abundant products been firmly protected? Can the existing industries really maintain or have the hope of rising? We are rather pessimistic after examining the situation in recent years.

When we mention Sichuan's products, the first thing that comes to our mind is silk. Sichuan is one of the three major sericultural areas in China. The annual output is about 15-16 million customs taels. When exports are booming, the value is 11-12 million customs taels per year. However, in recent years, due to the harassment of harsh taxes, the devastation of natural disasters and wars, the competition of foreign silk, and the impact of the global recession, it has plummeted. The bleak and declining situation is really unbearable to talk about. We only need to look at the following numbers to know.

Table of Sichuan's Export Volume and Value of Raw Silk in the Last Decade (Note 6) Quantity (Dan) Value (Customs Taels) Year

If we compare the above numbers with the number of silk mills that have closed down in Chongqing, Rongchang, and Wanxian in recent years, it is really shocking.

Cowhide and sheepskin are also major exports from Sichuan Province. Their products are known for their strong leather and dense fibers, and are deeply praised by Europeans and Americans. In recent years, in addition to suffering from the same natural and man-made disasters, exports have also been greatly reduced due to export merchants disregarding credit and cutting off their own path. However, the degree of decline is not as severe as that of raw silk and several other products.

Sichuan's medicinal materials are extremely famous in China. Because of their many varieties and good quality, they are sold at home and abroad, and have always occupied an important position in Sichuan's exports. In recent years, due to the competition of foreign medicines and Japanese imitations, and because the people are following old methods and not making improvements, the output is also much worse than before. There are also ramie cloth, tobacco leaves, gallnuts, and paper, etc., which are showing alarming declines for almost the same reasons! We can see this by reading the numbers in the table below.

Table of Sichuan's Export Value of Ramie Cloth, Tobacco Leaves, Gallnuts, and Paper in the Last Decade Unit: 10,000 Customs Taels (Note 7)

The above table only represents the general situation (readers who want to know more details should refer to the book "Statistics on Sichuan Province's Import and Export Trade in the Last 45 Years" compiled by the author). In summary, Sichuan's products in recent years have generally shown a large decline, and the reasons for the decline are nothing more than internal and external ones. Whether these reasons can be eliminated is a major issue for the future. Speaking of the development of Sichuan's industry, this is what we should pay close attention to.

In the situation where Sichuan's general products are showing a decline, only tung oil and bristles maintain a unique trend. This is caused by the special needs of the current international market. We should be happy about the current situation of these two products, but we must expect ourselves to work harder for the future of these two products.

㊂ Let's Talk About Transportation and Construction

The achievements of Sichuan Province in the two years since the implementation of the new administration may have seen some success in suppressing bandits and reforming officialdom. Reducing the burden is just empty talk. Then, the only major achievement may be the construction of transportation and economy. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has progressed from preparation to construction in a rapid progress. The completion of this railway is of great significance to Sichuan's politics, economy, and culture. We wish it a smooth success.

The progress of highway construction in Sichuan Province in recent years is also worth noting. 3,763 kilometers of highways have been completed in a short period of several years. 1,200 kilometers of new routes are also being rapidly opened up. The completion of these thousands of kilometers of highways has not only solved a part of Sichuan's transportation problems, but is also a history of blood and tears for the people of Sichuan.

Before the era of the defense zone system, the funds for road construction in Sichuan Province were mostly raised by the authorities' compulsory allocation or additional land taxes. The system was extremely chaotic, and the waste was very large, while the results obtained were very small. In the 23rd year, the government announced the order of compulsory labor, and most of the time, this method was adopted. With compulsory labor, the government does not give any compensation. The conscripted laborers not only have to provide their own food and bedding, but also have to bring road-building tools, such as hoes, shovels, carrying poles, and ropes. This method may have its advantages in theory, but if it cannot be properly applied, its drawbacks are really unimaginable. People who have been suffering for a long time and have no support are eating tree bark, mud, grass roots, bran, and chaff to serve the country. We read a record of a certain educator's on-site observation of compulsory labor for road construction in Sichuan Province, and we can imagine the situation of that group of white-haired children enduring hunger and rolling around in the dust. For the sake of humanity, we should not be indifferent!

The provincial government has been actively carrying out the work of developing Sichuan's products in the past two years. There is a planned and concrete adjustment plan. It has been promoted from the "experts'" desks to the vast countryside. In particular, the work of promoting agriculture seems to attract more attention. According to the report of the Construction Department, the achievements in agricultural promotion are roughly as follows.

Rice and wheat are the main crops in Sichuan, and the output is quite considerable. In recent years, due to the impact of natural and man-made disasters, Sichuan's products have been difficult to be self-sufficient. The Construction Department's plan to improve rice and wheat production first focuses on the investigation of the total output and consumption of the province, and then engages in the improvement of varieties and the prevention of disasters. Last year, the Construction Department and the Agricultural College of Sichuan University jointly formed the Sichuan Rice and Wheat Experimental Farm (now renamed the Improvement Institute), attempting to promote the excellent varieties obtained to various regions. It is not yet possible to determine what the results will be.

Sugarcane is also a specialty of Sichuan, but because the manufacturing is not precise and the quality is poor, it has not had any special development in foreign sales in the past. In view of this, the Construction Department transported more than 6,000 kilograms of Javanese sugarcane seeds back from Shanghai this summer, established a sugarcane experimental farm in Neijiang, and plans to establish a sugar factory with an annual output of more than 10,000 tons in Neijiang this year to adapt to the output after two years of promoting improved sugarcane varieties. It is planned to complete the production plan of 100,000 tons of refined sugar per year within five years.

We have already talked about the situation of Sichuan silk in the previous chapter. The government, in view of the disastrous failure of the silk industry in the past, established the Silk Bureau, attempting to complete the silk revival plan in a controlled manner. In the past, there was a silkworm breeding improvement farm in Nanchong, and it is said that the improved silkworm cocoons released have had good results. Now, the state-private joint venture raw silk trading company has also been established in Chongqing, so the problem of Sichuan silk transportation and sales can probably be solved in the future.

Tung oil in eastern Sichuan has been a darling of China's international trade commodities in recent years. The establishment of the Plant Oil Bureau recently will definitely be of great help in improving pressing, promoting transportation, and sales in the future.

In addition, the preparation of cotton experiment farms, the establishment of livestock conservation centers, the promotion of nurseries, and the investigation of forest land are all being actively promoted. We cannot help but say that the authorities are doing their best to value agricultural production.

In the current atmosphere of extremely strong production and construction in Sichuan Province, we feel that there are three extremely serious problems: The first is the problem of talent and technology, and the second is a prerequisite for developing industry. In recent years, the provincial government has reportedly recruited a considerable number of specialized talents, including, of course, many experts in various industries. The status of experts in the industry is often transcendent, and the rewards they enjoy are particularly generous. Experts who live up to their name can certainly develop the industry, but on the contrary, they can often become an obstacle to the industry. Following the old ways, delaying things, and wasting public funds are all common facts. We hope that there are no such facts among the experts who are helping with the construction of Sichuan Province, but we cannot guarantee that there are no such facts. In addition to the difficulty of finding experts, the training of cadres is also a considerable problem. The authorities do not seem to lack expressions of effort in this regard, but under many difficult prerequisites, we dare not lightly trust its effectiveness.

The second is the problem of funding. The annual expenditure on construction in the fiscal budget is very small. The only way to raise funds is to borrow money. Recently, the provincial government has submitted a request to the central government to issue construction bonds of 20 million yuan, which is a comforting thing in Sichuan, where public bonds have historically been exchanged for military supplies in internal wars. However, the issuance of public bonds has considerable burdens and considerable limitations. If proper allocation is not sought in the expenditure items, it is clear that this is not a permanent solution.

The third is the problem of the system. The industries that the authorities are currently promoting clearly have a tendency to focus on agriculture. Should the development of Sichuan's industry focus on industry, or should it focus on agriculture, or should both be given equal importance? If both are given equal importance, which should come first? This is a question worth studying and a question that needs to be decided urgently. More concrete plans should also be required for the mode (or system) of industrial operation. The policy currently adopted by the government is very similar to the form of a controlled economy. Then, the problems that should be considered for this system should be thoroughly resolved first, and there should be clear guidance in order to obtain focus and concentrate the goal of efforts!

Economic construction should be initiated by the entire public. It is not just the government's business, nor is it someone's business. The scope that individual hard work can contribute is very small, and the government's promotion inevitably falls into "official rhetoric." Speaking of Sichuan's economic construction, if we open our eyes and look at the lives of the masses of people in Sichuan, we should know where the key is.

㊃ Extremely Miserable Famine

In last year's nationwide celebration of a bumper harvest, disaster-stricken Sichuan suffered an unprecedented famine. This famine was truly unprecedented in its vast scope, and its type and degree were also very frightening and shocking!

In the drought in Sichuan Province in the 25th year, no county in the east, west, north, or south of Sichuan was not equally serious. The disaster reports that the provincial government received and the disaster news seen in the newspapers almost flew in like snowflakes, filling our ears and eyes. In June, rice prices in various places had soared from more than 2 yuan per dou to a high price of 4 yuan. Although there was government relief to stabilize the market, the effect was still very small.

A severe drought in the summer and a hopeless autumn harvest were already unbearable! It is well known that "Heaven does not tire of disasters," and then came the vicious "autumn drought," depriving the people of a lifeline. In September, the author was a guest in a rural village in eastern Sichuan, and saw the tragic situation of thousands of acres of red land. Listening to an old farmer talking to me about the crisis of the spring famine made people shudder for the land of 70 million people. The direct product of the famine is "green terror." Now, all the slightly remote places in Sichuan have created a great threat, and this power is not only developing in remote places.

The poisonous flames of the drought are still burning, and then there is a flood alarm, which is truly the so-called "misfortune never comes singly." The four river basins of the Jialing, Minjiang, Tuojiang, and Fujiang rivers in Sichuan were flooded, and the area affected by the disaster reached dozens of counties, and the loss of population and property cannot be counted.

Due to the lack of statistics, we cannot provide a more concrete number for this disaster for the time being. However, according to general observations, there has not been such a severe disaster in the history of the past ten years. Relief methods are currently being planned, but whether "a drop in the bucket" can have much effect, no one dares to say for sure.

Summarizing the above observations, we know that the burden on the people of Sichuan has not been reduced, and there is still no solution to the finances of Sichuan Province. Although there are considerable plans for economic construction, the people are poor and the treasury is empty, and even a clever woman cannot cook without rice. More serious is the current famine and the dangerous seeds it has sown. Although we may not be so pessimistic about the future of Sichuan Province, the current difficulties are also undeniable facts. How it will develop in the future depends entirely on the joint efforts of the government and the people.

### Market for Securities and Bonds Exhibits a State of Flux

Last week, the public bond market was relatively calm. Due to the contention between bulls and bears, the market condition showed a state of flux. Retail investors' buying power was quite strong. However, rumors of powerful financial institutions engaging in significant selling persisted. Recently, bonds numbered 45, 46, and 35 have been continuously and aggressively sold off. Consequently, while the market price lacked the strength to rise, it also found it difficult to fall, gradually creating a brewing situation. However, observing the firm and buoyant market sentiment and the stability of the current situation, it is unlikely that there will be a sudden drop. Throughout the week, the market experienced the following: On Monday, major players holding bonds 45 and 46 continued to aggressively release large quantities, creating a very strong momentum. Bonds such as 戊 and 乙 uniformly fell by 4.5 to 1.1 yuan. Tuesday was the last day for February futures. The market process was quite stable, but due to major players continuing to release chips, the market price continued to weaken by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The Fuxing Public Bonds rose sharply by 4 yuan to the limit due to the depletion of spot goods. On Monday, only March futures were traded, and retail investors' buying was extremely strong. The market condition tended to rise due to a state of flux. On Thursday, initially, the market was very bullish due to the introduction of April futures, and prices rose quite strongly. Subsequently, bonds numbered 35, 5, and 31, acting on behalf of a certain bank, conducted a large-scale sell-off, and the market price fell again by 0.2 to 0.65 yuan. Friday was the closing of the February futures delivery. On Saturday, major players continued to sell slowly, while retail investors' buying was also strong. Due to the standoff between bulls and bears, the market condition rose from a state of flux. The overall result for the week was that February and March futures fell by varying amounts, ranging from 0.15 to 1.1 yuan. April futures were newly introduced, and the total transaction volume was 42.09 million yuan. A comparison of the rises and falls is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan), total:

### Yarn and Cotton: Robust Buying of Nearby and Distant Months

Yesterday, upon the opening of the American cotton market, news from Liverpool was good. Traders and spot merchants bought nearby months. Foreign merchants and new off-market accounts favored distant-month New Orleans, buying May. All months rose by 3 to 5 points. Subsequently, due to hedging and large-scale long positions being closed out, there was a slight pullback. According to a report from the Goods and Loan Society, 415,291 bales of pledged cotton had been sold as of the 25th. Before the close, due to strong spot market activity and optimistic sentiment, short positions were continuously covered, and the market rose again, closing strong. The spot price rose by 7 points, and futures prices rose by 6 to 9 points. English cotton spot price fell by 1 point, and futures prices rose by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying from European exporters and positive Liverpool telegrams, and short covering. Later, it retraced due to long liquidation. Broach rose by 1 to 1.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 1 to 1.15 rupees, and Bengal Desi rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 27th): American Cotton compared to the previous day, Legal Tender, English Cotton compared to the previous day, Legal Tender.

According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the first of the month was: Bengal Desi at 226 rupees, Oomra at 207.5 rupees, and Broach at 180 rupees, all up 0.25 rupees. American Cotton Weekend Statistics (unit: thousands of bales)

### Food Grains and River Rice: Stagnant Sales in Retail and Wholesale Markets

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various gangs only reached about a dozen, totaling approximately 3,400 to 3,500 shi, with thin rice accounting for half of the volume. Although the supply was not large, both retail and wholesale markets were sluggish. Only the Xi'an gang bought over 300 packages of thin rice. Therefore, the market condition was mediocre. The prices of thick and thin粳 rice were generally soft. The passage of Duyang pointed rice was particularly sluggish, with prices falling by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, approximately 20 boats from various gangs along the river arrived at the閘. Sales of various goods in the market were lackluster. The price of white粳 rice slightly increased by a few cents, while the price of early thin rice decreased by another 0.7 to 0.8 cents. The price of Yangshe pointed rice fell by a small amount of 0.5 to 0.6 cents. The price of Yinbian Yuan rice also showed a downward trend. At the close of the market, transactions in various goods became more active, and prices stabilized.

### Review of the American Economic Boom and Raw Silk Consumption (II)

— Wang Tianyu

3. General Fiber Consumption During Economic Prosperity

The economic boom in the United States undoubtedly led to an increase in people's purchasing power. According to the League of Nations Monthly Bulletin, the consumer price index for the United States, with 1919 as 100, reached its lowest point in 1932 at only 75.9. It then rose year by year, reaching 84.2 in 1933, 83.4 in 1934, and 87.6 in 1935. In 1936, it rose even further, reaching 91.6 in January and 95.2 in July. This kind of consumption boom naturally applied to textile fibers used for clothing. The fiber consumption index published in Analyst exceeded the average annual figure in January 1936. By mid-August, it had risen by a quarter, as shown in the table below:

U.S. Fiber Consumption Index (Average Year = 100) 1936

The above table clearly indicates that the consumption trends of raw silk differ from those of other fibers, especially when compared to rayon, which is quite similar in appearance to raw silk and is often used as a substitute. From this, we can see that the recovery of the consumer price index in the United States in recent years has not had any particularly positive impact on raw silk consumption. If we further examine the consumption quantity trends after the economic crisis of 1929, based on the survey by the National Federation of Textile Industries of America, we can gain a clearer understanding:

U.S. Raw Silk Consumption Statistics (Unit: bales) (Note): Ordinary year from January to November, business year from July to the following June.

Based on the above table, it can be seen that there is not much recovery in the consumption of raw silk. Looking at the ordinary year, last year barely exceeded the level of 1933; but compared to the previous five or six years, it was still about 100,000 dan behind. However, when observed from the business year, it has been decreasing almost year by year; this is also a point that cannot be ignored. Furthermore, according to the ordinary year, although the consumption quantity of raw silk showed an increase in the previous year, it actually showed the same downward trend when compared to the total consumption of fibers. According to the American "Textile Organ," the ratio of raw silk consumption quantity was 2.2% of the total fibers in 1930, 2.4% in 1932, reduced to 1.9% in 1934, and only accounted for 1.8% in 1935. The only fiber with a straight upward trend was rayon, which accounted for 7.2% of the total amount by 1935; an increase of 29% compared to 1934, while raw silk only increased by about 7%.

4. Analysis of Raw Silk Consumption

Although the American economy experienced a further rise last year, the consumption quantity of raw silk in the past ten months decreased by 53,000 bales compared to the same period last year, with an average monthly decrease of over 5,000 bales. Among them, except for August and September, which exceeded the previous year by several hundred bales, the largest decrease occurred in February, reaching nearly 10,000 bales. The smallest decrease was in June, also around 2,300 bales. It can be seen that the pessimistic views of many people are not without reason. Based on the figures published in the Monthly Bulletin of Silk Statistics, the comparison of the consumption quantity of American raw silk last year with the same period of the previous year is shown below to illustrate a point:

Comparison of U.S. Raw Silk Consumption Quantity (▲ indicates decrease) Increase/Decrease

Note: Unit: bales, one bale is equivalent to one dan.

Based on the above table, it can be seen that the decrease in American raw silk consumption quantity averaged about 12.5% in ten months, and the highest decrease rate was nearly a quarter. Furthermore, according to the total number of these ten months, it is estimated that the total consumption for the entire year last year will not exceed 450,000 dan, which is a sharp decrease of more than 25% from the peak period of 600,000 dan, and is an unprecedented phenomenon since the economic crisis. At this critical juncture of the American economic recovery, the decrease in raw silk consumption is surprisingly unexpected. (To be continued)

### Tinplate: Actual Sales Not Smooth

Since the囤 users have existing goods for sale, and shipments from Japan have also arrived, the market appearance of tinplate is extremely weak. Standard asking prices have generally loosened compared to before. Three-foot, six-foot sheets are selling for 1.22 to 1.23 yuan per sheet, a decrease of 0.02 to 0.03 yuan compared to before. Three-foot, seven-foot sheets are selling for 1.46 to 1.47 yuan, also a decrease of 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to before. Transactions by merchants are not strong because they purchased too much last year. However, sales to construction merchants and inter-trade deals are considered smooth, so the market situation is not excessively bleak.

### Factory Selling Round Nails at 13.5 Yuan

Recently, the factory price of round nails has been exceptionally firm due to the factory's lack of raw materials. Each barrel requires 13.5 yuan, a significant increase compared to before. Transactions such as those from the Yangtze River gang, inland river gang, and factories on this street are all referring to purchases, so the market situation feels particularly solid. Yesterday, over 500 to 600 barrels were still sold, reportedly sold by hardware stores in the North Suzhou Road area.

### After Reading the Declaration of the Third Plenary Session

— Lü Bing

The Third Plenary Session concluded on February 23rd. Upon reading the declaration, we feel that it thoroughly understands the current situation, determines the future trend, and considers everything comprehensively and meticulously. It is indeed the most appropriate guideline to adapt to China's environment.

In this declaration, both foreign and domestic affairs are elaborated upon. Externally, it seeks coexistence, and internally, it seeks self-reliance. The way to self-reliance lies first in national peace and unification: "...The purpose of peaceful unification is to concentrate the power of the entire country and the entire nation to overcome the current difficulties, and further to step into the path of democracy. Understanding the meaning of the entire country, it must be known that the power of governance is indivisible, especially in major aspects such as military, diplomacy, finance, and transportation, which are related to the needs of national defense, and must be fully controlled by the central government. Otherwise, partial independence will become an inferior organism and will ultimately be eliminated internationally..." These words are excellent. This is not only a resolution of the Congress but also the common desire of the national psyche.

We should know that since the founding of the Republic of China, the domestic turmoil and the deepening national crisis are rooted in the lack of national unification and peace. All military, diplomatic, financial, and transportation matters are fragmented and not subject to the central government's governance. Even in the telecommunications sector, concerning transportation, the impact of the lack of national peace and unification in the past has been significant. The entire telecommunications system originally falls under the central government's governance, but whenever there is unrest, the lines are destroyed, and most of the equipment is lost. As a result of partial independence, the central government cannot direct or audit the personnel administration related to telecommunications. In addition, arbitrary transmissions in violation of government orders and arrears in telegram fees all inflict significant blows on the telecommunications industry, making it impossible to carry out plans and extremely difficult to maintain. All of these hidden pains are deeply felt. Therefore, to seek the development of the telecommunications industry, national unification and peace are indispensable. Only with national unification and peace, under the central government's governance, can all personnel administration be subject to the central government's jurisdiction, and transmissions and payments be made in accordance with regulations. Then, the future will be clear, and there will be hope for the prosperity of telecommunications.

The Third Plenary Session has shown the people of the country what is mentioned above. Do all Chinese people want our country to become an inferior organic gift and be eliminated internationally? Please think about it again!

### Directorate General of Telecommunications Continues to Handle the Method of Returning Telegram Receipts

— Jingwen

Since the trial implementation of the method of returning telegram receipts by local telegraph offices from December 1, 1936, it has indeed provided considerable convenience to the public. However, since the trial period has only been three months, many members of the general public who send and receive telegrams are still unaware of this method, resulting in it not being widely promoted. It is now heard that the Directorate General of Telecommunications has decided to continue the trial implementation of this new business method to benefit the people for another six months from March 1 of this year to observe its effectiveness. Therefore, the advantages of this method are briefly described again as follows:

㊀ Simple Procedure: After a sender goes to the telegraph office to send a telegram, if they want the recipient's telegraph office to obtain a receipt bearing the signature and seal of the recipient, as well as the time of receipt, after the telegram is properly delivered and return it to the sender, they only need to write the words "回據" (return receipt) in the "纳费标识" (payment identification) box on the telegram paper (which can be obtained from the telegraph office) (or at the beginning of the telegram if using self-prepared paper). For example, "-回據-Nanjing Zhujiang Road Shanghai Bank". If it is a foreign language telegram, the word Rpcp should be written as an identification mark. The identification mark, whether written in Chinese or a foreign language, is charged as one word to ensure fairness. In addition, the sender only needs to prepay a postage fee of 9 cents (i.e., the postage for registered printed matter), and the procedure can be completed, which is exceptionally simple.

㊁ Wide Range of Uses: The "Telegram Receipt Received" returned by the telegraph office has the signature and seal of the recipient and can be considered evidence of receipt of the telegram in both legal and accounting contexts. If the sender properly saves the receipt or attaches it to the accounting books as a document, it is a powerful supporting document. Furthermore, business firms or individuals who send important telegrams concerning remittances, accounts, legal matters, contracts, etc., invariably hope that the other party will reply immediately to confirm receipt. If the sender adopts the above-mentioned "receipt return" method, adds the "receipt return" identification mark at the beginning of the telegram, and prepays a postage fee of 9 cents, the receiving telegraph office will, after the telegram is signed for by the recipient, send a "Telegram Receipt Received" bearing the signature and seal of the recipient to the originating telegraph office for verification of the sender's address and dispatch it to the sender. Then, after the sender receives the receipt, they can prove that the telegram they sent has been properly delivered, without having to wait for the other party's reply. The function of one receipt is virtually the same as the recipient's reply telegram. Therefore, senders generally send telegrams concerning important matters such as contracts, legal matters, accounts, remittances, etc., should adopt the "receipt return" method to obtain a receipt bearing the signature and seal of the recipient for preservation. In case of future disputes, the "Telegram Receipt Received" can serve as powerful evidence, the wide range of uses is far beyond what is expected.

㊂ Cost Savings: Senders who send telegrams with the "receipt return" identification mark added only need to pay the telegram fee for one word of the payment identification mark and prepay a postage fee of 9 cents, which is a very small cost. Furthermore, if the sender has two or more telegrams to the same city and wants to use the "receipt return" method, in addition to writing the "receipt return" or Rpcp payment identification mark on each telegram and paying the fee for one word, they only need to prepay one postage fee. The same applies to distributed telegrams. However, if a distributed telegram is to use the "receipt return" method, the sender should separately write the above-mentioned payment identification mark before the address name of each recipient, for example, "-分送-唱据-Shanghai Yuyuan Road (608弄(75)号 Wen Zhongying-回据-Xiafei Road (285) Hao Xu Jianqing," otherwise, the telegraph office will only obtain a receipt from the recipient with the "receipt return" identification mark and send it back to the originating telegraph office for delivery to the sender. The above charging method can also save senders some postage fees. It can be seen that the new business methods recently implemented by the telegraph office are all based on the principle of enhancing communication convenience and reducing the burden on senders and receivers.

㊃ Safe and Reliable: When we mail important letters and want the post office to return a receipt signed and sealed by the recipient, we invariably adopt the registered mail method. The method of returning telegram receipts, which the telegraph office is continuing to trial implement this time, is the same in nature as the post office's registered mail method. It only requires paying a postage fee of 9 cents in addition to the telegram fee to obtain one or more "Telegram Receipts Received" signed and sealed by the recipient, which is exceptionally economical, safe, and reliable. Generally speaking, telegrams sent by senders concerning contracts, legal matters, accounts, remittances, and other matters are even more important than letters, and it is also advisable to imitate the method of sending registered mail, add the "receipt return" identification mark at the beginning of the telegram or in the "payment identification" box on the telegram paper, so that the telegraph office can return the "receipt" signed and sealed by the recipient for preservation. Therefore, the effect of this telegram with the "receipt return" identification mark is virtually the same as the post office's registered mail method. All senders who send important telegrams should adopt it as much as possible to show solemnity and ensure reliability.

### Summary of the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Registration Method

— Mu Gong

Effective from Today

According to the telegram registration regulations, the recipient of a telegram may select a word—whether Chinese or English—and apply to the telegraph office for registration. All recipient names and addresses may use the word as a substitute, which is very convenient. In order to enable recipients of domestic long-distance calls to avoid errors in names and addresses when receiving long-distance calls, which may hinder the call, the Ministry of Communications, with reference to the telegram registration regulations, has permitted recipients to apply for registration with their names and addresses, and on January 14, 1937, promulgated thirteen articles of the "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Recipient Name and Address Registration Method," which came into effect on March 1 of this year. The public must pay attention to it.

Those who apply for registration should fill out an application form with the local telegraph office affiliated to the Ministry of Communications that handles long-distance telephone business in their locality. After the application is approved by the telegraph office, the telegraph office will designate a number to replace the recipient's name and address and issue a registration certificate. The recipient should then notify the relevant callers of the number. Callers may proceed as follows when making a call:

(Recipient) (City Name) (Registration Number) (Type of Call) (Caller's Phone Number and Name)

Example 1: Nanjing—Registration 315—Ordinary Call—22633 Li Wenxiu (used for calling the telegraph office)

(Type of Call) (Recipient) (City Name) (Registration Number) (Caller's Name and Address)

Example 2: Urgent Call—Tianjin—Registration 258—Liu Zi'an, 107 Xiafei Road, Shanghai (used for filling out the form at retail outlets)

According to Article 6 of the regulations: "The registration period shall be from the date of issuance of the registration certificate until the end of the year." Article 11 of the same regulations stipulates: "The telegraph office will not charge any fees for handling registration and issuing or exchanging certificates." This is superior to the telegram registration regulations. The effective period of both types of telegram registration 甲 and 乙 is calculated from the first day of the month of registration, and the effective period of telegram registration 丙 is calculated from the date of registration. The effective period of the long-distance telephone recipient name and address registration method, regardless of when the registration is made, is from the date of issuance of the registration certificate until the end of the year. In other words: this registration is calculated by year, not by month. Furthermore, the registration fee for telegram registration is 25 yuan, 10 yuan, and 1 yuan for types 甲, 乙, and 丙 respectively, while this registration does not distinguish between types and does not charge any fees. In other words: the telegraph office will serve unconditionally any long-distance telephone users who wish to use this method.

After the registration period expires, if the caller still uses the registration number to transmit a long-distance call, the receiving telegraph office may try to transmit it once and notify the recipient to continue registration. If they do not comply, the call will be discontinued thereafter. This still shows the intention of preferential treatment in the promotion of business.

### Long-Distance Telephone Communications Between Shanghai and Important Locations

— Xuan

Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, and the Ministry of Communications' national long-distance telephone construction plan stipulates that Shanghai is one of the central points. Since the completion of the nine-province long-distance telephone project, Shanghai has successively opened more than 200 telephone exchanges. In the future, after the completion of the amplification stations in various locations, all parts of the country will be able to communicate with Shanghai. Through the relay of international radio stations, it will further open communication with major commercial ports around the world. Meeting thousands of miles in one hall and resolving doubts in an instant, China's modernization spirit will be placed in the international telecommunications arena without being inferior. This is truly a great event. The prices for calls between Shanghai and important locations are listed below for reference:

The above only lists important cities because there are too many communication locations to list them all. Please inquire with the local telephone bureau or long-distance telephone retail outlets for satisfactory answers. The communication procedure is as follows: ㊀ If a telephone is installed, first call the long-distance platform of the telephone bureau, inform them of your telephone number, the recipient's location, and their name, address, or telephone number. After the long-distance platform completes the recording, hang up the receiver and wait for the call. ㊁ If you do not have a telephone installed and want to use a long-distance telephone, please register at the long-distance telephone retail outlets or public telephone offices affiliated with the telephone or telegraph bureau, prepay the communication fee once, and after obtaining the receipt, you can communicate in order of registration at that location.

### Shanghai-Suzhou Carrier Wave Telephone Smooth

The Shanghai-Suzhou carrier wave telephone, since it was installed and tested last month, and officially opened on February 1, has been very convenient for the public because the tone wave has been raised and the sound wave is very clear. It has been discovered that this carrier wave mechanism is manufactured by the German Siemens factory and installed in the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, Zhabei Branch, and Suzhou Telegraph Bureau. It is of the MK type, specifically for short-distance long-distance open lines, such as 60 to 100 kilometers, and can transmit calls through a frequency of 80 to 140 kilocycles, which can increase the number of call return lines to as many as five on this pair of open lines. The mechanism is small, easy to install, and easy to adjust, so both economic and business aspects are beneficial. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications will also separately install corresponding carrier wave mechanisms on busy lines such as Beijing and Shanghai to make calls smooth and reduce waiting time.

The Jian'ou-Nanping telephone line in the Fujian region has been completed and opened for communication with six locations including Fuzhou on January 24. The call price is based on a three-minute system, with Jian'ou to Nanping at 3 corners, Shuikou at 5 corners, Fuzhou at 8 corners, Youxi at 5 corners, Gutian at 4 corners, and Minqing at 6 corners.

Spring and Autumn

### Scattered Strings of Spring

— Chengxuan

Don't waste this beautiful time! Although it is said that "there are many good days in spring and autumn," "autumn" is ultimately not as good as "spring"! In the quiet fields: flowers silently unfold their smiles: trees can no longer bear to burst forth with their tender buds, a myriad of purples and reds, the indescribable beauty! Deep blues and tender greens, an endless pattern; enjoy the moment! Go appreciate the beauty of nature! There is all the true knowledge, the true learning that you want to know! The ancients said: "Holding a candle for a night tour," is really "a good reason"!!

The proverb says: "One moment of a spring night is worth a thousand gold" Ah! "The passing of the years is like this, not giving up the whole night," one moment of spring night is like this, one moment of spring day should be multiplied by it! People in the urban life of "spring sleep not realizing the dawn"! You should think about how precious the spring day is!

The plan for the year lies in "spring" and "spring is the beginning of the year." At this time of deepening national crisis, how should we work hard and measure? How should we be as vibrant as "spring"!

"Spring does not become spring when it comes to a poor family," in these years, reading the poem of Yao Chunmu, there is really a pain that cannot be said! Poets are mostly idealists and seek the future. Such a faint realism, it was like this in the past, and it is no different now!

### Scholar

— Hua Binghe

Scholars are useless these days. It is certainly surprising that university students pull rickshaws, but it is not a good thing to be able to support themselves. It is terrible to still hold the idea that "a prime minister must be a scholar" in the late Qing Dynasty, and it actually produced many jokes.

When Zheng Xiaoxu was a border defense minister in western Guangdong, he was very proud of being a scholar in the military. However, at that time, bandits were rampant, and the people were almost unable to live. However, he thought he was successful and sang praises for thousands of years. He actually erected a monument and wrote poems, doing the work of self-praise. Therefore, he was impeached by Cen Chunxuan, the Governor-General of Liangguang, who scolded him as a painter of cakes and a famous scholar. It is pitiful that this border defense minister, who claimed to be a scholar in the military, originally wanted to be comparable to the story of Yanran Le Ming and Xianshan Fallen Tears, but ended up being ridiculed as a painter of cakes. Do you think it is pitiful or not?

The most interesting thing is that in the Middle East campaign, a Hunan governor named Wu was overjoyed to obtain an ancient seal of General Du Liao. He thought that this must be a sign of meritorious service in Liaodong and the ennoblement of Wanli, so he immediately wrote a memorial to the emperor, requesting to lead the army. Who knows that after arriving at the battlefield, he hung a death-免牌 in front of the camp, meaning that he wanted the enemy to disarm and surrender to avoid both sides being destroyed. On the one hand, he and several staff members wrote poetry and painted every day, but as a result, they were attacked by the enemy, causing the entire army to be annihilated and irretrievable. This scholar was really foolish.

Huang Zhongze has a poem saying: "A scholar is useless," This is such a painful thing.

### Snow in the Northeast

— Snow Essay

Ever since I was little, having been born in the North, I have had an unspeakable love for "snow," and I don't know why.

In the Northeast, during the winter, you won't have a moment when you can't see "snow," not because it's snowing all the time, but because the weather is cold, and "snow" won't melt.

I like it best when it snows at night. Then, when you look outside in the morning, your eyes are filled with bright, silvery white. Everything appears simple, natural, and harmonious, instantly making you feel as if you're in another world, washing away all the dust and vulgar thoughts in your heart.

If there are trees nearby, you will see layers of snow piled up on the bare branches, pure white and exceptionally lovely.

At this time, whenever the snow stops falling, I put on my leather clothes and happily go for a walk in the snow. Sometimes, high blocks of ice freeze onto my heels. My feet make a "creak-creak" sound, and I love to watch my footprints one by one in the snow.

Sometimes, driving the "sledge" unique to the Northeast, supporting myself on the snow to play, it is fast and light, rolling over the tracks in the snow, truly a unique and elegant experience.

If you have had your fill of playing outside, it is best to do some "snow sweeping." Pushing a wooden rake, piling the snow into heaps, then you will feel a sense of pleasure, and I guarantee you will break a sweat!

If you are in the mood, great! Let's build a "snowman"! A big-bellied Buddha, a Luohan, whatever you like. Once it's built, it will stay there obediently, unless the snow melts.

After it snows, the streets are covered in ice, and it becomes a place for children to play "sliding." Every evening in the dim twilight, the lively laughter and shouts of children echo from the doorways of every house!

Since embarking on my journey, it has been a long time since I have seen the "snow" of my hometown. However, I still admire it as much as I used to. When will I be able to go back and see its beautiful appearance? …

### In the Lantern Market

— Chen Damu

The New Year is lively. After the first five days have passed, and everyone has eaten "Wealth God Wine," this joyous abolished lunar new year seems to have come to an end. However, "lights up with glutinous rice balls, lights out with noodles", there is precedent for this. The Lantern Festival and the viewing of lanterns become an "extra" in a grand festival, which is indispensable. Otherwise, everyone feels deserted and unable to "disperse when the fun is over". The lighting of tall lanterns starts on the thirteenth day and ends on the eighteenth, and lasts six days including both ends. The drumming and firecrackers, the bright lanterns in every household, and the lively atmosphere surpass even the beginning of the New Year.

As a child, I was particularly excited about these days. When I saw the children in the neighborhood carrying watermelon lanterns and dragging rabbit lanterns, I felt envious and impatient, and quarreled with my parents incessantly. At first, my mother always refused my request: "Children don't know how hard it is to earn money. What's the use of buying those useless things!" At that time, I didn't understand these reasons, and I resented them in my heart, so angry that I refused to eat. Finally, my father agreed to take me to the lantern market in the City God Temple to pick one. What I loved the most was the crab lantern with eight legs and two pincers that could move, and the green-haired lion holding a ball lantern. But the price was very expensive, and I often couldn't make a deal even after visiting several stalls. In my heart, I only resented my father's stinginess. In the end, I only bought a cheap and unremarkable toad lantern and a lotus lantern, and I still didn't feel very happy.

But just like a dream, my childhood life has become a bubble. Although there are still occasional memories, there is no way to bring it back. And now I have become the father of two children. Only now do I understand the reason why my mother refused to buy me lanterns before, and I also understand my father's past distress in being stingy and unwilling to buy good lanterns. When I myself was forced by my children to go to the lantern market, and they吵着to buy good lanterns, I felt that the children were too noisy and did not consider the hardships of being an adult. Taking out a portion of the not-so-abundant living expenses to buy lanterns, a luxury item that cannot satisfy hunger or keep warm, is really a pity.

In the lantern market, with a troubled mood, my older son grabbed the corner of my right clothes, and my younger son grabbed the left side, squeezing from this stall to that stall. The lanterns were made more elaborate and exquisite year by year. The value is also directly proportional to the material. After more than two hours, I couldn't buy a satisfactory lantern, and I used all kinds of deceptive and insincere words to comfort the children: "Do you like this big revolving lantern? It's not as good as the Tangke car lantern, … But, be good, Dad thinks the airplane lantern is more fun. Do you know about saving the country through aviation and fighting the ×× devils." However, the children's patience was not as good as mine. They seemed to have seen through my deception, and it was not enough to maintain their confidence in me unless each of them was immediately bought a lantern. When I thought of my childhood memories and my aging parents, I couldn't help but lower my head to life. In this lively lantern market.

### The Phoenix Changes Its Nest

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Eleven (Whispered Gratitude Felt for the Mother’s Pavilion; Repentant Sentiment Shown for Filial Piety; Autumn Light Dims Emerald Green; The Landscape Evokes Poetic Thoughts)

Menglan said, "I have two paths now. One is death, and the other is to obey my parents' orders. The third is… that doesn't need to be discussed. Second sister-in-law, you know I believe in religion. Religion considers a person who commits suicide a sinner against heaven and earth. No matter what, I won't commit suicide. As for my parents' orders, alas, I really can't say…" Saying that, she shook her head several times. The second young mistress said, "Since these two paths are impassable, then you should take the third path. What exactly is this third path? You might as well tell me. We're just chatting anyway, what's the rush?" Menglan said, "Alas! The third path, does that even need to be asked? It's like I've completely surrendered, and I'll do everything according to what the elders want." The second young mistress got up again, poured a cup of tea, and sipped it slowly. While sipping the tea, her eyes shot from the rim of the cup to Menglan's face several times. After finishing the cup of tea, she put down the cup and smiled at her, "Younger sister is a new person, but she talks a lot about old morality." Menglan said, "I'm a new person?" Saying that, she smiled slightly. The second young mistress smiled and said, "What? Don't you admit that you're a new person?" Menglan said, "If I were a new person, I wouldn't be in this topsy-turvy situation now. Where do I look like a new person?" The second young mistress nodded and said, "Although I don't know many characters, I often hear your second brother say to me. Young people are born in this era, whether they are new or old. Only those whose thoughts are neither new nor old are the most troubled. Why? Because they already know that their thoughts need to be new, but even if they walk on the new road, their family and society will inevitably be out of sync with them. People don't like to listen to what they say. People don't like to see what they do. Even the books they read, people say they shouldn't be read. If they abandon the new and walk only on the old road, young people will be called old and corrupt, and they won't be willing to accept it in their hearts. This makes it so that neither the new nor the old is good, and neither is solid. Younger sister, do you think what I said is right?" Menglan smiled and said, "What you said is absolutely right. I didn't expect that a young mistress in the family would understand so much of the suffering of young people." The second young mistress smiled and said, "This is called learning as you get older. Your second brother likes to discuss these things, and I often listen by the side, so I understand a little. In fact, what I understand is what I say. What I haven't said, I probably don't understand. You say my knowledge isn't very limited, right?" (138)

Little Spring and Autumn

### Destiny

Destiny is empty. Unreliable.

Destiny is the deification of things that human intelligence cannot explain and understand.

People with diminished vitality wait for good luck.

Good luck does not fly to you when you wait quietly.

Good luck can only be obtained through constant effort.

### Old Opera Style in Patterns

— Zhang Huang

In old operas, whether it is dialogue, lyrics, acting, stage steps, stage setting, or costumes and makeup, everything has certain rules, certain connections, and a necessary expression at the appropriate time. Anyone who is slightly familiar with the situation of old operas can imagine it and can try to compile and control it without any inappropriateness. I admit that all of these—everything in old operas—conforms to the pattern style. Stereotyped, accurate, and responsive are all the spirit of old operas. It takes the actors many years of hard work and practice to hope to become famous actors. The depth of an actor's attainment, in addition to seeing whether he can conform to the established examples or procedures of the performing arts, also has differences in the talent of each individual. That is exactly like the creators of pattern paintings also have coarse or fine structures, and the sensitivity or clumsiness of individuals, which can be used for people to identify and criticize. Foreigners appreciate Chinese old operas originally from the starting point of aestheticism.

### Ink Monkey

— Chen Tianci

Everyone knows that Jilin in the three northeastern provinces has the three treasures of sable fur, ginseng, and Ula grass. However, there is another kind of living treasure in the pine forests of the three northeastern provinces, but it is not familiar to people, that is the ink monkey.

The ink monkey is only a little over three inches long, its fur is purple, its eyes are golden, and its tail is short. Each one is worth about five hundred gold. Those who get it mostly keep it in an ivory brush holder, locked with a very thin gold chain, and eat pine table pomegranate seeds. The ink monkey is named for ink because it is fond of fragrant ink, and it licks and eats it whenever there is excess ink left over from grinding ink for painting.

In the deep mountains of Taiwan, there is also a kind of small monkey, a little over four inches long, with red eyes and pure black fur. It also likes to eat ink, and it also likes to eat sugarcane, corn, and famous kinds of nuts. It is heard that this kind of monkey is produced in the mountain valleys near the sea in Right Bay. If a ship passes underneath, they gather to watch. However, they are extremely alert and clever, and they are agile and good at avoiding, so it is very difficult to get them, and they are rarely seen on the market.

### Poison Gas Was Invented in China

— He Laohe

Recently, I read Chief Censor Qi's Jixiao Xinshu and saw a section on the method of making a "sky-filling smoke spray tube." Examining its effect, it is no different from what is now called poison gas. I have specially transcribed the original text below to show that we also had it three hundred years ago: "Cut coarse bamboo one inch in diameter, and fasten it with cloth hoops. Use saltpeter, sulfur, arsenic, cantharides, river sand, alum, soap pods, copper green, Sichuan pepper, pinellia, swallow droppings, soot, lime, doulan grass, grass bird, polygonum hydropiper, and garlic. Divide the methods into degrees and measure the magnetic sand, Wangtian sand, and sand poison. Tie it to the end of a gun pole, ignite it in the direction of the wind, and it will cause tears, sneezing, difficulty breathing, and mouth shut…" (See Qi Jiguang's Jixiao Xinshu, Chapter Eighteen of the Governance of Water Soldiers.)

### Reminiscing About the People of the Past

— Ying

Archaeologists say: "The pyramids of Egypt are rare architectural structures; the astronomy of Babylon is a pity because it is not passed down now."

Politicians say: "Democratic republican politics were first realized in ancient Greece. That was true democratic republic."

Literary scholars say: "The Book of Songs is a wonderful book of folk literature; the writing style of the Spring and Autumn Annals is truly difficult to change even one word. To learn calligraphy, you still have to learn from the Han and Wei Dynasties."

Ordinary people say: "In the past, rice was only seven or eight yuan a stone, and eggs were four or five cash each. Those past days were really good."

### The Pottery Industry of Yixing

— Wu Baipeng

The pottery industry of Yixing, which has always enjoyed a great reputation, is regarded as a rare treasure by all those within and outside the country who love archaeology and are erudite. In recent years, the rise of pottery shops and the unimpeded sales of products are enough to prove that my writing is not fabricated.

The pottery clay originally comes from Shushan Town in my Yixing. According to legend, it was created by the Great Doctor Fan Li of Yue, who came to live in Lishu. Located in the southeast corner of the city, the purple clay produced has different luster, some red like fire, some gray and blue-yellow, which is not found in other towns, and only my Yixing produces it.

The products are mostly for daily use and display, such as teapots, teacups, flowerpots, water inkstones, reds, urns, bottles, jars, etc., with many patterns and a dazzling array of goods. In recent years, with the progress of industry, no matter people, birds, or animals, the soil color is distributed, closely resembling the shape of objects, lifelike and realistic, truly masterpieces.

The manufacturing method is roughly divided into five major categories: making blanks, repairing blanks, carving, applying oil, and applying color. However, they all rely on manual labor. Today, they still adhere to the old methods and have not yet seen perfection. In addition, the complexity of the manufacturing method and the slow delivery of goods are a major impact on production.

Recently, the government, in view of the desire to improve this industry, has specially set up a provincial pottery school near Shushan, specializing in cultivating talents and assisting in teaching. Although only a few years have passed in haste, the results have been remarkable, and we have to regard it as a good phenomenon for the revival of the pottery industry.

The oldest and most refined in pottery making is Wu Dingsheng. The shop is located on Zhongzheng Street in the city. The owner, Wu Hanwen, is nearly sixty years old, but he is full of energy. He usually eats vegetarian food and chants Buddhist scriptures. He is the king of the pottery industry in my Yixing. Others such as Yixing Wu Hanji Xingye are slightly inferior.

In short, in everything you do, you must have a little competitive spirit. This competition is not in lowering prices, but in the quality of materials. Try to observe the current situation. How many people can pay attention to materials? Most of them are eager to sell at low prices, and they don't care about the quality of materials or the processing of manufacturing. This is really heartbreaking.

Travel clothes newly removed, evening chill arises, the light footsteps of ladies on the long veranda, rising in the morning to roll up the screen just as she smiles, dressing table below the high and wide river.

Talking Point

### The Rise and Fall of Broadcasting

— Jia Qian

The prevalence of broadcasting in China is still a matter of the last three to five years. I remember that the first few broadcasting stations were all "amateur" in nature. That is, there was no limit to the frequency, and there were no various programs. They only broadcast records, and it seems that business advertisements were a later thing. However, even under these circumstances, listeners welcomed a new gadget. At that time, crystal sets and single-tube radios could be sold at very good prices. Due to the surge in radios, broadcasting stations increased programs and business advertisements. At the same time, the International Telecommunications Bureau also limited the frequency of broadcasting stations. That was the golden age of broadcasting. There were more than forty broadcasting stations in Shanghai alone. Every day from seven or eight o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the morning, the radio was never silent, and the import of radios also gave us an astonishing number.

However, since last year, this emerging industry has been affected by the downturn in various industries and has gradually declined. Also, because the members of the broadcasting staff are complex, and the Telecommunications Bureau has also limited ten kinds of programs that are not allowed to be broadcast between 6 pm and 10 pm, this has given a heavy blow to the broadcasting industry and broadcasting staff.

Recently, the Telecommunications Bureau has ordered eight broadcasting stations, including Tongle and Zhou Xieji, to stop broadcasting. "The stations have all stated that they were established in accordance with the regulations on private radio stations of the Ministry of Communications and submitted applications for permission. They are legal private enterprises and should be protected by the government according to law if they have not violated the regulations. On February 4, they stated their reasons and submitted another request to the ministry to withdraw its order and issue standards for the equipment of private radio stations. However, they have not been approved, so yesterday (the 27th) all private radio stations stopped broadcasting for one day and sent representatives to Beijing to petition."

The outcome of the petition, in the coming days I think there will be a follow up, now it is not necessary to speculate. However, according to what the author knows, the Ministry of Communications recently issued a notice to all broadcasting stations regarding the allocation of programs, 60% for education and 40% for entertainment. It is naturally a gratifying phenomenon to use pure entertainment broadcasting to assist education. The report of the Trade Bureau puts the number of radio imports in the same column as cosmetics and other consumables. Even if the pure entertainment broadcasting industry returns to its former heyday, I am afraid it will feel ashamed.

In Europe, America, and Japan, the most prominent is the Soviet Union, broadcasting stations are not only a powerful tool for promoting education and academics, but also an important tool in the military. And we spend countless amounts of money on "private engagement in the back garden" and "capturing Zhang Sanlang alive" voices, naturally there is a need for rectification, and starting to increase educational programs first is also very correct. However, we also have to look at the target of purchasing radios from another perspective. Will they abandon the erhu and pipa and take classes by the radio like elementary school students? Even if the broadcasting stations broadcast 100% educational programs, I am afraid that these more than 100,000 radios will be put on a high shelf, and they will flock to the Oriental Bookstore.

Listeners purchase radios mainly for entertainment programs. We should start from "integrating education with entertainment." Whether it is comedy, storytelling, or any entertainment program, we should rope them with goals. Now, all kinds of entertainment program scripts have to be reviewed by the Social Affairs Bureau before they are allowed to be broadcast. Starting from here, perhaps we can "achieve twice the result with half the effort." This is a bit of a humble opinion that the author offers. In China, it is too early to use broadcasting to "popularize education" no matter what.

### On the Open Field

— Lyon

People who seek life in the city want to breathe a little fresh air, just like looking for a pool of water in the desert. When I first discovered this new home, I felt so relieved. Although this dilapidated floor looked somewhat like an ancient temple that had been in disrepair for years, with rotten rafters and mottled powder brick walls, it often gave people unpleasantness. What I loved, however, were the four bright tile windows facing south and the open field outside the window. A jujube tree stood next to the building, tall and beautiful. Its sturdy branches stretched straight up to the window. In the summer, when the leaves were lush, it made a natural curtain for the small building. In the morning, the little sparrows drummed their reed-like tongues on the branches and sang beautiful songs. So I jumped out of bed to enjoy the regulation of plant oxygen. When the autumn wind rose, I could pick jujubes to eat by slightly reaching out at the window of the building. Although this open field and jujube tree were not my ancestral property, I have unconditionally become their temporary owner.

How fortunate a enjoyer I was, a traveler in the desert found a sweet spring.

However, there were days of suffering. Winter and spring were the coming of these days. Except for rainy and snowy days, the winter sun was particularly good on this open field. Precisely because the sun was good, it attracted some old women, mothers, and children from the nearby low houses. They came to enjoy the warmth given by nature. Even the workers in the rope-making field moved the heavy wooden frames to the open field to twist ropes. The unrestrained wildness and fighting of the children, the intentional or unintentional teasing of the workers and mothers, the old women's mumbling rebukes, a kind of noisy and chaos, disturbed my thoughts. Closing the window was useless. Trying to put pen to paper, I would often be hit by a burst of laughter or a noisy scolding. Sometimes I was really annoyed by the noise. I left my chair and desk, preparing to push open the window to issue a warning or reprimand to the crowd on the open field, but I immediately dismissed this idea. What qualifications did I have to interfere with their freedom to enjoy life? And how could I prohibit the expression of the public's nature for my own sake of seeking tranquility?

So I sat down patiently again, throwing away my anger, and admonishing myself: I should temper myself to become a public and sacrifice personal enjoyment.

A winter was tempered in this way. The open field in the new spring was even more lively. Every day there was a burst that made my heart shake. In the sounds of these crude instruments, it seemed to be filled with the call of life: "Hey, do you want money or life? Hey, do you want money or life!" Several times, I really felt frightened and covered my ears. In this day and age, are there really people who risk their lives to earn a living? As soon as this doubt surfaced in my mind, reason immediately gave an answer from the side: How could there not be, and there are many more. If you are willing to carefully investigate the society, isn't it staging the heartbreaking tragedy of life of "wanting money and not life" everywhere! I immediately understood: From the open field outside the window, you can see the prototype of the entire society.

Today, people who do monkey shows came to the open field again. In addition to the main character, the monkey, there was also a sheep and a mutt. I was also a member of the audience. At first, the monkey, sheep, and mutt were all tied to the jujube tree trunk. This jujube tree that regulated my living environment unexpectedly became their shackles at this moment. The monkey show people opened the wooden box and took out many clothes and face masks. With a whip in one hand, the monkey, under the direction of the whip, put on clothes and face masks, rode on the sheep's back, and pretended to be human to do tricks. Finally, it was the mutt's turn, kneeling to the audience to beg. Then the person shouted: "Give money, give money!" How could animals do tricks willingly? They were nothing more than being forced by the whip.

There was no way. The most pitiful was still the tame sheep, which became the slave of a slave.

From then on, I had a deeper understanding of the open field outside the bright tile window.

### A Realistic Tragedy

— Nan'ou

Just as dawn was breaking, workers in the mining area began to get up from their residences. They coughed, casually spat, and indistinct voices carried outside. The weather had been rather strange lately, mostly rain. The soil was all wet and loose. Old worker Shen Gui looked at the continuous rain and muttered:

"The natural order has changed! I've been here for fifteen years and never encountered weather like this!"

"It doesn't rain much in Nanyang – this is truly strange!" Another person, hearing Shen Gui's words, casually responded.

Today, Shen Gui got up, and the first thing he did was stick his head out of the small window to look at the sky, trying to determine if the sun would come out. It was hard to say for sure, but he was certain it would be clear. The roof of the house across the way was still damp, and water droplets were still dripping from the eaves. At this moment, the young Gu A'er got up and ran out. Shen Gui, seeing his bare back, said to him with envy:

"A'er, you really are an ox! Going out shirtless so early in the morning, aren't you afraid of getting sick?"

"Good morning, Uncle Shen Gui!" A'er replied with a smile: "We laborers aren't afraid of the cold." Then, he turned back into the house. A'er's wife was taking out clothes she had washed very clean for him. She and A'er had only been married for five years, and their son was almost two years old. This young couple was often envied in the mining area. Now, A'er was going to work as usual. He put on his hat, picked up a lamp for use in the mine, glanced at his still sleeping child, and went out.

On the way to the mine, Gu A'er walked together with Shen Gui and the others through the gray morning mist. The experienced Shen Gui mentioned to people that the mine wasn't as solid as usual due to the excessive rain and that if they weren't careful, they might… He didn't finish the sentence. A'er patted him on the shoulder, saying that Shen Gui was worrying too much: why think of misfortune all the time?

And so, A'er happily worked in the mine. The foreman patrolled around, scolding people, which made the air in the mine unusually oppressive. There were also carts carrying stones rumbling past, heading outside. From the entrance of the mine to where A'er worked was almost half a mile long. Here, there wasn't a ray of sunlight. People breathed in the smell of dirt, and their bodies were covered in filth. The iron picks struck the stone, making a dinging sound. Without the lamps, this would be a truly dark world.

Work proceeded as usual… Someone was singing a Hakka mountain song, and there was laughter… Everyone seemed to be without a care…

But suddenly, with a bang—a sound like a thunderclap—the noise shook the workers' hearts in the mine. In an instant, the light from above was completely blocked, and piles of dirt fell down one after another. People immediately cried out. Shen Gui's shout was especially shrill:

"Oh no! The mine is collapsing!"

"Help! He-elp!" Some people, crushed by crossbeams, were shouting for help, but the falling rocks, wooden beams, and dirt were burying everyone.

Children and women from the residential area ran over, completely frantic. The mine police were busy maintaining order. The mine owner, chewing on a cheroot, looked like his eyes were about to burst into flames, sending out telegrams for help. And the secretary beside him was cursing in his heart: "A life-despising bastard! Didn't the engineer say five days ago to find a way to protect the workers' lives, that the mine wasn't very stable? Now… It's too late! Too late!"

The sun, as if surprised by such a tragedy in the human world, stuck its head out. And those who weren't afraid of the scorching equatorial sun waited together: in the mine, their fathers, husbands, or friends were trapped. What could they do to save those being buried alive underground?

By noon the next day, the rescue operation was considered to be over. When Shen Gui was pulled out of the ground, he had already been dead for more than half an hour. And Gu A'er, this strong, young fellow, had at least survived with his life, sent to the hospital for treatment. It was said that this time, more than sixty people had lost their lives: the number of injured was countless.

Such tragedies have happened more than once in the tin mines of the Malay Peninsula! However, this was a particularly terrible one! That year, I lived in ×× port, not far from the mining area. Hearing about the lack of protection for the lives of workers, I was deeply angered, and still am to this day…

### Stealing a Horse

— Liu Ming

—One of the Northeast Stories—

All of you are in the South and rarely have the opportunity to ride horses. In fact, riding a horse is the most interesting thing. This year, I saw a donkey track on Yuyuan Road in Shanghai. The people riding the donkeys were wearing Western suits, and the donkeys were not much bigger than pigs. It didn't look right at all. Once you get to the North, you'll know how magnificent and interesting it is to ride a horse.

There was a time when I was a messenger in the brigade. Sometimes, when there was urgent official business, I had to run to a place 250 li away in a day and return the same night. In that case, only a good horse could handle it.

I don't know how much effort I put into finding a good horse. The brigade leader once lent me his favorite chestnut horse, but that animal lacked stamina. At first, it ran like crazy, but then it slowed down to a stroll. Even if I whipped it, it wouldn't move.

Later, I learned that the village chief in the neighboring village had a good horse. I had seen this horse before. It was tall, with a long nose and a tight belly. It was really a good one. From then on, I tried everything I could to get my hands on it.

One day, it was snowing lightly. The brothers treated me to a couple of cups of baijiu. As we talked, we started talking about horses again. I suddenly remembered the village chief's horse. I didn't want to, but it was strange, that night, I couldn't wait to steal it. I thought and thought, and decided to steal it tonight when there was no moon.

I borrowed a pistol and two pairs of rubber overshoes from the captain. These were all spoils of war from the Yilan area last year. I drank two more cups of wine to embolden myself, and then I got up, no matter what.

Once I got outside the town, the wind was whipping the snow, and the pine forest was howling wildly. I was hot and anxious. I whipped my horse a few times and ran straight to the neighboring village.

I tied the horse to a tree near the village. I quietly crossed the brick wall of the village chief's house. The wall was only about two feet high, enough to stop livestock, but not people. I quietly opened the wicker gate. The sky was pitch black. The fence was hissing in the wind. Even if I made a sound opening the gate, no one would hear it. I used my hands to lift the wooden door of the stable, and it immediately came off its hinges. The horse had already fallen asleep. I sprayed baijiu into its nose and mouth again and again, and quietly put the rubber overshoes on the horse's feet. Look, I was doing it so carefully, as if I had been stealing horses for five generations.

I led it out. After passing through the shed door, there was still no sound. As soon as I got outside the town, I took off the rubber overshoes. Some wild dogs barked like crazy, but no one heard it.

I was really happy as could be. I returned to the pine forest, untied the original horse, and then ran towards the town. I used the horse for two full years. I don't know who rides it now.

### Readers' Letters Regarding the "Abyssinia" Incident (Twenty-one Letters)

Editor:

We read with great enthusiasm the declaration of 122 people from the Shanghai literary, artistic, film, drama, and music circles against the sailors' atrocities.

This time, Italian sailors used violence to smash the Shanghai Grand Theater, injure dozens of our compatriots, and burn the "Abyssinia" film, which was passionately loved by our oppressed nation—this incident of insulting our nation and country can be said to have set a new record for the powerful interfering with the weak. They not only despised our government's sovereignty in supervising films but also destroyed our local legal and police authority. They simply treat the Chinese people as tame slaves!

Therefore, we believe that the Shanghai literary and artistic circles, etc., put forward in the declaration: urging the government to demand compensation for losses from Italy, punish the murderers, apologize, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future, etc., and believe that it is sufficient to represent the public opinion of all of us. Whether we stand in the position of moviegoers or patriotic compatriots, we are willing to unite as a strong backing for the government's tough diplomatic negotiations.

However, we sincerely hope that people across the country will unite and not turn a blind eye, especially the press, which is responsible for promoting public opinion, should do its best for the future of this negotiation!

Sincerely hope that you can publish the letter.

Readers: Ye Hengrong, Jin Xichu, Xu Bingnan, Huang Xiaobai, Xu Jie, Guo Mingjin, Xu Mengqiu, Wang Zhijia, Zhang Dingsui, Mo Zhuan, Zhang Jing, Zhou Chenghun, Zhang Renwei, Xu Peizhong, Wan Ming, Chen Xingzhou, Bao Zhigang, Fan Pingye, Cai Taosheng, Qi Tianran

Editor's Note: The last signatory of the twenty-one readers' letters was not included because the signature was unclear. We hope to be notified and will add it later.

### Hua'an Broadcasting

The entire film "Daughter of the General" has been filmed and is now being edited intensively.

"Pearls Left in the Sea of People" is Zhu Shilin's new film, which has been largely completed, with only a few scattered shots remaining. The ballroom scene is set in Lido, accommodating 400 pairs of dancers.

In "Pearls Left in the Sea of People," Li Lili performs the rattle drum dance. Lili is very proficient in various dance techniques. This rattle drum dance is newly learned, taught by a famous Western dancer in Shanghai, and the dance posture is graceful and light.

In "Pearls Left in the Sea of People," Yin Xiucen and Han Langen are a pair of "double acts." The two of them get together to eat tofu in the ballroom, inventing a new tofu dance with novel postures.

"Kirin Music House" is an artistic epic directed by Zhou Yihua. Zhou is proficient in old operas and loves film art. He laments that the excellent melodies of our national operas have become Guanglingsan (lost classics); this time, he vows to preserve the essence of old operas and cooperate with Zhou Xinfang to pass on a generation of artists.

"Kirin Music House" is based on Zhou Xinfang's signature masterpieces and selects those that contain inspiring patriotic ideas for filming, which can both preserve the authenticity of the opera and achieve the effect of guidance.

Cai Chusheng's new work "Wang Laowu" has been approved by Nanjing and has begun filming.

"Wang Laowu" is about a mediocre and ignorant person who suffers all kinds of life pressures, unable to laugh or cry, a pitiful insect who sacrifices himself meaninglessly in a turbulent period.

Chen Yanyan has recently received an increasing number of letters from fans, which she cannot answer in time. A "Chen Fan" lady who came from Changsha at a great distance, upon meeting Chen, burst into tears with joy and described her four hundred unanswered letters to Chen and the suffering of her day and night unrequited love, which can be said to be the greatest miracle under heaven.

Li Lili loves music the most and plays the piano well. She still runs to the home of an old Western woman every day, diligently seeking to improve herself.

Yin Xiucen dreamed of the Spring Festival and continued to sleep for three days and nights, not participating in dancing or gambling, and gained another ten pounds.

"Kirin Music House" needs to borrow the entire set of large incense tables from Hong Jingling's house. Hong burned incense and prayed repeatedly before daring to move them, fearing offending his family's "Second Lord."

### Minxin News

"The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" has been shown in Peiping and Tientsin, and business is excellent. The Zhengguang and Liangyuan theaters of the Suzhou YMCA showed it simultaneously. According to a special letter from the theater authorities, it has been sold out for days. Guangzhou will be showing it soon, and the Shanghai run is not far away, and it will undoubtedly be welcomed by the audience. The film has a very realistic story, a tortuous and moving performance, and a novel style, all of which are rare in domestic films.

In the past, Li Keng's talent was discovered while filming "Humanity," and he jumped to become a shining child star in the Chinese film scene. Now, Minxin is filming "New Humanity" and has discovered Li Keng's younger brother, Li Xi, who is also a rare talented child star. Although only five years old, he not only understands acting very well and is as good as one could hope, but he also does not throw tantrums and does not interfere with work, which makes Minxin colleagues especially surprised. After the premiere of "New Humanity," the society's surprise and joy at the emergence of this little star is the same as when Li Keng was discovered.

In "New Humanity," Liang Saizhu not only broke her previous achievements in acting, but also made every effort to make her makeup and clothing gorgeous, and will definitely give the audience a new impression in the future.

Ren Pengnian's "Mysterious Female Detective" is progressing very smoothly, because the preparation period was very long, so since the start of work, most of the time is spent filming. According to accurate estimates, about half has been completed.

Currently, Zhong Shigen is working hard on adding subtitles to a portion of the film "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" for comparison. These copies will be specially prepared for screening in special areas where Mandarin is not very common.

### The Atrocities of Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry

Remember when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, there were slogans everywhere calling for the overthrow of local tyrants and evil gentry. Indeed, local tyrants and evil gentry are too hateful! Tianyi's film "Yangliu Village" fully exposes the atrocities of local tyrants and evil gentry.

"Yangliu Village" is directed by Gao Lihen and has been filmed and is awaiting release.

### Yu Guang Embezzles Public Funds

When the dancer Zhu Qiuhen and the bank clerk Yu Guang were holding their wedding, several detectives came to the hall and arrested Yu Guang for embezzling public funds. This bolt from the blue knocked Zhu Qiuhen to the ground. Fortunately, the two dancers Lu Ming and Yan Yuexian, who lived with her day and night, slowly woke her up. Zhu Qiuhen's tears flowed like a tide. She was heartbroken, constantly shouting madly, "Marriage, marriage, this is marriage!"

This is a sad event in "Elastic Daughter."
