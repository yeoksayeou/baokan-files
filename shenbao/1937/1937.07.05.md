### The Life of the Miao People in Eastern Yunnan

— Geng Ya

Yunnan is known for its complex variety of ethnic groups. They can be broadly divided into six major groups: Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Miao, and Yi. Although there is also the term "untamed Yi," they are nothing more than variations of the above six groups. The Han and Hui cultures are relatively advanced, while the Mongolian, Tibetan, Miao, and Yi peoples mostly live in remote areas, and their lifestyles are largely uncivilized. Among them, the Miao and Yi groups have the most branches. Historians refer to them as the Cochin-China ethnic group, with a broad and distant origin. The Ai Lao, Ju Ding, Gu Xi, and other Yi peoples of the Han dynasty; the Bo Man of the Jin and Southern and Northern dynasties; the Nanzhao Bo Man of successive dynasties; and the Thirty-Seven Tribes of the Song and Yuan dynasties; and the Shangsi tribal chiefs of the Ming and Qing dynasties were all ancestors of the Miao and Yi peoples. The Miao population is very large. Most of them migrated south from the Central Plains and spread to various places, including the border areas of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. The Miao Mountains and Weining area of Guizhou are their main gathering places. Eastern Yunnan is very close to this area, so it is also an area where they live and multiply. According to the "Qian Miao Tu Shuo," their ethnic distinctions number more than eighty, but most are named by the Han people based on their locations, such as Caijia Miao and Songjia Miao, which are named after surnames. Others, such as Bazhai Miao, Gaopo Miao, and Xixi Miao, are named after regions. Still others, such as Qing Miao, Hua Miao, Bai Miao, Hei Miao, Dujiao Miao (i.e., Juxie Miao), and Duanqun Miao, are named after their attire. The Miao people commonly seen in the Xuanwei area of Eastern Yunnan are only of the Duanqun (short skirt) type. According to their own accounts, their ancestors originally lived in Ze'an Prefecture, Jiangxi during the Song dynasty. At the beginning of the Qing dynasty, they initially circled Hunan and Guizhou, and during the Kangxi era, they were driven into the Eastern Yunnan area.

The Miao people are straightforward and simple, conservative, hardworking, and good at hunting, with every shot hitting its mark. They usually enjoy singing, dancing, and playing the reed pipe (a musical instrument) for entertainment. Their clothing is mostly made of self-woven hemp cloth, sewn with coarse needles and large threads. Usually, both men and women wear straw sandals and go barefoot, with cloth wrapped around their legs (commonly called "rolled leg wraps"), and wide belts around their waists. Women wrap their heads with blue and red cloth, wear short skirts, and do not wear trousers. Their clothes are also embroidered with patterns. Their lives are relatively hard. They live in poor mountainous valleys, making a living by farming (mostly tenant farming) and animal husbandry. Because of their hard work, they can barely support themselves. All the clothes and shoes they wear, as well as household items and farm tools, are made by their own families. Their food is very crude, consisting of things like corn, potatoes, ferns, buckwheat, and wheat. During their free time from farming, the men go into the mountains to hunt or go to the homes of people holding weddings and funerals to play the suona (commonly called "sala"), carry sedan chairs, and handle ceremonial duties. The women spin hemp and weave cloth at home or work as female helpers in the cities.

The Miao people are superstitious and believe in polytheism. They most worship spirit tablets, saying they are the spiritual objects of their ancestors. Next is the tree god. Every village must worship a large tree, saying it can control the good or bad fortune of travel and the gains or losses of hunting in the dark. Others include the gate god, which can prevent tigers from entering, and the big ear god, which can control epidemics. In the Shimenkan area of Zhaotong, however, most have been anesthetized by outsiders, leading them to overthrow the spirit tablets and worship Jesus instead.

The Miao people had written language in ancient times, but it was lost over time. The scriptures currently used are written in Chinese characters transliterated from the Miao language. The grammatical structure is very similar to Chinese, but the language structure is similar to that of the border Yi tribes, and the tones are similar to those of the Han people. However, there are also sounds that cannot be written in Chinese characters.

The Miao people can live peacefully and without conflict with other ethnic groups when they live together. However, they mostly depend on the feudal power of local chieftains or Yi chieftains and have an obligation to pay taxes every year. Each village also has a village chief who is responsible for mediating disputes. Some also organize Miao militias to implement self-defense. Even if major events occur in the tribe or village, they often resolve them on their own.

Regarding weddings and funerals, when a man and a woman are in love and the wedding date arrives, the groom simply carries a beautiful umbrella and walks to the bride's home to perform a greeting ceremony. He then acts as a guide, leading the bride back. Then, a banquet is held to entertain relatives and friends, and reed pipes are played, dances are performed, and people sing and drink. After death, they firmly believe that the person becomes a ghost after seven days and must endure the punishments of the twelve halls of the underworld. Therefore, a shaman is invited to beat the gong loudly to redeem the deceased's sins. In the past, the burial method was to bury the coffin horizontally rather than vertically. Now, due to close contact with the Han people and the passage of time, most have changed their ancient customs and adopted Han customs.

Since they worship polytheism and have no written history to record events, the popular myths and stories, such as "the creation of the universe," "the origin of the Miao people," and "not riding horses or sitting in sedan chairs," are numerous and unfounded. However, some lyrics are very interesting. I have selected a few easy-to-understand ones to serve as a humorous ending to this article:

㊀ Eat an olive and climb a slope. The sweet aftertaste of the olive makes me think of my dear brother. Picking firewood is not as safe as sitting on the back of an ox. The shepherd's voice sings of peace.

㊁ The moon comes out shining brightly. A needle is lost on the grass. The brother wants me for this needle. The sister wants to follow this brother for this affection.

㊂ Clear-headed apricot blossoms by the ditch. You tease me, and I tease him. If you want to tease him, abandon me. If you want to tease me, abandon him.

㊃ I see a green-tiled house across the river. Copper-clad pillars and iron-clad doors. Even if my parents are strict, (meaning the discipline is too strict) I will steal the sky and change the sun.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Future of the Non-Intervention Plan in the Spanish Civil War

— Fu

Since its establishment at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the International Non-Intervention Committee in London has implemented many non-intervention measures, such as banning the shipment of arms and volunteers to Spain and implementing maritime and land surveillance plans. From the perspective of international justice, this non-intervention approach has been very unfavorable to the legitimate government of Spain. However, in terms of preventing the expansion of the war, it has been quite effective. But now, this non-intervention plan has reached the point of imminent failure.

The failure to thoroughly implement the non-intervention plan is, of course, due to the sabotage by Germany and Italy. We will temporarily not dwell on distant facts and only use recent facts to illustrate. After the "Deutschland" incident at the end of May, Germany immediately carried out barbaric acts of revenge. At the same time, it took the opportunity to demand that Britain and France conclude a four-power agreement. After the establishment of the four-power agreement, Germany further manufactured the "Leipzig" incident, demanding that Britain and France jointly send warships to conduct joint demonstrations at Spanish government military ports in order to realize its ambition to attack the Spanish government. However, this intention was seen through by the British and French governments, so they rejected the German proposal. Germany, in its anger, announced its withdrawal from the maritime surveillance plan. Italy followed suit and took the same action. While Germany and Italy withdrew from the maritime surveillance plan, they did not withdraw the warships they had already dispatched. Instead, they used the excuse of protecting German and Italian interests to send a large number of warships to the waters belonging to the Spanish government forces. The intention behind this is very clear to anyone.

Later, Britain and France, unwilling to see their painstakingly planned maritime surveillance plan fail, decided to send warships to replace the tasks previously performed by Germany and Italy. At the same time, they invited Germany and Italy to send observers to monitor the ships. This attitude was quite reasonable, but Germany and Italy not only rejected the British and French suggestions, but also submitted a proposal to the Non-Intervention Committee on July 2, arguing: ㊀ The maritime surveillance system has already failed and there is no need to implement it again. However, the land surveillance plan should still be maintained. ㊀ Recognize the Spanish Nationalist forces as a belligerent party, granting them the rights that a belligerent party should enjoy. However, this proposal was firmly rejected by Britain, France, and other countries.

Why did Germany and Italy propose such a proposal, and why did Britain, France, and other countries firmly reject it? This is because if all countries recognize the Nationalist forces as a belligerent party, they can enjoy the rights of a belligerent party. The so-called rights of a belligerent party, in the current stage of the Spanish Civil War, primarily mean that the Nationalist forces' warships can blockade the ports of the Spanish government forces and arbitrarily search the merchant ships of various countries at sea. (Currently, if Nationalist forces' warships search the merchant ships of various countries, it is considered an act of piracy according to international law.) Originally, the Nationalist forces' warships did not have sufficient strength to carry out a naval blockade. Because, according to international law, a blockade is not valid if it is not effective. However, the Nationalist forces are backed by fascist countries. As long as all countries recognize them as a belligerent party, the warships of Germany and Italy can help the Nationalist forces blockade the ports of the Spanish government forces and attack the warships of the Spanish government. The reason why Germany and Italy proposed to abandon the maritime surveillance plan and recognize both sides as belligerent parties, while at the same time maintaining the land surveillance plan, actually contains such an extremely vicious intention. If this proposal is implemented, it will not only be a fatal blow to the Spanish government, but also greatly hinder Britain and France's lifeline in the Mediterranean and their commercial interests. The reason why Britain and France firmly rejected the German and Italian proposal is also because of this.

The final resolution of this issue is still pending the results of diplomatic negotiations between the various countries. However, the future of the non-intervention plan already looks very bleak. Because Hitler and Mussolini have both recently made it clear that the Nationalist forces must win the final victory. And to enable the Nationalist forces to win the final victory, Germany and Italy must implement even more aggressive intervention measures.

### New Interest Arises Between China and the United States

Kong Xiangxi to Visit Roosevelt Again, Preparing to Negotiate Reciprocal Trade Agreement

[Washington] Officials here today commented on the important results of Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's trip to the United States, saying that Kong's visit has generated new interest in issues and interests between China and the United States, and has made the United States fully aware of China's progress in recent years. Although the opinions exchanged between Kong and American officials on financial issues were not limited to a specific scope, they were also very beneficial. Next week, Kong will continue to talk with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, probably to promote the friendship between the two countries and not to discuss any specific plans. It is reported that Kong's talks with officials from the Treasury Department, such as Ze Changmao and Gen Taotao, were the most practical, but most of them were also on monetary issues. Kong expressed his desire to promote Sino-American commerce and investment by the Export-Import Bank, such as the Chinese order for locomotives after the bank's president, You Hua, invested. Kong did not specify what China needs to purchase, but he knew there were many types. Financial experts believe that China does not need foreign debt, so it should not directly seek assistance from the US government, and government agencies cannot provide any other assistance except for the purchase of gold and silver by the stabilization fund or investment by the Export-Import Bank. When Kong talks with Hull next week, they may discuss the issue of establishing a reciprocal treaty between China and the United States, but Kong also said that if formal negotiations on this treaty are held, it will be the responsibility of Wang Zhengting, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States.

### Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Discusses Domestic and Foreign Affairs

Balancing National Defense and People's Livelihood, Gradually Implementing Innovation

⊙Kamakura Prime Minister Konoe, for the purpose of weekend rest, departed from Tokyo for Kamakura villa at 10:00 am on the 3rd. He met with a group of reporters at the villa that evening and made the following remarks on current issues:

㊀Regarding diplomacy with the Soviet Union, the Ganquezi incident has temporarily subsided due to the withdrawal of troops by the Soviet side. However, if we take this opportunity to fundamentally adjust relations with the Soviet Union, it may still be extremely difficult. The occurrence of such an unfortunate incident, even from the perspective of prevention, makes it extremely necessary to determine the Manchu-Soviet border. However, regarding future policies, there is no pre-determined plan to convene a so-called four-province conference.

㊀Regarding the defects of the cabinet system, it has been a month since I took office. The current cabinet system is quite disorganized when cabinet members discuss fundamental issues or discuss the country's overall direction from a broad perspective. The ministers are indeed busy with the affairs of their respective provinces, and this method offers no better solution than dealing with the current issues from a practical standpoint.

㊂Regarding the intention to implement innovative policies, I believe that things should not be delayed when encountering problems. Regardless of the number of issues, we should first conclude the major ones and then handle them in order. For example, reforming the House of Peers and revising the entire parliamentary system are one such example. Others, such as reforming the overall education system, are also major issues.

㊃Regarding the reform of the parliamentary system, the reform of the parliamentary system undoubtedly faces various difficulties, but we must first start by reforming the House of Peers. As for the reform of the House of Peers, we plan to propose an outline at the general assembly on the 6th regarding reducing the number of noble members or changing the appointed members to a term system so that there can be a free discussion. It is said that the atmosphere in the House of Peers is that all factions support reform. As for the reform situation handled by the Guardian Cabinet in 1924, it is better to forget about it. Mr. Machang also has this view, meaning that if we don't do it, we don't do it, and if we want to do it, we must carry out reforms that have a considerable effect.

㊄Regarding the revision of the election system, in the end, this issue boils down to the voting method and the electoral district. I believe that the Imperial Diet has historically had too much discussion of local issues. After all, the dignified National Assembly should deliberate on the affairs of the entire country. It is necessary to correct this. Therefore, after revising the electoral district, we should also revise the local system and local finances, as well as the entire administrative structure.

㊅Regarding the reform of the education system, we will establish an investigation committee recently. However, I hope that this matter will be handled successively regardless of whether the cabinet changes. As for the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee, we plan to appoint people who are not related to the cabinet.

㊆Regarding the compilation of the next year's budget, the compilation of next year's budget will face considerable difficulties, but the military expenditure should not be forced to be perfunctory and seems to be able to be handled properly. Today's Japan has to place its focus on national defense expenditure, and at the same time, the government should do its best to stabilize the lives of the people. It is not intended to make the lives of the people a sacrifice to enrich national defense. Today, the domestic and foreign situation of our country is not yet the time to force the people to endure hardship. (4th Allied Telegram)

### Roosevelt Studies Limiting the Air Force

Banning Bombing of Civilian Areas, Difficult for All Countries to Agree

[Washington] Officials recently confirmed that President Roosevelt is studying a plan for air disarmament, intending to conclude an international agreement on the bombing of ordinary people's residential areas by aircraft. A State Department spokesperson declared that there is currently no concrete plan for air disarmament. According to the current environment, the US government is unwilling to make any proposals for disarmament or the economy unless it is confident of success. Semi-official personnel declared that the League of Nations had previously drafted treaty provisions regarding the prohibition of bombing non-military zones by aircraft. President Roosevelt's current plan is based on these provisions, but in a different form. It stipulates that the existing bomber aircraft of various countries do not need to be destroyed, but only need to have their internal military equipment removed. Semi-official personnel also believe that this plan was proposed by US special envoy Davis after he returned from Europe. According to Davis, when he was in Europe, the capital of Spain, Madrid, and the Basque capital, Guernica, were successively bombed by aircraft, and the cities were reduced to ruins. From this, we can see the great destructive power of modern aircraft. American people were shocked and sought ways to limit the effectiveness of aircraft bombing. This is why President Roosevelt is studying the air disarmament plan. However, well-informed sources admit that if this plan is proposed, it will inevitably cause objections from various countries. For example, before the northwest region of India is pacified, the United Kingdom may not be willing to be restricted regarding the bombing of ordinary people's residential areas by aircraft. France will probably argue that air disarmament is impossible before land and naval armaments are restricted. As for Italy, which is currently expanding its air force on a large scale, it will probably also object to the proposal to restrict the bombing of cities. (Central 3rd Havas)

### Italian Lira Not to Be Devalued With the French Franc

[Rome] The semi-official Italian newspaper Corriere d'Italia recently published an article, stating that the renewed devaluation of the French franc is an internal event in France. Since the Italian lira has no connection with the French franc, it will not be devalued with it. (Central News Agency 3rd Havas Telegram)

### Search for Missing Female Aviator by Warships and Airplanes Proves Fruitless; Hopes for Survival Dim

Pacific Ocean Storms Have Passed, Sea Surface Calm. Three Thousand Square Miles North of Howland Island Searched Without Trace. Husband Believes She May Have Landed on a Small Island.

⊙Honolulu: A report was recently received from the cruiser Itasca stating that the ship had searched approximately three thousand square miles north of Howland Island but found no trace of Ms. Earhart. The storms in the nearby sea have now passed, and the sea is particularly calm, with improved visibility. (National Telegram, 3rd)

⊙Honolulu: American female aviator Ms. Earhart and her navigator, Noonan, were forced to land in the Pacific Ocean yesterday and have not been heard from since. Because of the storms in the Pacific Ocean, hopes for their survival are slim. Yesterday, a naval aircraft dispatched from here to assist in the search of Howland Island encountered storms about five hundred miles from the island and has since returned. Currently, only the cruiser Itasca is near Howland Island, and even if there is an opportunity, it will be difficult to provide assistance. Naval authorities were also concerned yesterday that the returning aircraft might run out of fuel en route, so they dispatched four warships to meet it. Today, the authorities dispatched two more warships to Howland Island to assist in the search, but given the slow speed of warships, it is feared that it will be in vain. The USS Colorado also has three aircraft on board, which will be dispatched for search as soon as it reaches the vicinity of the island. The only hope now is the distress telegram received by the police and amateur radio stations, but experts are skeptical because the signal is weak and may be a "harmony" generated by a local radio station. Ms. Earhart's husband, Putnam, asked a Honolulu radio station tonight to broadcast every hour throughout the night, asking Ms. Earhart to reply with "Land" if on land, "Sea" if at sea, "South" if south of the equator, and "North" if north of the equator. The tax police ordered the cruiser Itasca not to interfere during each broadcast. Putnam is currently in California with Crum. He believes there are many islands in the South Sea, and Ms. Earhart has landed on an island. The manufacturer of the aircraft used by Ms. Earhart also stated that if the fuel tank is empty and the sea is calm, the aircraft will not sink. (National Telegram, 3rd)

[San Francisco] After the famous American female aviator Earhart went missing in the Pacific Ocean, the seaborne defense warships in this port recently intercepted a telegram from the British-owned Nauru Island radio station. According to the telegram, the radio station received a radio signal between 8:43 AM and 8:54 AM this morning. Although the signal was vague and unrecognizable, it appeared to be the same as the signal sent by Earhart's aircraft yesterday. In addition, the seaborne defense warship Itasca, which sailed from Honolulu Harbor to Howland Island yesterday to search for Ms. Earhart, has now arrived 100 miles north of the island. According to reports, the warship has received a signal from Ms. Earhart, but it was weak and difficult to distinguish, and therefore the location cannot be determined. Once a clear signal is received, it will immediately set sail to rescue her. Based on the above information, the seaborne defense warship Captain Johnson and Ms. Earhart’s husband, Putnam, believe that Ms. Earhart must have landed on a desert island in the Pacific Ocean, several hundred miles away from Howland Island. (Putnam also believes that if Ms. Earhart's aircraft landed at sea, the aircraft's battery would definitely be flooded and lose its effectiveness, and it would definitely not be able to send a radio signal. Based on this, the aircraft must have landed on land.) And the personnel on board can be safe. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegraph)

[Washington] The US battleship "Colorado" was ordered by the Navy Department to sail to Honolulu Harbor to assist in the search for Ms. Earhart's aircraft. It arrived at the port yesterday and carried three aircraft on board. This morning, the Honolulu Harbor authorities first dispatched a seaplane to search everywhere, but it had to return halfway due to bad weather. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegraph)

[San Francisco] It was learned today that the US Navy aircraft carrier Lexington is prepared to assist in the search for female aviator Ms. Earhart. The Navy stated that the order has not yet been issued, but the ship has sailed to San Diego to gather flight personnel. The final decision will be made by the Navy Department or President Roosevelt. (National Telegram, 3rd)

[San Francisco] Putnam also told people, "After my wife, Ms. Earhart, completes her round-the-world flight, if she is rescued, she will give up long-distance flights. After that, we will live in seclusion in our old home in California to live a leisurely life." (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegraph)

### European Gypsy National Congress Held in Warsaw

⊙Warsaw: The European Gypsy National Congress is scheduled to be held at the sports field here at 6:00 PM tomorrow. More than 3,000 representatives of the Gypsy people from France, Romania, Poland, and Hungary will participate. The purpose of the congress is to elect a Gypsy King and crown him. The election method is that 3,000 representatives of the Gypsy people from all over the world will choose one of the five candidates from the Kweck dynasty to be King, and then present him with a scepter and crown, and put a silver rat on his body. Then, the Greek Orthodox priest will hold a religious ceremony. The last time the Gypsy King coronation ceremony was held was in the first century. Among the five current candidates, the most promising is Kweck Jonuzzi, who is registered in Poland. His political program is the same as that of previous Gypsy Kings, namely, to find land for the Gypsy people so that they can live and work in peace and not wander around the world. The former King Matthias once wrote to the King of England from the capital of Hungary, requesting that land be set aside in India to establish a Gypsy kingdom, but his wish was not fulfilled. It is said that after Jonuzzi is elected, he plans to ask Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to designate land in Abyssinia for the Gypsy people to live in. He believes that the Gypsy people will be able to adapt to the equatorial climate and that if they are transplanted, it will be of great benefit to Italy's colonial cause.

He also said that in the future, aircraft sailing on the Atlantic Ocean will fly at an altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 meters. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegraph)

### Palestine To Be Divided Into Three Zones

British Committee To Make Recommendations

⊙Jerusalem: According to informed sources in London’s Jewish circles, the report from the committee investigating the disturbances in Palestine will recommend that Palestine be divided into three major zones: Arab, Jewish, and British-administered. It is said that the Jewish zone will include Upper and Lower Galilee, the cities of Acre, Haifa, and the southern coast and plains, Safed, Acre, and Tiberias. Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and the area along the road from Jerusalem to Jaffa will belong to the British-administered zone. The remaining areas, up to Transjordan, will all be assigned to the Arab zone. It is rumored that the committee's report will be released next Thursday. If the rumors are true, both the Arabs and the Jews will inevitably rise up in opposition. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)

### Spain Surveillance Plan Expected to Propose a Compromise

Beerepo to Propose Three Measures; To Be Discussed After the French Ambassador Returns to England

[London] Regarding the new maritime surveillance plan for Spain, informed sources in Britain have recently stated that Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, or Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck will propose a compromise plan in order to break the deadlock. The content is as follows: ㊀ The maritime surveillance plan should be abolished, and personnel should be dispatched by the Adjustment Committee to be stationed in Spanish ports to carry out surveillance work. ㊁ Recognize both parties to the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups, but their rights should be limited to territorial waters. ㊂ Surveillance work on the Pyrenees Mountains in northern Spain should be extended to the country's territorial waters without interruption. Regarding the first point, the Spanish Northern and government has refused to establish a surveillance plan within its jurisdiction. If the Adjustment Committee dispatches surveillance officers to be stationed in the ports under the jurisdiction of the Republican government, and their tasks are limited to (a) being able to inquire with ships from various countries whether they are carrying inspectors, and (b) whether this ship has been issued an inspection certificate by personnel belonging to the Adjustment Committee when departing from foreign ports, the Spanish Republican government may accept it.

Regarding the second point, the aim is to maintain public sea traffic and international commerce, and not to allow it to be threatened.

Regarding the third point, the Italian Ambassador to England, Grandi, has recently made slight criticisms of French coastal merchant ships traveling to and from ports belonging to the Spanish government forces. If this line, that is, the surveillance measures at the land boundary between France and Spain, is extended to Spanish territorial waters, it will satisfy Italy.

However, this proposal is still exploratory in nature and will not have a concrete outline until French Ambassador Corbin returns to London from Paris. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegraph)

[Berlin] Authoritative sources here stated that when the Non-Intervention Committee holds a plenary meeting in a few days, German Ambassador Ribbentrop will restate Germany's position and explain the reasons for Germany's current policy. It is said that Germany will not put forward new proposals, and there is no sign of any change in Germany's attitude. Chancellor Hitler left Berlin today and will not return to Berlin until after a long period of time, so Germany will not take new steps. Foreign newspapers believe that Germany and Italy's proposal to recognize both parties to the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups is an attempt to avoid the collapse of the non-intervention policy, and people here unanimously confirmed this. After the failure of maritime surveillance, the French opposition to the continuation of land surveillance is difficult for German political circles to understand. (National Maritime Telegraph, 3rd)

### British Foreign Secretary Speech on Foreign Policy

Regarding Spanish Territory, Determined to Maintain Its Integrity

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech at the Conservative Party meeting in Coughton, Warwick County, his constituency, today, broadly discussing the international situation. He mentioned the Spanish issue and said, "As far as our country itself is concerned, we have no demands of Spain. We do not wish to interfere in what kind of political system Spain adopts. What we seek is only to maintain normal and friendly relations with Spain. Therefore, since the implementation of the ban, not a single gun or bullet, not a single aircraft has been transported to Spain, nor has a single officer or volunteer soldier been sent to Spain to assist in the war. We have strictly adhered to the principle of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War. This is known to both parties to the Spanish Civil War, and it is also known to people all over the world. The main goal of our government is to limit the war to within the borders of Spain and not to expand its scope. But in addition to this, there is one more thing that we are also concerned about, that is, the territorial integrity of Spain must be maintained, so that no one has any doubts about it." Eden then recalled his speech in the House of Commons in November last year, saying that the Mediterranean Sea of ​​Britain is not only the most convenient road, but also the artery of the British Empire. He also said that the relationship between Britain and France is better than ever before, and that the friendship between Britain and France does not contain any meaning of threatening any other country, nor does it exclude other countries. It can be called an ideal combination. As for the relationship between Britain and the United States, it is also extremely good now. Finally, he said that since the implementation of the British rearmament program, all countries in the world have unanimously agreed, especially some small countries. "The increasing strength of our country's military power is conducive to peace, and there is no need to worry about any malpractices. This is what people all over the world deeply believe."

### A Record of the International Exposition of Art and Technology (Part 1)

— Xiao Ke

The Paris International Exposition of Art and Technology officially opened on May 24th. France spent a full three years preparing for this exposition, investing a massive sum of 1.15 billion francs, and exhausting the minds of numerous architects and engineers in design work. Over 10,000 laborers were engaged in construction. For months, the tall buildings of the exposition in the heart of Paris sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

This 1937 Exposition site is built in the heart of Paris, along both banks of the Seine River. The main entrance is located at the famous Place de la Concorde (very close to the National Assembly and the Presidential Palace), gradually extending southwest to the Île aux Cygnes. The selection of the site for this exposition involved considerable effort. It differs in its scenery from the 1931 Colonial Exposition site, which was located in the Bois de Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris. However, the grandeur of the design far surpasses it. The exposition area covers over 10,000 acres, with a perimeter of seven and a half kilometers. There are a total of 280 halls and buildings within the site, with 44 built by foreign governments. The opening ceremony was held by French President Lebrun on the 24th of this month, and it officially opened to the public on the 25th, scheduled for six months. (We know that the exposition was originally scheduled to open on May 1st, but was delayed due to the rise of the Seine River and labor disputes. The work has not yet been fully completed and is expected to be finished by mid-June). According to the organizers' predictions, one million foreign tourists will be attracted during these six months, and the total number of visitors will be 35 million.

Before we enter the exposition site, we must first briefly describe its central entrance. At the entrance of the Place de la Concorde and the Rue Royale in the center of Paris, we can see four triangular metal pillars, each two meters wide, designed by architect Panl Blgot. They are 60 meters long, towering into the clouds. Each pillar is 17 meters apart and inlaid with crystal fragments, reflecting light day and night, dazzling the eyes. At one-third of the height, the left and right pillars have sculptures by famous artists, representing the meaning of art and technology. On the central two pillars, one side is a sailing ship, and the other is the Gallic rooster, the emblem of Paris and France. Each pillar has a specially designed lighting system. At night, eight powerful beams of light radiate into the sky, illuminating up to a hundred meters away. Proceeding from this central gate, we arrive at the exposition site. To make it easier for readers to understand, let's start with the foreign sections.

Belgian Pavilion—Belgium was the first country to respond to France's invitation to participate in this international exposition. It invested much effort, building even more magnificently than when it participated in 1925. The pavilion is located between the Eiffel Tower and the Pont d'Iéna, with a length of 165 meters. The entrance is on the Quai d'Orsay, decorated with terracotta, clay, and brass, which is very attractive to visitors. The pavilion displays valuable works of art, as well as inexpensive industrial products. Flemish porcelain and horticultural flowers occupy a large part. Another part is various promotional materials to attract people from all countries to travel to Belgium.

British Pavilion—Located by the Pont d'Iéna, on the Quai d'Orsay, with an area of 1,890 square meters, its front is 105 meters long. The pavilion has only one floor, with its hall occupying an area of 1,000 square feet, displaying Britain's main industrial products, such as the fiber industry, travel, sports, and hunting. Art, textiles, and machinery occupy a special section.

German Pavilion—Located on the Quai de Tokyo, its area covers 3,564 square meters. The front door is at the Place de Varsovie, built by ten square pillars 54 meters high into a tower. At the top of the tower stands a large bronze eagle grasping a swastika, to represent Germany and the Nazi Party's emblem. The walls are inlaid with stone slabs transported from eastern Germany. The interior retains very little space for the display of art and industrial products. The exhibits are strictly selected by the German government. There are also models of great buildings built since the Nazi Party took power.

Soviet Pavilion—Located between the Trocadéro Palace and the Eiffel Tower, it is 160 meters long and 21.5 meters wide. The front door faces the German Pavilion. On the high tower in the middle, there is a 24-meter-high bronze statue, representing the working farmers and laborers. It is the work of Mrs. Moukhina. The entire building is paved with marble transported from Central Asia. The most distinctive exhibit in the pavilion is a 20-meter-wide map of the Soviet Union, made of gemstones and semi-precious stones, which demonstrates its artistic nature and proves its national wealth. The abundance of raw materials ensures that there is no shortage. Audiences can get a clear understanding of the Soviet Union's political and economic status from this map. This can be said to be a unique exhibit in the exposition.

Austrian Pavilion—Located in the Trocadéro Gardens, it can be considered one of the most splendid and novel among the foreign pavilions. The architecture is directed by Professor Aswaid Haerdel, a famous architect from Vienna, in a purely Viennese style. The exterior and interior styles are novel and beautiful. The hall is made of cement and a special steel called Isleg, invented in Austria, which is extremely thin but has strong resistance and is very economical. The walls are engraved with famous figures from Austrian history, such as Grillparzer, Mozart, and Schubert. Exhibits include: steam and electric locomotives, accurate optical instruments. On the back wall of the hall is a large photograph composed of a map, indicating the mountain roads built in recent years. The GrossGlocknerstrasso major project is shown to the audience. Another room is dedicated to displaying handicrafts such as silverware, leather products, glass and porcelain, and Austrian specialties. There are also furniture from past royal families. The upper floor displays art and luxury industrial products, as well as skiing and travel promotions. Outside the pavilion's platform, there is a café that specializes in selling Austrian food, with open-air movies in the evening. Austrian music is world-renowned. Due to insufficient space in the pavilion, it is scheduled for June 28-29 and August 19-20, when the famous Austrian music team will come to France to perform publicly at the exposition site.

Egyptian Pavilion—Occupying an area of 2,400 square meters, it is located on the eastern high ground of the Trocadéro Gardens. The building is shaped like a triangular arc, with trees and a pond in the center. The hall extends backward, with two protruding houses on one side. The pink walls represent the hot colors of the East. The iron-forged front door was designed and manufactured by the Egyptian School of Applied Arts. In the glass tree in the middle of the hall, stone tools and wood carvings from primitive times are displayed, as well as utensils from five or six thousand years ago. This can also be said to be the most primitive prototype of modern art and technology. There are also models of the Nile River sluice gates and samples of agricultural and industrial products. In this pavilion, there will be organized lectures on modern Egyptian art, culture, and society.

Swiss Pavilion—Located on the left bank of the Seine River, near the Eiffel Tower, it has a total area of 3,000 square meters, with two floors. The entire building is made of metal, with glass on both the north and south sides. The roof uses a water flow method to cool the interior of the pavilion. The exhibits are divided into four groups: watches, the fiber industry, applied art products, and travel. The pavilion has two attached hotels: one is a famous hotel for those traveling to Switzerland, and the other is a mountain village-style hotel, so that visitors can feel as if they are there. There is also a cinema in the pavilion. From early July to August 1st, for the Swiss National Day, "A Week of Switzerland" will be organized, with various Swiss singing and dancing performances.

American Pavilion—The Washington government has approved $200,000 to build this pavilion, located on the side of the Eiffel Tower. It has been under construction for several months and is expected to be completed in mid-June. According to Julian claranoe Leri, the engineer in charge, its architectural style adopts the style of New York buildings, tall and grand, to express the temperament and style of American women. In this pavilion, a model of the 1939 New York Exposition site will be displayed.

### The Shadows of Security in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin)

A Certain Party Instigates Disgruntled Soldiers to Riot, Authorities in Both Places Tighten Security

Tianjin Correspondence: Recently, there have been many rumors in Pingjin. Since the arrest of a dozen or so bandits plotting to disrupt security by the Jibei Security Command on June 28th and 29th, Pingjin society has once again been shrouded in an atmosphere of unease and anxiety. People are unsettled, and rumors are rampant, even more so than before. Military and police in Beijing have already begun preparations. Tianjin City and the counties bordering its suburbs began summer defense preparations ahead of schedule on the 1st of this month. The city police bureau ordered all sub-bureaus to pay attention to household registration, inspect suspicious public residences, and implement joint water and land defense with the Water Police and Maritime Police Bureaus, increasing vigilance. Dasha Zhikou and Caijiatai, located at the boundary between the city and counties, are in a remote area and a gathering place for bandits. A large detachment of security forces was dispatched to be stationed there, starting on the 1st, to provide suppression and respond to Tianjin City. The three counties bordering Tianjin—Jinghai, Cangzhou—held a joint defense meeting on June 30th and decided on methods of mutual assistance and coordination with Tianjin City. When necessary, the special operations battalion of the 38th Division of the 29th Army stationed in Hanliutai and Yangliuqing in the suburbs of Tianjin will be transferred to the city to assist in defense. Although Song Zheyuan is on vacation, he is extremely concerned about the security of Pingjin. A few days ago, Yang Zhaogeng, the director of the Political Affairs Department of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, went to Leling to report on official duties. He was instructed to convey the orders to Zhang Zizhong, Qin Dechun, and others. Yang returned from Leling on the 29th, stopped in Tianjin overnight, conveyed Song's orders to Zhang Zizhong, and returned to Beijing on the 30th to inform Qin Dechun. The factors causing unrest in Pingjin this time are nothing more than a group of disgruntled former Zhili-Lu Army veterans, Zhang, Bai, Hao, etc., along with Liu Guitang, Ma Qianfu, Xia Zhenhua, Cheng Guorui, Qiu Wenkai, Wang Huchen, etc., all receiving support from the puppet organization in eastern Hebei and commanded by a certain special agency in Tianjin. More than a dozen Japanese ronin provide planning, using the slogan of "anti-communism and autonomy" to engage in disrupting local peace. On the Beijing side, Daxing, the outer city of Qingyuan, and Yongdingmen are used as secret gathering places. All puppet troops are bandits and stragglers from the Zhili-Lu border area, recruited by Liu Guitang, Qiu Wenkai, and their ilk. On the Tianjin side, Haixia, Xianshuigou, Sunzhuangzi, Junliangcheng, Dasha Zhikou, Heiniucheng, and Caijiatai are used as gathering places. The armaments were taken from a certain party's arsenal in the Northeast and transported by large ships to Tanggu. After being unloaded, they are transported by land to the agreed delivery point. This cunning plan has been carried out in secret for a long time. However, Liu Guitang and Ma Tingfu are still responsible for recruiting and training the puppet Chahar Anti-Communist Army, so they have not been able to act as hoped by a certain party. Recently, Song Zheyuan has been residing in Leling for a long time, and a certain party believes that North China has lost its political center of gravity, and the puppet Eastern Hebei organization is eager to expand, so they urged a riot. It is said that the original plan was to launch simultaneously in Pingjin on the night of July 1st, but the authorities learned of it in advance and were able to prevent it. The plan of a certain party and the treason of the Han traitors were severely hit. (1st)

### Investigation of Puppet Organization Troops

All Formations are Based on Japanese Intentions, but in Reality, They Are Entirely Controlled by the Japanese

Tokyo Correspondence: Recently, the Soviet-“Manchukuo” conflict has caused considerable anxiety among the authorities here. For several years, the hidden pain on both sides has had a tendency to explode. Since the 19th, the Soviet Russian army occupied the Qianchazi Island on the Heihe Chichet River, the Jin'amu Island opposite the Bikons-Tang Creek-Ssky, and on the 20th at 6 am, Soviet Russian gunboats and patrol boats, each with 30 soldiers, landed on Qianchazi Mountain, attacking under the cover of heavy and light machine guns. On the 21st, 40 Soviet Russian soldiers landed again, invading Dongjiadiyingzi. On the 24th, they completely occupied Qianchazi. Puyi's younger brothers, Puwei and Pujie, who were studying at the Army in Tokyo, were recalled to Changchun ahead of schedule. It is said that they were involved in military affairs. Pujie married a Japanese woman last year, and the woman is now pregnant and went to Changchun with him. According to a close confidant of Pujie, “In the ‘Soviet-Manchukuo’ conflict, the Japanese military will absolutely provide full assistance. The ‘Manchukuo’ puppet army and navy are under the command of the puppet executive, and the Japanese garrison commander and fleet commander are responsible for naval and land security, respectively. The puppet garrison commander is filled by a Lieutenant General or Major General of the army. The entire army is organized into brigades. This is the same as the old Northeast Army's organization under Zhang Xueliang. The composition of the brigades varies depending on the size of each local area. Approximately, each brigade has three regiments, and the regiment is the same as a Japanese regiment. A regiment has three battalions, which are equal to Japanese battalions. A battalion has four companies, equal to Japanese companies, and a company has three platoons, equal to Japanese platoons. The above is the organization of the infantry. The organization of the cavalry, artillery, engineers, and transport troops is also the same as Japan's. Regiment is equivalent to regiment, company is equivalent to battalion. The number of personnel in each unit varies. Some brigades do not reach 3,000 people, while others have as many as 10,000 people. The contents of the brigades are not unified, especially the puppet Rehe Army and the puppet Heilongjiang Army, which are disorganized. Therefore, it is difficult to count the number of troops. The brigades under the puppet Jilin Provincial Garrison Command have eight infantry brigades. Their contents vary greatly. The 1st Garrison Infantry Brigade has 2,348 people, the 2nd Brigade has 1,899 people, the 3rd Brigade has 3,839 people, the 5th Brigade has 4,978 people, the 6th Brigade has 611 people, the 7th Brigade has 2,340 people, and the 8th Brigade has 1,126 people. From this, it can be seen that some have as few as 600 people, while others have more than 4,000 people.

Japan, under the pretext of assisting "Manchukuo's national defense," divided the puppet organization into five military regions, under which garrison commands were established to control the puppet army. The organization of each military region is as follows:

The 1st Puppet Military Region Command, ㊀ 1st District Garrison Command, located in the puppet Andong Province: (A) Mixed 1st Brigade (B) Mixed 2nd Brigade, (C) Mixed 3rd Brigade, ㊁ 2nd District Garrison Command located in Fengtian: (A) Mixed 4th Brigade, (B) Mixed 5th Brigade (C) Mixed 6th Brigade, (D) 1st Training Unit,

The 2nd Puppet Military Region Command is located in the puppet Jilin Province, ㊀ 3rd District Garrison Command is located in Jilin: (A) Mixed 7th Brigade, (B) Mixed 8th Brigade, (C) Mixed 9th Brigade, ㊁ 4th District Garrison Command is located in Changchun: (A) Mixed 10th Brigade, (B) 1st Cavalry Brigade, (C) 2nd Cavalry Brigade (D) 3rd Cavalry Brigade, (E) 4th Cavalry Brigade, (F) 2nd Training Unit,

The 3rd Puppet Military Region Command is located in the puppet Qiqihar Province, ㊀ 5th District Garrison Command is located in Heihe: (A) Mixed 11th Brigade, ㊁ 6th District Garrison Command is located in Longjiang: (A) Mixed 12th Brigade (B) Mixed 13th Brigade (C) Mixed 14th Brigade, (D) Mixed 15th Brigade, (E) 5th Cavalry Brigade (F) 3rd Training Unit,

The 4th Puppet Military Region Command is located in Harbin, ㊀ 7th District Garrison Command is located in western Binjiang: (A) Mixed 15th Brigade, (B) Mixed 16th Brigade, (C) Mixed 17th Brigade, (D) Mixed 18th Brigade, ㊁ 8th District Garrison Command is located in eastern Binjiang: (A) Mixed 19th Brigade, (B) Mixed 20th Brigade, ㊂ 9th District Garrison Command is located in Sanjiang: (A) Mixed 21st Brigade, (B) Mixed 22nd Brigade, (C) Mixed 23rd Brigade, (D) 6th Cavalry Brigade (E) 4th Training Unit,

The 5th Puppet Military Region Command is located in Chengde, ㊀ 10th District Garrison Command is located in Jinzhou: (A) Mixed 24th Brigade, (B) Mixed 25th Brigade, ㊁ 11th District Garrison Command is located in Rehe: (A) Mixed 26th Brigade, (B) 7th Cavalry Brigade, (C) 5th Training Unit, the above includes five Military Region Commands, under which there are eleven District Garrison Commands, and five Training Units, the District Garrison Commands are divided into twenty-six Mixed Brigades and seven Cavalry Brigades, which is the organization created based on Japanese intentions.

In terms of the Navy, before the September 18th Incident, there were the First and Second Fleets under the jurisdiction of Zhang Xueliang. On the Songhua River, there was the River Defense Fleet. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the First and Second Fleets escaped and were taken in by the Central Government and stationed in Yantai and Weihaiwei. The River Defense Fleet participated in the puppet organization and was responsible for suppressing the volunteer armies along the Songhua River and for the so-called "border river" security. The Lushun Naval Base was once abolished but was restored by Japan in Showa 8 (1933). In order to guide the "Manchukuo" Navy, Japan established the Manchukuo Naval Department in Changchun and a temporary naval defense team in Harbin. The team has four ships and is responsible for the security of the Songhua River. The fleet commander is of the so-called Admiral rank.

### The Actual Situation of Disasters in Various Counties in Gansu (Continued)

And the Miserable Situation of Needing Relief

㊁ Bandit-affected areas: Gansu Province has a total of 66 counties and one administration bureau. Of these, 58 counties have been ravaged by bandits, almost the entire province. According to reports, bandit gangs passed through various places, or occupied and searched, or robbed and tortured, digging three feet into the ground and burning everything. Many strong men and women were abducted. The people's stored food and livestock were looted. The people resisted, and many were brutally killed.

㊂ Losses from bandits: 1. According to reports from 36 counties, the number of people killed was 23,781 (those who fled to the mountains and starved to death and those who were abducted are not included). 2. According to reports from 36 counties, the loss of various food supplies was 3,155,485 stones (this refers to the old measuring instruments. According to the old measuring instruments in various places, one stone is equivalent to about three stones of the new measuring instruments). If each stone is calculated at an average market price of 20 yuan, it is worth approximately 63 million yuan. Also, according to reports from 36 counties, the loss of various livestock was 10,376,032 heads. If each head is calculated at an average of 3 yuan, it is worth approximately 31 million yuan. As for the 22 counties that have not reported these two losses, if we assume that the ratio of the two losses in the 36 counties that have already reported is more than 94 million yuan, then it would be more than 57 million yuan. The total loss of food and livestock in the 58 counties is about 151 million yuan. 3. Loss of houses in the 58 disaster-stricken counties: Zhu reported the total number. If we assume 5 stones per household, calculated with 3,032,323 people, there are a total of 600,640 households. If each household's house has two rooms, and each room is calculated at a minimum of 10 yuan, then the loss of houses in the 58 counties is 12 million yuan. 4. The three items of farming tools, furniture, clothing, and bedding of the disaster-stricken households in the 58 counties have not been reported. However, if we assume that each household's value is at least 10 yuan, then the loss of farming tools, furniture, clothing, and bedding in the 58 counties is 18 million yuan. In total, the above losses amount to more than 181 million yuan. As for the hidden cash and opium, they are not included.

㊂ Statistics of disaster victims: According to reports from 36 counties, there are 2,591,851 disaster victims in urgent need of relief. Adding the 440,472 disaster victims in the 22 counties that continued to be affected, the total is 3,032,323. According to the statistics of households and population in the townships and villages of Gansu Province at the end of the 24th year, the total population number recorded in the statistics of strong men is 6,678,685. Now, the disaster victims in all counties of the province account for almost half of the total population. The severity of the disaster can be imagined.

(丙) Regarding the actual situation of natural disasters in May and June of the 26th year: In May of the 26th year, those affected by hail disasters, as of the 22nd of June, include Doshui, Gangu, Weiyuan, Longxi, Tongwei, Huixian, Lintao, Jingchuan, Chengxian, Kangle, Linxia, ​​Linze, Gaolan, and other 13 counties. Those affected by wind and sand black frost disasters include Linze, Jinta, and Zhangye. Those affected by drought and frost have Huaping County. There may be continuous reports after this. According to the above 16 counties, except for Jingchuan and Huaping, the previous year was already affected by bandit disasters, and then affected by hail and wind. Before the hail fell, there were strong winds, thunder, and hailstones as big as soybeans and chicken eggs, sweeping in. People and livestock in the wild who could not escape were mostly injured or even killed. Houses were also damaged, and the crops were even more unspeakable. Weiyuan County presented photos showing large hail as high as people and weighing more than 600 catties. Recently, the hailstones in Linze County were as big as a foot, with a width of fifty or sixty miles. Farmers picked them up and went to the county to ask for verification. They were all like basins. As for the wind and sand disaster, first, the yellow earth covers the sky, and then the gale carries sand, howling and rushing, blowing off ancient trees, destroying houses, and burying crops. The disaster is not only the black frost that kills the crops alone. The remaining disaster victims, who borrowed seeds for spring plowing, lost their harvest in one day. What a terrible pain!

(丁) Regarding the miserable situation in urgent need of relief: ㊀ The drought relief funds previously distributed to various counties: In the water-rich, Shandan, Zhangye Linze, Gaotai, Jinta, Dingxin, Minle, Jiuquan, Yumen, Anxi, Dunhuang, and other twelve counties in Hexi, the drought disaster was severe, with a total of 433,221 disaster victims. The Disaster Relief Preparation Fund Management Committee allocated 10,000 yuan, the Provincial Disaster Relief Association allocated another 1,500 yuan, and donations from all walks of life totaled 15,784 yuan and 45 cents. In addition, 150,000 yuan of government bonds allocated by the Central Government, converted into 147,273 yuan and 70 cents in legal tender, allocated 85,273 yuan and 70 cents, totaling 112,558 yuan, 15 cents. After deducting 8,058 yuan and 15 cents designated for the expenses of the Jiuquan disaster children, there are still 104,500 yuan for disaster relief, which is distributed to the disaster victims. The provincial government sent personnel to go to the county to distribute non-relief funds to the disaster victims with the county magistrates. According to the regulations of the Central Disaster Relief Committee, each person is given 1 yuan, and only 104,500 people can be relieved (to be continued).

### Songjiang

Police Officer Steals Gun, Plans Robbery

Jiang, a police officer from the second police station outside the west gate of this county, went to the county police bureau on the morning of the 1st and took away the wooden-cased gun of a colleague, a certain police officer. When the police officer discovered it in the afternoon, Jiang was suspected. The detective team sent investigators to the second police station and detained Jiang for strict interrogation. He confessed to stealing the gun and planned to go to the water patrol team post outside the north gate with his colleague Fang and soldiers from a certain team at about 12 o'clock to rob guns, and then at 2 o'clock, they would go to the Bank of China outside the west gate to rob. According to the confession, the police bureau found the original gun at the friend's house of the Jiang suspect. A soldier and a policeman are being strictly interrogated.

### Baoshan

Strict Prohibition of Cultivation on Beach Slopes

Residents of this county cultivate plants on the beach slopes beside the river, which is very common. However, over time, the soil becomes loose and the rivers are silted, which is of great importance to water conservancy. In view of this, the county government strictly ordered the district chiefs to instruct the township chiefs to pay close attention and prohibit it at any time. Those who violate will be arrested.

### Suzhou

Resolution of the Tong Shun Pawnshop Dispute

After Wang Tianxi proposed the transfer of the Wu Qu Fang Tong Shun Pawnshop to Jiang Zhihe, various staff members, dissatisfied with the new regulations set by Jiang, engaged in a work stoppage that lasted nearly a month. It is now learned that on the third day, the management agreed to pay each employee 50 months' salary, and all external staff were dismissed. The dispute has thus been resolved.

Suzhou Doctor Accused of Performing an Abortion

Wang Wenxi, a renowned traditional Chinese medicine doctor residing in Liu Xiang, is nearly sixty years old and has a well-established reputation. Recently, a woman named Jin Yunzhen filed a lawsuit with the local court accusing Wang Wenxi of performing an abortion and requesting an investigation. The court is currently investigating.

### Chongming

Settlement of the Fu'an Factory Labor Strike

Workers at the Fu'an Yarn Factory in this county's fort town have repeatedly staged strikes. After an investigation by the provincial government, the fort town textile industry labor union is suspected of instigating the strikes. The Chongming County Government has received instructions via telegram from Provincial Government Chairman Chen, Construction Department Director Shen, and Civil Affairs Department Director Yu to temporarily detain Li Jianping and other leading workers. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 37, Item 3 of the Labor Union Law, the union has been dissolved.

### Seven Exhibitions to Open Simultaneously for the 10th Anniversary of the Municipal Government

A Ceremony in the Morning, a Lantern Parade at Night, Enthusiastic Mood, Government and People Rejoice Together

### Air Defense Association Screens Various Air Defense Films at the Nanjing Grand Theater

Invites the Press and Air Defense Exhibition Staff, Free Admission to Screenings at Various Theaters on the 7th

The Air Defense Exhibition, commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Shanghai Municipal Government, has received the support of the Military Affairs Commission's Mobile Air Defense Exhibition, which has transported all materials to Shanghai for display. All the films from the association have also been transported. The Air Defense Exhibition Preparatory Office specially screened the films at the Nanjing Grand Theater yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, inviting the Air Defense Exhibition staff and members of the press to attend. After the opening of the 10th anniversary celebration on July 7th, the films will be distributed to various movie theaters, allowing citizens free admission. The films screened yesterday included one Japanese gas defense film, one Japanese air defense film, one Italian aviation performance film, one German air defense equipment demonstration film, one Capital air defense drill film, and one air defense slide film. Su Gongwang, the director-general of the Aviation Exhibition, provided an oral explanation on site. Over a thousand people attended yesterday. The two-hour film screening provided extremely detailed information on air defense, gas defense, rescue, lighting control, and both active and passive measures. One section, "The Front Line of Blood," was particularly intense, vividly demonstrating the power and destructive force of airplanes dropping bombs. Another section showed an air defense flight squadron being ordered to take off to fight the enemy, with each pilot vying to die for the cause, winning the audience's praise and admiration. There were many other exciting parts, such as (1) tank warfare, (2) the imminent outbreak of a world war, (3) the importance of not leaving one's battle station, (4) gas rescue procedures, (5) the release of smoke screens, (6) field rescue teams, (7) disinfection work, (8) aerial combat, (9) Germany's passive air defense, and (10) parachuting to safety. In particular, the air defense slide film gradually demonstrated aerial combat scenarios, explaining the interconnectedness of anti-aircraft guns, listening devices, heliographs, and altimeters. It was truly an unprecedented national defense film. The audience watched intently, holding their breath, and did not even have time to applaud at the exciting parts. Only when the words "Everyone work hard on air defense" appeared at the end did the audience leave. Furthermore, to ensure that citizens have a deep understanding of the exhibited items and equipment and can use them in the event of an emergency, the association has specially hired students from major secondary schools in the city to serve as guides. However, since air defense knowledge requires specialized expertise, a discussion meeting will be held today at 2:00 PM at the association's preparatory office for all current air defense equipment guides. Instructors from the Military Affairs Commission's Mobile Air Defense Exhibition and the head of the association's explanation team will provide guidance and training.

### Cooperation Between Han and Yi Peoples: Yi Representatives Gao Yuzhu and Others Discuss the Past Year of Petitioning

Petitioning Three Times, Gaining National Recognition and Sympathy; Preparing to Return Soon, Striving for Tangible Results

Gao Yuzhu, a representative of the Tusi (chieftain) along the southwestern Yi ethnic group border, along with Yu Jiecai and other representatives of the people, have been petitioning in Beijing since June of last year, exceeding one year. They have received high praise from the central government and have been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Beijing and Shanghai. Their statements have been scattered across domestic and foreign newspapers and magazines, but a systematic record of the representatives' petitioning process is still lacking. Recently, a reporter, knowing that the representatives are about to return to the south, visited Gao and Yu at their residence to understand the actual situation. They graciously shared the following:

Motivation for Petitioning in Beijing

The Yi and Miao ethnic groups are scattered in the southwestern provinces along the border, with a population of no less than 20 million. In the past, due to poor transportation and cultural backwardness, border officials treated them as uncivilized, and the border people were often bullied. The government's reach was limited, leaving them to fend for themselves. The suffering of the Yi and Miao peoples reached its peak. The southwestern border areas inhabited by the Yi and Miao are adjacent to the territories of Annam and Burma. Foreigners took the opportunity to invade, coerce, and entice, and the border people were often deceived by them. Historically, border territories have been lost, and the national defense of the southwest is precarious. All our advanced Tusi and enlightened youth of the Yi and Miao peoples, witnessing the suffering of the ethnic groups and the crisis of border defense, were filled with grief and indignation, and they ran around calling for help to ensure their survival. Historically, the Yi and Miao peoples in the border areas of various provinces have been governed by the Tusi. The provincial governments, recognizing the significant challenges posed by the Yi and Miao issue, found it difficult to handle alone. Therefore, they should request the central government to coordinate the matter. The previous year, Chairman Chiang visited the southwest and paid great attention to the education, healthcare, and national defense of the Yi people. He instructed the Tusi representatives to send representatives to Beijing to report to the central government and to promote awareness among the people, to bridge the gap between the Yi and Han peoples, and to unite sincerely under the leadership of the central government to overcome national difficulties together. Our Tusi representatives received this guidance and contacted the Tusi from Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang to discuss the petitioning process. Entrusted by all parties, the representatives spent about a year preparing in the southwestern provinces before traveling directly to Beijing from Chongqing to petition. This is a brief overview of the initial work.

The Petitioning Process in Beijing

There were about 20 people who came together this time. After arriving in Beijing, they stayed at the Southwestern Yi Ethnic Cultural Promotion Association. They submitted the petition signed and stamped by the Tusi, as well as the representatives' proposed petition opinions, to the State Council and other agencies, requesting a meeting and review. After the central government forwarded the original case to the southwestern provincial governments for review, the representatives waited in Beijing for more than a month before the heads of various ministries and commissions of the central government summoned them separately, inquiring in great detail. Regarding the issues of party affairs, government, military, education, economy, healthcare, and national representation of the Yi people, the representatives formally petitioned the relevant authorities, and all were accepted and reviewed. They received official instructions, and the State Council forwarded the entire petition to the Interior Ministry for review. After repeated reviews by the Interior Ministry, detailed instructions were given. This was the result of the representatives' first petition. At this time, in order to inform the public about this important issue, the Central Propaganda Department formally invited the press and literary circles of the capital to meet with the representatives to report on the situation of the Yi chieftains and the initial petition process. This aroused sympathy and attention from all walks of life. This was the beginning of the representatives' public dialogue with their fellow countrymen. In addition to handling petition matters, the representatives were welcomed to visit and lecture at various schools and organizations. Subsequently, due to the occurrence of the Liangguang Incident, the central government's response to the representatives' requests to send senior officials to conduct investigations and organize investigation teams was effectively suspended. The representatives continued their work in Beijing and collaborated with the Southwestern Yi Ethnic Cultural Promotion Association to publish the "New Yi Ethnic Group" to promote awareness. During the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, the representatives presented ten suggestions for a second petition. The session forwarded the original case to the National Government's State Council, and relevant agencies appointed personnel to jointly study concrete measures. The State Council meeting gave detailed instructions and made concrete decisions regarding Yi and Miao education and the establishment of Yi and Miao health hospitals, ordering their implementation. At the same time, the relevant agencies issued passports, orders, publicity materials, and survey forms to the representatives, ordering them to return to the southwest to carry out publicity and investigation work and to assist the local government in implementing Yi and Miao education. The representatives, having achieved initial results, immediately sent the accompanying personnel back to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou to prepare for work. They also finalized various procedures in preparation for departure. Subsequently, with the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, the representatives made a third petition, requesting the Central Committee members concerned with the Yi and Miao issue to propose motions separately regarding the education and healthcare of the Yi and Miao peoples. The session passed the motions and incorporated the representatives' petition opinions into the original case to formulate concrete plans for implementation. The representatives believed that the petitioning process had come to an end. They obeyed the central government's orders, left Beijing for Shanghai, and prepared to return to the south to work, hoping to achieve tangible results in practice.

Work Situation in Shanghai

The main purpose of the representatives' arrival in Shanghai was to gather leaders from all walks of life concerned with the Yi and Miao issue to form an organization. Therefore, after more than a month of visits and lectures in Shanghai, they formally initiated the organization of the Southwestern Border Area Advancement Association, requesting leaders from all walks of life to participate and provide guidance. They received enthusiastic support from all sectors, which can be seen as a harbinger of Han-Yi cooperation with unlimited prospects. The representatives are currently finalizing various procedures and preparing for departure, which may happen in a week or so.

Reflections on the Past Year

In the past, few people paid attention to the Yi and Miao issue. Since the representatives' petition, not only has the central government bestowed its grace, but the people of the country have also gone from ignorance to recognition, from discrimination to sympathy, and further to assistance in development and investigation. Various opinions have emerged like a rising tide. This not only gives hope to the future of the Yi and Miao peoples but is also a good sign of national progress. The representatives, as remote Yi people, are uneducated and unskilled. This time, inspired by the central government and encouraged by domestic pioneers, their gratitude and excitement cannot be expressed in words. It shows that the advanced ethnic groups in the country care for the backward ethnic groups in the border areas more than ever.

Hopes for Future Work

In addition to what has been briefly mentioned above, the representatives will strive to work as hard as possible when they return to the south. Soon, they will be able to show considerable results to live up to everyone's expectations. It should be stated here that the representatives have been treated with courtesy by the central government and various places, but all expenses have been borne by themselves, without receiving assistance from any party. This is a source of comfort to them. They also hope that all sectors of the country will pay more attention to the Yi and Miao issue and provide practical guidance to unite the ethnic groups and consolidate border defense under the unified leadership of the central and local governments.

### Anti-Smuggling Association Holds Plenary Meeting Today

Deliberating to Submit Corrections to the Shanghai Municipal Council; Organizing Citywide Store Pledge

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement unreasonably interfered with the anti-smuggling publicity and prevented the insertion of promotional slogans in various cinemas, it has aroused unanimous indignation from all sectors. It is learned that the Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee of various sectors in Shanghai believes that the anti-smuggling movement is related to safeguarding the national economy and ensuring the normal commercial affairs of various countries in China. It can only be effective through widespread publicity. Therefore, it is scheduled to convene a plenary meeting of the committee at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce today to discuss ways to continue the publicity and submit corrections to the Shanghai Municipal Council. At the same time, the association has decided to first organize a citywide store pledge, as stipulated in the outline of its work. To this end, the association has prepared a three-part promotional document and is ready to entrust various trade associations to distribute it to member stores for processing. It is stipulated that the first part of the pledge, once completed, should be posted in the store for identification. The second part is kept by the trade association, and the third part is collected by the association for reference.

### Plans to Build a Bridge Across the Huangpu River to Improve Transportation Between Pudong and Puxi

Pudong Citizens Eager for Early Realization; Municipal Authorities Considering Funding Issues

In order to improve transportation between Pudong and the urban area, the municipal authorities previously planned to build a bridge across the Huangpu River. The municipal authorities, in view of the fact that Pudong and Puxi are separated by the river, resulting in uneven prosperity, and considering the distorted development of various urban constructions in Shanghai in recent years, planned to build the bridge to maintain balanced and rational urban development, to ensure traffic safety, and to improve the living conditions of the general public. The bridge would help the development of the Pudong market on the one hand, and improve the crowded conditions of Puxi residents on the other, which is of great significance. Therefore, when the municipal government formulated the city center plan five years ago, the construction of the Pudong Bridge was also one of the main tasks, and a preliminary design plan had been drawn up. However, due to limited funding at that time, the construction of the Pudong Bridge had to be postponed. It is learned that many Pudong fellow villagers and celebrities, in view of the fact that the main construction projects planned for the city center have been largely completed, such as the Pudong Water Plant and other public constructions in Pudong, which have been completed one after another, and in view of the actual needs of the Pudong Bridge construction plan, also believe that it is necessary to seek its realization as soon as possible. Therefore, they recently requested the municipal authorities to proceed as soon as possible in their private capacity. According to the Shenzhou News Agency reporter, it was learned from relevant parties yesterday that the municipal authorities had already decided on the principle of building the bridge and now also believe that the project is of great importance to the future development of Shanghai. Therefore, they are prepared to expedite its realization within the possible scope. However, the construction cost of the bridge is estimated at around six million yuan. Therefore, the first step of the municipal authorities is to raise funds first. According to experts, the funds can be recovered after the bridge is completed. In addition, the land price in Pudong will inevitably increase due to the completion of the bridge, so the municipal authorities' revenue from the land price tax will also be sufficient to offset the cost. Therefore, there are generally no major difficulties with the funding issue. In addition, regarding the construction site of the bridge, it has been proposed to base it on the nearby city center area. The municipal government did not make a concrete decision on this when it formulated the preliminary plan in the past. Therefore, it is roughly necessary to make a concrete decision after the funding is determined, because the width of the river surface and the geological conditions at the bridge construction site will need to be appropriately considered.

### New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Informs Member Pharmacies to Display Medical Equipment

Shanghai has many pharmacies with rich materials. Please ask your association to inform the member pharmacies to collect as much as possible complete catalogs, manuals, price lists, and samples of all medicines and equipment, extract two copies, and send them to our office for Liu Yandong, a technician, to collect and compile before the end of July this year. In the future, new products should still be inspected and submitted in the same way for supplementation." If you have the above items to send for supplementation, please send them directly to the office of Liu Yandong (inside the Ministry of Health) in Nanjing.

### Record of the Maiden Voyage of the Ping-Kong Route by Eurasia Aviation Corporation from Shanghai to Hong Kong

The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Ping-Kong (Beiping-Hong Kong) route commenced on the 29th of last month. The first flight took off from Beiping at 6:00 AM, passing through Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Changsha, and Guangzhou before arriving in Hong Kong. The entire journey covered over 2,300 kilometers and was completed in twelve hours. This route connects with the Shanghai-Shaanxi route in Zhengzhou, allowing passengers to travel from Shanghai to Hong Kong or from Shaanxi to Beiping on the same day, marking a new era in China's north-south transportation. It also links with the Far East routes of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Guangdong and Hong Kong, representing the initial stage of Eurasia's global air service. To inspect the route, Mr. Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company, took a special flight from Shanghai to Hankou and then proceeded to Hong Kong, where he received a warm welcome from the local government. He returned to Shanghai on the second day. This Shanghai branch reporter from the Central News Agency was honored to accompany him on this trip and felt greatly delighted. Now, a record of this journey follows:

Beginning of the Journey

On the morning of the 29th, the light rain had not stopped, and a gloomy haze filled the field, seemingly unwilling to clear up quickly. There was some concern that the plane would not depart on time, making it impossible to reach Hong Kong that day. Arriving at Longhua Airport in the rain at around 5:40 AM, with less than twenty minutes to departure time, several passengers had already arrived and were sitting in the waiting room. A large aircraft was parked in front of the station with its engine running, making a deafening noise. Workers were busy carrying mailbags and luggage. At 6:00 AM, the engine noise stopped, and the station staff informed the passengers to board the plane, indicating that the Shanghai-Shaanxi flight had departed on time. When the reporter contacted the company, he was instructed to take the plane westward first and then transfer to the Ping-Kong flight in Zhengzhou to head south. However, the station staff did not inform the reporter to board the plane, indicating a misunderstanding. Without detailed inquiry, at that moment, Mr. Walter, a reporter from Reuters, was also in the room waiting for a short poem. Mr. Li Jingcong arrived at the station and explained the situation, offering sincere apologies. Shortly after, the engine sound resumed, indicating a specially arranged flight. He and Mr. Li boarded the plane together, starting the long journey of two thousand kilometers.

Taking Off in the Rain

The plane took off at 7:00 AM in the rain. The group included Mr. Li and his family, Mr. Holz, the director of the flight crew, Mr. Guan Rong, the director of the Hong Kong station, and the reporter, totaling six people. The pilots were Mr. He'erqiu and Mr. Shitinuote, with two attendants accompanying them. After taking their seats, the attendants provided small bags of cotton for earplugs to protect the eardrums from vibration. They also fastened the seatbelts for the passengers, fearing the tilting of the aircraft during ascent. Once the plane reached the air, it was exceptionally stable. The seatbelts could be removed, and one could walk around in the cabin. It was the reporter's first time on such a long-distance journey in the air, so he was extremely excited. Unfortunately, the weather that day was poor, and clouds and fog obscured the view, preventing a panoramic view of Shanghai, which was quite a pity. The flight was specially arranged, so it headed directly west to Hankou, a distance of about six hundred kilometers, crossing the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui. Within Jiangsu province, flying above the clouds, looking out the window revealed nothing but a vast expanse. Just as he was sitting idly, the attendants brought newspapers and magazines to pass the time. Soon, a line of blue sky appeared at the edge of the clouds, indicating that the weather ahead was turning clear. After about an hour of flight, the rising sun dissipated the heavy clouds, which condensed into giant blocks drifting across the sky, reflecting the sunlight, sparkling like snow. Looking down at the earth, barren mountains appeared intermittently. On the far left, tall, green mountains stretched continuously, like a natural barrier. Around 9:00 AM, Yangzi River County came into view. In the distance, densely packed houses were visible along the riverbank, indicating arrival at Hankou.

Gliding Over the River to Reach Hankou

The plane gradually slowed down and began to descend, gliding north over the river. The sails of boats in the river could be counted clearly. The three towns of Wuhan formed a tripod, and the city appeared quite dense. Hankou Airport was located outside the city, north of the racecourse, with simple facilities. At 10:35 AM, the plane landed safely. The weather was extremely hot and humid. After a short rest, it was learned that the southbound plane from Beiping, which had only stopped in Zhengzhou for ten minutes, was expected to arrive around 1:00 PM. Therefore, accompanied by Mr. Zhou Bohan, the station director, he entered the city. The streets they passed were exceptionally clean, and the buildings along the river were magnificent, no less than those in Shanghai. They first rested at the company's office by the river and then went to Guanshengyuan for lunch. Upon hearing that Mr. Li Yaoqing, the director of the Wuhan branch of the Central News Agency, was also traveling, they contacted him by phone and had a pleasant meeting. Upon returning to the airport, the southbound plane had arrived, carrying Mr. Xu Chequn, a reporter from the Beiping branch of the Central News Agency, and two foreign reporters. After exchanging names, they took a group photo to commemorate the occasion.

Departing from Hankou to Continue the Journey

At 1:15 PM, they departed from Hankou to continue the journey, crossing the river and heading southwest. This area was the Jianghan Plain, which was very low-lying. The previous year, the Yangtze River had flooded, causing a major disaster. Although dikes had been built for protection, the accumulated water in low-lying areas could not be drained away. From the plane, almost everything appeared to be swamps. Occasionally, villages stood isolated in the water like small islands. In the shallow water areas, the green color of the fields could still be seen. Areas not submerged were brown, probably because they were deserted and uncultivated. After about half an hour of flight, the terrain gradually rose, and the peaks on the left side soared into the clouds, almost level with the plane, being the Mufu Mountains. Chatting with Mr. Xu, he learned that the flight south from Beiping, passing through Hebei and Shanxi provinces, had traversed the Taihang Mountains, which were all towering peaks and ridges. Approaching the Yellow River, the mountain cliffs stood as steep as walls, with plains lying ahead, a unique sight. It was a pity not to have seen it.

Crossing Hunan and Entering Guangdong

Passing Yuezhou, the terrain was very high, with terraced fields carved into the mountainsides, dry and arid, with pale yellow soil. Scattered village houses were nestled in the valleys, all concave in shape with openings facing south. The buildings seemed to be made of mud and stone and were quite sturdy. After another half-hour of flight, parallel to the railway, they arrived at Changsha. At 2:35 PM, they landed at the airport, where representatives from the Hunan Provincial Government and reporters were waiting to greet them, offering tea and refreshments. After a few minutes of rest, they boarded the plane at 2:45 PM to continue the journey, heading south along the Xiang River. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway was on their left. In the center of the river was Changzhou, with sharp ends, formed by alluvial deposits. The plane was flying at an altitude of one thousand meters, and the scenery on the ground was still very clear. After less than half an hour, between Wugong Mountain and Hengshan Mountain, they ascended to two thousand meters, flying through the clouds. Gradually climbing higher, five hundred feet, eight hundred feet, and reaching three thousand meters, they approached the Dayu Ridge at the border of Hunan and Guangdong provinces, still amidst the clouds. Visibility was obstructed, and a sudden chill filled the air, feeling extremely refreshing. Moisture on the glass windows condensed into water droplets. As the clouds dispersed, overlapping green mountains and winding streams in the valleys appeared, creating a picturesque scene, being the source of the North River, which joined the Northeast River to form the Pearl River, the main stream of Lingnan. As the clock pointed to 5:00 PM, they were over the vast plains of the Pearl River Delta. The plains stretched for thousands of miles, with crisscrossing waterways, indicating the wealth of the land. Dense village houses were visible. Approaching the outskirts of Guangzhou, hills were covered with tombs, built with white stones into semicircles, resembling large chairs, reflecting the importance the Cantonese placed on elaborate funeral rituals.

Center of Air Routes

During the trip, Mr. Li chatted and was asked to express his views on the opening of the Ping-Kong route. He stated that Hong Kong had become the de facto aviation center of the Far East. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation was willing to cooperate with the aviation organizations gathered in Hong Kong, with its punctual schedules, safe transport, and spirit of service, so that Far East aviation and international aviation would develop daily. He also hoped that in the near future, an international aviation center could be established in a certain part of the country to cooperate with Hong Kong and achieve prosperity together. The reporter drafted a telegram for the Guangzhou branch to publish. Around 6:00 PM, they arrived in Guangzhou, landing at Shou Gou Ling Airport. Mr. Liang Naixian, the director of the Guangdong branch of the Central News Agency, and others came to greet them. After a short conversation, they continued the flight. Mr. Nie Yaoxun, the director of the Guangdong Postal Bureau, boarded the plane here. The journey from Guangdong to Hong Kong was only forty kilometers, following the Pearl River southeast, taking about forty minutes. The west bank of the Shao River was fertile land, with fields in rows, almost level with the water, making irrigation very convenient. Gradually, the river widened, indicating nearing the sea. In the distance, mountains were scattered in the sea, thought to be Hainan Island. At 6:35 PM, they arrived in Hong Kong, completing the twelve-hour flight.

The Terrain of Hong Kong Island

Hong Kong was ceded to the United Kingdom during the Opium War and has since become a base for the United States in the Far East. Maintaining its maritime commerce and waterways, it has become an important commercial port through years of operation. The city is located in the northern part of the island, built against the mountains, facing Kowloon across the sea. Due to the development of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, it is also becoming increasingly important. The Hong Kong station is also located here, and the Hong Kong government borrows the grounds of Kai Tak Aviation School for use. The other areas are also backed by mountains, so aircraft must land along the coast, which is quite inconvenient. Upon arrival, Mr. Smith, the acting Governor of Hong Kong, Mr. Jiberlyshu, the German Consul-General in Hong Kong, and seven hundred British and German citizens were waiting to greet them. Mr. Li and others disembarked and shook hands with the welcomers. They then gathered in front of the plane, and the German Consul and Mr. Li successively delivered speeches, expressing gratitude for the support of Hong Kong. After the speeches, they were invited to board the plane for a tour and were treated to champagne at the bar outside the hangar to celebrate the success of the maiden voyage. Mr. Lu Qixin, the director of the Hong Kong branch of the Central News Agency, and reporter Han Wengan came to greet them and led them out of the airport by car and across the sea to Hong Kong for rest, staying at the Hotel des Six Nations in Kowloon.

A Short Trip to Guangzhou

In Hong Kong, they spent a day touring the entire island by car, and taking the mountain tram to the summit. The entire city was visible, especially beautiful at night with twinkling lights. After dinner, they boarded a ship to Guangzhou. Mr. Liang, the director of the Guangdong branch of the Central News Agency, and others welcomed them at the port. They checked into a hotel to rest. The next morning, they toured the city. The streets were wide and flat, and traffic was frequent. They first visited the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, a magnificent building that could accommodate ten thousand people. The Guangdong Party, government, and military held a joint memorial week here every first week of the month. They then went outside the city to pay respects at the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs. They then boarded a car and drove up Baiyun Mountain, visiting Sun Yat-sen University, which was magnificently built at a cost of over ten million yuan. However, it was said that its internal facilities were not yet fully complete. In the evening, they returned to the hotel to rest. The Guangdong branch invited them to a feast at the Dasanyuan Restaurant on Changdi, with Mr. Liu Yinsun, the president of Guohua News, Mr. Qiu Zhenge, the president of Guangzhou Daily, and Mr. Chen Danshuang, the president of Zhongshan Daily, in attendance. After the feast, they returned to the hotel to pack, as they would be taking a flight north the next morning.

Return Trip to Shanghai

Mr. Li Jingyi, the general manager of Eurasia Aviation, also returned north on the same day after finishing his business in Hong Kong, meeting the reporter on the plane. The plane was still number 18. Arriving at Hankou, they had a simple meal and rested for about half an hour. Flight number 19 continued the journey. Arriving in Zhengzhou, the clouds were very low. After landing, all the passengers from Shaanxi disembarked, and there was heavy rain in Xi'an, causing an eight-hour delay. They rested under the hangar. Then, it rained heavily in Zhengzhou, and they rushed into the station to take shelter. Later, they heard the rumble of an engine, and plane number 21 had arrived in Zhengzhou from Shaanxi, while plane number 19 flew north back to Beiping. The reporter boarded plane number 20 heading east. There were already three male and female passengers on the plane. Four people boarded in Zhengzhou, bringing the total to eleven, and all the seats were full. The two planes took off one after another, heading in different directions. The wind and rain were heavy, and the weather was very hot and humid. Sitting idly on the plane, recalling the three-day journey south, it was almost like a dream. After about three hours of flight, they returned to Longhua Airport at 7:00 PM. This trip, which lasted only four days, covered more than four thousand kilometers, passing through the eight provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Fujian, and Guangdong, allowing them to enjoy the convenience of travel to Guangzhou and Hong Kong, something that previous generations could not have dreamed of. Its smoothness and comfort were beyond his expectations.

### A Large-Scale Brawl Among Gangsters Occurs at the Intersection of Zhongshan Road and Hutai Road in Zhabei

Iron Rods, Sharp Blades, and Broadaxes—All Prepared; One Person Bathed in Blood, Multiple People Severely Injured

Around 9:00 PM the night before last, dozens of gangsters engaged in a brawl at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Hutai Road in Zhabei. Several people were injured at the time. Later, mediators stepped in to mediate a resolution, but unexpectedly, around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the gangsters resumed their retaliation. An argument broke out, and iron and wooden rods, axes, sharp knives, etc., were all used. As a result, one person named Chen Linggen, 21 years old, a local resident and bamboo craftsman living at Gongjiazhai in the area, was struck on the back of the head with an axe. He collapsed to the ground, bathed in blood. The Third Squad of the Pingjiang Public Office Security Team stationed nearby rushed to suppress the situation and detained four people, all of whom sustained serious injuries, including Chen Linggen, Chen Asi, Chen Shaozhou, and Qian Bulin. Chen Linggen's axe wound to the back of the head was about four inches long and half an inch deep, turning him into a bloody mess. Chen Asi had a knife wound on his lower back, sustained during the first brawl at 9:00 PM the night before last. The wound was about six inches long and more than half an inch deep. Chen Shaozhou had obvious iron rod injuries on his right waist ribs, with internal bruising. Qian Bulin also had bruises all over his body. The team, believing the incident to be under the jurisdiction of the police, immediately notified the Tanzihou Police Station of the situation. The police station dispatched officers to the station with the injured individuals and sent them to the Xinzha Branch. The branch ordered that the injured be sent to Pushen Hospital for treatment first. Around noon, the reporter went to investigate and saw Chen Linggen still lying on the cement floor in the surgical examination room of the hospital, wearing a blue cloth shirt and white pants, a bloody sight that was unbearable to witness. According to Dr. Wu Guozhou, there was excessive bleeding, and the pulse was weak. A life-saving injection was immediately administered, along with gauze to stop the bleeding and bandaging. It was uncertain whether his life could be saved. Later investigation revealed that the cause of the incident was that around 9:00 PM the night before last, Chen Asi was pulling a rickshaw home when he saw a gangster engaged in an ambiguous situation with a young woman. Asi boldly exposed the adultery, which led to the fight.

### Pacific Hurricane Approaches Shantou Yesterday

Direction: Northwest or North-Northwest; Yesterday's Heat Intensified Greatly in This City

According to the Astronomical Observatory's report yesterday afternoon, the Pacific hurricane, after crossing Luzon Island and heading towards the southern coast of China, had advanced to within sixty nautical miles of 23 degrees north latitude and 117 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. This meant it had approached the coast of Shantou, and the situation was becoming increasingly tense. The direction of the hurricane was northwest or north-northwest. The wind force was unknown. Yesterday's weather in this city was extremely hot. According to the Astronomical Observatory's records, before 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the highest temperature in this city rose to 94.1 degrees, setting the second-highest record of the year, second only to the temperature on the seventh day of last month (Note: The temperature on the seventh day of last month was 97.2 degrees). Therefore, residents were enduring the suffering of being in a furnace, unable to bear the intense heat. The number of epidemic patients seeking treatment at various epidemic hospitals also suddenly increased yesterday.

### Two Thieves Arrested Yesterday for Robbery at Fulong Leather Workshop on Zhongxing Road

Around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Min Gensheng, the team leader of the Seventh Squad stationed in the city center of the City Police Bureau's Detective General Team, along with Foreman Cao Junda, Detectives Miao Yizhong, Tao Jinsen, Deng Jiagen, and others, in conjunction with the Xinzha Branch, arrested the two members of the robbery gang, Wang Xiaoerzi (also known as Dalinzi, also known as Tang Jianting) and Huan Danianzi, at No. 16, Lane 79, Jiaotong Road. They confessed to the robbery at No. 2767, Zhongxing Road Fulong Leather Workshop, without denying anything.

### Seven People Arrested in Acid Attack Case on Foreigner

Case Cracked Nearly Half a Year After the Incident; Complex Details, Hearing Postponed

Nox, a western inspector at the Shanghai Waterworks Company on O'Ka Road, was overly strict in managing workers, causing widespread anger and resentment. On December 28th of last year, at 9:50 PM, while returning home from the factory, he hired a rickshaw. While traveling near Diswei Road on O'Ka Road, he was suddenly stopped by several thugs, who threw nitric acid at his face. Upon achieving their goal, the thugs fled in all directions. Nox was injured and sought treatment at the Public Hospital. The most severe damage was to his eyes, resulting in blindness and being incurable. The various police stations failed to find the culprits, and the case had been shelved. Recently, Chinese Detective Yang Bizheng, Yuan Xinzhong, and Detective Li Yinmin of the Jiaxing Road Police Station arrested seven people in the Chinese Concession and Inter-Settlement Zone who were the actual perpetrators of the attack: Tan Fusheng from Jiangbei, who carried out the attack; and Zhu Derong, Shi Along, Zhao Zhilin, Gao Jinlong, Zhu Guozhi, and Pan Honggen, who instigated the crime. They were arrested along with suspects Shen Chunsheng, Zhu Wenliang, and Feng Zhaocai, and sent to the First Special Court for detailed investigation. The leader, named Da Wuzi, was also wanted. Yesterday, Judge Dai Rongduo presided over the preliminary hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated that the case needed to be reviewed to determine that Shen Chunsheng, Zhu Wenliang, and Feng Zhaocai were not involved and should be released. The court granted the request and stated that the case was complex and requested a postponement of the hearing. Judge Dai ordered that the defendants be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for Wednesday. The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gang, Ma Lehong, and Shen Xingxia, all complied with the order and withdrew.

### Zhao Zhidian Commits Suicide After Fiancé Arrives Late

Severely Poisoned, Life in Danger

Zhao Zhidian, a woman from Zhejiang, lived at No. 66, Mingde Lane, Fuxu Road. Her fiancé, Mr. Gu, was a student at Jiaotong University. Recently, Mr. Gu's love for Zhao Zhidian had waned. Yesterday, Sunday, Zhao invited Mr. Gu to her house at 1:00 PM to go out together, but Mr. Gu did not arrive until 5:00 PM. This caused Zhao to have an argument with her fiancé, and they parted on bad terms. Afterwards, Zhao Zhidian secretly took a large amount of sleeping pills in her bedroom to commit suicide. She was discovered by her family and immediately taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It was said that she was severely poisoned and her life was in danger.

He lived with his elderly mother and wife at No. 7, Runsuinan Lane, Huanghe Road, in the French Concession. Recently, due to financial difficulties, he resorted to selling the drug heroin to support his mother and wife. On the morning of the first day of this month, at 9:00 AM, Pu bought heroin from a Korean named Jia at No. 3, Lane 245, Malong Road, and was returning home when he was seen acting suspiciously by Chinese Police Officer No. 578 at the entrance of the lane.

### Lawsuit Against Accountant for Breach of Trust After Debt Claim is Cancelled

Plaintiff Demands Compensation of Two Hundred Yuan; Court Orders Li Ding to Appear in Court for a Retrial

After the Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory Co., Ltd. declared bankruptcy last year, the First Special Court appointed accountant Li Ding as the bankruptcy administrator, and the creditor group publicly elected Zhou Baokang and Liu Huchen as bankruptcy supervisors. Recently, Lu Jiasheng filed a criminal complaint with the First Special Court against Li, Zhou, and Liu, accusing them of joint breach of trust, requesting their summons, and attaching a private prosecution. The reason for the prosecution was that the plaintiff, Lu Jiasheng, held a judgment from this court, case number Yi 1646 of the 25th year, which had been finalized. On November 28th of the 25th year, he registered the claim with the accountant Li Ding's office, which was approved, and a registration certificate was issued. He subsequently received repeated notices to attend conciliation and creditors' meetings. Zhou and Liu were the bankruptcy supervisors of Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, and their task was to protect legitimate debt claims, and they bore joint responsibility. However, on June 10th, he suddenly received a notice from accountant Li Ding stating, "You have registered a deposit claim of five hundred yuan. According to the supervisor's report, the funds you registered were not deposits but shares. Since they are shares, they cannot be registered as a debt claim and should be canceled." The plaintiff immediately replied, stating that the supervisors had no right to change the court's finalized legal judgment and requesting that the date for receiving payment be specified to finalize the matter (each person would first receive 40% of the debt claim). However, the defendants ignored the letter and jointly insisted on canceling the plaintiff's debt claim, which was a clear violation of their duties. The defendants distributed the debt amount on May 22nd, giving out four shares of the public fund, without publishing a public announcement, violating Article 139, Section 3 of the Bankruptcy Law and Article 342 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, he was prosecuting and attaching a private prosecution, requesting a judgment ordering them to repay the plaintiff the portion of the Jingfeng bankruptcy estate that should be distributed in advance, 40%, totaling two hundred yuan in national currency, as well as the legal delay interest until the date of enforcement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai summoned the defendants. Li Ding did not attend because he was in Beiping for business, and he appointed a lawyer to represent him. Zhou Baokang and Liu Huchen both appeared in court and stated that based on the debt claim report, the plaintiff's funds were shares, not deposits. Therefore, they proposed that accountant Li cancel his debt claim. This procedure was entirely to protect debt claims and was not for selfish gain. The court decided to postpone the case until the 22nd and ordered Li Ding to appear in court for a retrial.

### Labor Dispute at Silk Factories in Zhabei District, Social Affairs Bureau Mediates This Morning

Party and Government Representatives Urge Resumption of Work Unsuccessfully; Change to Production-Based System Not Yet Approved

Workers at fourteen silk factories in Zhabei District, including Fuchang, went on strike to protest the factory's implementation of a production-based system, and presented eight demands. After receiving a petition from worker representatives, the municipal Party and government authorities urged the workers to resume work first to maintain production. A meeting to mediate between labor and management regarding the demands was scheduled for this morning. The details are as follows:

Urging Resumption of Work

After the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs received a petition from worker representatives of fourteen silk factories, including Fuchang, and presented eight demands for improved treatment, the bureau, in order to resolve the labor dispute as soon as possible, earnestly instructed the petitioning representatives to persuade the workers to resume work first. It also dispatched officials, along with representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, to persuade all male and female workers to return to work as usual. As for the disputed issues, mediation would be conducted in accordance with the law. However, the workers insisted on canceling the production-based system and implementing improved treatment before resuming work. As of last night, the labor dispute remained in a stalemate.

Mediation This Morning

The Party and government authorities believed that it was unfortunate that the silk factories had suddenly changed to a production-based system shortly after resuming operations, causing worker opposition and strikes. In order to quickly resolve the issue, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs scheduled a meeting for 10:00 AM today, convening representatives from the Silk Factory Owners' Association and the Sixth District Silk Industry Workers' Union for mediation. At the same time, the Fourth and Sixth District Silk Workers' Unions were instructed to earnestly persuade the factories that had not yet gone on strike to continue working as usual and not to initiate labor disputes without authorization, so as to avoid escalating the conflict.

Production-Based System

Silk factory workers' wages were originally calculated on a daily basis. This year, due to the poor spring cocoon harvest, the income of various factories was insufficient to sustain operations until the autumn cocoon season. Therefore, a production-based system was implemented. Compared to the previous daily wage calculation, the workers suffered significant losses, and the compensation for their all-day labor was barely enough to make a living. Therefore, they unanimously expressed their opposition. The current Party and government authorities believed that the factory's change to a production-based system had not been submitted to the competent authorities for approval beforehand, and they could not arbitrarily change the compensation method. They decided to investigate and stop the implementation.

### Korean Drug Den Busted, Chinese Man Sentenced to Eight Years

Chen Yulin Only Hired to Solicit Customers – National Law Strict, Fellow Citizens Should Be Vigilant

On the afternoon of the 24th of last month, at 5:00 PM, Chinese Detective Jin Haibo of the Hongkou Police Station, in collaboration with Japanese patrol officers, busted a Korean (named Wu Xuanhao) drug-selling operation at No. 7, Lane 97, Haining Road, confiscating 105 small bags and one large bag of heroin. Wu was immediately arrested, along with a Chinese man, Chen Yulin, and taken to the police station. The Korean was handed over to the Japanese Consulate for processing, while Chen was sent to the First Special District Court. Chen firmly denied the charges. The court ordered him remanded in custody pending the appearance of the Korean to testify. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei came to the Third Criminal Court to continue the trial. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested that the Korean, Wu Xuanhao, be brought to court to testify, as he could prove that Chen Yulin was hired to solicit customers for five jiao a day. This was the truth. When questioned, the defendant still denied the charges, claiming he had not ingested any of the drugs. His remaining testimony was evasive. Judge Xiao appointed a lawyer to defend him pro bono, and then sentenced Chen Yulin to eight years imprisonment as a warning.

### Workers Assault Western Detectives, Sentenced to Imprisonment

Four Sentenced to Six Months, Three to Thirty Days of Detention

At the China Soap Factory at No. 230 Yangshupu Road, around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, the factory announced changes to the original retirement and pension benefits. All the workers were dissatisfied and immediately went on strike, creating a serious situation. The Yangshupu Police Station received a report and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the unrest. The workers resisted and, as a result, used bricks and mud to injure Western Detective Duke and Western Police Officer Smith, both heads of the Third Road team. The police immediately arrested eight workers, including Chen Daobiao, Ye Qingyou, Chen Ruqing, and suspect Wang Jinsheng, along with the bricks and soil, and took them into custody. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the police sent Chen Daobiao and the others to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them on charges of disrupting order and assaulting public officials, detailing the case's events and requesting punishment. Judge Xiao Xiefei interrogated each defendant, finding the facts clear, and sentenced Chen Daobiao, Ye Qingyou, Cui Jiaping, and Tang Liukun to six months imprisonment each. Chen Ruqing, Li Asan, and Cai Youfu were each sentenced to thirty days detention. If converted to a fine, it would be at the rate of two yuan per day. Wang Jinsheng was released.

### Four Robbers Armed, One Arrested on the Spot

Xu Fujin Remanded in Custody Pending Investigation of Accomplices

The robber, Xu Fujin, from Pudong, along with four accomplices still at large, used weapons to rob the resident Cao Haisheng at No. 3 Oujia Road of gold rings and ornaments worth sixty yuan on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 8:00 PM. They fled the scene, but were intercepted by Chinese Detective Xu Yongyuan, Detective Chen Ruisheng, and Chinese Police Officer No. 841, who arrived after being alerted. Xu, in desperation, opened fire to resist arrest, but was ultimately apprehended, along with a pistol and three bullets. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan requested an extension to investigate and apprehend the accomplices. Judge Dai Rongduo ordered him remanded in custody for further review at a later date.

### Gatekeeper Beaten to Death by Three Workers

Fan Guoqing, 22, from Shaoxing, Liu Quanquan, 24, and Jin Asan, 20, all workers at the Dazhong Military Clothing Factory on Hengpai Bridge, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, were young and restless. On the evening of the 17th of last month, they went out to eat snacks and wander around. When they returned to the factory late at night, the gatekeeper, Liu Wanyuan, refused to open the gate due to factory rules. Fan and the others were furious and forced the gate open. Without asking any questions, they punched and kicked Liu Wanyuan, causing fatal injuries. The factory immediately turned the three offenders over to the police station, which transferred them to the District Court. The prosecutor confirmed that the deceased had died from a ruptured intestine caused by kicking. The three offenders were charged with public assault. Yesterday, Judge Chen opened the trial. The defendants claimed that they did not lay a hand on him and that the deceased had fallen to his death. The court ordered an adjournment to summon witnesses for further questioning.

### Wang Xiangtai Entices a Remarried Woman

Defendant Denies the Incident, Court Adjourns for Further Inquiry

Wang Fengyou, a young widow from Anhui, had lived with her husband in Hangzhou. Her husband passed away from illness in the spring of the 24th year of the Republic. As a young widow, lonely and heartbroken, she met Wang Puyue, a middle-aged widower from the same village who was looking for someone to manage his household. He proposed to her, and she accepted. They married in December of that year, each finding what they needed. They shared the same interests and got along well. Later, Wang took her to live in Ningbo. On April 1st of this year, Wang asked Wang Fengyou to return to their hometown with his friends, Fan Qingyuan and others, because he had important business to attend to. On April 2nd, they arrived in Shanghai and stayed at the Detai shipping ticket agency in Shiliupu to buy boat tickets. There, they met Wang Xiangtai, a 27-year-old man from the same village. Seeing that she was attractive and assuming her family was not around, he attempted to seduce her, colluding with Zhou Shangwen, Huang Paosong, and others. While Fan Qingyuan was out, they lured Wang Fengyou to Zhou Shangwen's house, employing all sorts of tricks. Wang Fengyou fell for their scheme and forgot about her husband. Her affairs were entirely managed by Wang Xiangtai, who even hired a lawyer to publish a notice declaring her separation from Wang Puyue. They believed that Wang Fengyou, as a remarried woman, was not bound by any legal constraints due to the lack of a marriage certificate. When Fan Qingyuan returned, Wang Fengyou was gone. After searching without success, he consulted Zhang Jianmou, who revealed the secret. Fan Qingyuan then returned to Ningbo and brought Wang Puyue to Shanghai to report the incident to the police, who arrested Wang, Zhou, and Huang. However, Wang Fengyou's whereabouts were unknown. The prosecutor initially dismissed the case against the defendants, but after the plaintiff requested a retrial, prosecutor Lei Binzhang investigated and determined that Wang Puyue and Wang Fengyou were married. Therefore, the three defendants were prosecuted for enticing a married woman. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the trial. The plaintiff, in an attached civil suit, demanded that the defendants return his wife and pay damages of one hundred yuan. The defendants denied the facts. The court adjourned for further inquiry.

### Girl Injured by Train Wheel While Standing on Rail Ties

At the Rihuigang Station in South Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, a girl, about eight or nine years old with a Shandong accent, was standing and playing on the rail ties.

She fainted and was sent to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment.

### Old North Gate Police Station's Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce

Defending the Detention of Informants

The Old North Gate Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the matter of police agencies detaining informants, stating: "To the esteemed Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, we were greatly surprised to read the article published on the 19th of this month regarding your Chamber's petition to the Municipal Government to order police agencies not to detain informants. The article is far from the truth. On September 4th, 1936, this station, based on a report from Police Officer Du Yunpeng of Post No. 6, arrested Huang Wangyun, a representative of the Umbrella Industry Union, on Fuyou Road. Huang accused the Global Umbrella Factory of violating union regulations by unjustly dismissing four workers—Sun Guodang, Ni Ganggen, Zheng Jinlin, and Qian Guisheng—and suspending their meals. The duty officer, Hu Chongmin, investigated the matter and found that the dispute between the Global Factory representative, Chen Dingbang, and the union representative, Huang Wangyun, and the worker Sun Guofu, was a labor-management dispute without any violent clashes. Subsequently, the Umbrella Industry Association and the Umbrella Industry Workers' Union sent letters, each claiming to be in the right and stating that they had separately petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters for resolution. This station believed that since both parties had already petitioned Party and government agencies, it should wait for a resolution. The station immediately ordered Huang Wangyun to take the workers Sun Guofu and the others back and forbade them from causing trouble at the factory. Both parties expressed satisfaction and left. Afterward, the station sent personnel to mediate between labor and management. As a result, the factory paid the workers their wages (up to the date of dismissal) and an additional fifty yuan as travel expenses for Sun Guofu and the other four workers to return to their hometowns. The labor-management dispute was quickly resolved. This station handled the case from beginning to end without detaining the plaintiff or the informant. The original article's claim that 'the reporter must accompany the person to the station to await transfer to the bureau the next day, otherwise the matter cannot be handled' is simply untrue. Furthermore, this station has always strived to mediate labor-management disputes based on the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, avoiding any rupture. As in the handling of this case, it was resolved quickly without the direct intervention of higher-level Party and government agencies. If we had simply listened to one side of the story and strictly pursued the dismissed workers, we fear that the situation would have escalated, with both sides taking extreme measures, resulting in even greater losses for both. Your Chamber, as the highest organization of commercial groups in this city, should impartially investigate the truth of the matter between labor and management, upholding the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, and avoiding any remarks that unnecessarily provoke the emotions of either side, leading to mutual destruction. You should also maintain a sincere attitude towards local political agencies. If there are any misunderstandings, they should be discussed openly and the facts examined. Matters should not be decided based on preconceived notions without examining the facts and the circumstances of the authorities' handling of the case. Although the petition that your Chamber disclosed in the newspaper was merely a factual report without any intention of attacking or opposing the police agencies, the original text contained a request to severely punish the defendants, which exposed your Chamber's preconceived notions and provoked the emotions of the workers. Before investigating the truth of the case's handling with this station, your Chamber was unaware of the station's mediation efforts and, based on only one side of the story, criticized this station for failing to severely punish the defendants. This discrepancy from the truth is a cause of concern for this station, which cannot remain silent. Therefore, we have submitted a report to the higher authorities detailing the handling of this case, from beginning to end, for their review. We are also informing your Chamber of the details of our handling of the case for your reference. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."

### Shanghai Warehouses Begin Flood Defense Measures

Waterproof Equipment Installed Separately, Six Shipping Companies Urge Collection of Warehouse Goods

To prepare for the autumn flood season, the banks' warehouses and the shipping companies' docks in this port have been constructing flood defenses in the cargo holds since two years ago, specifically for the autumn flood season. The construction involves a base of cement, topped with wood pilings, and wooden planks laid on top, about two to three feet above the ground. Goods are stacked on top of the wooden planks to prevent damage from flooding, making it extremely safe. This year, the above-mentioned flood defense equipment has already begun to be installed. Furthermore, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, Ning Shao, Nissin and other six shipping companies have not only installed the aforementioned flood defense equipment, but also issued notices to cargo owners to collect their goods. The notice states: "Regarding the matter of issuing this notice, from this day forward, this company and other companies own or rent all the warehouses. If the cargo that each cargo owner has already stacked or is about to stack is damaged by flooding, this company and other companies will not be responsible for compensation. However, we will do our best to prevent disasters. Any special expenses incurred shall be paid by each cargo owner in full when the goods are shipped."

### Red Swastika Society Plans to Establish Orphanages for Gansu Disaster Children

Chairmen Xiong Xiling and Zhao Daozi Each Commit to Funding One Orphanage

The drought-stricken area in Gansu this time is vast, accounting for nearly eight or nine-tenths of the province by county. More than three million people have been affected. Spring planting was missed, and a harvest in the autumn is hopeless. If relief is not provided urgently, they will all end up as corpses in ditches. However, since the province is located on the frontier and the journey is long, donors from all parties have paid more attention to disaster areas in Henan and other provinces, with little attention to this area. What is even more tragic is that countless disaster-stricken children are displaced, without food or clothing, crying out in the wilderness. The situation is unbearable to witness. In light of this, the World Red Swastika Society has decided to establish two orphanages in Gansu, each housing 100 disaster-stricken children for a period of one year. The cost is set at 2,000 yuan per orphanage per year. Chairmen Xiong Xiling and Zhao Daozi have each committed to funding one orphanage. It is said that they have already raised 2,000 yuan each by saving on snacks and sweets for their nephews, nieces, and other young relatives and friends. The funds have been allocated to Commissioner Zhu Ziqiao, who has been asked to select suitable people to establish the orphanages in the province immediately. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life who are committed to the welfare of children will pay more attention.

In addition, the society has already allocated 3,000 yuan for urgent relief in Gansu. However, it has repeatedly received telegrams from Luo Miaoguan, the head of the Gansu Relief Commissioner, stating that the disaster area is vast and that the amount is insufficient for distribution. It is now heard that the General Association and the Shanghai General Office have added another 3,000 yuan to be remitted to Gansu. A circular has also been sent to all associations, calling for unified fundraising to continue providing relief.

### Caojiadu Police Station Cracks Down on Cold Drinks and Sleeping in the Open

Yesterday the weather suddenly turned hot. Various cold drinks have gone on sale in the Caojiadu area of ​​West Shanghai. Many of the residents in the vicinity are poor, and they all sleep on the sides of the road at night. The police station in charge believes that this is not only unhygienic but also unsightly. Therefore, the Caojiadu Police Branch specially sent long-term police officers to patrol the various roads. Unclean cold drink stalls and food shops are cracked down on and given guidance. At the same time, it is strictly ordered that all equipment such as fly-proof screens must be added to emphasize hygiene. Public nudity and sleeping on the roadside at night are subject to strict prohibition.

### Nanyang Hospital Adds Second Branch in Xiaodongmen

The Xiaodongmen Nanyang Hospital in this city was founded by Mr. Gu Nanqun, a well-known physician in Shanghai. It has been around for 20 years. Mr. Gu founded the Nanyang Medical College many years ago and is an advanced figure in the medical field. In the past four or five years, he has shaken off his responsibilities at the school and has devoted all his energy to the hospital. All of the hospital's main diagnostic instruments, such as X-ray machines, short-wave diathermy machines, and high-intensity microscopes, are the latest and most complete medical equipment. The hospital is divided into departments such as internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics, physical therapy, and plastic surgery, and employs experienced male and female doctors to take charge of each department's diagnostic responsibilities. Recently, due to the inadequacy of the hospital building in Xiaodongmen, a second branch has been added at Nos. 14-22, Tiantangdong Street, Huangjiadu, Nanshi. The area is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, and the air is fresh, making it ideal for recuperation. It is truly good news for patients in Nanshi.

### Selling Oxen

By Yijiaqian

A Taizhou dispatch on the 3rd: Recently, cattle dealers have flocked to various townships and markets in Wenling to sell oxen for export, in large numbers, causing ox prices to soar. Ignorant farmers, greedy for temporary profits, are selling off their oxen in droves. According to a recent survey, more than 1,000 heads have been sold in less than a month. The county government, recognizing the situation, will reportedly order strict prohibitions in all districts to avoid affecting agricultural cultivation next year.

Farmers are children of the earth, and they rely on the land for food. From their ancestors to their fathers to themselves, they will pass it down to their children and grandchildren in the future. The land is their home; sometimes it is even more important than their home. Anyone close to rural areas knows this is the truth. There is a saying in the countryside called "relying on heaven for food", which is actually an explanation of "relying on the land for food", because with land, you still have to rely on the help of the weather. In recent years, "heaven" seems to have become the enemy of people in the countryside. Droughts and water shortages have followed one after another. Farmers who live by the "earth" have worked hard all year, but have ended up with nothing, which is also a well-known fact. However, this is "heaven's will". They still treasure the land as much as their own lives. When a new year begins, they work hard at spring plowing and summer weeding again.

Oxen are helpers that assist them in farming. They are as loyal and hardworking as the farmers themselves. During rice planting, they pull the heavy plow, turning the land over step by step, allowing the rice roots left over from the previous year to become rich fertilizer. In the summer, when the seedlings dance like green waves in the fields, they help with irrigation day and night. During the autumn harvest, they transport the grain. They and their masters both work hard on the earth all year round. The master also loves and cares for them, feeding them with fodder and sheltering them in the cowshed. When they are not working in the fields, they are always allowed to rest well and recover from past fatigue.

In the eyes of farmers, this good helper is also more important than their own lives.

But now the farmers in Wenling are "selling off their oxen in droves." Half of the reason is naturally because "ox prices are soaring," and it is always cost-effective to earn a few more yuan. However, this is also a phenomenon of rural bankruptcy. They really have nothing of value left to exchange for money. Even if it is a good helper, they have to "reluctantly part with" it. "In less than a month, more than 1,000 heads have been sold." I don't know how the masters of these 1,000 or so heads are feeling. I am afraid that they are as sad as those who "exchange children to eat" (desperate people eating each other's children during famine). I am also the son of a farmer, and I have personally witnessed a farmer refusing to sell his dying ox to a butcher (also a type of cattle dealer). He said, "It helped me my whole life, and it should be allowed to die well. I don't care about these few yuan?" This shows the farmers' love for the oxen.

However, now that they are "selling off their oxen in droves" because "ox prices are soaring," it can be seen how poor those people in the countryside are. As for the county government "ordering strict prohibitions in all districts to avoid affecting agricultural cultivation next year", naturally it is also "rightfully justified". However, when those "hereditary" farmers are willing to sell off even the oxen that they rely on for life, it should also be known that "singing" (empty words) is of no help to the facts. The situation needs to be clearly and thoroughly examined to see how this phenomenon was created, and then take concrete action to "do"!

### A Preemptive Plea

— Wei Sheng

Let's start by clipping a few news items to take a look at:

Guihua: Continuous torrential rain in Huanjing for days, the Yellow River's water level has suddenly risen by two or three feet to seven or eight feet, and the rising trend continues. Farmland along the river in Linhe and Baotou counties in western Suiyuan has been largely inundated. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 27th)

Fuzhou: The provincial capital suffered from the downpour of mountain torrents, developing into an unprecedented flood. More than thirty villages in the first district of Minhou County have already declared their harvest to be completely hopeless. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 28th)

Hangzhou: The dikes of the Fangji Yutang and Migong Lakes have collapsed, and the Dongmi River has also breached its banks, making it impossible to reinforce them. 200,000 mu of riverfront fields have been flooded. (Special dispatch from the 27th)

Beiping: According to a phone call from Lugouqiao, heavy rain has been falling in the Suiyuan and Chahar regions for days, causing mountain torrents to erupt. The Yongding River rose sharply by one foot and five inches this morning, and another five inches in the afternoon. By evening, the water level had reached a total of one zhang, four chi, and five cun, with a continued rising trend. The current is turbulent, carrying an extremely large amount of sediment. (Special dispatch from the 28th)

Huaiyin: The Canal (transport water) has risen by more than four chi, and the trend shows no sign of stopping. (Special dispatch from the 28th)

Jinan: The Yellow River has risen again. Today, the water level at Luokou has reached 30 meters, 3 cun, and 3 fen. (Special dispatch from the 28th)

Enemy attacks are emerging one after another, while the eagerly awaited "united salvation" remains a mere rumor. The people of the whole country are trapped in a continuous cycle of disasters. Before the drought is over, floods are about to descend on a large scale. Those who don't die from drought will die from floods. Those tossed and turned in the cracked earth are simultaneously destined to be swept away by the waters. Our consistently unlucky compatriots are, it seems, once again destined to have a "disaster year" this year!

This year's drought, its widespread geographical reach and the severity of the disaster, are enough to make one tremble upon hearing of it. Take Sichuan as an example: there are over a hundred counties in Sichuan affected by the disaster. At the beginning of the "disaster situation disclosure," there were people urgently seeking assistance, requesting the central government to issue public bonds, and initiating fundraising campaigns. After meetings and calculations, it was finally reported that there was a "disaster relief fund" of "fifteen million." However, a full three months passed, and only fourteen counties received this "relief fund"! But it seemed as if it had been prearranged: following the propaganda that these fourteen counties had "received relief funds," it was first successively spread that "the entire province of Sichuan joyfully received timely rain," that "Sichuan has hopes for a good autumn harvest this year," and even that "Sichuan received rain, and the farmers were overjoyed"... In this way, people were "calmed," making them believe that "Sichuan farmers are no longer impoverished." Then, they proceeded to "begin collecting" the land tax three times a year.

Now, a major flood is coming: the land that is about to be affected by the disaster or has already been "disastered" includes a series of provinces such as Suiyuan (already affected), Fujian (already affected), Zhejiang (already affected), Hebei, Jiangsu, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong. There are also reports of the Yangtze River having "high water levels"!

Of course, when it comes to floods, the current situation is that "river water levels are higher than in the same period in previous years, but have not yet reached the major flood season," and "although there are localized floods caused by mountain torrents, they have not yet developed into major disasters." However, this is already enough to make us twelve thousand times afraid: the "example" tells us that after "not yet" (when "focusing on work is of utmost importance"), there will be a "sudden arrival" (this time, after the alarming announcement of the sudden arrival, there will be "donations and allocations," and after "donations and allocations," there will often be "silent disappearance").... But it is said that modern times cannot do without "new expectations," so I would like to make a preemptive plea here: when it is "not yet," I hope that "prevention" is "strict"; after "being disastered," I hope that "relief efforts" are quick; if, unfortunately, a major disaster occurs, and the butchers who specialize in taking advantage of the situation rise up, I hope that the important figures in the government and the public can still take a little interest in these matters!

### One Night in Grimm

— Shi Si

Spending a "Day and Night Festival" in Grimm planted seeds of melancholy in our hearts.

The next day, when we packed up our tents and luggage to leave, it wasn't the scorching southern sun that had exhausted us, but rather we were all listless and unable to muster any energy. Occasionally, I would steal a glance at the red-rimmed eyes of the Grimm girls who were helping to pack things up next to me, and my own eyes couldn't help but turn red.

"Farewell, Grimm, farewell, kind girls!"

With our luggage slung over our shoulders, our group of travelers began to move forward again. The girls walked alongside us, silently, with tears welling up in their eyes. The warm sunshine could no longer warm our hearts. The beautiful scenery no longer attracted our attention.

"Go back, darlings, we'll still come back in the not-too-distant future!" (A lie!)

The girls finally stopped on the hills of Grimm, staring at us with their tear-filled eyes. Then, like hysterics, we hugged each other warmly and gave each other a long, melancholy kiss.

"Farewell, Grimm, girls, when will we meet again!"

We lowered our heads and took slow steps, constantly turning back to look at the asphalt hills. On the hills stood the beautiful, passionate... Grimm girls.

"Deep affection, deep coconut grove, deeper still, the sky is high and the road is far, ah,

…"

We all fell into the dreamlike reverie of the Grimm "Day and Night Festival" from last night.

Last night was on the grassland behind the hills.

The Grimm people were celebrating the "Day and Night Festival" on the grassland. All the Grimm men and women who enjoyed revelry gathered on the grassland. The men all wore newly made cloths, and the girls' beautiful aprons were adorned with flowers. Their magnificent chests were also tied with bright red, seductive ribbons. Everyone sat together on the grassland, laughing and rejoicing to their hearts' content. Coconuts, bananas, rambutan fruits, and mild homemade red wine... were scattered all over the ground.

We participated in the Grimm people's "Day and Night Festival." This "Day and Night Festival" is held every full moon night.

The strings of the qin were plucked, and the leather drums were gently tapped. Everyone stood up, and the men danced folk dances with the women they were fond of. The men who didn't have a special girl also extended their hands to the single girls, and we also extended our hands to the single girls.

The strings of the qin were plucked even faster, making a hoarse, but very intoxicating sound.

The wild dancing ended, and the fruits and red wine... dwindled. The men and their beloved women all left the grassland and went to the dark coconut grove to relax. My companions also successively left the grassland with the girls.

"Let's take a walk, girl!" We also left the grassland. I held her soft waist, and her head rested on my shoulder as we slowly walked towards the dark coconut grove. The moonlight fell sparsely, reflecting her brown face. She was enchantingly beautiful. I held her tighter, even tighter! We turned into a small path. The coconut grove was very dense, and we were almost completely in the dark. She leaned very close to me. But soon, we walked out of the dark forest and sat down on a large rock by the stream.

The moonlight was brighter, and the stream flowed slowly and silently, shimmering with specks of silver waves. The grassland stretched out endlessly. The gentle breeze pushed and swayed the bluish-white waves of grass. The coconut trees also exuded a fresh fragrance - the night was beautiful.

I held her in my arms and lay down. My blood was surging. Oh, Grimm girl, I love you! In the moonlight, she was even more beautiful, like a sacred female statue. Every part of her stirred my heart.

"Darling, sing a Grimm song!"

She sang:

Deep affection, deep coconut grove, deeper still,

The sky is high and the road is far, ah,

Unbreakable, unshatterable love,

The coconut trees are in bloom,

You must come back, ah,

Don't let Magingnn bewitch your heart,

The moon...

The song suddenly stopped, and she sobbed in my arms.

A kind of pain suddenly gnawed at my heart. I lowered my head: the moonlight shone on the tears on her face. She opened her big eyes and looked at me as if with infinite pleading.

"You are magnificent!" Suddenly, she struggled up and tightly embraced and kissed me. Our tears mingled. A kind of passionate comfort and distress pricked at my heart.

It was very late when I returned to my tent. I couldn't sleep all night. I thought of that passionate Grimm girl, and I also thought of that girl in Mitaretka.

All night, the tent was filled with the sound of turning over. Oh, the Grimm "Day and Night Festival"!

### River Bathing

— You Qi

——Mountain Travel Miscellany

The people watching the spectacle dispersed from the public office, splitting into several groups. One group went to the fields in the mountains, and another group went back to their homes along the old road. Among these, our group was the thinnest, with only Lao Tie and me, following the grass that covered our feet, heading aimlessly into the distance.

The path we were walking on could be said to be: "untapped virgin land," the wild grasses all standing straight and tall

. There were no visible footprints. The flowers, of various sizes, watched this unfamiliar journey with startled eyes.

As we walked, we reached the riverbank.

The river itself was not wide, but it was as clear as a mirror. If you made a funny face, that funny face would be clearly reflected in the water. The clouds flowed brightly across the sky, and what appeared in the mirror would naturally be no different. Perhaps this is the origin of the name Yunlang River? I thought.

The water was too lovely: emerald green. A sip of it was sweet. Countless stones of various sizes stood upright in the water. The river swirled between the stones, as if with some attachment, playing out solitary tunes in each swirl. Gone, not allowing it to linger any longer! What about the swimming fish? As if sitting on an engine with many horsepower, they didn't need to worry themselves, following the powerful current, sometimes kissing the green moss on the stones or the water plants at the bottom of the river, vaguely letting life wander into the distance.

Due to the vigor of the water quality, the reeds on the riverbank were four or five chi high, intermittent, like natural lanes.

This place was not very close to the main street we had come from. The sounds of the street could not be heard. Apart from the singing of birds and insects, there was only the rare ending of a mountain song, distant and faint, indistinguishable in its words, as if separated by many mountains.

Lao Tie took off his vest and shorts, letting his strong muscles bask in the sunset, and raised his hand to me - "Come on! Such a good pool, let's take a bath first." He stood on a stone, untied the towel wrapped around his head to wipe sweat, and began to shower.

——"Be careful that women don't walk by and it looks indecent!" I warned him: "Maybe you'll be dragged into the public office and charged with harming public morals!"

He laughed, his black face and white teeth particularly distinct in the sunlight. "That's fine too, I'll report it after the fact, and grab her to 'harm her morals' twice!" He laughed very innocently.

Finally, I also went into the water, but I was still not very bold. The mountain stones, more than one person tall, served as our natural screen. Our clothes hung on the jagged corners of the stones. No matter which side a woman passed by, we would be able to "hide."

Bathing and bathing. Suddenly, an extremely shrill tune swept across the sky, like the roar of Tarzan the Ape Man -

I said, my sister!

In the hot days of May and June,

My dear brother's heart is like being fried in oil!…

In the distance, a person walked out of the opposite paddy field, estimated to be less than thirty years old, his whole body was purple-brown, and his private parts were covered with something. He ran over anxiously following the bright singing, looking like he had some kind of appointment. Immediately, we all hid, waiting to see how things would develop.

The man's singing gradually faded and subsided. As if unwilling to let this tense scene remain still, an echo rose from the reeds five or six zhang away from us, sharp, delicate, it was a woman's tune -

Waiting for my love among the weeds,

Watching the sun rise over the mountain ridge…

The singing below turned into a fast rhythm, and the words became blurred. This was a living comedy. Due to the authenticity of the performance, I then became aware of the situations in legends and records. After all, Lao Tie was young and a bit childish. He didn't let my thoughts continue, so he gathered all his voice, clapped his hands, and shouted wildly.

This gave them an unexpected and enormous shock. Unlike when they came, they were lazy. The man first turned and ran, and the woman also jumped out of the reeds and ran away for dear life. They did not take the same path. In the blink of an eye, they had all disappeared.

The setting sun on the mountain ridge left some traces. The wild assault, perhaps, will have sown endless curses?

### Stories

Xing Junming, "Anecdotes of Chinese and Foreign Celebrities," Dong Lu (800), 12:40 PM to 1:15 PM

"Consort Fei"

Waiting until the fifth watch to rush to the front hall, personally ringing the bell to summon the officials, intending for the ministers to die for the country together, but not one came. He sighed, "I have not treated the scholars poorly, but now that it has come to this, why is it that not a single minister will follow me?" After speaking, he wrote on the corner of his robe: "I, with my deficient virtue and humble body, have offended Heaven, yet it is all due to the misguidance of my ministers. I die without face to meet my ancestors. I remove my crown and cover my face with my hair, allowing the bandits to dismember me, so that not a single commoner is harmed." After Emperor Sizong finished writing, he went to the Begonia tree in the Longevity Pavilion of Wanshou Mountain and hanged himself. The eunuch Wang Cheng'en saw that the emperor was already dead, immediately knelt before Emperor Sizong, and committed suicide by hanging himself.

Zhen'e and the princess exchanged clothes, telling the princess to hide in the mansion of the imperial father-in-law, while Zhen'e herself pretended to be the princess and hid in a dry well. The bandits hooked her out and presented her to Zicheng. Zicheng was very struck by her beauty and had every intention of taking her as his own, but fearing that the masses would not be convinced, he had to reluctantly give her to the general Li Yan, nicknamed One-Eyed Tiger, as his wife. Zhen'e requested to personally offer sacrifices to Emperor Sizong and the eunuch Wang Chengxi who had died with him before the wedding. Li Yan, having obtained a living beauty, agreed to everything.
