### Fierce Fighting Along the Wenzaobang Coast, Remnants of the Enemy are Being Cleared

The enemy's attempt to break through the Black Dahong House and Wall Gatehead failed. All enemies who crossed the river at West Six Room House have been annihilated. Enemy troops stirring in Zhabei and Jiangwan were all repelled by us.

Today's battle focus remains along the Wenzaobang coast. Remnants of the enemy army are gathered in the area from Black Dahong House to Wall Gatehead on the south bank. The enemy is attempting to break out to the east and west but has suffered severe blows. Our army launched a fierce counterattack starting at 5:00 PM, achieving considerable success. Fierce fighting continued late last night. To prevent our reinforcements from arriving, the enemy has been using combined air and artillery fire to bombard the Dachang-Zhenru Highway since noon, but our losses have been minimal. The enemy attempting to invade Guangfu's position has been repelled by our troops to the vicinity of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway. In the Zhabei area, the enemy launched another fierce attack yesterday, but after our counterattack, they retreated in a panic. The enemy's fourth general offensive has clearly failed again. Therefore, Matsui again claimed to reporters that he would launch a fifth general offensive. Supporting enemy troops arrived in Shanghai again yesterday. Their aggressive ambition has not yet been quelled, but we dare to assert that they will ultimately fail.

According to the Central News Agency, the Haitong News Agency reports that although the fighting along the line from Liuhe in the west to Jiangwan in the east is extremely fierce, the Japanese army has not been able to break through the Chinese army's line of defense. In fact, since October 5, the Chinese army's line of defense has not changed at all. In the main battle that began near Guangfu on the morning of the 9th, the Chinese army even drove the Japanese army out of its original position. The intensity of the fighting in the area west of Liuhang on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River is comparable only to the Battle of the Somme in the European War. The Japanese army only managed to seize the south bank of the river after using poison gas, but the fighting is still ongoing tonight, and neither side shows any signs of weakness. At this time, the Japanese army's focus on the attack on the Shanghai front seems to be greater than that on the North China front. Therefore, a large number of reinforcements have recently been sent to the left-wing front between Luodian and Jiangwan. It is expected that the Japanese army's move is not only hoping to break through the main resistance force of the Chinese army, but also to launch an attack on the Chinese army's position from the west.

### The Enemy Crossing the Wenzaobang River Was Struck Hard by Our Army and Will Soon Be Cleared

The Enemy's Attempt to Break Through at Black Dahong House Failed; Most of the Remaining Enemy at Wall Gatehead House Annihilated

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy who forcibly crossed the Wenzaobang River from Yanjiawan, Jiangjiazhai, and Chongqiao Station was bravely attacked by our army and forced to the riverbank. The enemy was still trying to resist stubbornly, but our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce attack on the enemy, making considerable progress. However, in order to prolong their survival, the enemy used poison gas to prevent our army from approaching. Our army knew that the enemy would resort to this tactic in the end, so we were prepared and continued to advance. As for the enemy who crossed the river at West Six Room House, they have all been annihilated by our army.

The Enemy's Attempt to Break Through at Black Dahong House Last Night Completely Failed After Fierce Fighting

At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the enemy army surrounded by us on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River engaged in fierce fighting with us near Black Dahong House. The enemy's purpose was to break out and rush towards Dachang, but our soldiers were as brave as tigers, and the position was as solid as a rock. The enemy could not cross the Lei Pool even one step and would soon be annihilated. When the reporter was drafting the manuscript at midnight, the good news arrived that our army had won a great victory. The clearing of the remaining enemy troops in that area is only a matter of time.

The Enemy Remaining at Wall Gatehead House Who Crossed the River Was Struck Hard by Us, and Most Have Been Annihilated

The Central News Agency's accompanying reporter reported at 10:10 AM on the 11th that the enemy who crossed the Wenzaobang River a few days ago and occupied the area around Wall Gatehead House has been surrounded and monitored by us, confined to a corner, and has repeatedly tried to break out. At first, they tried to flee east, but were intercepted by us and failed. This morning, they tried to advance west, but our army was prepared and gave them a head-on blow. The report stated that fierce fighting was still ongoing. As for the part of the enemy that crossed over from East Yangzhai, they have been annihilated by us over the past few days, and only a few remnants are stubbornly resisting near Gujiazhai. Our army is determined to punish them severely, so we continued to search and advance this morning and will soon be cleared out.

The Enemy at Wangjiazhai Stone Embankment Was Completely Cleared Out Yesterday Afternoon

At dawn yesterday morning, after the drizzle cleared, the enemy launched another large-scale invasion, using rafts to cross the river and break through our position on the north bank of the Wenzaobang River, occupying places such as Bafangzhai, Wangjiazhai, Stone Embankment, and Wall Gatehead. After our reinforcements arrived at the scene, they immediately took a siege formation. Seeing that there was no possibility of deploying a battle line, the enemy repeatedly tried to break out, but ultimately failed. Therefore, after being severely attacked by us, more than a hundred enemy soldiers were annihilated, and a few remaining troops were intercepted by us at the Stone Embankment riverbank. As of 2:00 PM, they had all been cleared out.

In the Tangqiao area, the fighting has been very intense for several days. The enemy has repeatedly sneaked into our army's position, but has been bravely repelled by our army. At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy built a bridge across the Xidijing River in West Tangqiao and attempted to cross it secretly, launching a fierce attack. Our army was already prepared and waited until they were close to our alert line, then we divided our forces and attacked the enemy from all sides. Fierce fighting was still ongoing as of the evening.

The Central News Agency, Suzhou, 11th dispatch: Due to continuous rain, the war situation in the front line, except for the fierce fighting in the Wenzaobang area, is relatively calm in other areas. Regarding the general situation of the battle on the Pudong front line in recent days, a military observer said that although the enemy in Pudong is constantly watching, their intention is not focused. Our army's defense in that area is tight, and the enemy will never succeed. There has been no fierce fighting in the areas of Luodian, Liuhang, and Guangfuzhen, and there have been no changes in the positions. However, while the enemy is calm on the left and right wings, they are focusing all their efforts on attacking our position in the Wenzaobang area, with the overall intention of attacking the rear of our Dachang position, so as to threaten our position in Jiangwan and Zhabei. This strategy has long been seen through by us. Our side has made arrangements and is waiting in a strong defensive position. Therefore, although the enemy launched a fierce attack, they fought a bloody battle in that area for several days and nights, and as a result, the enemy gained nothing. On the 10th, the enemy suddenly mobilized 20 to 30 warships and transport ships to places such as Liuhekou, Baimaikou, and Qiyakou, attempting to land in Liuhe Town. Our side has a strong military force in that area, and the enemy will definitely not achieve their goal. Moreover, the enemy's intention in this move is only to try to contain our military force.

### Fierce Fighting Erupted Again in Zhabei and Jiangwan Last Night

Our Army Holds the Advantage in Both Places; The Invading Enemy Suffered More Than a Hundred Casualties

The Central News Agency's accompanying reporter in Zhabei reported at 0:45 AM this morning that after the fighting in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas temporarily ceased yesterday morning, three enemy reconnaissance planes immediately took off to spy on various places. In the afternoon, five bombers dropped multiple bombs in places such as the Gonghe Road, Xibao Xing Road, and North Railway Station.

We Hold the Advantage on Both Routes of Invasion

At about 6:00 PM, fighting broke out again in various places. The enemy army, concentrated on North Sichuan Road, launched an invasion at about 7:00 PM on both Guangdong Street and East Baoxing Road, with about 300 people each. Our army defended each key point and responded calmly. For a time, the sounds of machine guns and small artillery fire were mixed together. Fierce fighting was still ongoing as of midnight. According to reports from the front, our army holds the advantage in both places. Although the enemy repeatedly charged, it was all in vain. In summary, the enemy army in both places has suffered more than 100 casualties.

The Enemy Army in Jiangwan Suffered Considerable Casualties

The enemy, about three companies from the Patriotic Girls' School and the 63rd Garden, also made moves at about 9:00 PM. First, seven enemy tanks drove along Jiangwan Road and bombarded our position with concentrated artillery fire. Then, their infantry advanced in a winding line and came into contact with our sentries on the Shuidaidian Road, resulting in a clash. After holding out until 10:30 PM, our army bravely launched an attack and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. Our army displayed great courage and killed many enemies. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy was already showing signs of retreating. At the same time, on the Baziqiao side, our army moved back and forth unpredictably and repeatedly launched surprise attacks. The enemy could not cope and suffered considerable casualties.

The Enemy's Attack on Yeyuan Was Completely Repelled

From the afternoon onwards, multiple enemy tanks were active in various places on Jiangwan Xiangyin Road, and were quite busy. At about 7:30 PM in the evening, about three companies of the enemy surged forward and pounced on our alert line at Yejia Garden. Our outpost made slight contact and retreated to a stronghold, firing machine guns and small artillery. The enemy army launched three attacks with small units one after another, but were all repelled by us, suffering more than 70 casualties. One of their tanks was also destroyed by us. As of the time of the report, both sides were still in a standoff.

We Took Advantage of the Victory and Charged North Sichuan Road

The Central News Agency's accompanying reporter reported at 12:00 PM on the 11th that at 3:30 AM this morning, a large enemy army again launched an invasion at the entrance of Guangdong Street. Our army took advantage of the strong wind and prepared to use fire to cut off their retreat. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy covered their flags and fled. On the East Baoxing Road side, after the enemy army attacked last night and was repelled by us, our army pressed on step by step, taking advantage of the victory to charge to North Sichuan Road and engaged the enemy in fierce fighting for three hours, killing more than 60 enemies and capturing two light machine guns and seventeen rifles. It was not until dawn that we reported victory and retreated to our original defense.

We Launched a Three-Pronged Attack on Baziqiao

The Central News Agency's accompanying reporter reported at 12:00 PM on the 11th that in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, the enemy army has been constantly invading for days. In order to take the initiative, we changed from defense to attack. At 3:00 AM this morning, we divided our forces into three routes from Baziqiao and advanced from Qujiazhao, Guangli Road, and Henghama Road, aiming at the Patriotic Girls' School and the 63rd Garden, launching a fierce attack with great momentum. The enemy army was extremely panicked and immediately mobilized multiple tanks, moving back and forth on Jiangwan Road, using concentrated artillery fire to prevent our army from advancing. Our side also used flat-trajectory guns to concentrate firepower and bombard the enemy continuously. The enemy vehicles retreated hastily, but one of them was destroyed by us, trapped in the mud and unable to move. On Guangli Road, our army continued to press on step by step, and the fierce fighting stopped after an hour and a half. The enemy suffered more than 30 dead and wounded, and we also suffered slight losses.

Our Army Charged Through the Rain and Repelled the Enemy

The Central News Agency's accompanying reporter reported at 10:10 AM on the 11th that last night the rain lessened slightly, and the enemy entrenched in the downtown area advanced through the rain, launching a fierce attack along the Yinxiang Road towards our lines at Fudan University and the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School. Our army bravely responded and fought fiercely all night. However, due to the disparity in numbers, we moved back slightly. Before dawn this morning, our army took advantage of the new rain clearing, wading through the mud and braving the rain of bullets, and launched a fierce counterattack on the enemy, charging several times and finally defeating the enemy, restoring our original position. The enemy retreated in panic, leaving behind many corpses, and we intercepted many rifles, bullets, and other military equipment.

### Matsui Claims He Will Launch Another General Offensive

A Fifth Reinforcement of More Than Two Thousand People Landed at the Qiujiang Wharf Yesterday Morning

The Zi Lin Bao reported that when Japanese Army Commander Matsui first met with Japanese newspaper reporters last Saturday, he said that the Japanese army would soon launch a general offensive to "break the resistance of the Chinese army," and described his declaration issued on Friday, saying that the Japanese army's preparations for the war were almost complete. Translator's note: The Japanese army has already launched four general offensives and five reinforcements. Now Matsui is saying that he will launch a general offensive to break the resistance of the Chinese army, which is tantamount to admitting that the four general offensives have yielded no results. The Zi Lin Bao added parentheses to the phrase "break the resistance of the Chinese army" to express doubt.

Since the enemy launched its fourth general offensive on the 28th of last month, it has remained confined to a corner of Eastern Shanghai, with no progress. The so-called pressure on our army to retreat to the Jiading-Nanxiang line by mid-October has become a fantasy. Now, in order to plan another counterattack, at about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, part of the enemy's fifth reinforcement army, about 2,000 people, continued to arrive, taking the giant transport ship Oregon Maru No. 186 to the Qiujiang Wharf, and immediately landed. After the enemy army landed, the ship sailed inward and docked at the Huishan Wharf.

### After Intermittent Rain, Enemy Planes Run Rampant

Squads Reconnoitered, and Bombs Fell in Open Spaces and Riverbanks; Yesterday's Heavy Bombing Focused on the Highway Between Dachang and Zhenru

Enemy planes bombed Zhabei twice again yesterday afternoon. The first time was around 12:30 PM, when there were four enemy planes, three in one team and one flying alone. They first circled in the sky several times, then dropped six or seven bombs, and then circled as before. At about 1:00 PM, they dropped four or five more bombs. After 4:00 PM, the second time, there were more than a dozen enemy planes, with each team having three or two planes. All the bombs were dropped along the section of the railway from the Hanqiao Bridge in the west to the Maigen Road Station, and they all fell on the open spaces and riverbanks on both sides of the railway tracks. The bombs dropped the first time fell on the open space south of the Commercial Press. In total, about thirty bombs were dropped in both attacks. Apart from destroying a few houses, there was no other damage. The enemy planes left at 5:45 PM.

Yesterday afternoon, at about 5:00 PM, a large number of enemy planes heavily bombed the highway between Dachang and Zhenru, flying at a high altitude. Most of the bombs dropped were ineffective, and our losses were minimal.

Yesterday afternoon, at about 2:00 PM, six enemy bombers flew from the east to the Nanshi area, circling twice before flying to Tangqiao in Pudong and bombing, dropping five bombs. Black smoke spread everywhere where the bombs landed. It is estimated that two bombs landed in the fields, and the other three bombs destroyed six or seven houses. Three residents were injured, including a child named Fan Abao, who was the most seriously injured. Two bombs also landed behind the Yitaixing Coal Yard in Bailianjing, but it is said that there was no damage. From 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, several enemy planes flew to Tangqiao, Laobaidu, Yangjiadu, Zhangjialou, Qinci Yangdian, and Qichangzhan in Pudong, dropping as many as forty or fifty bombs. This kind of aimless atrocity only caused slight casualties to innocent civilians and did no damage to our military.

According to the Central News Agency, in recent days, there has been continuous autumn rain and thick fog, so enemy planes have been less active. Apart from occasionally flying to the outskirts of the city to reconnoiter when the rain stops slightly, no large groups of enemy planes have appeared. Yesterday morning the rain stopped, and around noon the air pressure gradually increased and the sky showed signs of clearing. As a result, more than thirty enemy planes took off from the enemy's temporary airfield at the end of Yangshupu Road. After circling several times, nine of them flew to the Nanshi area of Pudong to reconnoiter. At about 1:00 PM in the afternoon, they dropped four bombs behind the Pudong Electric Company in Zhangjiabang. The bombs landed in the nearby open space, and we suffered no losses. Another group of more than twenty planes flew to Zhabei, Zhenru, and Dachang to reconnoiter. Then, this group of enemy planes was divided into two groups. One group of about six or seven planes lingered over the Zhabei area where our position was located, and the other group of about ten planes patrolled the highway of Zhenru Dachang, in addition to dropping many bombs, they often flew low and strafed with machine guns, destroying many of our civilian houses and killing many residents. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, another nine enemy planes, divided into three teams, reconnoitered back and forth in the Nanshi area of Pudong, and dropped many bombs near the Riqing Company in Nanshi Waima Road, Pudong Lujiadu, and Yangjiadu. At the same time, the enemy ships in Pudong also fired cannons at our Pudong position at intervals. For a time, the rumbling sound was endless, but only a few of our civilian houses were destroyed. As for the cannons fired by the enemy ships, the bombs mostly fell in open spaces due to inaccurate targets, so our losses were minimal. This group of enemy planes flew away at about 6:00 PM.

### More Than 20 Enemy艇 Protecting Izumo

The Number of Enemy Warships Docked in Shanghai Increased to 24 Yesterday

According to the Central News Agency, in addition to covering the south, north, and west sides of the enemy's flagship Izumo, anchored at buoy No. 2, with electric nets, leaving only a part of the east side to allow for free movement, more than 20 small motorboats, each equipped with two machine guns, are anchored near the ship to serve as escorts. In addition, two yellow merchant ships are docked on the Pudong side of Lujiazui, equipped with multiple machine guns and cannons of various sizes. In addition to escorting the Izumo, they also occasionally fire cannons at our Pudong position.

The number of enemy warships docked in Shanghai yesterday, including seven transport ships, has increased to a total of 24. The distribution is as follows: (1) One cruiser, the Izumo, remains anchored at buoy No. 2. (2) Seven destroyers are anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf, two ships, and one ship each at buoys No. 1, No. 3, No. 4, No. 7, and No. 37. (3) Nine transport ships are divided into two ships each at the Osaka, Huishan, and China Merchants Bureau North Wharfs, and one ship at buoy No. 5, the Diyang Maru (the Tsurumi Maru, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning carrying coal and docked at the China Merchants Bureau Central Wharf, sailed out at around 4:00 PM yesterday). (4) Nine gunboats are divided into two ships each at buoys No. 5 and No. 11, and one ship each at buoys No. 9, No. 13, No. 17, No. 20, and No. 30. The above totals twenty-four ships.

### The Enemy Transported Dead Officers and Soldiers Away From Shanghai

The enemy transport ships Guangde Maru, Diyang Maru, and Nagasaki Maru, which arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, after Guangde Maru transported a large number of enemy corpses away from Shanghai back to Japan on the same afternoon, the remaining two ships were also loading wounded and dead enemy soldiers yesterday and left Shanghai immediately. It is also learned that this batch of enemy corpses was transported to Korea and Taiwan to be cremated, and then the ashes were packed in cans and transported to Yokohama for distribution to the families of each enemy soldier.

The Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th dispatch: According to the Tokyo Radio broadcast, the remains of Major General Kurokawa, who died in the Shanghai war, were transported to Tokyo on the 9th.

### Yue Wang Temple in Taicang Bombed

Many Innocent Civilians Were Killed and Injured; Primary School Students Also Suffered the Calamity

According to the Central News Agency, a person from Taicang said that Yue Wang City in the county is located on the left bank of Yanglin Pond, about ten miles from the river. The market is usually prosperous. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, because the area is far from the war zone, many residents of the war zone have fled to the area, and the population has increased sharply, making the market lively. However, on the morning of the 7th of this month, enemy planes suddenly went to commit atrocities in groups, dropping more than ten bombs in a row. After investigation, seventy or eighty houses were destroyed, and Yue Wang City Primary School was also bombed. Because it was during class, dozens of primary school students were killed and injured. Several bombs also hit the center of the downtown area, so the damage from the bombing was very serious. The Taicang and Jiading fellows association has taken measures to provide relief. This kind of bestial behavior by enemy planes is just to strengthen our determination to fight against the enemy with one heart and one mind.

### Enemy's Far-Fetched Explanation to Foreign Reporters

Chemical Shells; Contradictory Words Before and After

The Continental Daily reported that when the spokesman for the Japanese army met with foreign reporters on Sunday afternoon, he also mentioned that the Japanese army had used chemical shells in the fighting in the Luodian area. A foreign reporter said that he had witnessed Chinese wounded soldiers transported from the Luodian front who had suffered severe burns, and some people seemed to be poisoned and were breathing very rapidly. The spokesman still defended as before, saying that the Japanese army had never used any chemicals in this war. The reporter asked him to explain this clearly. The spokesman made a far-fetched defense, saying that sometimes the power of high-explosive shells and bombs is the same as that of chemicals. People near the explosion may suffer burns all over their bodies, and some people may have rapid breathing because they contain carbon compounds.

### Yangtze River Freight Resumes Today

Jiangyin Allows Barges to Pass; Goods Between Shanghai and Hankou Can Be Transported

The Yangtze River waterway has been blockaded by our army at Jiangyin for 63 days now. The Yangtze River ships of various Chinese and foreign companies have resumed services from Zhenjiang and Nanjing to Hankou last month. However, goods from Shanghai still cannot be connected and transported to various places upstream. Although some goods have been transferred to Zhenjiang from inland rivers, they can only pass with a passport, and the procedures are complicated, so it has not been realized. In recent days, various shipping companies such as Taikoo, Jardine, Sanbei, and Ning Shao have repeatedly held meetings and clarified to our authorities that the transport of commercial goods to and from the Yangtze River should be facilitated during this long-term resistance in order to maintain the market. After discussion, it was approved to use small barges to carry goods upstream and downstream from Shanghai to Hankou (including Wuhu and Jiujiang along the Yangtze River, and Yichang, Shashi, Changsha, Chongqing, and other places upstream). Starting today (12th), shallow-water small cargo barges are allowed to pass through the Xiaojiang Channel waterway in Jiangyin to Zhenjiang, where they will connect to the Yangtze River ships of various companies to transport them to various ports upstream. As for downstream goods, they are transferred from Zhenjiang through the specially permitted channel in Jiangyin and transported to Shanghai. It was decided by various companies yesterday to leave small barges between Zhenjiang and Jiangyin for the purpose of transporting lotus flowers. However, due to the transfer complications, the freight rate will be increased, and the water freight price for each ton of goods will be 42 yuan, which is about five times higher than usual. If each Yangtze River ship has 1,500 tons of cargo loaded upstream and downstream, it will have an income of 126,000 yuan, and it must be paid in cash and no longer recorded in the account. Therefore, starting today, freight transport from Shanghai to the Yangtze River can be directly connected. There are many goods accumulated in the past two months. Now that it is heard that various companies can directly transport them, all customers are rushing to report their orders.

### Autumn Cocoons Stopped in Zhejiang Province

The Unified Commission Collects and Reels Itself; The Price of Cocoons is 25 Yuan Per Load

The Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee has negotiated a loan of 8.5 million yuan for autumn cocoons with the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture, to be lent to manufacturers to purchase autumn cocoons, and at the same time to encourage manufacturers to purchase. Due to the reduction of manufacturers applying for registration to purchase cocoons due to the impact of the war, the Autumn Cocoon Management Committee was organized in the twenty-sixth year to purchase itself. Now, the cocoon banks in Jiaxing, Haining, Pinghu, and other places have stopped weighing one after another. Although the central price of fresh cocoons is 40 yuan, 70% in cash and 30% on account, the actual cash price collected by each factory is about 25 yuan. The reeling is about 420 catties. The cocoons collected by the Sericulture Control Committee will be entrusted to various silk factories in Zhejiang Province for reeling, and the raw silk will be sold abroad by the Raw Silk Sales Committee. The 30% of the account payment must be repaid to the farmers after the cocoons collected have been reeled into silk and sold, if there is a surplus.

### Overview of the Organization of the Wartime Service Corps of Students

Du Liang, the deputy director of the group organization department, personally sent the items to the front to express condolences, and female members of the group accompanied him to work as nurses in the field hospitals. Recently, there has been a team of members preparing to serve in the North China war zone, and they are waiting for orders to depart. As for the telecommunications team, they will soon be transferred to a certain place for training, and after the training period expires, they will be assigned to serve in the war zone. All members of the General Brigade are now actively working hard to raise funds. Their fundraising goals are national salvation bonds and winter clothing. The work of other school corps has also been determined in the work program of the school corps, and is being actively promoted.

### British Fleet Commander Inspects Shantou and Xiamen Waters

Enemy Warships Rampant in Hong Kong, British Territories Threatened

Admiral Little, Commander of the British Far East Fleet, sailed south on his flagship the week before last for an inspection tour. He is about to depart from Shantou for Hong Kong. It is expected that Mr. Li will return to Shanghai around the 25th of this month. It is understood that enemy warships are rampant near Hong Kong, forcibly occupying the Dongsha and Xisha Islands, and sinking fishing boats. British territories such as Hong Kong and Singapore are all under threat. Most of the ships belonging to the British Far East Fleet have now been transferred there. During this trip, Mr. Li will listen to reports from the captains of each ship and provide instructions on protective measures.

### Fresh Pork Industry Organizes Wartime Joint Venture

Temporary Market Established, Application Approved

Since the start of the Shanghai Battle on August 13th, the business of the Fresh Pork Industry Association members has been at a standstill. Subsequently, the Chamber of Commerce ordered the industry to strive to maintain business, in order to safeguard the city's meat supply and secure the livelihoods of workers. The association then persuaded various pork businesses to organize a wartime joint venture, sending personnel to ports in Jiangbei such as Tong, Ru, Jing, and Tai counties to clear the source of fresh pork. A plot of open space on Labor Father Road was designated as a temporary market. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of wartime transportation, transportation was changed to inland ports in counties such as Su, Xi, Kun, and Qing, disembarking at Xujiahui, Beixinjing, and other locations, and then loaded onto trucks to Shanghai for sale. It is heard that the Fresh Pork Industry Joint Venture has now been submitted to the Municipal Social Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for approval and record.

### Despicable Behavior: Enemy Aircraft Impersonates Our National Emblem

Reconnaissance Flight Near Kunshan

[Nanjing] At 8:43 AM on the 3rd of this month, an enemy reconnaissance plane, brazenly impersonating our military aircraft markings, flew low and circled near Kunshan for reconnaissance. It was only after our patrol team fired at it that it flew east. Fortunately, there was no major damage. This kind of dishonorable behavior by the enemy air force is truly damaging to the integrity of military personnel. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)

### Yesterday, Our Artillery on the Pudong Front Displayed Divine Skill Again

Hit Two Enemy Warships, Destroyed Multiple Military Trucks, Naval Wharf and Wansui Hall Destroyed

Our Pudong artillery unit once again displayed great skill yesterday, launching a fierce bombardment against the enemy's bases in Yangshupu and Hongkou. From morning till night, the continuous barrage did not cease. In the evening, the artillery fire was quite intense, destroying many enemy positions. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River also fired back at us. The artillery battles became particularly intense late into the night, around 11 PM, with about three or four shells per minute. The rumbling sounds shook all of Shanghai. Our positions suffered little damage. At 0:40 AM today, the artillery battle started again. The flashes of fire and loud explosions greatly threatened the enemy. The Central News Agency reported that on National Day, in addition to holding solemn and enthusiastic commemorative ceremonies in various sectors of the city, our artillery positions in Pudong continued the spirit of the martyrs, unleashing great power, firing fiercely at enemy warships in the Huangpu River and enemy positions in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas, starting at 8 PM that evening. The sound of artillery rumbled, shaking the vicinity. Two enemy warships were hit, but unfortunately, the shells did not penetrate their decks. Therefore, the wounded enemy warships were still able to flee downstream in panic. In addition, after investigation, it has been confirmed that the enemy Gongda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu was hit by several shells, destroying thirteen or fourteen enemy military trucks. The enemy naval wharf and Wansui Hall on Minhang Road were also destroyed. Suffering these losses, the enemy hurriedly launched a combined counterattack from the enemy warships in the Huangpu River. Our Pudong ×××××× warehouses were hit by enemy shells and burned fiercely yesterday afternoon.

Furthermore, according to news from the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, when our Pudong artillery hit the Wansui Hall, the Japanese director of the company was secretly conferring with high-ranking enemy officers in the hall. Unexpectedly, the shell flew in, hitting him directly, killing him on the spot. His body was incomplete and unrecognizable.

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 11th: Our artillery has been frequently bombarding enemy positions in recent days, demonstrating divine power. Many enemy positions have been destroyed by us.

### Wartime Specialized Education

— Chen Wangdao

The term "wartime education" is usually a broad term that encompasses all kinds of education, from social to school, from general to specialized. Because we are now at war, in order to meet the needs of the war, it must of course share the general characteristics of wartime, and jointly impart the necessary knowledge and skills for wartime, but each still has its own special characteristics - for example, social education and general education must be carried out locally, while specialized education can move the venue and start school, which is a different point - it is difficult to generalize.

In this war of resistance, many of our specialized educational institutions have been destroyed by enemy artillery fire, such as Fudan, Shanghai, Tongji, and Chizhi. Many, such as Datong and Daxia, which are located in the war zone and cannot be used normally, have to move the venue and start school. The only difference is whether they move near or far. The problem of moving far and near is best not to be conceived solely from the convenience of the school, but rather to be coordinated with the needs of military, political, and economic affairs. For example, liberal arts and law, which were originally in Shanghai, such a front line, I think it is still possible to stay in the front line, and there is no need to move far away; staying in the front line can at least enable students to gain some teaching and learning experience in social education, and there is only benefit and no harm, except for being relatively dangerous; for example, agricultural sciences can be moved to places where resettled refugees are cultivating, and engineering can be moved to newly built industrial areas, which can also enable each other to increase their knowledge and prevent knowledge and action from being separated. Other subjects can also be distributed in this way. Now that many specialized educational institutions have jointly moved and started school, I think that such decentralization is not inconvenient for the presiding staff, and it may be decided by agreement that the staff of School A will handle Subject A, and the staff of School B will handle Subject B, similar to the organization of an independent college in peacetime, and a general agency will be organized by the highest presiding staff of each school to manage the overall situation. School buildings are also unlikely to be a problem. What education needs most is books and instruments, not tall buildings. Having tall buildings but not enough books and instruments may make people feel that they are building houses, not running education. Having books and instruments but no tall buildings can not only be a symbol of wartime, but if it can enlighten students to live in peace, frugality, and happiness, even the school buildings can be regarded as a kind of wartime course. Decorating too much on the facade, like a department store, is not an advantage that we must stubbornly adhere to in education. We might as well take advantage of the general situation where universities move to middle schools, middle schools move to elementary schools, and school buildings are downgraded to follow each other. We should not regard that downgrading and following as purely accommodating and purely avoiding disasters, but should think far ahead and regard it as the starting point of a kind of innovation in educational equipment.

Departments should not be cut, courses must be reformed:

(1) In addition to the usual compulsory common courses, some compulsory common wartime courses can be added. If the school's economics department can add wartime economics, the chemistry department can add war chemistry, the literature department can add wartime literature, the political science department can add international relations, etc., these courses can be proposed as compulsory courses for all students to study together. If you feel that it takes too much time and cannot be arranged, you can reduce one or two of the compulsory common subjects in peacetime, and temporarily stop teaching the more cumbersome subjects in the courses of each department (such as the "Research on the Book of Changes" of the Literature Department of a certain university for three hours a week, and the "Research on Zhuangzi" for three hours a week), so as to free up time to insert these subjects.

(2) The basic courses of each subject must still be studied as usual, but they can be tightened as much as possible, or the parts of the curriculum related to the current situation can be developed more.

(3) Intensify military training and political training in addition to regular classes, so that every student can pick up a gun to resist the enemy, and every student can take on political work. The time for commemorative weeks or lectures can also be used as time for political training. In addition, various societies can also be organized, such as current affairs research societies, to increase awareness of the war of resistance.

In short, wartime specialized education must be coordinated with the military, but we should not forget that it is a major plan to cultivate people, and the revision of courses must be able to take into account the overall situation, so as not to cause malpractice.

In fact, a country like China should have made a plan to take into account the overall situation in advance in peacetime when the war comes. Now that a full-scale war has broken out, a special meeting should be held immediately to discuss it in detail. Let the meeting decide on many complex and related issues.

### Fierce Fighting on the Pinghan Railway, Our Army Firmly Defends Shijiazhuang

A Small Number of Enemy Soldiers Sneakily Cross the Hutuo River, Enemy Attack on Yuanping Repelled, Armies Still Facing Each Other Across the River on the Jinpu Line

[Nanjing] The Japanese telegram falsely claimed that they occupied Shijiazhuang at 2:30 PM on the 10th. According to our authorities, this is absolutely false, because at 6 PM on the 11th, the authorities were on the phone with Shijiazhuang. Therefore, the Japanese telegram is completely unfounded. (Special dispatch on the 11th)

[Beiping] Although Japanese semi-official sources claim that the Japanese army occupied Shijiazhuang yesterday afternoon, Shijiazhuang was obviously still in the hands of the Chinese army last night. This morning, the Japanese military communique only stated that a small team of Japanese soldiers had entered the northern suburbs of Shijiazhuang, and that the Japanese army, which had crossed the Hutuo River to the east, was advancing in order to encircle Shijiazhuang and cut off the retreat of the Chinese army. However, the water is knee-deep, and the Japanese army is having difficulty advancing. The Chinese army at other locations along the Hutuo River is now defending its position. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 11th)

[Beiping] The Japanese army's right wing operating in North China crossed the Hutuo River today under artillery cover and advanced towards Ping Shan County, and the air force bombed the county town at will.

[Nanjing] News from the transportation sector: The water level of various rivers in Hebei Province has risen sharply recently, and the situation in Tianjin is very dangerous.

### Foreign Goods are Increasing in Price, Chinese People Should Use Domestically Produced Goods

Since the Shanghai war, national financial resources have been concentrated. In the future, every penny spent on foreign goods will reduce the national treasury by one penny. Therefore, foreign goods will soon disappear. Recently, due to the lack of foreign goods, prices have soared. Those who want to buy tonics for autumn and winter are best to use fresh local chicken juice, which costs only 12 yuan per month. Beef juice costs 4 yuan per month. The effect is better than foreign goods. Call 95259 for immediate delivery.

### The Nine-Power Treaty Conference Will Be Held in Brussels

We Decided to Send Gu, Guo, and Qian as Representatives to Attend, The Tokyo Government Has Not Yet Indicated Its Attitude

[London] According to official sources, the conference of signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty will be held in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, in about two weeks. It is now only waiting for the consent of the Belgian government before it can be decided. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)

[Geneva] The advisory committee on the Sino-Japanese issue of the League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to hold a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on the 10th of next month. Therefore, it is believed that the conference of signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty will also be held there. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 10th)

[Nanjing] News from diplomatic circles: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is being consulted by the British, American, and French authorities as a preparation before the conference. The date and location of the meeting will be decided in the coming days. After our government receives the invitation, the candidates for representatives will be Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, and Qian Tai, with Gu as the chief representative. As for the Japanese side, knowing that they are in the wrong, they will inevitably refuse to participate. It is generally expected that at this conference, in order to maintain collective peace, even if Japan does not attend, it will be sanctioned by default and effective measures will be decided to stop the aggression. Our country will also urge the conference to pay attention to this point. As for the American President, he will suggest a mediation method for Japan. According to our diplomats, our country's position on the war of resistance has been repeatedly stated by Chairman Jiang: "We will not stop fighting until Japan withdraws its troops." Within this limit, our side can accept mediation to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue in a peaceful manner. Gu Weijun left Geneva on the evening of the 7th and returned to Paris for a rest, and is still scheduled to go to Geneva within the week in order to consult with the representatives of various countries stationed at the League of Nations at any time. (Special dispatch on the 11th)

(Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe told the Associated Press today that he had carefully read President Roosevelt's speech and the US State Department's statement. Japan has not yet decided on its policy on whether to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The invitation has not yet been received. However, Japan's fixed policy is still that the issues that caused the conflict only concern China and Japan, and therefore can only be resolved between China and Japan.

### The Shanghai Truce Agreement Does Not Have Any Clauses Restricting Chinese Military Action

Guo Taiqi's Letter to The Times of London

[London] Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, wrote to The Times of London on the 11th, stating that since the Hongqiao Incident, Japanese troops have landed in Shanghai. If the Chinese government had not ordered the mobilization of troops to engage in defense within its own territory at that time, the government would not have been able to fulfill its main responsibility. Guo continued to recount the declaration he made on behalf of the Chinese government when signing the Shanghai Truce Agreement, saying that there were no provisions in the agreement that imposed any permanent restrictions on the mobilization of Chinese troops. This point was recognized by the representatives of the mediating powers, and the Japanese representatives did not raise any objections. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)

### Japanese Sophistry

British Newspaper Article Refutes

[London] Following the League of Nations and the US government's condemnation of Japan's actions in China, Japan issued a rebuttal. Today, The Times published an article refuting this rebuttal, stating that the Nanjing government had been relentlessly fighting against communism for over a decade, ultimately succeeding. It is astonishing that Japan now accuses the Nanjing government of succumbing to communist conspiracies. Regarding Japan's claim that Japanese troops in North China were attacked by North Chinese soldiers, this is undoubtedly a result of Japan's policy of undermining the sovereignty and power of the Nanjing government in the northern provinces. As for the cause of the Shanghai conflict, even if China exercised its rights under the 1932 agreement by deploying troops into the demilitarized zone in Shanghai, giving Japan a pretext for engaging in a costly and ultimately unsuccessful war, Japan's claim that China is responsible for the current hostilities, that Japan is purely acting in self-defense, and that it has not violated any treaties, is hardly convincing to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. The reasons Japan has given are too weak to be generally accepted. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 11th)

He made the following remarks: "The Japanese have been plotting to invade our country for a long time. This time, they are launching a full-scale invasion, which is a critical moment for the survival of the Chinese nation. We must unite as one, be sincere and united, and implement a scorched-earth resistance policy to overcome this dangerous situation. Now that full-scale resistance has begun, all Chinese people should be determined to sacrifice, obey the orders of the supreme leader, and fight to the end. Then, final victory will surely belong to us. This war of resistance is a great opportunity for the revival of our nation. In the history of our country, there has never been such a great war against foreign aggression. I am very optimistic about the future of the war of resistance. The people of Guangxi have been preparing for total mobilization since the outbreak of the war of resistance. If necessary, they can deploy 3 to 4 million troops.

### Central Party Headquarters Commemorates the Premier's Martyrdom in London Yesterday

Zou Lu Leads Ceremony and Delivers Report - Memorial Services Also Held in Various Regions

[Nanjing] After holding the Premier's Memorial Week on the morning of the 11th, the Central Party Headquarters held a meeting to commemorate the Premier's martyrdom in London. Committee Member Zou Lu led the ceremony and delivered a speech, the original text of which is as follows: "At this critical moment of national crisis, we are holding this memorial service for the Premier's martyrdom in London during this Memorial Week, commemorating the day of the Premier's martyrdom during this period of national suffering. This cannot but make us feel even more excited and sorrowful. Now, the enemy, disregarding international morality, tearing up the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact that they voluntarily signed, is invading our country with all their naval, land, and air forces, and massacring our people. This not only poisons the invaded, but also threatens the peace of all countries in the world and makes them feel uneasy. However, we believe that justice, although sometimes held hostage by violence, cannot be destroyed by violence. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, except for the enemy, the public opinion of all countries has sympathized with us and condemned the brutality of the aggressors. The attitude of various governments has also gradually and clearly shown the division between right and wrong. Now the League of Nations has passed a resolution condemning Japan, and major powers such as Britain, the United States, France, and Russia have also made clear expressions. It can be seen that justice will ultimately prevail over violence. This is a powerful proof. Recalling the Premier's martyrdom in London, thanks to the help of Mr. Kang Deli and others, he was able to escape danger, which was also the result of the Premier's great personality. Now, at this critical moment for the country, the whole nation is struggling to save China and to uphold the dignity of international morality, to defend treaties, and to maintain world peace. Therefore, we can gain the sympathy of the people and countries all over the world. This cannot be exchanged for by false propaganda. We also recall that the Premier constantly instructed us at his deathbed to strive for peace and save China. Now we are striving for peace to save China. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has also said that our determination to defend ourselves is consistent, and even to the last soldier and the last inch of territory, we will not change our original intention. Our resistance will not stop until justice is established and the treaties regain their dignity. We can only follow the established national policy and fight to the end. The enemy's brutal nature has finally been exposed by themselves. Recently, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's spokesman's remarks blatantly stated that the world was created for mankind, and that all honest and diligent nationals have the right to live happily and enjoy life anywhere. If resource-rich countries refuse resource-poor countries and make concessions to vested interests, there is no other way to solve the problem except war. This is a clear indication that Japan wants to invade any country and seize any country's resources. This is the most powerful confession that caused this war. Is Japan an honest and diligent country? We believe that facts speak louder than words. We don't need to list the facts. Everyone in the world understands that Japan is the most untrustworthy and cunning country. But we also understand that the enemy's brutality is caused by a few ambitious warlords. Among the Japanese people, there are also many enlightened people who are oppressed by their warlords' brutality and dare not speak out. I sincerely hope that the Japanese people will rise up and respond to world opinion, fight for justice, and restrain the brutality of their warlords. I deeply hope that the Japanese people will rise up and respond to world opinion, fight for justice, and restrain the brutality of their warlords. Because I commemorate the Premier's martyrdom, I recall the Premier's efforts and struggles, which resulted in the help of many friendly countries. The Premier finally succeeded. I firmly believe that today the nation and the nation are in distress, led by the supreme military leader, and will eventually gain international sympathy, and I firmly believe that final victory will belong to us."

### Shen Tongwu Appointed as Puppet Tianjin Mayor

The Education Association and other organizations have petitioned the authorities to confiscate all of Shen's property in Changshu, remove him as the principal of the Kaizhi School, seal up his house. Shen graduated from the Japanese Military Academy, where he was a classmate of Sun Chuanfang. In the early years of the Republic of China, he served in the military and received the rank of major general. When Sun was entrenched in the southeast, Shen once served as the Jiangsu Qingxiang Superintendent. After Sun's defeat, Shen lived in Tianjin. When Huang Yingbai was the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, Shen was appointed as the Director of the Tianjin Municipal Telecommunications Administration. Now that he has taken this puppet position, he is afraid of being scolded by the Chinese people, so he changed his name to Shen Tongxian. (One said Shen Xianwu). His late years are not fragrant, which is really hateful.

### Coming and Going in Bombing

— Guo Moruo

(2)

After visiting the two Zhang and Li Gentlemen and returning to my residence, a person sent by Cixiu came to report to me that the car had arrived and was being oiled. The departure time was 6:00 PM. It was drizzling. When we reached a place where two large trucks were stopped, our car also stopped. The driver of the front car came to tell us that enemy planes were attacking. When we listened carefully, we did hear a flapping sound in the hazy sky, but we didn't know whether it was our planes or enemy planes.

The flapping sound disappeared, and the car started again.

We drove through the entire night, and it wasn't until 5:00 AM on the 22nd that we arrived in Nanjing. It is said that the road we took at night bypassed ××.

After arriving in Nanjing, the first thing I did was to visit Director Zhao Chunru of the ×× Army's resident office in Nanjing. Guided by Chunru, I then visited ×× and friends in the military establishment. I found the conversation to be the most interesting thing, because their attitude was very straightforward, and their will to resist was very firm.

The words were spoken at ××'s place. My assessment is that the Soviet Union's entry into the war may be triggered by Japan taking the lead in initiating the situation. The reason is that what Japan fears most is the Soviet Eastern Army's air raids. The Soviet Union can launch air power from Vladivostok to destroy Japan's heartland, such as Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe, and the aircraft's range can allow them to come and return repeatedly. Japan's air force can certainly destroy Vladivostok or even further destroy the heavy industrial zones on the southern shore of Lake Baikal, but these areas are not related to the Soviet Union's survival. If Japan's air force wants to bomb Moscow or Leningrad, that is like a dream. In our war of resistance against Japan, the Japanese are seeking a quick victory, but our will to resist is becoming increasingly firm, and a quick victory is already impossible. This has made the Japanese anxious. The longer the war of resistance lasts, the more intense the Japanese's anxiety becomes, and therefore their fear of the Soviet Union will also increase. In order to relieve their own fear, I think the Japanese may take the initiative to attack the Soviet Union.

Zhirou didn't quite agree with my point of view. He said that the Japanese should first deal with us with all their strength, while appeasing the Soviet Union so as not to let it get involved in the whirlpool. It would be foolish to deal with two countries at once. Furthermore, they cannot attack the Soviet Union's war preparations.

Zhirou's view is usually the right one. From a rational standpoint, it is natural to first deal with us with all their strength. However, the Japanese military has long lost its rationality. If they were still acting rationally, first of all they should realize that the invasion of China only increases their crisis of national destruction; secondly, at the very least, they should realize that since they are fighting in North China, they should not come to the south to provoke conflicts again. However, they are completely unaware of these two points, and we can speculate that they themselves would consider it wise to attack the Soviet Union. As the art of war says, "act before others to control them."

However, these are all estimates. What the facts are, only time will tell.

### British Labor Party MP Calls on Britain and America to Cooperate in Curbing Japan

Advocates for Economic Sanctions - Voices of Justice Resonate East and West

[London] The Chairman of the London City Council and Labor Party MP, Morrison, delivered a radio address to the United States tonight, advocating for "appropriate actions to stop the murderous acts of the irresponsible in the world" and criticizing the failure of democratic governments to exert leadership. He praised President Roosevelt's recent speech, believing that Roosevelt had pointed out the method of stopping war, and said that Roosevelt's speech had resonated in Britain. "The spontaneous indignation of American public opinion, as caused by this Sino-Japanese war, is unprecedented. The epidemic of lawless war can only be prevented by isolation, and isolation means boycotting Japanese goods. Mere advocacy is not enough to stop Japan's aggression. Governments must take more thorough action, especially by exerting economic pressure. In practice, countries only need to ban the shipment of oil to Japan to have a decisive effect. Japan buys 3 million tons of oil each year. After the oil embargo is implemented, these 3 million tons can be purchased and stored by other governments or used to help China purchase them to meet urgent needs. It is hoped that governments will quickly reach an agreement to prohibit their people from shipping oil to Japan separately. If this is implemented, I believe that British public opinion will firmly support it. The principles put forward by President Roosevelt with great courage have already been endorsed by British Prime Minister Chamberlain at the Conservative Party Congress. It is hoped that the British government can go a step further and put forward appropriate suggestions so that those who sit and talk can act. In a nutshell, there are only two paths to follow: one is to let the world be plunged into the vortex of war, and the other is to use peaceful international economic forces to curb military aggression. Britain and the United States must choose," he said. (Central News Agency, Havas, 11th)

[Washington] The Foreign Policy Association held a meeting here today to discuss possible ways for the League of Nations and the United States to cooperate against Japan. The result was that the association felt that the League of Nations could declare an arms and shipping embargo against Japan, while the United States could invoke the Neutrality Act to ban arms exports and prohibit all American ships from transporting military supplies to China and Japan. The association felt that this kind of cooperation could compensate for the losses caused by the arms embargo imposed on China. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 10th)

⊙ Atlantic City - The US Industrial Organization Committee held its annual meeting today and passed a resolution that all future actions against Japan will be at the behest of President Roosevelt's proposals.

### American Newspaper Comments on Sino-Japanese Situation

Ishii's Previous Words Still Ringing in Ears - Why This Trip?

[New York] The Sino-Japanese War and possible American intervention remain the subject of commentary in American newspapers across the country today. Many newspapers are adorned with satirical cartoons. The New York Post calls on President Roosevelt to avoid appointing Davis as the special envoy to the Nine-Power Treaty conference, believing that Davis is too close to the banking community and does not have the trust of Congress and the people. Famous journalist and commentator Virate wrote to the New York Forum of Public Opinion that Japan has now sent Viscount Ishii to the United States to lobby. He recalls that when he hosted Ishii at a banquet in 1917, Ishii vowed that Japan would never invade Chinese territory. If Ishii now wants to lobby in the United States, his first task is to compare the current situation in China with his previous words to see if they are in line. Ishii may find it difficult to justify himself and it is unnecessary to make this trip. (National Telegraph, 11th)

### Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Celebrate Double Tenth National Day

Former German Ambassador to China Sympathizes with Our Country's Resistance - London Raises Large Sums to Help Wounded Soldiers and Refugees

[London] Today is the Chinese National Day, and London also has a grand celebration, initiated by the Chinese Wounded Soldiers and Civilian Relief Committee, holding a meeting at Trafalgar Square, playing the Chinese National Anthem, with a large Chinese chorus in the square singing together, and raising donations on the spot, with attendees enthusiastically donating large sums. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 10th)

⊙ Frankfurt - The Chinese Academy here held a celebration of the Chinese National Day yesterday at the Carlton Hotel, attended by leaders in science, literature, German party, government, and military dignitaries, representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Germany, overseas Chinese, and Chinese students in Germany. Professor Russell, president of the Chinese Academy, gave a speech on "The Chinese View of Destiny." Russell mentioned the current difficulties in China, pointing out the vitality of the Chinese nation, which has been demonstrated at any time for four thousand years, even though it has gone through centuries of turmoil, it is not enough to cause harm. If the Chinese lose faith in the legendary idea that they are not in danger, it will be a real difficulty. Russell explained that the Chinese view of "fate" can be divided into three aspects: (1) "I have destiny," (2) "I have my destiny," (3) "I am destiny." From the words of many Chinese thinkers and philosophers, the Chinese view of destiny that "man can conquer nature" can be found. This view is a characteristic of the Chinese national tradition and can also be a secret to China's handling of the current conflict in the Far East. After the celebration ceremony, a dinner was held, and the first president of the Chinese Academy, former German ambassador to China, Bo Xi, gave a speech, reporting on the overview of the Republic of China in the past 26 years, saying that although there have been many disturbances, there has been amazing progress in economics, technology, and culture, especially in the past two years, the financial situation has made China one of the few countries in the world with stable currencies. Bo Xi then expressed deep sympathy for China's painful but unavoidable resistance to the war, saying that this conflict has united all factions in China, and its consolidation, sincerity, and shared hatred of the enemy are unprecedented in history, which is truly commendable. Then, Mr. Liu, a Chinese lecturer in Frankfurt, thanked the meeting on behalf of Chinese Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang and reported on the domestic situation. Mr. Liu solemnly denied that China and Soviet Russia had a very close relationship and strongly refuted the fallacy that Japan used China as an outlet for its excessive population. The attendees then sang the national anthems of China and Germany before dispersing. (Reuters, 11th)

⊙ Hollywood - According to Hollywood Evening Post film columnist Fischer, in a broadcast on a certain broadcasting station, he claimed that the Duke of Windsor is interested in accepting a certain position in Hollywood, with an annual salary of US$100,000. According to Fischer, this amount is enough to make the Duke no longer rely on the British royal family's financial support. (National Telegraph, 10th)

### Kong Xiangxi Meets with a Japanese Reporter Before Leaving Singapore

Tells Them Unless Japan Withdraws Its Troops, China's Resistance Will Not Stop

⊙Singapore – Yesterday, Kong Xiangxi, the Deputy Executive Yuan President and Minister of Finance of China, arrived here en route to returning to China. Today, he resumed his voyage on the same ship. While he was in Singapore, saying farewell to friends, a Japanese man approached Kong. The atmosphere suddenly became tense. After Kong learned that the Japanese man was a reporter from a local Japanese newspaper, he disregarded the advice of those around him and met with the Japanese man frankly. Afterwards, Kong told a Reuters reporter, "I told him that if Japan withdraws its troops first, China will also immediately stop the war." Kong also said that the Japanese reporter shook hands with him and bowed respectfully before leaving. When Kong arrived here yesterday, the local overseas Chinese turned out in droves to welcome him, singing the national anthem loudly. Among those welcoming him were representatives of the British government and the Italian consul. Later, Kong accepted an invitation from Governor Thomas for lunch at the Governor's Mansion.

### The Issue of Non-Interference in the Spanish Civil War Causes Renewed Tension in Europe

Britain and France Carefully Consider Their Future Stance; Unlikely to Adopt Retaliatory Measures Against Italy

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain attended a cabinet subcommittee meeting this morning, serving as chairman, to prepare for the resumption of Parliament. It is generally believed that the Prime Minister discussed the Italian government's response to the issue of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War with cabinet members and decided to discuss it at the regular cabinet meeting this Wednesday. Regarding this matter, the government is not expected to take any action before Foreign Secretary Eden returns to London tomorrow and the cabinet holds its regular meeting. (Central News Agency, 11th, Geneva dispatch)

[Paris] Regarding the issue of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos held a meeting this afternoon, which lasted for a long time.

In addition, the French ambassador to Germany returned here from Berlin this morning. (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas dispatch)

[Paris] Britain has invited countries of the Non-Intervention Committee to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the "very urgent" issue of withdrawing Spanish volunteers. The French government received this invitation today, indicating that Britain and France do not intend to take retaliatory measures immediately. It is reported that Britain insists on using diplomatic means for mediation. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has asked France to delay opening the French-Spanish border. It is reported that Mussolini has conscripted three classes of soldiers from 1907, 1908, and 1909, preparing to mobilize at any time. In view of this situation, Britain must be somewhat cautious.

### Britain Expresses Dissatisfaction with Italy's Response

Believes it Lacks Constructiveness

[London] British officials have expressed dissatisfaction with Italy's response regarding the Spanish issue, believing that it completely lacks constructiveness and does not contribute to easing the tense situation in the Mediterranean. Moreover, Italy refused to participate in the initial discussions of the three-nation conference, only advocating for the matter to be handled by the Non-Intervention Committee, which is particularly regrettable. The purpose of the British and French proposals was to seek an early resolution of the issue. If a general solution could be reached, the Non-Intervention Committee could then formulate detailed measures. Now, Britain and France both feel that the Spanish issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible, but Italy, citing Germany's lack of invitation, has rejected this new path to resolution, which is disappointing. Furthermore, there is much speculation here about whether Italy will apply the same principle of refusing to participate in meetings to which Germany is not invited to all future meetings, such as the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the Far East. The future of the Mediterranean issue depends on whether the rumors of Italy sending more troops to Spain are true. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters dispatch)

### Foreign Observer Discusses Internal Strife Between Military and Government in Japan

Hopes for an Early End to the War Against China; If It Is Prolonged, the Japanese Government Will Collapse

[Nanjing] According to a foreign observer who came to China from Tokyo, Japan's invasion of China this time has been futile, the people are resentful, and the military's prestige has been swept away. They blame the Foreign Ministry for not fulfilling its responsibilities in diplomatic attacks, causing the sacrifice of Japanese soldiers' blood and flesh and being condemned internationally. Foreign Minister Hirota is extremely embarrassed. Radical elements in the military have also attacked General Matsui, who commands in Shanghai, saying that the wording of his announcements in Shanghai was inappropriate, obviously implying that the Japanese army must rely on the assistance of the local people, which violates the spirit of the Imperial Army and exposes its weaknesses, and he should be held responsible. Now, the military's paper tiger has been punctured, and the financial circles are extremely dissatisfied. When the Japanese army first launched the war of aggression against China, the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu originally agreed to temporarily sacrifice its trade in China, and then settle accounts with the government later. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army's war in Shanghai has been failing steadily, and they can no longer endure the pain. They accuse the military of being fooled. The Imperial Household is deeply afraid of the growing instability within the country and has summoned Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in, the Emperor's uncle, for several days to inquire about the situation and question the state of affairs. Therefore, the military's only hope now is to achieve a clear victory in northern China and Shanghai before the end of this year and occupy Hainan Island, so as to be able to shirk responsibility to all parties. Takehara, the head of the Japanese army's press corps, recently gave a public speech, suddenly abandoning his long-held argument that China must be thoroughly punished, saying that the Japanese army in North China is now looking for a fierce battle with the main Chinese forces and will end it immediately. If the Chinese authorities are willing to cooperate sincerely, they can still work together. This shows that the Japanese have exhausted their strength day by day, and the military also knows that the war against China must be ended quickly. If China can prolong the resistance, the violent Japanese government will inevitably collapse. It is said that the Japanese parliament will meet in December this year. If the war against China is not over by then, there is talk of Mizuno Rentaro reorganizing a new cabinet. The foreign observer continued, "In order to mend the internal strife among young soldiers, the Japanese military authorities released Major General Masaki and others, key figures in the February 26 Incident. Recently, they transferred Rear Admiral Koumi, the director of the Military Affairs Bureau, who handled the case and had a long-standing feud with Masaki, to the Shanghai area and replaced him with Machijiri, who is of the National Polity Clarification faction, in order to adapt to the current situation." The foreign observer also said that according to recent reports in the Teito Nichinichi Shimbun, the three newspaper companies, Asahi Shimbun, Nichinichi Shimbun, and Yomiuri Shimbun, have been competing to have their overseas correspondents interview key figures from various countries, using international telephones to collect information, since the Lugouqiao Incident, which has been unanimously rejected by all parties. Even knowledgeable Japanese people do not approve of this rogue behavior. It is also heard that much of the content of the reports from the American International News Service, which is a special correspondent for the Yomiuri Shimbun, is anti-Japanese news. The Yomiuri Shimbun feels that it cannot be adopted and only adopts its news articles that are unrelated to Japan." (11th, Central News Agency dispatch)

Current Commentary

### The Storms of Western Europe

— Yi

During this critical period of national survival and all-out resistance, the fate of the Spanish people in distant Europe is also worthy of our constant concern.

The Spanish war is nominally a civil war, but in reality, it is the same as our country. It is a war of resistance against foreign aggression. This has become an indisputable fact. Because if the two European powers did not fully assist Franco, the rebellion could have been quelled long ago.

Not only that, but the Spanish war and the Sino-Japanese war are mutually reinforcing. This time, the Japanese invaders are not hesitating to offend the public anger of the great powers and are carrying out a large-scale invasion of our country. This is because they want to take advantage of the good opportunity of trouble in Western Europe. Now the great powers are beginning to support our country. The international situation in Western Europe is also becoming tense. The Italian government recently refused to negotiate with Britain and France on the issue of non-interference in Spain. And openly continued to send reinforcements to Spain to help in the war. And a transport ship of the Spanish government was sunk by two destroyers of unknown nationality. These news items may seem to have little to do with us on the surface. If you investigate further. You can know that a certain country is trying to contain the attention of Britain and France to the Far East. The storms of Western Europe are also being stirred up.

The storms of Western Europe were indeed calm for a while after the Nyon Conference. And the Nyon Conference was undoubtedly quite successful. We also demand at least the same degree of success for the upcoming Brussels Conference.

### Welcome Special Products from Various Provinces to Offset Purchases of National Salvation Bonds

Grains, Cotton, Cloth, Furs, and Other Items; And Wartime Necessities Can All Be Used to Offset Purchases; Bond Certificates Printed and Part Issued on National Day

A Central News Agency reporter spoke with the person in charge of the National Salvation Bonds Solicitation General Association yesterday, who stated the main points regarding the acceptance of special products from various provinces to offset purchases of National Salvation Bonds. While the solicitation of National Salvation Bonds primarily involves gold, silver, and national currency, commodities such as grains, cotton, and cloth produced in nearby provinces, as well as furs, wartime necessities, and other special products from remote provinces are equally welcome and needed. Yesterday, the General Association received a telegram from Ma Hongkui of Ningxia Province stating that in addition to subscribing with national currency, they would also use special products such as furs from Ningxia Province to offset the price for purchasing bonds. The General Association replied by telegram, expressing strong approval. Today, a telegram was received from Chairman Ma stating that the goods would be transported to Shanghai soon. Provinces across the country with special products and wartime necessities may wish to follow suit and use them to offset purchases of National Salvation Bonds.

Furthermore, according to the Solicitation General Association, the bond certificates have already been printed by the Ministry of Finance and are being distributed to prepare for delivery to various receiving agencies for exchange and issuance. It is also heard that in order to encourage public subscription, the association specially issued 100,000 yuan worth of five-yuan and ten-yuan certificates to the post office on Double Tenth Day to be distributed to postmen for solicitation from citizens in the city.

### Korean National Revolutionary Party Comforts Soldiers

Saving Money and Food to Collect Over 100 Yuan to Express Sincere Enthusiasm for Resisting the Enemy

The Shanghai Special District of the Korean National Revolutionary Party collected 121 yuan and 30 cents yesterday to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and make cotton vests for them. The original letter stated, "Greetings, our Korean people have suffered the misery of national subjugation for more than 30 years. During this period, we have lived under the iron heel of the robber Japanese imperialism every day. The suffering we have suffered is beyond words. The restriction of action, the suppression of thought, the insufficiency of a lost nation, and the desire to exterminate the race have forced all of our compatriots who have a little knowledge and a little awareness to flee overseas. What is the injury and death of a country lost and a family lost? Fortunately, the human heart has not died, and the desire to avenge and restore the country has not been forgotten. Therefore, we have struggled with the violent sun for many years, and those who have fallen one after another and made heroic sacrifices are like raging tides, which cannot be stopped. Since the opening of the anti-Japanese war at Lugouqiao, the Songhu War has aroused the supreme enthusiasm of our Korean people, peeling the skin of the Japanese thieves and eating their flesh. It is true that they have been subjected to inhuman oppression on weekdays. The old enmity of more than 30 years of accumulation is extremely eager to be relieved. In addition to awakening our Korean people at home and abroad to unite and be willing to be jade broken rather than tile complete, we have now collected 121 yuan and 30 cents of national currency from the overseas Chinese in Shanghai who save money and food or pledge their clothes, and sent it through your association to the anti-Japanese soldiers in front, so as to express our condolences. Although the amount is small, it is also to show the sincere enthusiasm for resisting the enemy. In the future, we will continue to collect money to make up for the lack. Unfortunately, the overseas Chinese in Shanghai are all fugitives. They usually suffer from unemployment. During this war, their lives are tight, which can be imagined. I hope you will understand and convey this intention to your compatriots to express the common struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples. I wish you victory in the anti-Japanese war.

### Circulation of Remittance Instruments Revitalizes Finance

Increase in Bank Deposits; Financial Stability Absolute

A reporter from Xin Xin She recently spoke with a magnate in the banking industry who stated that under the war of resistance situation, Shanghai, the financial center of our country, has extremely stable finances overall. It is said that after the outbreak of the August 13th War, fortunately, our financial authorities promulgated seven measures to stabilize finances during this extraordinary period. From August 16th, the withdrawal of deposits was limited to 5% per week, and the banking industry formulated four supplementary measures. Although it is impossible to withdraw legal tender beyond 5% of deposits, checks and bank drafts can still be used for payment and transfer of accounts. This method of using instruments instead of cash activates finance and is quite effective. After all, banks act as agents for society to transfer accounts with each other, which is one of their duties. The payer issues a check, and the payee mostly deposits it into the bank. The payment relationship between the two parties is handled by the bank transferring the account on the book, so it is not necessary to pay with cash. Now, although the withdrawal of cash is restricted, the public can still use instruments to pay and receive payments as usual, so the financial market is still active and unimpeded. Furthermore, the instruments used by Chinese banks are originally divided into two types: cash (which can be paid on the same day) and remittance (which is limited to payment on the next day for interbank transfers). Although the names still exist, because of the restrictions on withdrawals, the instruments used have also become remittance in nature. The scope of remittance has therefore expanded. The purpose of interbank remittance is to save cash. If it can be expanded and applied to the whole country, the function of account clearing will be even greater. Furthermore, since last month, the deposits received by various banks have become active again. It is expected that from now on, the amount of deposits will gradually increase. This is enough to show the people's performance in the long-term war of resistance.

### Wartime Elementary Schools

Decision to Establish Ten Schools First; Sponsored by the Vocational Education Committee

The Shanghai Education Association believes that education work during the war of resistance should adapt to the needs of this time and place. The association's board of directors resolved to establish a Wartime Education Committee, nominating board members Feng Yixian, Wang Longzhang, and Xu Jinshen as members, and nominating board member Feng Yixian to preside over everything. It is heard that the committee has decided to first establish ten wartime elementary schools and then gradually increase the number. The abbreviated rules for the wartime elementary schools sponsored by the association are recorded below: ㊀ The association will first establish ten wartime elementary schools to remedy the large number of poor and out-of-school children during the war. ㊁ The names of the wartime elementary schools will be determined by the order of establishment, such as the Fourth Wartime Elementary School sponsored by the Shanghai Education Association. ㊂ The school sites of the wartime elementary schools will be attached to public and private schools in the First and Second Special Districts, as determined by the association. ㊃ The principals of the wartime elementary schools will be concurrently appointed by the association from the original principals. ㊄ The teachers of the wartime elementary schools must be unemployed teachers from public and private elementary schools in the war zone. ㊅ The subjects of the wartime elementary schools will be based on national arithmetic and will focus on wartime common sense. The details will be determined separately. ㊆ The teaching time of the wartime elementary schools will be three hours in principle. The schedule can be freely arranged by each school and reported to the association for approval. ㊇ The tuition fee for wartime elementary schools is set at one yuan per person per month. No other fees will be charged. ㊈ The books and school supplies for wartime elementary schools will be provided by the students themselves. ㊉ If there are any imperfections in these rules, they may be amended at any time. ㊉㊀ These rules will be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs.

### Patriotism in Minzhi Elementary and Middle School

Minzhi Elementary and Middle School on Weihaiwei Road has consistently contributed to the anti-Japanese righteous forces in the past, during the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and the Suiyuan War. This time, all teachers, students, and staff are even more aware that the War of Resistance is related to the survival of the nation, and national salvation brooks no delay. Therefore, in addition to sheltering refugees and donating to military needs, they have recently continued to work hard to follow the three national celebration campaigns in the city. Public bonds worth 4,000 yuan have been collected, and 12 male and female staff members have each purchased bonds worth 5 or 10 yuan, which is particularly commendable. 1,225 silk cotton vests have been donated, 1,000 of which were made with cloth provided by the Cotton Cloth Association.

Our army calmly resisted, firmly guarding the front line, and the enemy was ultimately unable to succeed. Before dawn this morning, our army was ordered to counterattack. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy finally collapsed and was repelled to the shore area. ㊂ On the Liuheng-Dachang highway, last night the enemy concentrated its firepower and launched a full-scale attack, which was fiercely repelled by our army. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Tangqiao. ㊃ Yesterday morning, four enemy transport ships arrived at Yangshupu and Huishan Wharf.

A Central News Agency military reporter reported at 9:45 a.m. on the 12th that the enemy, which had previously crossed from Jiangjiazhai to the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal, was met with a brave counterattack by our army and surrounded on three sides. Last night, they attempted to break out of the encirclement and bombarded our positions with intense artillery fire all night, attempting to destroy our fortifications. We responded with a full-scale offensive, but after a fierce battle that lasted half the night, the enemy was unable to withstand it and collapsed, retreating towards Tangqiao. At dawn this morning, the enemy stirred again. Our army immediately launched a dense machine gun barrage and threw hand grenades fiercely. The enemy was unable to cross the border. At the time of the report, the battle was still ongoing. Furthermore, the remaining enemy in the Gujiazhai area was once again attacked by our army at dawn this morning, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The enemy lay in wait within the village, not daring to attack. Our army is determined to punish them severely and completely eliminate them as soon as possible.

### Enemy Attempts to Land at Liuhe Again

Four Attempts to Invade Fail

Dozens of enemy ships suddenly sailed to the outside of the Liuhekou estuary on the 10th, one after another, and gathered there. Our army had long known that the enemy had another attempt to land, so they were heavily guarded. After 6 p.m. last night, the enemy divided its troops and boarded multiple small boats. Under the cover of naval artillery, they continuously invaded Maqiaokou, Luhangkou, Yanglinkou, and other places, reaching four times in total, but all failed.

### The Enemy in Jiangwan Attacks Repeatedly, Suffering Casualties

A Central News Agency military reporter reported at 9:45 a.m. on the 12th that from last night until this morning, the enemy repeatedly attacked our army's positions at Fudan University, Liangjiang Women's Gymnasium, Jiangwan Racecourse, and Nantianlu Temple. After our brave counterattack, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and was finally repelled. As for the Miaohang area, there was no contact with our front-line positions from last night until this morning. The front line was relatively quiet.

### Our Army in Zhabei Launches Three-Pronged Attack on Enemy

A Central News Agency Zhabei military reporter reported at 12:30 p.m. on the 12th that the street fighting in Guangdong Street, Dongbaoxing Road, and other places was intermittent. By 3 a.m. this morning, the enemy had suffered more than 130 casualties and completely retreated. Our army then launched a dawn attack at around 4 a.m., before daybreak. One route attacked from Tan Jiazhai, Chizhi University, Guangdong Middle School, and Shui Dian Road, attacking the Patriotic Girls' School. Another route attacked from Guangli Road, flanking the enemy forces at the 63rd Flower Garden. At the same time, the Baziqiao area also attacked from Liuying Road, storming the Japanese Cemetery. Multiple enemy tanks fired back and forth on Jiangwan Road, covering their infantry and stubbornly resisting. However, our army rose and fell, unpredictable. The enemy forces were unable to cope. By 9 a.m., the enemy had suffered more than 150 casualties. Subsequently, enemy aircraft were dispatched, and our army retreated to defend various strongholds. The battle then ended. Furthermore, the enemy forces attacking Jiangwan were completely repelled by 5:30 a.m. During this battle, our flat-trajectory guns unleashed their firepower, destroying two enemy vehicles and killing 60 to 70 enemy soldiers.

### Enemy Aircraft Fly to Zhabei to Ravage

Bombing in Yangjiadu and Zhangjiabang, Large Aircraft Fly to Zhabei to Drop Bombs

At 8:30 a.m. this morning, six enemy aircraft flew out again and bombed the Yangjiadu and Zhangjiabang areas of Pudong, dropping more than a dozen bombs. Because they were indiscriminate, and because Pudong has many fields and the ground has been softened by the continuous heavy rain, the bombs did not explode. Subsequently, three large aircraft circled over Nanshi, flying low to reconnoiter and strafing with machine guns.

At noon today, three enemy large bombers flew in formation over Zhabei, bombing Baoshan Road and the North Railway Station with great force. After the three aircraft dropped bombs at the same time, they circled from the eastern district of Hongkou to Pudong and returned to the original location to drop bombs, with the sound shaking the entire city. This was repeated more than a dozen times, and about 40 to 50 bombs were dropped.

Furthermore, it is reported that from 11 a.m. today, 16 enemy bombers of various sizes bombed Zhabei everywhere, attempting to destroy our defensive fortifications. However, the bombs they dropped only destroyed civilian houses and did no damage to our military.

### Enemy Troops Called in Are All Reserve Soldiers

A Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou on the 11th reported that the enemy has called in several batches of reinforcements from the country, all of whom are reserve soldiers. Their combat capabilities are quite weak, and they were conscripted into the army, so their morale is even more demoralized.

### The Enemy Plots Greatly in Pudong, Both Sides in a State of Artillery Battle

Our Enemy Opened Fire and Bombed Each Other This Morning

The entire Pudong front line is now completely engaged in an artillery battle with enemy ships on the Huangpu River. Since the enemy's positions and military supplies warehouses in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, as well as several warships, have been repeatedly heavily damaged by our brave artillerymen who have accurately aimed, the enemy has suffered heavy losses and is eager to retaliate. Therefore, yesterday, each ship fired all night and strafed the Pudong shoreline with machine guns. Our artillery team launched a heavy artillery attack, with strong firepower, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Since this morning, enemy ships have frequently fired and bombarded, and our army has also counterattacked intermittently, with the sound of artillery fire sometimes dense and sometimes sparse, until noon without ceasing. Most of the enemy shells landed in the open field, and our side did not suffer any damage.

Furthermore, it is reported that our Pudong artillery learned that the enemy would have a large amount of military supplies loaded and unloaded in the Yangshupu area. Therefore, from 11:30 p.m. last night to 5:30 a.m. this morning, they launched a fierce artillery attack on the enemy's positions in the Yangshupu and Huishan areas. Enemy ships in the Huangpu River simultaneously returned fire on our Pudong. There was also fierce fighting in the Zhabei Baoshan Road area and the Dachang area, with the sound of gunfire and artillery fire, interspersed with the sound of hand grenades. At dawn today, enemy ships in the Huangpu River fired on the Zhaoshang Wharf in Pudong. At the same time, there was artillery fire at the intersection of Bazilu, North Jiangxi Road.

Enemy Aircraft Massacre Innocent Civilians

The enemy now knows that it is not easy to attack the Pudong positions. In addition to firing artillery day and night to resist our artillery team, they used more than a dozen bombers to bomb and destroy from the afternoon of yesterday. However, because there was no target at all, they indiscriminately bombed innocent civilians and houses. An investigation revealed that several people, including Zhao Shutang from Ningbo, Lu Baomei, a woman from Jiangbei, Lu Cao Shi, a local woman, Lu Baobao, a local boy, Lu Huang Shi, a local woman, Wang Shi, a woman from Shandong, Wang Jinxiang, a girl, and Wang Ada, a local man, were injured by shrapnel. In addition, seven bombs were dropped on the Pudong Electric Company in Zhangjiabang, but because the target was inaccurate, only two staff dormitories, 15 flat houses in a nearby winery, and 7 to 8 civilian houses around were destroyed. At 8 a.m. this morning, more than a dozen enemy heavy bombers concentrated on Jinjia Lane and Qian Langzhong Bridge in the eastern section of Yangjing, and indiscriminately bombed farmers' villages, destroying many. Fortunately, the farmers scattered and fled, and only a few were injured. This kind of atrocity by enemy aircraft can only massacre a few of our civilians and has no military damage.

### 3,000 Enemy Soldiers Who Secretly Crossed Wenzaobang to the South Bank Annihilated

Corpses Lay Everywhere, River Water All Red

After the enemy's fourth general offensive was severely suppressed by our army in separate attacks in recent days, it has obviously become an illusion again. According to military sources this morning, the enemy's attacking force this time was fully equipped with 100,000 soldiers. Thanks to our loyal and brave soldiers who fought bravely and were not taken advantage of. It is estimated that the enemy's casualties in this battle amounted to 7,000 to 8,000 soldiers. In the battle of secretly crossing the south bank of Wenzaobang, more than 3,000 enemy soldiers have been annihilated by our army. The river water is all red, and corpses lay everywhere. The enemy soldiers in that area have now been surrounded on three sides by our army and are being driven back and suppressed to the shore. It is not difficult to eliminate them all. In the Liuheng area, our army has approached the vicinity of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. As for the rubber boats used by the enemy to cross the river, 30 or more have been destroyed or captured by us in the past ten days and have been successively transported to the rear. As for the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas, the enemy has gained nothing and has been repeatedly heavily damaged by our army. Therefore, the enemy dares not attack again and sent its aircraft to bomb them from the afternoon of yesterday, but it has absolutely no impact on our military.

### Negotiations on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Are Progressing Smoothly

U.S. Secretary of State Issues Statement, Venue of Conference Decided in Brussels

[Washington] Regarding the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers, saying that discussions between the relevant countries are progressing smoothly, but the venue and date of the conference have not yet been determined. In addition, Belgian Ambassador to the United States, Mr. van Dooslaere, met with State Department Assistant Secretary Wilson today, but it is reported that the discussion did not involve the issue of selecting Brussels, Belgium as the venue for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, Havana, November 11)

⊙Brussels Regarding the convening of the future Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Belgian government seems prepared to accept this city as the venue, but because King Leopold III and Prime Minister Janson are not in the capital, officials are currently being absolutely conservative and silent. (Central News Agency, Havana, November 11)

☉Brussels It was previously rumored that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the Far East would be held in Brussels. Now it has been largely decided, and the conference period will be approximately within two weeks. The United States has also virtually agreed to send representatives to participate. In Brussels, the selection of the venue is greatly welcomed, because although Belgium has extensive commercial treaty relations with China, it has no political intentions. For example, Belgium has long abandoned the Belgian concession in Tianjin. This can greatly guarantee the neutrality of the venue. Furthermore, Belgium is not a signatory country of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Central News Agency, Reuters, November 12)

### Britain and France Consult on How to Deal with the Spanish Problem

Submitted to Cabinet Meeting for Final Decision, Also Planning to Open Non-Intervention Committee

[London] After Italy refused to hold talks with Britain and France to discuss the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the British and French authorities began talks today to discuss how to deal with the situation. French Ambassador Corbin held a long talk with Sir William Strang, Permanent Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office, but its exact content was not revealed. Observers in British political circles believe that the current situation can be compared to the relations between Britain and Italy during the war between Italy and Abyssinia. In particular, Italy's recent repeated dispatch of troops to Italian Libya in North Africa has made the British side feel uneasy. In addition, the situation of Italian activities on the Balearic Islands, a Spanish territory in the Mediterranean, has also caused anxiety. Some people have proposed to suggest to the relevant countries that these islands should be placed under international joint administration in order to internationalize them, and Italy should also participate in this matter. It is generally believed that the British Cabinet will discuss the issue of Italy's increase in troops to Libya and the Balearic Islands at its regular meeting on Wednesday. (Central News Agency, November 11)

[Paris] Officials here recently believed that this move by Italy was tantamount to refusing to withdraw Italian volunteers from Spain. Foreign Minister Delbos held a long talk with Prime Minister Chautemps and Deputy Prime Minister Blum today, and subsequently received British Ambassador Sir Phipps. What was discussed was the situation caused by this move by Italy and how to deal with it. In general, France's position must be decided in a few days, or it may be decided at the regular Cabinet meeting on Thursday (the day after the British Cabinet meeting). (Central News Agency, Havas, November 11)

[London] Regarding the Spanish problem, diplomatic circles here generally believe that after consultations between Britain and France, they will convene the London Adjustment Committee at the end of this week or the beginning of next week to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries from Spain in order to meet Italy's demands. However, if the relevant countries still cannot reach a compromise, then Britain and France should make each country aware of its responsibilities and take action. (Central News Agency, Reuters, November 11)

### First Special Court Docket Reduced

After the Shanghai war, the original site of the First Special District Court was often hit by stray bullets, which was very dangerous. Therefore, it was temporarily moved to the Tongyi Trust Company on Beijing Road, and then moved to the Zhirenyong Girls' School on Weihaiwei Road. However, in peacetime, the court heard cases, both civil and criminal courts, a total of 14 courts, which were heard in the morning and afternoon, and there were still concerns about being insufficient. Every day, the number of civil and criminal cases that needed to be heard must reach 100 or 200 or more. But now it is very different from the past. Due to the location of the court, there are only two criminal cases. On the busiest days, there are only about 20 cases, which is only about one-third of the previous number. Civil cases are also very rare. Therefore, although 12 courts have been reduced, there is still no feeling of difficulty in hearing cases.

### Enemy Invasion of Jinpu Line Unsuccessful, Our Armored Train Advances North from Pingyuan

[Zhengzhou] Seven enemy aircraft dropped eight bombs on Shunde on the 11th, causing slight damage to the vicinity of the station. Enemy aircraft have been discovered dropping bombs in Anyang and Gaoyi for several days, and the tracks have been damaged. (Central News Agency, 11th)

[Jinan] After the enemy's main force arrived in Dezhou on the Jinpu Line, they have not dared to advance again. They have only sent plainclothes teams and small units of cavalry to disrupt the area several times, but they have been repelled by our guard troops. The enemy and us are still facing each other across the old Yellow River. Our armored train has now opened up seven or eight miles north of Pingyuan, preparing to repair the old Yellow River bridge and advance. It is raining today, and enemy aircraft have not come to attack. (Special dispatch, 11th)

### Commander Yang Hu's Wife Presents Flowers to Comfort Wounded Soldiers

— (International Press)

### Two Types of Diaries Found Among Enemy Corpses in Luodian

Proving Heavy Enemy Casualties and Hatred of War

A few days ago, in a certain place near Luodian, the enemy attempted to launch a sneak attack, but was severely attacked by our army. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and corpses lay everywhere. In addition to obtaining a large number of spoils of war, our army also found many diaries among the enemy corpses. Most of the records were about the course of the battle and personal feelings. The following is a translation of two of the more important ones:

First

In the diary of a squad leader, a second lieutenant, it was recorded that on October 2, the second lieutenant led 49 soldiers (19 of whom were temporarily conscripted) to attack our XX position, and Captain Chi Tian, the squadron leader, supervised the battle. Although the enemy was stubborn, after our brave counterattack, the result was that Chi Tian's head was pierced, eight first-class soldiers died in battle, and 17 were injured. Proportionally speaking, the enemy's casualties in this battle must exceed more than half. The diary recorded the reasons for its failure as follows: ㊀ Overly underestimating our army, ㊁ Reconnaissance of our army's situation and terrain, especially unfamiliar with the terrain. After attacking forward, they realized the front of the barbed wire fence. ㊂ Lack of MG (machine guns), which failed to prevent our army from advancing. From this, we can not only see the enemy's recklessness in combat, but also see the severity of their casualties.

Second

There is also a soldier's diary whose name is unknown. The letter written to his mother is excerpted as follows: After parting, I boarded a ship to Shanghai and landed at dawn. I stretched my legs in the fire. I rushed to the first line, so I was too busy to write a letter to express my apologies. I believe my mother must be heartbroken. The sound of artillery fire here is like dropping beans all day long. The enemy (referring to our army) is clearly and gradually getting closer. Before long, the first victims were seen, which was a strange and annoying feeling. After two or three days, the army flag guard squad was wiped out. Although I have witnessed all kinds of dangers, fortunately I have been protected by the guardian gods and survived. Since entering Luodian, there are still residents who have not yet moved away. It is most appropriate to bind them out of their homes one by one and shoot them. I witnessed this tragic situation and was really moved and uneasy. If there is karma, and the enemy comes to our country in the future, will our innocent people also suffer this tragic encounter?

### Pudong Cotton Marketing Association Begins to Purchase New Cotton

Membership Fund Deadline at the End of the Month

In order to help cotton farmers, the Pudong Native Association has, in addition to negotiating a new cotton mortgage method with the Bank of China, also invited cotton merchants and ginning factories to form the Pudong Cotton Transportation and Marketing Association, which specializes in purchasing new cotton from various counties in Pudong. The association has now started working. Regarding the membership fund, it has been decided by the Standing Committee that payment will be made from today until October 31. The Pudong Second Bank of China Exchange is designated to collect the funds. At the same time, it will begin to purchase new cotton. The transportation of the cotton received will be as safe as possible. After the cotton is transported to Shanghai, it will be mortgaged to the agreed-upon bank for cash. It is reported that the price of new cotton in Pudong is currently about eight yuan per load.

### Jiangshui Falls Greatly, This Year's Great Flood Passes

Flood in the Yangtze River is Safe, Hurricane Season is also About to Pass

According to news from the Jianghai Customs Inspectorate, the Yangtze River has greatly decreased in water volume recently, and the reason is that the great flood has passed, which is really good news. The details are as follows:

Safe Passage of the Yangtze River Flood Season

According to the latest water level reports from along the Yangtze River received by the Patrol Engineering Department, Yichang is at 31 feet, Hankou is at 47 feet, Jiujiang is at 42 feet 1, Anqing is at 39 feet, Wuhu is at 37 feet 5, and Zhenjiang is at 17 feet 9. The situation has greatly eased. During this period when the great flood has passed, it is hoped that the river water will decrease rather than increase. This year's flood along the Yangtze River can fortunately be avoided.

Hurricane Season is About to Pass

According to news from the Observatory, the Central Meteorological Institute also believes that the hurricane season is about to pass, and the coast of China can avoid attacks. Therefore, from the end of this month, it will no longer broadcast hurricane warnings to various coastal radio stations such as Shanghai. The Observatory will also stop showing the direction of hurricane progress from this month. In general, these two pieces of news are great news for residents along the Yangtze River and coast, as well as the navigation industry.

### Hong Kong Relief Team

To Come to Shanghai to Serve on the Front Lines

Since the start of our all-out resistance against the enemy, overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have been extremely enthusiastic. Various groups in Hong Kong have also been working hard on relief efforts. Mr. Jian Youwen, a member of the Legislative Yuan, recently sent a letter to several people in this city, stating that the "Youth Circle of Hong Kong has recently organized the China Youth Relief Team." The team consists of twenty members and plans to be led by Mr. Jian to Shanghai to participate in frontline work. They are expected to depart within days.

### Brief Commentary

— Phase

Allied Press Tokyo, 11th dispatch. It is said that the enemy army, with lightning speed attacks, was fortunate to capture Shijiazhuang on the 10th. Yesterday was China's Double Tenth Festival. This matter feels quite sarcastic. However, according to our country's authorities, as of 6 p.m. on the 11th, they were still receiving telephone calls from the location. Thus the claim that the enemy occupied Shijiazhuang at 2 p.m. on the 10th is completely inaccurate. It is clearly a fabrication by the enemy to claim credit. The Tokyo authorities are thus rather delighted for nothing.

The enemy forces in Shanghai have made boastful statements, saying that before the Double Tenth Festival, the enemy would definitely reach a certain destination. However, on the Double Tenth Festival, I waited a whole day and heard no news of the enemy reaching that location. I thought it might be too late for the Double Tenth Festival, but perhaps they would arrive the next day. But the next day, I waited another whole day and still heard no news. Today is already October 12th. Perhaps it will have to wait until next year's Double Tenth Festival.

The enemy's propaganda skills are truly admirable. Our country cannot even come close.

### Enemy Consumes 100,000 Tons of Ammunition in Two Weeks

Idle Dreams of Occupying Zhabei on the Double Tenth Festival

The Battle of Shanghai has lasted for sixty days. The enemy is operating in Shanghai, with 112 powerful naval warships that are sufficient to threaten our army. In terms of actual wartime value, they have lost their effectiveness because the main guns of the naval ships are essentially useless. Therefore, in the past half month, the enemy has desperately increased the number of elite ground troops sent to Shanghai from their homeland. Within two weeks, artillery, cavalry, infantry, and engineering units have been transferred, surpassing the Second Division. About one-third of the naval ships in Shanghai have been left between Shanghai, Liuhang, and Wusong, while the remaining two-thirds have been dispatched to the Yangtze River, Haizhou, Lianyungang, and Dapu, and others have sailed to various locations along the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, attempting to create disturbances. Our side has already discerned their hidden schemes. The coastal defenses of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are strong, and the enemy ships have no ability to operate. It is now known that key ports such as Liezikou, Chenjiagang, and Dapu Port have been blocked by our side for days, and they have been blockaded. Therefore, the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are as solid as a rock. As for the enemy warships between Shanghai, from the Sanxia waters, Litongsha waters, to the Waibaidu Bridge in the Huangpu River, there are now only about thirty large and small warships, including those in Liuhang and the Yangtze River estuary.

In the past two weeks, the enemy's transport ships have been arriving in Shanghai continuously, loaded with ammunition, supplies, artillery shells, bombs, etc. On average, three ships arrive in Shanghai every day, with each ship carrying between 2,000 and 4,000 tons of ammunition. This means that on average, 6,000 to 8,000 tons arrive per day. According to an estimate by a certain Westerner yesterday, the enemy has transported at least 80,000 to 100,000 tons of ammunition and military equipment to Shanghai in these two weeks, and over 60% of it has already been consumed without any gains in the war. This has greatly worried the Japanese military authorities. People from various countries also praise the Chinese army's ability to respond effectively, viewing the enemy's massive artillery fire as insignificant. This is enough to win praise from military experts around the world.

This time, the Japanese army's offensive in Shanghai began on September 29. The Japanese army's elite troops had arrived, and their newest artillery and giant heavy bombers had also been transported. They were prepared to use 80,000 to 100,000 tons of artillery ammunition and concentrate their forces to "attack resolutely." Hence, they declared that they would capture Zhabei before the Double Tenth Festival. Attacking this corner of land with such strong troops and weapons, they could indeed achieve their expectations. According to a rough estimate by a military expert in Shanghai, since September 29, the Japanese army has been using giant heavy bombers and 8-inch caliber artillery, dropping bombs (all giant bombs weighing 500 pounds) and firing artillery shells every day on the Zhabei and Liuhang lines. On one particular day, in Zhabei alone, over 600 tons of bombs were dropped, which is enough to shock the world. Moreover, on that day, over 1,000 artillery shells were fired, and the Chinese army was able to withstand it and defend it, which is even more difficult than during the European war.

Based on this calculation, the 100,000 tons of artillery ammunition that Japan transported within half a month were almost completely wasted by the Double Tenth Festival, and Zhabei is still in the hands of the Chinese army. We are not surprised by Japan's insane bombing and reckless use of artillery fire, but what is surprising is that the Chinese army was able to withstand 100,000 tons of bombing ammunition in a short period of two weeks, maintaining the front line without any damage. Then, the western front of the European war, "The Battle of the Marne, which shocked the world," its honor has been taken by the Chinese army in the Battle of Zhabei.

### Overseas Chinese in Australia Concerned About National Crisis, Long-Term Fundraising

The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China in this city received a letter yesterday from the Macau Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, stating: "In reply, we received your telegram No. 32 dated August 24, and we deeply understand that the enemy is invading our country, acting violently and rampantly, and that the wounded soldiers and refugees are suffering terribly. At this critical moment for the survival of the nation, all citizens should unite and prepare to save the country. Every time the overseas Chinese think of our country's danger, the soldiers' bloody battles, and the innocent refugees' suffering, we feel deeply pained. Since the start of the Shanghai battle, the Macau compatriots have quickly organized the Macau All-Circles Disaster Relief Association, which is fundraising long-term to fulfill a citizen's duty. Macau is located in a remote corner, and its commerce is not large. Its financial resources are far from being as thick as those of the interport areas, but the overseas Chinese compatriots' deep understanding of patriotism is not behind anyone. Since its organization, it has remitted donations to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for distribution. As the war extends and the need for assistance increases, our overseas Chinese compatriots' donation work cannot be slackened. We will certainly work hard to be the country's support and live up to our mission. We hope you will provide guidance from time to time so that we can follow it."

### Shanghai Radio Station's New Broadcasting Programs

The Shanghai Radio Station (970 kHz) has been striving to adapt to broadcasting during this extraordinary period since the August 13th war. Such as the wartime education of the Bureau of Social Affairs, the wartime knowledge of the Bureau of Health and the Shanghai Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps, and the lectures of the Shanghai Gazetteer, and the English news of the Municipal Government. They have been able to instill the necessary wartime knowledge to the public. Now, the station also plans to invite well-known figures in the cultural sector to give lectures in rotation to entertain listeners. In addition, the station is now selectively installing public radios in various wounded soldiers' hospitals and refugee shelters, which are greatly beneficial to the wounded soldiers and refugees. The station's broadcast program list is as follows: 7:00 Morning Exercises, 15:00 Patriotic Songs, 7:15 Military Music, 15:10 Lecture (Thursday, Shanghai Gazetteer), 7:30 News, 15:30 Patriotic Songs, 7:50 Selected Current Affairs Commentary, 15:35 News, 8:00 Inspirational Songs, 15:50 Patriotic Songs, 8:15 Military Music, 15:55 Wartime Knowledge (Municipal Health Bureau, Municipal Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps), 11:20 National Music, 19:00 Western Music, 11:30 Wartime Education (Bureau of Social Affairs), 19:10 English News (Municipal Government), 12:00 National Music, 19:30 Western Music, 12:10 News, 19:40 Western Music, 20:00 Relay Central Program, 21:05 Relay International Program, 22:00 News, 22:15 Program Preview, 22:20 Shutdown.

### Battlefield Notes

— Wang Ziying

Three Soldiers

The enemy criticizes our soldiers, saying that our soldiers clearly have modern equipment but lack a modern spirit. The example they give is that night raids are the Chinese army's forte, and the Chinese army's bravery is commendable, but they falter about 30 meters from the Imperial Army's position and are overwhelmed by the Imperial Army's strength. This is what they write extensively about, meaning that our army does not understand this war of resistance and therefore lacks the determination to sacrifice. Nonsense. Let us give him a counter-example. Let's not talk about our offense, but only about our defense, and you can see that our soldiers are all determined to coexist with the land they defend.

On the 3rd, our defending soldiers in Luzhai had such a heroic record. Luzhai is a salient point of the Shi Xiangong Temple. With this point in our hands, the enemies advancing from both sides of the highway would be greatly threatened, so they were determined to launch fierce attacks on that salient point for several days. Our defending army changed from a battalion (excluding previous casualties, in fact, not more than a hundred people) to a nominal company. Needless to say, they were all sacrificed. After the battalion commander was killed in action, the remaining company commander was left to command, and the company commander was also killed in action. Only four soldiers were left. On the 3rd, the fierce attack, with simultaneous firepower from planes and artillery, achieved this effect. However, the enemy had already suffered more than 400 casualties, and their offensive did not stop. Instead, they were collecting corpses. One of our four soldiers carried the company commander's body away, leaving only three people. They still fired fiercely and resisted bravely, resisting for more than an hour. The enemy still did not dare to approach. At this time, two companies of our reinforcements had arrived, and the enemy retreated in panic, leaving more than a hundred corpses in front of our position. At the same time, our ×× commander's defending soldiers in a certain place also had such a heroic scene. A company of defending soldiers in that place were mostly killed in battle, and the remaining ten or so people, led by a squad leader, were still resisting strongly in a stronghold. When the bullets ran out, they only had hand grenades, which exploded in the enemy's dense ranks. Suddenly, an enemy officer rushed in. The squad leader tightly gripped the company commander's pistol, a pistol with only one bullet loaded. He tried to move some of the mechanism, but there was no sound. So he quickly grabbed an iron shovel and knocked the enemy down. Then, he threw a few more hand grenades into the enemy's dense ranks. The enemy was finally subdued by our power and retreated. Afterwards, the commander ××× in that area, in addition to investigating and applying for awards, personally awarded 100 yuan to each of them. How precious is this 100 yuan that was exchanged for life! (26/10/5, 2:00 AM, Kunshan)

### Mortar Power

In the past two days, the enemy has felt particularly difficult in attacking us. They say that attacking our Shanghai defense line is even more difficult than attacking the Lushun Fortress in the past. It is said that there are two main difficulties: first, our mortars are too powerful, often exerting great power every time the enemy approaches; second, our army's night raids prevent the enemy from sleeping peacefully at night, thus reducing their daytime attack power. This is the enemy's general criticism of us. Then, a recent battle between a certain army west of Luodian and the enemy can provide a practical example.

On the night of the 3rd, the enemy in the Dingjiaqiao-Zhangjiayan area used trenches to approach us and harass Xiaopan. Our army dispatched two companies to launch a counterattack in the dark. Our army suffered more than 50 casualties, while the enemy suffered more than 400. The enemy's artillery also suffered a heavy bombardment from our artillery, unable to stand their ground and changing positions several times overnight. The next day, as if in retaliation, the enemy concentrated artillery fire on our positions and used nine planes, divided into three teams, to bomb our positions in rotation, while also searching for our artillery positions to bomb. The enemy's strength was about a regiment, moving towards our positions. Our artillery was still firing under the enemy planes' surveillance, but it was still weak. At this time, our infantry lay in the trenches, without moving a muscle. When the enemy was about to approach, our newest mortars immediately exerted their greatest power, and every shell hit the target. At the same time, our infantry also jumped out of the trenches and charged at the enemy. The enemy's ferocity was completely subdued by us, and they left another three or four hundred corpses and had to retreat again.

We now dare to tell the enemy seriously that every one of our combatants is fighting bravely for national liberation. Our hearts are united, and we are ten thousand times more solid than Lushun. At the same time, the so-called night counterattack is the forte of every one of our strong men. And what's more, we have a lot more of this newest type of mortar! (26/10/15, 0:30 AM)

### Rickshaw Pullers Willing to Purchase 100,000 in Public Bonds

To be allocated from the relief deposit, recommended to the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association

Rickshaw puller Ma Taizhi and 15 others, because of the urgency of the national crisis, were filled with righteous indignation and submitted a public petition to the Municipal Government, requesting that the Special District Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association withdraw 100,000 yuan of the relief funds deposited by the rickshaw pullers year by year and day by day to purchase national salvation public bonds. The Municipal Government approved it and issued a commendation order to the rickshaw pullers, instructing them to directly recommend it to the Special District Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association. Ma and others then submitted a letter of recommendation to the association, stating: "Since the Japanese pirates invaded Shanghai, both gods and men are outraged. Our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has advocated all-out resistance, and all of us descendants of the Yellow Emperor should contribute money and effort to the nation and the nation to save the country and resist the stubborn enemy. Although Taizhi and others are rickshaw pullers, they are poor and have no standing, but they are determined to serve the country. The Special District Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association has deposited no less than tens of thousands of yuan of relief funds from the rickshaw pullers year by year and day by day. Taizhi and others recently consulted and unanimously agreed to withdraw 100,000 yuan of the funds to purchase national salvation public bonds. The deposits are all the blood and sweat of the rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw pullers are citizens of the Republic of China and have a share in patriotism. All those with a conscience will applaud and agree. In addition to directly submitting a public petition to the Municipal Government for approval and instructing to directly recommend it to the Association, we hereby make the above recommendation, so that a decision can be made and implemented as soon as possible, which is beneficial to the public." It is also learned that the rickshaw pullers have also sent letters to directors Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Wang, requesting that they unanimously advocate it.

### Brief Report on Relief Work

The Red Swastika Society's relief team continued to depart for the front line last night in the continuous autumn rain, rescuing 36 wounded soldiers in the Jiangwan-Zhabei area and sending them to various hospitals for treatment. It is learned that the Society's Shanghai General Office has recently received reports from the Hankou, Wuhu, Xiaguan, and Nanjing Associations detailing their relief work.

The Fifth Relief Team under the Shanghai Relief Committee picked up a large burlap bag containing valuable books marked with "Jinan University" on the way to the front line for work the other day. They imagine it to be something lost by Jinan University. It has now been publicly announced that the school should prepare a formal receipt and collect it from the team at He'an Primary School on North Chengdu Road. Also, the team will be departing for a long stay in another city to handle relief work in the coming days and is in need of two bicycles. They hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will provide generous assistance and send them to He'an Primary School.

Patriotic person Wang Jinwen and others organized the Battlefield Mobile Dare-to-Die Rescue Team, dedicated to going to the front lines of battlefields across the country to carry out dare-to-die rescue work and fulfill their responsibilities. They have already submitted a request to the Central Health Department's General Administration of Rescue Professionals for filing.

The Eighth Relief Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, organized by the Yousheng Travel Group of this city, has three hospital buildings with a total capacity of over 300 wounded soldiers. Later, the council of the group, in view of the expansion of the war and the increasing tension in rescue work, decided to find ways to expand the hospital buildings to benefit the wounded soldiers. At that time, they immediately rented a house on the left side of the hospital to prepare the Fourth Hospital, which has now been arranged with 76 additional beds. It has started to accommodate wounded soldiers since yesterday.

### All-Out Resistance and Nationwide Resistance

— She Mengyao

Since the launch of the August 13th Shanghai Resistance, we have entered a period of all-out resistance. Whether in North China, Central China, South China, or anywhere in the country, the torch of resistance has been lit. Moreover, whether in military, political, diplomatic, economic, or cultural aspects, we have been responding to this all-out resistance in synchronized steps. Indeed! This resistance is the last critical moment for the survival of our nation and the foundation for the revitalization of our Chinese nation. Naturally, we need the strength of the entire nation to fight in order to accomplish this great undertaking!

The end of this all-out resistance is very distant and remote. In fact, a prolonged war of attrition is our policy. We have also prepared to endure this difficult and arduous period in order to achieve the final victory. But in this painful process, we need our firm and unwavering national will and indomitable spirit to maintain it! In other words, we need to organize a joint military-civilian resistance front to promote national strength! Struggle resolutely and unyieldingly. We know that during the European War, Germany at that time was truly arrogant and thought they were invincible. Their troops penetrated deep into the territory of Russia, France, and Belgium, thinking that they would definitely defeat the Allied Powers. However, after four years of war, they still ended in failure. What is the reason for this? The biggest reason is that the people in their country could no longer endure it, and the will to fight crumbled, leading to the depletion of resources, so they had to sign a treaty of surrender. Therefore, the factor of failure lies in the fact that the people in their country did not have the determination to endure the war and persevere for the last five minutes to win the victory (to be continued).
