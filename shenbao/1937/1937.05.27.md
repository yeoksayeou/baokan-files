### Sudden Tension in Tokyo Regarding China

Various Newspapers Make Inflammatory Propaganda, Carrying Provocative News for Days, Believing the Chinese Government Has Begun Changing Things in North China, and the Qingdao Tax Police Change of Guard Has Even Become a Pretext for Them

[Tokyo] The atmosphere here regarding China has suddenly become tense, further heightened by the issuance of extra editions by various newspapers. According to these extra editions, two Japanese fishing boats were shot at by Chinese tax police in the Bohai Sea. This kind of provocative news, coinciding with the dispatch of special commissioners from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army to China for inspection and the military officials' meeting in Tianjin, is quite noteworthy. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)

[Tokyo] The northward journey of Chinese Minister of Interior Jiang Zuobin and Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Feng Yuxiang, the return of Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council Song Zheyuan to his post, and the meeting between Vice Chairman Feng and Chairman of Shandong Han Fuqu in Tai'an have triggered extremely nervous speculation here, believing that the Chinese Central Government has practically begun changing things in North China. Meanwhile, regarding the Shandong tax police issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes there are no temporary diplomatic problems, but the military still considers this a serious issue. This morning, newspapers here have excessively exaggerated the publicity of the Shantou Japanese Consulate Police incident, especially the report of Japanese destroyers sailing to Shantou, which is most alarming. Many newspapers have used the most inflammatory language to report the above news, in order to stir up the same atmosphere as after the Hankou incident last autumn. However, the actual trend does not seem to be preparing to launch a serious situation. Previously, the government here seemed to spare no effort in exaggerating the so-called anti-Japanese sentiment in China, in order to, on the one hand, change the intense anti-government sentiment at home, and on the other hand, create reasons to request the inclusion of larger military expenditures when drafting the next fiscal year's national budget. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)

[Tokyo] Japanese newspapers point out that recent frequent Sino-Japanese conflicts within China have greatly damaged Sino-Japanese relations. They especially emphasize the development arising from the case of the Shantou police detaining a Japanese consulate police officer. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the situation in Shantou is serious. Rear Admiral Okuma has already rushed to Shantou on a flagship from Lushun, and three Japanese destroyers sailed from Xiamen to Shantou yesterday. If necessary, sailors will be sent ashore. Meanwhile, Japanese Consul-General to Guangzhou Nakamura is currently negotiating with representatives of the Guangdong government to resolve the matter. The case of a Chinese customs patrol boat firing at a Japanese fishing boat outside Dalian on May 23, injuring crew members, is also attracting much attention. Furthermore, Japanese reports of large numbers of Chinese soldiers intruding into the Qingdao area and assaulting Japanese people in Jiaozhou Bay are also making Sino-Japanese relations increasingly strained. The Kokumin Shimbun claims that Japan, in order to maintain Sino-Japanese friendship, has adopted a moderate attitude towards the Chengdu case, etc., but the recent events in Shantou have completely demonstrated China's lack of sincerity, making it impossible for Japan to seek a compromise through ordinary negotiations. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs apparently has no choice but to study a practical method to obtain a fundamental solution. The Asahi Shimbun claims that Chinese police have apparently forgotten that Japanese people in China enjoy extraterritoriality. The news of the detention of a Japanese police officer in Shantou has dimmed the prospects for progress in Sino-Japanese relations. (26th Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)

[Hong Kong] Li Hanhun returned to Shantou on the "Haili" on the 26th. Wu Tiecheng ordered Shantou Mayor Huang Bingdong to return to Shantou and negotiate with the Japanese consul, adhering to the principle of safeguarding sovereignty. (26th Special Telegram)

The Japanese Navy Commander stationed in Taiwan, Okuma, arrived in Shantou on the "Yubari" on the 26th, anchoring in the sea. There are now a total of four Japanese warships. The people of Shantou believe that the fault lies with the Japanese side, and the public is calm as usual. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)

[Guangzhou] Japanese Consul-General to Guangdong, Toyoichi Nakamura, paid visits to the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Ouyang Ju, at 11 AM and 4 PM on the 26th, and had discussions regarding the case of Japanese residents of Shantou, Aoyama Kiyoshi, etc., refusing to register their households and assaulting police officers. As a result, both sides shared the same view that the incident was minor and did not want to escalate the situation. It is heard that the competent officials from both sides intend to study a solution based on the principle of peace. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)

[Tokyo] The Japanese cabinet held a regular meeting at 11:45 AM this morning. Foreign Minister Sato reported on the progress of the Shantou incident, stating that the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China, Hidaka, and the Consul in Guangzhou, Nakamura, had already lodged protests with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Guangdong Provincial Government respectively. In addition, one Japanese cruiser and three destroyers have sailed to Shantou. It is heard that the Foreign Minister expressed his opinion that this incident can be resolved peacefully, and therefore, the cabinet members currently agreed to entrust the Foreign Minister with the handling of this incident. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)

[Nanjing] Regarding the change of guard of tax police near Qingdao and the refusal of Japanese residents in Shantou to complete household registration transfer procedures and assaulting our police officers, Japanese newspapers have been excessively publicizing these events in recent days. It is also heard that three Japanese warships have sailed towards Shantou. In order to clarify the situation, the reporter specifically inquired with the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who explained the truth of these two matters separately as follows: ㊀ The Shandong Jiao'ao salt area has always had a battalion of tax police stationed there. On the 2nd of this month, the Ministry of Finance transferred the battalion back to Haizhou and dispatched the 5th Regiment of tax police to fill the position. This move was due to the increase in salt tax in order to prevent smuggling, so one or two more battalions were added to strengthen the anti-smuggling force. However, the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao, not understanding this intention, actually protested to the Qingdao Municipal Government, demanding that the Central Government withdraw the force. At the same time, the Japanese newspapers in Qingdao fabricated the fact that the tax police were oppressing Koreans and made provocative attacks on the Shandong and Qingdao provincial and municipal governments, making one suspect that they were intentionally looking for trouble, which is truly regrettable. Chinese armed forces are free to transfer and station troops within their own territory, and there is no room for interference from outsiders. Moreover, the duty of the tax police is only to suppress smuggling, and there is really no need to panic. ㊁ A Japanese resident of Shantou City, Aoyama Kiyoshi, did not follow police regulations to apply for an entry permit and forcibly moved into the second floor of the Shenzhou Foreign Firm on Yongping Road, under the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct, on the 22nd of this month. The police officers advised him to stop, but he instead assaulted each of the police officers. The police then took the Japanese resident to the bureau and sent him to the municipal government. The municipal government released him to the Japanese consul that evening and made demands to the Japanese consul such as punishing the assailant. The above is the report received by this Ministry regarding this case up to the present time. Now, in order to clarify the detailed situation, this Ministry has recently telegraphed the Special Commissioner stationed in Guangdong, Diao Zuqian, to go to Shantou immediately to investigate everything. It is expected that this case can be resolved appropriately soon based on accurate facts. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)

[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun commented on the Shantou incident today, attributing the root cause of this incident to the anger of the local Chinese people towards smuggling, especially that conducted by Koreans. Regarding the cause of the current incident, the newspaper first stated that there are still several points that are not very clear. If the reports transmitted here from Shantou, Guangzhou, and Shanghai are correct, that is, the insult to the Japanese police officer Aoyama is accurate, then the Chinese side has clearly neglected the fact that Japanese people in China enjoy consular jurisdiction, and this direct action against Japanese people is the most serious violation of treaty rights. However, there is one point that needs our research, that is, the smuggling constantly carried out by Koreans in Shantou may seriously misuse our rights of consular jurisdiction. The current incident, that is, the Chinese police entering a Japanese company and insulting the Japanese police officer Aoyama, is indeed an illegal action by the Chinese side. But is there no such fact there, such as Koreans' smuggling causing unnecessary irritation to the Chinese people in peacetime? Furthermore, as a result, does it not cause the Chinese people to harbor resentment against the Japanese police, whose duty is to protect Japanese residents? Therefore, in handling the current incident, in addition to expressing a strong attitude, we should study its root cause. In other words, we should review the above-mentioned general atmosphere regarding the current incident and formulate fundamental countermeasures. In conclusion, the newspaper faithfully advises the Japanese government to conduct a reasonable solution to the urgent issue of smuggling, and believes that the prerequisite for solving this problem is the reduction of Chinese tax rates. Finally, the newspaper hopes that the clarification of this issue can greatly improve Sino-Japanese relations. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)

### Tianjin Customs Denies Patrol Boat Interception of Japanese Fishing Boats

Japanese Side Claims Two Fishing Boats Were Chased, Captain of "Choshu Maru" Was Injured by Stray Bullet

[Tianjin] The Tianjin Customs denied the Japanese claim that customs patrol boats intercepted Japanese fishing boats No. 1 Choshu Maru and No. 7 Shima户Maru 18 nautical miles outside Tanggu and that the captain of Choshu Maru, Takasaki, was injured in his left arm. The spokesperson stated that the Customs did not send two patrol boats to cruise outside Tanggu on the 23rd or encounter and intercept Japanese fishing boats. The Japanese side claimed that the fishing boat No. 1 Choshu Maru, weighing 43 tons, and No. 7 Shima户Maru, weighing 49 tons, both owned by Taro Noguchi of Jippu County, encountered two customs patrol boats at 2 PM on the 23rd, 18 nautical miles east of the Tanggu lighthouse. The two boats turned around and fled, and the customs patrol boats chased and fired shots. The Choshu Maru fell behind and was hit by more than a dozen bullets in the stern. The captain, Takasaki, was injured in his left arm by a stray bullet at this time. Because the boat stopped, the patrol boats approached, searched it, and then the boat and the Shima户Maru sailed back to Dalian and reported to their government. The Customs has not received any report regarding this incident from the 23rd to the present. (26th Special Telegram)

[Tianjin] Two gunboats of the Japanese Kwantung State Fisheries Association sailed out of Dalian on the 26th and cruised in the Bohai Bay and the sea off Tanggu, saying that in view of the Choshu Maru incident, they were specially protecting fishing boats. (26th Special Telegram)

### Japanese Ronin Forcibly Occupy Tianjin Xiaoximen Branch Card

Kidnapping Inspectors and Police Chiefs, Seizing Swords and Guns and Refusing to Return Them, We Protested but Received No Reply

[Nanjing] According to news from Tianjin, around midnight on the 12th of this month, about 40 to 50 Japanese ronin, armed with weapons, mostly knives and sticks, forcibly occupied the Tianjin Customs Xiaoximen branch card. They imprisoned two customs officers at the branch card and the police chief and police officers sent by the Public Security Bureau, not allowing them freedom of movement. When they were about to leave, they kidnapped Wu Hongqing, the investigator of the branch card, and the police chief of the Anti-Public Security Bureau and confiscated two rifles and a small knife from the police team. After receiving the report, the Tianjin Customs immediately sent the acting deputy inspector, a Japanese named Isa Ushinokuke, accompanied by several customs officers to inspect the branch card. When the deputy inspector arrived at the branch card, the Japanese ronin had already taken the detained customs officers away from the branch card to the Japanese Concession. Afterwards, the deputy inspector went to the Japanese Concession to find the detained personnel. It was later found out that the investigator and the police chief were hidden in the Japanese company Yitai Foreign Firm. After some negotiation, the two people were released from the foreign firm, but the rifles and small knife that had been confiscated were not returned. According to the deputy inspector, the Japanese ronin stated that the weapons must be returned by the Japanese military authorities or the Japanese Consulate General. It was also reported that when the Japanese ronin occupied the branch card, ten trucks, loaded with smuggled goods, took the opportunity to break through the card and go inland. After this case occurred, it is heard that the authorities protested to the Japanese Consul General stationed in Tianjin, demanding that the troublemaking ronin be severely punished and the weapons returned. The Japanese Consul General has not yet replied. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)

(Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[Nanjing] The remedial measures for civil service qualification examination in various provinces and cities, proposed by the Examination Yuan, were passed by the Central Political Council on the morning of the 26th. The original text of the measures is as follows: ㊀ All civil servants in national agencies, except foreigners serving in central agencies, shall uniformly undergo supplementary screening registration. ㊁ Incumbent civil servants who took office before December 1936 and have not been granted qualifications shall be permitted to undergo supplementary screening in accordance with the Regulations for Screening and Review of Incumbent Civil Servants. Civil servants who took office before the end of December 1936 and have already retired without having been granted qualifications shall be permitted to undergo supplementary registration in accordance with the Civil Servant Registration Regulations. ㊂ For civil servants who retired due to agency downsizing, their applications for registration shall be submitted by the incumbent head of the original agency's superior agency for review, and shall not be reviewed and forwarded by the original agency head individually. ㊃ The deadline for supplementary screening and registration shall be six months, starting from the date of approval and promulgation of this measure. If necessary, it may be extended once, still limited to six months. ㊄ After this supplementary screening registration of civil servants, all provinces and cities shall strictly enforce the deadlines for submission for approval of civil servant appointments and the methods for disbursing salaries, and shall not request remedies on any grounds. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[Nanjing] On the 26th, Ms. Chen Bijun, a member of the Central Committee, proposed to the Central Political Council that the Ministry of Education be instructed to promptly formulate standardized hats for female students at all levels of schools and to universally order their wearing. The proposal has been passed to the Executive Yuan. The original text of the proposal is recorded as follows: On the matter of proposal, clothing is for covering the body, hats are for covering the head; the two are equally important, regardless of gender. In ancient China, women had hats, as can be seen in the classics, clearly documented. Later, seclusion became the custom. However, rural women, due to their labor, such as engaging in farming and mulberry cultivation, and even undertaking carrying tasks, invariably wore bamboo hats, or added cloth brims under the hats, to shield from the wind in winter and from the sun in summer, greatly benefiting the maintenance of physical health. As for urban women, due to living secluded lives, they felt there was no need to wear hats. In recent decades, the custom of female seclusion has gradually faded, but considering that European and American women's hat-making always complements their facial features, with styles varying from person to person, people are both daunted by the difficulty and fear opening up extravagant habits. Therefore, the wearing of hats by women has not yet become common. Because of this, they are exposed to wind in winter and heat in summer, damaging their health and harming their bodies, truly a case of penny-wise, pound-foolish. Observe the male and female students in winter and summer, when attending ceremonies, gathering in squares, or parading in streets. Female students often have the appearance of lowering their heads and furrowing their brows. It is not that their physique is weaker than that of male students, but simply because their heads are not covered, exposed to fierce winds in winter and scorching sun in summer, leading to this appearance. As for illnesses resulting from this, who but their relatives would know? Recently, due to the organization of Boy Scouts and the implementation of military training, female students participating all wear standardized hats and benefit greatly from them. However, outside of Boy Scouts and military training, there are no standardized hats to wear, which intensifies their feelings of inconvenience. For the sake of female students nationwide, it is appropriate for the Ministry of Education to promptly formulate standardized hats for female students at all levels and universally order their wearing. The styles may be simple, the materials must be domestic goods, and the primary purpose should be to shield from wind and sun. Once female students universally wear them, their impact on all women will be profound and far-reaching. If this becomes widespread among the people, the benefits to the cultivation of physique and the improvement of health will be immense. This proposal is respectfully submitted for public decision. Committee Member Chen Bijun. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

This reporter revisited Chu in the afternoon to discuss the tour. Chu first stated that the tour group initiated by President Chiang departed from Nanjing on the 5th of last month, passing through eight provinces, a total of over 11,000 li, taking 52 days, and completing its mission today. During this time, all members did not hesitate to travel, and were able to fulfill their tour missions. Along the way, they received warm receptions, welcomes, and assistance from the local governments and people of various provinces, which made the tour a smooth success. He was extremely grateful and pleased. This trip passed through the counties, cities, and towns of six provinces, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi. Everywhere they went, the enthusiastically welcoming people and the trained and organized strong men cheered on the streets, often numbering in the tens of thousands, demonstrating the people's love for the central government and the popularization of national consciousness among the people, which was inspiring. The group also took this opportunity to give various speeches, conveying the central government's intentions, which greatly moved the audience. Secondly, the consistent efforts of the governments and people of various provinces to advance various new construction projects towards a bright future are even more gratifying. However, due to the limited itinerary, they only stopped for two or three days in places like Nanchang, Changsha, Guiyang, and Guilin. In Kunming, they stayed for eight days due to Chairman Long's retention. Although the time was short, the group directly and indirectly obtained a considerable amount of material. He plans to request the Executive Yuan to form an editorial committee, composed of the group's leaders, deputy leaders, group leaders, general secretaries, deputy secretaries, and reporters from various newspapers participating in the tour, to compile materials from various departments and prepare a general report, accompanied by photographs, for reference by the central government and the people of the country. The local specialties and photographs obtained will be used to hold an exhibition in the future, so that the people of Nanjing can observe and appreciate them. Finally, the reporter inquired about the situation in each province separately. Chu stated that the people in the Jiao Xuan area of Anhui Province are active and agile. Jiangxi Province, after the banditry, is striving for construction and full of emerging atmosphere. Hunan Province is inherently a rich area, with simple folk customs, and the people are especially able to endure hardship and work hard. Although Yunnan is far away on the border, it is not different in spirit from the recent provinces, and the local villages are settled. Guangxi Province is united from top to bottom, there are no beggars in the whole province, and the people are able to live and work in peace. Both Yunnan and Guangxi provinces are rich in copper and tin and other products, and export a lot every year. In addition, the people are thrifty and consume very little, so they are the only provinces in the country that have trade surpluses. However, Guizhou Province is not affluent, and after the banditry two years ago, it was followed by a five-month drought this year, so the disaster situation is severe. The province originally had a saying, "No three days of sunshine in the sky, no three feet of flat land, no three taels of silver for the people." Even without disasters, people's lives are already very difficult. Now, in the face of a major disaster, relief cannot be delayed. Fortunately, when the group arrived in Guizhou, heavy clouds suddenly appeared from east to west (usually in Guizhou Province, it rains a lot, and clouds always move from west to east), and then there was timely rain, so agriculture could be slightly revived, and the people were happy. The reporter laughed and said that the clouds were escorting the tour group westward, no wonder the people of Guizhou Province felt that the spiritual rain had saved the people. The reporter then took leave of Chu. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[Chongqing] The tour group has been visiting various scenic spots for days. The local press gave a farewell banquet for the group this afternoon.

Current Commentary

### The Desirable Approach to Resolving the Far Eastern Question

For several weeks, the Far Eastern question has shown a tendency towards rapid change due to the British Imperial Conference, the concretization of Anglo-Japanese negotiations, and the travels of our country's special envoy, Kong Xiangxi, between London and Geneva. Furthermore, Australian Prime Minister Lyons' proposal for a Pacific regional security agreement at the Imperial Conference has become the focus of international attention. Although the current situation has not yet reached the point of convening a Pacific conference to seek a comprehensive resolution to the Far Eastern question, it is now a more hopeful time since the September 18th Incident. Of course, if Japan goes astray and does not know how to return, if the United States continues to adopt a hands-off approach, if Britain harbors thoughts of temporary ease, and if China is still unable to unite internally, the possibility of such a resolution is extremely slim. Assuming that the time is gradually ripening, we must have a common understanding and belief regarding the approach to be taken for a comprehensive resolution of the Far Eastern question.

This approach should include three points: First, the methods of monopolizing or partitioning China are absolutely useless. Equal opportunity and the open door, under the principles and realities of China's sovereign independence and territorial integrity, are permissible. Second, recognizing that a strong and prosperous China is the best guarantee of peace in the Far East, all issues must be premised on China's interests. All existing conditions detrimental to China must be broken. Third, a permanent and practical solution should be sought, rather than a superficial and temporary one. Collective peace must be supported by international forces and cannot rely solely on the signatures of various countries. A treaty without real strength as a backdrop, no matter how perfect, will always end up as waste paper in the hands of militarists.

Regarding the first point, some people who have discussed the Far Eastern question in the past have advocated monopolizing China, such as the East Asian Monroe Doctrine proposed by Japan, especially the various propositions included in the 1934 Amau Doctrine. Some have advocated partitioning China, such as the so-called recognition of a certain country's special interests in a certain region before the Washington Conference, and the recent division of spheres of influence advocated by Japanese newspapers, "Japan in North China and Britain in Central and South China." The British government has formally denied this, as Foreign Secretary Eden recently stated to Kong Xiangxi that Anglo-Japanese negotiations would never harm China's interests. Apart from monopolization and partitioning, there is the joint development of China by the great powers. This approach can be accepted under the conditions that China has a strong central government and independent capabilities. Premier Sun already had a plan to use foreign capital to develop China, and the current government has repeatedly stated that it welcomes cooperation with all countries in the world. Special Envoy Kong's work in London roughly focused on obtaining the joint cooperation of various countries in the financial and economic fields. In the political field, we should welcome countries along the Pacific to jointly negotiate and build a Pacific collective security system, and China is certainly willing to bear the greatest responsibility and obligation for maintaining order in the Far East.

Second, China is the core of the Far Eastern question, and China's strength is the greatest guarantee of peace in the Far East. Therefore, any issue should be considered with the freedom, equality, revival, and self-strengthening of the Chinese nation as the standard. We cannot take maintaining the status quo as a solution, nor can we recognize any fait accompli. When the Washington Treaty was signed in 1922, all countries had already realized this. Therefore, no country was allowed to take advantage of China's weakness at the time to hinder China's nation-building efforts. Now that China has a unified and strong government, and political and social order has been stabilized, lasting peace in the Far East has already shown a glimmer of hope due to China's unification. The strengthening of this glimmer depends on the Chinese nation being freed from its current shackles. From China's perspective, it should be recognized that Heaven helps those who help themselves and strive for self-improvement. From the perspective of the great powers related to the Far East, they should also recognize that this great nation cannot be permanently subjected to inequality and aggression. The recovery of lost territories and the abolition of unequal treaties are China's reasonable demands and the prerequisites for peace.

Finally, all solutions must have real strength to maintain them and cannot completely rely on the credibility and goodwill of any country. The Washington Nine-Power Treaty became a waste of paper because there was no power of sanctions. Although there were provisions for mutual consultation in the Four-Power Treaty, there was no real organization to deal with problems that arise at any time. Therefore, to seek a thorough resolution to the Far Eastern question, there must not only be a collective security system but also an organized and powerful collective security system. Without steps and power to sanction aggression, security is a tower in the sand. What China demands is not only security, but also security built on justice.

### Paris-Tokyo Flight Fails, French Plane Crashes in Kochi Prefecture

Two Aviators Injured, Fuselage Destroyed, Adversity All the Way Since Continuing Flight from Shanghai

⊙Kochi: An airplane wreckage was discovered near Tohara Beach, Muroki Village, Agawa District, Kochi Prefecture, appearing to be a Duralumin aircraft; currently under investigation.

Another dispatch at 8:25 PM: The Duralumin aircraft landed at Hinohara Beach, Muroki Village, Agawa District, Kochi Prefecture at 7:30 PM this afternoon. The two occupants sustained minor injuries and have been admitted to Oishi Hospital in the village, where they are undergoing surgery. Yet another dispatch at 10:25 PM: The Duralumin aircraft that overturned at Tohara Beach, two miles south of Kochi, has suffered extensive damage to its fuselage. The right wing has nearly separated from the engine, while the left wing remains intact, battered by the waves. Villagers are maintaining watch throughout the night. Yet another dispatch at 10:45 PM: Mr. Dural is bandaged on his face, while Mr. Michele-Dit has a minor forehead injury. Despite their serious injuries, these aerial heroes are drinking and smoking, conversing animatedly, saying, "Since taking off from Shanghai at 1:30 PM today, we have been in constant distress, flying westward from the homeland to the east, then turning back westward. This time, when we tried to head east again, we saw a sandy beach and decided to land. Although we have overcome numerous difficulties to reach this point, it is regrettable that our goal has not been achieved." He could not help but burst into tears as he spoke.

Yet another dispatch at 11:40 PM: Mr. Dural and Mr. Michele-Dit were transported to the Japanese Red Cross Hospital in Kochi City by car at 10 PM this evening and are receiving formal treatment. Although both remain in good spirits, Mr. Dural's injuries will require ten days to fully recover, while Mr. Michele-Dit will also require a week of recuperation. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)

[Paris] French aviators Dural and Michele-Dit, flying from Paris to Tokyo, attempted to complete the entire journey in 100 hours to set a new record and claim the government's 400,000-franc prize. Unfortunately, near the Taiwan Strait, due to adverse weather conditions, they were forced to turn back to Guangzhou Bay, scheduled to take off again on the morning of the 26th. They had to reach Tokyo before 9:05 AM on the 26th to stay within the limit, but this was impossible. Therefore, Mr. Dural and Mr. Michele-Dit's plan has been declared a failure. (National Maritime News Agency dispatch dated the 25th)

[Tokyo] After receiving news of Mr. Dural's plane arriving in Shanghai, the French Embassy believed that the ambition of "Aviation France" could reach far this time, and the situation was very tense. Ambassador Henri and all the embassy staff went to Haneda Airport to wait. The Imperial Aviation Association also began various welcome preparations. However, after checking, the Dural plane had been in the air for 93 hours and 54 minutes from its departure from Paris to noon on the 26th. Therefore, it could not reach the 100-hour record unless it flew to Haneda before 6:06 PM (Tokyo time) on the 26th. The remaining distance between Shanghai and Tokyo is 1,770 kilometers. According to the performance of the "Caudron Simon" aircraft, the fastest time required is seven and a half hours. Therefore, whether it can win the championship is of great concern. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)

### Situation of Passing Shanghai Yesterday Morning

(Local News) French aviators Dural and Michele-Dit arrived in Shanghai at 10:05 AM yesterday morning, rested for an hour, and continued their flight. Unexpectedly, the tire was damaged, causing another delay, and they only managed to take off at 12:35 PM. If there were no problems along the way, they could reach their destination before 5:30 PM. Mr. Dural and Mr. Michele-Dit could have passed Shanghai yesterday, but they were delayed for about ten hours near Fort Bayard in Guangzhou Bay due to a mechanical obstruction. They only managed to repair the aircraft and the coastal weather had also improved. They took off at 2:00 AM yesterday morning, and arrived in Shanghai at 10:05 AM without any obstacles along the way. They landed safely at Longhua Airport amidst the enthusiastic welcome of fifty or so French and Chinese officials and civilians. The aircraft driven by the two men was a "Caudron" Simon monoplane, silver-white all over, painted with red characters, and the wings and tail were also painted with red stripes. The nose of the plane was very long, and the cockpit was in the front, accommodating only two people, with a storage compartment in the back. The two aviators were dressed in blue flight suits, looking energetic. After getting off the plane, they shook hands with French Consul-General Patard, French Municipal Council Director-General Weizhi Cheng, Police Commissioner Fabre, and others who came to welcome them, and after briefly having drinks and snacks, they inspected the aircraft and added fuel and oil in preparation for the continuation of their flight. Although there were still dark clouds in the city yesterday morning, and it was alternately sunny and rainy, according to a telegram from Tokyo, the coastal weather had improved, and it was estimated that the journey from Shanghai to Tokyo would take about five hours. Therefore, they started the engine at 11:15 AM and continued their flight. Unexpectedly, after circling the airport half a time, the tire deflated, causing a tire to sink into the ground, and stopped at the eastern end of the airport. French expatriates and Chinese and Eurasian company mechanics at the airport helped to repair it. For a while, the airport was filled with the tense movement of cars, because if it could not be repaired within an hour, the effort would be wasted. After replacing the old tire, the flight took off at 13:35, delaying about an hour. It must reach Tokyo before 6:00 PM to create this difficult and dangerous new record. However, last night, the French consulate received news that it did not arrive in Kagoshima until about 8:30 PM in the evening, so the two men were ultimately unable to achieve their wishes. However, this was entirely due to bad weather and repeated setbacks, and their spirit is especially worthy of praise.

### Japan Strengthens Economic Front Against China

Ministry of Foreign Affairs Convened a Meeting of Bankers, Focusing Discussions on Clearing Old Debts

[Tokyo] Officials of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and bankers involved in investments in China held a meeting at 3:00 PM today. The attendees included Hioki, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Uemura, Chief of the First Section of the East Asia Bureau, Kanohara, Director of the Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Umeura, Chief of the National Finance Section of the Finance Bureau (representing the government), Kawakami, Vice President of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Kamada, Chief of the Economics Section, Komori, Vice President of the Bank of Korea, Yamamoto, Director of the Bank of Taiwan, Yoshihara, Chief of the Reorganization Section, Yamahira, General Manager of the First Bank, Noda, Manager of the Tokyo Branch of Sumitomo Bank (representing the banking sector). It is reported that the representatives exchanged opinions, focusing on the issue of clearing old debts. No specific plans were agreed upon regarding the issue of issuing new loans to China. However, since the Japanese government is determined to promote the so-called economic cooperation with China, it has planned to establish appropriate agencies in the ports of the Yangtze River basin, and has acquired private banks in Shanghai and Hankou, sending economic envoys to China, establishing an economic and commercial section in the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy in China, and establishing a China Economic Research Section in the Research Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Due to the above-mentioned activities, today's meeting can be regarded, at a minimum, as a liaison for various preparations to strengthen Japan's economic front against China. (Central News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)

[Tokyo] Although the Japanese government is very willing to compete with Britain, the United States, and Germany for loans to China, it has encountered the serious problem of mobilizing domestic surplus funds, because the surplus funds have been exhausted by the expansion of the military industry. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited representatives of the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, the Bank of Taiwan, Sumitomo, and the First Bank, which are related to investment in China, to hold a meeting today to explore their opinions on loans to China. Although some aspects expressed optimism about this, financial circles revealed that today's discussions still focused on dealing with various old debts to China, hoping that the Chinese government would repay the old debts as newly recognized debts. However, some credit loan issues were also discussed. (Reuters dispatch dated the 26th from Central News Agency)

### Amau Leaves Japan for China

### Mussolini Says Italy Needs Peace

Believes Abolishing Armaments Is Not Yet the Time, Responds to Hull's Remarks to the United States

[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met today with Sims, a diplomatic reporter from the Howard newspaper group in the United States, saying that if President Roosevelt convenes an international disarmament conference, Italy will wholeheartedly support it, and all countries in the world will participate. The current arms race will be difficult to sustain, and if it is not stopped soon, the whole world will fall into economic bankruptcy. Italy also needs peace in order to develop its existing resources. "I do not advocate abolishing armaments, but advocate limiting armaments, because abolishing armaments is not yet the time, but limiting armaments can be implemented."

### League of Nations Assembly Opens

Turkish Representative Elected as Chairman, Egypt's Accession Likely to Be Approved, Albania Excluded from the Meeting

[Geneva] The League of Nations Temporary Assembly opened at 11:00 AM today, chaired by the Chairman of the Administrative Council, also the representative of Ecuador, Dr. Geoffroy. (Note: The new League of Nations building has been completed, and the League of Nations Assembly is holding its meeting at the old site, which is the last time.) He gave a speech saying that the reason for convening the Temporary Assembly was because Egypt requested to join the League of Nations as a member state, and he was honored to be appointed as chairman. The vitality of the League of Nations has been further demonstrated. The government of Ecuador will remain loyal to the League of Nations as always. Polish representative Komarnicki spoke, mentioning the fact that the Emperor of Abyssinia did not send a delegation, saying that from the perspective of the Polish government, this issue had been resolved before the General Assembly held its regular meeting in September. The representative of Mexico said that the Mexican government opposed any member state wanting to expel its membership. No other representatives requested to speak. The Temporary Assembly then elected a chairman, Turkish representative, the country's Foreign Minister Rushdi, who won 46 votes out of 49 and was elected. After taking office as chairman, Rushdi also gave a speech expressing his gratitude. The Assembly then organized a committee to discuss Egypt's accession to the League of Nations, which is expected to be approved, and the Assembly will also approve Egypt as a member state this afternoon. (Havas dispatch dated the 26th from Central News Agency)

[Geneva] The Emperor of Abyssinia recently sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, stating that after consulting with the ministers of his cabinet, he has now decided not to send a delegation to the League of Nations Temporary Assembly. The Emperor congratulated Egypt on its imminent accession to the League of Nations, and said that Abyssinia and Egypt have maintained the closest relationship for hundreds of years. The last paragraph of the Emperor's note stated that "Although Abyssinia has suffered terrible misfortunes, as a member state of the League of Nations, it still hopes that the League of Nations will eventually liberate Abyssinia's territory so that it will no longer be occupied by foreign countries. As for myself, I am ready to cooperate with the League of Nations at any time in order to establish international peace and justice. When Italy forcefully invaded Abyssinia, the League of Nations attempted to implement collective sanctions, but failed to carry them through to the end. One wrong step not only completely abandoned the people of Abyssinia, making them prey to the invaders, but also disintegrated the interior of Europe, and Spain was subjected to invasion. The consequences are such." This note was sent from Bath, England, signed by Emperor Selassie I and countersigned by the Abyssinian Foreign Minister Heruy. (Havas dispatch dated the 25th from Central News Agency)

### League of Nations Administrative Council Open Meeting

Passed Multiple Reports

[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting this afternoon, which lasted a very short time before adjourning. At the meeting, the Administrative Council expressed its condolences for the recent death of former British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, with speeches by the Chairman of Ecuador, Mr. Geoffroy, and the French representative, Foreign Minister Daladier, praising Chamberlain's contributions to European peace.

The New Zealand navy will also expand at the same time. The correspondent said that the dominion representatives are quite concerned about the security of the imperial sea lanes, especially in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, because various countries have expanded their navies. However, naval circles believe that after the rearmament plan is implemented, the security of the sea lanes will not need to be worried about. (National Maritime News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)

### The British Plan to Mediate the Spanish Civil War Fails

Withdrawal of Volunteers in Spain Faces Many Difficulties

[Geneva] The Spanish delegation attending the League of Nations today told a Reuters reporter that it intends to vigorously support the British representative's proposal to withdraw volunteers from Spain, and that there can be no ceasefire or reconciliation until the proposal is generally agreed upon in principle. If a temporary ceasefire is necessary in the future for the withdrawal of volunteers, it can be discussed at length. The only proposal that the Spanish delegation can accept today is the withdrawal of volunteers. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 25th)

[London] The sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War recently appointed a committee of experts to study the implementation of the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries in Spain. The committee of experts has now submitted a report, which has been sent by the delegations of various countries to their respective governments for review. It is generally believed that it will take at least two or three months for the withdrawal plan to be implemented, and the cost will be more than £1.1 million. Moreover, the matter must be accepted by the belligerent parties in the Spanish Civil War and the international committee must handle the withdrawal within their respective jurisdictions. The tasks of this committee are to investigate the method of withdrawal and to monitor the implementation of the withdrawal plan. As for the method of withdrawal, it roughly involves transferring foreign volunteers from the front lines to the rear in batches, and replacing them with Spanish troops. Volunteers from various countries should be concentrated in designated locations and then sent to various ports to return to their home countries by ship. However, this method faces many difficulties in practice. The most prominent of these are: first, the volunteers on both sides of the civil war must withdraw simultaneously; second, the number of volunteers withdrawn on both sides must be roughly equal; and third, all volunteers from various countries who are essential for offensive and defensive operations on the front lines must also be withdrawn. Regarding this point, the Nationalist forces need many foreign volunteers in their offensive against Bilbao and its surrounding areas in the Basque Country, while the government forces rely on the assistance of foreign volunteers to consolidate their defenses in the Madrid area. Both of these situations make withdrawal difficult. The British government is well aware of the many obstacles to withdrawing volunteers from the front lines of both sides, and therefore suggested that the two sides in the civil war temporarily cease hostilities. However, regarding this proposal, the countries concerned have not yet fully responded, but it can already be considered a failure. Therefore, the current issue lies in what attitude the countries concerned and the belligerent parties in the Spanish Civil War will adopt towards the report submitted by the committee of experts.

### Soviet Union Celebrates Arctic Flight Nationwide

Three More Planes Arrive at North Pole Station; Public Opinion in All Countries Unanimously Praises It

[Moscow] The entire population of the Soviet Union is paying attention to the progress of Arctic explorers. People from all walks of life throughout the country are holding meetings to celebrate and sending congratulatory telegrams. (TASS dispatch, 25th)

[Moscow] According to local reports, the Arctic explorers Shmidt, Vodopyanov, Papanin, and others sent a telegram of thanks to Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, and other party and government leaders, stating, "We are deeply gratified and honored to hear the congratulatory telegrams from the Party and the government. This is the glory of all the Soviet people, who have this amazing country, excellent aircraft, and unprecedented conditions for promoting scientific development and the progress of the people. You call the establishment of the Arctic station 'the culmination of a glorious period of work'. This is the period of Soviet exploration and overcoming the Arctic Ocean. This is the period when Comrade Stalin personally put forward the task of overcoming the North, personally formulated plans and methods, and personally continuously guided and cared for Arctic explorers. It is the most pleasant and honorable thing for us to realize your ideals in our own field of work and receive your praise." (TASS dispatch, 25th)

[Moscow] Three planes from Rudolph Island, loaded with food, took off in the snow, preparing to fly blindly to the Arctic. At 6:40 this morning, a radio message was received from the Arctic team stating that all three planes had safely reached their destination, less than fifteen miles from the North Pole. The first plane was piloted by Molokov, carrying seven people, including a reporter from Pravda. The second plane was piloted by Achinkevich, also carrying seven people, including a reporter from Izvestia. The third plane was piloted by Matchak, carrying six passengers. The three planes carried a total of nine tons of food and equipment. The flight from Rudolph Island to the North Pole took two hours. (Kuo Min dispatch, 25th)

[Moscow] At 11:15 PM on May 25th, the remaining three planes of the Arctic expedition took off from Rudolph Island for the Arctic floating station, carrying important supplies for the station, such as scientific instruments, food, equipment, fuel, motorcycles, and tents. (TASS dispatch, 26th)

[Moscow] At 6:24 this morning, aviator Molokov safely landed at the "North Pole Station." The other two planes took off later, and were still circling in the air at 7:40. (TASS dispatch, 26th)

[Moscow] The deputy leader of the expedition, Shevelev, who is currently on Rudolph Island, told a TASS reporter, "We will probably have to fly above the clouds to the North Pole. If that is the case, the pilots will only be able to use astronomical instruments and the radio beacon of Rudolph Island to determine direction. It would be best if the weather is clear when we approach the North Pole; otherwise, we will pass through the clouds and fly low around the Pole to find Vodopyanov's plane. If the weather turns bad when we approach the North Pole, we will choose a suitable location to land, and then try to communicate with Shmidt. Eventually, all four planes will converge at one location. After finding the best location to establish the polar station, everyone will assist Papanin's team in setting up the station. After that, we will return to Rudolph Island together." (TASS dispatch, 25th)

[Moscow] Aviator Golovin safely arrived at Rudolph Island on April 19th. The island is the northernmost island in the Soviet Arctic Ocean. Golovin flew across the Arctic Ocean for about 4,000 kilometers, from Moscow via Kolmogory, Naryan-Mar, Matochkin Strait, Cape Zhelaniya, and to the island. The flight time was 23 hours, and the entire journey took 29 days. Due to bad weather, he had to land in Kolmogory, Naryan-Mar, and Cape Zhelaniya. He was flying an ordinary twin-engine plane. Apart from a heating tank and a large oil stove for heating the engine, there was no special equipment for navigating the Arctic Ocean. Currently, Golovin is preparing to fly near the island. Rudolph Island was discovered in 1874 and is one of the northernmost territories of the Soviet Union. The island is located at 82 degrees north latitude, with an area of 220 square kilometers. The entire island is covered in ice all year round, with only a slightly thinner layer of ice on the coast. The central ice mountain is up to 300 meters high, and the flat areas are very suitable natural airfields. The island has an unusual climate. July is the warmest month, with temperatures rising to 0 degrees Celsius. November is the coldest, with temperatures mostly below minus 22 degrees Celsius. The coldest period was in 1932-33, reaching minus 36.5 degrees Celsius. The hottest period was in June 1933, reaching 6.7 degrees Celsius. In 1929, the expedition led by Shmidt established a geographical observation station in Tiksi Bay. In 1932, the world's northernmost meteorological station was established on the island. In 1936, the famous explorer Papanin established the world's northernmost winter camp there. Rudolph Island is very important because it is only 900 kilometers from the North Pole. The daily radio weather reports from the island to Moscow are extremely valuable. (TASS report)

[Moscow] Newspapers around the world continue to comment on the Soviet conquest of the Arctic. The British Manchester Guardian stated, "The Soviet Arctic exploration is not only about setting records, but also about increasing human knowledge. This exploration proves the strength of Soviet scientific progress. Soviet science has established the foundation for the great work of studying the Arctic." Finnish newspapers recorded the glorious victory of the Soviet Arctic Ocean explorers. The Social Democratic newspaper of Finland detailed the preparations for this exploration, as well as its equipment and supplies. The newspaper also prominently published the news of the Arctic exploration with large headlines. (TASS dispatch, 25th)

### Britain Plans to Conclude Trade Agreements with Various Countries

But Must Be Based on a Sound Foundation; Preferential Tariff System Not to Be Abandoned; British Trade Secretary Runciman States in the House of Commons

[London] Trade Secretary Runciman made a speech in the House of Commons today, declaring that trade negotiations between Britain and the United States are still in the preliminary stages, and that the current effort is to lay the foundation for negotiations. The British government is now awaiting the results of the Imperial Conference. Based on the resolutions of the conference, the British government will revise its commercial relations with various countries (including the United States). However, the British government has now decided to conclude a commercial treaty with the United States, and will do its best to achieve this, no matter how difficult. He continued that the Imperial Conference cannot abolish the preferential tariff system, but can only change the form of the current system. The conference is currently studying the world economic situation and will not ignore the fact that there can be many different ways of implementing the preferential tariff system. If tariffs are excessively focused on revenue collection, then this system is no different from madness. On the other hand, if no tariffs are collected at all, then neither England nor the Empire can survive. (Kuo Min Hai Tung dispatch, 25th)

### A Tour of the Political Exposition in Tokyo, Japan

Full of Historical Materials of China's National Humiliation; Sixty Years of Tragic Deeds

Tokyo Correspondence: The Tokyo Political Exposition is divided into eleven pavilions displaying valuable materials. The reporter recently visited it once, but the records at the time did not allow for detailed study. Now, after focusing on the materials related to China during my first visit, I will report what I learned below.

Constitution Pavilion

There are many heartbreaking materials related to our country displayed: ㊀ Minister Oshima, picture of negotiations between Qing and Korea, after the Sino-Japanese War, Russia, Germany, and France intervened. Ito, Kawayama, and Lt. Generals Kawakami explained the situation. ㊁ The intervention of the three countries, the original telegram from Minister Kurino Shinichiro stationed in the United States to Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu. ㊂ Pictures of the Sino-Japanese War, divided into ten pictures of Jiuliancheng, Weihaiwei, the Battle of Gyeongseong, Phoenix City, the Battle of Pyongyang, Minister Oshima's negotiations, the occupation of Asan, Jinzhou, Haiyang Island, and the Battle of Fengdao Sea, all of which are five-color paintings. ㊃ Picture of the fall of Weihaiwei. There is another eye-catching place hanging up, depicting the surrender of Ding Ruchang, admiral of the Beiyang Fleet. When Ding bowed deeply to the Japanese commander with both hands, the Japanese commander made a mocking gesture, and the guards held their guns to protect him, which made people furious. ㊄ Old map of Changhua City, Taiwan ㊅ Picture of the victory of the Russo-Japanese War in Lushunkou, China.

Diplomacy Pavilion

㊀ Photo of Li Hongzhang. ㊁ Photos of Li Hongzhang's bedroom and reception room. ㊂ Photos of the negotiation venue. ㊃ Poem and notes written by Minister Lidao, who handled matters in the seventh year of Meiji, when he returned to the imperial court after successfully negotiating and making peace with China. ㊄ Photos of the Boxer Rebellion. ㊅ Urgent book on the situation in East Asia after the Sino-Japanese War. ㊆ Book on Sino-Japanese friendship and its cause. ㊇ Agreement on Sino-Japanese friendship and its cause. ㊈ Records of Qing, Korean, and Japanese diplomatic incidents.

Army Pavilion

Items related to Sino-Japanese relations are displayed: ㊀ Sino-Japanese War, Prince Kan'in's military hat and military uniform pants, which are red, Qing dragon sword, military sword, Qing soldier company, spear. ㊁ Battle of Pyongyang, Qing soldiers' military uniforms, completely red clothes and trousers. On the back of the clothes, there is a cloth badge, which reads "Shandong Fubiao Ji Zi Right Battalion Sentinel Shed." There are black Ping Sheng three-level clothing edges on the chest. ㊂ Active model of the Battle of Niuzhuang. The Japanese army fired at the Qing army, and the Qing army resisted with broadswords, using electric lights to represent the sparks of guns and cannons. The explainer said that this projection was on March 4th of Meiji 28, when the Japanese army attacked Niuzhuang City and occupied it on the 5th. The Japanese army was the 3rd Division Commander Lieutenant General Katsura Taro and the 5th Division Commander Lieutenant General Oku Yasukata of the First Army. ㊃ Two "horizontal plaques" presented by Huo Liangshun, the acting capital officer of the Yulei Yingchang Xuechang Zhengzong Palace, and seven students, craftsmen, soldiers, etc., with the words "Cheers Resound". ㊄ Boxer Rebellion, model of the Japanese army attacking Beijing City. The explainer said that in May of Meiji 33, the Chinese Boxers rose up and the Allied Forces attacked Beijing. Under the command of Lieutenant General Yamaguchi Motoomi of the 5th Division of the Japanese Army, they were incorporated into the Allied Forces. This was the beginning of Japan's gaining the right to speak in the East Asian situation. After that, the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the increase of Russian troops in the three northeastern provinces caused the Russo-Japanese War in later years. ㊅ First general attack on Lushun Fortress, model of the Japanese army forcibly occupying Panlong Mountain. The Third Army under General Nogi captured the fortress in one day. Before the fall, the Japanese army attacked for six days and nights, suffering 15,800 casualties without any progress.

### Japanese Consuls in North China Hold Meeting in Tianjin

Led by Horiuchi to Study Concrete Opinions; Important Consultation Held Centered Around Morishima

Tianjin Correspondence: The meeting of Japanese consuls stationed in North China this time can be divided into two stages: the meeting held on the 21st and 22nd, which was centered on Consul General Horiuchi in Tianjin to discuss diplomatic issues; the meeting held on the 24th, which was centered on Morishima, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China, to decide on specific plans. Therefore, the meeting on the 21st and 22nd can also be regarded as a preparatory meeting, and the results of the discussion were to provide consultations for the meeting on the 24th. Those who discussed on the 21st and 22nd were Consul General Horiuchi in Tianjin, Consuls Ogihara, Oe, Kishii, Vice Consuls Nishida, Tanaka, Fujita, Nagai, Consul General Arino stationed in Jinan, Consul General Otaka stationed in Qingdao, Consul Nakan rooted stationed in Zhangjiakou, Consul Fujii stationed in Shanhaiguan, etc. In addition, there were Beppu, an official of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched to inspect the situation in Qingdao, and Kato, Chargé d'Affaires of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing. The meeting opened at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Beppu conveyed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs's opinions on the Qingdao case and reported on his inspection of the situation with Consul General Otaka stationed in Qingdao. After discussion, the participants divided into three items: ㊀ □□ issues, ㊁ North China diplomatic issues, ㊂ Economic development issues for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM that day. At 9:00 AM on the 22nd, the meeting continued to discuss concrete opinions on the previous three matters and adjourned at noon. There was a rest on the 23rd. At 1:50 PM that day, Morishima Morihito, the newly appointed counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China, arrived in Tianjin by China Airlines flight after meeting with Kita in Shanghai to exchange views on the current situation. Japanese consuls all went to Dongjuzi Airport to welcome him, and then accompanied him to the official residence of the Japanese Consul General in the British Concession to rest. In the afternoon, Morishima and Kita freely exchanged views with the consuls in the official residence until late. Horiuchi hosted a banquet to entertain them. At 9:00 AM on the 24th, Morishima took the lead to convene a meeting with the consuls of North China at the official residence of the Consul General as the venue. There was a break at 1:30 PM. Then, they responded to the invitation of Commander Tashiro of the Japanese Garrison to a banquet, and exchanged views on the spot. The discussion continued at 3:00 PM and did not end until 5:30 PM. The Consuls General of Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan rested briefly after the meeting and then held a discussion meeting at the original location at around 6:00 PM, making important decisions. Otaka was responsible for handling them and returned to Qingdao on the 25th to handle them. Morishima scheduled to take an early train to Beijing on the 25th to transfer to Tongzhou for investigation, and then took a Huitong plane to Dalian to return to the country via this route to report.

It is found that the assembly of Japanese consuls in North China this time, and Morishima's coming, in the present-day mission is to instruct the Qingdao affair negotiation policy, in the future mission, on behalf of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to come and listen to the opinions of the consuls on the spot, for the specific aspects to be summarized and resolved, carrying them back to the country, for the recent Japanese Land, Foreign, and Finance Ministers' meeting to study the reference materials on the China policy, to facilitate Kawagoe's return to office, to re-introduce the factors of adjusting diplomacy. Therefore, this meeting is not to be taken lightly. (24th)

### A Prospective View of Zhejiang Province's Finances (Continued)

Speaking of fisheries, our province has 996 kilometers of coastline. The annual output of fisheries once reached a record of 50 million, but it has plummeted recently and is unable to reach even 20 million. There are certainly many reasons for this. If we want to revive the fisheries, the first thing we must do is improve the current situation, reduce the burden on fishermen, and reduce the cost of production. This is the most important thing. On the one hand, we will implement the public sale of fish under supervision so that fishermen can truly benefit. On the other hand, we must gradually improve the organization of fishermen and provide fishermen's loans. After these preliminary tasks are completed, I think Zhejiang's fisheries will be able to barely compete with foreign products in the market. Then we will modernize it further, with cold storage facilities, new-style fishing boats, and so on, which can be implemented one after another. After I arrived in Zhejiang, I asked the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Academia Sinica to send a survey team to the coast to investigate aquatic products. They are currently working actively. At the same time, we are also planning to establish a marine biology research institute. Starting from this aspect, I think our province's fisheries definitely have great hope.

The remaining industrial and mining construction is also very important. Now, a mineral resources survey team has been jointly formed by the Institute of Geology of the Academia Sinica and the Construction Department of our province. Moreover, experts from the Ministry of Industry, Central University, and Zhejiang University have been invited to participate in conducting a systematic survey of the geology and mineral resources of our province. The first phase of the work is scheduled for one year. We are currently paying attention to the lead-zinc mines in Zhuji, the tin mines in Qingtian, the coal mines in Jiangshan, Qu County, and Changxing, the fluorite mines in 17 counties including Sheng County and Wuxing, and the antimony mines in Changhua. We will start with these few places to explore the tin mines. There is already a preliminary report, and it is hoped that the content will be more abundant than that of Fujian. We are now doing further exploration work, and it is expected that mining can begin soon. As for the other mines, we will proceed with them successively after the preliminary exploration work is substantially completed. As for the alum mines in Pingyang, which are world-famous for their production, large-scale industrial application methods are currently being studied by the Institute of Chemistry of the Academia Sinica for a long period. Up to now, they have obtained several methods in their research, which is to take the main part to crack aluminum and use the by-products to make fertilizer. This research has been substantially completed, but it is only a laboratory success. We are now also planning to build a cement plant and a glass factory near the Changxing coal mine. We know that the limestone used by the Shanghai Cement Plant is supplied by Changxing. Now that coal and stone are in the same place, and there are quartz mines nearby, it is, of course, more suitable for us to build a factory there.

The promotion of the sugar industry has also begun. Now we have rented 500 acres of tidal land in Pingyang and are going to Java, Xiamen, and other places to handle several improved varieties of sugar cane, first to do an experiment. By next spring, we will know the initial results. If it is good, then we can actively propagate sugar cane and then proceed to establish a new-style sugar refinery. Other things, such as the improvement of the paper-making industry, the improvement of the brewing industry, and the improvement and expansion of the tea industry, are also in our plans. Speaking of the seed improvement and promotion of general agriculture, it is best to have a large number of seeds prepared first. Because our past rice seed improvement has only reached 200,000 mu of propagation this year, and wheat seed only has 50,000 mu, the number is too small. So this year, we are preparing a large number of seeds, preparing for a larger promotion next year. Plant diseases and insect pests are very important issues. Our province has paid considerable attention to insects in the past, so we have restored the Insect Bureau this year.

Our province's scenic spots and historical sites have always been famous tourist areas throughout the country. There are still many places suitable for recuperation and tourism that need to be developed. Therefore, the importance of developing the tourism industry in our province is at least no less than silk and seafood, as long as we use it appropriately.

In short, production and construction are a myriad of things. Today, I am just briefly talking about the projects that are already planned, and there is no mention of any plans, because if we want the economy of our province to truly improve, we must first have various construction projects as a foundation, and at the same time, there must be various construction projects to promote it. We must first have a financial foundation. Now that the finances are not on the right track, production and construction are really out of the question. Next year's economic construction can only be regarded as a preparation work. At least one or two years later, a procedural and long-term economic construction plan can be put forward.

From now on, the finances of our province, as I said above, will actively streamline and tighten on the one hand and try to open up sources of income on the other hand, not only in the negative aspects, such as the reorganization of financial administration and the rectification of tax revenue, but also in the positive aspects, that is, to work hard on production construction and cultivate tax sources. At present, our province's finances are the most heavily indebted province compared with other provinces, and it seems that we have reached the end of our rope. However, we have 21 million people and an area of 101,300 square li, and we also have a cultural foundation. If the people of our province, both inside and outside the province, can be mobilized to work together for their hometown, use cooperative methods, take science as the foundation, and do it practically and in a modern way, there is definitely a lot of hope.

Military Supplies Discovered in Empty Coffin

A large number of military supplies were found in an empty coffin in the Yue Wang Temple in Dong Tang City, the eighth district, (on the 25th), including two rifles, three Mauser pistols, a wooden box of bullets totaling about 5,000 rounds, and seven sets of gray cloth military uniforms. It is reported that the empty coffin is the coffin of Zhou Sanbao, the owner of the De Tai Fish Market in the town. It has been made for many years and kept in the temple. Now that it is dry, craftsmen have been hired to paint it. When the lid was opened, the above-mentioned military supplies were discovered. They were immediately reported to the local security group for removal. However, these guns were lost by the town's security group four years ago. Now that they have been found, the condition of the items suggests that they have been frequently used. Therefore, it is suspected that the recent robberies in various townships are related to these guns. It is said that the number lost by the group was not limited to this, so the search continues in various empty coffins.

### General MacArthur Discusses Philippine Island Defense Plan

A Word in Shanghai on Tuesday: Sovereignty Cannot Be Shared

The Continental Daily reports that General MacArthur, Special Representative of the U.S. Department of War, accompanied by his wife, passed through Shanghai on the Coolidge President on Tuesday, heading to Manila. It is said that Mr. MacArthur was ordered to the Philippines two years ago to assist the Philippine government in drafting a defense plan for the Philippine Islands and to reorganize the Philippine Army. In February of this year, he accompanied Philippine President Quezon to Washington to discuss economic and political issues concerning the Philippine Islands. After arriving in Shanghai, he spoke with guests about the defense of the Philippine Islands, saying that the current defense procedures in the Philippines are only for defense and should not be interpreted otherwise. When asked if the Philippine Islands are in danger of being attacked, Mr. MacArthur replied that although there are various rumors, he is very skeptical of any country in the Pacific with malicious intentions toward the Philippines. He believes that such rumors are only believed by those with selfish motives. The Philippine Islands are a democratic country, so they implement a democratic foreign policy and are determined not to participate in any disturbances and are determined to keep disturbances away from the Philippine Islands. The status of the Philippine Islands is the same as that of Switzerland. Switzerland has not participated in wars for more than a hundred years, but Switzerland still maintains a large military force to prevent any unexpected events. The Philippine Islands are also the same. And the self-defense of the Philippine Islands is a stable factor in the Pacific. Since we cannot recognize that Switzerland has the intention of invading neighboring countries, others cannot point out that the Philippine Islands' military deployment has the intention of invading. When asked if Quezon's trip was successful, Mr. MacArthur replied that this trip was for explanation purposes. From a global perspective, the United States and the Philippine Islands sympathize with each other and try to find a permanent solution to the problem so that both sides can benefit. Mr. MacArthur then talked about US-Philippine trade, saying that the biggest obstacle at present is the issue of sovereignty. Sovereignty is like a wife and cannot be shared by two people. Senator Buengamino of the Philippines, who returned to the Philippines from the United States on the Coolidge President, believes that Quezon's trip will definitely be successful and that the United States will allow the Philippine Islands to be independent before 1940. President Quezon, accompanied by his wife and three children, went from Washington to Paris and has now returned to the United States. Quezon may take the Hoover President or the next Coolidge President, passing through Shanghai to return to the Philippines. His wife plans to stay in the United States temporarily, as her three children will study at a school near Washington.

### The Arrival of the Second Eurasia Aircraft in Shanghai

No News from Long-Wave Radio Yet; Preparing to Welcome on the Way

The Eurasia Aviation Corporation ordered two JU5.2 three-engine large aircraft from the German Junkers Aircraft Factory. The first aircraft was flown to China last month, and the second was flown by German pilot Han Lusi on the morning of the 19th of this month, taking off from Berlin, passing through Athens, Yaoda, Karachi, Calcutta, Yangon, Bangkok, Hanoi, and Hong Kong to China. According to the company's news, although the aircraft has radio equipment, it is long-wave, so it cannot communicate directly until it reaches Hong Kong. Since the aircraft departed from Berlin, no telegram has been sent, so as of last night, the exact time of its arrival in Shanghai was still unknown. However, it must be very safe on the way. The company is now preparing to welcome it, and the accompanying personnel include mechanic Keliz, radio operator Sipu Duwei, and engineer Feiqu.

### Gauze Sales Are Brisk, but Yarn Stocks Are Greatly Reduced and Prices Are Skyrocketing

Factories Are Rushing to Spin and Temporarily Suspending the Sale of Futures; Workers' Skills Have Been Exhaustively Improved

Since the national agricultural harvest and the gradual recovery of the countryside, gauze has been selling well due to increased purchasing power. Although Chinese and foreign yarn factories are working day and night to spin, they are always unable to meet the demand, and yarn prices are skyrocketing and yarn stocks are greatly increased, totaling about 30,000 bales. Various yarn factories have suspended the sale of futures. The details are as follows:

Yarn Stocks Are Greatly Reduced and Prices Are Skyrocketing

After the brisk sales of gauze, the factories that had been shut down have successively started operations by means of leasing, reorganization, resumption of business, and entrusted management. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are 31 Chinese merchants, 4 British merchants, and 30 Japanese merchants, all of which are working day and night to spin. Due to the brisk sales of gauze, the yarn spun by various factories is not enough to supply the buyers, and the market has tended to be in short supply. Yarn prices are skyrocketing. The standard yarn price of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn Exchange for May has risen to 281 yuan per bale in national currency. Yarn stocks have been greatly reduced. Taking Shanghai as an example, the total is less than 30,000 bales.

Factories Are Temporarily Suspending the Sale of Futures

The largest yarn stock in Shanghai was as high as 150,000 bales. The current stock is less than 30,000 bales. Most of these 30,000 bales of yarn are stored in the godowns of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn Exchange. As for the Chinese and foreign yarn factories, the weaving factories and users in various places are in great need, and the flowers spun are not enough to be distributed, so they have had to temporarily suspend the sale of futures. There is no yarn in the godowns of various factories. As for the sales of cotton, although they are selling well along with yarn, because of the national cotton harvest last year, the price has not risen as much as cotton yarn. The exchange price for May is 48 yuan per dan in national currency.

Yarn Factories Improve Workers' Skills

Chinese and foreign yarn factories are gradually finding ways to improve workers' skills, which is of great importance to reducing costs. Taking the average ability of each worker in Chinese factories to manage spindles as an index of 100 in 1933, it was 132.81 in 1934, 146.87 in 1935, and 155.71 in 1936. Foreign yarn factories in China have been working hard to improve workers' skills. However, workers' wages have also gradually increased, such as voluntarily increasing workers' wages and improving workers' treatment. Chinese yarn factories have also recently voluntarily increased workers' wages.

### Resumption of Navigation on the Sichuan River; China Merchants New Ships Completed

Two or Three Ships Will Be Completed Next Spring; Official Losses Will Be Resumed First

Since the China Merchants Bureau's Emei ship was damaged after hitting a reef, it abandoned the Sichuan River route. The plan to resume the route has not been successful due to a lack of ships. The Kuaili ship was originally assigned to the Hankou to Yichang route (1,292 gross tons, 879 net tons). Later, in view of business needs, the Datong ship was rented from Yixiang Shipping Bureau to join the route (1,196 gross tons, 640 net tons). As for the route above Yichang, new ships have now been ordered from the Jiangnan Shipyard to resume it. A total of three ships are planned. The first ship, named Jinjiang, is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. After completion, it will resume the Yiyu route.

### Juxingcheng Bank's Handling of Sichuan Relief Bonds

Yesterday's Letter Reply to Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai

Regarding the 1 million yuan of public bonds previously allocated by the Central Government to relieve the Sichuan disaster, the Ministry of Finance stated that the funds were delayed in being remitted to Sichuan. According to a telegram from prominent Sichuan gentry, personnel had been dispatched to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the delay. The Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai also inquired with Juxingcheng Bank because the funds were handled by the bank. The bank sent a letter to the association yesterday explaining the sales process. The original letter is as follows:

Respected Sirs,

We have read in the newspaper that your association proposed in the second item that Juxingcheng Bank should be requested to provide a detailed reply to this association regarding when the 1 million yuan of relief bonds were remitted and where they were remitted, in order to dispel public doubts.

We hereby present the circumstances of our bank's entrusted sale of public bonds and remittance of funds as follows:

The drought in Sichuan is severe, and victims are everywhere. Previously, the Ministry of Finance allocated 1 million yuan of E-type unified public bonds to Chairman Zhu of the Relief Committee to sell and bring the funds into Sichuan for emergency relief. At that time, fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai were running around and calling out. Manager Wang Nanzhi of our bank also participated in the appeal. He was instructed by Chairman Zhu to assist in the sale of the bonds. Personnel dispatched by the Relief Committee delivered the aforementioned 1 million yuan of public bonds to us on April 15th and 16th. They were subsequently sold on the stock exchange at market prices. The total price received was 714,362.42 yuan.

Public bonds must be settled and received on the 29th of the month. Manager Wang Nanzhi of our bank believed that the Sichuan disaster was serious, the victims were starving, and the public was uneasy. Disaster relief could not be delayed. He negotiated with Chairman Zhu to fly to Sichuan as soon as possible to comfort the victims. He also agreed with Chairman Zhu that if the aforementioned relief funds were urgently needed before the public bonds were settled on April 29th, Manager Wang Nanzhi of our bank was willing to be responsible for negotiating with the financial community in Chongqing to advance the funds in full. He also negotiated with Director Liu Hangchen to send a telegram to the Chongqing Banking Association to prepare funds for support in order to avoid discounting and consuming more funds.

Therefore, Chairman Zhu decided to fly to Sichuan on April 19th with Commissioner Cao sent by the Ministry. However, because the procedures for surveying the disaster in Sichuan were not completed, the funds prepared by the financial community in Chongqing were never withdrawn.

Subsequently, on April 29th, the public bonds were settled. That morning, personnel from the Accounting Committee came to our bank and transferred the full amount of 714,000 yuan to the Bank of Communications to be remitted to the Central Bank of China in Nanjing. Our bank's entrusted sales procedures were then completed. As for how the funds were subsequently disbursed and remitted to Sichuan, it was entirely the responsibility of the Relief Committee, and our bank was not involved.

We are honored by your association's attention and hereby present the circumstances as described above for your reference.

Sincerely,

Juxingcheng Bank, Shanghai

### Severe Disaster in Gansu Province

Relief Association Reports by Letter; 20,000 Yuan Will Be Remitted to Lanzhou Today

The Joint Charity Relief Association of Shanghai received a letter from the Relief Committee yesterday reporting on the disaster situation in various counties of Gansu Province. The counties that suffered the most severe natural disasters included Jiuquan, Wuwei, and 13 other counties. The counties that suffered the next most severe natural disasters included Gaolan, Lintao, and 26 other counties. The counties that suffered relatively light natural disasters included Xiahe, Jingtai, and 11 other counties. The counties that suffered the most severe bandit disasters included Huanxian, Zhenning, and 31 other counties. The counties that suffered the next most severe bandit disasters included Huixian, Liangdang, and 11 other counties. The counties that suffered relatively light bandit disasters included Tianshui, Xihe, and 9 other counties. A total of 39 counties suffered both bandit disasters and natural disasters, including Qingyang, Zhenning, Zhenyuan, Guyuan, Minxian, Weiyuan, Tongwei, and Longxi.

Gansu Province has always been known for its poverty. Now, it has suffered such a catastrophe. The dying disaster victims cannot seek death or find life. The people of Gansu Province rely entirely on farming and animal husbandry. Since the natural disasters and bandit disasters, the grain and livestock stored in each county have been plundered. Not only is the livelihood of the people currently hopeless, but also the spring plowing this year has completely failed to sow seeds. The land is red for thousands of miles, and the starving are everywhere. If a remedy is not planned in advance, the disaster survivors will have no hope. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will be hungry for themselves and drown their own feelings, and donate enthusiastically so that they can be remitted to the scattered shocks. The life and death of flesh and blood are immeasurable.

The Joint Charity Relief Association of Shanghai yesterday telegraphed Zhu Qinglan of the Relief Committee, "The Provincial Government of Xi'an left to transfer to the Relief Committee. The Commissioner Zhu Qinglan's Xunjian, Jingdian is fully aware of the tragedy of Gan Zai, which is very deep. The association allocates 20,000 yuan for relief. It will be remitted to the Beijing Relief Committee on the same day and transferred to Lanzhou for release. A special reply, the Shanghai Charity Relief Association kowtows."

However, yesterday afternoon, the bureau received a telegram from the rescuers of the Haiyuan ship, saying that the holes in the two cabins have been repaired, but there are still some nail holes on the iron plate that have not been filled.

Once it is changed, it is deeply worried that the ships will not know the reason and cause the disaster of being grounded and hitting shallowly, so they fly to inform all Jianglun to pay attention, and at the same time, they urgently find a way to find the light boat and move it to its original position to ensure navigation safety.

### Representatives of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai Silk Industry Petitioned in Beijing Last Night

The import tax rates of man-made silk and its woven products are vastly different from those of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai Silk Weaving Federation. The differences are unbalanced, so that foreign silk cloths can be sold in large quantities in the domestic market, affecting domestic silk merchants. A special emergency meeting was recently convened by the industry associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, and it was decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition the relevant hospitals. It is learned that Wang Jiean has been designated as a representative in Shanghai. Wang is prepared to accompany Hu Zipei, Shen Boming, Shi Chunshan and other representatives from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Wuxing, Shengze and other places, and will take the night express train to Beijing last night.

From the 28th, they will go to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and other hospitals to request the rapid revision of the man-made silk tax law, in order to conform to the purpose of maintaining national production with the balance of tariffs. According to a reporter from Dagongshe, the central government is also very concerned about the revision of this tax law, but the matter involves diplomatic issues. My country has been weak for a long time and has been subjected to all kinds of unreasonable constraints from foreign countries, which is not limited to this one. The process is more tortuous, and in the future, I hope that the people of the whole country will work hard to love themselves and cultivate national strength, so that any constraints can be destroyed.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Hospital to Cancel the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Tax

Foreign rice is tax-free, let alone domestic agricultural products, named "Teqi" and should be cancelled as soon as possible

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed yesterday to request the abolition of the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax. Nanjing Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Finance•Guangdong Provincial Government Xunjian, on the 25th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, the letter from the Shanghai Guangdong Miscellaneous Grain Association opened that the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax has a unique name and far-reaching toxins. In the past, the warlords held power and recognized the peanut oil, bean grains and other items transported from various provinces to Guangdong as imported goods for the Hong Kong population, and violently added emblems, which caused merchants and farmers to be in trouble. Please exempt them from the exemption. The Ministry of Finance issued a number of 10413 replies, and the Electricity Department was fully aware of the situation in Guangdong. The Guangdong Bureau was pacified, the state affairs were renewed, and the Ministry of Finance had ordered Song Jian, the Director of Finance, to abolish the unfair donations and taxes that had been presented to the Ministry. According to the above information, it is up to the overall management to handle it. This batch of and other reasons, the illegality of the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax, as early as the authorities' Dong Jian, during the winter last year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance had reduced the special tax by 20%, which is the authorities' intention to abolish the illegal Agricultural Special Tax. For all to see, the merchants could only endure the pain and wait for the grace because the financial situation of Guangdong Province was not sufficient at that time. After the business tax in Guangdong Province was reorganized this year, it has increased several times, and the income tax has been organized in accordance with the central government's order. The treasury has been more affluent than in the past. The people of Guangdong have enthusiastically paid the legal taxes of the country and the local governments, and the taxes that Guangdong Province has conducted illegally are still tolerated by the government and are not abolished. The people of Guangdong have always been subordinate to the central government, so they should not be treated differently. Moreover, it was found that the Guangdong Financial Department reduced the special tax by 10% in the winter last year. At the same time, the Guangdong currency continued to fall by more than 20%. The pain caused by the special tax to the people of Guangdong was never reduced in the slightest. It has been delayed until now, and it is really impatient. Recently, foreign rice is allowed to be exempted from tax, but agricultural products from all provinces need special taxes when transported to Guangdong. There is even more incomprehension in terms of reasoning. For this reason, I have been told that the situation is special, and I would like to write a special letter to the municipal chamber of commerce and submit it to the central hospitals, ordering Guangdong Province to immediately abolish the agricultural special tax on the same day, so as to relieve the merchants and the suffering of the people. Based on this investigation, this case has been reported to the members by the association in the past, and please submit it to the hospital for instructions to abolish it. It is only because the Guangdong government has not been unified that it has been delayed. Now that the government orders are consistent, how can this evil government that hurts farmers and businesses be allowed to exist again? To show its uniqueness, the permission is hereby given, and the situation is urgent. For the special transfer to your association, restate the previous situation, and promptly submit a reclamation hospital to strictly order the Guangdong Province to abolish the agricultural special tax on a certain day, so as to relieve the suffering of the people. It is found that the Guangdong Province has collected the agricultural special tax, and the festival has been reported to the association for cancellation according to the situation. In the past, it was read in the newspaper that the central government has always advocated the abolition of taxes and miscellaneous taxes in various provinces and cities. The Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax is the worst of the excessive taxes and hinders the transportation and sale of agricultural products from various provinces. Foreign rice and grains are exempted from taxation, and only the illegal agricultural special tax is still collected. How can it be said to be flat? It is reasonable to inform the hospital and the ministry of your situation, and quickly ask your hospital to issue an order and ask the Guangdong Province to abolish the agricultural special tax by order, so as to conform to the tax system, and to relieve the suffering of the people with no end. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows with seal.

### Kneeling to Propose Marriage with a Sincere Attitude, but After the Marriage Was Agreed Upon, He Enticed and Abandoned Her

The Butcher Shop Owner is Too Dishonest; The Matchmaker Shares the Taste of Iron Bars

Hu Yu, a housewife from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, is 38 years old. Her husband is deceased. She has a daughter named Caizhen, who is 18 years old. She has a beautiful appearance and graceful demeanor. She studied dancing and graduated, but did not work as a dance hostess. She is now studying performing arts in theater. In the summer of last year, she was introduced by Gao Zigang (32 years old), a fellow villager of her father, to Jiang Weiyu (28 years old), a butcher shop owner from Pudong who currently lives at No. 51, Jianyeli, Fuli Road, French Concession. Jiang saw that the girl was beautiful and thought she was a fairy. His legal wife had just divorced, and he was looking for a suitable permanent companion. So, in early July last year, he entrusted Gao Zigang as a matchmaker to propose marriage to the Hu family. At first, Hu Yu and her daughter Hu Caizhen refused to agree because Jiang's age was too far apart from the girl's. Jiang intended to go to the girl's home in person with the matchmaker to kneel and propose marriage. Hu Yu and Hu Caizhen saw that Jiang was sincerely proposing marriage and, according to the matchmaker, Jiang had property and could be expected to live a comfortable life in the future. Therefore, the Hu and Jiang families agreed to the marriage in person, and it was agreed that a betrothal gift and jewelry would be required for the engagement. It was scheduled for both parties to get engaged at the Dagali Restaurant on July 21 last year, and Jiang entrusted Gao Zigang, the matchmaker, with 40 guest tickets from the Dagali Restaurant to be sent to the girl's home for the girl's family to invite relatives and friends to attend. Hu Yu was overjoyed that her daughter's lifelong happiness was entrusted to her and was preparing for the wedding. Who knew that Jiang Weiyu's actions were all false pretenses? Seeing that the girl's family had agreed to the engagement and the goal had been achieved, he enticed Hu Caizhen to go to the Yangzi Hotel on the nights of July 18 and 19 to open a room and have illicit relations for two nights. After that, he put the marriage out of his mind and did not ask or hear about it. When the date of the daughter's engagement arrived, Jiang did not take any action, and Hu Yu learned that her daughter had been enticed and defiled. She was shocked and immediately found the original matchmaker, Gao Zigang, to reason with him. Gao also procrastinated and avoided seeing her. Hu Yu then accompanied her daughter Hu Caizhen to retain lawyers Yang Xunqiu and Zhang, and filed a complaint with the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Jiang Weiyu and Gao Zigang of seduction. After investigation by the prosecutor, they filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Land Court on charges of obstructing morals. The plaintiff also filed an incidental civil suit, seeking compensation for losses such as consolation money of 10,000 yuan. The Land Court opened a trial at one time, but the trial was suspended because Jiang and others refused to appear in court. A warrant was issued to arrest the defendant in the case. Until now, Hu Haitang, the younger brother of Hu Yu's husband, that is, the uncle of Hu Caizhen, learned of the whereabouts of the original matchmaker Gao Zigang. Only after finding Gao did he learn of Jiang's address. The two went to wait at the entrance of Jianyeli, Fuli Road at 10 am on the 25th. Seeing Jiang leaving the alley, they shouted and arrested him and took him to the French Concession Police Station and reported the previous situation. The police sent detectives to investigate and found it to be true. The detective head detained Jiang and Gao. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Second Court. After Judge Liao Yan interrogated them, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi clarified the case. According to the plaintiff Hu's mother and daughter's report on the course of seduction and defilement, Jiang admitted to seduction in court. The court ordered the defendants to be detained and await the Shanghai Local Court to come and pick them up for interrogation. It is heard that Jiang originally planned to marry Hu, but he declared bankruptcy and was under economic pressure and unable to maintain the marriage. His divorced wife held huge assets in her hands. After being persuaded by someone, Jiang abandoned his previous resentment with his divorced wife and reconciled, reuniting and living together at No. 51, Jianyeli, Fuli Road, and put aside the marriage with the Hu family. But it is difficult to escape the sanctions of the law. The two nights of romance are like clouds and smoke, and now they are suffering the taste of iron bars.

### Unclear Lawsuit Over Partnership to Open a Store

Overseas Chinese Zhao Yin-xuan and Wen Gan-gao returned to Shanghai from Holland. They bought groceries at the Xiehe Tea Food Store on Bansongyuan Road and became acquainted with the store owner Li Zhenji. Li immediately persuaded them to invest, so they partnered to open the Daoxiangcun Tea Food Store at No. 2 Waitan, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Li was the manager. Not long after, a disagreement arose with Li due to accounting issues. Zhang Genyuan, a salesman from Guanshengyuan, learned of the situation and instructed Peng Chungeng, a staff member of the store, to discuss with Zhao to drive Li away. Zhang joined the company with a capital of 400 yuan. Zhao was appointed as honorary manager, and Zhang was appointed as manager. After only three months, the store was in a chaotic and irreparable state. Zhang then filed a complaint with the police station and had Zhao and his brother Zhao Hui'an and eleven store employees arrested and brought to court. It was found that there was 3 yuan and 50 cents of unaccounted funds, and Zhao was sentenced to six months in prison, while the others were acquitted. An appeal is in progress. However, the store owed rent and was provisionally seized by the landlord. Recently, Zhang reached a settlement with the landlord and the store was unsealed. Zhao Hui'an immediately went to the store to raise objections, but there was no result. He then went to the Land Court to press the alarm bell to complain about his grievances, but was instructed to request preservation of property from the Civil Court. The procedure was not compliant, and there was no result. Zhao Hui'an then filed a false accusation lawsuit, and the litigation continues endlessly, it is said.

### Tram Fares in the Two Concessions Will Be Readjusted

Changing Copper Coins to New Subsidiary Currency, Effective June 1st

Since the implementation of the new currency system policy in our country, the bus fares in the Public Concession of this city have been uniformly changed from copper coins to the new subsidiary currency. It is learned that the tramcars, both tracked and trackless, in the Public Concession will also uniformly change to the new subsidiary currency to readjust the price list from June 1st. Those that previously used copper coins as the unit will be changed to one cent of subsidiary currency as the unit. The readjustment method is roughly the same as that of the buses. The tram company issued a notice saying, "Starting from Tuesday, June 1, 1937, all current old copper coin fares for all tracked and trackless trams in the Public Concession will be converted to the new subsidiary currency. The new fares will be posted in the tracked and trackless trams starting from June 1, 1937. Secretary Acting Manager Prock."

In addition, the tram company of the French Concession has been calculating the prices of its tracked and trackless trams in copper coins, which has been quite inconvenient. Now, in order to vigorously implement the new currency system, it has been decided to readjust the fares from June 1st, uniformly calculated in the new subsidiary currency.

### Wu Zhenming, Who Forged Chiang Kai-shek's Seal, Appeals

Intending to seek mass welfare, the appellant requests the original judgment to be revoked

Wu Zhenming, a 14-year-old student from Yancheng, Jiangsu, studying in the third grade of the Jiangwan Law School, forged Chiang Kai-shek's name card and seal to pay his respects to Acting Mayor Yu, intending to show off his own writings. He was discovered, arrested, and brought to the local court. He was sentenced to three months' imprisonment by Judge Wu of the Criminal Court for the crime of forging documents. Wu Zhenming did not accept the original judgment and retained lawyer Hu Yuanjun to file an appeal with the Jiangsu Higher Court. In his appeal statement, he quoted classics and discussed legal principles, saying that the establishment of crimes of using forged private documents and forging seals in criminal law requires that they be sufficient to harm the public or others. Conversely, even if there is such behavior, if it benefits the public or others, the crime is not established. The appellant, with the one gain of a fool, has written "A Review of Improving Chinese Coffins" and "An Outline of Improving Police Administration". He wanted to present these ideas, but because his words were too light and there was no way to advance, and the lower situation was difficult to convey to the higher levels, in a state of boredom, he tried the law by forging Chiang Kai-shek's name card and seal, hoping to avoid the obstacles of the doormen and directly reach the important position, so that he could gain a place of respect and raise his eyebrows. If he could present the two improvements to the emperor one day, the society and the people might receive his benefits. The appellant, as a student with a clean body, had no selfish intentions or intention to harm the public or others. The court accused him of forging documents and other crimes, which is like Jia Yi's "Security Policy", and his body is suffering extreme unease. If he had known this, he should have hidden them in famous mountains to be passed down to future generations. Why take humiliation? In short, the appellant's behavior has no malice, only the behavior of using forged private documents and seals, which did not harm the public or Chiang Kai-shek's personal interests, and was intended to seek welfare for the masses. There is no establishment requirement for Article 210 and Article 217, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, so please revoke the original judgment and declare him innocent, and so on.

### Young Schneider Paralyzed and Speeding to America

Medical Equipment Along the Way, the Father Spared No Expense

The Continental News reported that the American youth Schneider was traveling the world last year when he arrived in Shanghai and suddenly became paralyzed, unable to breathe. He relied on a type of artificial respirator called an iron lung at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital to preserve his life. Mr. Schneider has been treated in the hospital for many months, but he still cannot be separated from the iron lung for a moment. He now plans to return to the United States on the President Coolidge on June 6 to continue treatment. The ship is currently passing through Shanghai on its way to Manila and will specially build a room in the ship for Mr. Schneider when it returns from that port via Hong Kong.

### A Dance Hostess Commits Suicide by Poisoning Due to Obstacles in Love

A College Student Cannot Afford the Bride Price; The Girl's Father Blames Yu Aijuan

Yao Aixiang, a Jia Ding girl residing at No. 234, Han Yanli Road, is only sixteen years old. She has been working as a dance hostess at the Da Hu Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, she developed a relationship with Ruan Chengji, a student at Great China University, because of dancing. When her father, Yao Chenying, learned about it, he planned to marry his daughter to Ruan, but Ruan had to pay a considerable bride price. However, Ruan is a student and has no ability to produce the funds, which resulted in the love of two people being obstructed and unable to grow old together. Recently, Yao also has not been working at Da Hu for two months because of this. Suddenly, at 11 PM on the 24th of this month, Yao Aixiang secretly swallowed poison. At that time, her family did not know anything. It was not until noon the next day that it was discovered. She was rushed to the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital for treatment, but because she was deeply poisoned, the treatment was ineffective. She died at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday. The Hongkou Police Station received a report and immediately ordered detectives to transport the body to the autopsy room on Ferron Road. After investigation, the detectives obtained two suicide notes from Yao, one to her parents and one to her fellow dance hostess Yu Aijuan, accusing her of being unfeeling and unjust. Yesterday, Song Gensen, the prosecutor of the Special First Court, came to the autopsy room. After examining the body, he ascended to the public office. According to the investigation report from the police station, the deceased committed suicide by poisoning herself due to obstacles in her love with Ruan Chengji. The deceased's father claimed that Yu Aijuan, a dance hostess in the same venue as the deceased, was jealous of the deceased's flourishing dance career and therefore courted Ruan Chengji, but his daughter had no intention of marrying Ruan. One day, Yu and Ruan accompanied his daughter to a hotel, and Yu locked the two of them in a room, and then the relationship occurred. He suspected that Yu intended that his daughter would no longer dance after marrying someone, so that her dance career might be better because of this. His daughter's suicide was caused by Yu and Ruan, and so on. Prosecutor Song examined the confession and concluded that Yao Aiyao had indeed committed suicide by taking poison before her death. The body was handed over to her father, Yao Chenying, for burial. At the same time, he declared to Yao Chenying that the death of his daughter was caused by her taking poison herself and that no one else could be held responsible. As for Ruan Chengji's obstruction of morals, he could submit evidence to the court.

### In Times of National Crisis, Strictly Guard Against Traitors Disguised as Begging Monks

Chinese Buddhist Association Stipulates Fundraising Methods - Certificate of Proof Must Be Issued by the Buddhist Branch

The Chinese Buddhist Association yesterday instructed the branches of each city and county that, according to the report from the Liyang County branch, "It has been found that recently there have been monks begging in the name of repairing temples. Upon inquiry, they are evasive, causing social suspicion or being deported, affecting formal fundraising and harming the reputation of monks across the country. The association has the responsibility to supervise, and it is proposed to clearly stipulate rectification methods. If temples in various places are damaged, if it is necessary to raise funds for repairs, they should be reported to the local Buddhist branch for verification and issuance of a fundraising certificate (if there is no association, it must be certified by the district office). If fundraising in other counties, they must go to the local Buddhist branch or district office to submit a certificate of proof for verification and issuance of a permit to show prudence and deter impostors. The funds raised should be handed over to the local Buddhist branch and remitted to the Buddhist branch where the temple is located, which will be forwarded to the temple abbot for collection. (If there is no association in the local area, it should be sent directly to the temple) to show great faith in society and avoid being robbed on the way. Any fundraising monks who do not have proof from a Buddhist association or district office should be cracked down on by the Buddhist associations in various places at any time and advised to leave the country. Especially in this time of national crisis, it is feared that unscrupulous people will disguise themselves as monks, falsely raise funds, and plot wrongdoing. It is essential that the Buddhist associations conduct strict investigations to prevent chaos. Therefore, a document is submitted to your association for verification and approval, and a circular is issued to all temples and monks across the country to comply with it, and respectfully follow it. In view of this, the rectification measures proposed by the branch are feasible and should be approved. In addition to issuing separate orders, the branch shall immediately check and handle it, and forward it to all temples under its jurisdiction for their information. This order."

### Vegetable Vendors Gather to Assault Police Officers, Tried and Sentenced for Various Crimes

Near the Xiaocai Market on Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, there are often people who sell vegetables without obtaining a license from the Public Works Bureau. At 8 am the day before, West Constable Lao Men No. 141 and Chinese Constables No. 1694, 2439, 3005, and 3056 of the Yangshupu Police Station went to the area to investigate. West Constable Lao Men checked the license of Cui Jin, an elderly woman from Anhui who was selling vegetables, but found no license. She shouted loudly, and Zhang Chen, an Anhui woman next to her, immediately attacked the West Constable's head with a bamboo shoulder pole, breaking his hat and causing bleeding. At that time, there were hundreds of stallholders, passers-by, and vegetable buyers in the vegetable market. For a time, some people shouted to hit the constables and threw bamboo poles and stones at the Chinese constables, causing minor injuries. As a result, 14 men and women, including Jiang Yonglin from Yixing, Qiao Xiaoding from Xuzhou, and Zhao Wenzhong from Pudong, were arrested, along with six bamboo poles and several stones, and taken to the police station. West Constable Lao Men was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the defendants were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the Special First Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, prosecuted them for gathering crowds to obstruct official duties under Article 136, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After interrogation by Judge Xiao Xiebin, Jiang Yonglin, Qiao Xiaoding, Cui Jin, and Zhang Chen were sentenced to eight months in prison, Zhao Wenzhong, Cui Denggui, and He Liangui were sentenced to three months, the bamboo poles and stones were confiscated, and Xia Baosheng, Chen Desheng, and seven others were acquitted.

### Fire in Lao Taiping Lane

Old Servant Injured While Escaping

At around 1:50 am yesterday morning, a sudden fire broke out on the second floor of Bao Kang Sesame Oil Shop, No. 76, Lao Taiping Lane, No. 16 Pu, Nanshi, due to the bursting of an oil pan. The flames soared and the fire became uncontrollable. The fire was extinguished after the fire brigades from each district drove out the water wagons to the scene to connect to the water and douse the fire. The fire destroyed the two floors of the shop and did not spread to other buildings. When the fire was raging, Yin Peiqing, the old servant of the shop, who was lying on the third floor, jumped from the building to escape, injuring his waist and knees.

### Jinan Vessel Found to be Smuggling Copper Coins

Totaling Over Ten Sacks, More Than Forty Thousand Coins

Since the Japanese rogues' attempts to transport copper coins by sea have been strictly investigated and repeatedly thwarted by our country's customs officers, the rogues have suffered considerable losses and are now unable to sell. They have changed their smuggling methods, taking advantage of the fact that our anti-smuggling customs officers' attention is focused on Japanese ships. Recently, they have been secretly loading copper coins onto various sea vessels bound for Hong Kong for transshipment. Customs had heard rumors of this, so they have been paying close attention when inspecting various vessels. Yesterday, when the Jinan vessel, sailing to Hong Kong and Xiamen, was scheduled to weigh anchor at 12:00, customs officers, as usual, boarded at 11:00 to conduct a thorough search before export. During the search, they discovered over ten sacks of unclaimed items in the bow of the ship. Upon inspection, they were found to be full of copper coins, estimated to be more than forty thousand. They were transported back to customs and confiscated. This is the first time such a large quantity of copper coins has been found on a sea vessel.

Random Thoughts

### Dancing in Shanghai

— Shen Jiaqian

Dancing in Shanghai has recently reached its peak. There are no fewer than twenty dance halls, big and small, in the city, and even more dance schools. This abnormal development has naturally caused unease among the "defenders of morality." Some passively shake their heads and sigh at the "decline of social customs," while others actively petitioned to ban dance halls. Later, a compromise was reached: dance halls could not operate past midnight, and the education sector prohibited middle school students from dancing. At the time, public opinion was not unified, and now there are still dance halls that "operate all night" and students wearing the most fashionable Western clothes who are dating dance hostesses.

Indeed, to say that dancing is an art is too beautiful a disguise. To say it is exercise seems even further from the truth. The reason dancing halls are so developed in Shanghai is simply because they are entertainment. It is a more advanced, peculiar (Grotesque), and erotic entertainment than watching movies or visiting brothels. And entertainment is as important to the common people as water is to fish.

Although during the "serious national crisis," dancing was once raised as a banner for "national salvation," that was because the personal relationships of those involved in dancing were not suitable as a permanent example.

Moreover, the lower classes not only want to "dance" but also like to "watch." By "watch," they naturally do not mean going to dance halls to "decipher characters," watching people flirt with dance hostesses on the dance floor, because they themselves have played such a role before. Over time, familiarity breeds contempt, and the "peculiar" becomes "ordinary." So, they want to "watch" naked bodies wearing bras and thongs swimming like snakes on stage. Also, a type of dance that specializes in swaying hips, called the hula dance, is the most popular. Usually, white Russian women perform the most in low-grade movie theaters. As for the "Kaleidoscope Troupe" and the "New 9 O'Clock Dance Troupe," which are directly imported from abroad, they are naturally even more popular. Because Western women have healthy bodies and can maximize the stimulation that the audience hopes for. These dance troupes can often make huge profits and return fully loaded.

However, at some point, Peking Opera, with red-faced and black-faced characters fighting, also began to use "sensual dancing" as a selling point. Peking Opera in Shanghai has declined sharply in recent years. Except for famous performers from Beijing and Tianjin who can still attract opera fans, theaters that specialize in continuous plays can only make efforts in the novelty and mystery of scenery and stage machinery. Finally, they have developed to the point where mandarin robes and jade legs fly together, and painted faces share the same lipstick color. I have little affinity for Peking Opera, but according to friends who have seen it, the dancing girls have neither been trained nor are they physically strong. Watching them strain their voices and wave their arms and legs on stage, one feels a little unbearable. There is no time for sympathy, let alone "stimulation"! This friend naturally cannot represent the views of the entire audience. After all, watching a play is just watching a play, not going to a disaster area to provide relief. This kind of psychoanalysis is superfluous. However, recently, the Municipal Council, because of the insertion of dancing in Peking Opera, believes that it is detrimental to public morals and will ban it. Since it is said to be "detrimental to public morals," my friend's words seem even more unreliable, because according to his "view," it should be "relief," not "prohibition." However, these matters do not require us to advise. Saying that it is "unbearable" and requires "relief" is the responsibility of philanthropists; saying that it is "detrimental to public morals" and should be "prohibited" is naturally the responsibility of the Municipal Council.

In my opinion, abnormal development is temporary, and the lower classes' need for "stimulation" will not be "satisfied" in this way. Dance halls that hold "robe dances" have also failed to attract dancers, and the "view" of some others is "unbearable." Further development is naturally even more "peculiar" and "erotic," until people like my friend "cannot bear to look" and then stop.

### A Plea for the Compatriots in Attic Rooms

— Ni Runzhi

Since the Public Concession's Municipal Council proposed the demolition of attic rooms within the concession, the people who feel most uneasy about this issue are not the residents of the attic rooms, but the people who exploit and are exploited by others, namely the so-called second landlords, third landlords, and the owners of stores. In fact, because the actual residents of the attic rooms have long become the dregs of the dregs in this capitalist society, even if the Municipal Council really cancels their little right to inhuman living in the attic rooms, some compatriots who depend on the store owners (including apprentices, clerks, and servants) have interests that can be extracted from them. Of course, someone will naturally arrange for them. Another group of attic room compatriots who are oppressed by second and third landlords (including coolies, rickshaw pullers, cart pushers, petty thieves, letter writers, cobblers, hawkers, street performers, boxers, peddlers of plasters, petty hooligans, pickpockets, extras in theaters and amusement parks, odd-job actors, bag carriers, tea servers, and a small number of laborers, musicians in brothels, miscellaneous servants, etc.) are not dependent on anyone, but they are very casual. One reason is that most of their occupations are free among the free, and second, for them, whether it is an attic room or a corner of a wall, or even in the open air, in their intuition, except for a few hours of slightly tolerable sleep at night, everyone clearly understands that the latter is better than the former. Therefore, whether it is at the entrance of an alley, under an overpass, in a corner of a wall, or in a small inn with three-story bunk beds, they can all use them casually, and there is absolutely no difference in their enjoyment. Among them, perhaps some people will naturally shout out, "Go to Zhabei, go to Nanshi."

The facts are of course very ordinary and have long been understood and understood by the general public, but I am very strange and also very depressed. I don't know if the people living in Western-style buildings and the people living in attic rooms are equally human? Do they pay taxes in the concession in the same way? On what basis does the Municipal Council want to discriminate against this group of people living in attic rooms? If it is said that they are unsanitary and unsafe, then since the Municipal Council has collected the taxes they pay, it should do its utmost to ensure their safety and sanitation. It cannot take their money and not help them avoid disasters! In any case, the fact is in front of us: the people living in attic rooms do not lack understanding of hygiene, but they lack the ability to be hygienic. They also know that sleeping in an attic room is much safer than sleeping on the street! Therefore, I say that the clever authorities of the Municipal Council should also carefully review their responsibilities. Although you have "militarism" as your only magic weapon for governing the common people, but——when the coal in the dried-up coal stove cannot be burned, the dry ashes blown up by the strong wind may blur people's eyes——what's more, there are more than 80,000 attic rooms, and the number of people exceeds 100,000!

Taking a step back and assuming that you really demolish these more than 80,000 attic rooms, may I ask the authorities of the Municipal Council, can you ensure that these more than 100,000 dregs of humanity swept out of the attic rooms will not become more unsafe and unsanitary because they have nowhere to stay and are scattered in the streets and alleys? After the second and third landlords lose these more than 100,000 dregs of humanity who can be exploited, will they still be able to obediently or have the ability to bear all the expenses for the Municipal Council (referring to the payment of taxes)? Will it cause a further increase in empty houses within the concession? Everything, everything, is a very problematic thing! Clever authorities of the Municipal Council, I think it is better to take a long-term view and come up with a proper solution!

### Funeral

— Shisi

——Random Travel Notes, Part Two

Traveling south along the Bolcar River, it gets warmer day by day. May in the south is especially noisy and warm. The scorching sun scorches our group of travelers. Our originally brown skin has become even darker. Sometimes, the strong shoulder muscles even feel prickly pain due to the friction of the luggage bag. The heat of the sun dazes our minds, making us so uncomfortable.

However, we are voluntary travelers, young people of the white and yellow races. We are going to Valera in the extreme south, the holy land of the south,

## Page 18

a city as beautiful as a flower and as dreamlike as a secluded valley! The same admiration and expectation for that secluded city, and the love of travel life, have brought us together collectively without borders or nationalities. We are as loving as brothers!

The Bolcar River flows slowly, sparkling with silver waves in the May sun. The water is so clear and blue. Small boats with white sails float lightly on the water. The banks are full of lush green banana trees. The river stretches out endlessly, and the green of the banks stretches out endlessly. We walked on the yellow sand and mud road with strong steps. Sweat soaked our backs, soaked our whole bodies. The weather is hot, and the clear water in the river entices each of us.

"Let's rest..." someone was saying.

"It's not far. There is a coconut grove ahead. Let's rest there!"

Ilauiel, who was closely following behind me, said. He is a strong Spaniard. He has lovely curly hair, lively big eyes, and a straight and high nose. Everyone likes him. He is gentle and strong, a socialist who fled from his country for ××××. This time, he wants to find a way to transfer from Valera and secretly return to his country. I have a good relationship with him.

It was a starry and moonlit night, still in Kotalcar, when I was enjoying the cool with him on the prairie. He said to me:

"From Valera, I want to transfer back to Spain."

"Oh, why?" I asked in surprise.

That night, he told me everything about himself. He said that he wanted to go back to continue the struggle. There, many kind comrades were waiting for him, and those rebellious and evil fascists, he wanted to go back.

"The coconut grove is here, let's rest." Ilauiel was so happy.

We stopped. We spread out the simple luggage of the travelers under the coconut trees. The warm and cool wind blew on us, and we felt a burst of coolness. We were all so happy. Some people knocked down the coconuts one by one, and everyone rushed to pick them up and share them.

The Bolcar River sparkles with silver waves in the sun. It is so clear. So, one after another, we all jumped into the Bolcar River. The water is warm and cool, comfortable. A naked body in the water is like sleeping on Giemons.

The scorching sun of May in the south can no longer make us feel hot. We floated in the water as we pleased, floating to the distance of the river.

"Come on..." It was such a high-pitched, short, and panting call. The second sound could no longer be heard.

A large splash of water was floating on the distant river, floating, floating... and never floated up again. Who can reach there quickly!

Two hours later, Ilauiel lay quietly in the coconut grove. His originally strong body seemed a little fatter, but it was. He was lying so quietly, but he would never wake up.

Night came. The wind was blowing the coconut leaves, making a "click, click..." sound. Around Ilauiel, gas lamps were lit, illuminating the forest as bright as day. However, no one spoke, only the sound of swaying leaves, only the sound of the wind. There was no moon or stars in the sky. It was a dark night. The Bolcar River had disappeared into the darkness.

We all stood up and stood around Ilauiel. The lights illuminated everyone's sad faces. Everyone was silent.

The May night wind was sighing, and the jungle was also crying.

Who picked up the iron shovel and shoveled the first shovel? The soil will swallow our dear companion!

My blood tensed up, like a thorny iron hammer heavily hitting my heart. I dropped the iron shovel in my hand and slumped to the ground with my head in my hands.

The soil finally swallowed Ilauiel. He lay under the mound of earth with a wooden axe and sickle inserted.

Everyone sat down around the mound, bowing their heads, without even sighing.

The wind shook the coconut trees, and the coconut trees sang "click, click..." sadly. There were no stars or moon in the sky, a dark night. The Bolcar River disappeared into the darkness, boundless darkness, endless night. Ilauiel is gone. The kind comrades in distant Spain will forever be suspicious, expectant, and nostalgic for Ilauiel. He is a mystery.

Boundless darkness, endless night, the night of the dark Bolcar River, the sad coconut grove, the travelers sitting around, holding, a sad funeral!

### Song of the Sea

— Lin Hao

On a starry night, the sea is singing again.

The sea is born to be a talented singer. It has the passion of a poet and the heroic spirit of a martyr. Like a galloping horse, it whips up wave after wave with lightning speed. Nothing can stop it. These waves can also be described as its power and prestige.

The sea is the world's first laborer. Even when it is resting, it struggles to swing its giant body and stretch its limbs, unwilling to show weakness.

The rocks on the shore become thicker and thicker, but can this stop the sea's roar and impact? Every moment, it still uses its brave nature to smash its head desperately against the rocks. Over time, the rocks gradually tremble. They cannot withstand the sea's grinding and torment. A hard body is swallowed into a weak appearance, only increasing the beauty of the external form.

The sea sings and struggles tirelessly.

The sea has the freedom to surge and an endless ambition!
