The mausoleum had been pre-arranged, and additional officers and soldiers were dispatched by the police and military to guard the avenue from Zhongshan Gate to the mausoleum. More than forty committee members attended, including Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Jiang Zuobin, Wu Jingheng, Wang Yongbin, Li Wenfan, Deng Jiayan, Ju Zheng, Luo Jialun, Wang Chonghui, and Sun Ke. Chaired by Wang Zhaoming, the ceremony began at 8:00 AM with solemn music and formal rites. The Chairman's representative respectfully presented a wreath and observed a moment of silence. Then, they proceeded in order to the mausoleum to respectfully pay their respects to the Premier's remains. After the ceremony, the committee members descended the mountain and went to the Central Party Headquarters to participate in the commemorative ceremony.

The joint commemorative ceremony of the Central Government and the National Government began at 9:00 AM. The venue was solemnly decorated. Attendees included Central Committee members Lin Sen, Wang Zhaoming, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Zou Lu, Wu Jingheng, Bo Wenwei, Li Liejun, He Yingqin, Zhou Qigang, Cheng Qian, Ye Chucang, Fang Zhi, Chu Minyi, Wang Chonghui, Jiang Zuobin, Gan Naiguang, Chen Shuren, Shi Ying, Li Wenfan, Liu Jiwen, Ma Chaojun, Wang Yongbin, Li Zonghuang, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Zhen, Wang Shufang, Jiao Yitang, Duan Xipeng, Gu Zhengding, Hong Lanyou, Wang Maogong, Yu Feipeng, and others.

At 9:00 AM, music was played and the ceremony commenced. Chairman Wu Jingheng took his place and led everyone in performing the formal rites according to protocol. He also respectfully presented a wreath and led a three-minute moment of silence. Wu then delivered an impromptu report lasting approximately twenty minutes. The original text of Wu’s speech follows:

"Fellow comrades, today is the day the Republic of China lost its creator, the day our Party lost its mentor. Recalling this day twelve years ago, it was the most tragic day. We remember that morning as if it were today. Many people, pale with grief, gathered in the main hall of Tieshizi Hutong. We looked at each other, unable to utter a single word. Thinking of that scene, what can we say today? However, on that day, we accepted the will, instructing us that the revolution had not yet succeeded and that all comrades must continue to work hard. So, on this day, when we think of what was entrusted to us in the will, not to mention the question of thorough implementation, but even in terms of following, how well have we followed? Speaking of hard work, can it be considered continuous? These are not easy questions to answer. How then should we not feel as if we have thorns in our backs, and while feeling sorrow, also awaken our conscience to warn each other? When the Premier spoke of 'all my comrades,' this 'all' includes all the comrades I mentioned above. The most important meaning of this entrustment to all comrades, I think, has two layers.

The first meaning is that since the Premier has passed away, there will never be another who can match him. Although there may be many in our comrades who are later to know and feel, or even some who are earlier to know and feel, even if ten of them are combined, they will only be comparable to one of him, or perhaps it takes a hundred to match one of him, while those of us who are unaware, even if we combine a thousand or ten thousand, cannot compare to one of him. However, even if ten can compare to one of him, it is still not as good as his complete self. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the ten who can compare to one, the thousand or ten thousand who can compare to one, even those who cannot compare to one, just as to build Mount Tai, one must not allow a single speck of soil to be lost, and to build the rivers and seas, one must not lose a single drop of water. Thus, by combining millions and millions, we can truly continue his efforts, no different from his own effort, and what he wanted to achieve can truly be achieved for him. Based on this meaning, today, all of you who are first to know and feel, thinking of the scene twelve years ago, are already too saddened to speak. Thus, I, who am unaware, dare to say a few words to remind us and express a bit of mourning, like the master of ceremonies in a mourning hall, where the host and the mourners are all silent, but the master of ceremonies is trembling and calling out in a low voice.

The second meaning is that 'all my comrades' includes even more, as long as they cherish the Republic of China and believe in the Three Principles of the People, whether within the Party or outside the Party, they are all comrades. It is necessary to unite all the comrades in the country, and this kind of effort can be considered a true effort, and the hope for thorough implementation will naturally be achieved. Thus, China's freedom and equality can truly be achieved. This hope for unity, ever since March 12th twelve years ago, when we heard the Premier's urgent call of 'all my comrades,' although everyone had some awareness, only a few paid attention at first. It was only in the past two years that both inside and outside the Party have felt that the four words 'sincere unity' are the most important keys to saving China and making it prosperous. Since the recent Xi'an Incident, it is even more like rushing straight onto the road of shared unity. When I recall the events of twelve years ago, I also relied on the small unity at that time to cope with the Premier's great passing and easily overcome the difficulties. It is gratifying that several key figures of unity at that time, after countless hardships, are still gathered together to jointly plan for greater unity. According to my personal recollection, there are naturally many, many comrades who were noteworthy in the Premier's passing, but it would be too troublesome to count them one by one. Today, among those gathered together in the great unity, who are still the center of unity, apart from Madame Soong Ching-ling, who served day and night without closing her eyes, and Mr. Sun Zhe-sheng, who collapsed and wailed in extreme grief, being the Premier's closest relatives, when the Premier was sick in the Peking Hotel, in the Xiehe Hospital, and in Tieshizi Hutong, Wang Mr. was always by his side, worried day and night, discussing medicine and also supporting the complex Party affairs in the environment, and he was relied on by everyone. To the extent that he arranged for the Premier's grand funeral and only then did he know that the authorities in Beiping wanted to show indifference, but finally had some fear, the Feng Mr. outside Zhangjiakou at that time. When the Nationalist Party was collapsing, but everyone in the country knew that there was a first batch and a travel of Whampoa, they all thought that the Premier's death was as if he had not died, and they all paid attention to Mr. Jiang. At that time, there were naturally many more powerful figures similar to Wang, Feng, and Jiang, but the number was ultimately very small. However, as long as that kind of minority is united, it can safely overcome great dangers. If we can unite the whole country and the whole Party like now, what foreign troubles cannot be resolved, and what nation cannot be revived? Wang, Feng, Jiang, and all of you who were united at that time, are all happily gathered together today. Recalling the Premier's tragic call of 'all my comrades' when he was dying, everyone must have deeply engraved it in their hearts. Let us wipe away our tears and continue to work hard to achieve thorough implementation!"

That is all for my report. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)

### Memorial Tree Planting Ceremony Held in Nanjing Yesterday for the Late Premier

Wu Dingchang Reports on Afforestation in the Capital / Chairman Lin Sen and Sun Ke and Others Deliver Speeches

[Nanjing] The memorial tree planting ceremony for the twelfth anniversary of the late Premier’s death was held in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 12th, at 2:00 PM, in the auditorium of the Mausoleum’s Legacy School. Central representatives Ju Zheng, Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government, Sun Ke, Jiang Zuobin, He Yingqin, Yu Feipeng, Wu Dingchang, Zhou Yichun, Cheng Tiangu, Ma Chaojun, Wang Gupan, Lu Chao, and representatives from various agencies, schools, and organizations, totaling approximately one thousand people, attended. Chairman Wu Dingchang presided over the ceremony, followed by a report divided into three sections: (1) Achievements of the Premier’s Memorial Forest; (2) Current status of the afforestation movement in the capital; and (3) Overview of roadside tree planting.

After Mr. Wu's speech, Ju Zheng delivered a speech, followed by Chairman Lin Sen, who delivered a speech titled "Promoting the Afforestation Movement in Commemoration of the Late Premier." It stated that the late Premier brought together the culmination of academic thought in our country, founded the Three Principles of the People, and at the same time overthrew the autocratic political system of thousands of years and created the Republic of China. The Premier, as a thinker and practitioner, surpassed any predecessor in his greatness and deserves our eternal commemoration. However, our commemoration of the late Premier cannot be merely a formality. The most important thing is to practice and implement the Premier's teachings. The central government stipulates that the anniversary of the late Premier's death each year is the Afforestation Movement Day, which is also the meaning of this.

Examining the functions of forests for new human beings, there are many. For example, first, forests can prevent natural disasters of floods and droughts; second, forests can increase the income of the national economy. However, looking at the forest situation in our country, the area of forest land and suitable forest land nationwide is approximately 440 million acres, of which the existing forest area is only more than 90 million acres, and the remaining 340 million acres of suitable forest land are completely wasted. Due to the waste of forests, two bad results occur. First, it is easy to cause floods and droughts; second, there is a lack of timber and timber by-products. Forests have great functions for human beings. At present, our country's forests are so lacking, so for the sake of revitalizing the countryside and reducing international trade surplus, and to lay the foundation for the national economy, universal afforestation is imperative.

Our annual tree planting on the anniversary of the late Premier's death is just a starting point for the afforestation movement. If we want to commemorate the late Premier forever, we should follow the Premier's teachings and promote the afforestation movement, so that every farmer in the country knows the importance of afforestation and automatically rises up to plant and protect forests, and becomes a trend, and then there will be practical results.

After Chairman Lin’s speech, Sun Ke, Jiang Zuobin and others gave speeches. At 3:30 PM, a commemorative photo was taken, announcing the end of the ceremony. Chairman Lin, other officials, and participating representatives then walked to the 12th Anniversary Memorial Forest of the Late Premier on the south side of the Jing-Tang Road to plant trees, and dispersed around 5:00 PM.

### The Actual Situation of Tuntian Cultivation in Houtao (Part 1)

— Xu Yifei

Last autumn, I stayed in Houtao, known as "Houtao is enriched despite the hundred harms of the Yellow River," for a week. I conducted an investigation into the military tuntian cultivation and social conditions there. I am now writing down what I saw and heard for readers as a reference for studying the northwest border defense issue:

The Bandit Era

Before 1932, Houtao was a den of bandits. Wang Ying, Yang Houxiao, Su Yusheng... Their bandit life was seasonal. The autumn harvest was their most active period. Whether in wheat fields or inside homes, one could encounter groups of three to five or even hundreds or thousands of bandits at any time. Their targets were coarse grains, opium poppies, livestock... but they did not kill or set fires. Every autumn, the farmers of Houtao had to be careful, not daring to let people stay in their houses at night, fearing that bandits would come, tie them up, torture them, and force them to hand over agricultural products.

Wang Ying's father, Wang Tongchun, was a pioneer in developing Houtao. Wang Tongchun was originally a blacksmith from Shunde Prefecture, Hebei Province. In 1898 during the Guangxu reign, he got into a fight in his hometown and committed a murder. With no place to go, he fled to Houtao. He saw that the soil in Houtao was similar to that in Shunde Prefecture, except that it lacked water for irrigation, which prevented plants from growing. After careful study, using lanterns as levels and ropes to measure the terrain, and after fifty or sixty days and nights of research, he decided to divert water from the Yellow River to the shore, build canals to irrigate the fields. He told the public this idea, and everyone agreed. Thus, the Yongji Canal and other eight main canals were gradually built.

At that time, the government's power had not yet reached Houtao, and all local affairs were entirely in the hands of Wang Tongchun. He was essentially the local emperor of Houtao!

After Wang Tongchun died, his descendants included three sons. The eldest was a businessman in Baotou. The second son was Wang Ying. Wang Ying was fierce and had a bad temper from a young age. He was idle, and addicted to smoking, drinking, and gambling... he knew everything. He also learned how to shoot and liked to associate with rogue friends. At that time, the lives and property of the people of Houtao were not protected, so everyone flattered him, feared him, and called him Little Tiger, Second Master Wang...

As Wang Ying grew older, he joined local thugs and lived a life of rape, looting, and plunder. He also used his stolen goods to make friends with neighboring bandits. As a result, Wang Ying's reputation grew even larger, and he had the aura of the "King of the South" in Houtao.

It was not until after 1932 that the Jin Army, due to implementing downsizing, sent Wang Jingguo's troops to Houtao to engage in tuntian cultivation under the command of Yan Xishan. At that time, Li Shengda's division was also included. When the government troops arrived, their first priority was to suppress the bandits. However, the bandits had great lurking power. They fled here and there, and became active and arrogant again when the government troops left. There was no other way but to invest capital and engage in long-term military tuntian cultivation, using a steady and solid strategy. After six or seven months of suppression, the bandits in Houtao were reduced. Wang Ying fled to Tianjin and was not heard from for several years. Unexpectedly, when the Japanese and puppet forces invaded Sui East, this guy reappeared! Before that, it was rumored that Wang Ying had died, and the people of Suiyuan Houtao were all rejoicing!

Military Reclamation Unfolds

The era of anarchy and bandits in Houtao had passed. The recent years—1932 to 1936—were the era of military tuntian cultivation in Houtao. The initial military tuntian cultivation began in the spring plowing of 1932. At that time, Yan Xishan returned to Shanxi from Dalian. Seeing that the disbandment of troops and the resettlement of the region required large sums of money, he formulated a grand plan to develop Houtao in order to provide an outlet for the disbanded officers and soldiers and to ensure the continued existence of Shanxi Province. The content of this plan was primarily tuntian cultivation, with animal husbandry as a secondary focus. A total of over 2 million yuan in expenses was stipulated, and the Sui West Reclamation Bank issued provincial public bonds to provide funds for the development of Houtao. After the plan was formulated, water conservancy and agricultural experts were invited to measure the water level and plan experimental farms. That grand plan made the mistake of "building a cart behind closed doors, not fitting the track." The tuntian cultivation project in Houtao had to start with water conservancy. The current situation was only suitable to proceed from small to large, first dredging the existing canals, cultivating land near the canals, gradually dredging the Ula River drainage canal, and building the Yellow River dam to achieve greater results with less effort.

Yan of Jin quickly changed his plan due to this setback and designated one regiment each from Wang Jingguo's and Li Shengda's divisions, and sent over 600 surplus military officers from Shanxi Province as an experimental tuntian team for Houtao. With 200,000 yuan in funding, three experimental areas were established. The central experimental area, Baichuan Fort in Linhe County, was designated as the tuntian team for the surplus military officers. The Tuntian Office was established in Baotou, with Shi Huayan as the executive officer and Chuan Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, and Li Shengda as the chief and deputy chief officers.

In 1933, Li Shengda's division was transferred, and Wang Jingguo's division supplemented the abandoned reclamation area. From then on, the task of tuntian cultivation was entirely the responsibility of Wang's division. During this period, due to the obstruction of the Middle Banner, it was difficult to purchase Mongolian grassland. At the same time, due to the increase in the number of tuntian troops, it was necessary to expand the tuntian area and to make the wasteland abandoned by fleeing households in Wuyuan and Linhe public property. In 1933, due to the expansion of the reclamation area, the surplus agricultural products after deducting troop expenses were only worth over 50,000 yuan.

In 1934, the surplus value of agricultural products was approximately 110,000 yuan. In 1935, it increased to 245,000 yuan. The surplus profits were all saved in the Tuntian Office Fund Committee, in addition to repaying the public bonds for start-up costs, as funds for future expansion of reclamation.

The tuntian troops were organized into villages by company and townships by battalion. This new village construction was more than half completed in 1935. After the establishment of the new villages, various rules were established for the reclamation area. Officers and soldiers who followed these rules could enjoy the following rights: ㊀ Officers and soldiers could live in the houses of the new village for free. ㊁ Each season's harvest, the remaining profit, officers could get 15%, soldiers could get 35% (officers refer to direct company commanders and above, soldiers take a company as the unit of distribution). ㊂ If the officers and soldiers deposit the profits into the fund, they can get interest at the end of the year, but it must be in units of one company.

Regarding the Issue of Tuntian Cultivation

One day, Mr. Guo Weifan, the director of the Wuyuan Tuntian Office, specially invited me to talk. I was a layman on the subject of tuntian cultivation. When I talked to him, I generally discussed the impact of tuntian cultivation on society. I said, "The achievements of your military tuntian cultivation over the past four years are considerable. In my opinion, military reclamation seems to benefit more from the people. For example, the Yellow River water conservancy benefited Houtao, which started with Wang Tongchun building the eight main canals. The expansion of the military reclamation area is also because there are many familiar lands left by fleeing farmers for cultivation. Now that military reclamation has been initially successful, I have heard that the local people are somewhat dissatisfied with the military tuntian cultivation..."

Guo Guangsheng said, "Our water conservancy construction and military tuntian cultivation have several benefits for local farmers. First, the Yellow River dam is built, the Ula River drainage project is completed, and the eight main canals are dredged, so the people can enjoy water conservancy with the power of the public. Second, in the military reclamation area, new villages are completed, the army can be stationed here permanently, the bandits do not dare to stay in Houtao, and farmers can live and work in peace."

I said, "Things may not always be so. For example, the military is more effective in water conservancy construction, so military reclamation can be used first. The flood season is limited. When the military uses more, there is no room for farmers to use it. The local area is peaceful due to military reclamation, and the farmers who fled will gradually return, but their previously cultivated land has been deserted and reclaimed by the military, so there is no land to plant. In my humble opinion, in terms of military reclamation, it is better not to seek accelerated results and increased harvest figures for the time being. It is more appropriate to develop people's livelihood in a balanced way, so that the interests of farmers can be consolidated first. In this way, social order can be stabilized, and farmers' livelihoods can be developed. In the future, the population of Houtao farmers will increase, and agriculture will develop. Wouldn't this be of great benefit to the national economy, people's livelihood, and border defense!"

Mr. Guo replied, "What you said is our second step in the progress plan. In the first step, we must make the new village system sound. Military tuntian cultivation must be promoted to the point where the entire tuntian troop can take on the border defense responsibility of Houtao. As for water conservancy, what the military reclamation builds belongs to our construction. It is of course difficult to be universally used and enjoyed by the people at present. Because the establishment of the Wuyuan County Water Conservancy Bureau is the key organ of the Houtao water conservancy hub, military reclamation will not conflict with farmers in water conservancy."

Then I asked about the future plan of the Houtao military reclamation. Mr. Guo's reply was very specific. He said, "We have also drafted a plan for the entire development of Houtao in the future, but we always feel that it is not in line with implementation. So, we do not talk about the plan at present, but about experimentation. Experimentation can be from small to large, and we can get the standards that should be promoted in all matters. Compared with empty plans, it is more beneficial in the progress of the business."

Completion of the Zhegui Dam Project

The day before I left, the battalion commander of Zheguiqing invited me to visit the completion ceremony of the Zhegui Dam project on the Ula River, newly built by their soldiers. The water intake and drainage dam projects at the west entrance of the Ula River are all built using indigenous methods. The dam body is woven with grass roots, and layered with clay, and the rapid flow can flow through the dam body to reduce its scouring force. The two dams and one embankment were completed in 40 days, at a cost of only 3,000 yuan, which would not be possible without military engineering methods.

During the ceremony, an old farmer served as the master of ceremonies, slaughtering a sheep at the dam entrance and worshiping the river god, so the sacrificial ceremony was set to pray for the dam to be permanently strong. After visiting the ceremony, Battalion Commander Zhong led me to visit the current situation of the new house construction and pastoral reclamation area of each company. There are many kinds of artists in the camp, civil engineers, cement workers, everything. Saws, axes, knives, and cannons are active in the hands of the soldiers. Some are pulling soil, some are building walls, and dozens of soldiers are humming and working hard with sweat on their faces. Everyone is buried in work, rushing to build the houses in the new village. The platoon leader, wearing a white cloth trousers and jacket, directs the soldiers to build the foundation and raise the beams, which is very much like a big family working together! Zhao Binzhen, the company commander of the Third Company, personally herds the cattle. His wife feeds the piglets. He is an illiterate military officer who came from the ranks. He speaks very humorously. He said, "Qin Shi Huang built the Great Wall to defend against the Huns. We are building new villages to prevent the □□ Japanese devils from robbing our land. Mr. Xu came to visit our place, probably to see if our efforts are effective against the devils..."

This vast fertile land in Houtao has been developed by the Jin-Sui authorities for four years through military tuntian cultivation, and nearly 5,000 hectares of raw wasteland have been opened up, and a rural pastoral area has been built outside the Great Wall. Taking the agricultural products of 1936 as an example, it is enough to feed a number of border defense troops. Although the current military reclamation is very developed, its surplus value can easily become stagnant funds, forming an abnormal state of capital expansion. According to my inspection results, the future of military reclamation in Houtao should pay attention to the following three points: ㊀ Pay attention to how the surplus profit funds are used in the construction of water conservancy and the expansion of new villages. Attention should be paid to the coordination of military and civilian reclamation affairs, such as the cooperative construction and equal enjoyment of water conservancy, land clearing and registration, and inclusion in the household register. ㊂ Pay attention to the preparation of national defense and the construction of transportation; because transportation in Houtao is inconvenient, food prices are very low, and at the same time, there are no national defense works built on the wilderness. The Sui situation is urgent, and the Japanese and puppet's westward invasion will make a comeback sooner or later. Houtao is the cornerstone of northwest national defense. If we do not prepare early and strengthen border defenses, it will be too late to take measures!

### A Word to the Japanese Economic Survey Mission

— Ren

The Sino-Japanese Trade Association will hold its first general meeting in Shanghai on the 18th of this month. The Japanese representative, Mr. Kodama, and his party are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. In addition to expressing our welcome to these friends from a distant country, there are several points that we must share. These are listed below.

The tense relationship between China and Japan has now lasted for seven years. During these seven years, political conflicts between the two countries have emerged one after another. Economic frictions between the two countries have never ceased. The deterioration of emotional ties between the two countries has increased daily. These phenomena pose significant obstacles and threats to Sino-Japanese friendship and Far Eastern peace. Unfortunately, these obstacles cannot be removed in a day, so the relationship between China and Japan cannot be adjusted in a day. The removal of these obstacles depends on the calm and objective consideration of people from all walks of life in both countries, putting themselves in each other's shoes, reviewing the unfortunate events of the past, and asking who caused them. Otherwise, even if the calls for adjustment are high and the atmosphere of improvement is strong, the fundamental obstacles will not be removed, and I am afraid that it will ultimately be of no avail.

What, then, are these fundamental obstacles? In the past, Japanese people often attributed the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations to China's anti-Japanese sentiment. This is, in fact, putting the cart before the horse. The staged performance of strange dramas such as the puppet state of Manchuria and the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei were all created by Japan. The Chinese people are not wood or stone. It is only natural that they have extremely negative impressions of Japan. If Japanese people from all walks of life can put themselves in each other's shoes, they should be able to deeply understand the fundamental obstacles in the diplomatic relations between the two countries. The elimination of these fundamental obstacles requires the efforts of the people of both countries. As for the current events, we also deeply hope that this survey mission will fully recognize them. In abstract terms, Japan must respect China's sovereignty and the tranquility of its political, economic, and social affairs in the future. In concrete terms, the Japanese government should immediately ban smuggling in North China, abolish the establishment of special service agencies, and strictly prohibit the secret smuggling of drugs.

In recent years, smuggling in North China has been rampant. We know very well that the smugglers are all scoundrels. However, the Japanese government turns a blind eye to these smuggling scoundrels. It even created the name "special trade" and indulged them. As a result, the scoundrels have become even more brazen, interfering with customs enforcement, destroying customs houses, and assaulting officials. This phenomenon not only undermines China's tax policy, but it is also something that the Chinese people cannot tolerate. Second, in recent years, heroin and other drugs have been secretly smuggled into the interior, weakening the Chinese race and violating international morality. We have not heard of Japan taking effective measures to ban this. Third, the Japanese government should bear direct responsibility for the establishment of Japanese special service agencies in our interior. These three things are considered by the Chinese people today to be serious problems that endanger the survival of the Chinese nation. They are also important causes of the current deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, in today's efforts to adjust the relations between China and Japan and improve the psychology of the Chinese people, these three things should be resolved first. If the members of the economic survey mission can pay more attention to these three things this time and urge the Japanese government to plan for improvement after returning to China, it is what we deeply hope for.

The improvement of these three things may not be able to completely improve Sino-Japanese relations, but it will also be sufficient to help clarify the relationship between the two countries in the future. After the improvement, if the Japanese government can go a step further, open up new paths based on the principle of genuine reciprocity, in order to break the current stalemate between China and Japan and lay the foundation for peace in the Far East, then this trip by all of you will not have been in vain.

### Japanese Diet Session Likely to Be Extended

[Tokyo] With only two weeks remaining in the Diet session, only one bill passed by both houses yesterday, the Bill to Amend the Hokkaido Ten People Protection Law. The remaining seventy-five bills remain in the House of Representatives. The government authorities are working hard to promote the proceedings in both houses. At the same time, they are considering whether to extend the session. According to the government, the Diet session has to be extended for several days, but the number of days will depend on the future situation. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 12th)

The South Manchuria Railway Company's business budget for the Showa 12th fiscal year is currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Manchurian Affairs Bureau. It is scheduled to be formally approved in late March. However, Mantetsu must increase its budget again in order to implement the Five-Year Plan. Director Yagi came to Tokyo from Dalian on the 11th to meet with Director Sasaki to report the reasons for the budget increase, which include the construction of the Eastern Border Road industrial railway, the expansion of the Huludao port construction plan, the separation of the Dalian Steamship Company's dockyard department, the plan to establish a new shipyard company, and the expansion of the coal liquefaction business. The business expenses of Mantetsu in the 12th fiscal year, in addition to its paid-in capital, are all financed by corporate bonds. With this budget increase, the issuance of corporate bonds will also have to be increased. It is planned that the government will pre-emptively take all or borrow special funds from the Industrial Bank of Japan as capital. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 12th)

### Japan's Policy Toward China Still Adheres to Three Basic Principles

Declares No Abandonment of Acquired Interests Foreign Minister Sato Succumbs to the Military

Tokyo Although the new Foreign Minister Sato recently stated that the Japanese government's policy toward China will undergo significant changes, he has now clarified that his policy toward China is not much different from that of his predecessors. Last night, Sato delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, the main points of which are as follows: ㊀ He agrees with the three basic principles set by Arita when he was Foreign Minister. ㊁ He announced that even if China and Japan reopen negotiations, Japan does not want to use "Manchukuo" as a negotiating point, because "Manchukuo" has now become a reality. ㊂ He declared that Japan is determined to abide by the open-door policy in Central and Southern China, which implies that Japan does not want to abandon its special interests in North China. Last night, Sato denied that he, the Prime Minister, and the Minister of the Army had any disagreements on policy toward China, saying that he believed that there was no need to revise Japan's fundamental policy toward China. What he wants to explore is merely the means to implement this policy. In order to preserve Japan's most important interests, he intends to freely and frankly exchange views with the Chinese government, clarify China's disputes, and Japan's demands. He wants to negotiate with China, and at the same time, he intends to make China aware that this is Japan's minimum demand, and there can be no more concessions.

Sato continued to mention the so-called crisis in Japan, saying that all countries in the world are now encountering tense international relations, and Japan cannot be excluded. Moreover, eliminating this crisis is not difficult. The real crisis is war. This depends on Japan's mental response. He firmly believes that Japan can avoid this kind of crisis at any time as it wishes, and it can also cause it at any time as it wishes.

According to reports, the Foreign Minister's speech has aroused criticism from several sides. Councillor Okura of the House of Peers has declared that he intends to question the Foreign Minister on this point. The National Alliance and the Oriental Society, minority parties, have also said that they will question the Foreign Minister's speech when the House of Representatives meets tomorrow. However, the majority parties, the Minseitō and the Seiyūkai, are determined not to take this action. Government circles have declared that they do not want to see the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister announce conflicting views on policy toward China. According to reports, when the Prime Minister replied to Councilor Ozaki's question in the House of Representatives on February 17, he said that the situation between "Manchukuo" and its neighboring countries was tense, and that if there was a fuse, it could explode at any time. The Prime Minister was only discussing the local situation at that time and made this statement with "Manchukuo" as the center. Yesterday's Foreign Minister's speech involved the general international situation, and the situation is different. This afternoon, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Minister of the Army, and the Minister of the Navy held a joint meeting. It is said that it has been decided that the opinions of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister do not conflict with each other. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 12th)

### Debates on Foreign Policy at the Plenary Session of Your Esteemed Parliament Budget Committee

Supplementary Explanation by Sato

Baron Okura Koshi, a member of the Tokyo Koseikai, stated at the plenary session of the House of Peers Budget Committee this afternoon that there was a considerable discrepancy between Prime Minister Hayashi's foreign policy address to the Diet in his capacity as concurrent Foreign Minister and Foreign Minister Sato's stated foreign policy. After Prime Minister Hayashi and Foreign Minister Sato attended, questions were raised, to which Prime Minister Hayashi and Foreign Minister Sato replied as follows.

Foreign Minister Sato's reply: I answered the questions raised by Messrs. Tsurumi and Ashida in the House of Representatives yesterday. Today, Baron Okura raises questions. My wording yesterday was somewhat inadequate and seemed likely to cause misunderstandings. Now that I have been asked, I will add further explanations to supplement what was lacking. I will answer in detail below:

㊀ Regarding Japan's intentions: The statement that "a crisis can be avoided at any time" refers to the need to be cautious in adopting a proactive, war-inducing attitude. It does not mean that we should endure even if the other party provokes us. The word "crisis" as used yesterday refers to the pressure of international relations. If interpreted in this sense, Japan has been on the verge of a crisis since the Manchurian Incident, as I stated in my reply yesterday. As for the Prime Minister's statement that the situation is on the verge of explosion, centered on "Manchukuo," there is no contradiction between them. We must, of course, complete our national defense to prepare for this kind of crisis.

㊁ Regarding diplomacy towards China, the statement that "there is no other way but to be patient until the other country changes its attitude" refers to the attitude of mutually basing things on international justice. As for attitudes such as the other side trampling on international justice or damaging our national image, these are entirely different matters.

㊂ Regarding economic groupings in Manchuria and elsewhere, the statement that "it is not yet the time to create an exclusionary group in the Orient involving Japan, Manchuria, China, and other countries" naturally does not deny the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria, and we intend to strive to further strengthen it.

㊃ As for the statement "Can't we step onto a grand and open road with a dignified attitude?", this is not a criticism of past attitudes, but simply a frank expression of the attitude that the Foreign Minister himself should adopt. (Domei News Agency, 12th)

### Domestic Reaction to Sato's Speech

Right-Wingers Rise Up in Criticism

Foreign Minister Sato's reply in the House of Representatives yesterday (11th), when compared with Sato's speech in the House of Peers on the 8th of this month, is clearer and more straightforward in several respects. However, some points clearly change the meaning of his previous speech. Sato's statement that he cannot change the policy towards China that was elucidated by the previous cabinet shows that he is unable to uphold his own beliefs and is gradually leaning towards compromise. However, Sato's statement on the international crisis demonstrates his boldness and far-sightedness, and it is commendable that he dares to say what others do not. Sato believes that the current deadlock in Japanese diplomacy is entirely due to the failure of Japan's policies towards China to date, and that changing Japan's international environment must begin with improving Sino-Japanese relations. This is Sato's basic creed, and it can be said to be penetrating. However, if Sato's fundamental policy towards China is the same as that of the previous cabinet, how can the goal of improvement be achieved? As for Sato's surprising statement that if the crisis that Japan speaks of only means international tension, then we should know that the situation in other countries is even more worrying than in Japan, so there is no need for the Japanese people to be alarmed. If the crisis refers to war, they should know that if Japan wants war, war will come immediately, and if it wants to avoid war, war can be avoided. Also, Sato's statement that today's Japan, built through seven years of effort, has not yet adopted a dignified attitude and moved towards a smooth and open road is perplexing, and has aroused great praise. When Sato clarified his fundamental attitude, saying that Japan should abandon its traditional notions of petty tactics and move towards the international highway, the people would have a full understanding of foreign policy, and foreign countries would not be suspicious of Japan, and a unified foreign policy could be realized. Although Sato's theory is abstract, today there are criticisms of Sato's view of the international crisis, which is in opposition to the views of Prime Minister Hayashi and the Army. Therefore, Prime Minister Hayashi convened a special meeting today with Army Minister Sugiyama Gen, Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa, and Foreign Minister Sato Naotake to discuss ways to clarify misunderstandings and decided that Sato would make a supplementary explanation at the plenary session of the House of Peers Budget Committee this afternoon (12th) and at the general meeting of the House of Representatives tomorrow (13th). The National League, one of the extreme right-wing groups in the Diet, criticized Sato, especially mentioning the equal treatment of China, which implies that Japan has treated China unequally in the past, and declared that concessions to China are inappropriate. The National League also expressed dissatisfaction with Sato's statement that Japan should adopt a dignified attitude, pointing out that this is tantamount to directly admitting Japan's past unfairness. The National League has decided to raise tough questions to Sato in the Diet. Nakano Seigo, president of the Eastern Society, an extreme right-wing group in the House of Representatives, visited Prime Minister Hayashi this afternoon to protest against Sato's lack of awareness of the current situation. Also, the local newspapers today prominently carried a message saying that middle-ranking army officers believe that Sato's view of the extraordinary situation is fundamentally wrong, and therefore political turmoil is brewing.

Tokyo: One section of Foreign Minister Sato's response in the House of Representatives on the 11th, when compared to Prime Minister Hayashi's response to Ozaki Yukio on February 18th, leads people to believe that the two have different understandings of the international situation. Therefore, the government paid special attention to this point. After the adjournment of the House of Representatives on the evening of the 11th, Chief Secretary Ohashi met with Foreign Vice Minister Hotta to hear the Foreign Minister's true intentions and investigate the verbatim records of the two ministers' responses. Prime Minister Hayashi, Foreign Minister Sato, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai also decided to exchange opinions before the opening of the House of Peers Budget Committee meeting on the morning of the 12th to consider future countermeasures. According to the government's opinion, there is no difference in understanding of the situation between the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. The Prime Minister explained the current situation in "Manchukuo," while the Foreign Minister only briefly stated the general theory of diplomatic principles. Only the Foreign Minister's failure to mention his views on strengthening national defense led people to be confused by the impression of general theory and reality. Therefore, the issue of the two ministers' understanding of the situation is not a problem. (Domei News Agency, 12th)

### Sato's Speech on Diplomacy Toward China

Six Points Worth Noting

Word Count: 745

Tokyo: The following points regarding China in Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's speech in the House of Representatives yesterday (11th) are particularly noteworthy: ㊀ Regarding the organization of the Japan-Manchuria group, Sato believes that it is extremely doubtful whether this organization should be carried out based on the current situation. The organization of the group can only be carried out in times of emergency. There are still many tasks in Manchuria that remain for Japan to carry out. These tasks have not yet been successful, so it is too early to talk about the organization of the group at this time. ㊁ Regarding the Manchuria issue, Sato said that "Manchukuo" has become a firm and existing fact. Japan has a close relationship with Manchuria in history, so Japan will definitely raise the Manchuria issue when negotiating with China in the future. Japan is currently considering the rights and interests in the area bordering Manchuria and the measures to guarantee these rights and interests. It is also considering whether these issues should be discussed with China. ㊂ Regarding the issue of assisting China, Sato said that there is no problem in providing moral assistance to China's efforts for unification and revival. Japan should not only express deep sympathy, but also provide assistance within the scope possible. ㊃ Regarding the fundamental policy toward China, Sato believes that there is no need to make any changes. The principles of the foreign policy explained by the previous cabinet only represent the goals that Japan should strive to achieve. However, there are various different routes to achieve these goals, and these routes are what he emphasizes. In other words, he feels that the methods adopted so far need to be re-examined. Sato denies that there are differences of opinion between him and Prime Minister Hayashi and Army Minister Sugiyama. ㊄ Regarding egalitarianism, Sato agrees with the opinions of the questioners, that upholding egalitarianism may cause a bad reaction from China. However, Sato reiterated that it is extremely necessary to create a foundation or a good atmosphere in order to break the deadlock that Sino-Japanese relations have fallen into. He continued that if Japan's policy is extremely just, then even if we announce to the world and say that China's minimum demands for negotiation are to protect Japan's rights and interests, there is no need to hesitate. It is not unreasonable for us to strongly insist on our minimum demands. If negotiations still have difficulties following this method, then we can only wait for the other party to change its attitude and there is no other way to follow. The above words are extremely important, and their implications are worthy of our careful study. ㊅ Regarding the adjustment of relations between Britain and China, Sato said that Japan still adheres to the open-door policy in China, Central China, and South China, and has decided to respect China's national sovereignty throughout. This point is also extremely important because the so-called open-door policy has not been mentioned in North China. (Central News Agency, 12th)

### British Newspaper Commentary

Bright Spot Appears in Improving International Relations

[London] After Japanese Foreign Minister Sato gave a foreign policy speech in the House of Peers of that country a few days ago, The Times published an editorial commenting on it, stating that "Foreign Minister Sato clearly explained his diplomatic beliefs. He said, 'If Japan's policies toward China cause other countries with interests in China to be fearful, this is not a good strategy.' Only goodwill can be shown to those who hear this tone. The actions of the Japanese in northern China have caused deep unease among British people and this is still the case. Now that Foreign Minister Sato has made a statement to dispel this, all British people who are friendly with Japan will naturally feel satisfied. The open-door policy implemented by "Manchukuo" is nothing less than a closed door to foreign merchants. If the Chinese government deals with Japan's many demands with only a passive diplomatic approach, the result may cause internal disputes, and will they not make other plans in the long run? Fortunately, the situation may change after Sato's speech. All of our countrymen who share with the leaders of all sectors in Japan the desire to increase and strengthen friendship between the two countries have expressed goodwill for this reason. Japanese foreign policy is now controlled by moderates. There are several signs of this. For example, Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro was originally a soldier, but the speech he gave in the country's parliament was not in the tone of a militarist. His references to the relationship between Britain and Japan also show sincerity in increasing friendly relations. As for Foreign Minister Sato, he boldly admitted past mistakes. All of these things make us criticize Japan's current administrative system. To put it bluntly, the country's diplomatic authorities have failed to compete with the powerful military and are instead mostly controlled by the military. Although the arrogance of the Japanese military has waned slightly, it may regain the upper hand in the future. Therefore, China's concerns cannot be dispelled for the time being. However, it can still be asserted that Foreign Minister Sato's speech and the debates in the Japanese House of Representatives yesterday are still a bright spot in international relations."

### British Naval Minister Announces This Year's Shipbuilding Program

148 Ships to Begin Construction Within the Year, Naval Budget Passed by House of Commons

[London] The House of Commons discussed the naval budget this afternoon and passed it by a vote of 152 to 57. (The total naval budget for 1937 amounts to £105,065,000, an increase of £23,776,000 over 1936.) (Central News Agency, 12th, Havas)

[London] Today, Sir Hoare, the First Lord of the Admiralty, presented the naval estimates to the House of Commons, giving a moving account of the government's efforts to reorganize the navy. Hoare said that due to the lack of action in the past few years, it is now necessary to accelerate the ordinary ten-year plan in two or three years. What is now requested of Parliament is the approval of naval expenditures of £100 million and the construction program for 80 new ships. Hoare continued that this construction program would mean that the total number of warships under construction at the end of this year would reach 148, including 5 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, and 17 cruisers. All naval personnel are well aware that this construction cannot be delayed any longer.

Hoare's speech today was largely in response to the following questions: ㊀ Are the British fleets now being built suitable for the new environment? ㊁ What naval policy is the construction program based on? ㊂ What is the future of the naval arms race?

Regarding the first point, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that the British Navy and fleet personnel are constantly studying the lessons of past wars and keeping up with the changes of the times. Various experiments of all sizes are being carried out, such as the blasting power of explosives and the strength of various parts of metal. Therefore, the construction of warships in the future will be based on the results of various problem studies over the past 18 years, and will never follow the old format or imitate the models of other countries. The drawings of each ship will be based on the experience of war and the results of experiments. For battleships, for example, there were 18 different drawings before the style of these five ships was finalized. After testing from all sides, the final decision was made.

The First Lord of the Admiralty continued that the fleet needed in the future should pay considerable attention to four issues: ㊀ The danger of air force attacks; ㊁ The safety of bases; ㊂ Keeping transportation uninterrupted, especially in narrow seas; ㊃ Striking ability. Hoare said that at the beginning of the previous European war, the British Navy was virtually unprepared for the new offensive weapons, but today there are 17 years to develop the counterattack force. The Navy also has its own air force power, and the greatness and accuracy of anti-aircraft weapons are beyond what could have been dreamed of before 1918. Therefore, enemy air forces cannot easily regard today's fleet or main battleships as an easy target.

As for the safety of the base, after the examination by the army, navy, and air force, because the protection work of the naval base still belongs to the air force and army for the most part, it is enough to show that the base is strong and unbreakable, regardless of whether the fleet is stationed there.

As for maritime commercial traffic, especially in narrow seas, because attacks on the water surface are still the greatest danger, the number of warships must also be sufficiently large to fulfill its responsibility to protect commercial traffic. The air force is also paying close attention to this issue. Of course, the detailed plan is not to be revealed now, but when necessary, the British Navy will be able to cope with it with ease. Hoare also said that a representative committee has been formed between the naval and commercial departments and the shipping industry to study and plan response strategies to prevent the interruption of overseas commercial traffic. The First Lord of the Admiralty then said that today's national defense policy must still be a brave offensive. Attack is by no means the sole control of the enemy. Hoare, in his statement of various international changes since 1914, again stated that while there are many situations that are not as good as they used to be, there is also one thing that is somewhat satisfactory, that is, there is no hostility or competition between Britain and the United States, and according to the Anglo-German naval agreement, it has been decided not to compete in naval armaments. Hoare said that the 1936 Naval Treaty is often not taken seriously by the world, but this treaty has established clear restrictions on qualitative competition, so it is hoped that the maritime powers can join more, so that the United Kingdom can also approve the treaty.

Hoare said that he does not intend to use countries or numbers as the target to clearly indicate the standards that the British naval power should have, but he dares to say that in order to maintain the safety of the imperial commercial routes, it is essential to have a strong fleet to provide comprehensive protection for commercial traffic in the eastern and western hemispheres.

Hoare said that the naval base in Singapore will be completed in the next two or three months, and said that the purpose of increasing British naval power is equally important in terms of national self-defense or collective security under the Covenant of the League of Nations, so criticisms of the naval construction program are mostly aimed at shortcomings, rather than dissatisfaction with excesses, but in this rapidly changing environment, the construction program must be flexible, that is, even with the expansion planned now, both the intelligent and practical aspects have been taken into account.

In terms of battleships, five will begin construction in 1937, because the existing fifteen battleships, twelve of which are over twenty years old, would otherwise leave Britain behind if the great powers had built warships for years. These new battleships are approximately 25,000 tons and are equipped with 14-inch guns, and their speed is superior to that of existing ships. As for cruisers, after the completion of seven new cruisers this year, Britain will have 53 cruisers that are not overage and 23 cruisers that are overage. As for cruisers that are overage, they will not be abandoned for the time being, but will be equipped with anti-aircraft guns for use in protecting narrow seas.

Hoare's conclusion described in detail the future of the naval arms race. He asked whether countries would start a new competition in the future, ultimately exhausting themselves or causing a final war and mutual destruction. Hoare said that he did not believe the world would fall into this kind of end because there are considerable possibilities for limiting armaments in the naval field. In the past there was the Washington Treaty, but it was not renewed. More recently, there was the 1930 London Treaty, the Anglo-German Agreement, and the Submarine Warfare Treaty, etc. The 1936 London Treaty has great hope of being accepted by the powers, and the United Kingdom is preparing to approve it, and is currently in contact with various countries.

The main effort of the British government is to conclude bilateral agreements with Germany and the Soviet Union, but similar negotiations are also proceeding smoothly with Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Turkey, and other countries. Italy has also agreed to accept the 14-inch heavy gun as the highest limit for the battleship gun position, but on the condition that other powers also accept it. Hoare also hopes that Italy can fully join the naval agreement after jointly speaking in the Mediterranean.

Hoare finally asked the House to not underestimate the 1936 Naval Treaty, and he is confident that the treaty has a very broad future. What he regrets is that the treaty does not have direct provisions on quantitative restrictions, but if the treaty is generally implemented in various countries in the future, then the naval arms race, whether in the qualitative or quantitative aspects, can be avoided based on past experience. Qualitative competition is more costly than quantity, and the damage to friendship is even greater. The 1936 Naval Treaty can enable countries to avoid competition in terms of type and size. He feels that the future is not entirely hopeless. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters)

### British Army Expansion Aims at Defense

Minister of Public Works Answers Question from Labor Party Member

[London] The House of Lords recently passed the National Defense Temporary Expenditure Bill (i.e., the bill on issuing national defense bonds for £400 million) at second reading using parliamentary procedures. During the debate, Lord Stanhope, Minister of Public Works, replied to the question from Labor Party member Lord Strabolgi on behalf of the government, saying that "the government has no intention of making the British Army an army of a continental country. Our intention is only to send troops to overseas territories of the Empire, to guarantee the safety of the coastal headquarters, to organize air defense affairs in our country, and to enable our army to organize expeditions to any location when necessary. The military strength we currently have and the military strength we want to have is only that much." (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas)

### Rumors That Austria Will Change Its Foreign Policy

Seeking Closer Ties with Hungary and Czechoslovakia, Berlin Feels Uneasy

[Berlin] It is rumored that Austrian foreign policy will change its course and seek closer ties with Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt will also visit Britain and France in the near future. German political figures are quite uneasy about these rumors. The Berlin Daily recently published an article stating, "This kind of dramatic change in foreign policy is only a temporary dream of the Czech government. Based on the restraints Austria has taken in recent years, it is difficult to make this a reality." (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas)

### Western Rebel Army Besieges Madrid Amid Wind and Snow

Italian Blackshirts Join the Battle; Government Troops Launch Counteroffensive on the Northeastern Front

Salamanca: The Nationalist army's major siege of Madrid is currently being carried out with great effort amidst strong winds, snow, and severe cold in order to achieve its completion. Yesterday, the Nationalist army occupied the town of Torrelaguna in Valencia and surrounding villages, and now the fall of the crucial city of Guadalajara is only a matter of time. Madrid currently relies entirely on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea for the supply of food and ammunition. Once surrounded on all sides and the supply routes cut off, this isolated city with its starving army will have no choice but to engage in a final desperate struggle, breaking through to reach the coast, or it will face certain death. The Nationalist army does not want the war to extend into the streets of Madrid but will remain outside the city gates, waiting for the defending troops to surrender due to lack of supplies. Nationalist army officers believe that their troops, being mechanized and equipped with superior armaments, will be able to defeat General Miaja, the supreme commander of the government forces, in a major battle outside the capital. The battle of Torrelaguna was the most intense engagement since the outbreak of the civil war. A battalion of troops led by the famous "Red Lion" was almost completely wiped out. After capturing the town, the Nationalist army immediately dispatched two columns, one to the northwest, hoping to join forces with their comrades in the Sierra de Guadarrama, and the other to the south, hoping to unite with their comrades in Toledo. Once the town of Almunia falls, the only remaining transportation route between Madrid and Valencia will be the secondary road south of Alcalá de Henares. Therefore, the Nationalist army will advance southwest from Almunia to cut off that road and join forces with the Nationalist army in the Toledo region, thereby completing the siege of Madrid, and the Nationalist army can wait quietly for its fall. Meanwhile, government troops launched a vigorous counteroffensive last night against the Nationalist army's forward positions on the high ground between Torrelaguna and Valtierra, using artillery bombardment and aircraft support. It is claimed that they have recovered some lost territory and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. According to government authorities, the Guadalajara front currently has several divisions of Italian Blackshirts and one division of regular troops, led by Italian generals, assisting in the battle, with General Mancini as the supreme commander of the entire army. Therefore, General Miaja said, "This is a regular European war. We are now engaged in a clear battle against Italy." (Reuters, Central News Agency, 12th)

Madrid: The Ministry of Military Affairs announced today that government troops had captured 41 Italian volunteers on the Guadalajara front and allowed foreign journalists to speak with them. It is understood that there are currently three divisions of Italian troops, totaling 21,000 men, on the Guadalajara front, each division consisting of two or three brigades, each brigade consisting of three regiments, and each regiment consisting of 600 men. They all arrived in Spain aboard the transport ship "Lombardia" escorted by a warship. Among the captured Italians were three officers, one of whom said, "We are all non-Fascist party members. We thought we were going to Abyssinia." (National Telegraph, 11th)

### Belgian Security Guarantee Issue

Italy, England and France take the same position.

Brussels: Responsible officials recently announced that the Belgian government had recently sent a note to the British government regarding the future Western European Pact (referring to the new Locarno Pact issue), stating that Germany, following England and France, had already accepted Belgium as a guaranteed country in the future Western European Pact without assuming any guarantee obligations. The contents of this note have been sent to the Italian government by Belgium, and Italy has already notified Belgium that regarding the issue of guaranteeing Belgium's security, Italy is adopting the same attitude as England and France.

### National Socialist Party Recruiting Troops in the United States

German Newspapers Launch Anti-American Propaganda; U.S. Government Protests

[Washington] Congressman Dickstein, Chairman of the House Rules Committee, spoke in the House today in support of a proposal to investigate anti-American propaganda in the country, stating that the National Socialist Party plans to organize an army in the United States and has already recruited 200,000 people, which could increase to one million before the end of the year. German Americans are being intimidated; if they do not sign a notice to join the German army, their families or assets in Germany will be retaliated against. Therefore, German Americans are in a dilemma and are extremely angry. Currently, there are a large number of spies in the United States who are trying to create a Fascist government. He could name no fewer than 100 of them. A chemist from a well-known automobile company is the leader of the National Socialist Party in the United States. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 11th)

### A Martial Arts Drama in the Belgian Senate

Dispute Arises During Discussion of By-Elections; Fascist Party Member Throws a Punch

Brussels: Today, during a discussion in the Senate regarding a bill on by-elections, senators suddenly began fighting each other, lasting for several minutes. This necessitated a temporary recess. It was discovered that the cause of the dispute was the repeated obstruction of the proceedings by members of the Fascist Rexist Party. After the government spokesman reported the results of the review of the bill, the party members became even more vociferous. Grenna, a Rexist Party member, punched and struck Catto, a Liberal Party member, in the face, leading to great disorder. The ushers were unable to maintain order, and the speaker announced a recess. The meeting resumed shortly thereafter, and Liberal Party members withdrew some of their remarks. The Rexist Party member Grenna also apologized to the assembly. As for the clause in this bill stipulating that "the vacancy of a retired senator shall not be filled unless the retired senator retired due to unavoidable circumstances," it was ultimately passed by a vote of 114 to 16.

### Puppet Organizations Attempt to Dump Goods in Fujian

Japanese and Taiwanese Living in Amoy Form Company to Undertake Sales; Ye Qinghe Negotiates Twice in Tianjin

Amoy Correspondence: The Colonial Bureau of the puppet "Manchukuo" dispatched a senior official, Yang Song, a Taiwanese, to Amoy in January to investigate the market and negotiate the sale of soybean cakes, flour, cement, and other products from Northeast China. He contacted Japanese and Taiwanese residing in Amoy, asking them to organize a large-scale sales company, planning to transport large quantities of goods from Northeast China to Amoy for dumping in the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou prefectures of southern Fujian. Initially, a certain shipping company owner contacted him, but negotiations broke down due to unsatisfactory terms. Subsequently, Chen Changfu, a Taiwanese, and Ye Qinghe, a well-known opium king who recently became a naturalized Japanese citizen, negotiated with Yang to form a "South China Trading Company" to undertake the sales. Yang agreed and then went to Shantou and Guangzhou to investigate the market and find ways to promote sales. Ye has also personally traveled to Tianjin twice to negotiate, and the matter has matured and can be realized soon. It is said that the internal organization of the company is also in place, and soon various goods from Northeast China will be shipped to Amoy for dumping. The business community in Amoy, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou is paying close attention to this matter, and its impact will not be small.

It has been found that Chen Changfu is the president of the Taiwanese Residents Association, and Ye Qinghe is a well-known domestic and international opium king who committed a red pill manufacturing case in Shanghai and was wanted by the court. He fled back to Amoy, changed his name to Zhensheng, and reported to the authorities that Qinghe had died. He is now using the name Zhensheng to run the Yumin Company, undertaking the sales of special goods from the entire province of Fujian. Society and newspapers still refer to him as Ye Qinghe, and Ye continues to live as before. He travels between the province and Amoy, acting like a buffoon. He also occasionally goes to Shanghai. Last winter, under the name Zhensheng, he applied for Japanese citizenship and obtained the qualifications of a Japanese citizen. A certain faction's secret activities in southern Fujian have repeatedly failed. Recently, they have created the so-called "Southern Fujian National Salvation Association" and entrusted Ye with its leadership. Ye, as a recent naturalized citizen, is also very eager to show his courage. His two trips to Tianjin were also related to this matter, not solely for the purpose of promoting the sale of goods from Northeast China. On February 27, the Taikoo Suiyang ship arrived in Amoy from Hong Kong. The police局 cracked down on a large shipment of military equipment at the Taikoo wharf, the quantity of which is unknown, including four light machine guns, with a total value of over 4,000 yuan. The police局 secretly kept the matter quiet, and only three days later did the news spread that on the 6th of this month, the Suiyang returned to Amoy from Shanghai, and the police局 arrested a Chinese crew member from the ship, who was the wanted criminal transporting the weapons. It is rumored that the owner of the goods is a member of a certain faction and planned to transport them to the inland "i.e., related to the so-called" Southern Fujian National Salvation Association.

### Taiwanese Establish Debt Collection Company in Amoy

So-called Trust Business Is Like This; Authorities Negotiate with Japanese Consulate to Ban It

Amoy Correspondence: A certain nationality citizen residing in Amoy, because of their consular jurisdiction and special relationships, are not subject to the sanctions of our country's laws and administrative punishments, and often engage in illegal and improper acts, creating disturbances as they please. Recently, they have had even more outlandish ideas. These nationality citizens have actually colluded with unscrupulous Chinese to establish a trust company on Dazhong Road. Among its business activities, one item is to undertake debt collection for others. Recently, they were entrusted by someone to collect a debt from Mr. Wu, an employee of the Public Education Center, and coerced Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu reported the matter to the police局. Wu Tingzhen, the captain of the police局's detective team, dispatched detectives to investigate and learned that the principals of the company were Taiwanese of Japanese nationality, Mr. Lin and Mr. Li, who were taking in many unemployed Taiwanese and Chinese, and employing lawyer Dai as their legal advisor. The method of undertaking debt collection is that the creditor first signs a contract with the company, stipulating that if the principal and interest are recovered in the future, a certain percentage will be deducted by the company, and all expenses will be borne by the creditor. If legal action is required, the lawyer's fees will be borne by the company. It is rumored that the authorities have already negotiated with the Japanese consul in Amoy to ban this, but there has been no result yet. The detective team is also paying attention to arresting those who are undertaking debt collection and investigating them strictly. According to Amoy's poor economic situation in recent years, there are many businesses and individuals with heavy debts. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for many to repay their debts immediately, and even if they are forced to pay, they cannot afford it. Now, the sudden appearance of this special force to undertake debt collection and forcible extortion will inevitably lead to many disputes and cause social unrest. (March 10)

### Joint Exhibition of Special Products from Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces

Opening Ceremony Held in Guangzhou on the 7th; Exhibition to Continue in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi

Guangzhou Correspondence: The Joint Exhibition of Special Products from Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces, originally scheduled to be held in Guangdong on January 10, 1937, was postponed to March 7 due to insufficient preparation time. The exhibition is of a mobile nature. After closing in Guangdong, it is scheduled to be exhibited in Changsha, Wuchang, and Nanchang in turn. The purpose is to promote the inter-provincial sales of special products from the four provinces and revitalize domestic goods. Guangdong Province began preparations last year, with the Construction Department organizing a preparatory committee to be responsible for the construction of the exhibition site and the arrangement of exhibits. The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce was responsible for collecting products from Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan. When special products from the provinces were transported to Guangdong, transportation by ship and train received special preferential treatment in freight rates. Since the collection began, a total of 233 manufacturers and businesses from the four provinces have been identified, with more than 1,700 kinds of products and a total of more than 10,100 pieces. After January of this year, products from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi were successively transported to Guangdong by the Yuehan Railway, and the conference opened on March 7.

The conference venue is located in the East School Ground in Guangzhou, located behind the Guangdong Provincial Public Sports Ground, with a vast area. There are security teams and military police sheds on both sides of the site, who are permanently responsible for protection. Fire brigades are also stationed there to prevent unforeseen circumstances. There is a food market in front of the venue. In front of the main entrance of the conference, there is a paifang (ornamental gate) with a portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen hanging on it. There is also a towering paifang on the avenue in front of the conference, with a white cloth banner with the words "Joint Exhibition of Special Products from Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces" written in black. At the western end of the large paifang is the ticket office for the conference, with each ticket costing half a jiao. Next to it is the joint office of the representatives of the four provinces. This is the external appearance of the venue. The content of the venue is divided into four provincial exhibition halls, each in the form of a cloister, surrounding the entire site. To the left of the entrance is the Hubei Exhibition Hall, followed by the Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong Exhibition Halls. The Guangdong Pavilion is located on the far right. Enclosed within the four provincial exhibition halls is a circular space, which is the sales area for goods from the four provinces, divided into approximately 400 booths, with each province occupying approximately 100 booths. The order is also divided according to Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. Outside the exhibition halls are entertainment venues such as theaters, storytelling stages, chess tables, and dance floors.

At 10:00 a.m. on the 7th, the opening ceremony was held. Prior to this, the preparatory committee of the conference, representatives from various provinces, and military and political officials from Guangdong, as well as representatives from all walks of life, arrived one after another. The following were publicly nominated as members of the presidium: Peng Chao and Peng Youxian from Hunan, Wu Baodao and Wu Chun from Hubei, Chen Yongcang and He Jicang from Jiangxi, Lin J眉mei, Liao Langru, and Zou Dianbang from Guangdong, and Liu Weichi, the director of the conference office representing Tang Chengbo, and Cen Xuelv representing the Guangdong Provincial Government. Cen Xuelv was elected as the chairman of the presidium. Several hundred representatives from all walks of life attended the ceremony. First, Chairman Cen delivered an opening speech, stating the significance of the conference. Next, representatives from the Military Affairs Committee and the Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office delivered speeches in succession. The director of the conference office reported on the preparations for the conference. Representatives from the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce delivered speeches in succession. Then, the chairman of the conference and the representatives made a tour of the entire venue, and Cen Xuelv performed the ribbon-cutting and unveiling ceremony. After the ribbon-cutting, the conference was opened to the public, and people from all walks of life entered the venue to visit, numbering approximately several thousand people at one time. Among the representatives from various provinces who came to Guangdong to visit were Zhang Fankun, the secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Government, and Wang Jianwu, representing Long Xuesui, the director of the Jiangxi Construction Department. The reporter visited the various exhibition halls that day. Entering the front door of the conference and turning left, the reporter first entered the Hubei Exhibition Hall. The special products of Hubei were mostly industrial raw materials, such as iron ore, gypsum, soybean cake, cotton, hemp, medicinal materials, and tea. Handicrafts included carpets, soap, Hanyang machinery, and various types of fabrics and serge produced by the Hubei Official Textile Factory. Hanzhou silk shops sold medicinal pills and medicinal liquor. Agricultural products included rice seeds and plant seeds. At the end of the Hubei Pavilion was the Yuehan Pavilion, displaying products from the Guangzhou factory of the Yuehan Railway, as well as photographs of the various factories and content of the Yuehan Railway, photographs of large-scale engineering projects along the route, and photographs of famous scenic spots along the route. There was also a model of the Yuehan Railway route, with the line symbolized by green electric tube lights, with the names of major stations listed next to it. Next was the Jiangxi Exhibition Hall. The front section displayed various minerals from Jiangxi, Wan載 ramie cloth, various types of rice seeds, and agricultural products. Most of the rest of the hall displayed porcelain, famous at home and abroad, with all kinds of styles and designs, of inestimable value of tens of thousands of dollars. The most valuable items included several carved porcelain pieces, made into colorful pavilions and figures, each valued at 4,000 yuan. In addition, snow-white carved porcelain figurines were valued at several hundred to one thousand yuan per piece. Next were colorful figure-painted boneless bowls, valued at thirty to forty yuan each, and fine brushwork figure small vases, valued at one hundred to several tens of yuan each. According to Jingdezhen porcelain merchants, the most famous Jiangxi porcelain makers at the time were Li Guangyan for his sculptures, Wang Puzhang Yingshun for his blue and white porcelain, Jiao Huafeng for his boneless porcelain, Chen Jisheng Wei Tengfang for his carved porcelain, and Chen Xinsheng Lizexuan for his landscape-painted porcelain. Those who want to purchase any item being displayed in the exhibition hall temporarily can't take it out, you can only register first, and trade can only be carried out after the conference is closed. As for the porcelain in the sales area, it can be sold at any time. It is said that about thousands of yuan were sold on the first day. After this was the Hunan Exhibition Hall. Hunan also has a wide variety of special products. Manufactured goods include Hunan writing brushes, Gu embroidery products, firecrackers, bamboo lacquerware, ox hair felt, and artistic paper umbrellas. Hunan porcelain is also considered a fine product with new and innovative styles. Agricultural products include grains, tea, tung oil, grass whips, and raw linen. Mineral products include coal and iron. Heavy industry products include return air pipe machinery. Finally, there was the Guangdong Exhibition Hall. Among the special products of Guangdong, manufactured goods, agricultural products, and everything else were more abundant than in other provinces, because on-site transportation was easier. The most famous were tea, silk, self-made industrial machinery, cement, and sugarcane.

### Tragic Collapse of Baoshan Theater in Hankou

Seventeen People Crushed to Death in a Windstorm; Over Sixty Trampled and Injured

Hankou Correspondence: An unprecedented tragedy occurred suddenly on the 10th at the Baoshan Grand Theater on Baoshantang Street, Zhongshan Road in this city, resulting in as many as seventy or eighty deaths and injuries. The theater's site belonged to the Suhu Guild Hall. It was initially the location of Baoshan Hall's coffin storage. Because the city did not allow the placement of coffins within the urban area, the city government ordered its demolition and relocation. In December 1935, a citizen named Wang Dianqing leased the site and obtained approval from the city government to build a theater to perform Han opera. Due to poor management, performances were repeatedly suspended and resumed. In February of this year, Cao Chunfu and others raised funds to restore it, performing Chu opera. The theater was often sold out and business was far better than before. On the 10th, there were howling winds and torrential rain, but the theater still opened as usual, and the audience was very crowded. Unexpectedly, before the first act was finished, there was a sudden loud noise, and the walls collapsed. Most of the audience sitting on the side were crushed under the walls, with many dying instantly and even more injured. When the tragedy occurred, the entire theater erupted into chaos, and the order was completely disrupted. Those trampled and injured were everywhere. For a time, the sounds of calling for children and seeking mothers and grandfathers were unbearably tragic. Tian Yadan, the director of the police第三分局 in charge of the area, upon hearing the news, immediately led many police officers to rush to the scene for rescue and to maintain order. They pried out eleven dead men, four women, and two small girls from the rubble, totaling seventeen people. The corpses were lying in the theater. Some were crushed into flat shapes, some had fractured bones and shattered bodies, and some had broken heads with brains spilling out. The corpses of the children were even more like two piles of meat, with flesh and blood all blurred. The scene was extremely tragic. The corpses were all examined by Cheng Zongdao and others, the examiners of the Hankou District Court. The relatives who came to identify the bodies cried to the heavens. Approximately sixty people were found to be injured, with the seriously injured sent to the hospital for treatment and the slightly injured cared for at home. The police总局 was notified and督察长 Wang Yufen and Section Chief Dong Keren came to the scene to investigate and handle the aftermath. Subsequent investigation revealed that the collapse of the theater's walls was caused by the collapse of the adjacent Suhu Guild Hall's surrounding wall. The theater's shareholders, Cao Chunfu, and the person in charge of the Suhu Guild Hall, Hu Hongxiang, were taken to the局 for questioning. (March 10)

### Kunshan

Preparing to Build Township Public Cemetery

The county government believes that private tomb construction occupies a lot of land, and the financial cost is especially wasteful and unproductive. It is urgently necessary to prepare to build a public cemetery to promote it. Now, in addition to the first district having a public cemetery, other districts, townships, and towns must also start planning. Therefore, it has ordered each district office to actively proceed, quickly find a suitable cemetery site, in order to comprehensively plan and build it.

Restricting Theater Fundraising

The county government believes that recently there have been many cases of fundraising through theatrical performances, and it is urgently necessary to stipulate the scope to restrict them. It has now been decided that, with the exception of purchasing guns, building warehouses, disaster relief, and various professional activities, other requests in any name will not be approved. On the 10th, the police局 and all branch offices were instructed to comply accordingly.

### Wuxi

Preventing the Spread of Meningitis

Meningitis has been discovered in Xindu Bridge, Qianqiao, Meiyuan, Guangqin District, train station and other places in the fourth district. The Health Office has been vigorously promoting prevention of its spread. However, due to the sudden cold and hot weather, it has not been possible to eliminate it. The director of the office, Tan Shouren, has specially organized five prevention teams to go to the meningitis areas to provide free vaccinations. On the 12th, the first team went to the Shenxin Third Factory area in the western district to eliminate the spread, the second team went to the eighth district, the third team went to the fourth district, the fourth team went to Dongting Town in the second district for vaccinations, and the fifth team gave injections in the factory area around Zhou Shanbang. In total, there were more than 5,000 people. At the same time, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs learned that meningitis was rampant in the county, and specially ordered Director Tan to first prepare a temporary infectious disease hospital before the county hospital was built. All those suffering from meningitis should be sent to the hospital for treatment and to prevent infection.

Clearing up Non-Compliant Inventory

Since the former director Zhu Kaiguan independently reported to the Finance Department for inventory auditing, the land tax in this county has now concluded after ten months. The results of the inventory audit show that there are no discrepancies in the amounts collected and uncollected. However, the inventory is inconsistent, with a discrepancy of more than 97,000 yuan. It is said that the reasons for the discrepancy are that, apart from some cases where officials in the book-keeping office committed fraud and theft, which were reported by the former director Zhu and the book-keeping staff member Deng and the officials were arrested and detained, there were also cases where, during the pre-collection period, the collection officials and local guarantors had a limited time to collect the serial numbers, and many failed to pay on time. Former Director Zhu knew this situation, so he requested an inventory audit to clarify the truth and facilitate the start of the clean-up. The county government has now reported the results of the inventory audit to the Finance Department and notified former Director Zhu to start cleaning up.

### Nantong

Banning Home Spun Silk

The county government believes that the number of cocoons produced in the northern villages of Tongyi is not large, and there are no cocoon shops.

After a review, those who are qualified can start operating. According to regulations, an improvement fee of six yuan should be paid for each dan of silkworm cocoons, and fresh cocoons should be converted at one-third of the rate.

It is reported that the county government will assign household tax inspectors to take on the work.

### Hangzhou

Construction Begins on Dangerous Dike

The seawall near Bapu on the Hangzhou-Pinghu section is particularly dangerous due to years of disrepair. After several surveys by the Construction Department, it was decided to partially rebuild approximately one hundred meters of the most dangerous part of the dike. The cost is more than 80,000 yuan, which has been approved and allocated by the provincial government. The project has been contracted out to Chen Hongji, who has agreed to undertake it. Part of the cement and other materials will be purchased by the Construction Department itself. Construction is scheduled to begin on the 12th and must be completed within eighty-five clear days to prevent accidents during the spring flood season.

### West Qing Volleyball Team Loses to Russian Team Again, Hai Qing Also

West Qing Wins Two Sets to Zero Against Suker in Another Match

In the two Class A matches of the West Qing Volleyball team yesterday, West Qing won against Suker by two sets to zero, as expected. However, Hai Qing unfortunately lost to the Russian team again by zero sets to two, making their championship prospects dangerous again. Their only hope now lies in whether they can beat West Qing again next week. If they win, Hai Qing, West Qing, and the Russian team will form a three-way tie, requiring another final round. Otherwise, West Qing will likely be the champion, and Hai Qing will be relegated to third place. As for the course of yesterday's match, Hai Qing repeatedly took the lead after scoring in the first set, leading 6-4. However, the Russian team scored six consecutive points, leading 10-6. Hai Qing called a timeout, but it had no effect. They only managed to narrow the gap to 10-14 after falling behind 7-14, and then lost 10-15. In the second set, after ties at 2-2, 4-4, and 5-5, Hai Qing still led 9-5. The Russian team called a timeout, and after 10-6, the Russian team surprisingly scored eight consecutive points, coming from behind. Although Hai Qing tried hard to rally, they eventually lost 11-15. The disorganized formation of Hai Qing was the main reason for their defeat in this match.

### Donghua Withdraws from the Shi Gaotuo Cup Semi-Final Today

Labor & Leisure Wins by Default

The football schedule this week was extremely busy, including the Shi Gaotuo Cup semi-final between Donghua, Labor & Leisure. Tomorrow was originally scheduled for the China-Portugal semi-final of the All Nations Cup, both of which were very important. Initially, the West Football Association announced that the China-Portugal match was postponed, but unexpectedly, Donghua suddenly announced its withdrawal today. Labor & Leisure thus won the final qualification by default. As a result, two good matches have been canceled. As for the news of Donghua's withdrawal today, it was notified to this newspaper by the West Football Association authorities by telephone last night, presumably due to Donghua's incomplete personnel.

### The Revival of the East China Eight University Sports Federation

Central University Initiates, Jinling, Soochow, and Others Agree to Participate, First Track and Field Meet to be Held in Mid-May

The East China Eight University Sports Federation has been defunct for more than ten years.

The East China University sports movement, the center of national sports, is so scattered and depressed, which is deeply regrettable. It is reported that Central University recently initiated a movement to restore the former East China Eight University Sports Federation. All like-minded people, regardless of each other, value competition, but especially emphasize the spirit.

### German Four-Year Plan, Elementary and Middle School Students Collect Waste

Started Collecting Animal Bones Yesterday

(National News Agency Berlin, 12th) German elementary school students are responsible for collecting waste in the four-year plan. Today is the first day of implementation. Elementary school students rushed to school, each carrying a bundle of animal bones "because today is Friday for collecting animal bones." Every family has toothpaste tubes, candy tin foil, animal bones, rags, and other waste, all of which are useful raw materials. Now, elementary school students collect as much as possible, which is easy for elementary school students, but reduces the import of raw materials for the country. Because various wastes are collected at the same time, it takes a lot of time to sort them. Therefore, dates are specified, such as "Animal Bone Day," "Metal Day," "Scrap Iron Day," "Rag Day," etc., so that the waste collected on that day can be immediately loaded into vehicles and transported to waste treatment plants.

### The Saying that Pulmonary Tuberculosis is Necessarily Fatal and New Treatments for Lung Disease

Translated from the German Journal of Tuberculosis

(1) The Origin of the Saying that Pulmonary Tuberculosis is Necessarily Fatal

Among the many diseases prevalent in the world, none is as difficult to treat or as widespread as pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption). Pulmonary tuberculosis attacks us constantly, anytime and anywhere. It is the most harmful and deadly infectious disease, and what we fear most. Since ancient times, pulmonary tuberculosis has been considered a fatal disease because it was truly difficult to cure once contracted. Therefore, doctors were helpless when faced with it, and patients were terrified, living with the constant worry of an early death. However, in modern times, with the progress of medicine and the emergence of renowned doctors, after thorough research, it was realized that pulmonary tuberculosis is not necessarily a terminal illness. If treated properly, eight or nine out of ten patients in the early stages can be cured. Even those in the second or third stages have hope of recovery. Only patients who have been ill for too long and have reached the final stage cannot be cured. However, being incurable after a long illness is not unique to pulmonary tuberculosis. Those who contract this disease should not be negligent in the early and middle stages; treatment is possible.

(2) The Discovery of the Pathogenic Bacteria of Pulmonary Tuberculosis

Since ancient times, medical circles in both the East and West have had many empty theories and speculations about the pathogens of pulmonary tuberculosis, all of which were obscure and unclear. Recently, the great German bacteriologist Dr. Koch discovered that the tubercle bacillus is the cause of pulmonary tuberculosis, dispelling thousands of years of darkness and bringing forth a ray of great light. Just as the cholera vibrio is the cause of cholera, the diphtheria bacillus is the cause of diphtheria, and the dysentery bacillus is the cause of dysentery, and as the occurrence of syphilis is based on the syphilis spirochete and the occurrence of leprosy is based on the leprosy bacillus, which is known worldwide, so it is with pulmonary tuberculosis. Its cause is based on the tubercle bacillus. This bacterium is most fond of attacking humans, and its habitat and reproduction are mostly in our lungs. The number of humans harmed by it is countless. In the past, it accounted for one-seventh of the world's population; in modern times, it accounts for one-sixth; and in cities, it reaches one-fifth. It is indeed the most widespread infectious disease.

(3) The Two Great Benefactors of People with Lung Disease

(1) Dr. Koch of Germany

Born in 1843 in the town of Clausthal, Germany. His family was moderately well-off, so he was able to focus on his studies from a young age. After graduating from secondary school, he attended various universities in Germany to study medicine. Before the age of thirty, he discovered bacteria, which astonished renowned doctors in Germany. Several years later, on March 24, 1882, Dr. Koch presented his research and discovery of the tubercle bacillus at the German Physiological Society in Berlin. At that time, the medical community of various countries was shocked. The German government praised his expertise and appointed Dr. Koch as the director of the Institute of Hygiene. Emperors of various countries also presented him with high-level medals, and universities competed to bestow honorary degrees. In 1905, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was also awarded to Dr. Koch. He can be said to have reached the pinnacle of honor in the academic world. Today, the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis is based on Dr. Koch's discovery. His contribution to saving lives and helping the world is truly something that the people of the world will always be grateful for.

(2) Dr. Bergell of Germany

Since Dr. Koch discovered that the tubercle bacillus is the pathogen of pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculosis scholars in the East and West have competed to conduct research, hoping to find a wonderful way to kill this bacterium. However, the results have all been failures. This is because doctors in general have not understood that the tubercle bacillus has a special structure. After Dr. Bergell's painstaking research, he discovered that the tubercle bacillus has a special defense force that can resist the attack of all external medicinal forces. The tubercle bacillus is composed of a neutral fatty inner membrane and an acid-fast waxy outer membrane. Unless a way is found to destroy its waxy defense line and disarm its fatty armament, there is no way to capture the tubercle bacillus and put it to death. Therefore, Dr. Bergell, the great physician of lung disease sufferers all over the world, collected all kinds of medicinal substances from animals, plants, and minerals, and worked hard on research for decades, exhausting countless brainpower and pouring out countless heart's blood. Recently, he finally discovered that the compressed juice of a special animal's mesentery gland contains a special effective ingredient that has a strong dewaxing effect on the tubercle bacillus. This is truly a major success in the radical treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a major question in the medical world for thousands of years.

(4) The Special Treatment for Pulmonary Tuberculosis

The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that location to block the flow of blood. In addition, the tubercle bacillus can secrete an acid-fast wax to surround its body to prevent the invasion of all external medicinal forces. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are used, whether taken internally or injected, they ultimately cannot reach the actual body of the pathogen. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, drug therapy, and all other treatments that doctors have been accustomed to using in the past have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for lung disease has spread throughout the world. This is because people did not know this profound academic theory. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the above-mentioned academic theory, continued their research without sparing any effort. As a result, they finally created this chemical holy agent that kills all tubercle bacilli, called Sanosin. This drug was successfully invented by following the most insightful medical principles of Dr. Koch of Germany, the discoverer of the tubercle bacillus, and Dr. Bergell of Germany, the inventor of the dewaxing technique for the tubercle bacillus. According to the current experimental reports from lung disease sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules in the lesions of lung disease and dissolving the wax, and it also has bactericidal power. It can radically cure pulmonary tuberculosis in the first, second, and third stages and has a truly effective effect. In China, it has been tested by the Central Hygienic Laboratory of the National Government, and its medicinal properties are mild and non-toxic, with absolutely no side effects. A brief description of its therapeutic effects is given below.

(1) If the efficacy of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, the acid-fastness of the tubercle bacilli will disappear after one minute, and after three minutes, these tubercle bacilli will be completely killed, with not a single one spared.

(2) According to animal experiments, it was found that "Sanosin" can penetrate into tuberculous lesions. If the tubercle bacilli lurking in the lesions are examined, they will lose their acid-fastness, which proves that their wax has been completely dissolved.

(3) If patients take "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they will immediately see good conditions such as thinning of sputum and lowering of body temperature.

(4) If they continue to take "Sanosin" internally for more than 30 to 60 days, they will clearly see an increase in body weight, a surge in appetite, and a gradual easing of all symptoms, ultimately achieving the great effect of reversing fate and recreating life.

### Kiangsu Province Trains Elementary Education Personnel

Starting August 10th

The Kiangsu Provincial Department of Education believes that elementary education is the local education center, and the personnel directly responsible for it, such as the education committee members of each county and school district, as well as the principals of primary schools, occupy a leading position. Their thoughts, knowledge, words, and actions are all related to the progress of education in a county. In this extraordinary period, in order to meet the needs, unify thinking, supplement knowledge, and rectify words and deeds, it has been decided to convene the education committee members of each county and the principals of public and private complete primary schools in the province for training during the summer vacation this year, and to formulate the "Twelve Articles of Simple Rules for the First Elementary Education Personnel Training Institute of Kiangsu Province."

### Kiangsu Province Elementary School Teachers Assist in Land Reporting

The Department of Finance will jointly order the Department of Education to follow. The Kiangsu Department of Finance previously stated that the land reporting work in various counties is complicated and arduous, and the results are largely due to the participation of education administration personnel and school staff and students in publicity, compilation, and investigation. The department instructed Tai County, which is currently in the midst of land reporting, to emulate the practice in order to achieve significant results. After receiving the order, the county not only complied but also formulated measures for elementary school teachers to assist in land reporting and simple rules for rewarding and punishing elementary school teachers who assist in land reporting. The department believes that the proposal is feasible and plans to issue an order to each county to follow. The two measures are recorded below:

Measures for Elementary School Teachers in the County to Assist in Land Reporting: 1. In order to ensure the completion of land reporting within the time limit and to achieve excellent results, this county specially focuses the efforts of elementary school teachers throughout the county to assist, in order to supplement the inability of township and town leaders. 2. Assistance tasks are divided into (1) compiling texts, drawing maps, and calculating; (2) extracting texts and organizing; (3) filling out reporting forms on behalf of illiterate landowners; (4) assisting township and town leaders in reviewing and compiling statistics. 3. Regarding the assistance tasks in the first article, the work in items (1) and (2) is more complicated and time is tight, and the county government's education bureau may order the suspension of classes for a few days to carry out a general mobilization. The work in items (3) and (4) will be assisted after class. 4. The classes suspended by each elementary school due to assisting in land reporting should be made up for by shortening the dates of the spring and summer vacations. 5. Regarding the assistance period in the first article, the work in items (1) and (2) is scheduled from February 15 to February 28, and the work in items (3) and (4) is scheduled from March 1 to April 10. 6. In order to enable elementary school teachers throughout the county to thoroughly understand the methods and steps for handling land reporting, the county government's education bureau will regularly convene elementary school teachers throughout the county to hold a land reporting lecture. 7. The assistance location of each elementary school teacher shall be distributed by the county magistrate and the director of the education bureau. 8. The assistance work of each elementary school teacher should have a specific report, and its form will be determined separately. 9. The results of each elementary school teacher's assistance in handling land reporting will be determined as one of the evaluations for this academic year. The reward and punishment measures are determined separately. 10. Matters not listed in these measures may be ordered by the county government's education bureau at any time. 11. These measures shall be reported by the county government's education bureau to the provincial department for filing.

### European Early Childhood Education (－)

— Weng Zhida

Early childhood education is a product of modern times. It only began to appear in Europe in the early nineteenth century. When it comes to the pioneers of early childhood education, we easily think of educators such as Oberlin, Owen, and Froebel. Although the infant schools or kindergartens they pioneered were already famous in Europe at that time, the governments of various countries were not enthusiastic about recognizing early childhood education as a formal stage of education at all levels. For example, in Prussia, Froebel's kindergarten was still prohibited in 1851. What is most noteworthy is that the first countries in Europe to establish public infant school networks were the Latin countries that adhere to Roman Catholicism. The non-Latin countries with similar situations were Great Britain and the Netherlands. Belgium only recognized kindergartens as part of the public school system in 1833. France only began subsidizing infant schools in 1837. In 1850, Spain had established 41 early childhood education institutions nationwide. The establishment of a public infant school system in the two Swiss cantons of Vaud and Neuchâtel was earlier than in other cantons. Geneva was established in 1872, and the establishment of Vaud was slightly later than Geneva. In the German-speaking areas, including the German cantons of Switzerland, although there were pioneering early childhood education experts such as Froebel and Pestalozzi, kindergartens were not included in the national education system. Until recently, public kindergartens were established by various cities, and the expenses were the responsibility of the local administrative authorities. In the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, except for Finland, there is no early childhood education to speak of. In the remaining European countries, the government only pays attention to the regulations on the age of admission to kindergartens, and this only started after the Great War. The early childhood education situation in various countries will now be briefly described as follows.

㊀ Great Britain

England and Scotland are both recognized worldwide as pioneers in early childhood education. Educators such as Owen, Wilderspin, and Stow strongly advocated for the need for special educational institutions for infants. In 1870, after the establishment of local education authorities, infant schools were recognized as a type of public school. By 1874, 617,910 children aged three to six in England and Wales were studying in infant schools and kindergartens. Ten years later, this number increased to 841,128. Since 1900, the situation of early childhood education in England and Wales is shown in the following table:

Year Number of children aged three to five in school Percentage of the total number of children aged three to five nationwide

1900 615,607 43%

1910 350,591 23%

1920 175,467 15%

1930 159,335 13%

Based on the above figures, it can be seen that the number of children in England and Wales studying in infant schools or kindergartens is gradually decreasing. This situation is the result of changes in education policy. In 1905, the government sent a committee to investigate the implementation of early childhood education. The conclusion of the investigation was that if only infant education institutions are established, but there is a lack of special school buildings and equipment, and a lack of specially trained teachers, this kind of enrollment will obviously hinder the development of children's lives. Therefore, local administrative authorities focused their efforts on qualitative improvement, rather than blindly increasing the quantity. Since then, the policy of early childhood education has not changed until now. Special emphasis is placed on specially trained teachers. In 1918, a new education regulation was promulgated, and the government only began to subsidize nurseries, which seem to be not very different from infant schools. However, in England and Wales, there are very few nurseries, and there are currently only 65, accommodating 5,000 children.

㊁ Belgium

In Belgium, early childhood education is the most developed. Kindergartens are independent educational institutions, accommodating children aged three to six, and receiving central subsidies. Kindergartens nationwide accommodate approximately 70% of children of this age group.

### The Municipal Party Headquarters Holds a Grand Meeting

The Municipal Party Headquarters gathered representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai at the Municipal Public Education Center yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to hold a memorial meeting for the 12th anniversary of the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen. More than 500 representatives from various agencies, schools, and groups, including Pan Gongzhan, Mao Yun, Huang Xianggu, Du Mengsen, Tan Gengxin, Chen Peide, Zhang Yichen, Xu Zexiang, and Lin Kecong, attended. After Standing Committee Member Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, led the ceremony, the chairman reported on the significance of the commemoration of the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen and future efforts. After the report, slogans were chanted: ㊀ Promote the revolutionary spirit of Premier Sun Yat-sen; ㊁ Continue the revolutionary cause of Premier Sun Yat-sen; ㊂ Strictly abide by Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings; ㊃ Step up production and construction; ㊄ Commemorate Premier Sun Yat-sen and strive to defend against insults and save the country; ㊅ Commemorate Premier Sun Yat-sen and eliminate the Red bandits and traitors; ㊆ Long live the Three Principles of the People; ㊇ Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; ㊈ Long live the Republic of China. The meeting was then adjourned.

Pan's Speech

Pan Gongzhan, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said in his speech: Today, I would like to give you a brief report on the significance of the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen and future efforts. First, when we commemorate the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen, we must not forget the tragic and passionate history of the Republic of China created by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past. Mr. Sun Yat-sen lived and died for the Republic of China. If during this period, there had been no loud call from Mr. Sun Yat-sen to lead the National Revolution, the Republic of China could not have been born. Specifically, the Republic of China succeeded due to the continued efforts of the Tongmenghui, led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and even the Chinese Kuomintang, in creation and maintenance. Therefore, our commemoration of the life of Mr. Sun Yat-sen includes the commemoration of the sacrificing spirit of the blood and heads of the martyrs, and all the struggles for the country and the nation. Second, when we commemorate the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen, we must review what we have neglected regarding Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings in the twelve years since his passing, and which points have been realized and which have not. The greatness of Premier Sun Yat-sen's spirit and the breadth of his teachings make us feel that we can never say enough. However, if we analyze Premier Sun Yat-sen's will, we can know its main points, especially the goals, methods, and paths of saving the country that have already been indicated to us. What Premier Sun Yat-sen strived for throughout his life was the National Revolution, and the goal of the National Revolution was to seek freedom and equality for China. Therefore, the National Revolution is the total mobilization of the entire nation, and the freedom and equality it seeks are not for individuals or a certain class, but for the entire country and the entire nation. In short, it is for the public and not for the private. Therefore, Premier Sun Yat-sen wrote the four characters "The World is for All," which is what he meant. Then, have we now completely achieved freedom and equality for China? Our compatriots, in the thousands and tens of thousands, are in a state of displacement and suffering, and unequal treaties still bind our entire nation. This is certainly still waiting for us to strive to realize the goal of this National Revolution. In his will, Premier Sun Yat-sen also showed us the methods and paths of striving for the National Revolution. Internally, it is to awaken the masses; externally, it is to unite with nations in the world that treat us equally, and then fight together. Because if we want the nations of the world to treat us equally, then our own nation must be able to wake up. Therefore, in recent years, both the central and local governments have actively promoted literacy campaigns, the New Life Movement, and collective training. This is to enable the people to gain a patriotic concept in the literacy campaign, develop a spirit of order and discipline in the New Life Movement, and cultivate a courageous physique in the collective training. This is the truly concrete movement to awaken the nation. Once the entire nation can fully accept the training of these three movements, we dare to believe that the nations of the world will have the possibility of treating us equally. Otherwise, it is just a disguised form of "submission" and "surrender." In the entire will, Premier Sun Yat-sen also put forward three "musts." The first is "must awaken the masses..." The second is "must follow the National Reconstruction Program written by me..." The third is "must in the shortest period..." These three "musts" are the practical indications of all the methods and principles for us to achieve the goal of the National Revolution. This is unbreakable, and we must take it as our guide and strive to do it. Third, when we commemorate the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen, we must not distort or misunderstand Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Regarding the goal of the National Revolution, which is to seek freedom and equality for China, I have already said it briefly. We often hear foreigners say that the Chinese are a sheet of loose sand. This is because the Chinese only know personal freedom, but do not know the freedom of the nation. We must sacrifice personal freedom to seek the freedom of the nation. This is the true meaning of the National Revolution that Premier Sun Yat-sen showed us. Therefore, we must now turn this sheet of loose sand into a strong piece of cement, so that we can resist foreign aggression. Some people also misunderstand the awakening of the masses as accommodating the communists, and the union with nations in the world that treat us equally as allying with Russia. Regarding the former, let us first talk about the current situation of the Communist Party. The Communist Party organizes its own government, uses armed rebellion as its slogan, and engages in their provocations and divisions, which have evolved into various tragedies of murder and arson. May I ask if they are fighting together for the survival of the entire nation? Regarding the latter, does Soviet Russia treat us equally? We are heartbroken by the creation of a puppet state in the three northeastern provinces, but is the Outer Mongolia puppet republic not created by Soviet Russia? At the same time, the Chinese Eastern Railway in the three northeastern provinces, they once declared that all the rights obtained by Tsarist Russia through acts of aggression would be abandoned. As a result, they sold the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan. Is this treating us equally? The boundary between friend and foe in our international relations should be based on interests. The so-called joys and sorrows, separation and reunion, change in an instant. We cannot but ask what the truth is, and if we do things in a muddle, we will inevitably fail. Premier Sun Yat-sen was originally a doctor, first a doctor for individuals, and later a doctor for the country. This will is like a good prescription, so we must earnestly abide by the true meaning of Premier Sun Yat-sen's will and strive to do it. This is the recognition we should have when commemorating the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen today.

### Two Major Ceremonies of the Municipal Government

The Shanghai Municipal Government held the 12th anniversary of the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen and the 9th Arbor Day Ceremony of Shanghai at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 10:00 AM. Mayor Wu, Commander Yang, Secretary-General Yu, and the directors of the Social Affairs, Police, Finance, Public Works, and Health Bureaus, as well as all officers and staff, and more than a thousand teachers, staff, and students from municipal primary and secondary schools, attended. The presidium consisted of seven people, including Mayor Wu, Commander Yang, Pan Gongzhan, Cai Jinjun, Xu Peihuang, Shen Yi, and Li Tingan. The meeting was opened on time with the ringing of a bell. The participants stood in formation in the auditorium, with the military on the right and the civil on the left. Mayor Wu led the ceremony according to etiquette and reported on the significance of commemorating Premier Sun Yat-sen and holding the Arbor Day Ceremony. Commander Yang then gave a speech, followed by the singing of the Arbor Day song. After the ceremony, a photograph was taken on the steps in front of the auditorium, and then they went around to the open space around the bronze statue of Premier Sun Yat-sen behind the Municipal Government to plant trees. Mayor Wu and other bureau chiefs and officers held hoes and shovels to plant more than 60 pine and cypress trees. The event ended at 11:00 AM.

Mayor's Speech

Mayor Wu said in his speech at the memorial meeting: Today is the 12th anniversary of the passing of Premier Sun Yat-sen and Arbor Day. We are holding these two ceremonies at the same time to express the firm determination of all party comrades and compatriots across the country to continue Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings on saving and building the country. Premier Sun Yat-sen said, "The purpose of revolution is construction, and the top priority of construction is people's livelihood." People's livelihood is the greatest and ultimate goal of nation-building. If the problem of people's livelihood is not solved, the nation cannot be revitalized and the country cannot be strong. The most important thing for people to live is food. Our country is founded on agriculture, and the means of survival passed down by our ancestors is farming. However, according to customs trade reports, agricultural products account for the majority of imports each year, which proves that the most important skill for survival passed down by our ancestors has been almost completely lost by us, and we have to rely on foreigners. Moreover, the development of industry in European and American countries is beyond our reach, because as life evolves, their daily necessities must rely on foreigners. Our country is a huge nation with a population of 450 million, and its survival needs cannot be met independently, which is a serious problem. If it is not solved, there is no guarantee of national revival. Therefore, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, compatriots across the country will complete the unfinished will of the President. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's creation of national economic construction holds great promise for the future of the nation. Many teachers and elementary school students are participating today. An ancient philosopher said, "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a person." It can be seen that the work of cultivating people is even more arduous. Today, our country is in a very critical situation and needs knowledgeable and responsible people. I hope that parents, elder brothers, teachers, and elders will take on this important work.

Yang's Speech

Commander Yang said in his speech: The Premier of our party passed away in Peiping at 9:30 AM on this day in the fourteenth year. The mission and responsibility left to us are of great importance. We should uphold the Premier's intention to save the country and the people, invigorate our spirit, and support the leader. ㊀ Strive to implement the New Life Movement, cultivate the habits of the new citizens, and become a modern nation; ㊁ Promote the national spirit and strive for economic construction; ㊂ In the current stage of the revolution, important tasks such as suppressing bandits and defending against insults must continue to be carried out according to the original policy to eliminate all evil forces at home and abroad.

### Obstacles in Yugu Village Were Not Removed Yesterday

Residents Who Paid Dues Protested to the Municipal Council; All Parties Expect New Developments Today

Central News Agency: The Municipal Council blocked the entrances and exits of Yugu Village in the area of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads, and although the Municipal Government protested, the obstacles were not removed yesterday. The situation yesterday is divided into the following:

Obstacles Were Not Removed Yesterday

The obstacles set up by the Municipal Council at the entrances of the alleys in Yugu Village, and the Chinese and foreign constables sent there, were not removed yesterday. All residents of the village could only pass through the stores along the road in the village. All the ditches and sewage pipes were pried open. Fortunately, there was a septic tank next to the village to channel all the excrement into the tank. Therefore, the general residents were very calm yesterday, and the village was very clean.

Residents Protested to the Municipal Council

Most of the residents of the village had paid the patrol fees to the Municipal Council in full. Therefore, yesterday, all the residents who had already paid the fees jointly filed a written protest to the Municipal Council, refuting the Municipal Council's excuse that the owners failed to collect the patrol fees on behalf of the Municipal Council, and corrected the Council's use of force to coerce them. However, the Municipal Council still ignored the residents' protests.

Expression of the Chairman of the Municipal Council

According to Mr. Fessenden, the chairman of the Municipal Council, who told visiting reporters, he believed that the Municipal Council Police Department's closure of the entrances of the alleys in Yugu Village and the blocking of sewage pipes were not wrong. However, he said that he did not think there was any intention to continue to implement this method in other places. Regarding the protest raised by the Municipal Government, he believed that the matter was a negotiation between the Municipal Council and the owners of the village, so it seemed unnecessary to reply.

New Developments Expected Today

Since the Municipal Council did not reply to the protests or remove the obstacles in the village, and because yesterday was a holiday commemorating the passing of the Premier, the negotiations were not continued. The Caojiadu Police Sub-Bureau still sent police to station in the village. However, since this matter concerns sovereignty, and the residents of the village have suffered a lot from the two days of closure, all parties expect new developments today.

The Real Estate Industry Sent Personnel to Investigate Yesterday

Xinhua News Agency: The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Guild felt that the forced blocking of roads by the Municipal Council in the Extra-Settlement Roads area of Yugu Village in Shanghai West was closely related to the deep interests of the industry, and the members came to the meeting one after another to request negotiations. Yesterday, Wu Yuncheng, an executive of the guild, was specially sent to investigate the situation in order to report to the authorities and seriously negotiate. According to Mr. Wu, when I went to the village to investigate, the iron gates at the entrances and exits of Yuyuan Road, Difeng Road, and Daxilu were forcibly covered with barbed wire and supported by wooden fences by the Municipal Council. Chinese and foreign constables were stationed in front of each gate. The village was patrolled by a large number of constables. The residents of the village entered and exited through a small gate near the Chinese boundary. The Municipal Police Department also sent four policemen to stand guard in front of the gate. The landlords and tenants in the village were all quietly awaiting the results of the Municipal Government's negotiations to deal with the matter. Our guild has a deep relationship with our industry regarding the Extra-Settlement Roads issue, so we specially request the Municipal Government to seriously negotiate and reclaim sovereignty in order to show justice.

### Movements of the Italian Air Force Attaché

Mr. Capurro, the Italian Air Force Attaché to China, was transferred back to his country for a new position. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, he departed from Shanghai on the Italian ship Conte Verde. Personnel from the Italian Embassy and friends of Mr. Capurro went to the dock to see him off. As for the new Italian Ambassador to China, Mr. Cara, he is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around mid-May. Mr. Cubey, the British Air Force Attaché in Shanghai, was summoned by telegram from Beijing to Guangzhou by Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, who was on his way from Beijing to Guangzhou, to meet with and accompany the authorities in Guangzhou. Mr. Cubey was summoned and is scheduled to leave on the 16th and is expected to return to Shanghai at the beginning of next month. At that time, Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen will also travel to Shanghai with him, and then return to Beijing.

### Leaders of the Shanghai Business and Industry Community Telegraph Request to Appoint Another Special Envoy to England

Because Director-General Kong is in Charge of National Finance and It Is Inconvenient for Him to Leave for a Long Time

Central News Agency: The Chinese government has internally decided to appoint Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, as a special envoy to attend the coronation ceremony of the British King. Mr. Kong is scheduled to depart on April 2 and return to China in August. It is learned that leaders of the Shanghai business and industry community, such as Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Qian Xinzhi, believe that Mr. Kong, as Minister of Finance, is in charge of national finance, and it seems inconvenient for him to travel far. They have telegraphed President Chiang, requesting that another high-ranking official with prestige and respect be appointed to England so that both national diplomacy and political affairs can be properly handled.

### Minister to Poland Wei Chenzu Left for His Post Yesterday

The newly appointed Chinese Minister to Poland, Mr. Wei Chenzu, left for Italy yesterday morning at 8:00 AM with his family on the Italian ship Conte Verde, and then went to the Polish capital to take up his new post. Mr. Wei boarded the ship at 11:00 PM the night before. Zhao Tiezhuan, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others went to the dock to see him off.

### Plea to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau by Chinese Laborers Returning from France

Representatives Petitioning in Nanjing to Depart Soon, Requesting Travel Expenses to Return to Their Native Places

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, thirty-three Chinese laborers, including Ding Huanzhang, who participated in the war in France, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. It was originally planned to send Wang Yushan, Long Fuqi, Ding Huanzhang, and others to Nanjing yesterday to petition the central government for relief. However, due to the lack of time to process the petition, it was decided to postpone their trip to Nanjing until today or tomorrow.

Request for Transportation Tickets

Yesterday, these Chinese laborers, facing hardship in Shanghai, sent Ding Huanzhang and Yang Zhengxiang to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to request free transportation tickets and travel expenses to return to their respective native places. Tan Zhonglu of the bureau received them and promised to ask the director for instructions.

Negotiating Deposits

When these Chinese laborers were in France, they deposited 15,000 francs of their private savings at the Chinese Consulate General in Paris, intending to use it for medical expenses in case of illness. (According to French factory rules, workers receive medical expenses and all related costs from the factory for up to six months in case of illness, after which the subsidy is terminated.) Upon their return to China, they were told that the money had been remitted. However, when they inquired at the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, they were told that the consulate had telegraphed denying the existence of the deposit. Therefore, the laborers decided to petition the French Embassy, the French Consulate, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to recover the money.

Returning to Native Places in Batches

After the returned laborers arrived in Shanghai, due to the lack of deposit funds, they requested relief from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and planned to visit the director of the bureau again today to request transportation tickets. Once they receive them, they will return to their native places in Tianjin and Shandong in batches. However, they have no foothold in their hometowns and are destitute, making their situation very bleak and difficult.

One Thousand Remaining

According to Luo Jinwen, a representative, when speaking to reporters yesterday, "Although our return this time is due to dismissal, in reality, Shi Baozhen, a Chinese interpreter, made things difficult and instructed the factory owner of the 克立沙 factory to expel us, so we were unable to bring back all of our belongings. Regarding this matter, we will also request the central government to instruct the embassy and consulates in France to negotiate." When asked about the number of Chinese laborers who remained in France to participate in the war, he replied, "There were a total of 56,000 people when we went. Apart from those who have returned to China successively, there are still 1,000 people. They have all married French women and have children, so they all have jobs to make a living."

### Japanese Military Attachés All Depart Shanghai

### Workers at the No. 10 Meiya Silk Factory Still on Strike Yesterday

Party and Government to Send Personnel to Mediate Today

According to the Da Gong News Agency, more than 500 workers at the No. 10 Silk Weaving Factory of the Meiya Company on Hengbang Road in Zhabei suddenly announced a joint strike at 6:00 p.m. on the 11th because their request for a 30% increase in wages was not met.

### The Water Level of the Sichuan River Drops Again, Making the Entire Line Impassable

The Xiang River Rises and All Ships Resume Service, Six Companies Continue to Reduce Low-Water Fees, the Spring Retreat of Water is Rare

The route from Hankou to Changsha was the most severely affected by the water retreat last year, to the point where ships could not pass. Cargo and passengers were transferred by private boats and other means. The six companies then increased the low-water fees on this route to 100%. Recently, due to the rise in water, the Changsha liners have gradually become navigable. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also leased the Datong ship to restore the Shanghai-Hunan route and at the same time reduced the added low-water fees by 50%. Until recently, the water in the Xiang River has risen even more, making navigation more convenient. The six companies decided yesterday (the 12th) to reduce the low-water fees by another 25%, leaving 25%. When the water in the Xiang River rises to a considerable level and the entire line of ships can pass smoothly, the remaining fees will be removed. As for the Sichuan River route, since the water retreat last winter cut off the route, the Minsheng Company has opened it in three sections to maintain transportation between Chongqing and Yichang, so that freight transportation has not been interrupted. It is now springtime, and the river water is rising again. The water levels in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are continuing to rise. However, the situation on the Sichuan River route this year is particularly unusual. Recently, from Chongqing to Yichang, the water level has not only not risen, but has instead dropped sharply, which is a rare occurrence in previous years. Yesterday, the local shipping companies received a telegram from Yichang stating that the water in the Sichuan River was continuing to drop. Yichang has retreated to one foot nine inches below the water level and is continuing to fall. Chongqing has also retreated to one foot six inches below the water level, but the water level seems to be stabilizing and will not decrease further. However, there is still no hope of passage on the entire Sichuan River route.

### Prostitute Accuses of Robbery After Becoming a Concubine

Robbery by People from the Brothel, Detained and Sent to Court

Zhang Xiaoyun, an 18-year-old woman from Suzhou, was originally a prostitute in a long-term brothel. She met Yu Huasheng, a department store businessman, in the brothel. They fell in love, and Yu paid for Zhang's redemption last year, making her his concubine. They built a golden house at No. 15 Huayuanfang, Rue Père Robert, in the French Concession, and lived together in love. Zhang Xiaoyun reported to the French Concession Police that at 2 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, her fellow villagers Zhu Qiaomei (20 years old), who lived at No. 36 Daqingli, Nanjing Road, and Zhu Yunzhou (53 years old), who lived at No. 91 Guangxi Road, etc., brought two women with them and robbed her of a 400-yuan passbook, 400 yuan in cash, a gold bracelet, and a diamond ring. She requested that the case be investigated, the thieves be arrested, and the stolen goods be recovered. The detective arrested Zhu Qiaomei and Zhu Yunzhou and sent them to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District the day before yesterday. The Police Department's lawyer Chen Shucheng stated the case, stating that the defendants were arrested by the police based on the complainant's report of robbery and requested a postponement to arrest the accomplices who were still at large before prosecuting them. Zhu Qiaomei confessed that she went with Lao Er and Lao Wu. Zhu Yunzhou confessed that Lao Wu was his wife and that Zhang Xiaoyun had promised to subsidize her adoptive mother 15 yuan per month when she was redeemed from the brothel. Because she had stopped paying, her adoptive mother asked them to collect it and that there was no robbery. They only took a passbook and that Lao Er and Lao Wu had it. There was no cash, gold bracelet, or diamond ring. Judge Sun Penghai verified the confession and ordered a postponement to the 15th for another hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Thief Sentenced for Snatching Dancer's Wallet

Imprisonment for Six Months

The Hong sisters, Hong Yunxian and Hong Manhua, dancers at the Metropolitan Dance Hall, lived at No. 8 Xinmin Village, Rue Maréchal Foch, in the French Concession. At 4:45 p.m. on the 3rd of the month, the Hong sisters took a rickshaw to go shopping at the company. When the rickshaw passed the intersection of Route de la Course and Rue du Dragon, a bandit, Tang Qihuan from Beiping, came from behind and snatched Hong Yunxian's wallet (containing 70 yuan in legal tender) and fled. The Hong sisters got out of the rickshaw and chased after him. When they chased to the intersection of Rue Yu Qiaqing and Avenue Edward VII, the Chinese Detective Feng Xiushan and Chinese police officers from the Zhabei Police Station arrested Tang Qihuan and brought him back to the police station with the wallet. The next morning, Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for robbery in the First Special District Court. Because Hong Yunxian did not appear, and the police also needed to investigate whether Tang had committed other crimes, the court announced a postponement. Yesterday, Judge Qian Hongye reopened the criminal court for a continued hearing. Police Lawyer Qian stated that during the extended period, it was found that Tang had not committed any other crimes, so he requested a judgment in accordance with the law. Then, Hong Yunxian presented evidence that Tang had indeed robbed her wallet. Tang also pleaded guilty. Judge Qian verified the confession and sentenced Tang Qihuan to six months in prison for robbery as a warning, and the stolen goods were returned to the original owner.

### Detective Zhang Wenbin Sentenced for Fraud

Zhang Wenbin, a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, was under the command of Lu Ying when he was the captain in September of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. He disregarded the law and falsely accused Yang Baoshan, who lived at No. 4 Xingyeli, Avenue Brenan, of smoking opium. He brought him to the station and poured tap water into his mouth and nose, torturing and threatening him to extort 20 yuan in national currency. Yang had endured it all along. However, on April 12th of the 25th year of the Republic of China, Zhang Wenbin and the fleeing detectives Xiao Huaibaozi and Du Sanhua went to Yang Baoshan's house to search for smoking paraphernalia and extorted him again. Yang Baoshan reported to the bureau because Chief Cai was now known for his hatred of evil and the detective team had been reorganized. Zhang Wenbin was arrested and sent to the Songhu Garrison Command. Because the crime was an ordinary criminal offense and did not involve military matters, it was transferred to the local court for public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Yu Lude opened the criminal court and sentenced Zhang Wenbin to one year and eight months in prison for fraud, deprived him of his civil rights for three years, and said to him: "Detectives are supposed to protect the lives and property of the people, but you are harming the people. You should be severely punished. However, considering that the amount obtained is small, you are given leniency." Zhang Bing refused to accept the verdict and appealed according to law.

### Japanese Smuggling Copper Coins

For the Manufacture of Shell Casings, Customs Has Already Seized One Case

According to local Japanese newspapers, when the Shanghai Maru was sailing from Shanghai to Nagasaki before 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, a Japanese passenger attempted to smuggle copper coins worth 1,000 yuan in silver coins out of the country and was discovered by customs anti-smuggling officers. Twenty Japanese people on the ship rose up to make trouble, resulting in a fierce conflict. However, the copper coins were eventually confiscated by customs. At that time, three other Japanese people were also discovered by customs officers trying to board the ship with copper coins, and the Japanese consulate police ordered the three people to stay in Shanghai.

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that due to the recent surge in Japanese arms manufacturing, the price of copper has risen, causing many Japanese people in Shanghai to smuggle copper coins. It is said that they are mostly used to manufacture shell casings. Today it was learned that the price of copper on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in February was 8.3% higher than in January, with the recent price being 144.45 Japanese yen per 100 catties. The copper coins being smuggled out are all old-style copper coins, which are being gradually recalled by the government. It is said that some cigarette paper shops and small money shops in the French Concession are buying them and selling them to Japanese people.

### Ningbo Association Cables Ministry of Finance to Advocate for Zhang Jingle

The Dagong News Agency reports: The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, previously based on a letter from Zhang Xu Huicheng, wife of Zhang Jingle, manager of the Laobaosheng Bank on Avenue du Baille in the French Concession, stated that her husband had been accused by Wu Pengnian to the Ministry of Finance of illegally transporting silver for export, leading to his detention and imprisonment by the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office. Requesting an appeal, the association sent personnel to investigate and found that it was a malicious accusation motivated by resentment. Yesterday, they sent a cable to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they forward a letter to the Local Court for a swift release to protect the innocent. The original cable states: "To Minister Kong, Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: Our fellow townsman Zhang Jingle has been running the Laobaosheng Bank in Shanghai for many years and has always been law-abiding. Recently, Wu Pengnian, harboring resentment, secretly reported to the Ministry, accusing Zhang of violating the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Offenses Against National Currency, etc. A letter was issued to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation, and Zhang was summoned and detained. To date, there is no evidence. Our association, based on the family's request for redress, has repeatedly investigated the truth and learned that Wu Pengnian and Zhang Jingle were originally old acquaintances who jointly operated the bank. Later, due to Wu's debt to the shop and issues regarding his withdrawal from the partnership, litigation ensued for many years, leading to animosity and malicious accusations to achieve his revenge. We hereby cable this to respectfully request your review and approval, and to promptly inform the Shanghai Local Court to terminate the investigation process and issue a non-prosecution decision to protect the innocent. Deeply grateful. Yu Qiaqing et al. of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai kowtow, gray."

### Qiao Chunsheng's Lawsuit for Property Division Continued Yesterday

Qiao Zhiqing, a deceased local resident of No. 9 Chenghua Lane, Fusantang Street, Xiaonanmen, owned eight barges worth over ten thousand yuan during his lifetime. His wife, Ms. Lu, also passed away on December 19th of last year. However, Qiao had two daughters from his previous wife who are already married, namely Xu Qiaomin and Xu Qiao Suzhen.

### Uncle Extorts Nephew

The Old Case of Kaiming Bookstore Remains Unresolved, Wang Chunru Relapses

Wang Chunru from Suzhou, currently 43 years old, never engages in honest work and is always associated with ruffians. On August 5, 1935, while working as a senior clerk at the Kaiming Bookstore on Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, he took advantage of his position to steal 350 yuan from the bookstore and fled without a trace, hiding in his hometown. Later, after Kaiming Bookstore discovered this, they reported it to the relevant police authorities, and a reward was issued for his arrest. After a year had passed and believing the case to be quiet, Wang came to Shanghai alone and hid in the home of his nephew, Tan Shiqi, at No. 5 Pailou Lane, Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. Tan is thirty years old and works as a clerk in the accounting department of the American-owned Aetna Insurance Company on the Bund in the Public Concession, so his monthly income is quite high. Since Wang resided in Tan's home, they had always lived in peace. Unexpectedly, Wang suddenly relapsed and had evil intentions. On the 1st, 5th, and 15th of last month, he wrote three threatening letters, extorting 20 yuan from Tan, threatening to harm him if he did not comply. However, after receiving the letters at the company, Tan believed that Wang, who was staying at his home every day, would not have such malicious intentions and ignored them. Angry that his nephew had ignored him, Wang harbored resentment and invaded Tan's room at about 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, forcibly demanding money from Tan. Tan was already in bed and sound asleep, and was startled awake. Greatly shocked, he hastily put on his clothes and ran out, reporting the situation to the Dongjiadu Police Station. Police Chiefs Zhou and Liu, after receiving the report, immediately dispatched police officer Gao Junhai to arrest Wang and bring him to the station. After questioning by Police Chief Yi Zuanren, the plaintiff Tan Shiqi testified as above, and Wang Chunru admitted that he had written letters to threaten his nephew to extort money. After reviewing the testimony, Chief Yi, considering the case related to threats, immediately prepared a document to report it to the General Bureau for punishment.

At about 10:00 AM yesterday, a child collecting garbage discovered straw and oilcloth covering the bank of the river next to the west end of the Holy Trinity Church at Tanjia Bridge, Zhabei. When the child tried to pick up the oilcloth, he was shocked to find two corpses. He immediately ran to report it to the patrol officer at the nearby Tanjia Bridge Police Station, who went to investigate and confirmed the report. He then reported it to Police Chief Yang Chunran, who brought police officers to reinvestigate. They found the deceased were stark naked and barefoot, one with his head to the south and feet to the north, about forty years old, and the other with his head to the north and feet to the south, about fifty years old. Each had four or five knife wounds on their heads. They immediately reported the information to the Xinzha Police Branch, which reported it to the Inspectorate of the Police Headquarters. At the same time, they instructed the local bailiff to report it to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. At about 4:00 PM, prosecutor Wang Jiamei and clerk Wang Guanji arrived at the scene. The autopsy determined that the two unidentified male corpses had died from their injuries while alive. Because no family members were present, the bailiff was instructed to arrange for burial.

### Achieving True Unification Through Economic Construction

— Du Chongyuan

The past failure to complete the unification of China was fundamentally due to the economic and social ideas of the countryside being limited by the concept of "me" and lacking the knowledge and training of modern citizens, as well as the ability to organize. Mr. Lu Zuofu often said that the Chinese people have two virtues: diligence and thrift. These two virtues are like two sharp knives that can defeat any nation in the world. The success of Chinese overseas, who travel to various countries without relying on government power, is due to this reason. However, this success is limited to individuals, not to society and the country, because two sharp knives cannot ultimately defeat modern artillery. The most powerful modern artillery is social organization. It can shoot far, attack strongly, and destroy enemies without leaving a trace. We must forge 450 million sharp knives into a world-class artillery piece, and then we will not fear the demons of imperialism. To be more specific, what is this artillery? It is economic construction, or rather, national construction. A modern country must first have appropriate sea, land, and air forces; second, it must have sufficient steel, coal, and food; and third, it must have invincible laboratories and a large number of scientists. China is a country with the richest resources, but it has not yet become a modern country. In the past few decades, we can say that we were "begging for food with a golden bowl in our hands." Now it is different. We have been awakened by the enemy's clutches, and the time has come for "brothers to quarrel at home and resist insults from outside." Regardless of central or local, party affiliation or faction, we must embark on the path of a modern country. The path to a modern country requires economic construction to be completed. Economic construction requires a lot of capital. We are not afraid. As long as there are no more internal conflicts, the combined financial resources of the country will be substantial, not to mention that we have many resources that can be mortgaged for foreign investment. Economic construction also requires a large number of talents. We are not afraid either. As long as everyone does not engage in internal strife, those so-called "reactionary" elements can become positive. In the past ten years, many young people with passion and ambition sacrificed themselves in political struggles due to emotional excitement and insufficient understanding. I feel that this responsibility should not be borne by the young people themselves. Young people are full of emotion and ambition. They are like a blank sheet of paper, which becomes blue when dyed with blue and yellow when dyed with yellow. This responsibility should be borne by people in society who have leadership positions. I recall a story from my middle school days. Mr. Sun Shengwu, the principal of Liaoning Commercial Middle School, gave excellent guidance to the students. It is worth learning from. When Sino-Japanese relations were strained in the fourth year of the Republic of China, the call to boycott Japanese goods was very enthusiastic. As a result, some emotionally excited students at the commercial school burned Taiwanese straw hats (Japanese goods) worth ten or twenty yuan each and bought sorghum straw hats for three copper coins each to wear on their heads (to show their determination to boycott Japanese goods. One day, everyone was running around in the courtyard, proudly. Mr. Sun, the principal, saw this group of students in such strange shapes and was deeply puzzled. So he summoned them to the principal's office and asked them the reason. The students talked eloquently about how the country had reached this point, how they should be frugal, and how they should boycott Japanese goods, giving a lot of grand speeches. Mr. Sun looked at them carefully, one by one in silk shirts and satin shoes, and then asked with a smile, "Why are you so generous to your feet and bodies, but so stingy to your heads?" (This is Mr. Sun's original sentence). Only then did the students blush and retreat silently. The next day, the sorghum straw hats disappeared, and everyone bought a wheat straw hat to wear. If Principal Sun had thundered and severely criticized the students at that time, the students would not have been convinced, and the result might have been a disturbance, with several students being expelled. But that group of students are now the backbone of society. If they had been expelled from school, they might not have achieved what they have today. Therefore, the motives of young people are pure, but their emotions are particularly strong, and they often go to extremes. The gentlemen in society who bear leadership responsibilities must have the same benevolence and understanding as Mr. Sun and not label young people with the word "reactionary." Although these words may seem like nonsense, they are not without some relevance when discussing economic construction and national unification. (To be continued)

### Yarn and Cotton

Yarn Sales Mediocre, Short Sellers Active in Cotton Yarn

Violent Afternoon Decline, Trading Floor Loosened Significantly

Some Merchants Maintained a Lighter Falling Trend This Month

The yarn market is becoming sluggish, and the decline is intensifying. The reason is that American cotton has been rising for days, but yesterday the rise subsided slightly, and Osaka's Three Brands yarn rebounded and fell. According to the market, the US President has talked about limiting high prices, so short sellers have been active. At the same time, spot yarn sales are mediocre and weak. The market sentiment loosened, and sellers took the opportunity to suppress prices, causing the market to decline. However, a merchant in the industry adopted a strategy of buying on dips and bought 2,500 bales alone in the early afternoon of this month, slightly supporting the bearish sentiment.

Far-Dated Yarn Fell by More Than Two Yuan

In the forward market, the opening of the standard yarn market showed signs of decline in each month. The reason is that American cotton and Three Brands yarn have risen for many days and are showing signs of a rebound and decline. In addition, short covering was particularly heavy in the afternoon of the previous day. Yesterday, the trading floor loosened, so the market sentiment turned down. At the same time, spot yarn transactions were not very strong. The market opened lower and continued to fall. As a result, the closing price of each month's standard yarn fell by six dimes to one yuan and one dime compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a sharp decline, with the trading floor loosening significantly, and selling pressure increased sharply. Fortunately, a speculator bought 2,800 bales at the market price this month, and the decline was only three dimes. However, it was difficult to support the far-dated prices, and they fell sharply by one yuan and two dimes. Rumors spread in the market that the US President had news of restricting high prices. As a result, sellers surged in like a tide, and the Three Brands yarn fell by four yuan and three dimes to five yuan and a half. However, some people covered their short positions on dips. As a result, each month's price fell by another six dimes to one yuan and two dimes compared to the morning closing price. The sales records show: Tongji 2,950 bales, Yudai 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 3,450 bales, Yuanyi 2,000 bales, Yongda 1,100 bales, Mingde 1,100 bales, Dachang 1,550 bales, and Xincheng 4,250 bales were sold. Hengyi 1,500 bales, Dafeng 1,050 bales, Taixing 1,400 bales, Changfeng 8,000 bales, Renfeng 1,550 bales, Yicheng 1,900 bales, Taichang 2,000 bales, and Shengyuan 1,700 bales were bought. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Prices Also Fell

Spot yarn sales were mediocre. Statistics show that various merchant groups bought a total of 1,095 bales throughout the day. The selling price fell by five dimes to one yuan. The purchase amounts of various merchant groups are listed below.

Yarn Trading Suspended for Tomb Sweeping Festival

The Standard Yarn and Cotton Market of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange will be closed on March 26, 27, and 29 for the Tomb Sweeping Festival. The Exchange will be closed for these three days. From the 22nd, all commission payments to brokers will be temporarily made with term bills dated March 30. Term bills will be collected and paid as usual from the 30th.

Yarn Trading Halted Early This Month

The settlement date for standard yarn and cotton for March is now scheduled to be held on the 30th of this month. Because this month falls on the Tomb Sweeping Festival, the 26th has already been closed. All yarn and cotton transactions for this month will only be done until the 24th. The market will be closed on the settlement date.

American Cotton Rises Slightly

Cotton Selling Pressure Suddenly Intense

The cotton market has fallen sharply. The atmosphere is volatile and uncertain, and people are in a state of confusion, with prices rising and falling suddenly, making it difficult to predict. Most people in Shanghai are bearish due to ample cotton stocks. However, Indian cotton prices are rising daily and have reached a peak in recent years. There are also some bulls who are optimistic and continue to buy. Therefore, the competition between the bulls and the bears is particularly fierce.

Standard Cotton Rebounds Slightly by Four to Five Dimes

In the forward market, the opening of the standard cotton market showed a downward trend in each month. The atmosphere suddenly changed. The reason is that American cotton has been rising sharply for a long time, and the rising trend has subsided slightly. There have also been some hedging sales in the South. Yesterday, the telegraphs showed mixed ups and downs, ranging from one to ten pounds. Osaka's Three Brands cotton also fell by six to seven dimes, and market sentiment was particularly weak. Market prices fell steadily. As a result, each month's price of standard cotton fell by one dime to three dimes compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation changed greatly at the afternoon opening. Sellers swarmed in like bees. Rumors spread in the market that American cotton was expected to rebound and fall. Three Brands cotton also fell by seven to eight dimes to one yuan and three dimes and a half. The market opened lower and continued to fall. As a result, each month's price fell by another one and a half dimes to two dimes compared to the morning closing price. Sales records show: Tongji 4,000 piculs, Meiji 4,000 piculs, Yichang 4,800 piculs, Runkang 1,100 piculs, Yudai 1,100 piculs, Xiecheng 5,200 piculs, Yongda 3,700 piculs, Xincheng 9,300 piculs, Gengfeng 2,800 piculs, Yuanyi 3,200 piculs were sold. Runkang 3,400 piculs, Jifeng 2,300 piculs, Dafeng 2,200 piculs, Mingde 3,300 piculs, Taichang 3,600 piculs, Changfeng 9,200 piculs, Changhe 2,800 piculs, Hengyi 2,600 piculs, Fukang 2,900 piculs, and Shengyuan 1,600 piculs were bought. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.

Spot Cotton Transactions are Ordinary

Cotton mills' demand has become quiet again, and there are no sources of supply.

Cotton Exchange Warehouse Cotton Stocks Decrease

Totaling 25,355 bales

The amount of cotton yarn in the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange warehouses, as of March 11, was: 22,025 bales of 10-count reverse-twist yarn, 990 bales of 16-count yarn, and 12,340 bales of 20-count yarn, totaling 25,355 bales.

American Cotton Returns Slightly After Rising

Southern Cotton Farmers Begin Hedging Sales

Spot Merchants Also Sell October

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with active trading. Due to good news from Liverpool, the spot cotton market was strong. Foreign merchants, brokers, and traders bought, and each month rose by 7 to 13 points. After a period of continuous rise, southern cotton farmers began to sell to hedge, and at the same time, a large number of bulls also engaged in reselling. The market fell sharply. Before the close, traders and short sellers bought, and there was a slight recovery. Spot merchants saw good trading in Germany and Italy, bought May, and sold October. Private estimates are that 800,000 bales of cotton have been sold. The closing was stable. Spot prices rose by 1 point, and futures prices rose by  points to falling 10 points. British spot cotton fell by 4 points, and futures rose by 3 or 4 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 11th).

According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 12th was: Bai Luoxi at 240 rupees, Aomula at 224 rupees, Pingguoer at 189 rupees 75, all down by half a rupee.

Correction: Yesterday, the "rise" in the monthly quotations in the British cotton table was mistakenly written as "fall." This is corrected.

Osaka Yarn and Cotton Fall Sharply Together

According to the Osaka telegram of the 12th, spot yarn fell by 1 to 10 yuan. 16-count Fanmian was 245 yuan, down 1 yuan. 20-count Jinyu was 263 yuan, down 2 yuan. 40-count Wuxing was 390 yuan, down 10 yuan. 42-count Zhizi was 393 yuan, down 2 yuan.

### Piece Goods

North China Tightens Anti-Smuggling Efforts

Northern Merchants Heavily Replenishing Cotton Cloth

Yesterday, the cloth market trended steadily. Spot goods of Eastern plain white cloth remained scarce, and selling prices remained unchanged. The supply and demand of coarse cloth, coarse twill, and fine twill from local factories was fairly balanced. The price of 18-pound "Racetrack" coarse cloth rose by 5 fen due to a shortage of supply from Hankou. The price of high-grade fine twill rose by 1 jiao per piece due to the recent increase in Eastern goods. Deep-ground printed cloth was out of stock, and the inventory in various factories was low. Merchants still replenished in small amounts, while the market for light-ground printed crepe satin, cretonne, floral cloth, and linen yarn was becoming increasingly popular. In particular, as North China tightened its anti-smuggling efforts, merchants' confidence increased. Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan have been replenishing heavily in recent days. In addition to printed goods, merchants in Tianjin have also been replenishing linen, plain silk, yellow drill, and khaki, with daily turnover exceeding 200 pieces. Among printed goods, those produced by Lun Chang and Shanghai No. 2 Factory were most popular. Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory reopened last month and is actively reorganizing internally. The gloss of its new products has improved compared to before. In the past two weeks, the three types of crepe satin, floral cloth, and cretonne have been ordered in a total of more than 1,000 boxes, and this street has absorbed a large amount. The sales volume of British Lun Chang goods has been increasing daily, with daily sales approaching 200 to 300 boxes. The momentum of low-grade bleached cloth is good in all directions. The price of products from Lun Chang, Qingfeng, and other factories has risen by 1 jiao per piece. Actual sales are weakest in Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Henan.

Flannel Already Transacted

Yesterday, the trade in woolen fabrics was particularly smooth. Among them, Western suit wool was the most popular. Major silk and satin shops had a great interest in women's color wool fabrics. Some customers have already transacted in flannel, and the market is quite strong. The price of Chinese Renli Tianma brand has risen by 2 jiao per yard in the past two or three days. This is because this year's spring is short, and the weather is turning hot, so purchasing began earlier than in previous years. The arrival of new goods is limited, and costs have increased, so prices have generally hardened. The Renli main factory has opened in Tianjin, and flannel sales in Shanghai have been mostly sold out. Telegrams from Tianjin indicate a shortage of goods, and the factory is waiting to weave and ship the goods to Shanghai, causing people's confidence to suddenly increase. Goods that were previously sold for 4 yuan and 5 jiao are now being sold for 4 yuan and 7 jiao and a half.

### Securities

"Nine-Six" Rises Again Due to Manipulation

Forward Contracts Rise to $9.90

Unified Bonds Fluctuate and Strengthen

Yesterday, the market conditions at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were slightly stronger, but the fluctuating trend has not yet subsided. Suddenly, "Nine-Six" experienced an unwarranted surge. According to actual reports, only a certain bank representative bought 1.5 million units for a certain client, while Siming [a company] indeed delivered 3 million units this time, but has not yet replenished them. Many in the market blindly follow suit, and retail investors drift with the tide. There is no shortage of those who speculate as bulls. Speculators raise prices on one hand and sell on the other, invisibly passing the risk to retail investors. This requires caution. Yesterday's developments: The opening in the morning was extremely stable, with most prices unchanged and a few slightly down by five fen or one jiao. In the second session, there was some buying of No. 54, and market sentiment slightly shifted, recovering about five fen or one jiao. The afternoon opening saw shorts slightly rolling over, and market conditions rose again by about one jiao. The closing was slightly erratic, but gains still outnumbered losses. Overall, it has not yet escaped the pattern of fluctuation and brewing. However, the unprofitable and unbacked "Nine-Six" rose by one jiao per session, with forward contracts rising by as much as two jiao and a half at the close. Large investors bought on one hand and sold on the other. The ebb and flow within this is slightly manipulated, and it is still nothing more than the old tricks played in previous years. The final market prices saw various government bonds recover by one jiao to three jiao, while "Nine-Six" alone surged by four jiao to five jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was 7.44 million yuan. A comparative table of the gains and losses and final results is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Finance

Foreign Exchange Mostly Swap Trading Yesterday

Chinese Merchants Lack Inflow and Outflow

Hong Kong Slightly Tightens U.S. Dollars

In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that London's "Big Cable" [British Pound] rose by 0.0625 for both near and far dates. New York silver was up 1.25, and forward silver prices in Montreal rose by 1.5 li and 4 li, respectively.

After the opening, although Chinese merchants were even quieter due to the closure of the gold market, foreign firms had an appetite for it. Therefore, although banks were tightening, HSBC's posted rates showed that British, American, and Japanese exchanges were flat, with only the French franc contracting by three "sheng ding" [centimes]. At this time, it was very peaceful. Later, banks' appetite became sluggish, with only the Chinese-Japanese Bank doing swap trades against each other. The noon market remained flat. Later, Hong Kong slightly tightened forward U.S. dollars, while British merchant banks had an appetite, so the trend was looser and easier to support. Foreign firms and outports still had U.S. dollar swaps. The final closing was the same as the previous close for both near and far dates. Chinese merchants lacked inflow and outflow, and banks mainly engaged in swaps. In general, Chinese merchant banks and Japanese banks were the most active. Small Luzon posted U.S. dollar swaps. The day's transactions are recorded below:

British exchange: The morning opening near-term selling price was one shilling, two pence, six two five. China-Italy sold to foreign firms six-month at 5.3125 and 5.625 on the "da da" style trades.

### Grain

Xinzha Rice Market Slightly Improves

Yesterday, 278 boats arrived at the various routes of Zhabei. The market transactions for various goods were sluggish. White japonica rice prices were slightly down by a few fen, while thin indica rice showed a soft trend. Sheep Duport customers' demand also appeared weak, and all other goods were weak. However, the retail business of white japonica rice slightly improved in the afternoon market, and the price showed a trend of stabilizing amidst weakness. Today, because of the funeral of Director Qiang of the North City Rice Industry Association, all rice shops will be closed for one day.

### North-South Goods

Golden Fungus Production Price Drops by Two Yuan

Recently, the demand for golden needle mushrooms from various regions has been low and inactive, and the trend is weak. According to news from Zhenjiang yesterday, the production price has also eased. Yesterday, more than one hundred pieces were offered, down by two yuan compared to before. The future market may have to be further adjusted slightly. The local market prices have also followed suit. After this easing, sales in various regions may be activated as a result.

### Silk and Tea

Shanghai Silk Presents a Standoff

New York Spot and Futures Prices Differ

Yokohama Silk Market Remains Stable

Yesterday, the overseas silk market in New York showed discrepancies. The stock exchange market reacted with a decline. Near-term fell by 5.5 points, and futures fell by 4.5 points. However, silk merchants' holding prices remained firm, such as Japanese silk at 83 points and 75 points, and Chinese silk at 78 points. Yesterday's prices were up by 4 points compared to the previous day. Therefore, it is known that the New York silk market rose due to speculation and then fell back from the high. Recently, the Yokohama silk market has been quite stable. Although it was not as sharp as the New York surge a few days ago, yesterday, the market sentiment was also able to maintain the status quo. The spot price remained unchanged, while futures fell slightly by three yuan. However, the local foreign firms' silk trading has turned into a standoff, resulting in little trading. On the user side, in addition to white filature silk, Sichuan and Shandong factories have also sold, and the prices are quite firm and stable.

Qimen Tea Industry Will Soon Take the Stage

There are more than 200 tea factories in Qimen, Fuliang, Zhizhi and other places that produce black tea. Last year's business ended with most of them making a profit. This year, merchants from all over the country are still feeling excited about their business. Recently, they have been buying lead tea boxes, charcoal, and various equipment. The Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee also plans to send personnel to the mountains next week to negotiate loans. It is heard that for the sake of unified production and sales, the committee has agreed to change all the cooperatives that borrowed from the Bank of Communications last year to be lent by the committee. There are also considerable restrictions on past debts and weak foundations.

### Oil Market

Counterfeit Hongjiang Tung Oil Cracked Down On

Originally a Mixture of Oil Residue and Rosin

Hongjiang tung oil should have been selling well in the spring, but this year's arrivals have not been smooth, and there is a trend of demand exceeding supply, resulting in the discovery of a counterfeit Hongjiang tung oil on the market. The manufacturing site is being investigated. It is reported that the Wuxi Police Department cracked down on a counterfeit tung oil factory in Ronghu Village, Beitang on the 8th of this month. The raw materials were found to be a mixture of various oil residues, lime, and rosin. There was absolutely no tung oil scent. Each barrel was only sold for fourteen or fifteen yuan. The local tung oil industry then learned that the counterfeit oil came from Wuxi. However, it is also seen in Shanghai, and it is feared that there may be similar organizations secretly manufacturing it in this port. It is intended to request the authorities to conduct a strict investigation and ban it. Currently, various genuine and secondary brand Hongjiang tung oils have arrived in Shanghai one after another. Genuine brand Jichanghe sells for 48.8 yuan per barrel, Jiyingfeng sells for 48 yuan, and Dachangfeng sells for 47 yuan. Jifengying, Yang Hengyuan, Qingyuanfeng, Liu Tongqing, Xu Rongchang, and Xiao Hengqing's six brands all sell for 44.6 yuan. Xiushan tung oil Wanxingyu brand sells for 59.8 yuan, Jifengheng sells for 59 yuan, Jitaiheng sells for 57.6 yuan, and Jiqingheng sells for 50.04 yuan. The above market prices are all based on the initial prices this spring. The current market seems to have little change. However, according to a report from Hankou, due to the high price of white tung oil, the cost of Xiushan oil such as Wanxingyu must be 62 yuan, and Jifengheng must be 61 yuan. Therefore, the future market situation is likely to trend upwards again.

### Hardware

White Iron Sheet Hoarders Suddenly Begin Collecting

Since the new year, the price of East White Iron has been declining step by step due to the emergence of hoarders. For example, three-foot six-inch sheets are only offered at 1.15 yuan per sheet, and three-foot seven-inch sheets are offered at 1.4 yuan, a drop of more than one jiao compared to the end of last year. Recently, the selling prices of white lead and black iron sheets have risen sharply one after another, while the price of white iron remains the same. Therefore, many financially wealthy firms have paid attention. Yesterday, overseas, due to white lead being a military raw material, there was news of a halt to exports. Local hoarders heard this news, so they greatly purchased white iron sheets that had been cheap for many days, reaching more than 100,000 sheets. As a result, the circulation of goods was greatly lacking, and the market price immediately rose. Yesterday, the highest price for six-foot sheets was 1.3 yuan, and for seven-foot sheets, it was 1.48 yuan. It is heard that fellow traders and manufacturers are unwilling to sell easily.

Our Factory's Round Nails Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell

Our factory's round nails have recently been affected by the factory's offering price of 13.5 yuan, which is more than one yuan higher than before. Hoarders, seeing the high price, took the opportunity to sell, but the transaction was not active, resulting in a very leisurely trend. Yesterday, due to Hankou customers' urgent need to unload, the standard market price was dragged down by them. The current market price is 12.75 yuan, down by 7.5 jiao compared to before. It is heard that only six or seven hundred barrels were traded.

### Preparation Methods for Income Tax Declaration Forms (8)

— Pan Shihao

(3) Business Firm's Report Form for Receiving Deposits (Continued)

(5) Remarks and Date of Filing: The date of filing is the date of filing this form. The matters filled in on this form must be the facts at the time of filing. As for the remarks section, any points that need to be declared in addition to the above-mentioned items should also be noted as necessary. From a legal point of view, there are approximately two points that should be declared in the remarks section: (1) Deposits that are legally exempt from income tax. According to the provisions of Article of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the interest income from deposits of government agencies at all levels, statutory savings of civil servants and laborers, and foundation deposits of educational and charitable organizations or groups are exempt from income tax. Educational savings with annual interest income of less than one hundred yuan are also exempt from income tax. According to Article 5 of the Draft Collection Notice for Securities Deposit Income Tax of the Third Category, foundation deposits belonging to educational and charitable organizations or groups should use the name of the organization or group, and the deposit-receiving institution should report it to the local competent collection agency when receiving the deposit. The deposits filled in on this form should seem to include this type of deposit, then in the remarks section, the contents should be noted at the same time, and the depositor should jointly fill in the Tax Exemption Application Form for Foundation Deposits of Educational and Charitable Organizations and Groups and the Tax Exemption Application Form for Educational Savings, etc., together with the business firm receiving the deposit, to provide a detailed tax exemption application. (2) Transactions between the same firm or its branches. According to Article 4 of the Draft Collection Notice for Securities Deposit Income Tax of the Third Category, loans from banks and money shops and transactions between money industry firms or their branches may be exempt from interest income tax. As for commercial firms other than the money industry, there are no tax exemption regulations for transactions between the same industry in the law, but transactions can be settled and paid. Its nature is different from those that are limited to settlement (that is, deposit) and cannot be overdrawn (that is, overused). According to the legal principle that it is not tax-exempt, it should seem to be filled in on this form. In view of the nature of being different from ordinary deposits, it should be noted in the remarks section. Currently, the social aspect is requesting tax exemption for the income from this transaction interest. In addition, for transactions between branches other than money shops, if the capital of this branch is not divided or the business is not completely independent, according to Article 6 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 2 of the Draft Collection Notice for Income from First Category Business Undertakings, the income from the first category business undertaking can be reported jointly. Then, according to the legal principle, the interest on transactions between this branch should also seem to be exempt from income tax. This type of transaction does not need to be filled in on this form, but it must be noted in the remarks section.

(4) Report Form for Deduction of Income Amount for Second Category Salaries and Remuneration (with List)

Article 1 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations lists the income of public officials, freelancers, and others engaged in various occupations' salaries and remuneration as the second category of income tax. Its name is Income Tax on Salaries and Remuneration. The collection method for this type of income tax from freelancers and others engaged in various occupations can be divided into two types: self-payment and withholding. Self-payment means that the taxpayer, that is, the recipient of the income, calculates their income amount and the tax amount payable themselves, and reports and pays their income tax to the local competent collection agency. Withholding means that the income-paying institution or employer calculates on behalf of them, and deducts the income tax payable, to report and pay it to the local competent collection agency on their behalf. According to Article 27 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, those belonging to the second category shall be withheld by the head of the institution or the employer who directly pays the salary or remuneration, and those without a paying institution or employer shall pay it themselves. Furthermore, according to the provisions of Article 17 of the same Detailed Rules, in calculating the income of freelancers and others engaged in various occupations, their corresponding expenses can be deducted first, and the remaining amount is the income amount. Article 8 of the Draft Collection Notice for Second Category Salary and Remuneration Income Tax says that the expenses that can be deducted according to the provisions of Article 17 of the Implementing Rules are limited to those who have a business office. It can be seen that for those who have a business office, their income tax should be self-paid, and the payer shall not deduct it on their behalf. The second category of income tax that the paying institution or employer should deduct on their behalf is limited to those who do not have a business office. This form and its attached list are the declaration forms used by institutions or employers with withholding responsibilities to report and pay the income tax they have withheld. Since income tax is of a withholding nature, the taxpayer and the income tax reporter should each be a different person. The term freelancers, such as accountants, lawyers, doctors, and engineers, are all examples. The term others engaged in various occupations has a very wide scope, and all general employed people in society who are not freelancers belong to it. And the employees of industrial and commercial firms are especially an important part of it. The levy of income tax has exceeded two months. It is heard that few commercial firms have reported and paid the second category of income tax. Is it because the preparation method of this form is not yet clear? Speaking in the spirit of being law-abiding, it seems that it cannot be delayed any longer. The preparation method of this form is explained below.

Before explaining the preparation method of this form, there is one more question that must be explained first, that is, this form has two parts: a report form and a list. This list is called the Withholding List for Income Tax of Freelancers and Others Engaged in Various Occupations. Examining its nature, it is a detailed list. According to the provisions of Article 17 of this category of Tax Payment Notice, the amount of income tax on salaries and remuneration is calculated according to the attached table, and this attached table is the list. Therefore, the reporting and payment of this category of income tax should first prepare a detailed list of the nature of the withholding list. Then, based on this list, list its total amount on the report form. The preparation method of the list is explained first:

(1) Month: Article 7 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations states that the second category of income, whether calculated monthly or annually, shall be taxed based on the monthly average calculation. For income that is not regular or temporary, the income tax shall be calculated based on the income amount for each month. It can be seen that the withholding calculation of this category of income tax is based on the month as a unit. Furthermore, Article 26 of its Implementing Rules states that the second category of income tax shall be paid monthly. Article 18 of the Tax Payment Notice states that the head of each institution or each employer shall, when issuing salaries and remuneration each month, deduct the income tax payable separately and submit it monthly. It can also be seen that the reporting and payment of this category of income tax should be done monthly. The "monthly" as interpreted by the law seems to be those issued each month. It should be reported and paid within the following month. The month of this list should be the month of payment of this income tax. It can of course be compared with the date of filing recorded in the income amount report form described below. For example, if the list is for February, then the date of filing of the report form should be within March.

(2) Name of Taxpayer: The taxpayer is the one with the tax obligation, and their name should be filled in one by one. According to Article 2 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the second category of income that averages less than thirty yuan per month is exempt from income tax. Therefore, the names of taxpayers that should be filled in on the list are limited to those whose average salary and remuneration income reaches thirty yuan or more. If the amount of their salary is fixed, that is, the amount they should have received this month is above twenty yuan, but due to lack of work, the actual amount of income this month is less than thirty yuan, they should also pay tax. Their names should also be filled in on the list. All compensation for injuries or deaths in the line of duty for military and police officers, elementary school teachers' salaries, disability benefits, labor and livelihood support for the powerless, pensions, alimony, etc. are legally exempt from income tax and do not need to have their names filled in on the list. When freelancers and others engaged in various occupations who have a business office are paid salaries and remuneration, there is no need to deduct income tax on their behalf, and they are not included in this list.

Women's Special Edition

### The Revised Concept of Beauty That Modern Women Should Have

— Huai Bing

—— Replacing Beauty of Appearance with Beauty of Health

—— Replacing Beauty of Adornment with Beauty of Spirit

Loving beauty is human nature, and women especially value beauty as their second life. Unfortunately, Chinese women's concept of beauty is too lacking in correctness. They think that as long as a woman has a beautiful face, a beautiful appearance, and a beautiful face, she is a beauty; they think that a beauty's body must be "too weak to withstand the wind" to show a graceful posture, and "melancholy and sickly" to be touching and lovable. This deformed aesthetic concept has weakened the physique of many women and sacrificed the health of many women. Modern women must not repeat this historical mistake and inherit this deformed aesthetic concept. They should replace the deformed beauty of appearance with the balanced beauty of health. There is also the famous saying in Europe and America, "Although there is a beautiful face, it is not as good as a beautiful posture," and a beautiful posture is based on a healthy body, so a modern woman should recognize the importance of this beauty of health.

Furthermore, Chinese women have always had this old saying, such as "Buddha needs gold clothing, and people need clothes" and "Three points of talent, seven points of dress," thinking that as long as a woman's clothes are beautiful, regardless of whether her stomach is full of grass, or how base her personality is, how decadent her spirit is, or how mediocre her thoughts are, she will always be a beauty. This concept of beauty is even more wrong, and the harm is greater than the above. Modern new women should thoroughly eliminate this poisonous concept, pay attention to the greatness of their personality, the nobility of their spirit, and the progress of their thoughts. Women are not vases, women are not playthings, women are not just for men to appreciate. Women are also a part of humanity, and they also have responsibilities and obligations to the country and society. Therefore, modern new women should strive for production like Soviet women and be proud of receiving government medals, and can no longer specialize in decoration!

### Soviet Women and the Family

— Shou Zhen

Weak, with a weak will, only fit to have children, and do kitchen work. This old concept of women is common throughout the world. However, in Soviet Russia, this old concept, this unreasonable prejudice, has been completely broken! From the day of the Soviet revolution, women were given complete political and economic rights, and the women who were given these rights flocked to productive enterprises together.

Now, we only need to look at those Soviet female shock brigade members, collective farm representatives, female scholars, female civil servants, female parachutists, female drivers, and women who have shouldered the most important responsibility of "motherhood" and strived for true equality and true freedom, and we can fully understand how the power of women is being expressed in this emerging country!

Until today, women in the world are still wandering and struggling in the voices of fighting for political and social status and returning to the kitchen. In the Soviet Union, these two paths are unfolding without difference. They definitely don't need to wander, let alone struggle. In fact, although they have gained social status, they have not left the family. The revolutionary leaders of the Soviet Union also regard the family as the foundation of social organization, but their family is not an economic unit, but a biological and social unit. The gap between the family and society has been broken, and they are interconnected.

Moreover, because of the rapid development and stability of the social economy, accompanied by the increase in personal freedom, personal responsibility has also increased. In the past, the ease and carelessness of divorce, marriage, and raising children in the early days of the revolution have now been restricted. Recently, the Soviet Union promulgated divorce regulations. The first divorce costs 50 rubles for both parties, the second costs 150, and the third costs 300, and it must be done with the court's approval. Although this is not a major reform, it can at least show a new trend in stabilizing society, and it is said that this new law is highly approved by Soviet young men and women.

Stalin once requested that each family should have ten or more people. Families with many people can receive government subsidies. This is the same as Germany's policy of encouraging production. In the Soviet Union, rural families have more people, and cities often limit the increase in the number of people due to the lack of housing. This has caused concern and anxiety to the authorities, because in the vast territory of Siberia, many schools, new factories, and countless mineral resources need to be established and are waiting to be developed. They need people, they need a large number of laborers.

In order to encourage the increase in the family population, nurseries and kindergartens are also being increased. However, many female workers with higher wages and richer lives do not want to send their children to public places to raise them, but prefer to keep them at home. The most strange thing is that most Soviet women like to have children. They are all female engineers, female doctors, female professors, etc. who have received higher education. They say, "Why shouldn't we have children after marriage!"

From this, we can see that even countries that advocate world revolution and socialism have not abandoned the family. At the same time, we can also see that a woman who has truly gained personal status and independence has not left the family. The liberation of women is not just a matter of getting rid of the family, and the family and the kitchen themselves are not the shackles or constraints of women!

### Walking on Thin Ice

### Spring's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Wang Shouqiu

Spring Girl has already descended to the human world amidst the cheers of the masses! She brings a gentle spring breeze; she brings a warm sun; people, receiving her blessing, will find their spirits revitalized; plants, receiving her blessing, will all sprout their green shoots; birds, receiving her blessing, will feel even more active; the earth is filled with the essence of spring.

Spring Girl has arrived! The climate has also changed because of Spring Girl's arrival! All aspects of people's lives, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, are naturally different from the harsh winter. But what kind of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are appropriate for spring? We might as well discuss it, as reference material for housewives.

Let's start with clothing: Spring clothes should be loose-fitting. The tight clothes of winter are not suitable. Especially for children, spring is the time of their development, and if their clothes are too small, it will hinder their growth. This is something that housewives should pay attention to.

Next is the aspect of food: In spring, it is not advisable to continue consuming tonics. Spicy and dry foods, such as pepper, scallions, and garlic, should also be eaten in moderation, because green vegetables are the best food in spring due to the heating in winter. More fruits and water can also be eaten. Especially green radishes, buy some for the children to eat often.

Regarding the issue of housing: In spring, houses should be spacious, and the air should be circulated; it is best to absorb as much fresh air as possible. The furnishings in the house should not be too crowded; they should be sparse to be suitable. Place a few pots of flowers and plants on the desk, because flowers and plants can regulate people's spirits.

As for transportation? It is best to walk more and not use any means of transportation; one can exercise, and the other can enjoy the spring scenery and fresh air. Parks and fields are good places in spring. Housewives with children can take their children there several times.

Finally, please pay attention, housewives: absolutely do not use heating in spring.

### Seventh Letter

— (Zhuo Dai)

Ms. B,

I will now fulfill my previous agreement and explain to you the advantages and disadvantages of the three types of gardens: Chinese, European and American, and Japanese.

The Chinese painted-style garden is a special style that can stand on its own, apart from the landscape garden (Japanese style) and the architectural garden (European and American style). In particular, the nine-turn bridge and the long corridor can be praised by landscape architects around the world: but there are also shortcomings. Often there are too many houses, and the area of the houses is almost the same as the outdoor area. This allocation is unacceptable. Modern people, for the sake of health, pay attention to the outdoors, and call the open air an outdoor room, and advocate that people rest more outdoors, so too many houses are too far from the modern people's purpose of building a garden. We should reduce the number of houses in Chinese gardens and increase the number of outdoor rooms. Also, the rockeries piled with Taihu stones have a unique flavor; it is not necessary to have winding rockery caves, so that tourists can play like snail shells. It must be known that the purpose of a garden is for recuperation, do not make tourists too miserable.

The Japanese-style landscape garden, also known as the natural style, has very few buildings, and everything is arranged to look very natural, especially the construction of mountains, which are different from rockeries, and look completely like real mountains, but there are also shortcomings. Often the trees are too close to the house, regardless of indoor sunlight and air, and the hygiene is very bad. Also, there are only landscapes to be viewed from above and landscapes to be viewed from afar, and there are no landscapes to be viewed from below. Therefore, Europeans and Americans criticize Japanese gardens and call them the art of the feet.

As for the European and American architectural gardens, they have very sufficient sunlight and air, and the sanitary conditions are very satisfactory. Parks are the most suitable, and individual gardens can only be used if they have a large area. The disadvantage is that there are too few houses, and some even have no houses, so there must be some places to avoid the hot sun and wind and waves. The trees are all shaped and cut into squares and cones, which is too unnatural, similar to the Chinese tying pines and cypresses into cranes. People in the city need nature very much, and we must use gardening to make people in the city close to nature.

The above three types each have their own advantages and disadvantages. How should we use his strengths? Avoid his shortcomings? How should we put all kinds of strengths together, and how should we reconcile these three different natures? In a Chinese-style house, how to match an architectural garden so that the interest does not conflict? Can a Western-style house be matched with a natural or painted garden, and still be very harmonious? These are all difficult problems, and it all depends on how the landscape architect thinks and uses them.

Recently, the tendency of Chinese people is that they are not very interested in the Chinese-style gardens of pavilions and pavilions, and the European and American-style whole-form gardens like a lawn seem to be difficult to satisfy, so they feel that the Japanese-style natural style has a unique flavor. Therefore, in recent years, Chinese gardens are often built by Japanese people, which is the reason.

Japanese gardening was originally brought from China in ancient times, so there are many poetic and artistic elements; however, they cannot have such great buildings as China, so they all think from the open air, and then add some Japanese flavor to it, and extremely imitate nature, so that it becomes what it is today, and the source is still the same. According to their method, the cost is extremely low, so more people learn from them.

### Man Eats Man

— Youlan

"This world is really getting worse and worse!" Bo Xin sighed and shook his head repeatedly to Jisheng, "Didn't you see that Old Zhou, who had been working in the company for eight or nine years, was eaten alive by Old Yu?"

He slapped the table hard with his hand, seeming to contain a belly of anger and injustice in addition to his emotion.

"What? Man eats man?" Jisheng asked in surprise.

"You don't know about this?"

"Old Yu is a sinister ghost, everyone knows that: but Old Zhou's resignation, isn't it rumored to be because the head of the cashier's office was messing with him?" Jisheng said.

Bo Xin suddenly pushed away his chair, jumped up and stomped his feet and said:

"Ah! It's just that Officer Wen was fooled by Old Yu! For half a year, Old Yu relied on his ability to walk silently like a venomous snake and never open his mouth, and actually entangled Officer Wen so much that he was dizzy and regarded him as a confidant. So Old Yu kept saying bad things about Old Zhou, while taking over all the power of the collection section, making Old Zhou not only a bare-handed section chief with no real power, but also regarded as an enemy by Officer Wen, and finally had to leave."

Jisheng was really annoyed when he heard this.

"I originally said that Old Yu is not a good person! Some people see that his clothes are old and worn, and he is as stingy as his life, sitting in the writing room and always looking at his nose and his heart, and call him a saint, and he also poses as a saint; in fact, he is the mother of a saint, he is a saint, and even the traitor Hu Lifu can be paired to enjoy the two corridors!"

"Isn't it? A person like Old Zhou, who is not bad in qualifications and capable, was actually eaten alive by Old Yu. His ability is probably not comparable to that of a saint!" Bo Xin said.

"I saw that Old Yu was willing to give his life to do anything, no matter how small, and his skin was thicker than anyone else. When people had something to contact the collection section, he always rushed up to greet them like he was grabbing food; I knew he had bad intentions towards Old Zhou, and now he has really done it!" Saying that, he also sighed heavily: "Alas! Man eats man! It's really impossible to live in this day and age!"

"The more developed material civilization is, the more intense human competition is. I'm afraid that there will be no less of this kind of man-eat-man activity in the future?" Bo Xin really felt infinitely emotional.

### Beriberi Patients

— Zishi

In the place where I used to work, there was a colleague named Chen. He was tall and lanky, with a hunched back and a swollen face, which was very unsightly, so someone gave him the nickname "Frankenstein." It turned out that this Chen was suffering from beriberi, and because his illness became more and more serious, his legs swelled, and he left his job and returned to his hometown. When he went back, he also heard others say that the disease was due to the soil and water, and that he would get better when he returned to his hometown. But later news came that Chen died of the disease after all!

This year, one of my relatives is also suffering from beriberi. I am secretly worried about him! However, he asked the doctor and learned that beriberi is caused by a lack of vitamin B in the body, and the doctor advised him to take vitamin B preparations of the new drug "Bede Ming" early. After my relative took the medicine, the illness gradually subsided, and after taking several bottles, he is now completely cured. Seeing the joy of my relative made me unable to help but think of Chen's miserable life. However, "Bede Ming" is the latest product of Wuzhou Pharmacy. If it had been produced earlier and given to Chen, he would not have lost his life.

### The "Yugu Village" Incident

— Xiao Mei

The squatter settlement problem has not yet been resolved, and now there is the "Yugu Village" incident.

I don't think I need to dwell on the details of the "Yugu Village" incident, readers of the newspaper must understand it better than I do. Here, I want to write about some of my personal thoughts on this incident. My thoughts are very plain, not surprising at all, but these plain thoughts will belong to every Chinese citizen.

As a certain legal scholar said, "The Shanghai Municipal Council's construction of roads outside the settlement has no legal basis and in fact infringes on sovereignty; and it is illegal to collect donations and taxes from households outside the settlement; now it is even more unreasonable to block traffic because residents refuse to pay donations and taxes!" Such an unreasonable act coming from the "civilized" Shanghai Municipal Council, which is responsible for maintaining law and order, makes people feel that there is nothing to say.

The reason cited by the Shanghai Municipal Council, as guessed by a certain legal scholar, is "because the residents of that area have not paid donations and taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the traffic is blocked, and the residents of that area are not allowed to walk." Such a ridiculous and shallow view, if it can be used as a "reason" to "cut off the connection with the Shanghai Municipal Council's drainage ditches and the direct traffic on Yuyuan Road, Difeng Road, and Jing'an Temple Road," then the Shanghai Municipal Council should have built walls at the places where the settlement and the Chinese area meet long ago, and even not allow residents living in the Chinese area to enter the settlement. But may I ask, can this become a reason, is this possible?

Let's not talk about the fact that the settlement is Chinese territory; nor will we discuss who should have administrative power in the area where roads are built beyond the settlement. Even taking a step back, let's say that residents in the area where roads are built beyond the settlement who have not paid donations and taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council are not allowed to set foot on the roads built by the Shanghai Municipal Council, or cannot enjoy the drainage ditches built by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Let's assume that this statement is "reasonable," then may I ask, why have the residents of Yugu Village, who have paid donations and taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council, also suffered from the disruption of traffic! Moreover, the property tax has been in arrears for 35,000 yuan. This fact has not been known in a short period of time. Why didn't the Shanghai Municipal Council use legal procedures to deal with the non-payment of property tax at the beginning, and wait until the arrears amounted to 35,000 yuan before suddenly resorting to such an unreasonable act of interfering with residents' freedom!

The citizens of the Republic of China are under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. The Shanghai Municipal Council always has such basic common sense. The Shanghai Municipal Council does not negotiate with the Chinese government and resolutely implements such an unreasonable act, which not only commits the mistake of disrupting law and order by those who maintain law and order, but also insults the Chinese nation too much!

We do not want to suggest what strong methods to use to deal with this act, but we do hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will restore its conscience, immediately remove all obstacles, connect the drainage ditches, and let the Chinese government solve all the problems, so as to avoid triggering even bigger incidents. However, under such principles, there is still one right to be preserved, that is, to compensate the residents for their losses this time.

I hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council can rationally consider this issue, and stop making shallow and ridiculous actions that make people ridicule, and please pay attention to what kind of righteous indignation the Chinese citizens have already aroused about this matter?

### Dusk

— Lan Pei

I love dusk...

When the tired sun hides in the clouds, the western sky is dyed with beautiful, contemplative clouds. In the gray-blue sky, flocks of birds begin to chatter and hover, and occasionally, a pair or two of crows who love to be lively fly in from somewhere; however, they are not welcome, their blackness refuses the growth of friendship, and after croaking two or three times, they have no choice but to flap their long black wings and fly far away with a belly full of sadness... The forest and the fields are lightly covered with a veil, and far and near - slowly like a water stain spreading on blotting paper - a transparent night atmosphere that touches the tip of the nose and feels a bit cool diffuses... The green bushes shake out whispers in the gentle breeze, whispering in people's ears: like a mother's comfort, like a wife's consideration, like a lover's secret words...

In those moments, I love to walk alone, to the edge of the forest surrounded by the night atmosphere and into the embrace of the fields, and then I begin to meditate, I begin to have many beautiful and comforting dreams, I think of the freedom of the sea, the nobility of the eagle... Sometimes, the western sky is hazy, presenting a chaotic color like a half-ripe orange, the night wind gently blows people's temples, and nature uses its intoxicating solemnity to envelop the mother earth, and I suddenly want to write poetry, I want to sing out my joy, my soul, mixed with the beautiful scenery of nature...

...I grew up in a farmer's family, I have the rough and clumsy appearance of a farmer, and I also have the simple and undeveloped inner quality of a farmer, and even I often exhale the earthy breath of a farmer, but since I was a child, I have loved dusk the most... When I was a child, when I woke up from a nap in the grass or under the shade of a big tree, it was often when the sun had set, but I didn't think about going back. The curling smoke in the plain at the foot of the mountain, the beautiful and changing sunset in the western half of the sky, the yellow sunlight reflecting the sky and the earth through the clouds... All of this attracted me... I stayed foolishly on the hill, until - until the night clouds surged into the sky, and it began to get dark all around, and the dilapidated Big Dipper also lonely stepped out with the eyes of a hermit, and then I called out to my bleating sheep and drove them home. On the way home, on the long mountain road with fish ponds on both sides, I was often intoxicated by the music of nature. When listening to the clicking of frogs, the subtle chirping of crickets, and occasionally, the sound of fish lapping water and the splashing of water, my child's heart also softened into a poetic realm... Now, in the dim twilight, when I walk along a path in the wilderness near a few fish ponds, occasionally hearing the sound of fish lapping water or splashing

## Page 20

When I hear the sound of water, or occasionally hear a few sounds of lambs calling for their mothers, those familiar sounds make me remember my hometown as if I were seeing it, and I seem to have returned to my childhood, as if I were still watching the passing of dusk on the hill...

For wandering people, what else can evoke smiles besides relying on the memories of precious childhood? ...

Dusk is like poetry, hazy smoke is generally fascinating.

I love dusk...

### New Guests in the Inspection Station

— Tuoren

In the inspection station for new guests entering the port, there is not a day without new guests arriving. As long as a ship from Chinese territory docks, the inspection station, which can hold up to a thousand people, will be crowded with people.

The Xia Linan ship entered the port at dawn, and it was almost noon when it docked. A group of new guests from thousands of miles away, under the coercion of the Indian patrol officers' fists and clubs, walked into the waiting room of the inspection station. Although everything in the inspection station is the latest construction and the latest equipment, the row of houses specially for Chinese to wait for inspection is even more dilapidated and dirty than the most unsanitary and unimproved old-fashioned prisons. There was already a bit of an unpleasant odor, and then it was crowded with people who had just come up from the ship's hold with a special smell, and that unpleasant smell would often make people with weaker constitutions faint, and in this tropical noon, the sultry heat of the weather made the new guests even more painful.

Opposite the Chinese waiting room is a row of waiting rooms for new guests of other nationalities. Although there is a grass field in between, it can be seen very clearly from the iron door of the waiting room. Those waiting rooms are not only larger, but also particularly clean. The new guests inside are walking around so leisurely. Comparing that side with this side will show the difference between heaven and earth.

The inspectors are all white giants. They very leisurely checked the new guests of other nationalities one by one in the inspection room, as if those new guests had absolutely no diseases, and they passed by after looking around. Especially for those Japanese, they were even more respectfully let go. But when it came to checking the Chinese, the inspectors changed to another face, as if the Chinese were specific patients, and each one had to be checked all over their bodies. If you were a little slow when he asked you to remove your coat, a huge palm would be added to your face. If you have a small pustule on your body or your eyes are red, then he will push you aside and say that you are sick. But fortunately, when there is no inspection, some Chinese who work there will tell you that if you say you are sick, you can stuff the banknotes into the pocket of the supervisor next to you, and then you can pass even if you are sick, because the person who takes your banknotes will say to the inspector: "Check this one again." When they check for the second time, they will let you pass. Because of this lesson, when there is no inspection, the new guests have already prepared the banknotes, and if they say they are sick, they can do as the clerk said.

"Going to Nanyang," that is, only when there is no other way can they take this path, and most of them are people who have no way to live in the country and want to make a fortune overseas. Their dozens of dollars of boat fare and "entry tax," "body tax," and "registration tax" will cost more than a hundred dollars. In their environment, isn't more than a hundred dollars the blood and sweat money from selling family property or borrowing from the east and west and doing small business? Often when they arrive at the shore, they don't even have a penny left. Where do they get the banknotes to stuff to the supervisors? But as long as you are not sick, then you have to live in the re-examination room for a few days, but the place in the re-examination room is even dirtier than the waiting room. Even if you are not sick, you will get really sick from sitting there, then the unfortunate fate will come. Spending more than a hundred dollars is like throwing it into the sea without getting anything and being sent back to your homeland. This is the special fate and special treatment of Chinese new guests.

Autumn shadows sadly close the vermilion doors.  Elegant and refined, we think of Exploring Spring.  She, seeing the begonias, thinks of forming a society.  Personally flipping through the almanac to choose an auspicious day.  All the sisters in the garden are surprised.  Busybody Wen is overjoyed upon hearing this.  In a moment, she drafts the rules of the poetry society, and even calls the maids to invite the neighbors.  Suddenly, skirts flutter as they gather at the Yi Hong Courtyard.  In an instant.  Beautiful words like pearls, discussions in a frenzy.  Arguments over different titles last a long time.  Let other things be put aside, and accompany the poets.  Autumn begonias are valued for their white blossoms.  So, they will use this flower as the society's name.  The society's rules are decided, and everyone takes their seats.  Everyone searches their minds and deeply ponders.  Hengwu Jun's wonderful phrases are praised by the group.  The melancholic beauty of Xiaoxiang is unmatched.  Only Yi Hong is willing to come in last.  He is.  Intending not to compete with the daughters.  The sea peach blooms with a smile, even more charming.  Jade-like, upright, planted in a jade pot.  From then on.  The courtyard gate is quietly, soul-stealingly lonely.

Chen Ruilin's "Biographies of the Two Heroes"

Mingyuan (960) 1:15 PM to 2:00 PM

Opening: "Jia Baoyu Sneaks into Xiaoxiang Pavilion at Night"

Deep winter's cold fog congeals into ice. The moonlight dimly threatens to break one's soul. Gusts of north wind penetrate the bones.  In the pitch-black Grand View Garden, all is desolate and quiet.  Baoyu walks alone on the flower-lined path.  Late at night, no sound is heard.  He carries a lamp.  He is alone.  Dark shadows flicker as he walks forward.  All alone, he goes to Xiaoxiang Pavilion.  To see if Sister Lin's illness has lessened.  He gently knocks on the copper ring, the sound dripping.  Can someone quickly come to open the door?  Zijuan listens.  Asks a question.  Is it Baoyu who wishes to enter?  She hastily opens the door.  Please be careful, the cold of the late night shows no mercy.  Thank you, sister, for your concern.  I will never forget your great kindness.  It is only because I am worried about your Lin girl.  That is why I have come so late at night.  He arrives at the bedside.  He sees her panting and sobbing, tears streaming down her face.  One moment calling Lin Meimei.  The next calling him cousin.  Her almond eyes are half-open, unable to see clearly.  Cousin.  Your second sister-in-law treats me so harshly.  She speaks wildly and creates right and wrong.  Although the Old Ancestress loves me dearly.  I am sorry, I cannot go to greet her and wish her peace.  My past life's debt to you is settled in this life.  Please do not look at this ill-fated person any longer.  Sister, put aside all your worries.  Do not think too little of yourself.  I advise you to eat three meals a day.  Add more clothing to keep warm.  I advise you to sleep early and not stay up too late.  Drink more medicinal tonics.  I advise you not to listen to the sisters' words.  They are like false, like play, and also like truth.  I advise you to nurture your body and mind, and take care of yourself.  Do not think of your old home in Yangzhou again.  Hearing his words.  Tears streaming down.  My enemy, I will remember your words most carefully.  Cousin, please return to Yi Hong Courtyard early.  Tear-soaked the fragrant silk handkerchief.  Perhaps this body is not too desolate.

Walk, walk, walk, walk. Descend from the Jade Pavilion. Flowers planted beside the stairs, so pure and secluded. Flower pistils fragrant. Flower colors beautiful. The whole room is filled with fragrance, intoxicating the heart. Swallows before the curtain. Slender, drooping willows. Startle the butterfly's dream, ashamed of its tenderness. Flowers grow beautifully. Years linger long. Do not waste the great youth. Find your own happiness. Your own body. Your own freedom. I cry out for the people in the sea of suffering. I am forever refusing poison. Forever fighting.

Film

### Han Langan in "The General's Daughter"

In "The General's Daughter" directed by He Mengfu, Han Langan is a guard under a warlord. Because he was guarding a revolutionary party member (played by Li Qing), he was secretly released by the warlord's daughter (Li Zhuozhuo). As a result, he was punished and demoted to a groom in the military camp. After washing the horses every day, he squatted naked in a wooden basin to bathe himself. The resentment of life made him extremely hate the escaped revolutionary youth and vowed to find the youth to take revenge. As a result, the revolutionary youth finally suffered his sneak attack. However, he was later blamed by his conscience and quietly abandoned his post and left.

In "The General's Daughter," Han Langan is still a kind of joke, a kind of wretched and ridiculous character. However, the screenwriter and director created a life of flesh and blood for him.

### Star Magazine

"Crossroads" will be staged at the Nanjing National Grand Theater starting on the 18th of this month. Although the screening date in Shanghai has not yet been determined, it will generally be during the Spring Festival period in early April.

The "Gone with the Wind" which will be filmed soon, depicts the love tragedy of modern women being played and abandoned by men from the "May Fourth" era to modern times. Because there are several eras of changes, in order to grasp the authenticity of the scenery, props, and costumes, Gao Bu Xiao, "The Gentleman in the Attic" (taken from the film "New and Old Shanghai"), has been busy investigating and consulting in the Shanghai Local Records Office, the Times Newspaper Office, and the City God Temple Photo Studio these days.

Gong Jianong, one of the male protagonists of "Lively Dragons and Tigers," returned from Suzhou yesterday and said that the greatness of the bandit suppression scenes in "Lively Dragons and Tigers" has never been seen before and is enough to break the records of previous detective films. More than a thousand soldiers participated in the performance, and the officers enthusiastically supported it. The results were unexpectedly good. If the weather can continue to clear for four days, it can be completed satisfactorily.

### Shu Xiuwen and Xie Yunqing in "Lively Dragons and Tigers"

Cheng Bu Gao's "Dream World" has been smooth since its start, and nine scenes have been completed. The actors who play roles in this play have all tasted a bit of the taste of dreams, and they all say that there is indeed a universe in dreams, so they are very interested in the work.

"Street Angel" has been working intensively in recent days, often overnight, and can be completed within this month.

### Tragic and Enthusiastic "The Informer"

—Public Screening at the Nanjing Grand Theater—

"The Informer" shows the great historical fact of the "Easter Uprising" of the Irish people in 1916. The Irish people, taking advantage of the critical moment of the World War, suddenly raised the glorious banner of plowing stars. Under this banner are thousands of passionate men who rely on a passionate heart to seize the most precious freedom through bloodshed and revolution. The film is the greatest historical blockbuster of RKO Pictures in 1936. The protagonist is Bai Beilan Stanley, a female star in famous films such as "Mrs. Brown". The supporting actors include Bradenton Foster and all the actors of the world-renowned Abe Theater. It is heard that the tragic and revolutionary literary immortal blockbuster will be publicly screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater starting this week.
