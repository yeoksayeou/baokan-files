### Liu Zhi Arrives in Nanjing to Visit He Yingqin

Meets with Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, etc.　Discussing Steps to Consolidate Military Affairs in the Three Provinces

[Nanjing] Liu Zhi, chairman of the Military Reorganization Council of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, arrived in Nanjing from Bian on the morning of the 7th. He visited Minister He at noon to report and ask for instructions, and attended a banquet hosted by He. During the banquet, he and Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, Chen Jicheng, etc. discussed the principles for conducting military reorganization in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. According to Liu, this trip was to visit He for instructions and to meet with Yu, He, etc. He will stay in Nanjing for three or four days and then return to his defense area. The military reorganization meeting is scheduled to be held on the 12th. If it is not possible, it will be postponed. (7th Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Liu Zhi, director of the Henan-Anhui Pacification Headquarters and director of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Military Reorganization Committee, arrived in Nanjing by special train from Bian on the morning of the 7th. He went to visit Minister He to ask for instructions and plans to meet with Yu Shuchang, Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, etc. to discuss everything. It is said that Mr. Liu will stay in Nanjing for several days. The reporter, because Mr. Liu is responsible for presiding over the military reorganization of the three provinces, specially visited and asked about the future steps. He made the following remarks. Mr. Liu first adjusted the nature of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Military Reorganization Committee, which was originally the advisory body of the chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and was only responsible for making suggestions on reorganization. The steps for reorganization must be reported to the central government for handling. It is expected that the reorganization will start with the old Northeastern Army stationed in the three provinces, and other troops will be reorganized in order if it is deemed necessary. The old Northeastern Army originally belonged to the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Now that the headquarters has been abolished, it will be directly under the central government. The old Northeastern Army now has more than 100,000 troops. Its organization, personnel, and salary system are slightly different from those of the national army. In the future, we should gradually strive for uniformity and make it a strong national army. Mr. Liu continued that the Military Reorganization Committee originally planned to hold its first meeting in Bian on the 12th of this month. Due to my visit to the south, it must be postponed. Mr. Liu finally said that the Henan-Anhui border is very peaceful and the discipline of the garrison troops is also good. The truth about the assassination of Army Commander Liu Duoquan is still being investigated in detail. As for Yang Hucheng's postponement of his departure from Shaanxi, it is said that he is indeed ill and there are no other reasons. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Lawsuit against Liu Luyi at the Wuchang District Court (Continued) (Yesterday)

[Hankou] The evidence and applicable legal provisions in this case are explained separately below:

㊀ Regarding Liu Luyi's Part: According to the prosecutor, based on the evidence obtained during the investigation, if there is sufficient reason to believe that the defendant is suspected of committing a crime, a public prosecution should be initiated, as stipulated in Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. In this case, the "Plan for the Anti-Japanese Assassination Special Task Force of the Chinese Youth" drafted by Xu Qun was in Yang Xiaoming's handwriting, which was confirmed by Yang Qixin in court (see the investigation record of March 23). The twelve characters "Approve 2,000 yuan per month, to be remitted by Ru Yun" on the back of the plan were approved by Liu Luyi, which Liu Luyi also admitted on record. After the plan was approved, Yang Xiaoming, using anti-Japanese assassination as a cover, expanded the assassination organization and distributed his followers in Nanjing, Hankou, and other places to secretly carry out assassination work. For example, in May of last year, he had Xiao Zhun send a letter to Yang Qixin and Gong Bozhou, instructing them to go to Lushan to investigate the whereabouts of Chairman Jiang of the Provincial Government. In August, he summoned Yang Qixin and Gong Bozhou to Shanghai, where he personally gave them secret instructions, ordering Yang Qixin to be in charge of communications, to investigate the whereabouts of former Foreign Minister Zhang in Beijing, and to select a location for the assassination. He also gave Gong Bozhou 70 yuan in foreign currency, ordering him to buy a gun and go to Hankou for the assassination, and to go to Hankou in advance, using the alias Xu Chao, to oversee everything. On October 25 of the same year, at a pier at Jianghan Customs, he directed and supervised Cheng Suichao and Gong Bozhou on the spot, who shot and killed Chairman Yang. This was also confessed by accomplices Yang Qixin, Gong Bozhou, Cheng Xiechao, and Cao Bingrong. After thorough verification, Yang Xiaoming's steps for carrying out the assassination and his control over the party members in Beijing and Hubei were entirely consistent with the plan approved by Liu Luyi. It can be determined that Liu Luyi jointly incited Yang Xiaoming to organize an assassination team to commit murder. Although he argued that "he was elected as a standing committee member of the People's Movement Committee, and the approval of the plan was before the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi. At that time, he was under environmental pressure, and the approval was based on oral instructions, and he did not read the content of the plan at all. The expenses were not his responsibility, and he had already resigned from his position on the standing committee of the People's Movement Committee, and he was really unaware of this case," etc., but upon reviewing Yang Xiaoming's plan, it stated, "2. Regarding activity expenses, this refers to extraordinary times. 3. The reserve fund for extraordinary times is not included in the activity expenses and must be prepared in advance as travel expenses for escape when necessary," etc. The name of the organization also used the two characters "eliminate traitors," clearly revealing its purpose. Anyone could tell at a glance that it was an assassination organization. According to Liu Luyi's confession, this organization was one of the facility plans of the People's Movement Committee. Liu Luyi shared the responsibility for presiding over the committee's affairs, and he approved the funding for the special task force. How could he not have known the truth? Moreover, page 16 of Xiao Ruoxu's handwritten confession also contains records of Liu Luyi instigating murder. Xiao Ruoxu and Liu Luyi were under the same system and had a close relationship, so his words are credible. As for the accomplices Yang Qixin, Gong Bozhou, etc., although they pointed to others as the instigators in this case (see the successive confessions of Yang Qixin and Gong Bozhou), based on the aforementioned evidence, Liu Luyi must still bear the responsibility for joint incitement. Even if, as he claimed, the matter occurred before the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi and was forced by the environment, it cannot preclude the establishment of his criminal responsibility. His actions constitute the crimes of Article 28, Article 154, Paragraph 1, latter section, Article 29, Paragraphs 1 and 2, and Article 271, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Criminal Law, and he should be punished for the crime of joint incitement to commit intentional homicide, in accordance with Article 55 of the same law.

㊁ Regarding Cheng Xiechao's Part: The defendant Cheng Xiechao was caught red-handed by the police after committing the crime and has confessed to joining the assassination organization. He was directly commanded by Yang Xiaoming to hold a loaded handgun with Gong Bozhou at a pier in Hankou on October 25 of last year and jointly assassinate Chairman Yang. The facts of the crime are extremely clear. His actions constitute the crimes of Article 28, Article 271, Paragraph 1, and Article 154, Paragraph 1, first section of the Criminal Law. However, his crime of joint homicide is the result of participating in an assassination group and should be punished for the crime of joint intentional homicide, taking into account the relative severity of the statutory penalties for the two crimes in accordance with Article 55 of the same law (refer to Judgement No. 52 of 1931).

The parts concerning Gong Bozhou, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Yang Xiaoming, Xiao Zhun, Fan Jushu, Liang Jiubin, Li Qunjian, etc., are omitted.

In conclusion, except for Xiao Ru Yun, who is still at large and whose criminal facts are not yet clear and should be handled separately after he is apprehended, regarding the crimes of the aforementioned defendants, a public prosecution is jointly initiated in accordance with Article 230 and Article 243 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Addressed to the Criminal Division of this Court.

May 4, 26th year of the Republic of China, Chief Prosecutor Wang Lian of the Wuchang District Court, Seal. Zhu Chengzan, Prosecutor of the Hubei High Court, handling affairs at the Wuchang District Court. This document is certified to be identical to the original. Clerk Xing Weizu, May 4, 26th year of the Republic of China. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 6th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The British Attitude in the London Negotiations

— Star

In recent days, the focus of Far Eastern diplomacy has shifted to London. The negotiations between the British and Japanese representatives may be expanded into an international consultation due to the opportunity for key figures from various Far Eastern governments to gather in London for the British Emperor's coronation. Not only are the responsible leaders of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other self-governing dominions, which have the power to influence Britain's Far Eastern policy, currently in Britain, but the silent United States also has Davis, Roosevelt's most trusted "Ambassador to Europe," on the scene. The Far Eastern stalemate of the past six years may be an opportunity to break open. Although we cannot yet know whether the possibility of breaking this stalemate will be a blessing or a death knell for China.

China's position and Japan's hopes are relatively fixed and concrete. What we must pay attention to is the attitude of Britain, which is acting as a mediator. Before Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after the September 18th Incident, Britain's Far Eastern policy was to favor Japan. We can clearly see this in Stimson's recent book "The Crisis in the Far East." We can also say that Britain is not without blame for condoning Japan's destruction of Far Eastern collective security. However, Britain's condoning was limited. Japan's breach of faith and unreliability, however, knew no bounds. Since Japan recognized the puppet state, Britain's attitude has changed. Since Japan announced the oil monopoly of the puppet state and announced the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, Britain's attitude has changed again. From 1935 to the present, we cannot say that Britain favors Japan and suppresses China. The facts show that Britain's friendship with China is actively increasing.

In recent years, Britain's attitude can be said to be, first, to help China become self-reliant more quickly and ensure Far Eastern peace through technical, economic, and financial assistance. Second, it is to improve relations between Britain and the United States and make Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East more harmonious. Third, it is to promote a peaceful resolution of disputes between China and Japan and to maintain the situation in the Far East to some extent as it was after the Washington Conference before the September 18th Incident. Britain holds this attitude, undoubtedly for its own sake. Its interests in the Far East focus on economic and commercial matters, and stability and peace are its most urgent hopes. It has no intention of participating in the Far Eastern war, and even less does it want war between China and Japan. As long as its economic interests in China and South China are maintained, it is very willing to persuade China to make concessions and recognize the current situation. Its assistance to China, cooperation with the United States, and expansion of armaments are merely means of advising Japan to know when to stop. We are not saying that Britain's means are insincere. However, we cannot mistake the actions of Britain in the Far East in recent years as seeking a way out for China.

Therefore, in the London negotiations conducted under this motive and attitude, we cannot but guard against Britain neglecting the interests of the Chinese nation for the sake of greed and convenience. Of course, Britain will not openly advise us to recognize the puppet state of Manchuria. However, we also do not agree to Britain recognizing Japan's special economic and military strategies in North China. Because this is contrary to the principles of territorial integrity, sovereign independence, and the open door policy. Of course, Japan may be willing to take care of Britain's existing interests in China and not infringe upon them, and will temporarily stop the process of wantonly invading Chinese territory. However, we cannot endure the past losses, present shame, and future crises for the sake of Britain's security. We cannot give up the hope of national revival and sever our future life for the sake of momentary peace.

Not only do we not want war in the Far East, but we also hope that the Far Eastern stalemate can be resolved peacefully. We welcome Japan to participate in the international collective security system again. Economically, we can welcome Japan's sincere cooperation. However, we must adhere to the basic principle that the sovereignty of the Republic of China must not be lost in the slightest, and the territory of the Chinese nation cannot be abandoned by an inch. If Britain understands that Far Eastern peace must be based on justice, equality, and mutual assistance, then it must not be fooled by the Japanese for the sake of its own interests and current convenience, lose China's friendship, and increase the resentment and frustration of various self-governing dominions and countries around the world.

### Hindenburg Airship Explosion in Germany

Flames Rose, Instantly Burning the Airship to a Shell; 34 People Died, and the Captain Was Seriously Injured

⊙ Lakehurst, New Jersey, USA. The German airship "Hindenburg," which travels over the Atlantic Ocean, suddenly exploded en route today and immediately caught fire. Of the 100 passengers, 50 have died. Initially, it was thought that all 100 passengers had perished. However, according to a report from the U.S. Naval Air Station tonight, 50 of them survived. This was the "Hindenburg" airship's first transatlantic flight of the season from Germany. It was scheduled to arrive at its destination here at 6 p.m. tonight. Unexpectedly, when flying near New York, it encountered a thunderstorm and detoured over the area of Manasquan. As it approached the mooring mast in Lakehurst, a deafening boom was heard. In an instant, the entire airship was engulfed in flames. By 7:35 p.m., the airship's framework had fallen to the ground, with its massive beams partially exposed.

According to a senior naval officer who spoke to an Associated Press reporter, the fire was likely caused by a "hydrogen explosion." Several surviving passengers are being treated at the naval hospital. A passenger from Chicago, Mr. Rawling, stated that he was among the first to jump out when the airship crashed. At the time of the fire, the airship was about 300 feet above the ground. The explosion lit up the entire scene, indicating its intensity. Around 8 p.m., the lower part of the airship was still shrouded in thick smoke, while the upper part of the framework was twisted like a fiery mountain. Hundreds of spectators who had come to welcome the airship were present. The sudden eruption of this tragedy left them in a state of shock and screaming indescribably. The exact number of casualties was difficult to ascertain at the time of transmission. However, it was reported that in addition to the crew and passengers, ground staff at the airfield were also caught off guard and perished. The captain was Mr. Pruss, and the former captain, Mr. Lehmann, was also on board as an observer. It is reported that they both survived, but were severely burned. In addition, the airship was carrying 340 pounds of cargo, 240 pounds of mail, and one ton of luggage. (6th National Telegram)

⊙ Lakehurst. As of 9 a.m. this morning, of the 100 passengers and crew members on the "Hindenburg," 24 passengers and 42 crew members survived. The remaining 15 passengers and 19 crew members are either dead or missing. An American citizen who was observing the airship's mooring was also tragically killed. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas Dispatch)

### Details of the Accident

Disaster from the Sky, a Tragic Scene

⊙ Lakehurst. The "Hindenburg" airship departed Frankfurt at 8:15 p.m. on Monday evening and arrived here at 6:20 p.m. this evening. As it was mooring, it was struck by this strange disaster. The number of casualties has not yet been confirmed. A representative of the Zeppelin Company announced that 20 passengers and 44 crew members survived, bringing the death toll to 35, including 19 passengers and 16 crew members. However, the U.S. Navy Department learned that at least 48 people had died. It is reported that Captain Pruss, the airship's commander, was among those rescued. When flames suddenly erupted from the rear of the airship, the bow immediately tilted sharply downwards. Within minutes, the entire airship was destroyed on the ground, unrecognizable. Friends and relatives who were waiting at the field to welcome the airship were shocked and distraught to witness it reduced to ashes in an instant, and many were weeping. Army rescue vehicles raced to the scene with sirens wailing. The scene was truly harrowing and dizzying. The airship was originally scheduled to arrive at 6 a.m. yesterday, but was delayed by twelve hours due to headwinds encountered in the skies over Newfoundland. After arriving here, it still circled in the sky for about an hour, waiting for clear weather for a safe mooring. When the flames erupted, police immediately broadcast a radio message urging all city ambulances and firefighters to rush to the scene for rescue. After arriving in the U.S., the airship was scheduled to take the last batch of American passengers to Europe to attend the coronation of the British King. Its flight to the U.S. next week had been postponed by two days to carry films of the coronation ceremony in London to the U.S. According to eyewitnesses, the airship was flying only a few hundred feet above the sea, and passengers were reaching out of the windows, waving and smiling downwards. Suddenly, a loud boom was heard, like the explosion of a bomb, and instantly red and black smoke rose straight into the sky. In an instant, the airship crashed to the ground. Among the passengers, Colonel Maurice, former U.S. Minister to Sweden, is unaccounted for. Among the survivors is Mr. Rawling of Chicago, who jumped out of a window. After the airship crashed, flames shot out in all directions, making it impossible to approach. Rescue work could only begin after a long time. The area was cordoned off with ropes, and even ambulances could not pass through. Newspaper reporters were turned away. Captain Lehmann of Germany, who was on board as an advisor, was reportedly severely burned and has been taken to the hospital. He was in the control room when the disaster struck and managed to escape by jumping out of there. According to a photographer who witnessed the entire disaster, he saw the ship engulfed in flames, and in less than a second, this magnificent airship was reduced to a shell, with all its decorations gone. He saw a person being supported by two people, completely naked. A ground worker stated that he and his colleagues immediately ran to avoid being hit by burning debris. They found three bodies at the rear of the ship, their faces charred beyond recognition, and one was still barely alive. After the airship crashed, there were still occasional small explosions, and the cries for help from inside the ship could be heard clearly. Senator Copeland of the U.S. Senate Committee on Aviation Safety (Democrat from New York) stated that he intends to send personnel to immediately investigate the cause of the airship's accident. (Central News Agency, 6th Reuters Dispatch)

⊙ Lakehurst. New York Mayor LaGuardia has arrived here to oversee rescue efforts. The cause of the accident is being investigated by the federal government. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas Dispatch)

### Cause of the Explosion

Likely Due to Not Using Helium; German Side Suspects Sabotage

[Washington] After the "Hindenburg" explosion, Count Zeppelin, the nephew of Count Zeppelin, the inventor of the Zeppelin airship, currently in Chicago, stated that the highly flammable oxygen balloons were located in the middle of the airship, while the explosion occurred at the rear of the airship, where there was no flammable material. The cause of the accident is inexplicable and may be due to sabotage. However, this is only a preliminary impression and should not be taken as definitive. Semi-official sources in the United States say that the cause of the "Hindenburg" accident was the use of hydrogen instead of helium. Last year when the ship made it's first flight across the Atlantic in May, the former captain, Dr. Eckener, advocated the purchase of helium to avoid danger (hydrogen is flammable, while helium is not). At that time, the United States intended to provide a full supply, but the deal fell through because the German government prohibited the export of cash and was unable to pay the price. The only natural helium production sites in the world are the United States and Canada. Although there are factories in other places that extract helium, the cost is very high, which is why the "Hindenburg" used hydrogen. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas Dispatch)

[Berlin] Dr. Eckener, a famous Zeppelin airship pilot, exclaimed in horror upon hearing the news of the "Hindenburg" burning: "Tragic, tragic!" Dr. Eckener told a Reuters reporter that he had repeatedly advocated the use of helium instead of hydrogen in airships, and that this tragedy further proves the necessity of this measure. The only problem is that Germany does not have the raw materials to produce helium. The airship's misfortune is very likely due to sabotage. He had repeatedly received anonymous threatening letters warning him not to allow the "Hindenburg" to land at Lakehurst. The airship was equipped with the latest fire prevention equipment and would never explode due to electric shock. He was shocked and saddened by the news. (Central News Agency, 7th Reuters Dispatch)

⊙ Lakehurst. The cause of the "Hindenburg" fire has not yet been determined this morning. The general opinion is that sparks from the engine ignited leaking gas, as sparks were seen near the "tail fin" before the ship exploded. According to Mr. Wilson, director of aviation affairs for New Jersey, there was a hydrogen explosion in the second compartment at the rear of the ship, which is very strange. (Central News Agency, 7th Reuters Dispatch)

### Hindenburg's Structure and Contents

Impeccable Safety Equipment; This is the Seventh Disaster to Befall an Airship

⊙ Lakehurst. The British airship R-101 crashed near Beauvais, France, killing 48 people. In light of this, German authorities paid special attention to the design of the "Hindenburg" to avoid repeating the R-101's tragedy. The ship was made of lightweight metal and contained no wood. The ship's hull was that of the R-101, which the German government purchased from Britain after the R-101's accident and used to build the "Hindenburg." After its completion, the "Hindenburg" made its first transatlantic flight in 1936, carrying 51 passengers, including 10 women, and 56 crew members, to Lakehurst on May 9th. Since then, it has flown regularly between the U.S. and Germany, with the aim of testing whether scheduled transatlantic airship service could be realized. The U.S. Navy Department granted special permission to use the mooring mast at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. It was moored to this mast each time it arrived there. Its base was in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, near Berlin, Germany. The walls were made entirely of balloon material, with modern decorations. The armchairs in the public room were light and comfortable. Every cabin had a shower and washbasin. The interior of the ship was magnificent, painted silver. A Reuters reporter once said that ascending the glittering metal ladder and entering the interior of the ship was like entering a world of the future. A special room made of non-flammable materials was set up for passengers to smoke. The "Hindenburg" was the first Zeppelin airship to allow smoking. Passengers entering and leaving the room had to have the lock opened by a special officer, and they were not allowed to leave unless they discarded their cigarettes in a water-filled ashtray. The safety equipment was impeccable. Telephones were available throughout the ship. However, the line from the control room to the vicinity of the coal equipment was replaced with a speaking tube to prevent electric shock. The ship had four 1,000-horsepower engines. Only two engines were needed during flight, so even if two were damaged, the remaining two could meet the needs. In 1900, the first Zeppelin airship could only fly eight miles per hour, while the "Hindenburg" had a speed of 85 miles per hour, so it could fly from Europe to the United States in 60 hours. On the return trip, it would only take about 40 hours with a tailwind. The ship had two decks and weighed 100 tons empty and 200 tons with passengers.

Since the European War, this is the seventh disaster to befall a German Zeppelin airship. The order and number of casualties are as follows:

1919, U.S. "C-8," 75 deaths. 1921, British "R-38," 43 deaths. 1922, U.S. "Roma," 34 deaths. 1923, French "Dixmude," 54 deaths. 1930, British "R-101," 48 deaths. 1933, U.S. "Akron," 74 deaths. (Central News Agency, 7th Reuters Dispatch)

### Egypt's Abolition of Capitulation Agreement to Be Signed Today

Transition Period Set at Twelve Years; Political Freedom Enters a New Path

⊙ Montreux. The text of the agreement to abolish Egyptian consular jurisdiction has been accepted by the conference today and will be signed on the morning of the 8th. The Mixed Courts will continue to exist, but they will be deprived of the legislative power they previously enjoyed. The transition period is set at twelve years. During this period, Egypt is not allowed to discriminate against the nationals of the contracting countries. The judicial powers that originally belonged to the consular courts will be transferred to the Mixed Courts. However, the power to review the implementation of Egyptian laws and regulations will be cancelled. In addition, according to this new agreement, no contracting country can protect Egyptian citizens. Most other issues, such as the legal status of foreign educational institutions and public utilities, are clearly resolved in the conference declaration. (6th National Coastal Telegram)

⊙ Montreux. The General Committee of the International Conference on the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction in Egypt has passed the final draft documents on this issue this afternoon and submitted them to the plenary session for approval. The conference, which has worked hard for more than twenty days, has now concluded and has decided to sign the international convention on the abolition of consular jurisdiction on the morning of the 8th of this month. The most important point passed at today's meeting was the definition of "foreigners." In the future, all people who belong to the nationality of the signatory countries will be "foreigners," as will the people of other countries specified by the Egyptian government in future orders. As for the people of the Syrian and Lebanese Republics (both territories mandated to France by the League of Nations) and Palestine (territory mandated to Britain by the League of Nations), they are under the jurisdiction of Egyptian local law, and Egyptian citizens are not allowed to receive protection from any foreign country. Mr. Tedesan, the chief French representative and aide to the State Council, made a statement to the newspapers expressing his pleasure with the results of the conference, saying, "In the future, the relationship between Egypt and other countries will be based on political liberalism and enter a new path."

### Japanese Minseitō Party Demands That the Hayashi Cabinet Not Cling to Power

The Party's New Legislators Held a General Meeting Yesterday; President Machida Gave a Strong Speech

[Tokyo] The Minseitō Party held a general meeting of new legislators this morning. Under the banner of "Overthrowing the Hayashi Cabinet," all 179 new Diet members attended. First, Secretary-General Nagai and Yukio Sakurauchi gave inspiring speeches, demanding that the Hayashi Cabinet resign and restore constitutional government. After the speeches, a reshuffle of party officials was held. On the nomination of President Machida, the party's Director-General and others were determined. Finally, President Machida took the stage amid applause from party members and delivered a speech. The atmosphere of overthrowing the Hayashi Cabinet was very high. The main points of President Machida's speech are as follows: "Our party, based on the will of the entire nation, demands the resignation of the current cabinet. If the government continues to ignore today's public opinion and faces the special session of the Diet with a narrow-minded bureaucratic ideology of self-righteousness and continues to hold power, then we will resolutely impeach it at the beginning of the Diet session. Prime Minister Hayashi should not be biased by personal feelings based on the so-called principle of selfless service to the public. For the sake of the country's major plan, he should reflect on himself. Judging from this election, the nation's rejection of dictatorial and self-righteous politics and its desire for a clear and impartial public opinion-based government are extremely evident. Therefore, for the sake of upholding constitutional government, the urgent task now is to organize a powerful national unity cabinet based on justice and the general will of the nation to reform the administration and promote the expansion of national fortune. With this spirit, thinking for the country, I sincerely hope to express a fresh experience in state affairs with the cooperation of the entire nation in order to overcome the difficulties of the times. However, in order to achieve this goal, our party must have the determination to sacrifice itself for the country and move forward bravely." (7th Allied Dispatch)

### Italian and German Cooperation Policy

Aim to Restore the Balance of Power in Europe; German Foreign Minister Gives a Speech

[Rome] Before returning home yesterday from here, German Foreign Minister Neurath made a speech to the "Italian Daily" newspaper, stating, "The attitude adopted by Germany and Italy in the Spanish Civil War is aimed only at preserving European culture and allowing the Spanish people to decide their own fate." He also said that the cooperation policy between Germany and Italy does not exclude other countries from participating. On the contrary, its purpose is to restore the balance of power in Europe in a peaceful manner, without any selfish intentions. However, peaceful evolution must also take into account the interests of the various European nations, which are vital to their survival. Regarding the future European convention, he said that once the Belgian issue is resolved, the inherent interests of the other countries concerned should be drafted into a plan and taken into account. Diplomatic circles here have commented on Neurath's speech, believing that Germany and Italy advocate a referendum by the Spanish people to end the Spanish Civil War and oppose mediation by other countries. In addition, Japanese Ambassador to Italy Sugimura was also at the station to see Neurath off when he left for home yesterday. This matter has also attracted the attention of diplomatic circles, who said that Neurath's visit to Italy also discussed the mutual relations between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The official communiqué issued after the German and Italian talks stated that "the two countries are willing to engage in international cooperation." This cooperation not only applies to some countries in Europe, but also includes countries in the East and West, including the Soviet Union. Since the Italian newspaper has recently stopped mentioning its opposition to communism and diplomatic circles have the above opinions, this is worth noting.

### Situation in Barcelona Not Stable

Disturbances Flare Up in the Suburbs; Authorities Able to Control

⊙ Perpignan. It is heard that disturbances broke out again in the city of Barcelona today. Telephone traffic between the city and the rest of the Catalan Autonomous Region, which was restored yesterday, was blocked again this morning. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas Dispatch)

The bloody riots currently occurring are limited to the city of Barcelona and parts of the suburbs, while the rest of the region is completely calm. The situation of the government army on the Aragon front has not been weakened as a result. On the contrary, the front line positions have been improved. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas Dispatch)

### Avert Coal Mine Strike in Britain

Mediation Efforts of the Minister of Mines

[London] The national coal mine strike has been averted. Captain Crookshank, the Minister of Mines, met with the executive committee of the Miners' Federation last night for six hours. The authorities then announced that if the Minister of Mines intends to convene a meeting of the three parties concerned, the executive department is prepared to suspend the delivery of miners' notices for two weeks from May 8. The Minister of Mines has invited both labor and management to participate in the meeting and is scheduled to continue discussing the matter with the executive committee of the Miners' Federation tomorrow. The hope of resolving the dispute between the two parties is now more prominent. However, whether the two parties can reach a truce depends on whether the coal mine owners of Nottinghamshire and the Industrial Federation there will accept the Minister of Mines' request. The executive committee told the Minister of Mines that they made the decision to call a truce because the Prime Minister made a sincere appeal in the House of Commons and did not want to disappoint his sincerity.

### The Mongol Puppet Army Begins Advancing Westward

The Scourge of War Has Not Yet Reached the Point of Eruption, Yet a Certain Party is Employing Wang Ying and Others to Recruit Bandits

Zhangbei Correspondence: The puppet troops of Chahar Province, after a long period of reorganization and training, are now proclaiming a westward advance, breaking the atmosphere of past silence. It is rumored that the puppet troops' actions are becoming increasingly tense, which is related to the visit of Ueda, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, to Chengde and his inspection of Huade. However, the outbreak of war will definitely not start abruptly because of this. The reasons are roughly as follows: ① According to recent facts, De Wang and Li Shouxin have clearly gone their separate ways, and the strength of the puppet army is not as strong as it used to be. It is virtually impossible to launch a sudden westward invasion. ② The puppet army’s strength is less than before, and Bailingmiao, the political and military center outside the pass, has also been lost. Without a stronger force than before, it is difficult to expect progress. According to the policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" by a certain party, before the regular troops of a certain party enter northern Chahar and the strength of the puppet army itself is expanded, the scourge of war cannot erupt immediately. ③ In the past three or four days, a certain party has transported a large number of aircraft bombs and gun bullets from Zhangbei to the interior, about 50 cars. If there is a determination to fight, these killing weapons should not be allowed to leave the army. As for the southwest movement of the Mongol puppet army, its purpose is actually to increase defense, fearing that it will repeat the past failure of being attacked in Nanhaoqian and Honggeertu before the offensive. The team that is now moving was already stationed in Chongli County, the 17th Regiment of the puppet Sixth Division's Baoan Pu Department, and arrived in Zhangbei on the third of this month. The puppet Eighth Division's Bao Yueqing Department, stationed in the Duolun Guyuan area, is preparing to move west. As for other troops, they are all in their original defenses. The puppet Rehe army and the regular troops of a certain party have not yet entered Chahar. The reason for the tense atmosphere is actually to imitate the preemptive strike of our national army, so they claim to advance westward every day, but in reality, they are still lax. Considering that the puppet army in northern Chahar has such a situation, it is equivalent to creating an opportunity for the already-disgraced traitors Wang Ying, Zhang Wanqing, and Lei Zhongtian to be reused. According to sources in related parties, a certain party has provided a large amount of money (reportedly 350,000 yuan) to Wang, Zhang, and Lei to recruit bandits and expand their strength. Wang and others have obtained this original source of activity and are proceeding separately. Now they have completed the incorporation of bandits in the mountains of Fengning in Rehe, and Li Desheng's unit, which had mutinied from Hu Binshan's brigade, has also been fully incorporated, totaling nearly 3,000 people, all scattered near the Great Wall. Wang and others are planning to have these bandit troops led by Lei Zhongtian and Zhang Wanqing, enter northern Chahar Guyuan from Gubeikou via Rehe Fengning one after another, waiting for dispatch (3rd).

### Baoding Repeatedly Detects Drug Trafficking Cases Under a Certain Party's Policy of Poisoning

Even the drug-dealing Korean Kim Hee-soon and others are escorted to the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin to await their disposal.

Baoding Correspondence: The Hebei Provincial Government has been extremely serious in cracking down on highly addictive drugs in recent years. Last year, it issued a notice to the county governments and administrative commissioners of various districts, ordering them to eradicate the atmosphere of drugs in their jurisdictions within a limited time, and granting the county magistrates and commissioners the power to immediately execute drug dealers and repeat offenders on the spot. Therefore, five to six hundred drug dealers were executed by firing squad in various counties last year. After this strict prohibition, drug offenders in the province have gradually disappeared, and the important task of drug prohibition has gradually been completed. However, in recent months, a large number of drug trafficking cases have suddenly been uncovered in various parts of the province, which has aroused the attention of the provincial authorities. Moreover, most of the drug traffickers are Korean vagrants, which proves that this is a planned policy of poisoning by a certain party. Because highly addictive drugs are all manufactured by a certain party, and in recent years, our authorities have strictly cracked down on them, Chinese people are afraid of the law and dare not engage in transportation and sale anymore. Those who use drugs also mostly quit on their own, or are detained by officials and given abstinence, so that they cannot smoothly sell a large number of drugs they manufacture. This not only makes it difficult to achieve their profit-making goal but also prevents their conspiracy of poisoning from being realized. However, in recent years, there are numerous drug-manufacturing places in special areas such as eastern Hebei, with huge production volumes. In order to develop their business and continue to implement their policy of poisoning, they send a large number of Korean vagrants, euphemistically called merchants of a certain country, to travel to various places, but in reality, they secretly carry large amounts of drugs and sell them secretly. Recently, the Baoding Railway Station has uncovered drug trafficking incidents every day within ten days, and most of the large-scale traffickers are Koreans. According to their confessions, the Chinese offenders are all bought by a certain party or are envoys left behind by a certain party. As for the arrested Koreans, they were identified as Kim Hee-soon, 28 years old, Kim Hak-sung, 38 years old, Lee Sung-taek, 24 years old, Zhang Gengxing, female, 41 years old, and Zhu Yingchun, 35 years old. In addition to confiscating a total of 36 catties and 7 taels of heroin they were carrying and destroying it by burning, all the offenders were escorted to the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin to be dealt with as they saw fit. As for all the Chinese drug traffickers, including Zhang Xiaofeng, Li Qichang, Song Eryin, Lü Deming, and Ruan Junxian, who were carrying more than 25 catties of heroin, they were all sent to the Baoding Military Police and Gendarmerie Inspection Office for interrogation, and then handed over to the Security Headquarters for severe punishment in accordance with the regulations on punishing drug offenders, as a warning.

### Liu Shangqing and Others Go to Anhui to Take Office

The Remaining Bandits in Anhui Province Have Been Eliminated One After Another; Preparation of the National Rice Sales Inspection Group

Wuhu Correspondence: The newly appointed Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, Liu Shangqing, took a steamer from Nanjing to Anqing on the 5th to assume his duties first. Accompanying him were the newly appointed Director of Civil Affairs Wei Jian, Secretary-General Jin Yufu, and members of the Provincial Committee Shao Hua and Chen Yeqing. The former member of the Provincial Committee and Director of Civil Affairs, Ma Lingfu, had to go to Nanjing to take up the new position of Councilor of the Executive Yuan and needed to discuss the handover with Mr. Liu, so he specially accompanied the former member of the Provincial Committee and Director of Construction Liu Yiyan, Director of Finance Yang Mianzhong, and others to Wuhu to welcome him in advance. When Mr. Liu and others arrived at the port, Mao Longzhang, the Administrative Commissioner of the Ninth District of Xuancheng, Gao Wenbo, the Administrative Commissioner of the Second District of Wuhu, as well as the heads of various agencies, representatives from industry and commerce, and the principals of various middle schools, all boarded the ship to welcome them. Mr. Liu's actions, words, and demeanor were extremely lively and sharp. In addition to thanking those who welcomed him, he inquired in detail about the security of the province and the customs of the people. Later, he invited reporters for a discussion, expressing that his political philosophy has always been that doing more is better than saying more. However, the failure to quell the banditry is enough to affect the promotion of all undertakings. Therefore, he will make special efforts to eliminate the remaining bandits. Also, Anhui Province produces the best rice in the country. He will also actively coordinate and adjust the improvement of planting and the promotion to the outside world. Soon, Mr. Liu and others had already taken the original steamer to the province.

The banditry and the production and sales of rice in Anhui Province have recently been the subject of great concern by various people. The latest situation is as follows: ① Banditry: The remaining bandits in the border areas of southern Anhui have gradually been eliminated. There are no traces of bandits in the areas of Lihuang and Huoshan in western Anhui. However, there are still scattered bandits harassing the neighboring territory of Hubei. The garrison's defenses have not been relaxed at all. At present, there are a total of twelve regiments of the provincial security team. In addition to one regiment stationed in each of the ten supervisory districts, commanded and dispatched by the district security commander, the remaining two regiments are directly under the Security Department and are currently stationed on the borders of Anhui and Zhejiang and Anhui and Jiangxi. Moreover, in recent years, all units have not distinguished between regions in suppressing bandits. Therefore, the scattered and small number of remaining bandits in Anhui are not enough to cause concern. However, the people in southern Anhui are accustomed to being weak and have no self-defense capabilities. In order to achieve long-term peace and stability, there is only a way to strictly organize Baojia to increase the people's self-defense capabilities, so that banditry will naturally be completely eliminated. Also, the north-south tea market in Anhui is now being properly maintained by the security teams in various districts, and troops are being dispatched to assist in the defense. Tea farmers and tea merchants can safely pick, manufacture, and transport and sell their product. ② Rice: In order to seek the interests of both rice production and sales, Anhui merchants, with the consent of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, organized a National Rice Sales Inspection Group. Yesterday, representatives from various parties gathered in Anqing to discuss and decide on the following points: ① Purpose: The purpose of the National Rice Inspection Group is to seek the improvement of the following items: (A) How to improve the quality of rice in the central China provinces; (B) How to seek the stability of rice prices, so that producers in central China will not be harmed by cheap grain, and consumers in southern China will not be harmed by expensive rice; (C) How to rationalize the market organization, reduce the cost of rice sales, make rice transportation smooth, and connect the feelings of the people in central and southern China to eliminate the separation between production and sales. ② Organization: The group is named the National Rice Sales Inspection Group. In addition to being organized by representatives from the business community of related provinces and cities, experts are also hired to assist and guide. ③ Preparation: The business community in Wuhu and selected personnel are responsible for the preparation. Their responsibilities are: (A) Summon representatives; (B) Formulate an inspection schedule; (C) Formulate the inspection location and liaise in advance; (D) Budget for travel expenses; (E) Allocate work; (F) Collect all relevant materials. It is also heard that the Shanghai business community believes that this inspection group is of great importance to the national food and economic economy, and has also telegraphed to participate.

### Severe Drought in Guangxi Province Has Resulted in Famine

People are Starving Along the Roads in the Counties of Zuoyoujiang; All Sectors in Nanning Initiate Emergency Relief Efforts

Wuzhou Correspondence: After the floods in the counties of Youjiang, Qianjiang, and Guode in Guangxi Province last year, there has been a severe drought again this spring, and no grain has been harvested. In the townships of Shengpo and Tiannan in Zhenjie County, Youjiang, more than 30 children have starved to death, and people are starving along the roads. Those who are struggling to survive are eating tree bark. As for the Lianchuan township in Qianjiang County, the hungry people are all eating wild mugwort, wild water chestnuts, and yams to satisfy their hunger. Many daughters cannot afford to raise them, and dozens of girls have been sold in recent days. Twenty-seven households in Xiwu Village have been displaced. Local rice sells for two cents per catty. The Guangxi Provincial Government has recently allocated 20,000 catties of warehouse grain for emergency relief, but this is a drop in the bucket, and the hungry people are still crying for food. All sectors in Nanning have launched emergency relief efforts, organizing donation teams to solicit donations from the charity sector. Civil servants in Yongshi all donate one day's salary, and each entertainment venue will collect a disaster relief donation for one month. The Red Cross Society in the city has allocated several thousand yuan to buy rice and distribute it for relief. At the same time, the Famine Relief Committee organized by all sectors telegraphed the whole country, appealing for relief. The original telegram stated, "Last year, between the summer and autumn, the rivers in our province rose sharply, and the low-lying rice paddies were all lost to the east. From last winter to this spring, we have suffered another drought, and the production of both primary and secondary crops has been reduced, resulting in a shortage of food and a famine. The disaster situation in the lower reaches of the Zuoyoujiang is particularly severe. According to reports from Guode, Zhenjie, Wancheng, Longshan, Xianjiang, and Xiangdu counties, people have no rice to cook, and the heads and roots of ferns have been dug up and eaten. Those who starve to death are all over the mountains and valleys. We beg you to have great compassion and quickly allocate huge sums of money to the association so that we can distribute relief. The disaster victims will be very fortunate," etc. Recently, according to a telegram from the Hebei Provincial Government, Feng Zhi'an, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, allocated 2,000 yuan to be remitted to Guangxi by the bank and asked the provincial government to transfer it to the disaster relief association of all sectors for proper distribution of relief (May 1st).

### Songjiang

Farmers Growing Opium Poppies Arrested

Wang Jizhou, a police officer at the Punan Town Police Substation in the county, passed by the first Bao area of Panhu Township at about 4 pm on the 5th and saw more than 30 opium poppies planted on the edge of a field belonging to a farmer, Ji Shengyun. As they were about to bloom, Officer Wang immediately pulled up the flowers and took Ji Shengyun and Cao Wenjie, the head of the area, to the station. After a preliminary interrogation by Inspector Yang, both denied any intention. Inspector Yang, according to the confession, believed that the case was related to opium policy and transferred it to the county bureau for referral to the District Headquarters for interrogation on the 7th.

### Changshu

Ferries Established Across the Yangtze River

Previously, gentlemen and merchants from Nantong County, in order to connect transportation across the Yangtze River, planned to establish a ferry between the Langshan Port in the county and the Fukou Port in this town to connect with the highway to facilitate transportation. However, it was found that the beach at Fukou Port was very far away, making it inconvenient to build a wharf, so it did not materialize. Now, the Nantong District Inspectorate Commissioner believes that the intersection of the north and south sides of the Yangtze River must be connected, so he again proposed a plan to open a ferry and submit it to the province for approval. After receiving the report, the Jiangsu Construction Department specially telegraphed Ling Zhibin, the head of the Construction Section of this county, to Jiangsu Province to inquire about ① the current situation of Fukou Port, ② the distance from the center of the river to the water depth and the nature of the beach near the port, ③ the water level at high tide and low tide, ④ whether it is convenient for a ferry accommodating 100 people to enter and exit, and ⑤ whether the crossing time of two hours can be reached, etc. Mr. Ling has already gone to Jiangsu Province on the 7th.

When Hu and others were sent to the department for interrogation, it was learned that after the district chief Ke interrogated the case, he confessed the name of the instigator, who was hiding in a certain place in Shanghai. He immediately sent someone to Shanghai to arrest him, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Yesterday, more than 300 loads of scrap metal were found on the wasteland opposite Hu Fengren's residence outside Panmen. More than 1,000 loads have been found so far.

The headquarters then entrusted the local courts to summon the silver industry to inquire about the fact that the amount of money raised to entrust Gu to forward to Yin Zaigui's Dahuawan Evening News share fund was 38,000 yuan, and the numbers were all correct. A letter was replied to the department, thus proving that Gu had little to do with the Yin case. He was released on the afternoon of the 6th and regained his freedom. Gu will return to Hedi in a few days.

### Leftovers from the Yunnan Journey (9)

— 桮棬 (A Pen Name, Untranslated)

The Eighteenth Day (April 12th): Chongan Telephone: The water has receded four feet. All the cars crossed the crossing one after another, and all arrived at eleven o'clock, leaving only the second car in Shibing. Those who stayed in Chongan last night, although they had luggage, had no supplies and were starving. Some bought miscellaneous grains and coarse cakes to fill their stomachs. Those who arrived in Lushan had to live in straw seedlings and some were crying from the cold. Since the departure of our group, this is the first day to suffer a little hardship. Also, mountain rocks collapsed four or five li from here, and the highway collapsed. Hundreds of workers have been sent to rush repairs day and night. Therefore, today we have no choice but to change the scheduled date exceptionally and add a stay in Lushan. However, the local supply is only prepared for one night. Even if today is just coarse dishes and light meals, it is enough to burden the local area. The population of Lushan is 47,000 in the entire county, 70% of whom are Miao people. The Miao women who came out to greet us were mostly dressed in court costumes, with silver crowns or silver crowns (the silver crowns cost 30 taels of silver and 10 yuan for manual labor). Their faces were mostly powdered, and they all had the qualifications for healthy beauty. There are seven types of Miao: Green Miao, Xijia, 𤠇jia, Dongjia, Muqia, Shuijia, Black Miao.

"Green Miao" are mostly rich and decorate luxuriously. Some wear silver helmets all over their bodies, and some wear six or seven necklaces weighing twenty or thirty catties. The daughter of the security team leader, Mr. Yang, and others belong to this group. "Xijia" has different decorations, wearing embroidered aprons and headbands with printed patterns. "𤠇jia" wear small red caps. It is said that those who have not given birth to children wear red caps, and they will not wear them after giving birth. This time, because the inspection group passed through, each tribe specially dressed up. The songs and dances were all petty bourgeois. The rest of the ordinary Miao people only wear high buns or headbands and sky-blue dresses. When we left Zhenyuan, Regiment Commander Chu gave 450 yuan to the Miao people as a tea and snack allowance to promote the central government's virtues. In Lushan, he gave 2 yuan to each Miao person who participated in the dance. Yang Xiuzhi, a Miao girl from "Crab Town," graduated from elementary school, has outstanding talent and appearance, has kind eyes and words. Members of the group competed to take photos with her, and some visited her residence. Mr. He Sui gave a watch to Yang, and Mr. Shang Qixu talked with Yang quite speculatively. Mr. Wei Tingsheng and Mr. Xu Shiyong visited Yang together. When the young and handsome Mr. Xu saw Yang, he said to her aunt, "Please introduce this young official to me for advice." It shows the naivete and loveliness of the Miao people. Thus, "Since the dancers were seen in Lushan, everyone said Yang Xiuzhi."

There is a Christian church near the Crab Town of Lushan, and many Miao people are Christians. American missionaries compiled a small booklet of Miao words in English transliteration. Miao people have no writing, but they have language, and each language system is different. Even if some of the language is compiled, it cannot be popularized. Along the way, there are churches in every county, which shows that the cultural invasion of Europeans and Americans has penetrated the lower levels of the Miao people.

There are only four elementary schools in Lushan County. A bag of flour costs 10 yuan, a load of rice costs 20 yuan, and a box of matches costs 20 copper coins, which is caused by inconvenient transportation.

In the afternoon, some people went to the "Dafeng Cave," which is ten miles away, for sightseeing. There are two caves, the south cave is about two li deep, and the north cave has a lot of water and cannot be entered deeply. The temple is built on the edge of the county cliff, similar to the "Yongling Mountain" opposite San Sui Island. The temple looks similar. The cave is dark. Bring a flashlight inside to prove that it is a sedimentary rock, which has been peeled off and emptied over time. The content is quite similar to the "Shuiyue Cave" in Hangzhou, and there is also a right breast-shaped suspension on the cave wall, which is much smaller than that of Yixing and Shan Juan Gengsang.

The Nineteenth Day (April 23rd): Rain. Depart from Lushan, pass the Wuliqiao Bridge, there is a hill, which is too steep to climb, and the ground is slippery. The car went backwards. Everyone got out of the car, pulled the axle with an iron cable, and dozens of people pulled it up. After another 30 kilometers, we reached Quanma Changping, where we saw mules and horses "carrying 1,500 loads, divided into four teams, with several motorcycle cards guiding the way. These native goods came from Yunnan. Each load was packed in two boxes, each weighing more than 1,000 taels. Counting 1,500 loads, the number is astonishing. There are teams patrolling along the way, and several motorcycle cards follow. It can be seen that the protection of the frontier "native" is thorough. The area belongs to Pingyue County. After another 40 kilometers, we arrived at Guiding County. Mr. Zhang Zhihan, the Director of Education, came to Guiding to welcome us and had lunch at the elementary school. There are Jiangxi Guild Hall and Minyue Guild Hall in Guiding, which shows the sales of porcelain and seafood in Guizhou in those years. After another 30 kilometers, we reached Longli County. After Longli, we entered the highest mountain range, "Guanyin Mountain." The barometer showed 1,360 meters. The car passed through the clouds and through the road. After another 30 kilometers, Director Xue Yue, Chairman Han Deqin, Army Commander Yang Sen, and Civil Affairs Director Cao Jingyuan of Guiyang all came out of the city to welcome us ten miles away. People from all walks of life and the army welcomed us for three kilometers. Everyone got out of the car and walked into the city across the Nanming River Bridge.

The Twentieth Day (April 24th): Depart from the Guiyang Guest House to visit the city and suburbs. The address of the reception office is the residence of Mao Guangxiang. After Mao disarmed, he retired to his original hometown in northern Guizhou. The house in the province is used by the provincial government to welcome guests. At 9 o'clock, the welcoming meeting of all sectors was held. Director Xue Yue and Chairman Han Deqin delivered speeches one after another. Then, Army Commander Yang Sen gave a speech on the importance of Guizhou Province, saying that it is located at the intersection of British and French territories. Now that there are many things happening in Europe, they have no time to look east. If Europe is ever free of troubles, they are very worried about the remote areas of Guizhou and Yunnan. Churches are lined up, and foreigners come and go in a constant stream. He hopes that the military and civilians will work hard to revitalize themselves in preparation for emergencies. Several divisions under Yang are stationed in Anshun, Yunnan and Guizhou, building roads along the way, which is very popular among the people in western Guizhou. The 20th Army of Xue is also very popular among the people in Guizhou. Part of it is the old army of Mr. Zhang Fakui, which has always been known as the Iron Army. It is now stationed in the former residence of Wang Jialie in Guiyang. Commander Ou Zhen is a direct descendant of Mr. Zhang. (Wang Jialie is now studying at the Army University in Beijing).

The climate in Guizhou Province is poor. "There are no three sunny days, and there are no 100 steps of flat ground." This spring, there was a sudden drought. Before the third major, there was a drizzle. Those who flattered us said that the touring group brought the timely rain. We dare not take it. The layout of the Guizhou Meteorological Observatory is still orderly, but unfortunately there is no funding, and the equipment is still not perfect. There are no specialized talents in the Geological Survey Institute. Three people were borrowed from Beijing to start doing survey and analysis work. The Land Survey Bureau has surveyed the vicinity of Guiyang and produced 16 sheets of "50,000-point" maps and 20 sheets of "10,000-point" maps after it was restored in the 24th year. Only 30% of the land in Guizhou Province is usable, but less than one-tenth of it has been cultivated. It is planned to promote the planting of tung trees and cotton. Because the frost period is too long, the harvest is poor. It is relatively possible to plant cotton in the south. The annual land tax in the province is 700,000, but the actual revenue is only 500,000. Although the Miao people in Huishan can be seen everywhere, there is no regular line. There are ore outcrops in more than 50 of the 81 counties in the province, but unfortunately, none of them are of much mining value. For example, coal and oil mines are taken and burned, but they dry up as soon as they are dug. Other minerals such as realgar and cinnabar have very small production volumes.

### The Military Affairs Commission Will Send Personnel to Sichuan Tomorrow to Film the Disaster Area

The Political Training Department and China National Aviation Corporation Donated Film and Airplane Tickets

The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association specially requested the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission yesterday to send personnel to Sichuan to film the disaster area.

They are scheduled to fly to Sichuan on a China National Aviation Corporation plane tomorrow (the 9th). The round-trip airplane tickets were donated by China National Aviation Corporation.

In order to allow all parties to clearly understand the extent of the disaster in the shortest possible time, this trip to Sichuan is intended to complete filming in a short period of time, and screenings can be held in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places in late this month.

Furthermore, it is reported that Li Qingfan, a member of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, received a letter from Nanjiang stating that the county was severely affected by the disaster but was listed as a lightly affected area, which was obviously unfair. Li Qingfan sent a telegram to Commissioner Cao Zhongzhi, requesting a detailed investigation. The telegram stated: "To Commissioner Cao Zhongzhi of Minzhong, after the successive Red disasters in Tongnan and Ba, there is also a drought disaster. Only Nanjiang is not listed as a severely affected area, which seems unfair. When you go to Ba and Tong to distribute relief, please conduct a detailed investigation nearby. Li Qingfan respectfully."

### A Large Number of Overseas Chinese Return Home to Avoid the Spanish War

Twenty-Two People Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday, Recounting the Dangers of Being Besieged in the City - A Spanish Woman Came Along

Twenty-three overseas Chinese from Spain returned to China on the French mail ship "Baodao Si" the day before yesterday to avoid the Spanish war. Their situation was extremely wretched. The names of the overseas Chinese are as follows: (1) Lin Liansong, 48 years old; (2) Wang Songjin, 23 years old; (3) Jin Maofei, 36 years old; (4) Yang Yaxiong, 40 years old; (5) Wu Zangyan, 31 years old; (6) Xu Cuimei, 35 years old; (7) Zhou Guoying, 32 years old; (8) Lin Kaoxian, 34 years old; (9) Wu Shengfu, 45 years old; (10) Chen Jingxun, 44 years old; (11) Zhou Couzhang, 41 years old; (12) Liu Wan'yu, 31 years old; (13) Lin Yanhan, 33 years old; (14) Liu Yanshang, 45 years old; (15) Sun Zengfei, 32 years old; (16) Wang Songfu, 29 years old; (17) Li Dingxiu, 29 years old; (18) Qiu Tingquan, 29 years old; (19) Jiang Songlin, 37 years old; (20) Wu Yanxu, 33 years old; (21) Liu Ling, over 30 years old, all from Qingtian, Zhejiang; (22) Shan Anjin, 32 years old (from Yongjia, Zhejiang).

Circumstances of Arrival: There is also a Spanish woman, Pilar Gregori Garces, 25 years old, who is the wife of overseas Chinese Liu Ling, whom he married in Spain. She also came with her husband this time. After arriving in Shanghai, the above overseas Chinese stayed at the Yuelai Hotel on Dagu Road, the Laogongxin Hotel on Wai Ma Road, the Wu Tongqin Inn on Xiaodongmen, and other inns in the French Concession. At 10:00 AM yesterday, they specially went to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau on Jiangxi Road to request relief. They were received by Jian Jinglun, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, and left at approximately 11:00 AM, returning to their respective inns.

Experiences of Evacuation: A Datong News Agency reporter met the overseas Chinese at the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau yesterday. According to overseas Chinese Xu Cuimei, they had lived in Spain for eight to fifteen years, engaged in business and peddling in Madrid. Since the outbreak of the war in the country, prices have soared and life has become difficult. Madrid is especially the target of the National Army's struggle, so it is extremely dangerous. Fortunately, they received the care of the Chinese Consulate in Spain and were able to leave Madrid on January 11, accompanying the consulate staff to Wanlin Line (near the coast and bordering France), about 380 miles from Madrid. Subsequently, on March 27, under the care of Hu Shixi, secretary of the consulate, they fled from Wanlin Line to Marseille, France, and were sent back to China on the "Baodao Si" ship by the consulate on the 2nd of last month, arriving in Shanghai yesterday.

Others Remaining: It was also said that although they usually had savings, when they left Madrid, they were only allowed to take four Spanish silver coins per person (equivalent to four jiao in Chinese auxiliary currency), resulting in a very wretched situation. As of now, there are still about 20 overseas Chinese living in the country, and there are still three people remaining in the besieged city of Madrid. One of them was injured by a stray bullet and is still being treated in the hospital. However, they have been abroad for many years and feel a strong sense of being unable to return home. Therefore, whether they will go to Nanjing to petition for relief is still under consideration.

### Actions of Two Overseas Chinese Aviators Yesterday

Visiting the Shanghai Branch of the Aviation Construction Association

Overseas Chinese youth aviators from Java, Xu Qi and Chen Yi'an, flew to Shanghai on the 5th of this month. Yesterday morning, they visited the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Aviation Construction Association in the city center, and were accompanied by Zhang Yuliang, the general manager of the association, to visit Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing and other standing committee members of the association. In the afternoon, they went to Longhua Airport to visit Dai Enji, general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, and had a two-hour conversation with Li Jinggun, general manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation. The gentlemen deeply praised the two gentlemen's superb skills and enthusiasm for protecting their motherland. Last night, Dai Enji hosted a banquet at Taolechun to welcome them. This afternoon, Mayor Yu specially invited them to participate in a banquet at the International Hotel, introducing them to leaders from the party, government, military, industry, and commerce in the city. In the evening, Du Yuesheng will host a banquet at the Hua'an Hotel to entertain them. The Aviation Construction Branch will hold a welcome banquet at the International Hotel on the 10th. The two gentlemen will stay in Shanghai for another three to five days. Xu's wife arrived in Hong Kong by ship yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on the 10th. Xu's wife is also enthusiastic about aviation and has excellent skills. It is said that after arriving in Shanghai, she will fly a plane with her husband to Nanjing, and then take a China National Aviation Corporation flight to Tianjin and Qingdao for a tour of about six weeks. It is also learned that Xu and Chen met in England and became close friends because of their shared interests. The plane they are flying was built by Xu himself and was completed in 1935, costing a total of 40,000 yuan. After returning to Java after completing his studies, he used this plane as a daily means of transportation to help his father take care of the company's business, as his father's food company is located throughout the South Seas, and travel by boat and car is very inconvenient. This shows Xu's profound experience in aviation.

### The Clothing System Research Association Sends Letters Soliciting Opinions

In order to Create Central Public Opinion and Contribute to Government Adoption

The Shanghai Silk Industry Association, the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association, and the Lake Society Committee, considering that the Ministry of Interior is about to revise the clothing system regulations, in addition to petitioning in Nanjing last month to state their opinions, have now formed a Clothing System Research Association in order to contribute to the government's adoption. Yesterday, the chairman of the association, Luo Qinghua, convened a meeting. The committee members Ji En, Niu Zhizi, Wu Xingwei, Lou Fengdiao, Jin Haoqing, Shen Zicha, Gao Shiheng, Yuan Weichen, Shen Tianhua, Shen Zhengxiang, Pan Runsheng and others attended. Chairman Luo Qinghua reported the purpose of the meeting. It was resolved to invite Jin Yixiang, Zhang Binghui, Jiang Xiaopeng, Ding Song, Shen Xiling, Zhang Qianying, Ye Qianyu, Liang Baibo, Yan Duhe, Yan Esheng, Zeng Xubai, Pan Yangyao, Jiang Zhigang and others to participate in the association's brainstorming to discuss import methods, plan to publish newspaper awards to solicit pattern papers, and pass letters to industry associations and related organizations across the country to solicit opinions. The letter stated: "Since the clothing system regulations of our country were formulated by the Ministry of Interior in April of the 18th year, it has been eight years. Because it was hastily completed at that time, it was not beautiful. Now that unity has been achieved and all government affairs are waiting to be dealt with, there is a move to revise the clothing system regulations. This association believes that the regulation of clothing systems is related to the national image and the people's livelihood economy. It is appropriate to collect the opinions of all and carefully consider them. It should also take into account the people's livelihood and promote domestic products. Silk is a special product of our country and a rural sideline. If the formulated regulations are not suitable for silk production, then the silk industry of our country will flourish, and the people's livelihood economy can still be asked. Therefore, at present, representatives are sent to Nanjing to petition and state opinions. It is hoped that there will be suggestions for various styles for adoption. Therefore, relevant organizations are invited to form a clothing system research committee, in addition to publishing newspaper awards to collect pattern papers, so as to contribute to government adoption, and printing booklets to distribute to relevant government agencies and organizations, in order to create central public opinion and promote the silk industry. We have always admired your association's leadership of the silk industry and its enthusiasm. Therefore, we specially send this letter to solicit opinions and look forward to being informed at any time."

### Joint Transportation on Three Routes Rents Sleeping Cars

### The Coal Industry Association Cables Request to Stop the Transfer of the Liujiang Coal Mine

In Order to Protect Mineral Rights and Protect Resources

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association yesterday telegraphed the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Resources Committee, and the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, requesting that the transfer of the Heishanyao Coal Mine and Railway belonging to the Huashang Liujiang Coal Mine Company to the Taiji Coal Mine Company be stopped, in order to value national enterprises. The original telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, the Resources Committee, and the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, we respectfully report that the Huashang Liujiang Coal Mine Railway Co., Ltd. is a successful enterprise in the mining industry of Hebei Province, with excellent coal quality, complete mining and transportation facilities, and a superior location. The mine area is only thirty li from the port, which is a convenience that is difficult for other coal mines in the country to obtain. In March of the year before last, all the coal reserves, railway warehouses, and other properties in the mine area were forcibly seized by the Taiji Company, a Sino-Japanese joint venture, taking advantage of the local incident in North China. The Liujiang Company repeatedly sent letters to the association requesting it to uphold justice and provide legal assistance, and notified the industry to refuse to sell the Liujiang coal transported to Shanghai by the Taiji Company as stolen coal. The association repeatedly deliberated and believed that the points requested by the company were all correct. In order to respect national resources and the company's mineral rights, it once upheld justice and made every effort to assist in accordance with the association's regulations. Now we have learned that Zhu Yicai, chairman of the board of directors of the Liujiang Company, and Shen Jinzhou, general manager, for the benefit of a few people, disregarding national sovereignty and losing resources, dared to transfer all the coal reserves, railway warehouses, and other properties in the Liujiang mine area to the Taiji Company for 660,000 yuan. According to the letter sent by the Liujiang Company to the association on September 10, 1935, 'Our company has a mining boundary dispute with the Taiji Company, a Sino-Japanese joint venture in the neighboring mine. After repeated negotiations, the Japanese were unreasonable. Subsequently, on August 21, Gao Jiuxin, the Japanese representative of the company, led more than ten Japanese in the name of acting as an agent to forcibly estimate all the properties of the Liujiang mine. Their illegal behavior is obvious,' etc. The company previously pointed out that the Taiji Company's behavior was illegal, but now it sells all its mineral rights and properties to the Taiji Company, which is inevitably greedy and forgets righteousness, and contradicts itself before and after, humiliating the country. The association finds it difficult to remain silent on this matter. In addition to the public deliberation and sanction measures in accordance with the association's regulations, we specially telegraph your department, requesting that you immediately and strictly order the Liujiang Company not to transfer its mineral rights and all its properties to the Taiji Company, in order to protect mineral rights and protect resources. We are extremely hopeful. The Shanghai Coal Industry Association kowtows."

### The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company Held a Board Meeting Yesterday

Increased Stock to Remedy Rising Material Prices, Discussed Raising Half of the Paid-Up Capital

Domestic financial circles invested in the construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and established the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Chartered Co., Ltd. with a capital of 20 million yuan, raising half of it and establishing a general office in Shanghai to manage finance, technology, and various affairs. It also sent personnel to Paris to set up a material purchasing office to supervise the purchase of materials such as sleepers and steel rails. Since the road started construction on April 1, the roadbed project has been progressing smoothly, but the various materials required have risen sharply in the international market, which is far from the previously budgeted price. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, the third board meeting was held in the general office to discuss remedial measures. All the official and merchant shareholders in Shanghai, namely Che Zengyangfu, Du Zhenyuan, Gan Jiyong, Wang Yibo, Hu Bijang, Ye Zuotang, Xu Xinliu, Zhu Zi'an, Liu Zhujun, Xu Ziqing, Yang Jiemei, and Li Shizeng, attended, and Jiang Jiamei, the secretary in attendance. Chairman Zeng Gaifu presided over the meeting. It is reported that the focus of the board meeting was to increase the capital stock, which will be decided by the board of directors in accordance with Article 5 of the company's articles of association, and then raise another half of the 10 million yuan to purchase materials. Other issues such as project progress and the acquisition of land along the line will also be reported and discussed. The company, considering the severity of the drought in Sichuan and to save expenses, does not intend to hold a groundbreaking ceremony separately. This point also needs to be decided by the board of directors.

### China Tea Company to Commence Operations on the 10th

The China Tea Company, after holding a joint meeting of directors and supervisors in Beijing on the 1st of this month, has decided to commence operations on the 10th of this month. The address has been confirmed as Kenye Building, 25 Beijing Road. Yesterday, Mr. Shou Jingwei, the general manager of the company, stated that the company's operating rules and the first year's business plan summary have been decided.

The Ministry of Industries will subsidize 15,000 yuan for his salary and other expenses, and the remainder will be jointly raised by the Agricultural and Commercial Bank and the China Tea Company.

Furthermore, the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Association is chaired by Mr. Liu Yiyan, the Director of the Anhui Construction Department. At a previous meeting in Beijing, he expressed agreement with the Ministry of Industries' overall plan to promote tea throughout the country. However, this year's Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea General Marketing Office is hosted by Jiangxi Province, so a considerable cooperation plan has been drafted, and it can be implemented after obtaining the consent of the Anhui and Jiangxi provincial authorities. The central government, local governments, and tea merchants across the country are working together to promote the development of foreign trade, and their suggestions have been approved by Minister Wu and Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Industries, as well as all directors and supervisors.

The company's rules are outlined below:

Article 1: These rules are based on Article 28 of the company's articles of association.

Article 2: The general manager of the company shall, under the direction of the board of directors, preside over all affairs of the company. Assistant managers shall assist the general manager in handling company affairs.

### Postal Officer Luo Dezhong Accused of Embezzling Airmail Letters

The Letters Contained 18 Winning Aviation Tickets; Another Letter Containing a 6,000 Yuan Draft Was Lost; Postal Inspectors Discovered Evidence

Luo Dezhong, a postal officer at the Fujian Road Post Office from this county, is suspected of embezzling 18 winning aviation lottery tickets worth a total of 1,100 yuan sent by the Yunkang Company in Yunnan. After investigation by Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Head Pang Ruixiang of the Old Concession Police Station, they requested a summons from the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Luo Dezhong was summoned to the criminal court, where Criminal Court President Qian Hongye presided over the trial.

Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated that the Yunyu Yunkang Company sent an airmail registered letter to Zhicheng Company (i.e., Yunkang Shanghai Branch) at 78 Beiwuxi Road, Shanghai, in February of this year. The letter contained 18 winning aviation lottery tickets with a total prize money of 1,100 yuan. Zhicheng Company did not receive the letter. On March 9, Zhicheng Company received a letter from the Yunkang Company in Yunnan and discovered the loss. They reported it to the postal authorities, who dispatched inspectors Wang Baohua and Hong Sunxiang to investigate.

The investigation revealed that the Fujian Road Post Office received a total of 982 letters on February 22. Among them, 905 letters were sent out as instructed. There were still 77 letters, either because they could not be delivered, or because they were official postal letters, or because the seals were not secure (i.e., so-called junk mail). According to postal regulations, the post office would send a receipt to the recipient for these unsecured letters, and the recipient would stamp the receipt and personally pick up the letter from the post office. Yunkang's letter was among these 77 letters, with a registration number of 302. However, the letter had already been claimed by someone who stamped the receipt with the words "Yunzhin Shanghai Branch Telegraph Receipt." However, Zhicheng Company absolutely denied receiving the letter, stating that letters sent from Yunkang to Shanghai were always stamped with the Zhicheng Shanghai Branch Telegraph Receipt stamp, and never with the above-mentioned stamp.

After investigation by the post office, it was confirmed that this was the case. Further investigation revealed that according to postal practice, after the post office receives a registered letter, the postal worker who receives it must register the number and then distribute it to the postman in charge of the area for delivery. The postman must also note it in his own receipt book after receiving the letter, and the letter receiver on that day was the defendant Luo Dezhong, and the postman was Zhang Shiming, number 715. It was found that Zhang received 14 letters that day, and they were all noted in his book as having been delivered without error. However, there was no letter numbered 302, which shows that Zhang did not receive the letter. There is no doubt about it. The defendant's register should have recorded the letter numbered 302, but all the other letters were registered except for this letter, which is suspicious. Furthermore, when the recipient presents the receipt to the post office to claim the letter, the clerk only glances at the stamp, and there are many such situations every day, so he cannot remember the stamp on each receipt. However, in the report that the defendant submitted to the post office after the incident, he was able to recall the words on the stamp of receipt number 302 completely and accurately, which is also suspicious. In addition, the postman's number stamp on the receipt was blurred. In the same month, a registered letter containing a 6,000 yuan draft was lost at the Fujian Central Post Office, and the letter was also handled by the defendant Luo Dezhong. It was found that the defendant had been working at the post office for more than ten years, and his financial situation had been quite strained recently. It is possible that he took this action as a last resort. The defendant had threatened Zhang Shiming, instructing him to admit that he had delivered the receipt for registered letter number 302 to Zhicheng Company, otherwise he would be dismissed.

Due to these suspicions, the police station charged him with business embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The prize money for the 18 lottery tickets had already been claimed from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China. The police station must take the defendant to the three banks to inquire whether the claimant was the defendant. Therefore, they requested that the defendant be detained.

Wang Baohua and Hong Sunxiang submitted a report on the investigation process. Zhang Shiming testified that he did not receive the receipt to deliver to Zhicheng Company. Wang Yuntang, the manager of Zhicheng Company, denied having the "Yunzhin Shanghai Branch Telegraph Receipt" stamp. When questioned, the defendant Luo Dezhong confessed that the receipt had indeed been given to Zhang Shiming for delivery and denied the fact of embezzlement. After reviewing the confessions, the criminal court president decided to postpone the trial for a week. Luo Dezhong was detained.

### Chinese Detective Han Juncai Dies in the Line of Duty; Universal Respect and Mourning

The Body Was Examined Yesterday Morning; The Principal Will Provide Compensation; The Funeral Will Be Held on the 10th; All Police Officers Will Attend

Han Juncai, a 26-year-old Chinese detective number 611 from Hebei at the Avenue Joffre French Police Station, went on duty at 9:20 AM on the 6th. While patrolling at the intersection of Route des Peres and Tangjia Bay, he encountered kidnappers attempting to kidnap Cao Qiming, the owner of Songlu at 58 Alley 16, Route des Peres. At the critical moment, Detective Han rushed to arrest them. Due to the large number of kidnappers, he was outnumbered. He fired his gun at the kidnappers. He was shot and critically wounded by the kidnappers who were resisting arrest and died on the spot. The kidnappers abandoned the hostage and fled in all directions, firing shots along the way, injuring several male and female pedestrians with stray bullets.

The French Police Station dispatched a large number of detectives to pursue the kidnappers upon hearing the news. The kidnappers had already fled far away without a trace. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, and Detective Han's body was taken to the autopsy room attached to the Municipal Council Hospital (commonly known as the small hospital) on Tairas Road for examination. All the details were reported in yesterday's newspaper.

Yesterday morning, the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office appointed Prosecutor Dong Qihong to visit the hospital with a forensic doctor and clerk to examine the body in accordance with the law. He first heard the case report from Chinese and Western detectives and the testimony of Cao Renfu, the chauffeur of the victim Cao Qiming, about the kidnapping of his master and the shooting death of Detective Han. Han Zhangshi, the detective’s widow, filed a case requesting to claim the body for burial and to bring the murderers to justice. Prosecutor Dong ruled that Han Juncai died from a gunshot wound and handed over the body to his widow, Han Zhangshi, for burial. The Police Department will strictly investigate the criminals and bring them to justice.

After the examination, it was heard that the victim Cao Qiming first gave 500 yuan for funeral expenses and handed it over to the police station for the family of the deceased to handle the funeral. All the personnel of the police station mourned the death of Detective Han in the line of duty. They decided to attend the funeral at 10:00 AM next Monday (the 10th). It is said that the Public Concession and the Municipal Police Bureau will also send personnel to participate in the funeral. The compensation part will be reported to the superiors by the police superintendent for generous compensation. The victim Cao Qiming will also allocate a considerable amount of condolence money.

### Jealous Murderer Sentenced

Ma Aken Sentenced to Ten Years

Ma Aken, a painter from Tongzhou, had an affair with Wu Suzhen, a woman living at 27 North Fujian Road. Later, Wu had an affair with an old boatman named Age. When Ma saw this, he went to Wu to negotiate on the 15th of last month. They disagreed and a conflict broke out. Ma stabbed Wu Suzhen in a vital spot with a sharp blade, killing her instantly. Ma then stabbed himself three times with the knife and fell to the ground injured.

The Huishi Police Station received a report and Detective Shen Dehui went to take Ma to the hospital for treatment and to take Wu's body to the morgue. After Ma recovered from his injuries, he was sent to the First Court. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted him for murder. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Chuan Lin of the Criminal Court 8 sentenced Ma Aken to ten years in prison for murder. The evidence in storage will be claimed later.

### Caojiadu Police Station Cracks Down on Gambling Den

Twenty-Three Gamblers Detained

The Caojiadu Police Station in western Shanghai received a tip yesterday morning around 1:00 AM that a local man named Ma Jisheng had set up a private gambling den at 75 Qianjia Lane, Jessfield Road, enticing people to gamble and profiting from the racket. The police station, upon receiving the report, dispatched Inspector Zhao E to lead the police to the scene and rushed into the door. At that time, Ma Jisheng and the gamblers were shaking dice, shouting and drinking. When they suddenly saw the police arrive, they all looked at each other in dismay. Inspector Zhao arrested the gambling boss and 23 gamblers, including Ma Gentao, Yang Liansheng, Ma Fugen, and Yang Tangshi, and took them to the police station along with the gambling tools and gambling money. After a brief interrogation by Criminal Police Officer Xing, he prepared a document and sent the 23 gamblers directly to the District Court for investigation.

### Municipal Council's Recommendations on the Maid Question

The Board of Directors Decided to Adopt Them

In February of this year, the Municipal Council decided to begin studying the policy on the maid question and appointed Ms. Xin De, director of the Municipal Council's Factory Affairs Management Office, to supervise the work of maids. One of Ms. Xin's tasks was to collect news and information so that the Municipal Council could consider and decide whether to implement registration or take other measures. Ms. Xin has submitted a recommendation to the Police Committee of the Bureau, explaining her views on the work she is doing. The recommendations are divided into one item, which is described as follows:

1.  It is proposed to invite the China Women and Children Relief Association to recommend a qualified female consultant for consultation at any time.
2.  It is proposed to select an area as a pilot area. The area has a number of women who are maids in other people's families, and the family conditions of these people are investigated in detail. Maid incidents are studied individually, and then the whole problem can be understood.
3.  It is proposed to hire a female assistant who has been trained in social work to assist Ms. Xin in performing the above work.

The above three recommendations were unanimously agreed by the chairman and members of the Police Committee of the Municipal Council, and the committee requested the board of directors to approve them. At a meeting on the 6th of this month, the board of directors decided to approve them as proposed.

### Ronin Plot to Establish Smuggling Organization on Japanese Ships

Attempting to Secretly Hide Cameras for Smuggling; Customs Officers Say It Is Not Difficult to Detect

According to Shenzhou News Agency, since smuggling has become rampant in this city and four customs officers have been beaten by Japanese and Korean ronin, all parties have paid close attention. The government and customs authorities have protested to the Japanese. The reporter learned from relevant sources that the Japanese have not yet responded to the protest submitted by our side as of yesterday. However, the Japanese and Korean ronin believe that customs officers are risking danger and bravely cracking down on smuggling, so in recent days, smuggled goods have been greatly reduced. Only sporadic seafood is being smuggled to evade taxes. Therefore, these ronin have decided to establish smuggling organizations on various Japanese ships in an attempt to secretly hide smuggled goods for smuggling, thereby avoiding the eyes and ears of customs officers.

When the Japanese and Korean ronin smuggled silver out of the country two years ago, they used this method. At that time, no less than 600,000 to 700,000 yuan of silver was smuggled out every day. Fortunately, the customs officers found a way to crack down on them one by one. According to customs officers, although the ronin have many tricks, it is not difficult to crack down on them in the end. They are currently intensifying their investigations.

### Ancient Book Lawsuit Sent Back for Retrial

Wang Liting Denies Stealing Books; Judge Advises to Settle Out of Court

Author:

Xu Jiaheng, a wealthy man from Songjiang, had an older sister who married Wang Liting, a wealthy man from Tinglin, Songjiang. They were originally close relatives, but suddenly 1,130 books inherited from Xu Jiaheng's ancestors, worth a huge amount of money, disappeared. They were found in Wang's Shanghai residence. He reported it to the police station, and Wang and the books were arrested and sent to the inland court.

The case was heard by the Shanghai Local Court. In the first instance, Judge Tan Zhuohong presided over the trial and Wang Liting was sentenced to imprisonment. However, before the sentencing, Tan had instructed his co-conspirator, lawyer Yang Shaopeng, to solicit bribes unsuccessfully, and then he was found guilty. Therefore, he was reported by the defense lawyer, so Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng were sued in the Jiangsu High Court. This case is also the first case. For this reason, this case was sent back for retrial by the Third Instance Court. Yesterday, Judge Wang opened the court for trial.

Xu Jiaheng testified that he was 29 years old, from Songjiang, and lived in Songjiang Central City. In July of the 24th year, he reported to the Lujiawan Police Station and sent Western Detective Aimu to Raffel Road to arrest Wang. At that time, Wang Liting was arrested along with 1,130 books. The books were inherited from my ancestors and were all signed and stamped by my grandfather. They were donated to the temple, but because it was not built, they were still kept in my place, etc.

Wang Liting testified that he was 37 years old, lived in Tinglin, Songjiang, and in the summer of the 24th year, because he was seeing a doctor at Guangci Hospital and his wife was about to give birth, he moved to the front building at 559 Raffel Road to live temporarily. He usually lived in Songjiang. The books were given to me by my mother-in-law many years ago and were not stolen, etc.

The court instructed that the lawsuit had been going on for several years, and the two parties should still settle out of court. The case was adjourned for further hearing.

### Seeking to Eliminate the Boundaries Between Han and Miao Peoples, Planning to Form the Southwest Border Association

Outlining the Origins and Principles of the Organization, Gao Yuzhu Declines Social Engagements to Actively Prepare

Ms. Gao Yuzhu, a representative of the chieftain and people of the Yi ethnic group in Southwest China, and Mr. Xie Yujie, after traveling tens of thousands of miles to petition in Beijing, have come to Shanghai for a second time, receiving a warm welcome from all sectors. Ms. Gao and others, in order to thoroughly eliminate the boundaries between Han and Miao peoples and promote Miao culture, have initiated preparations for the establishment of the Southwest Border Development Association. They have already obtained the support of over two hundred individuals, including Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan; Fang Juehui and Lai Lian, members of the Central Committee; Jian Zhe, Surveillance Commissioner; Ding Chaowu; and prominent figures from this city, such as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Ji Juemi, Jian Youwen, and Lu Danlin. The organizational principles of the association have also been drafted. After another preparatory meeting in the coming days, an inaugural general assembly will be convened to jointly plan the endeavor. Details are as follows:

Origins of the Organization (Original text): For sixty years, our China has been engaged in the liberation movement. In the most recent six years, the lessons given to us by foreign powers have served only to promote the internal unity of our nation. The name "China" implies five ethnic groups, yet the Northeast was lost through inaction, leaving North China in a precarious state. The defense line of a country is closely tied to its borders, and the security of the border areas is closely tied to its ethnic groups. Our country's border ethnic groups include the Manchus and Mongols in the Northeast, the Hui and Tibetans in the Northwest, and the Yi and Miao in the Southwest. With the loss of the eastern corner, the setting sun shines on the Shu region. In recent years, the central government's management of the Northwest has been a case of mending the fold after the sheep are lost, which cannot be said to lack foresight. The Yi and Miao in the Southwest have a population of tens of millions and a land area of hundreds of thousands of miles, yet for thousands of years, the people of the country have paid little attention. At a time when national crisis is pressing, the Southwest's strategic importance is no less than that of the Northeast, and its wealth surpasses that of the Northwest. Since the founding of the Republic of China, it has been situated between two major powers and has ultimately been able to enjoy peace, thanks to the Yi people's strong desire for unity and the Miao people's inherently peaceful nature. However, due to the perilous roads and different cultures, the central lands of China regarded them as isolated areas, while foreigners actively sought to invade them. As the saying goes, "A common man is not guilty, but he is guilty of possessing jade." Now, the Yi and Miao, as culturally backward ethnic groups, occupy rich and strategically important lands. If they do not work together to establish defenses and development, their fate will likely be no different from that of the Northeast. I believe that to resist foreign aggression, we must start with uniting the ethnic groups; to unite the ethnic groups, we must start with strengthening our forces; to strengthen our forces, we must start with promoting culture, developing production, and consolidating the borders. Truly, regeneration depends on self-reliance, and nothing is easier than achieving great things through collective effort. We are moved by the border people's sincere desire for good governance and by the fact that the fate of the nation hangs by a thread in a corner. Therefore, we have established the Southwest Border Development Association. The process will involve: first, investigation; second, construction; and third, development. Apart from major political and military matters, which will be handled by the government, all other undertakings will rely on the assistance of prominent figures in society. If we can proceed in an orderly manner, not only will the people's livelihood be improved, but it will also contribute to national defense, and the foundation for the revival of the entire nation will be strengthened and secure. The organizational principles are attached on a separate sheet. We hope that you will consider the national crisis and actively participate. This is our sincere hope.

Organizational Principles: ⑴ The association is named the Southwest Border Development Association. ⑵ The association aims to unite the spirit of the nation, develop the Southwest border, promote culture, and facilitate construction. ⑶ The general headquarters of the association will be located in Shanghai and Nanjing, with branches established in various provinces and cities, and offices established in various locations in the Southwest border region. ⑷ People of the Republic of China, regardless of gender, who support the association's objectives, assist the association's activities, and are willing to abide by the association's constitution and have gone through legal procedures to join the association, may become members of the association. The association's membership is divided into two categories: group members and individual members. Individual members are divided into three categories: honorary members, basic members, and ordinary members. Members of the association have the right to priority investment in development (detailed rules to be determined separately). ⑸ The highest authority of the association is the general assembly of all members. When the general assembly is not in session, the highest authority is the board of directors and supervisors. The general assembly of all members elects a number of directors and supervisors to form the board of directors and the board of supervisors. The board of directors elects a number of standing directors. The organizational law of the association is governed by the Regulations on the Organization of People's Organizations. The organizational regulations of the association will be formulated separately. ⑹ The association will have one director-general, one deputy director-general, and a number of staff members, who will be appointed by the association. The association will have the following departments: general affairs department (with four sections: documentation, accounting, public relations, and general services); investigation department (with two sections: investigation and publicity); research department (with two sections: academic and design); construction department (with four sections: education, transportation, water conservancy, and health); development department (with three sections: agriculture, industry, mining, animal husbandry, and planting). The heads of each department will be appointed by the board of directors, and their responsibilities and detailed rules of operation will be determined separately. ⑺ The association must formulate a work plan and implement it step by step. When necessary, it may establish various specialized committees, such as an economic committee and an education committee. The organizational law of these committees will be determined separately. ⑻ The association's funding is divided into recurrent expenses and project expenses. Recurrent expenses are covered by membership fees. If these are insufficient, the association may apply for subsidies from the central and local governments and solicit donations from public and private organizations and individuals. Membership fees will be determined separately. Project expenses will be raised through investment from entrepreneurs. ⑼ The association will be established by the founders jointly organizing and preparing all matters. During the period before the association is formally established, the preparatory committee will be responsible in its name. The effectiveness of the preparatory committee will cease on the date of the establishment of the general assembly. ⑽ Detailed rules and organizational laws of the association will be drafted by the preparatory committee and will come into effect after being revised and approved by the general assembly. They must also be submitted to the government for registration in accordance with the law. ⑾ The proposed plan will be applicable after being revised and approved by the preparatory meeting.

Circulars to Various Sectors: Ms. Gao and other founders, in order to expedite the establishment of the general assembly, have sent circulars to various sectors requesting sincere assistance to achieve complete success. The original circular is as follows: Dear Sir/Madam, We, Gao Yuzhu and Xie Yujie, representing the chieftains, officials and people of the southwestern ethnic minorities, travelled thousands of miles to Beijing to petition the central government, and we are deeply grateful for the central government's kind intentions and for the adoption of all our requests. The border people are all bathed in benevolence. We are fortunate to have completed our mission and lived up to our heavy trust, for which we are especially grateful. Having been born in the remote border area, our hearts yearn for civilization. Since setting foot in the Central Plains, we have witnessed modern civilization and our desire for good governance has become even stronger. After returning, we will strive to cultivate and develop ourselves, and work hard to promote education, so that future development and construction can achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, being in a remote border area, we are ashamed of our ignorance. Being situated in a mountainous corner, we are not aware of external affairs. We must rely on our fellow compatriots to not abandon the border people and to provide guidance in order to achieve success. Recalling our visits to various places in Beijing and Shanghai, we were given generous reception, sincere attention, guidance, and encouragement by wise men from all walks of life, which we believe will not be in vain. However, the mountains and rivers are far apart, and it is not easy to receive instruction. It is difficult to express our heartfelt feelings. In our humble opinion, the best way is to organize a permanent group called the Southwest Border Development Association, in order to connect feelings, communicate information, gather public opinion, and study plans to assist the border administration and provide guidance for construction. In this way, the ethnic minorities in the southwest will benefit endlessly, and the defense of the border can be consolidated. What's more, we were honored to receive the kindness of all sectors, including generous hospitality, many treasures, and pleasant gatherings. We are deeply grateful and feel very attached to the farewells that are approaching. Meetings are not accidental, and separations should leave something behind. If there is such an organization, then we can stay in contact across a thousand miles, separate in form but united in spirit, receive education in a proper way, and have something to follow. Our private hearts are filled with joy. Sir/Madam, you have always been deeply concerned about the ethnic minorities, and we are honored to have received your love. We believe that this move will be approved by you. Therefore, we dare to ask you to be listed as a founder, to make a call to the public, and to receive responses from all over the mountains.

We humbly submit the rationale and organizational principles for your consideration and correction. Please sign and drop off the signature card as soon as possible, so that the association can be established quickly. We await your response with anticipation. Respectfully, Gao Yuzhu and Xie Yujie.

Active Preparations: Ms. Gao Yuzhu told a reporter from the Dagong News Agency yesterday that she has been very grateful and inspired by the love and praise she has received from all parties in recent days. Various schools and organizations have invited her to give speeches, which she originally did not dare to refuse. However, in recent days, she has been dealing with all kinds of matters related to the preparation of the association, and she has had no free time. Therefore, she plans to temporarily decline any social engagements from all sectors starting today, so that she can actively prepare and carefully handle the work of the association. She hopes that all parties will understand her difficulties and help her to succeed.

### Jiangnan Railway Leases the Connecting Line Between the Beijing-Shanghai Railway

Lease Term of 15 Years

The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration and the Jiangnan Railway Company have jointly built a connecting line between the Zhonghua Gate and Yaohua Gate in Nanjing to facilitate intermodal transport. The section of the track between the Zhonghua Gate and the Qinhuai River was built by the Jiangnan Railway, while the section of the track between the Yaohua Gate and the Qinhuai River was built by the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration. The entire line is 22 kilometers long. Since the line was completed and opened to traffic in April last year, traffic between Wuhu, Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places has been greatly facilitated. It is reported that in order to facilitate management, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway plans to lease the 15.45-kilometer section of the track between the Yaohua Gate and the Qinhuai River, which was built by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, to the Jiangnan Railway Company for management. All tracks, buildings, and land will be leased by the Jiangnan Railway Company, which will pay rent twice a year. The rent is calculated at an annual rate of 5% of the assessed construction cost of the route, which is 30,000 yuan in national currency. The lease term is 15 years, and neither party may terminate the lease during the term. During the term of the contract, all operating revenue on the track will belong entirely to the Jiangnan Railway Company, and all operations will be managed by the Jiangnan Railway. In addition, the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway will be responsible for completing the stone mine that has not yet been filled, the crossing guard houses at each level crossing, the platform edges and surfaces at the Baishuiqiao station, and the unfinished road surfaces. The two parties have negotiated and agreed on the terms and have drafted a contract, which has been jointly submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways has approved it and that the contract will be formally signed soon.

Chairman Starr reported on the business situation, stating that last year was a period of economic depression in Chinese society, but the company's spirit of loyal service and hard work resulted in a good victory, which was truly commendable. The company's investments are undoubtedly on a path of increasingly stable and beneficial development, which not only demonstrates the company's financial stability, but also shows the reliability of the life insurance business.

### The Shanghai Branch of the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee Reports on the Tragic Situation in Guizhou

The Shanghai China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, located at 97 Renji Road, has already allocated funds and sent personnel to investigate and distribute relief for the Henan disaster, but its resources are insufficient. It is also making every effort to provide relief to Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, and other provinces, and is seeking assistance from all sectors. The committee yesterday received a letter from the Guizhou China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, strongly pleading for relief for the province. The tragic situation is unbearable to read. The original letter is as follows: "Guizhou is a barren area, and agricultural production has always been insufficient. Since Guizhou has suffered from banditry and natural disasters, its vitality has been greatly damaged, and the rural areas have declined, resulting in a daily decline in production. The people's food supply has become a problem. Last year's severe drought affected more than forty counties, and the harvest barely covered four-tenths of the cost. The central government has successively issued more than 300,000 yuan in relief loans, and the provincial government has scraped together tens of thousands of yuan to organize grain sales. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it can slightly reduce the disaster. We were hoping for a good harvest in the first half of this year to help regulate the people's food supply from April until the autumn harvest. Therefore, the government encouraged people to pay special attention to planting buckwheat as a precaution. Unexpectedly, the autumn drought was already severe, and the spring drought followed. Since last summer, there has not been a single drop of rain. The sun has been scorching for months, the fields are cracked, the spring crops are withered, and the water sources in various places are exhausted, causing a shortage of drinking water. The food supply is dwindling day by day. The spring harvest, which we relied on for several months of survival, has now been completely lost. Even if there is a heavy rain that does not delay the spring planting, the source of food for famine relief in the coming months will have been completely lost. Due to the inconvenient transportation in Guizhou Province, if we do not take early action to rescue the people, we will have no choice but to watch them die. Recalling the scenes of corpses lying exposed and villages being wiped out in 1925, we are still terrified. The struggle for fern roots and tree bark, and the rampant looting of food, are only the beginning of the disaster. Now, rice prices are soaring, and people are panicking. The government is finding it difficult to provide relief, and the people are suffering from a lack of means to prolong their lives. The days are long, and families are crying in the streets. Who can avert the great disaster that is coming? We are witnessing this with our own eyes and are deeply concerned, but our strength is weak and we are ashamed of our inability to reverse the situation. In addition to appealing to the central government to quickly issue a large sum of money for immediate relief, we hope that the Committee, as a savior of disaster victims that is admired both at home and abroad, will provide strong assistance, broadly publicize and solicit donations, and provide as much guidance as possible on relief methods, so that the great disaster can be averted and the disaster victims can continue their lives. We are sending this telegram with great urgency and await your instructions."

### Chamber of Commerce Explains that Delivery Orders Should Have Stamps Affixed

Regarding the issue of affixing stamps to delivery orders, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce replied to the Shanghai Forwarding and Customs Brokers Association yesterday, stating: "In response to your letter of the 6th of this month, regarding whether the delivery order drafted by the Tongtai Customs Brokerage should have stamps affixed, etc., we have attached a sample to the meeting for inspection. The sample states, 'Please deliver the goods under the name of XX number, totaling XX, to the person coming to load and transport them to XX place without error.' Based on the circumstances, the transportation company relies on this delivery order to collect the consigned goods, which is the 'document for collecting goods' specified in item 5 of the stamp tax law. For any item valued at three yuan or more, a two-cent stamp should be affixed to each item."

### Shanghai Women's Circle Hosted a Banquet for a Japanese Female Reporter Yesterday

After arriving in Shanghai a few days ago, she invited leaders of the women's circle in this city to hold a forum the day before yesterday afternoon, during which they exchanged opinions on women's movements and strengthened the bonds between women in the two countries, and conducted genuine and thorough critiques. It is known that more than thirty prominent figures from the women's circle in this city, including Lu Limeng, Lin Kecong, Wang Xiaoying, Jin Guangmei, Shen Ziwei, Yan Zhenwang, Huang Birao, Wang Ruqi, and Jiang Yixiao, hosted a joint banquet for Ms. Ishiwara at the Dadong Restaurant yesterday evening at 7:00 PM, and invited Ms. Kono Roko, a reporter for the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, and Ms. Yamashima, a reporter for the Shanghai News, to accompany them, in order to show their gratitude and do their part as hosts. During the banquet, the guests and hosts chatted and enjoyed themselves, creating a very harmonious atmosphere. The banquet ended at around 9:00 PM.

### Fiji Bans the Export of Golden Silk Grass to China

Western-style Hat Industry Requests Negotiations

Our country's western-style hat industry relies on purchasing Philippine golden silk grass and Italian glass grass as raw materials, with Fijian golden silk grass being the main import. Since the Fijian authorities proposed banning the export of golden silk grass to China last year, our country's western-style hat industry has been quite alarmed and has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Industry to forward the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate and stop the ban, in order to maintain the western-style hat business. It is known that the Fijian authorities' ban will be implemented in August of this year. After approving the request from the Ministry of Industry, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed the embassy in the United States to negotiate a stop to the ban.

### Kang Yuan Can Factory Increases Capital by One Million Yuan

Shareholders' Ordinary Meeting Held Today

According to the Industrial Association, Kang Yuan Can Factory Co., Ltd. in this city has decided to increase its capital by one million yuan in order to step up production and expand its business. The capital is divided into 20,000 shares, which will be offered to the old shareholders on a priority basis. It is known that the company's increased capital has now been fully subscribed.

The company has already sent letters to all shareholders yesterday, notifying them to attend on time.

### The Sex of Horses, Mules, Poultry, and Livestock Should All Be Changed to Male and Female

The Words "Pin" and "Mu" Are Easily Confused in Pronunciation; Uniform Names Are Used to Avoid Divergence

The Ministry of Finance approved the letter from the Ministry of Industry, etc., stating that henceforth, the sex of horses, mules, and other poultry and livestock should all be changed to male and female, and ordered subordinate agencies to forward the notification to all known locations. The document stated, "It has been found that flying creatures are called 'cixiong' (male and female), while walking creatures are called 'pinmu' (female and male), which can be verified in the poems and commentaries of Dai. However, education has not yet been popularized in our country, and the public distinguishes the sex of horses and mules as either 'cixiong' or 'gongmu' (male and female). If we show them 'pinmu', the pronunciation is wrong and easily confused. At this time of improving breeding stallions and increasing horse production, there is direct and indirect contact with the public. In order to be popular, simple, clear, and easy to understand, henceforth, the sex of horses, mules, and their poultry and livestock should all be changed to male and female, so as to avoid divergence and facilitate unification." The case was submitted to the Executive Yuan on March 30 and approved by directive No. 1256. In addition to sending separate letters, the letter requested that the relevant department be notified and instructed to change the usage accordingly.

### Material Merchants Eagerly Promote the Railway Ministry's Material Purchase Promissory Notes

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, since the establishment of the Material Purchase Committee by the Railway Ministry to oversee material purchases for various routes, there have been no delays in payments. The credibility of these newly issued material purchase promissory notes is inherently high. However, as this type of promissory note is a first in our country, there are concerns that the public may not fully understand its nature. Therefore, an agreement was reached with a syndicate comprised of the Central Trust Bureau and four banks, including Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Zhejiang Xingxian, and Zhongnan, to guarantee payments and handle discounting, further solidifying their credibility. The material purchase promissory notes have a term of one year with a weekly interest rate of seven per mille. The Railway Ministry began issuing them on December 1st of last year, spread over twelve months. Although only half a year has passed, their effectiveness has gradually spread, and domestic material merchants are generally happy to accept them, hence their widespread promotion. This is because syndicate banks handle discounting and rediscounting at any time, making capital utilization flexible. Material suppliers can sell more materials, and even though the payment is not in cash, they can still discount the notes at the syndicate banks before maturity.

### Zhu Qing Tang Sues Wang Yuan Qi to Confirm Grain Quota Dispute

Zhu Qingtang, a 40-year-old local resident of Zhangjiazhai Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai, sued Wang Yuanqi (age 20), who lives in the same area, in the local court to confirm the grain quota. The suit stated that Zhu Heqing, the ancestor of Zhu Qingtang, purchased two mu, seven fen, and three hao of land in the An Guo Temple from the deceased abbot Yifan monk in April of the eighth year of the Republic of China, located at No. 307, Bao Zi Xu, 19th Tu, 28th Bao, Shanghai. An official deed exists as proof. At the time, the grain quota for the aforementioned land was assessed according to the People's Association ancestor Zhu Suishan, with no objections. However, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, Wang Yuanqi secretly collected the grain quota for the above property, which was assessed under the name Zhu Yuanshan, in an attempt to infringe upon the property rights. After being discovered by the people, they petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau to correct the situation. Subsequently, because the dispute should be resolved judicially, it is requested that the situation be confirmed, etc. Yesterday, Judge Chen Pin held a court session. The defendant, represented by lawyer Huang Jiyuan, argued that the grain quota application was purchased from Shen Zhaonan in the 21st year of the Republic of China and that a transfer certificate was registered and issued by the Land Bureau. Both parties own a piece of land and there is no dispute. However, since the plaintiff cannot produce evidence, the defendant has the right to pay taxes. The plaintiff should apply to the Land Bureau for payment, not seek confirmation from the defendant, which indicates ulterior motives, etc. The court decided to write to the Land Bureau for investigation before a further hearing.

The land certificate was given to Zhangfa, and Zhangfa paid the stepmother and younger siblings 20 yuan per month for living expenses. However, since this year, Zhangfa has been unwilling to bear the cost, so Xia and her biological children and the daughter from the previous wife, Jinmei, petitioned the local court to divide the real estate into seven shares. Yesterday morning, Judge Pang held a court session. Zhangfa argued that the house has always been rented out by the plaintiff, and the house and land had long been mortgaged by his late father. The mother and son living together is to save expenses. The predecessors' business creation was difficult and should not be dispersed. The plaintiff is young and the younger siblings are young. Once divided, they will inevitably suffer in the future. The court discussed the matter and adjourned the hearing to investigate further.

### Six Arrested for Gambling Den on Bazi Road Awaiting Sentencing

West Detective Ma Ya of the Hongkou Police Station recently learned that within the Philippine Club at No. 279 and No. 287 Bazi Road, an international gambling organization was being run. Gamblers from China, England, America, Japan, and other countries were participating in gambling day and night. He reported this to the Special Court No. 1, who issued a search warrant. He, along with personnel from the Japanese Consulate, secretly went to the address around 11 p.m. the night before and arrested more than seventy gamblers. Among them, apart from fifty-three Japanese and British and American nationals with consular jurisdiction who were transferred to their respective consulates for trial, there were also six people: Lin Yinan from Fujian, Guo Jiawang, Turkish national Ranma Erju Shafi, Westerner without consular jurisdiction Francisco Bapotee Sta, Brit not recognised by English consulate Choi Ersi Lokheite, and Russian Fanlai Lotelelin. Along with their gambling equipment and money, they were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 5 of the Special Court No. 1. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for gambling under Article 266 of the Criminal Law and described the details of the bust. After Judge Meng Tingke questioned the six defendants one by one, he ordered them to be held for sentencing next Friday. The request to be released on bail was approved.

### Shops Along Suzhou Creek Suffer from Excessive Fines

Reasons for Slow Unloading Please Handle with Police Consideration

The area along Suzhou Road, both north and south of the Public Concession, is a major hub for water and land transportation, with a high concentration of inland river vessels. The loading and unloading of passengers and goods is extremely frequent. According to the police regulations, goods cannot be left unattended during loading and unloading; otherwise, fines will be imposed. However, the area has many ironworks, banks, and warehouses, and the goods are heavy. Accidental delays are often met with harsh fines. Sometimes, a single business is fined seven or eight times within a month, causing significant distress. Therefore, the Da Jiangnan and Yuantong shipping companies, Jin Yi, Yi Da, Yuan Zhuang, Ming Xing ironworks, and Gong Mao salt warehouses, totaling more than fifty businesses, jointly sent a letter to the Fifteenth District Civic Association to negotiate. It is learned that the association has forwarded a letter to the Hongkou and Lao Zha police stations requesting lenient handling to ease the burden on businesses.

### Zhu Xueshi Still Absent in Fraud Case

Court Will Issue Arrest Warrant

Zhu Xueshi, also known as lawyer Zhu Shuzhi, has been practicing law in Shanghai for many years. Four years ago, he had a relationship with a woman from Suzhou named Chen Xiaomei and lived with her in the West Lake Lane on Ximen Road for four years. Recently, Chen discovered that Zhu had wives and concubines in both Jiading and Hangzhou, leading to disagreements. On January 25 of this year, both parties agreed to end the relationship. Zhu paid Chen Xiaomei 100 yuan in cash and a bank check for 200 yuan dated February 25 as settlement. Unexpectedly, when the check matured, it bounced due to insufficient funds. Chen approached Zhu to negotiate, but Zhu avoided her. Chen Xiaomei, unable to bear it any longer, hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against Zhu Xueshi in the Criminal Division of the Special Court No. 2, accusing him of fraud. After several hearings were scheduled, they were repeatedly postponed due to the defendant's absence. This situation has been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday, another hearing was scheduled, but Zhu was still not present. Only the plaintiff's lawyer appeared in court. The court decided that due to the defendant's absence, the trial could not proceed and was temporarily suspended until the defendant is arrested and brought before the court.

### Coppersmith Sentenced to Four Years for Homicide

Shen Rencai, a 17-year-old apprentice from Haimen at Huang Yuanji Copper Shop, No. 9 Jin Tong Village, Daju Bridge, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, argued with another apprentice, Yu Longcai, while working on the evening of the 25th of last month. Gu Linqi (22, from Haimen), a coppersmith at the shop, stopped them, but they did not listen. Gu then slapped Shen on the right cheek near the ear, causing a blood vessel to rupture and his whole body to go numb. He was sent to the hospital, but died before receiving treatment. Huang Weiqi, the owner of the shop, reported the incident to the police, who verified the death after an examination by an official from the Special Court No. 2 and arranged for burial. The police arrested the assailant, Gu Linqi, and sent him to the Special Court No. 2. The police department lawyer prosecuted him for causing death by injury, as reported in this newspaper. Judge Chen Shuoying concluded the investigation and sentenced Gu Linqi to four years of imprisonment for causing death by injury at 10 a.m. yesterday.

### Chinese Police Officer Accused of Abduction and Rape Awaits Sentencing

Li Juduo, a Chinese police officer No. 686 of the French Concession Police, was accused of abducting and raping Dai Genlin, the 16-year-old daughter of Dai Xiaodi, who lives at No. 49 Tong Kangli, across from the Slaughterhouse. On October 30, he incited the girl to run away and hide at No. 5 of the Manufacturing Bureau Road, South Shanghai, with the intention of cohabitating with her. The girl's father found a photo of Li in his police uniform in the girl's suitcase and reported it to the French Concession Police, who dismissed and detained Li and sent Dai to her father. The Special Court No. 2 interrogated them and Li was detained for investigation, while the girl was handed over to her father, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying held a continued trial in Criminal Court No. 1. The police department lawyer prosecuted him for offenses against family and morality. The plaintiff, Dai Xiaodi, and his mother testified. The hearing was closed to the public due to the nature of the case. Both Li and Dai denied any physical relationship. They admitted to opening a room after they met. The court debate concluded, and sentencing was set for the 11th. The defendant was returned to custody, and the girl was sent for a medical examination for further verification.

### Wu Longhe's Lawsuit for Division of Property, Cost Relief Issue

Plaintiff and Defendant Hold Contradictory Views Court Ordered to Submit Proof

After the death of Li Bohang, the Qing Dynasty's envoy to England, his eldest daughter (i.e., the wife of Yang Yunshi) and her children Yang Cheng, Yang Yin, etc., demanded a division of inheritance from Li Bohang's children Li Guotao, etc., and litigated in the Special Court No. 1. As a result, the Yangs were declared the victors. Now, Wu Longhe, the adopted son of Wu Yuchang, the third daughter of Bohang, has also filed a lawsuit in the Special Court No. 1 against Li Guotao, Li Guojie, Li Guohua, Li Guoyun (Bohang's children), Li Jiaxiang (the adopted son of Bohang's second son), Pan Yaorong (the son born to Bohang's second daughter), and the Yang Cheng brothers, totaling twelve people, seeking to inherit on behalf of his mother. Because he was unable to pay the litigation costs, he found Yugang Hardware in Suzhou Road to guarantee his application for litigation assistance. All of these details have been reported in this newspaper on the 23rd of last month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo Can held a hearing in Civil Court No. 4. Because Yugang Hardware could only prove that Wu Longhe had been unemployed for a long time, but could not prove whether he actually had no property and whether he was unable to pay the litigation costs, an investigation was ordered. Therefore, only this point was questioned. According to Wu Longhe's testimony, he has been unemployed for a long time and has difficulty making a living, so he is unable to pay the litigation costs for this case. However, the defendant's lawyer, He Shimei, claimed that investigations revealed that the plaintiff has ancestral property in his ancestral home in Anhui and two properties in Nanjing, one given to his daughter by Li Bohang and one that is the plaintiff's ancestral property. The plaintiff was still employed by the Wuxi County Government in the spring of last year. Although he is now unemployed, it has not been long, so he is fully capable of paying the litigation costs. Wu replied that although there is some meager property in his ancestral home in Anhui, it is a shared ancestral property and cannot be divided. The house in Nanjing that Li Bohang gave to his late mother was sold to others several years ago for 10,000 yuan because he lost his parents early. The other property in Nanjing is also jointly owned. Therefore, the defendant's claims cannot be established. After examining the information, the court adjourned the hearing to allow the parties to submit proof.

Casual Talk

### Strange Things

— Zhou Ge

This world is really changing! Some time ago, there was news of "mice" eating "cats." Isn't this a "strange thing"? The discovery of "strange things" makes old people with feudal minds think the world is changing!

Following this kind of strange thing, now there are bees and crows fighting in the sky, and the result is: the bees won the final victory!

It turns out that to the east of Xuzhou, near the Yunhe Station along the Longhai Railway, in the Zhaobazhuang area, there is a tree with many crow nests on top. A few days ago, a large group of bees suddenly flew over, occupying the branches and buzzing noisily. The crows were annoyed by the noise, so they pecked at the bees with their beaks. Unexpectedly, the bees were furious and resisted as a group. So the crows and bees fought in the sky! After fighting for a long time, a large number of bees died, and more than a dozen crows were blinded by the bees' stingers, and another seven or eight fell to the ground and died. The entire bee colony mobilized and came to join the battle, densely covering the sky, fighting continuously for several days. Because the number of bees was large, the crows were heavily surrounded, and as a result, the bees won a great victory!

After reading the above, I feel that this doesn't seem like a "true event, but more like a fairy tale we read when we were young." But this is an absolutely true "fact"! A few years ago, in the Hailar area of northwestern China, a large number of rats suddenly rushed in. Wherever they went, the fields were trampled bare. Cattle, sheep, and even small children were bitten to death or injured! These things that people consider "strange things" are all "facts"!

According to common sense, if a bee is compared to a crow, the bee is indeed much smaller than the crow! And compared to cats, or to small children, sheep, cattle, etc., everyone would say that these little rats are insignificant! However, these little things are now "showing off"! Surprisingly, bees can defeat crows, and rats, which have always been eaten by cats, are now eating cats instead. This is not a small matter, but even sheep, cattle, and people are bitten and injured or bitten to death!

Do you think this is a "strange thing"? In fact, upon closer inspection, it is not a strange thing at all! When bees are compared individually to crows, or rats to cats, sheep, cattle, people, etc., of course bees are inferior to crows, and rats are inferior to cats, sheep, cattle, people, etc.! But if they are compared as a group, then there are many bees, so the crows have to lose! There are many rats, so the cats have to be eaten, and cattle, sheep, people, etc., can only be bitten and injured or bitten to death! Of course, "many" is not the true essence of "victory." It is necessary for "many" to feel the necessity of their own "survival," and when they sense that their survival is being threatened, they make a heroic counterattack. This is the true essence of victory!

The so-called "strange things" are nothing more than "ordinary" things like this!

### Anti-Chinese Incident

— Lin Na

Reportage

Last summer, I set off from Manila to Sanbilon.

On the way, I met a coconut buyer. He recognized that I was Chinese, so he waved to me and greeted me: "Our people, going to Sanbilon? Be careful, there is an anti-Chinese trend going on there..."

Just as I wanted to ask him for more details, his truck sped past, leaving only a large tail of dust. "Can I trust what this merchant said?" I asked myself doubtfully, while still urging the driver to go as fast as possible.

In the afternoon, we arrived at a small town. A grain buyer heard that I was coming from Manila for the first time, so he warned me and offered to let me stay. It was only five miles from here to Sanbilon. After the anti-Chinese incident in Sanbilon, this place was also affected. The young locals abandoned their previous harmony with the Chinese. In groups of three or five, they waved machetes, wooden sticks, and stones, and attacked Chinese shops. The Chinese shops did not back down either. Similar incidents that had emerged endlessly over the decades had taught them how to deal with them.

A small street was crowded with fifty or sixty shops. Except for two or three Japanese and local shops, all were closed. On the quiet street, fierce young locals lazily strolled past. They shouted madly, wantonly using all kinds of insults to verbally abuse the Chinese, provoking their anger to come out of the shops. Then, someone would attack first, followed by semi-armed ambushers squeezing out from around the corners of the buildings. On the Chinese side, there was also a secret agreement that if one person suffered misfortune, everyone would come out to rescue them. Therefore, there were often more than half the number of attackers emerging from the shops, wielding wooden sticks, kitchen knives, and other weapons to fight back.

When I came out of the bathroom after washing up, a young shop assistant from a neighboring shop came over and told me the "real reason" for what was happening.

A young Chinese man fell in love with the daughter of a local. He legally obtained her consent and asked her father for her hand in marriage, but was rejected. Therefore, he lured her out of her thatched hut and eloped, building their small family in Sanbilon.

The old man who lost his daughter was very sad. He went to the "guan ding" (i.e., the village's public security agency) to report it, but the young Chinese man silenced him with money. Having no other choice, he went out to investigate the address of the criminal couple. Soon it was found out, and the old man called his eldest son over:

——Go, put an end to that traitor!

He took a *bolo* knife himself and handed him another one.

They came down from the mountaintop and found this happy young couple on the upper floor of a shop in Sanbilon. The criminal couple was terrified and fell to their feet, tears overflowing from their eyes, begging for forgiveness. But they didn't say a word, silently took out their knives, and each of them ended their lives. In their anger, they also slaughtered the men and women in the shop. The Chinese throughout the street were shocked and came to retaliate, and a great massacre occurred.

I listened quietly, and in order to further understand the process of this incident and the opinions of the Chinese, I decided to make a visit. That night, under the guard of a group of armed young shop assistants, I set off.

We were very calm and did not suffer any attacks. The locals had withdrawn from the street. Because of the sudden arrival of this stranger, they dared not take any new actions before they had investigated the situation clearly. I was being promoted as an official.

An old man who had come here to do business at the age of thirteen told us:

"I've lived here for at least forty-five years, and I've seen all kinds of things, but I've never seen anything as barbaric as this time. You think, in Sanbilon, twenty of us were killed, and here a woman was dragged out and humiliated naked. What was it for? A woman, a love affair. I'm old, I really can't stand such a world..."

As he spoke, he gently stroked his silver-white beard, revealing a desolate appearance.

"Let's go listen to the testimony of the humiliated woman," I thought, and bid farewell and left.

### Speaking of Sports Meets

— Qi Feng

The Ninth Municipal Joint Elementary School Sports Meet opened on the 6th in the city center. I recalled my childhood.

My alma mater in my childhood was famous for sports. Every time the elementary school sports meet ended, it always brought back many silver shields and banners. For a time, firecrackers were set off, and the whole school rejoiced. The athletes were even more high-spirited and pleased with themselves. Even the teachers smiled more vigorously at them.

However, just because a school is in the limelight at the sports meet doesn't necessarily mean that every student in the school is strong and healthy. Those who are in the limelight at the sports meet are only a few so-called strong athletes in the school. Other students, except for occasionally going to the playground for gymnastics or kicking a small rubber ball, rarely appeared on the playground anymore. It was even more impossible for them to run around the venue and compete for points.

For example, I was one of them. In my childhood, my relationship with the sports meet couldn't be said to be shallow. Every time the sports meet was held, I was always at the venue, but I was only at the venue. Besides standing in the designated place to cheer for my alma mater's heroes, I rarely even had the chance to be selected for group exercises. Otherwise, I would bring some pocket money to buy some snacks to fill my stomach. Sometimes the weather was bad, and it suddenly rained. Then, I had to be a drenched chicken. (The venue at that time was always the Public Sports Ground on Daji Road, and its facilities were much simpler than the sports ground in the city center. For example, there was no place to hide from the rain.)

However, although there were often opportunities to be a drenched chicken, the sports meet was still a must-go: first, it was the teacher's order, and I dared not disobey; second, it was the child's desire for excitement, and there was also an excuse to ask for more money from home to buy more snacks; third, it was the hero-worshiping mentality at play, and this hero happened to be my classmate (although the athletes, when they returned in triumph, had their noses in the air and wouldn't pay attention to the young classmates). So I cheered even more vigorously. The reason for this vigor, of course, also had a despicable thought: if my classmate won the championship, it was as if I could also be proud to other schools.

Speaking of the athletes, when they returned in triumph, their arrogance was really unparalleled. It was fine if they ignored you; you could find classmates with common interests to play with. But if you happened to meet them on the playground, you would suffer even more: if you were doing the high jump, they would raise the bar to make you unable to jump over it, and they would laugh contemptuously at you; if you were kicking a ball, they would come over and snatch it, or tease you with the ball. Anyway, they kicked the ball better than you. Although they also had to lower their heads to ask you for help when it came to the big exams, that was another matter.

Although I have been away from school life for several years, and I haven't been to a sports meet for a long time, I wonder if the elementary school joint sports meet is still the same as when I was young?

So I only read the newspaper, and the newspaper has programs and results, as well as tidbits about the venue situation. One of them says: "At lunchtime, the athletes of each team either bring their own dry food or contract for catered meals. Just as they were wolfing down their food, the weather suddenly turned bad, and a heavy rain poured down. The little friends had already become drenched chickens, hating the sky and complaining to the earth. They had to hold bread in their left hands and clothes in their right hands, and in a hurry, stumbled and staggered, and hid under the stage. At the same time, a female student from Wan Zhu fell from a high place because the ground was slippery, and for a moment she couldn't breathe..."

So I know that in terms of order, the elementary school joint sports meet is still almost the same as before. And in terms of programs, although the chairman said, "On the one hand, we held group exercises at the opening ceremony to show that the sports meet is not just a few athletes performing skills, but to make all elementary school students pay attention to physical exercise. This is the true meaning of promoting sports!" However, in reality, individual skills are more noticeable and valued than group exercises, which is still almost the same as before. Therefore, it is not surprising that those who are heartbroken and shed tears because of "weight disqualification."

### Sai Jinhua

— Chen Hezhi

Sixteen

Sai Jinhua had really reached the end of her road. How did she still have the courage to move forward on such a long journey? And even if she had the courage to move forward, without anything to eat, wouldn't she starve to death on the road? Just at this time, she encountered a team of Qing soldiers. More unexpectedly, they were very gentle. Seeing that Sai Jinhua was a weak woman, they comforted her with great care and pointed out the road to Beijing.
