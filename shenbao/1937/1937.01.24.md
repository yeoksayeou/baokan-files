### The Central Government Still Hopes for Yang's Awakening

Still Maintaining a Lenient Stance Towards the Shaanxi Situation / Yang's Continued Delaying Will Only Hasten His Downfall / Li Zhigang Will Return to Nanjing Soon and Then Back to Shaanxi

[Nanjing] News from Luoyang on the 23rd stated that Yang Hucheng and others had agreed to withdraw their troops to the Tongguan-Yinan central area of northern Wei River, and to move the Pacification Headquarters to Sanyuan, seemingly indicating remorse. Someone visited He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, at 6 PM to inquire about the veracity of this news. He was not at his residence at the time, but his aides claimed that He had not received any official or private military reports regarding this matter today, and that the aforementioned news was definitely unreliable. The Central Government still maintains a lenient stance towards the Shaanxi situation, awaiting Yang Hucheng's awakening. Further news indicates that while the Central Government has not abandoned its lenient stance towards the Shaanxi situation, it has limitations. If Yang Hucheng can thoroughly awaken within the next few days, his past actions may be forgiven. However, if he continues to delay as a stalling tactic, he will only hasten his own downfall.

### Wang Speaks on Democratic Politics

[Nanjing] At 4 PM on the 21st, the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan held a tea party at the International Fellowship Society to welcome Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee. Vice President Kong Yongzhi gave a speech first, mainly recounting the efforts made by colleagues from various ministries and commissions together with Wang over the past 21 years, and expressing his joy at his return to Nanjing. He said that because Wang had to abstain from certain foods after his illness, he had only prepared light tea to express his respect. Then, Wang stood up to express his gratitude and briefly recounted his recovery. He also mentioned that Chairman Chiang had concurrently served as the head of the Executive Yuan for the past year, and that colleagues from various ministries and commissions had worked diligently to improve the country, and that there had been significant progress in national defense construction, finance, and diplomacy, which he greatly admired. The general content has already been seen in various newspapers and will not be repeated here. However, a section on democratic politics was not included in the newspapers. Wang personally wrote it down, and it is now published as follows:

"Just now, Mr. Kong asked me to talk about my feelings during my months in Europe. I am truly ashamed, feeling that I have not made any contributions, because I have been in a sanatorium for several months, and have had very little contact with people from all walks of life in Europe, so my knowledge is not broad. If I had to say something, after the European War, many monarchical autocratic countries were overthrown, and democratic polities were built, all based on the democratic theories since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At that time, the general public observed that democratic politics would flourish from then on, and that democratic politics would be the ultimate in politics. Unexpectedly, the proletarian dictatorship of the Soviet Union suddenly appeared, and then Italian fascism and German National Socialism successively emerged. These two kinds of politics have different contents and forms, and their merits and demerits are not to be discussed for the time being, but no one can deny that they are opposed to democratic politics. Therefore, the general public had another feeling, thinking that democratic politics would decline in this pincer-like situation. However, aren't England and France still democratic politics? Isn't the United States still democratic politics? The Republic of China is a democratic country, and the Chinese Kuomintang is the practitioner of the Three Principles of the People. Over the years, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly said that China is not suitable for autocratic politics. China is now and will continue to move towards the road of democratic politics, which is undoubtedly true. Opponents of democratic politics list the biggest shortcomings of democratic politics, which are nothing more than the prevalence of electoral malpractice, the unreliability of decision-making, and the slow action and low efficiency of the administrative system due to the constraints of other agencies, leading to weakness, etc. In fact, the Prime Minister had already seen these shortcomings in the Three Principles of the People and had already corrected them. We are convinced that the Three Principles of the People is a principle that is most suitable for democratic politics, and it is by no means comparable to those who casually imitate the democratic political theories since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. If democratic politics is promoted according to the Three Principles of the People, there will never be the various malpractices mentioned above. Even in the democratic politics of England, France, and the United States, although they give the people more political freedom in peacetime, the ability of the government to take measures is sometimes inevitably a little weak. However, once the country has a major change, the concentration of government power and the agility of action can be fully exerted without fear of constraints. This phenomenon was already significant during the European War. Not only should this be the case when the country is in crisis during the European War, but also in recent years, the United States has granted great power to President Roosevelt due to the economic panic, allowing him to exercise freedom. The United States is the most powerful country in the world today, and it is still the case in the face of a small crisis, let alone China, which is still in a period of adjustment and is plagued by both internal and external troubles. If there is a good government, the people trust it, allowing it to do its best to complete the plan and steps for saving the nation, which is very natural. There is also another layer. The more political freedom is given to the people in peacetime, the easier it is to cope with major changes, because the country is formed by the gathering of the people, and the political ability of the people is strong, then the strength of the country is also strengthened. It is like an army. If the soldiers are well-trained and capable on weekdays, then once something happens and they are mobilized, this army will definitely be the most brave and disciplined army. World political theories have questions about the limits of the powers of the organs, but there is no doubt about cultivating the political ability of the people. For example, in the recent Xi'an Incident, although the central government handled it properly and Mr. Chiang's sincerity was touching, the expression of national public opinion and people's will was extremely consistent and extremely serious, which was a powerful support. From this, we can see that cultivating the political ability of the people is an important principle in saving the nation. I hope that those who criticize democratic governance will not neglect this point. As for the concentration and unification of government power in order to cope with national disasters, there is no contradiction with cultivating the political ability of the people, because it is in the nature of the government and the people to depend on each other in coping with national disasters. The government is loyal to the people, and the people trust their government, which is its activity. Without the people as a foundation, neither democratic politics nor dictatorial politics can be established. For example, the Soviet Union has the proletariat as its foundation, and Italy and Germany have the majority of their working people as their foundation. These people, on the one hand, hate the violence of big capitalists, and on the other hand, hate the chaos of the Communist Party, so they sincerely support the government in order to seek rejuvenation. England, the United States, and France, etc., have various parties and factions, each representing the interests of a part of the people, and they coexist in a certain political way. Although their forms are different, they all have the same foundation of the people. Today, China is in the midst of internal and external troubles, and only by taking the common interests of the entire country and the entire nation as the basis to seek unity can it stand firm on a strong foundation. From this strong foundation, we can build a strong organ, that is, the government, to respond to national disasters. This is precisely the road to the Three Principles of the People set by the Prime Minister. Saving the nation depends on this. I respectfully raise this glass to wish Chairman Chiang good health, and good health to the heads of the various ministries and commissions and their colleagues." (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Guangzhou Representatives Hold Meeting to Relieve Rice Shortage

Decided to Form a Committee to Relieve Food Shortage / Kong Orders Purchase and Transportation of Wuhu Rice to Guangdong

[Hong Kong] After Guangdong halved the tax on imported rice, it was still impossible to transport it into the country due to the high price of imported goods, which did not help the market. The provincial and municipal party headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life on the 23rd to hold a meeting to relieve the rice shortage. They decided to form a committee to relieve the food shortage and telegraphed Nanjing to request a complete exemption from the imported rice tax. (23rd Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Minister of Finance Kong attaches great importance to the Guangdong rice shortage. In addition to drafting three relief measures, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation, he has also ordered the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau to order the Wuhu agent to purchase Wuhu rice and transport it to Guangdong for emergency relief. It is now known that Zheng Baozhao, the director of the bureau, has been ordered to discuss with Chen Zhongsheng, the manager of the savings department of the Central Trust Bureau, to go to Wuhu to purchase rice in large quantities. The Food Transportation and Sales Bureau has also contacted the transportation agencies to transport the Wuhu rice to Guangdong for a continuous supply of relief. The funds for purchasing the Wuhu rice and the transportation costs are all paid by the Central Trust Bureau. After the Wuhu rice is transported to Guangdong using the exchange settlement method, it will be reimbursed by the Guangdong People's Food Regulation Committee. It is said that this method of purchasing and transporting Wuhu rice to Guangdong can not only completely solve the Guangdong rice shortage, but also prevent the domestic rice market from being affected by the domestic sales of 300,000 metric tons of imported rice in Guangdong Province, which has a half-tax record.

WEEKLY FORUM

### From the Chinese Philosophical Association to the Usefulness of Philosophy

— Feng Youlan

The Chinese Philosophical Association is holding its third annual meeting in the capital from today to the 26th. This association is a national organization formed by people in China who study philosophy. It has three branches in Beiping, Nanjing, and Guangzhou. It publishes the quarterly journal "Philosophical Review," which has now reached Volume 7, Issue 2, and is published by Shanghai Kaiming Bookstore. Today, on the occasion of the Philosophical Association's meeting, I would like to say a few words about the usefulness of philosophy to arouse everyone's interest in and attention to philosophy.

What I want to talk about now is the usefulness of philosophy in political and social aspects, because these uses are direct and obvious. Throughout the country, from the authorities to young students, everyone likes this kind of usefulness. As for philosophy, like other disciplines, it also has some useless uses: I will not talk about them for the time being.

When the Chinese Philosophical Association held its first annual meeting in Beiping in April of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1935], a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao asked me to write down some thoughts. In that short article, I said: "The world we live in now, on the surface, seems to pay little attention to philosophy, but in essence, our world attaches great importance to philosophy. Throughout the world, in most countries, there are philosophies that they promote and prohibit. From this point, we can see how people now feel the power of philosophy. Every political and social system needs a theoretical basis. Only with a theoretical basis can that political and social organization be 'justified in name.' Looking at history, every society has its ideological 'Taizu Gao Emperor.' For example, Confucius after the Qin and Han dynasties in China, Jesus in the European Middle Ages, and Rousseau in modern times are all the theoretical backbones of a social system, the ideological 'Taizu Gao Emperor' in a society. Now, it is not only a world where nations compete for survival, but also a world where various social systems compete for survival, so everyone feels the importance of the theoretical basis of social systems." Two years have passed, and the situation I described remains unchanged. Many countries in the world want to establish a philosophy as the "orthodox tradition" to "rectify people's hearts, suppress heresies, reject perversions, and ban obscene words." We are in that kind of society, we are in that kind of "orthodox tradition," but we have long been unaware of its existence, just like breathing air.

Speaking of this, the usefulness of philosophy is a bit too great. Let me talk about some small uses of philosophy.

Recently, some people have said that philosophy is not about seeking truth. What philosophy does is to analyze the meaning of propositions in science or common sense clearly. Leaving aside whether this statement can encompass the entirety of philosophy, we can say that at least this is one of the uses of a part of philosophy. Now, in politics and society, there are many problems that everyone is arguing about and many slogans that everyone is shouting. If we use logic to analyze these problems or slogans, some problems will no longer be problems, and some slogans will no longer be slogans.

For example, recently there has been a slogan of "Striving for Freedom to Save the Nation." The term "Freedom to Save the Nation" is really very ambiguous. It has at least three meanings. The first is that one is willing to save the nation, that is, to save the nation, and the work of saving the nation is not restricted. The second is that one is willing to save the nation in any way, that is, to save the nation, and the method of saving the nation is not restricted. The third is that one is willing to save the nation, that is, to save the nation, and one is willing not to save the nation or unwilling to save the nation, and personal behavior is not coerced. According to the first meaning, freedom to save the nation is definitely possible. According to the third meaning, freedom to save the nation is definitely not possible. According to the second meaning, freedom to save the nation can be possible or impossible: it can be possible if the many methods used are not conflicting; it cannot be possible if the many methods used are conflicting. What kind of freedom to save the nation are those who strive for freedom to save the nation striving for; what kind of freedom to save the nation are those who restrict freedom to save the nation restricting; if this is made clear, many unnecessary disputes can be avoided.

For example, recently some people have said that studying cannot save the nation, because many people have studied for many years, but the country is still in trouble. Those who say this are actually due to not understanding the difference between what is called necessary and sufficient in ordinary logic. The success of a thing depends on many conditions. Some conditions are necessary but not sufficient. Some conditions are sufficient but not necessary. Some conditions are necessary and sufficient. Necessary but not sufficient conditions are "having it does not necessarily follow, but not having it necessarily does not follow." For example, if a person only eats, it does not necessarily mean that they can live, but if they do not eat, they definitely cannot live. Sufficient but not necessary conditions are "having it necessarily follows, but not having it does not necessarily not follow." For example, a person who gets typhoid fever necessarily has a fever, but a person who does not get typhoid fever does not necessarily not have a fever; if they get malaria, they can still have a fever. Sufficient and necessary conditions are "having it necessarily follows, and not having it necessarily does not follow." For example, if a person's heart stops beating, then the person dies. Sufficient and necessary conditions only exist for the simplest things. If saving the nation is such a complicated matter, its success depends on countless conditions: each condition is necessary but not sufficient. Having it does not necessarily save the nation, but not having it necessarily cannot save the nation. The relationship between studying and saving the nation is such a relationship. Training soldiers, building roads, training the masses, and so on, are all such relationships for saving the nation. To say that relying only on studying cannot save the nation, so studying is unnecessary, is like saying that relying only on eating cannot keep a person alive, so one should not eat. People now mostly want to do one thing, relying only on this one thing to save the nation. This kind of thing not only does not exist now, but also will not exist in the future, and even more so will not exist. Because the more society evolves, the more detailed the division of labor becomes, and every thing is necessary but not sufficient for society. This is certainly common sense, but when speaking in terms of logic, it becomes even clearer.

For example, the recent debates about the so-called cultural issues can also be resolved with logic. There is a term "Chinese-centric culture"; this term itself can have two meanings. The first meaning is culture that is centered on China. The second meaning is culture that is centered on China's existing culture. According to the first meaning, it can be said that no one disagrees with Chinese-centric culture. All those who advocate building a new Chinese culture, no matter which faction, do not regard themselves as being in the interest of China, that is, none of them do not regard themselves as being centered on China. If according to the second meaning, then there is controversy. There are those who advocate so-called complete Westernization and those who advocate so-called partial Westernization, and they argue with it. In fact, if these disputes are viewed from the perspective of logic, most of them are easily resolved. In logic, there is a distinction between the individual and the type. An individual can represent many types. For example, Confucius can represent many types, such as a person from the Spring and Autumn period, a person from Shandong, a person who lived past the age of seventy, a sage, and so on. The individual learns from that individual, but what is actually learned is a certain type, or several types, that it represents. For example, some people want to learn from Confucius, but what they really want to learn is the type of sage that he represents. The individual cannot be learned. The so-called West is an individual, and in terms of culture, it represents many types, such as Christian culture, scientific culture, industrial culture, etc. When we say learn from the West, what we are really learning is a certain cultural type or several cultural types that it represents, such as scientific culture or industrial culture. As for those aspects of China's original culture that do not conflict with this, of course they will not be changed. For example, Zhu Xi learned from Confucius, but Zhu Xi was not from Shandong, but not being from Shandong does not conflict with being a sage, and Zhu Xi does not need to change to being from Shandong. From this point of view, some of the above-mentioned disputes about culture are resolved without the need for dispute.

The small usefulness of philosophy, although not enough to "rectify people's hearts," can also "banish empty words." All debates that are not logical, or debates that have no meaning from a logical point of view, are obscene words. If there are no obscene words in politics and society, then unnecessary disputes can be reduced a lot.

### Severe Cold and Floods Spread Across Twelve States in the United States

190,000 People Homeless, Floodwaters Receding After Midnight

[New York] Airplanes, trains, ships, and trucks are fully loaded with food and clothing, rushing to disaster areas to relieve the tens of thousands of homeless refugees. Experts predict that it will take at least a week for the floodwaters to recede to normal levels. The floods have now affected twelve states, with approximately 190,000 people displaced in the disaster areas. The Red Cross is currently conducting a relief campaign and has raised $2 million in Washington. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)

Chicago Severe cold and blizzards are affecting Ohio and parts of the Mississippi Valley areas today, making the flood refugees all the more miserable. Fortunately, the flooding seems to have stopped rising, but the highwaters are still raging in the south and midwest. The Red Cross has asked the country to donate funds to help the victims. Four of the Pottsville Hospitals are now filled with patients suffering from colds and flu. The level of the River in Pittsburgh at 6:00 PM today was 32 feet, seven feet above flood level. The weather bureau predicts that it will rise to 32 feet 9 inches at midnight, and will gradually fall after that. 60,000 relief workers in the disaster area are working hard. (22nd Guomin News)

Cincinnati The Ohio River has risen to the height of the 1884 flood. Government meteorologists predicted today that the United States will have another record-breaking major flood. The Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and other rivers have flooded extensively, forcing 125,000 residents of twelve states to flee their homes. Many more are trapped by the water and have not been able to escape. The amount of property loss cannot yet be estimated. Telegraph, telephone, railway, and highway traffic in the disaster areas have all been blocked. Only very little news has been transmitted from the hundreds of submerged villages. The power supply to Cincinnati and Louisville, Kentucky, is in danger of being cut off at any time by the rising water. The authorities have strictly announced a curfew to prevent hoodlums from looting under cover of darkness. The Kentucky State Prison was flooded today, and although 2,900 prisoners are drawing water in shifts, prison officials say that it will likely become uninhabitable. Several large oil tanks in Aurora, Indiana, have been flooded, and tens of thousands of tons of gasoline are floating on the surface of the water, flowing throughout the town. A Red Cross official there managed to send a telephone message saying, "Two-thirds of the town is now submerged in water, and there is oil floating on the surface of the water, which could cause a fire. Food supplies are dwindling, and we have now implemented a system of rationing food and water." Near Cincinnati, a wooden house was drifting downstream with five people inside, frantically calling for help, but hundreds of onlookers on the shore were unable to help because the current was too swift. The Washington government has dispatched fifty coast guard patrol boats and a seaplane to assist in the rescue work. The most severely affected areas have implemented mobilization of naval reserves and national guards, and another 8,000 people have been ordered to carry out relief work. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)

### Severe Cold in California, USA, Causes Major Losses in Orange Production

Los Angeles The weather in southern California is severely cold, the lowest temperature in 30 years, causing great losses to local orange growers. Although the orange groves have artificial warming equipment, the orange harvest in May this year will be reduced by 15%, with losses reaching US$20 million. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)

### Roosevelt Does Not Interfere in Labor Disputes

Only Advising Labor and Management Not to Go to Extremes; Shipping Association Rejects Seamen's Conditions

[Washington] President Roosevelt, speaking to reporters at his routine meeting today, requested that both labor and management in the automobile industry not attack each other in the newspapers over the strike issue, and even more so not take publicly irreconcilable positions, so as to avoid both sides falling into a stalemate of unwillingness to give in for the sake of saving face. John L. Lewis, president of the Committee for Industrial Organization, denied today that he had requested the President to intervene, but said that President Roosevelt would take necessary measures. According to Lewis's words to reporters, the strike will be extended until the General Motors Corporation is forced to accept collective bargaining agreements. General Motors President Sloan, upon returning to New York from Washington, spoke with reporters, saying that there were many obstacles to a peaceful resolution. At the same time, it was officially announced that General Motors is currently working hard to find ways to resume work at the closed factories, so that "employees who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own" have the opportunity to work. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)

[San Francisco] The Shipping Association met today to discuss the conditions proposed by the workers for a long time. After the meeting, it was announced that the Shipping Association will reject the suggestions of the International Longshoremen's Association yesterday to resolve the labor dispute.

### League of Nations Administrative Council Discusses Raw Material Distribution Issue

Appoints a Fourteen-Nation Committee; Session to Commence After German and Italian Participation

[Geneva] The issues of Danzig, raw materials, and social welfare are all matters the League of Nations intends to deliberate on. This evening, the League of Nations Administrative Council will first hold a closed meeting, followed by an open meeting. Attending will be eight foreign ministers. The agenda includes various issues concerning the League of Nations' efforts to promote social well-being. Polish Foreign Minister Beck and British Foreign Secretary Eden met this morning to discuss the Danzig situation. Eden then attended a special committee on the Danzig issue, reporting the results of his discussions with Beck. It is widely believed that a compromise can be reached soon. Meanwhile, the question of whether to invite Germany and Italy to participate in the raw materials committee, which is expected to be established next week, is currently under the consideration of rapporteur Beck. Although no invitations have been issued to Germany and Italy yet, inquiries have been made to Germany regarding their willingness to participate. It is said that Germany intends to decline but will pay attention to the proceedings of the meeting. Italy has not yet expressed its position, but it may be nominated as a member of the committee, given that Italy remains a member state of the League of Nations, while Germany is not. (Reuters, 22nd)

[Geneva] Regarding the issue of re-distribution of raw materials proposed by Polish Foreign Minister Beck, the Administrative Council of the League of Nations has decided to appoint representatives from fourteen groups as committee members to form a committee on the issue of raw material distribution. It will convene under the guidance of the League of Nations soon, with its mission limited to purely theoretical research on the raw material issue to collect information for future economic conferences. This economic conference will only be convened when the general situation improves and when Germany and Italy can genuinely cooperate economically with the member states of the League of Nations. So far, only Brazil, the United States, and Canada have accepted the invitation to participate in the raw materials committee. Furthermore, most Latin American countries have a negative impression of international cooperation to solve the raw material problem. This is because most of the fourteen groups participating in the raw materials committee are either countries with colonies and mandated territories or countries that demand colonies. Therefore, Latin American countries fear that the committee's discussions will not be limited to purely economic issues but will involve political issues, which is not what the Latin American countries desire.

### Discord Between Japanese Army and Navy Leads to Collapse of Hirota Cabinet

In Power for Ten Months, Feeling Torn Between the Two Sides; Emperor Sends Envoy to Seek Opinion of Saionji

[Tokyo] The Cabinet held a meeting this afternoon and passed the final resolution for the Cabinet's resignation en masse, adjourning at 4:50 PM. Prime Minister Hirota entered the Imperial Palace at 5:00 PM, paid his respects to the Emperor, and presented the Cabinet's resignation letter en masse, which was immediately approved by the Emperor. (Central News Agency, 21st)

[Tokyo] The Hirota Cabinet, established only ten months ago, has resigned en masse this afternoon because it could not persuade Army Minister Terauchi to change his decision to dissolve the Diet. The Emperor has approved the resignation, but has ordered Hirota to remain in charge until a new Cabinet is formed. (Reuters, 23rd)

[Tokyo] Today's emergency cabinet meeting, convened on the issue of dissolving the Diet, resulted in internal disunity due to disagreements between the military and cabinet members from political parties. As a result, Prime Minister Hirota decided to submit his resignation en masse. After the resignation letters of the cabinet members were prepared, they were scheduled to enter the palace at 4:50 PM to submit the resignation letters. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] When Prime Minister Hirota presented his resignation letter, he also attached the reasons for his resignation. The gist of it is as follows: Having received the great honor of being appointed to office after the extraordinary incident, I have served until now despite my limited abilities and talents. However, considering the recent political situation, I find it very difficult to administer policies smoothly and fear that I will not be able to proceed smoothly. Therefore, I respectfully request to be relieved of my duties. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] The chief secretary, Tsunenuma, the director-general of the Legislative Bureau, Tsugita, and other parliamentary officials from various ministries have submitted their resignation letters due to the collective resignation of the Hirota Cabinet. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] Attendant General Hyakutake, receiving the Emperor's instructions, dispatched attendant officer Nitta Motoji with a letter to Okitsu to seek the opinion of Duke Saionji. He departed from Tokyo by train westward at 9:00 PM on the 23rd, stayed overnight in Shizuoka, and is scheduled to arrive in Okitsu at 8:00 AM on the 24th. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] Supervisor of Education Sugiyama, Vice Chief of the General Staff Nishio, Vice Minister of the Army Umezu, and Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Isotani, among others, gathered at the Army Minister's official residence at 6:00 PM on the 23rd to discuss the attitude to be taken towards the next cabinet. The Army Minister, upon returning from the cabinet meeting, immediately reported on the situation of the cabinet meeting and exchanged important opinions on future countermeasures. On the naval side, a dinner was held at the Naval Minister's official residence at 6:30 PM. Naval Minister Nagano, Vice Minister Yamamoto, Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff Shimada, Director of the Personnel Bureau Shimizu, and other senior officials attended and held important discussions on the current situation. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] The conflict between the Japanese Army and political parties first led to the cabinet's decision to dissolve the Diet, followed by a compromise movement, and finally, the cabinet's resignation en masse. This seems to be a logical sequence in Japanese politics. When the cabinet meeting decided on the principle of dissolving the Diet yesterday, there was still room for mediation, attempting to determine within the last 24 hours whether the political parties were completely determined to overthrow the cabinet. If the political parties had no such determination, they would request a compromise from the military. Therefore, Naval Minister Nagano began mediation last night. Since the political parties accepted the mediation, the crisis could naturally be averted. However, the military insisted on dissolving the Diet, stating that the political parties, with their liberal views, were hindering Japan's future and development by deliberating on national policies, and that there was no other way to make the political parties reflect except by dissolving the Diet. Conversely, the cabinet members did not want to dissolve the Diet from the beginning, especially since the political parties had now accepted the compromise terms, making the dissolution even more baseless. Before the emergency cabinet meeting, the debate over the opinions advocating and opposing the dissolution of the Diet was quite intense, so the cabinet meeting resulted in the decision to resign en masse. (Central News Agency, 23rd)

### Army's Strong Stance Leads to Failure of Naval Minister's Mediation

Army Authorities Hold Two Meetings, Decide to Move Forward with Established Policy

[Tokyo] Naval Minister Mizuno received formal responses from both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties on the 23rd, so he arranged to meet with Army Minister Terauchi. Recognizing the seriousness of the current situation, he intended to earnestly implore the Army Minister to move towards compromise and overcome the difficult situation. Since the Naval Minister consistently wanted to avoid dissolution, he was determined to ensure the passage of the budget and important bills. Therefore, this meeting, even if it could not establish a compromise, would see him fully express this belief at the cabinet meeting on the 23rd. If the Army did not respond in a cooperative manner, it would lead to disunity within the cabinet. Afterwards, either a further request would be made to suspend the meeting and engage in compromise efforts with the Army, or a resignation en masse would be decided upon, one of the two. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] The Army held a meeting of its leaders at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, attended by Vice Minister Umezu, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Kitani, Chief of the Military Affairs Section Ishimoto, and Chief of the Press Section Hata, among others. Focusing on the issue of Naval Minister Nagano's visit to the presidents of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, the results of the discussion on the attitude and policy the Army should adopt in the future reached the following conclusion: Although Naval Minister Nagano visited the presidents of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties for the sake of mediation, the Army did not receive any notification and was unaware of this. Therefore, the Army decided to adhere to its established policy and consistently advocate for dissolution. At the cabinet meeting on the 23rd, the Army Minister would strongly advocate for it again. If Naval Minister Mizuno insisted on avoiding dissolution, the Army Minister would have no choice but to resign alone. Although the political situation would be thrown into confusion as a result, the Army would naturally not bear the responsibility for it. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 AM. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] After holding a meeting of its leaders on the morning of the 23rd, the Army authorities held an emergency meeting of the three chiefs from 11:00 AM, attended by Army Minister Terauchi, Supervisor of Education Sugiyama, and Vice Chief of the General Staff Nishio. The Army Minister reported on the policy decided upon at the meeting of leaders, to exclude all compromises, to hope for the clarification of politics, and explained the internal situation. After discussion, the three agreed unanimously that the Army Minister would reject Naval Minister Nagano's compromise measures at the afternoon's emergency cabinet meeting and continue to move forward with the established policy. (Domei, 23rd)

### Japanese Army Issues Statement

Implement Active Policies

[Tokyo] Regarding this political upheaval, the Army issued a statement in the form of an official announcement, as follows: The reasons for the Army Minister's request for resignation have already been explained by the Army Minister. Now, I will state the Army's consistent aspirations. The grand policy of national defense and national policy that the Army aims for is to clarify the concept of national morality and implement active domestic and foreign policies. Since the end of the World War, there have been drastic changes in thought, and economic and international relations have also changed. However, the country's policies have not adapted to the reality, and the country is in dire straits, and the lives of the people are extremely oppressed. Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, Japan has become a stabilizing force in East Asia, seeking to guarantee peace and coexist and prosper with other countries, and to ensure the survival and development of the nation. Therefore, it is believed that the implementation of an active national military is even more necessary at this time. The problems of Japan's population and stabilizing the lives of the people can only be solved by implementing this grand national policy. If we are satisfied with the current situation, the country will decline day by day and fall into dire straits. This is self-evident. Therefore, to build a leaping Japan, it is necessary not only to implement the national defense plans that are being pursued, but also to realize policies that will renew all aspects of government in order to stabilize the lives of the people. This is the grand outline of Japan's national policy, which should be confirmed. To implement the realistic grand policy and the grand outline of national policy, it is even more urgent to exert Japan's unique constitutional spirit and implement fair and strong politics. However, observing the current state of the political world, it lacks an understanding of the current situation, engages only in party interests and party strategies, and has degenerated into a passive and conservative maintenance of the status quo, which is extremely regrettable. Under this current state of affairs, we should reject the compromising means of appeasement and resolutely carry out a fundamental cleansing of the political world in order to express the will of the people. This should be the key element in the center of the current political situation. (Domei, 23rd)

### Nagano's Statement

[Tokyo] Naval Minister Nagano said, "Now is a time of national emergency, and I deeply believe that the entire country should unite to deal with the situation and avoid domestic disputes. Because this year is the first year after the abolition of the naval treaty, I obtained the cooperation of Commerce Minister Ogawa to mediate the political dispute in my personal capacity, and met with Machida, Suzuki, Hatoyama, and others, and obtained their understanding. I plan to meet with Army Minister Terauchi today to express my beliefs and urge him to do his best for the country." (Domei, 23rd)

### The Hirota Cabinet Amidst Resignation Rumors

### Explosion at Japanese Army Ordnance Factory

Five Dead, Four Injured

[Tokyo] The Ministry of the Army announced that at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, a fire broke out at the Kyokyo smokeless powder manufacturing plant of the Army Ordnance Factory while workers were mixing smokeless powder. Five workers in the room died immediately, three were seriously injured, and one passerby was burned. Although some of the gunpowder being worked on was moved out, most of it was burned. The cause is under investigation. (Domei, 23rd)

### Prince Konoe Is the Most Popular Choice for New Prime Minister

Left-Wing Organizations Form a Restoration Party; Japanese Political Situation Becomes Increasingly Complex

[Tokyo] Whenever a political upheaval occurs, it has become customary for the Emperor to summon Saionji to Kyoto or send an attendant to inquire about his choice for the next prime minister. However, this time, the Army is strongly opposed to members of existing political parties entering the next cabinet and has preemptively advocated that the new cabinet dissolve the Diet. Therefore, resolving the situation will take some time. Even if Duke Saionji is ordered to make a recommendation, he will do so with extreme caution. Moreover, the Duke has recently been slightly unwell. Even if there is an imperial order, he may not be able to go to Kyoto. Considering all the circumstances, it is especially important to understand the intentions of the Army. Perhaps he will contact Grand Chamberlain Yuasa and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Matsumoto and other senior officials and ask the attendant to answer the imperial inquiry on his behalf. Currently, the leading candidates for prime minister include Prince Konoe Fumimaro, Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, General of the Army Ugaki Kazushige, and Admiral of the Navy Suetsugu Nobumasa. However, the Army hopes that Prince Konoe will take the lead. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] This morning, the editorials of various newspapers unanimously opposed dissolving the Diet, but some newspapers also opposed the cabinet's resignation and supported a compromise. Other newspapers believed that the cabinet's resignation was the only way to break the current deadlock. The final curtain has not yet been raised, and the movement to form a new party is already underway. Some support Konoe Fumimaro, and some support Ugaki Kazushige. It is said that both factions can gain some support from the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, but it is very difficult to gain the support of the majority. The Japanese political situation has reached an extremely complex stage. (Central News Agency, 23rd)

[Tokyo] The Current Affairs Consultative Council, in view of the pressing political situation, aims to promote the unity of national patriotic organizations and establish a large restoration party. It has decided to proceed with preparatory work. Discussions have been held since the night of the 22nd, and concrete results will be revealed within days. The groups currently participating include the New Japan Seamen's Union, the Japan National League, the Greater Japan Production Party, the Japan Federation of Labor Unions, the Greater Japan Youth Party, the National Association, and the Patriotic Labor-Farmer Comrades Association. (Domei, 23rd)

### Soviet Russian Party Trial Opens; Defendants Plead Guilty

Radek and Seventeen Other Key Figures to Be Executed for Endangering the Party and the Country

[Moscow] The Supreme Court's Military Tribunal held a public hearing again today, with seventeen former high-ranking Soviet Russian officials as defendants, including the famous writer Radek and former Ambassador to Britain Sokolnikov. If found guilty, they will be sentenced to death. The atmosphere was tense as the court clerk read out the lengthy indictment. The audience was extremely crowded, and guards patrolled the streets near the court. Trotsky, as in the previous hearing, was not listed as a key defendant and remains at large. The indictment alleges that all the defendants conspired under Trotsky's direction to contact Germany, Poland, and Japan to undermine the Soviet regime. It also claimed that Trotsky had negotiated with Hitler's representative Hess in Berlin, agreeing that in the event of war, Radek's faction should obey the German General Staff and engage in military sabotage and espionage. Radek was accused of organizing a "parallel center" to continue working after Trotsky's center failed. The so-called Trotsky center is the group that Zinoviev and Kamenev, who were executed, were accused of joining. It is alleged that the "parallel center" also planned to allow Japan to use the oil resources of Sakhalin when Japan attacked the United States, and to facilitate Japan's conquest of China. The defendants are also accused of espionage and terrorist acts, and of attempting to restore capitalism in Russia. The defendants also include former Deputy Commissioner of Heavy Industry Pipikov, Commissioner of Agriculture Lalov from 1930 to 1934, former Director of the Middle East Railway Siliblekov, and Troparis, who testified in the trial of German engineer Stickling last winter. (Reuters, 23rd)

[Moscow] Regarding the case of the "parallel center," an anti-revolutionary organization established by the Trotsky faction, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court publicly questioned the defendants today. Presiding Judge Ulekh, Prosecutor General Vyshinsky, and defendants Knyazev, Pukin, and Arnot were defended by lawyers Brandt Gamatov and Gasnazev, while the remaining defendants defended themselves. After the indictment was read in court, all of the defendants pleaded guilty. (Havas, 23rd)

### Army Opposes Party Members Joining the Cabinet

Candidates for New Army Minister: Sugiyama or Itagaki

[Tokyo] The Army's hopes for the next cabinet can be broadly divided into the following:

(1) The next cabinet must have a deep understanding of the seriousness of the current international situation, strive to develop Japan's national power externally, implement new policies internally, and recruit sincere and enthusiastic individuals to form a strong and capable cabinet.

(2) The new cabinet must implement new policies in all aspects of government, strengthen national defense, stabilize the lives of the people, and resolutely implement strong national policies. This should be its major mission. Cabinet members must be recruited from individuals who have a full understanding of the emergency situation. At the same time, it should absolutely reject any compromise or collusion with political parties that have different understandings of the situation.

(3) If it seeks cooperation with such political parties or appoints members of such parties as cabinet members, the Army will find it difficult to assist such a cabinet, and it will hesitate to recommend a replacement for the outgoing Army Minister. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] After the collapse of the Hirota cabinet, the most important issue in organizing the next cabinet is the question of who will be the next Army Minister. The military believes that General Sugiyama Moto, the current Supervisor of Education, or Lieutenant General Koiso Kuniaki, Commander of the Korean Army, and Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, are promising candidates. One of these three will be selected. It would be easiest for General Sugiyama to take office, but it will also depend on the opinion of the one in charge of forming the new cabinet. If he advocates implementing active reform policies, then Lieutenant General Itagaki's candidacy is considered the most promising. (Domei, 23rd)

### House of Peers and House of Representatives Decide to Adjourn

Until New Cabinet Is Established

[Tokyo] The Hirota Cabinet decided to resign en masse on the 23rd. Therefore, following precedent, the House of Peers and the House of Representatives are scheduled to convene a formal meeting on the 25th to decide to adjourn until the announcement of the establishment of a new cabinet. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] At the cabinet meeting on the 23rd, it was decided to appoint the current Minister of Justice, Hayashi Raisaburo, as a member of the House of Peers chosen by imperial command, in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 4 of the House of Peers Ordinance. (Domei, 23rd)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hirota announced at today's cabinet meeting that he would recommend Foreign Minister Arita as a member chosen by imperial command. Foreign Minister Arita said that he had some reservations and requested to decline the imperial appointment, so the request was temporarily suspended. (Domei, 23rd)

### British Newspaper Commentary

[London] The Manchester Guardian recently commented on the resignation of the Hirota Cabinet in Japan, stating: "The path that Japan should choose in the future is different from the paths chosen by Italy and Germany in the past. Italy and Germany chose one of the two paths of Fascism and Socialism. However, the two paths that Japan should choose in the future are either a military oligarchy that disregards the interests of big business or a civilian bureaucracy. It must choose one of these two paths. If a revolution occurs in Japan, it is more likely to be instigated by the military than by farmers and workers. What the military hopes for is the mutual opposition between the government and the Diet. However, as this tendency towards opposition deepens, it not only causes concern among those who advocate democracy, but also makes major political parties such as the Seiyukai and Minseito feel deeply uneasy about the threat to their own existence." (Havas, 23rd)

### Rampant Smuggling in North China

Li Xing Arrives in Tianjin to Negotiate Crackdown, but Results are Nil; Rōnin Disguise Themselves as Passengers to Transport Contraband

Tianjin Correspondence: The newly appointed Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of the Ministry of Finance's Railway Transport, Li Xing, arrived in Tianjin on the 13th of this month to assume office. This time, Li's arrival carries the Ministry of Finance's new hope for anti-smuggling efforts in North China, with the expectation that Li can negotiate satisfactorily with all parties and eradicate the source of smuggling in a short period. However, the only methods instructed are to have Li directly consult with the authorities in North China to seek assistance from military and police agencies for interception, with no other means available. Therefore, after arriving in Tianjin, Li, following this directive, repeatedly discussed the matter with Mei Weiliang, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, and Zhang Zizhong, the Mayor of Tianjin. However, the highest local authorities felt that the diplomatic hurdles had not been overcome, and empty talk of assistance remained superficial. If the military and police agencies disregarded the facts and acted rashly, they would be directly responsible on behalf of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau. Consequently, no concrete action was indicated. Recently, Feng Zhi'an, the Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, came to Tianjin to visit foreign dignitaries. Li Xing also visited him and made the same plea. Feng's response was no different from that of the municipal authorities. Therefore, Li's efforts in Tianjin for more than ten days have yielded no results. The only hope now lies in what Song Zheyuan will say. If Song allows and instructs military and police agencies to assist in unison, there may still be hope for anti-smuggling efforts. Otherwise, the Anti-Smuggling Bureau's move to Tianjin and the replacement of Ansier with Li Xing will not remedy the situation. Song has been in Tianjin for three days, and Li has requested an appointment but has not received a response. It is estimated that a meeting will be difficult to obtain this week.

With the Spring Festival less than two weeks away, the markets in various cities and towns have always been very active at the end of the lunar year, and it is also an opportunity for the large-scale sale of smuggled goods. Therefore, smuggling merchants have recently revived the practice of using heavy-duty trucks to transport goods out of Tianjin. After 6:00 PM every night, the road from Xiaoyingmen in western Tianjin to Baoding and Beiping is filled with a continuous stream of vehicles, with at least 15 trucks in each convoy. Although there are customs officers stationed at the branch checkpoint in that area, they often suffer beatings and injuries from rōnin when they try to intercept too strictly. Therefore, whenever large convoys of smuggled goods pass through, they can only pretend not to see them and let them pass. Only when there are small, scattered batches or no rōnin escorts do they dare to intercept. Currently, there is no effective way to combat smuggling in the suburbs. As for the smuggled goods transported by the Jinpu Railway, effective interception was achieved after July last year. However, this good phenomenon was not maintained permanently. Starting last week, rōnin have again been forming groups of twenty or thirty, disguising themselves as passengers, buying tickets, and boarding Jinpu Railway cars. Each person carries luggage and parcels containing artificial silk, sugar, seafood, and other items, some carrying over a hundred catties, and others carrying sixty kilograms. Customs officers, fearing that they are in large groups and armed, dare not inspect them directly. As a result, the southbound passenger cars departing from Tianjin every night are crowded, and the strange phenomenon of last spring has reappeared. These smuggled goods are mostly transported to Cangxian Botouzhen and various cities and towns along the border between Shandong and Hebei, where they are sold at low prices, also in an attempt to take advantage of the Spring Festival opportunity to sell in large quantities. Recently, Li Tonghua, Deputy Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of Railway Transport, is deploying prevention and interception efforts between Dezhou and Jinan for this matter. However, judging from the situation, it is still feared that it will be impossible to completely prevent smuggling north of Dezhou. (21st)

### The "Minzu" Ferry Traveling Between Guangzhou and Jiangmen Sinks After Hitting a Reef

Over a Hundred Passengers and Crew Drown; Estimated Total Loss of Approximately 150,000 Yuan

Guangzhou Correspondence: Jiangmen Town in Guangdong Province is one of the four largest cities in the province, with thriving commerce and accessible transportation. It is also the waterway through which Enping, Kaiping, Taishan, and Xinhui counties enter and exit. Therefore, people from these four counties often travel between the provincial capital and their hometowns by taking the Jiangmen ferry. As a result, the shipping industry there is very developed. Among the ferries traveling between Guangzhou and Jiangmen, the "Minzu" ("National") ferry, due to its large number of passengers, has seen its business thrive. The "Minzu" was always the leader among the rural ferries, with careful protection, complete equipment, and a hull larger than other ships. It had traveled safely between Guangzhou and Jiangmen for many years. Unexpectedly, Guangdong Province has been experiencing a series of natural disasters and human calamities in the past month. Amidst the rice shortage and just after the horrific train burning incident on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, the "Minzu" ferry suddenly sank, drowning hundreds of people. Misfortunes never come singly; this is truly a portrayal of today's Guangdong society. A summary of the tragic sinking is described below:

Dangerous Shoals

Ganzhu Shoal, located in Shunde County, has long been a historically perilous passage. Shoals and rocks stand in the river, and when the West River flows to this point, it is blocked by the shoals, causing it to pool and swirl, with the sound of the waves reaching for miles. During the flood season in spring and summer, the water is as swift as arrows, and even small steamships have difficulty going upstream at full power. In winter, when the water is low, it is also difficult for ships to cross the shoal. The rugged boulders in the shoal, especially the one known as "Incense Burner Rock," are particularly dangerous. Opposite Incense Burner Rock is the Tin Hau Temple, built by superstitious villagers. According to legend, ships passing by offer prayers at the temple and then cross the shoal safely. Incense Burner Rock is located in front of the temple, serving as a natural incense burner for the temple. Its name is said to have come from this. Another theory says that countless ships have encountered accidents here throughout history, and the rock is the incense burner for the water burials of the dead. From this speculation, the difficulty of the shoal passage can be seen. As for the facts of shipwrecks, not to mention those in the distant past, in recent years alone, ferry accidents here have occurred almost every year. The Heshan Steamboat, Gongyuan Steamboat, and the Yong'an ferry, all traveling from Guangzhou to Ducheng, have sunk one after another, each time drowning hundreds of people. Last year, someone suggested that the shoal rocks be bombed to reduce the force of the water and facilitate navigation. However, after weighing the pros and cons, it was difficult to do. If the shoal rocks were leveled, the raging torrent of the West River would rush down during the flood season, unstoppable, pouring thousands of miles downstream, and the villages would suffer. The bombing of the shoal was halted after villagers pleaded and appealed. Therefore, Ganzhu Shoal remains a major obstacle to navigation.

The Accident

The "Minzu" ferry traveling between Guangzhou and Jiangmen was scheduled to depart from Guangzhou at 7:00 PM every day. On the afternoon of the 19th, it departed as usual, carrying over 340 passengers and a large cargo. It passed through Huanglian Leiliu, which belongs to Shunde County, and entered Lihai, cut out of Dengjiao Sha, and saw the Jielong Bridge, and then went up the shoal. At about 3:00 AM on the 20th, when it reached Incense Burner Rock, the Model steamship, which was towing the "Minzu," opened up to full speed and crossed the shoal. However, because the "Minzu" ferry was heavy and the water was shallow, it still could not cross the shoal after two attempts. Finally, on the third attempt, the hull crashed into a reef with a loud bang. The cargo hold was pierced, forming a huge hole. River water gurgled in. At this time, the passengers were awakened from their sleep and realized there was an accident. They all scrambled to escape, shouting for help. Those familiar with swimming jumped into the water and fled. Before long, the passengers gathered tightly in one corner, the hull tilted, and the entire ship went into the water. The hundreds of lives were submerged along with the cabin.

Rescue

When the "Minzu" ferry sank, the Model steamship, which was ahead, turned back to rescue. It rescued more than ten people on the spot and transported them to the shore. At the same time, ferries operating on the same route, such as the Zhonghua, Da Jiu Jiang, Hexing, and Da An, passed by one after another and rushed forward to rescue them. They rescued a total of about 180 people and sent them to Jiangmen. At that time, the Jiangmen Mingshan Hall immediately sent four rescue boats, and the Red Cross sent one boat, to the scene of the accident to rescue survivors. They arrived at about 11:00 AM on the 20th and recovered seven male and female bodies from Youkeng in Ganzhu Shoal, mostly dressed in cloth clothing, about thirty or forty years old. There was also the body of a young girl. It is estimated that there were over a hundred bodies trapped in the cabin that had not surfaced. As for the cargo on the ship, it had all been washed away. The sunken "Minzu" only had its mast and canopy visible. More than ten crew members survived, but eight were missing. Those who were rescued were either sent back to Jiangmen on their own, or the injured were treated at the Ganzhu Airen Shantang Hospital nearby. On the same day, the Ganzhu Shantang also sent local workers to retrieve the bodies.

Retrieving Bodies

After the survivors returned to Jiangmen, they reported to the county government. County Magistrate Li of Xinhui immediately telegraphed the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting that the province send a body recovery team and a lifting ship to handle the matter. At the same time, the Model steamship sent more than 20 of the rescued passengers to the provincial capital and reported to the shipping company. The company immediately hired four lifeboats and four crane ships, ordering the Model steamship to transport them to the scene of the accident to carry out the rescue. On the same day, the Fangbian Hospital also sent a rescue team and a body inspection team, equipped with tools, to the scene by boat. Later, they used boats to purchase eighty or ninety coffins and transport them to encoffin the bodies, and they photographed and numbered the bodies found nearby in order to encoffin them, kept them on the shore to wait for relatives to claim them, and no longer transported them to the province, so as to avoid provincial procedures. The lifeboat and rescue team sent by the province arrived at the scene of the accident at 8:00 PM on the 20th, but it was at night and it was not convenient to work. It was not until the morning of the 21st that the crane was used to lift the sunken ship and retrieve the bodies trapped in the cabin. Therefore, the actual number of drowning deaths is still under investigation. However, based on the number of over a hundred people rescued, the number of drowning deaths must be over a hundred.

Losses

This time, the "Minzu" ship was heading to Jiangmen. Because it was near the end of the year, many people in the countryside were purchasing goods from the province and transporting them back by ferry. It is estimated that the cargo on board was worth about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, the passengers' property loss was about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and the loss of the "Minzu" ship, including the ship's value and installation costs, was a total of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, for a total loss of 150,000 yuan. The bodies of the drowned were mostly swept away by the turbulent current, and some were deposited among the reefs and had not yet surfaced. The bodies that had been salvaged were mostly bloated, making identification difficult.

Other News

According to the crew, if the passengers had remained calm when the "Minzu" ferry sank and had not panicked, it might have been possible to save them. When the ship was built, an extra layer of wooden piles was added to the bottom of the ship to prevent the bottom from being pierced, and the protection of the wooden piles could also be used for repairs. However, this time, the passengers gathered in one corner, causing the hull to tilt, and it was difficult to repair. The ship's passenger capacity was limited to 382, but on this day, it was only carrying 344 passengers. The waterline on the side of the ship was supposed to be eight inches from the water surface, but that night, the load not only did not exceed the limit, but the waterline was more than one foot from the water surface.

### Details of the Xin Beijing Ship Accident

The Shipowner's Negligence Caused the Accident, Running Aground on a Reef; Passengers Were Transferred Safely, but Damage Was Significant

Ningbo Correspondence: The Taikoo Yanghang's "Xin Beijing" ("New Beijing") ship, which operates on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, is known for its solid hull, with a net tonnage of 2,300 tons. It has been operating between Shanghai and Ningbo for a long time. The shipowner is a Dutchman named Mai Gencai, and the compradore is a Ningbo native named Zheng Renye. There are over 300 officers and crew members on board. On the evening of the 20th, it departed from Shanghai for Ningbo, carrying seven or eight hundred male and female passengers and 2,820 pieces of cargo. At 4:05 AM on the 21st, the second mate, a Westerner named Hua'erlin, as usual, handed over the responsibility of steering the ship to the shipowner, Mai Gencai, as the ship was about to reach the Zhenhai Estuary. Unexpectedly, Mai was negligent for a moment and did not immediately observe the course of the sea. Therefore, he did not give any instructions to the helmsman. The helmsman, who had a lot of experience, asked Mai if there were any changes in direction. Mai then noticed and looked at the sea, realizing that they were near the Laotaipo Reef. He urgently ordered the helmsman to turn the rudder and change direction, but it was too late. The bow of the ship crashed into the Laotaipo Reef and ran aground. At that time, there was a loud bang, and the ship shook violently. All the passengers on board were awakened from their sleep, some falling from their bunks, and others being bumped. Fortunately, there were few injuries. The Laotaipo Reef is only half an hour's journey from the Zhenhai Estuary, and is on the old Hongyuan Fort sea area, next to Longshan, opposite Lishan, and at the entrance of Xiaogangmen. It is the only dangerous navigation route to enter the Zhenhai Estuary. There is a wooden pole sign on the reef to indicate danger. As the ship touched the reef, the hull was stuck by the reef. The front part of the hull was grounded on the reef, and the bow was raised high. The bottom of the front hold was broken, and water entered to a depth of more than a zhang. Fortunately, there was no cargo in the front hold, and it was separated from the middle hold. Although the hull lost its balance and tilted slightly, it was not about to capsize because the bottom of the ship was stuck on the reef. When Mai saw the great disaster, he immediately ordered a radio message to be sent to the Shanghai headquarters to ask for help. At 7:30 AM, the Ningbo office received a telegram from the headquarters, and urgently hired ten ships from Zhenbei, Lianyi, Yin Ci, and Yin Yu, to tow barges to the scene of the accident to rescue passengers. The Jianghai Customs No. 25 patrol ship Yunxing, the foreign water police bureau's Tai'an ship, and a British warship all sailed nearby to guard. As of 4:00 PM, all of the ship's passengers had been rescued and transported to Ningbo, with only slight luggage losses. Among the passengers was Ms. Xu, Zhang Xueliang's concubine, who had come from Shanghai to Ningbo to visit scenic spots with a Chinese and Western entourage. She suffered a great fright as a result. The Shanghai headquarters has now sent a HSBC tugboat to the Laotaipo Reef to prepare to rescue the ship from danger. On one hand, the Ningbo office hired more than 20 barges to unload the cargo. The extent of the damage to the ship is still under investigation.

### Songjiang Plans to Dredge the Gu Pu Tang

The county's water conservancy relies on the Huangpu River in the south and the Mao River in the north, while the Gu Pu Tang actually uses the Mao River as its tailwater. The pond is located between the first and fourth districts, benefiting fields and acres in fifteen or sixteen townships, and the Shihudang and Xiazhuang townships in the fifth district are also within the scope of the requisitioned labor. The Gu Pu Tang of this National Labor Service term has been lacking dredging for many years, affecting water conservancy and transportation. The county government submitted a request to the Construction Department for approval to dredge. The county appointed the first and fourth district chiefs as the chief and deputy directors of the river project, and also hired local people from the two districts, such as Zhang Jiliang, as members. The surveying and mapping has been completed. The fifth district chief, Ye Lilin, was added as the deputy director. On the 22nd, the county government convened a meeting to decide to submit the register of benefited fields and acres within the scope of the requisitioned labor by February 5th, in order to compile and verify the allocation of labor. The start date for construction was set for February 15th, and all sections will be dredged uniformly. The county magistrate ordered the township police to be responsible for investigating and reporting the field and acre registers and submitting them to the district for forwarding.

### Kunshan Mobilizes to Search and Arrest Opium Smokers

Since the start of the general review of opium addicts in the county, in addition to the general mobilization of the military and police, staff from various agencies have been consulted to assist in the investigation and arrest. More than 400 opium smokers have been arrested and sent to the county hospital for compulsory drug rehabilitation or investigation. The search and arrest are continuing in order to eradicate opium.

### Suzhou Xu Wancheng's Appeal Judgment

Xu Wancheng, an editor at the Shanghai Longwen Bookstore, was sued for defaming a judge. Because Xu was dissatisfied with the first-instance judgment of the Wuxian District Court, he appealed to the High Court. After several court hearings, the judgment was issued yesterday, the original judgment was revoked, and Xu Wancheng was fined thirty yuan for spreading words that were sufficient to damage the reputation of others, with a one-year suspended sentence.

Guangxi Inspection Group Arrives in Suzhou

Zhang Renmin and ten other members of the Guangxi Inspection Group arrived in Suzhou by car from Hangzhou at noon on the 23rd to conduct inspections. The Wuxian Branch of the China General Labor Union held a banquet to welcome them. Yan Xinqi of the Suzhou Lunsha Factory delivered a welcome speech. They are scheduled to visit major factories such as Su Lun, Taihe, Huasheng, and Hongsheng on the 24th. They are scheduled to leave Suzhou for Wuxi at 4:00 PM and then go to Changzhou and Zhenjiang for inspections.

### Measurement Team Wins Zilin Cup

Yoyo Suffers Defeat at Two to Three

After the Yoyo and Measurement teams secured the right to compete in the final of the Zilin Cup, a competition involving thirteen teams, the final took place yesterday at Hongkou Park. Prior to the match, Yoyo was highly favored. After the teams took to the field, Yoyo also seemed to have the advantage in terms of both strength and formation. However, contrary to expectations, the lackluster Measurement team eliminated Yoyo with a score of three to two, and the coveted silver cup was relinquished. The details of the battle between the two teams are described below:

First Half: As a result of the coin toss, Measurement attacked first, advancing aggressively. The right forward, Muller, took a shot, but Yoyo's defender, Chen Xiaoping, made a clumsy mistake, scoring an own goal and gifting Measurement a point. Shortly after, Wang Zhangxian scored, making it one to one. Subsequently, Yoyo was awarded a penalty kick due to an infraction by Measurement's inside forward. Shen Shiqi took the shot, but it hit the post and bounced out. However, Shen Shiqi soon received a pass from the center-back line and scored, putting Yoyo ahead at two to one. However, there were more opportunities, but due to slow footwork, they were missed.

Second Half: After the lemon break, Measurement's attack was very strong within five minutes, but soon Yoyo took control. However, due to continued sluggishness, they missed countless opportunities. After about 20 minutes of stalemate, Measurement made a comeback, and the entire team advanced into Yoyo's territory. Zhao Zisheng, eager to save the situation, accidentally handled the ball, resulting in a penalty kick. One of Measurement's central defenders, Heineley, scored, making it two to two. Measurement continued to press fiercely, and Yoyo's territory was in extreme danger. Fortunately, the situation soon stabilized. Later, Shen Shiqi had a free kick opportunity from 20 yards out, with an excellent angle. However, due to a lack of support, the opportunity was not fully realized. Finally, in the last minute, Measurement's center forward, Harrison, shot. Wang Zhigao was too careless, slightly blocking the shot with his hands, but it still went in. Measurement won the championship with a score of three to two. The awards ceremony was held on the spot, and the Measurement team took the Zilin Cup away. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Measurement Team:

Our country's boxing master, Mr. Feng Weiren, was invited by Yoshimura Fumio, a Japanese resident in Tianjin, to compete in a Sino-Japanese championship match at the Alber Road Jai Alai Stadium yesterday. Prior to this headline match, there were nine boxing matches, and another one was added temporarily, making a total of eleven matches. Yesterday, there were three Japanese boxers. Miyagawa Saburo at 120 pounds lost to French boxer Moni shortly after the start of the first round. Akita Yutaka at 147 pounds also lost to Russian boxer Lev Renigu. In the morning, Yoshimura and Feng fought a ten-round match of two minutes each. Feng's arm injury was still being treated, so a doctor was present on site. After the start, Feng was very brave in the first round, and Yoshimura's nose was injured by Feng, almost forcing him to quit. After being persuaded by his teammates, he continued the match. From the second round, Yoshimura's counterattack became very intense. In the third round, Yoshimura elbowed Feng's neck, causing a loud uproar. In the fourth round, Yoshimura rushed forward, but Feng cleverly dodged, almost causing Yoshimura to fall. From the ninth round, Feng gradually showed signs of fatigue due to not having fully recovered his strength. Both sides were covered in blood. In the sixth round, Feng was forced into the corner twice, almost falling. Yoshimura gained the upper hand again in the eighth round. In the ninth and tenth rounds, Feng gradually resumed his offense, but was finally suppressed again, resulting in a crushing defeat. However, the failure due to the unhealed arm injury is not enough to judge a hero.

### The Sixth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Sociological Society Opened Yesterday

More than 30 members from various places attended. The meeting will continue today to discuss social affairs.

The sixth annual meeting of the Chinese Sociological Society was held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 9:00 AM yesterday. The opening ceremony was held in the morning, and papers were read. In the afternoon, the curriculum was discussed. The papers will continue to be read this morning, and social affairs will be discussed this afternoon. There will be a dinner in the evening. The details are as follows:

Attending Members

Including Wu Jingchao • Wu Zelin (Jinan), Zhao Chengxin (Yanjing), Sun Benwen (Central), Hua Dingyi (Law School), Yan Jingyao (Municipal Council), Qian Shengzong (Fudan), Long Guanhai (Huigen Women's University), Yu Zhenji • Yang Zhongming (Guanghua), Chen Shaoji • Zhong Guiyang (Daxia), Hu Tigan (Henan), Jin Wuzhou • Gu Zhengshu (Shanghai)

Opening Remarks

The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department attended. First, Chairman Wu Jingchao delivered the opening remarks, stating that the sixth annual meeting of the Society was originally scheduled to be held at Tsinghua University in Beiping last summer. Later, it was proposed to postpone it to August and hold the annual meeting jointly with various academic groups. However, the negotiations were unsuccessful, and the meeting was postponed to the 1st and 2nd of this month to be held independently. Due to the sudden Xi'an Incident, it was inconvenient for members from other places to attend, so it was postponed to today and tomorrow. In addition to the reading of papers, there will also be discussions on social affairs. The central issue is the improvement of Chinese sociology. On the one hand, we will examine whether the curriculum of the sociology department meets the needs of students, and whether the work of students after graduation is compatible with the training they received at the school. The revision and deletion of curriculum aspects need to be discussed together. On the other hand, we also need to discuss the future direction of sociology. Sociology is a new science with a short history in China. The work in the past one or two decades has focused on the introduction of foreign sociological theories. Now, do we need to create Chinese sociology and pay attention to the actual problems of Chinese society? This also requires the joint expression of opinions. Secondly, the issue of the continuation of the Sociological Monthly will also be raised for discussion at this meeting. Finally, I have one feeling. The first annual meeting of the Society was also held in Shanghai. That is, in terms of numbers, the Chinese sociology department is superficially prosperous, but there are not many people who study it. Now, although the sociology department has decreased, the quality is much more advanced than before.

Reading Papers

After the representatives of the Municipal Party read their speeches, the papers were read. ㊀ Zhao Chengxin, Community Research and the Construction of Sociology, ㊁ Series of Articles on the Methodological Problems of Studying Chinese Culture, ㊂ Moshi Men • Recommendation for the Formation of Social Work Training in China ㊃ Yan Xinzhe • Theory and Practice of Social Investigation Design,

Discussion Content

At 2:00 PM, the content of the sociology department curriculum in the future was discussed. In addition to the professors from various universities attending, Liu Zhanen, the principal of Shanghai University, also participated in the discussion. Chairman Wu Zelin, ㊀ Pay attention to cultivating research work, such as investigation statistics and entering the village, ㊁ Pay attention to and expand the training of social work, such as social relief, prison management, factory inspection, worker welfare, and other talents, ㊂ Training talents in rural service, especially focusing on the training of district chiefs and other talents. After deliberation, the opinions expressed by each professor will be submitted to the next council to set up a curriculum research committee to draft a preliminary reform plan and send it to each member for comments before sorting it out for the reference of each university.

### Jiangsu Literary Writers Association Issues Declaration to Suppress Treason and Eliminate Communism

Responding to the Call of the China Cultural Construction Association

The Jiangsu Literary Association recently issued a declaration in response to the call of the China Cultural Construction Association. The original text is as follows: After reading the call of the China Cultural Construction Association, we appeal to the Central Government to uphold discipline by punishing traitors, pacify the people by suppressing bandits, and strengthen the country to resist foreign enemies. We feel that these three things are indeed the key to national salvation and survival at present, especially the suppression of communist bandits, which is even more urgent. We know why Zhang Xueliang, the chief culprit of the Shaanxi Incident, and the rebellious generals Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong, did such crazy things to destroy the nation. This is obviously because the communist bandits colluded with them, and they were happy to be fooled by the communist bandits, absurdly trying to organize a "national defense government" and unite with a "people's front" to destroy the country and exterminate the race, digging their own graves. China now needs unity, but they deliberately try to carve up the country. China now needs construction, but they deliberately destroy it. To be honest, they are no longer Chinese, they are traitors who sell out China, they are the public enemy of the people, and they are also puppets of the communist bandits. We don't know why the bandit puppet army on the border is so rampant. Of course, there is the background of imperialist aggression, but the communist bandits disrupt the rear and incite the front line, meticulously hindering the progress of the national army, which is a very serious fact. At the same time, the communist bandits collude with red imperialism, and their cruel harm to China is even more unforgivable. Because of the communist bandits, traitors dare to be so tyrannical and puppets dare to be so rampant. Society is so unstable and the people's livelihood is so haggard. Therefore, suppressing traitors and resisting the enemy must be based on suppressing the communist bandits. China must be self-reliant, and the communist bandits who destroy unity and construction must be eliminated first. Furthermore, to eliminate the heinous communist bandits, we must fundamentally eliminate the red ideology that anesthetizes young people and poisons the society. In recent years, red ideology has been spreading poison under the guise of so-called leftist writers and popular literature and art, stealing a good name, and singing loudly about "national defense literature" and "national liberation movement," which is endless, deceiving the world and confusing the public. A few boring literati do not hesitate to demean their personality and speak up for the communist bandits. Heretical ideas anesthetize young people, which is really a fundamental disaster. We feel that it is important to use military force to eliminate the communist bandits, but it is even more important to eliminate the communist bandits from the ideological point of view. We must follow this inevitable path to settle people's hearts and support righteousness, so that the will of the whole people is concentrated on the belief in the Three Principles of the People, and then our nation has the possibility of revival. Now, the survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation have reached a critical moment. We hope that all compatriots in the country will unite to support the central government, eliminate all reactionaries, and hope that the cultural circles of the whole country will recognize the current political line, expose the communist bandits' conspiracy, vigorously expose the evil theories such as the People's Front, lead the youth, and enlighten the masses to break through the current national crisis from the ideological point of view and complete the cultural construction of the Three Principles of the People. This is our declaration.

Commercial News

### Yarn and Cotton

The Short Sellers Change Course According to the Wind

It is rumored that there is a long position company organization. Yarn prices have rebounded and are particularly tight this month.

The yarn market has been trending firm this month, and the wind of price increases has started again. It is rumored that a long position company organization has been formed for the February period, ready to fight. As a result, short sellers are concentrating on covering their positions for this month and simultaneously shorting the February period. Previously, the price for this month was small, so there were many arbitrageurs. Therefore, the spot market for this month is dry, and there is only one day of trading left tomorrow. Many are closing out their floating positions, and the market is rising. Although 2,400 bales of spot yarn were traded this month, fellow traders accounted for 1,300 bales, buying January futures to prevent a short squeeze.

Short Sellers Covering Delivery Positions

The pre-market opening of the yarn market saw the near-month contract being pulled up by buyers, causing tightness on the floor. Floating traders covered their positions, and the market slowly rose. With only today and tomorrow remaining for trading this month, short sellers have already covered their delivery positions and shifted them to the February period. Therefore, the recent momentum has been strong. However, the forward months saw a decline in the price of third-grade yarn due to sluggish yarn sales and fewer buyers, while spot yarn business became even more sluggish. The results of the auction showed that the near-month contract rose by one to one point three yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the forward months rose by three point six jiao. In the afternoon opening, the near-month contract was covered by short sellers for profit-taking. The market condition gradually tightened, but the forward months remained peaceful. After one round of trading, the near-month contract continued to advance, rising over fifty yuan. The results showed that the near-month contract rose by one point five yuan to eight jiao, and the forward months rose by two point three jiao compared to the morning closing price. The sellers included Changfeng with 1,150 bales, Taichang with 1,500 bales, Dafu with 850 bales, Xincheng with 750 bales, Hexing with 1,600 bales, Wang Taixing with 800 bales, Dachangcheng with one hand of bales, Hengchang with 900 bales, Dachang with 1,000 bales, Yongchang with 600 bales, Changji with 700 bales, and Senkang with 1,250 bales. The buyers included Fukang with 1,100 bales, Jifeng with 1,600 bales, Yuda with 1,050 bales, Mingde with 900 bales, Gengfeng with 1,700 bales, Runkang with 1,550 bales, Xiecheng with 900 bales, Yuan Yi with 1,300 bales, and Tonghe with 650 bales. A comparison of market prices is shown below:

Over Two Thousand Bales of Spot Yarn Traded

Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics for all gangs buying period spot yarn throughout the day show 2,403 bales traded, with a price increase of one yuan. Shangyin spot yarn traded 540 bales. The purchase amount for each gang is as follows:

Cotton Market Has Little Glory or Shame

The cotton market is dull and lifeless, with no glory or shame to speak of. Therefore, the ups and downs are minimal, and the market state is increasingly stagnant. Overseas American and Indian cotton markets are also in a state of hovering and hesitation, so there is even less color.

Cotton Prices Do Not Deviate Much, Only Five Fen or One Jiao Up or Down

The pre-market opening of the cotton auction saw a slight increase in each month's contract, but trading in the market was particularly quiet. Both the long and short sides lacked excitement, so buying and selling were very rare. The overseas cotton industry situation also did not escape the tired state. The results of the cotton auction showed that each month's contract rose by five fen to one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, the market situation did not change at all, fluctuating five fen up or down, with very little trading. The results showed that the February and March contracts fell by five fen to one jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the rest remained unchanged. The sellers included Xinchang with 1,200 dan, Yongda with 1,600 dan, Changyu with 1,000 dan, Dachangcheng with 1,100 dan, Jiankang with 1,300 dan, Changhe with 6,300 dan, Yuanda with 1,100 dan, and Jinghua with three hands of 400 dan. The buyers included Tongji with 2,100 dan, Deda with 1,000 dan, Dafu with 3,100 dan, Yukang with 2,400 dan, Jinchang with 1,100 dan, Changfeng with 1,800 dan, Shengyuan with 1,300 dan, Fengtai with 1,400 dan, Renfeng with 1,000 dan, Yuan Yi with 2,100 dan, Hengchang with 2,100 dan, Yikang with 1,000 dan, and Shenji with 1,200 dan. A comparison of market prices is shown below:

Tongyao Cotton Arrives, 3,400 Bales

Spot cotton consumption is mediocre, and factory sales are not smooth. Sources: Yao cotton 2,186 bales, Tong cotton 1,218 bales. Haiti tip, 48.75. Hengfeng factory import, 300 bales. Spot goods delivered to the factory, Lingshi cotton, 67.72. Zhongxin factory import, 420 pieces. Also, again.

Yarn and Cloth Dividends Set New Records

Semi-annual Surplus, Dividend of Twelve Yuan Per Share. Brokers' Profits Exceed Tens of Thousands to Two or Three Hundred Thousand.

The business situation of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange in the 25th year was particularly developed, and the income increased sharply, creating a new record for the 15 years since the establishment of the exchange. The second half of the year's business was even better than the first half. The accounts have already been settled, and a dividend of eleven yuan per share has been distributed. On the broker side, profits were also substantial. The largest profit earners made 260,000 yuan, and those with surpluses of 230,000 yuan were even more numerous. Cotton merchants were slightly inferior in comparison, but they were also considered not bad. The reason for the improvement in business is that the bond and securities markets trended dimly, and the target of general speculators shifted and gathered in the yarn and cotton market. Therefore, the waves were particularly large, and market prices rose and fell rapidly. Cotton yarn had a price range of 75 to 76 yuan, and cotton had a change of 8 to 9 yuan. On the whole, it was the most satisfactory year in the history of the exchange.

US Cotton Industry Limits Purchases

Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market situation was firm but lacked activity. Each month rose or fell by one pound note. The near-month contract was particularly firm due to the limited-price orders from fellow traders. In general, fellow traders are waiting for the official announcement of the cotton loan issue. As a result, the spot and futures markets are all clear, and new accounts are flat. The footing of low-grade spot cotton is increasingly soft, and the closing is firm. The spot price is up two pound notes, and the futures price is unchanged to up two pound notes. British spot cotton fell six points, and futures rose one point. Indian cotton was initially weak due to re-sales by buyers, then firm due to retail long positions buying in. Finally, the market price softened again due to old long positions selling off. The Pingguo letter fell 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, Aomula fell 1 to earn rupees, and Bai Luo Creek fell 1.15 rupees. Original telegram left, (22nd telegram).

According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 23rd is that Bai Luo Creek is 225 rupees, and Aomula is 205.5 rupees, down 0.25 rupees. Pingguoer is 178 rupees, unchanged.

The Price of Third-Grade Yarn Falls, but the Price of Cotton Still Rises

On the 23rd, Dagu telegram: Spot yarn fell 2.3 yuan. 16-count fan surface, 251 yuan, unchanged. 20-count goldfish, 270 yuan, down 3 yuan. 40-count five-star, 410 yuan, unchanged. 42-count pheasant, 398 yuan, down 1 yuan. Period yarn fell 0.6 to 1.7 yuan. The near-month is 268 yuan, and the forward month is 255.4 yuan. Period cotton rose 0.15 to 0.6 yuan. The near-month is 75.9 yuan, and the forward month is 77.6 yuan.

### Food

Foreign Wheat Quotes Fall, Flour and Wheat Market Suddenly Weak

The rebound started slightly in the afternoon. The near-term flour market is still flat.

After the flour market opened in the morning, each month's contract showed signs of first falling and then rebounding. This was because the price of foreign wheat, Chicago, fell 0.8 yuan in the near term, 0.4-0.5 yuan in the long term, and Canada fell 0.3-0.6 yuan. Liverpool fell 2 pence. When the opening price was set, the market sentiment deteriorated because the trend of foreign wheat was unstable and the price gradually loosened sharply. Therefore, the opening price for this month was as low as 3.815 yuan, February to 0.84 yuan, March to 0.885 yuan, and April to 0.925 yuan, a severe drop of 0.6-0.7 yuan compared to the previous day. It was convenient for each trading floor because most of the long positions were dull, and the short positions followed the market to advance, so the price was set. Until the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere was still flat this month because the delivery was approaching and the long positions had no strength to mutually dismiss. However, the forward months were tighter because the factory output was not prosperous and the floating short positions were large. Outsiders also took the opportunity to raise prices slightly, so they tightened again, rebounding 0.3-0.4 yuan from the lowest price in the morning. However, the subsequent situation still looks small domestically, but the central hub is still shifted by the good news from abroad.

After the wheat market opened in the morning, each month's contract showed a weak and lifeless market. The price of foreign wheat fell again by 0.2-0.5-0.6-0.8 yuan, and 1 penny. Domestic sales are not smooth, and foreign countries are also gradually loosening, which inevitably makes the long positions embarrassed. Therefore, the opening price for this month and January fell 0.1 yuan, and the decline for March and below was worse due to very lonely trading, a small loss of 0.6-0.7-0.8 yuan. Until the afternoon opening, it was also very tired at first, and then the flour market rebounded, and the market sentiment also turned high. Because some of the short positions in the industry were anxious to cover, the market rose 0.6-0.7 yuan. The spot wheat market fell again, and the asking price also loosened 0.6-0.7 yuan, opening Jiangbei wheat at 6.11 yuan, and Chongming wheat at 6.08 yuan, down 0.4. It is estimated that over 2,000 bales were opened.

The US and Argentina Are Expected to Have a Good Wheat Harvest

On the 22nd, the Chicago wheat market fell 1.5-2.5 fen due to the weakness of foreign markets, the settlement of floating long positions, and the extremely poor factory demand.

The Chicago wheat market trended down last week. A total of 11,436,000 bushels of wheat were loaded in the Southern Hemisphere during the week. Affected by this, prices plummeted. According to last year, Argentina's wheat shipped out about twice this number in one week. With the arrival of goods pouring in, market prices will undoubtedly be under pressure. However, the world's needs are very large. If Germany and Italy both need wheat, it may be able to offset this adverse force. The domestic factory demand is extremely poor. The outlook for the new wheat harvest is improving. The condition of wheat seedlings is above average, so it is expected that the wheat market will continue to rebound. However, some merchants are still bullish on the long-term outlook for wheat.

Customer Xian Canton Helping Cutbacks Suddenly Reduced

The Market Price Rebounds Slightly

Yesterday, the arrival of customer Xian continued, and the market inventory was even more abundant. However, the Canton help's appetite suddenly decreased. Yesterday, only more than 1,000 bales of Jiangxi machine brown rice were processed in the evening. The appetite on this street was also weak, with an estimated 2,000 bales processed. In total, less than 4,000 bales were traded. Therefore, the market price fell slightly by 0.5-0.6 fen to about 0.1 yuan. The rise and fall in the later market still depends on the digestive strength of the Canton help, because other customer helps are all receiving east at the end of the year and have no intention of getting involved, and there is no smooth appetite on this street either.

River Rice Transactions Are More Sluggish Than Before

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various helps turned into more partners than before, with a total of about 70 numbers, about 15,500-15,600 shi of goods, including more than 30 numbers of thin rice. The sales market on this street is still sluggish. The stomach is only Qingdao helping with 1,500-1,600 bales of thin rice, which leads to a weak situation, and the market situation is still difficult to support. As a result, the price of thin rice continues to fall by 0.1-0.2 yuan, and the price of thick japonica rice falls by a few fen to 0.1 yuan. According to the current situation, it seems that it is still difficult to gain a foothold. Du Yangjian is slightly soft, and Yin Bian Yuan Yi is changing because the price is higher and the arrival is surging, resulting in a sudden drop of more than 0.2 yuan.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 50 sources from various rivers downstream. The sales of various goods in the market were more sluggish than before. However, the white japonica rice moved slightly by four scattered households, the price of white japonica rice was 0.1-0.2 yuan smaller, the price of early thin rice was nearly 0.1 yuan smaller, the price of white yuan was 0.7-0.8 yuan smaller, the supply of Yangbu Jian goods was scarce, and the price was flat and weak. The price of other goods was also slightly weak.

Soybean Cake Sales Are Still Not Bad

Returning to the soybean cake market situation two days ago, the market sentiment was inevitably weak because the Dalian market situation was still softening, so the market situation was being repaired. However, the go-down route is still not bad, because the general merchants are keen on arbitrage, and the Shantou help is ordering period cake tirelessly, so the market atmosphere is still in a stable situation. Yesterday, the market opened with 3,000 pieces of spot 4-brand cake, 15,000 pieces for delivery in February, and 10,000 pieces for delivery in March. The market price is now in the repair score, February is unchanged, but March is the only setback of 0.02 yuan.

The Rise in Oilcake Prices in the Twenty-Fifth Year Was Unmatched

The Transaction Was Less Than in the Twenty-Fourth Year

Since the reform of the currency system, domestic prices of all kinds have been advancing day by day. Vegetable oils are necessary items in the world's war preparations, so the local soybean oil price, under the sudden rise of the Dalian market, followed the trend. In November and December, the sharpness of the rise was a change unprecedented in years. However, although the price rose sharply, the number of open transactions in the market for the whole year was actually one-tenth less than in the twenty-fourth year (listed below).

(Note) Each commodity is listed with two prices, the former being the market price in the 25th year and the latter being the market price in the 24th year.

### Securities

Government Bonds Are Mainly Short Covering and Swapping

Gradually Presenting a Short Squeeze Situation

Yesterday's government bond market was the last two days of the January period. The market situation was gradually showing a short squeeze due to the covering of short positions and active swaps. Floor trading was quite active, and there were still many large households selling and absorbing, resulting in a strong stalemate and forming a near-weak and far-strong trend. Tomorrow is the last day of the futures for this month, and the long and short sides will still be crushed at the time, but the firmness of the market sentiment can be a short squeeze. Yesterday morning, the opening trend was still weak. No. 4 had a daily outflow of each item, and many retail investors bought it. Except for Grade E, which was slightly better by 0.05 yuan, the rest fell 0.1-0.2 yuan. In the second round of trading, the market situation turned high. A lot of 35.44 etc. were bought, and the retail appetite became more intense. Grades E and B recovered by about 0.1 yuan. Grade A forward fell by 0.1 yuan due to continued sales in No. 4. In the afternoon opening, swap trading turned strong. 38.47, etc., and retail investors were mostly short swaps. 35.72, etc., were still buying. Grade C fell 0.1 yuan next month. Others such as B and A rose another 0.1-0.2 yuan. The closing still had a slight short squeeze trend. Floor swappers became more crowded, and market prices rose another 0.05-0.1 yuan. Grade A fell by 0.02 yuan. The overall result was that the recent unified bonds rose 0.1-0.2 yuan, and the forward months all fell by 0.05-0.1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 8,785,000 yuan. The comparison of its rise, fall, high and low is listed on the left. (Unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan)

Black Iron Sheet is Out of Stock and Very Popular

Thin Iron Opens at 75 Yuan

Black Iron Sheet. Recently, the goods arrived are very little because the set price has soared and few traders have bought them. But the go-down route is such that enameled factories, thermos factories, etc. have successively collected them, resulting in fewer inventories being purchased. Standard is rising section by section due to environmental relations. At the moment, a 2 ft., 6 ft., 18 sheet piece is sold for 13.5 yuan per knot, 1 yuan better than before. 3 ft., 6 ft. are sold for 15 yuan per dan, also 1.5 yuan better than before. It seems that the goods arriving are not many, the city inventories are weak, and the later market may be difficult to recover slightly.

Thin Iron. Yesterday the opening price has reached 75 yuan. It is said that cigarette factories, biscuit companies, etc. have successively collected them, so the market situation is excellent. The opening price is not easy to fall temporarily because the market sentiment is extremely good.

### Silk and Tea

Shanghai Factories Are Waiting for Prices to Sell

Recently, silk prices have risen and fallen repeatedly, and both buyers and sellers are hesitant. As a result, domestic and foreign silk transactions are light. Yesterday, the New York silk market, Japanese silk 83 and 75 degrees, each fell 0.04 yuan, Shanghai silk 78 degrees and Guangdong silk each fell 0.05 yuan.

Yokohama spot prices rose slightly by 2 yuan yesterday, while futures fell by 2 yuan. In the Lyon silk market, various types of raw silk have risen and fallen against each other, but the number is very small, only an increase or decrease of 0.5 francs. In the Shanghai silk market yesterday, foreign merchants, seeing that foreign silk prices were firm, weak, and unstable, mostly took a temporary wait-and-see attitude. On the Chinese side, because there is not much silk in stock domestically, they are all holding prices and waiting for opportunities, unwilling to sell lightly. It is expected that the silk market will temporarily stop. If overseas silk prices can recover substantially next week, then the Shanghai market situation will not be difficult to expand. Yesterday, both domestic and foreign silk sales were only sporadic transactions, totaling only 22 bales.

New York Buyers Cannot Get Chinese Tea

They Can Only Buy Japanese Tea for Application

The sales of green tea in the United States have recently been suddenly smooth. The transactions of Chinese Zhejiang Province Pingshui and Anhui Province Luzhuang colorless green tea are very active. Among them, Fengmei Zhenmei Zhucha and other items are particularly smooth-selling. Many merchants took the opportunity to replenish the shortage, but due to the report from Shanghai that the inventory was empty, it is said that New York tea merchants, seeing that the supply of Chinese tea could not meet the demand, have successively widely imported Japanese tea. Since the beginning of the year, the number of Japanese Zhenmei Zhenmei two green teas imported into the United States has been more than 37,000 boxes, and they are still being ordered in a continuous stream.

### Income Tax Office Hosts Representatives from All Sectors Yesterday to Explain the Significance of Implementing the New Tax

Transforming the Foundation of Public Finance by Building Upon Direct Taxes; Adjusting the People’s Burden to Make it Fair and Universal; Chamber of Commerce Representatives Hope for Uniform Implementation for Both Chinese and Foreigners

Since its implementation, the collection of income tax by the Ministry of Finance has proceeded smoothly. For the sake of facilitating its promotion, various sectors have convened meetings for research. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce even held an Income Tax Research Conference, inviting representatives from chambers of commerce in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as various trade associations in the city, to contribute the results of their research to the authorities. Liang Jingchun, Weng Zhiyong, and Zhang Miao, responsible persons from the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Department, hosted a tea party at the New Asia Hotel on the seventh floor at 5 PM yesterday to entertain the attending representatives and facilitate networking. They also invited representatives from the Party headquarters, chambers of commerce, and the press to participate and exchange ideas. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:

Mr. Liang's Report

Yesterday’s tea party was attended by Qian Sunqing, Gu Suming, and other representatives from the Income Tax Research Conference, as well as Tao Baichuan from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Ke Ganchen from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lin Kanghou from the Municipal Bankers' Association, accountants Xu Yongzuo, Pan Xulun, Xi Yushu, and over 250 other people. The director of the Affairs Department, Gao Bingfang, and the deputy director, Liang Hejun, personally hosted the event. During the tea party, Liang Hejun first gave a report, stating that since the implementation of the income tax, it has received the support of all sectors and its implementation has been smooth, which is very gratifying. He also expressed his admiration for the sincere research conducted by various sectors to further improve the collection methods. He said that income tax is a good tax system, which need not be elaborated on. However, everyone believes that there are still difficulties in its implementation and hopes that the government will adopt the opinions of all parties. Therefore, the government adopts a lenient attitude in implementation, as the purpose of implementation is to cultivate tax sources and establish a good tax system, not to focus on the amount of tax and harass the people with harsh levies. He hoped that the people, especially businessmen, would believe in and abide by the system, and that Chinese businessmen, who have always valued credit, would be able to promote it, enrich national power, and enhance the country's status. He then invited Director Gao to speak and hoped that everyone would express their opinions.

Mr. Gao's Speech

Mr. Gao said in his speech that he was very honored to have representatives from the Party Headquarters and the business community from various places present. The implementation of income tax requires the efforts of the people of the whole country, especially Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai, which are the wealthy areas and the center of industry and commerce in China. He briefly reported the significance and process of the government's adoption of the new tax as follows: ⑴ The four major policies decided by the financial conference: 1. Abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes; 2. Determine county and local budgets; 3. Consolidate old taxes; 4. Promote new taxes. The first two points, based on the economic situation in China in the past three years, although of great importance, are still passive work in the entire process of consolidating local finances and cannot achieve positive results. The third point is more meaningful, but it still has a somewhat conservative tendency and cannot be called an innovative undertaking. The last fourth point is the positive and progressive facility. The promotion of income tax is the initial step in this facility, so its significance is very important. ⑵ The significance of promoting income tax: 1. Create a direct tax to transform the direction of China's financial foundation. From China’s finance, which is built upon indirect taxes, the promotion of income tax will gradually transform the financial foundation to be built upon direct taxes. 2. Reform the tax system and improve China's tax system. The existing old taxes in China are mostly inherited from the past, and there are many criticisms of the tax system. It is hoped that the promotion of income tax will further rationalize and improve the tax system. 3. Adjust the people's burden and measure the ability to pay taxes to make it fair and universal, in line with tax principles. China’s taxes have always been unequal, with the poorer bearing a heavier burden. Income tax is levied based on ability to pay, with those with greater ability paying more, those with less paying less, and those without the ability to pay being exempt. In summary, the implementation of income tax can be described as a major reform that marks a new era in the history of Chinese finance. Moreover, the tax system is equal and fair, treating Chinese and foreigners equally without discrimination. ⑶ The current firm and unchanging policy for handling income tax: 1. Make as much use of scientific methods as possible to handle all affairs, so that tax administration is not infected with bad habits. 2. Absolutely appoint new talents to handle this new undertaking with a new spirit. 3. Accommodate the opinions of the people as much as possible. Regarding the discussion of many events in the collection of income tax, an audit committee will be organized, inviting impartial talents from various places to form it, so that taxpayers have the opportunity to participate and express their opinions, so that the government and the people can reach a consensus through mutual understanding. Based on the above three points, there are now concrete facts that can be reported. First, the collection system has been greatly reformed. The collection system of income tax is absolutely separated between collection and receipt of funds. Second, the organization of tax authorities is extremely simplified, and expenses are minimized, so that the maximum effort can be used with the minimum expenditure to do the most work. ⑷ Expectations for the national business community: 1. Hope for prosperous business and profits for merchants, so that tax revenue will also be abundant. 2. Hope to improve bookkeeping to make it easier to audit. On the one hand, the business community can more accurately budget for their own operations, and on the other hand, the government can easily handle it. 3. Hope that the people of the whole country will support the government in promoting the new tax, and even more hope that merchants will support the new good tax, on the one hand to seek smooth implementation, and on the other hand to increase strength, so that in addition to the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country for the good tax, equal tax payment for Chinese and foreigners is achieved, in order to enhance the international status.

Representatives' Speeches

The following is a summary of the speeches of representatives from various sectors: ⑴ Tao Baichuan said that the implementation of income tax is a necessary condition for realizing the Three People's Principles. 1. It is in line with the principle of the People's Livelihood, as income tax is levied based on the people's ability to pay, the people's burden is average, and tax revenue is increased to develop the national economy. 2. The realization of the People's Rights requires a capable government and people with rights. Therefore, the government must have sufficient economic capacity to collect taxes, but the people must have the right to supervise. Income tax can achieve this goal. 3. From the perspective of nationalism, in order to seek national strength and freedom and equality in international status, and to recover lost territory to raise eyebrows in the world, considerable preparation is necessary, and economic strength is especially a good plan. China's finances have always relied on customs duties and salt taxes, but once something happens, they will collapse. Only income tax can avoid this kind of difficulty in times of national crisis. Therefore, to complete the Three People's Principles, it is necessary to implement direct taxes. ⑵ Ke Ganchen said that merchants have already been implementing income tax and are now seeking to improve accounting for easy calculation. However, there are several requests: 1. If there are inconveniences in the implementation of the new tax, after research and proposals for revision are submitted, it is hoped that the government will adopt them as much as possible. 2. If disputes arise during implementation, it is hoped that the government will not harass merchants when investigating. 3. The audit committee was originally stipulated in the regulations, and it is hoped that it will be established as soon as possible. 4. It should be implemented uniformly for both Chinese and foreigners, but we should strive to implement it as an example. 5. It is hoped that the government will use the collected funds for domestic construction and foreign defense, without wasting a penny. ⑶ Qian Sunqing said that there is no question that the people support the new tax. However, in implementation, it is hoped that: 1. The habits of the people will be taken into account. 2. The penalties will be revised. 3. It will be implemented uniformly for both Chinese and foreigners. 4. Unfavorable tax revenues will be reduced in the future to lighten the burden on the people. There were also speeches by Lin Kanghou and others, which are omitted for brevity. The guests and hosts parted happily at about 7 o'clock.

### Third Day of the Income Tax Research Conference

Completed Discussions on Salaries, Remuneration, and Interest on Deposits; Accounting Issues to be Discussed This Afternoon

The Income Tax Research Conference convened by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its second group meeting at 10 AM yesterday and continued the plenary session at 2 PM to discuss the second category of salary and remuneration income and the third category of securities deposit interest income. Details are recorded below:

Group Meeting

At 10 AM, the group meeting was held, attended by Qian Sunqing, Chen Ziyi, Chen Weiwen, Wang Yonghai, Wang Jiean, Qian Xuchu, Kong Shushen, Xu Yongzuo, and Yan Esheng. Chairman Qian Sunqing resolved the following cases: (A) Regarding the parts submitted by the general meeting for discussion: ⑴ Bad debts, in addition to actual losses during the business period, should include reasonable forecasts of bad debt losses in accounts receivable at the time of settlement. Resolved: Please add an item "reasonable forecasts of bad debt losses" to Article 19 of the asset valuation method of the Ministry of Finance. ⑵ If a legal person invests in real estate without the purpose of making profits, can the income be deducted when calculating net profits? Resolved: Those concerned should handle it at their own discretion. ⑶ Current accounts of stores have deposits and debts, which are different from fixed deposits. It is requested to be exempt from interest income tax. Resolved: Request the Ministry of Finance to add the seven characters "and other industrial and commercial" under "branch stores" in Article 4 of the third category of collection instructions. ⑷ Proposed by the Silk and Satin Industry Association: Store accounting should still retain the cash basis system. Resolved: Request the Ministry of Finance to allow businesses that cannot settle profits and losses or pay in installments within an accounting year to settle according to the cash basis. (B) Regarding the second category of salary and remuneration: ⑴ Tax is levied on salaries starting from 30 yuan, which is too low. It should be changed to tax from 50 yuan. ⑵ The second category of tax rates is too progressive, with too few levels and too large differences between each level. ⑶ There are too few tax exemptions. It should be increased: (A) In addition to statutory savings funds, all kinds of mandatory savings funds should be tax-free. (B) Life insurance premiums should be tax-free. (C) Copyright royalties should be tax-free. The above four items should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for separate amendments and supplements.

Research Meeting

At 2 PM, the research meeting continued, attended by 153 representatives. Wang Jiean was the chairman, and Ye Zhizhong was the secretary. After the chairman reported the minutes of the group meeting, it was resolved that, except for the item on the cash basis, which should be re-submitted to the group meeting for research, all other items were passed. The following cases were then discussed: ⑴ Proposed by the Hardware Parts Industry Association: Article 5 of Chapter 2 Tax Rate of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations should reduce or exempt the minimum necessary living expenses when taxing salary and remuneration income. Resolved: This case has requested the Ministry of Finance to tax salary and remuneration starting from 50 yuan, which can be relieved. ⑵ Proposed by the Cotton Trading Industry Association: Suppose a firm has a net profit of 100,000 yuan at the end of the year, of which 20,000 yuan must be distributed to partners as remuneration. Should the net profit portion be taxed at 80,000 yuan? If the tax is paid according to 100,000 yuan, the 20,000 yuan distributed to the partners must still pay income tax according to the second category regulations of the Income Tax Regulations. Is this a double taxation? Resolved: Request the Ministry of Finance to amend Article 12, Section 2 of the first category of collection instructions and delete the nine characters "through managers and other employees." As for the receipt of the partner's personal share, the subject is different, and the tax should be paid according to the regulations. ⑶ Proposed by the Sauce Garden Industry Association: Piecework or per-piece wages cannot determine the average monthly or daily income, so how should the taxable amount be calculated? Resolved: Piecework wages are based on the piece as a unit, and one piece may not be made by one person. There are no regulations in the current regulations, so no tax needs to be paid. ⑷ Small tax amounts are carried to the tax collection agency every month, which requires travel expenses. Please ask the Ministry of Finance to change the procedure and allow them to be paid every six months. Resolved: Passed. ⑸ Proposed by the Timber Industry Association: Should the salary of a sole proprietor who also serves as a manager have a certain standard? Resolved: It should be determined by itself according to the actual situation. ⑹ Proposed by the representative of the Silk Edge Industry Association: Can the entertainment and communication expenses incurred by a sole proprietor who also serves as a manager for business needs be used as expenses? Resolved: If there is a bill, it can be used as an expense. ⑺ How should sole proprietorship stores that have always been responsible for expenses internally and cannot provide independent accounting be handled? Resolved: The store accounts and family accounts should be separated. ⑻ Proposed by the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce: Should the interest income on deposits in foreign banks be taxed uniformly? Resolved: Passed. ⑼ Proposed by the Hardware Industry Association: The interest income on deposits is taxed uniformly at 5%, which is unfair. It should be changed to a progressive system. Resolved: Submitted to the group meeting for research. ⑽ Please expand the scope of tax exemption for statutory savings funds and labor savings funds. Resolved: It has been requested that mandatory savings funds should be exempt from income tax. ⑾ Representative Chen Ziyi of the Bean and Rice Industry proposed to correct item 13 of yesterday's resolution to be: All kinds of industrial and commercial enterprises that should pay various income taxes that have the nature of withholding should be given one-fifth of the handling fee in accordance with the example of the silver and money industry to show fairness. Resolved: Passed. ⑿ The presidium proposed that this conference express its respect to accountant Xu Yongzuo for attending every day to answer questions and provide careful guidance. Resolved: Passed. It was decided that a public banquet for accountant Xu Yongzuo would be held at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road on the seventh floor at 12 noon on the 25th of this month, and souvenirs would be presented to express gratitude. Each group or company should pay a fee of 5 yuan, which must be paid when the next meeting is held. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. Moreover, the research conference will continue to be held this afternoon (24th) at 2 PM to discuss income tax and accounting issues.

### The Strike by Chinese Medicine Stores in the French Concession is Completely Resolved

Police Withdrawn Yesterday Morning and Electricity Restored in the Afternoon; Chinese Medicine Industry Association Announces Full Resumption of Business This Afternoon

The strike by Chinese medicine stores in the French Concession due to the French Municipal Council cutting off electricity and forcing the collection of new donations has lasted for nearly a week. All parties have been very concerned and have been conducting negotiations and providing assistance. After Secretary Geng of the Municipal Government and Qu Zhenhua and Dai Chunfeng of the Second Special District Citizens' Association made final consultations with the French Municipal Council the day before yesterday, the situation took a turn for the better. The Chinese Medicine Industry Association immediately convened an emergency meeting of Longshi colleagues that evening to agree to resume business after the French Municipal Council first restored electricity to the stores. A decision was also made regarding the payment of new donations (see yesterday's newspaper).

Negotiation Process

Since the Chinese medicine stores in the French Concession went on strike due to the French Municipal Council cutting off electricity and forcing the collection of new donations, it has been nearly a week. All parties have been very concerned and have been conducting negotiations and providing assistance. After Secretary Geng of the Municipal Government and Qu Zhenhua and Dai Chunfeng of the Second Special District Citizens' Association made final consultations with the French Municipal Council the day before yesterday, the situation took a turn for the better. The Chinese Medicine Industry Association immediately convened an emergency meeting of Longshi colleagues that evening to agree to resume business after the French Municipal Council first restored electricity to the stores. A decision was also made regarding the payment of new donations (see yesterday's newspaper).

Electricity Restored First

The French Municipal Council withdrew the police guarding the stores and obstacles yesterday morning. Starting at 2 PM in the afternoon, the Water and Electricity Company was ordered to restore electricity to all stores.

Notice of Resumption of Business

After receiving the report, the Chinese Medicine Industry Association immediately decided to notify all stores to resume business uniformly at noon today. The original text reads: "For the matter of notification, the electricity of all colleagues in the entire district has been restored by the French Municipal Council. All stores should resume business uniformly at 12 noon on the 24th. This is specially notified."

### Gan Jiehou Returned South Yesterday

Former Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi, Gan Jiehou, came from northern Guangdong, representing Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, and successively visited important figures in the central government and waited to meet Wang Jingwei. After the matter was completed, he boarded the French mail ship "Qin Laboder" at 8 AM yesterday and set off south to report to Li and Bai.

### Qian Xinzhi Discusses the Issue of Bank Employee Guarantees

Special Cash Guarantee Method is Both Legal and Reasonable and Suitable for National Conditions

Financial leader Qian Xinzhi said yesterday regarding the issue of reforming bank employee guarantees that the issue of bank employee guarantees is of great importance, as everyone knows. Recently, the Bankers Association researched the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" proposed by Wang Weizhou (Mr. Wang is currently the Secretary and Head of the Personnel Department of the Head Office of the Bank of Communications). After reading it carefully, he felt that it combined the spirit of guarantee, insurance, and savings. Employees no longer have the difficulty of seeking guarantees. The guarantee deposit exists in the bank, without the trouble of tracking and pressing for payment. Monthly on-the-job employees share a part of the responsibility, which can disperse the risk and has a mutual assistance effect. This can lead to the effect of joint supervision, which is both legal and reasonable and suitable for national conditions. Compared with the guarantor system, limited guarantees, and credit insurance, it is much better. However, when implementing it for banks with a smaller scope and fewer employees, it may still be necessary to make some modifications. It is reported that the chairman of the Bankers Association, Chen Guangfu, reported that the research results of the association believe that it is practical and feasible and decided to promote it. In the future, it will be promoted and implemented successively so that the guarantee system in our country can be established perfectly. I believe that the creation of a new system is nothing more than making it a fact in theory. However, to seek the expression of facts, it is especially important to have the spirit of reform, implement it resolutely, and strive for perfection in the process of implementation. The improvement of all undertakings is probably the same example. It is hoped that people in the financial industry will not only pay attention to this issue but also work hard on the implementation, so as to seek a new construction for the financial industry. I have also advised Wang Weiguo to collect various employee guarantee systems at home and abroad, add comments, and use the experience of the past two or three years to publish a special book for those who study this matter, so that the beneficiaries will not only be the banking industry.

### Shanghai Can Communicate with the UK and the US in the Near Future

Trial Calls with New York Resulted in Excellent Results

The China Press reported that in the near future, telephone users in Shanghai can pick up the handset and talk to friends in London or New York in a few minutes. At present, the trial of commercial communication with the UK and the US by wireless telephone every day is about to be completed. It is expected that at least one of the two places can be connected by the end of next month. This new business must be connected with the wireless machine of the Chinese government before it can be opened. Once the negotiations currently underway between the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company are successfully concluded, the American side can be connected and can use the Bell system to call any location in the United States through the Pacific Ocean. The traffic with London will be direct, taking the route through Asia and the European continent. In early February, another important wireless telephone business can be announced, that is, Shanghai is connected to Guangzhou and Hong Kong through Guangzhou. The trial work of this route has been successful. According to Shanghai Telephone Company officials, the trial of the American route has been completely satisfactory. Talks with New York have been held in recent days with excellent results. Someone in Shanghai was connected to New York in less than a minute on one occasion. After that, the conversation was clear and uninterrupted. Several trials have also been conducted by the Zhabei Chinese Telephone Bureau. This call requires adding a duplex machine to the existing mechanical equipment so that after the conversation is over, if there is anything unclear, this machine can be used to repeat it.

### Various Organizations Sent Three Telegrams Yesterday

Petitioning the Central Government to Wipe Out the Rebels and Admonishing the Northeastern Soldiers to Return to the Right Path

The joint meeting of various organizations in this city petitioned the Central Government yesterday to quickly use all its strength to wipe out the rebels to consolidate the foundation of unity and resist regret, and admonished the northeastern soldiers and Sun Weiru and others to return to the right path as soon as possible to preserve the vitality of the country. The details are recorded below:

Petitioning to Punish the Rebels

To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission: Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, all parties, from the court to the countryside, have been grieved and indignant and have unanimously given advice, hoping that they would turn around and repent. However, recent news has come that Yang Ni is not only without any sincerity of repentance but is also colluding with the Red Bandits to concentrate his rebellious troops and attempt to resist the Central Government. It can be seen that his ambition to betray the Party and harm the country has been clearly revealed. It seems that such a willful and unrepentant attitude should not be tolerated any longer. At a time when the national crisis is serious and the border troubles are tight, the rebel does not consider the difficulties of the time, colludes with the Red Bandits, shakes the foundation of the country, and raises paralysis enough to cause trouble. Tolerating it is suitable for condoning the treacherous. If Qingfu is not eliminated, Lu will not end. Suppressing the Red Bandits is by no means a civil war. We should quickly order the division and wipe out the bandit atmosphere. The country and the nation really depend on it. The public groups in this city are willing to lead 3.8 million people to pledge to be the government's backing. The telegraph is overwhelmed with resentment. The Joint Conference of Shanghai Public Groups kowtows.

Admonishing to Return to the Right Path

Admonishing the northeastern soldiers and Sun Weiru and others to return to the right path telegram says: (Titles omitted) Since Yang Ni Hucheng's Xi'an rebellion, offending the superiors and causing chaos, the whole country was shocked, and letters and telegrams were rushing to give bitter advice. The central government is also based on the spirit of cherishing national power, making long-term and broad tolerance. The rebel should have followed public opinion and repented strongly, but he stubbornly insisted on private wisdom and self-use, colluding with the Red Bandits to destroy unity. His dimness, cunning, and brutality have reached this point. Our people all have the determination to resist regret and resist the enemy and save the country, how can we allow him to betray the country and the Party, to reverse the heart of the world with one person, and to be the enemy of the whole country with his body. Success or failure, gain or loss, why wait for the turtles? Right and wrong, obedience and rebellion are obvious. How can all the generals not see it? It is said that good birds choose the origin to perch, and virtuous officials choose the master to serve. How can all the generals not know it? Modern soldiers are raised by the circle of the family and obey the orders of the government. Although the officials have changed, obedience to the government orders remains unchanged. Today, Yang Ni betrays the Party and the country and isolates himself from the people of the country. He should not accept the chaotic orders again and help the tyrant. Moreover, it is an evil habit of feudal soldiers to be disloyal to the country and loyal to a person's surname, which is not what the current soldiers should do. I hope my friends will identify the right and wrong, obedience and rebellion, and resolutely return to the right path and punish the rebels, then not only will you win the extraordinary merits of the upper reward, but also you will be recorded in history and fragrant for thousands of years. Those who are ignorant of the righteousness and willingly attach to the rebellion will not be tolerated by national laws and Party discipline, and the punishment will not be able to be regretted. I hope all the generals will plan well. I hereby submit my words, I hope you will consider and kowtow.

Telegrams to the Whole Country

All agencies, organizations, and newspapers in the country are informed that this meeting has just submitted to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission to quickly use all its strength to wipe out the rebels, and admonished the northeastern soldiers and Sun Weiru and others to return to the right path as soon as possible. The article says (see above). Please unanimously advocate punishing the treacherous and maintaining the foundation of the country. This is specially reported for your consideration. The Joint Conference of Shanghai Public Groups kowtows.

### Northeastern Compatriots Under Japanese Puppet Control

Those coming to Shanghai from the Northeast report being at risk of arrest at any time.

The "Zi Lin Bao" reports that according to people newly arrived in Shanghai from the Northeast, any Chinese residing in the northeastern provinces who frequently receive letters from mainland China are suspected by the puppet Manchurian authorities and are at risk of being arrested and interrogated at any time. Letters entering and leaving the region are now subject to strict inspection. Most Chinese are now advising their relatives and friends in mainland China not to send letters unless it is absolutely necessary to avoid suspicion by the puppet Manchurian inspectors. Chinese in Manchuria, whether rich or poor, are now filled with unease. Gentlemen and the wealthy, and those with some reputation, are often monitored by the authorities for no reason. Those who usually do not wish to associate with Japanese or puppet Manchurian officials are suspected of being reactionaries and are arrested. It is heard that from the beginning of February, the puppet Manchurian government will launch a major purge of so-called reactionary and ideologically impure elements. Anyone with the slightest suspicion of being reactionary, or even those who usually hold a cold attitude towards the puppet Manchuria, will be subject to strict monitoring and thorough investigation. The puppet Manchurian government has recently forcibly merged small villages into larger defensive units, calling this a "national defense plan." Any village that receives a notice to merge with another village and does not immediately comply will be burned to the ground without mercy. The newly merged villages are all built with solid defensive works, and villagers are forced to dig trenches. The expenses for the defensive works must be borne by the villagers. In the past, defensive structures were mostly built in strategic locations and on mountain ridges, but now they are spread across the plains, forming a large defensive network. Every eight miles, a watchtower and signal station are built. In addition to the telegraph network and long-distance telephone lines that have already been completed, underground telegraph and telephone lines are now being installed to cope with any sudden changes. To facilitate the transportation of large armies, the main roads that are considered important to "national defense" are all resurfaced with gravel and other hard materials.

### The Bank of Communications Held a Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday

Insufficient number of attendees, a provisional resolution was passed to increase capital.

The Bank of Communications held a temporary shareholders' meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the bank's conference room on the third floor of Number 7 on the Bund. There were 210 shareholders present, representing 17,783 voting rights and 21,727 shares. Chairman Du Yuesheng attended and reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the bank had been in operation for 41 years, but due to the failure of old shareholders to fully pay up their capital, business could not fully develop. Therefore, the board of directors convened today's shareholders' meeting to discuss methods of increasing capital. Subsequently, due to the insufficient number of shareholders present to meet the legal quorum, the proposals were treated as provisional resolutions: (1) The unpaid capital of 3.5 million yuan for all shares of the bank will be reduced because the old shareholders are unable to pay. (2) In order to develop business, the board of directors is authorized to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to allocate government shares. The board of directors will submit a request to increase the discount on old shares. (3) A second temporary shareholders' meeting will be convened within half a month to vote on today's (i.e., yesterday's) provisional resolutions.

### Records of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee

The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee at 97 Renji Road received a letter from the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association stating that the association has been establishing temporary winter shelters in South Shanghai every winter to accommodate poor and unemployed civilians, and they are dismissed separately when the weather warms up in the spring. Now that winter is approaching again, it should be held as usual. The expenses of the shelter rely entirely on fundraising. We have received donations from you in the past, benefiting the poor. This year, the market is even more depressed, there are more poor people, and it is more difficult to raise donations. Your enthusiastic relief efforts have always been admired. We still hope that you will generously donate to help with relief efforts. The merit is immeasurable, etc. Also received a letter from the Qingjiangpu Pu Hui Congee Factory stating that the factory has been subsidized by your committee over the years, benefiting disaster victims. The years have passed without us knowing. In the blink of an eye, the winter season has arrived again, and we plan to prepare for distribution immediately. This year, the harvests in various provinces are very good, but the Huaibei area is remote and has mostly low-lying land. This autumn, it first suffered from drought, followed by rain and fog. The harvest is not as good as in other places, and there are many people without land or jobs. The so-called barren land and poor people mean that every winter, even in years of good harvest, there are still many people eating congee at the factory. Therefore, we are writing to respectfully request that you continue to help with funds and clothing, etc., so that we can broadly save the hungry people. The merit is truly immeasurable, etc. Also received a letter from the Anhui Provincial Capital Disaster Children's Education and Shelter stating that the shelter has been accommodating disaster children for two years. Teaching and shelter are combined, and the scale is roughly complete, but there are no funds. We rely entirely on the support and assistance of various great philanthropists. All achievements and income, donations, and expenses are recorded in the report in the first anniversary publication. We hope to receive your attention. However, since the anniversary, because the disaster children have no homes to return to, if they are dismissed, they will inevitably still fill the ditches, which is far from the original intention of relief. The colleagues agreed to change it to an education and shelter, and reported to the government for approval to register. We have tried our best and continue to raise funds until now. We are exhausted. Thinking that our shelter has been maintained by your association in the past, we should receive relief in the future, so as to avoid 200 disaster children being displaced. Now, we specially recommend Chuan Jun Erkang and Rui Jun Xiaocen to come and explain everything in person, hoping that you will consider the good deeds of caring for children and complete them from beginning to end, and donate to save the urgent situation, etc. It is heard that the association has been providing assistance to the above associations every winter. Now that we have received the letter, we held another meeting yesterday and decided to allocate 4,000 yuan to the temporary shelter, 2,500 yuan to the Qingjiangpu Hui Congee Factory, and 1,000 yuan to the Anhui Disaster Children's Education and Shelter to assist and help the poor, etc.

### Smallpox Spreads in This City

507 patients last week, 20 deaths, affecting Zhuzhou

Since the outbreak of smallpox in this city, it has caused extreme concern in various ports in other cities, and Shanghai has been declared a smallpox-infected port, all of which have been reported in the newspapers. A Datong News Agency reporter recently learned from the Harbor Quarantine Station that smallpox in this city is spreading more and more, and the number of deaths has increased sharply. The details are recorded as follows:

Smallpox Spreads

A reporter learned from the Shanghai Harbor Quarantine Station that since the outbreak of smallpox in this city, it has not subsided slightly. Recently, it has spread more and more severely. According to the station's investigation, in the past week (i.e., the week before midnight on the 16th), the number of people infected with smallpox in Shanghai reached 57 (including 4 foreigners), and 20 people died of smallpox. The severity of the outbreak and the seriousness of the situation should not be ignored.

Spreads Throughout the City

It is also learned that the areas where smallpox patients were found last week included 28 people in the First Special District, with 16 deaths, 12 people in the Second Special District (no deaths), and 18 people in the city, with 4 deaths. According to the above-mentioned areas and their figures, the spread of smallpox in Shanghai is spreading throughout the city, which is worthy of attention.

Affects Hangzhou

Due to the proximity and convenient transportation between Shanghai and Hangzhou, smallpox in Hangzhou has also been affected. Two cases have been found last week. There is no news from other places yet. At the same time, passengers from Shanghai's outer ports will still be prohibited from landing if they have not been vaccinated against smallpox at the Shanghai Port Quarantine Station and issued a vaccination certificate. There are many difficulties and delays.

### This City Detains Drug Offenders and Executes Them by Shooting After Approval by the Military Commission

Smokers in various districts surrender especially enthusiastically. Concession authorities cooperate in arresting drug offenders.

The Municipal Police Department is actively carrying out the work of banning smoking and drugs in the urban area. The Concession authorities are also assisting in the investigation and arrest. If drug offenders are arrested in the urban area, they will be sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for approval by the Military Commission and then executed by shooting. Smokers have been surrendering to the valley district offices and requesting treatment for addiction in large numbers in recent days. The details are recorded as follows:

Detain Drug Offenders and Submit for Approval to be Executed by Shooting: According to Section Chief Dai Lizhen, the deadline for banning drugs ended at the end of the 25th year. If anyone is arrested for producing, selling, or consuming drugs in the urban area this year, the bureau will send them to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation. If the facts are verified and the case is tried according to law, the details of the case must be submitted to the Military Commission for approval before the execution by shooting. As for North China, due to the special situation and environment, the responsible authorities may submit it to the Jicha Political Affairs Committee for approval and then execute it by shooting on the spot.

Surrender Smokers Especially Enthusiastically: After the forced registration of smokers in this city ended at the end of last December, the police stations in various districts stepped up the investigation and arrest of unregistered smokers. At the same time, they implemented household guarantee certificates, which have been very effective. In order to give smokers in the city one last new opportunity, the Municipal Police Department still allows unregistered smokers to voluntarily quit. Therefore, smokers in various districts have been surrendering and applying for smoking cessation in large numbers in recent days. Now that the smoking cessation hospitals are trying to increase the number of beds, smokers can be accommodated as much as possible.

Concession Authorities Cooperate Seriously: A Datong News Agency reporter also learned from the Huazu Concession authorities that the Concession authorities have not negotiated and implemented the central government's strict ban on smoking and drugs in terms of administrative sovereignty, but they are seriously and unremittingly carrying out the work of cooperation in the investigation and arrest. Therefore, there are also a large number of smokers in the area who voluntarily apply for smoking cessation at the Municipal Police Department and the nearby districts.

### The Third Branch of the Higher Court Builds a New House

Annual rent of one yuan in national currency

Yang Peng of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, considering that the court's office is inconvenient to borrow private houses and that it costs the national treasury, is now planning to negotiate with the French authorities to rent the vacant land east of the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court. After a successful negotiation, a new court building will be built. The method has been repeatedly negotiated with the French Public Works Bureau and the landlord. The value of the rented land is one yuan per year in national currency, with a term of 50 years. The negotiation is now in progress and is expected to be completed soon. After this plan is negotiated, the president of the court plans to submit a request to the Ministry of Justice for the designated funds to be allocated for construction costs, in order to implement the construction as soon as possible and open a new court office.

### Zhang Yugao, a "Big Painted Face" Actor, Has a Nervous Breakdown and Cuts Three Men and Women With a Knife

Empty toilet seat on Li Wu's head. Zhou Zhou and others were injured and sent to the hospital.

Zhang Yugao, an actor, is 40 years old and from Tianjin. He specializes in playing the "Big Painted Face" and partners with the famous actor Xiao Yang Yuelou to perform at the Huangjin Grand Theater. He originally lived in Xiao Yang Yuelou's home at No. 12 Renchang Lane, Kaizi'er Road, French Concession. Zhang has a wife, and all the money he earns each month is managed by his wife. Unexpectedly, after Zhang's wife died, the money that was successively handed over for management

Was all gone

Even without the ability to handle the funeral, Zhang was stimulated by this. Later, friends and others, considering that Zhang had suffered the grief of losing his wife and that there were many inconveniences in his family, raised funds again to allow Zhang to remarry. Who knew that the person who entered the door was a scoundrel who soon ran away without a trace. Zhang was stimulated twice, causing a nervous breakdown. He often quarreled at home, so he stopped performing and stayed at home to recuperate. However,

Because of his mental disorder

Xiao Yang Yuelou and his family couldn't stand his noise. After friends accompanied Zhang to temporarily live in the Liyuan Guild Hall in Xima Bridge in the city, they were treating him. The guild hall also couldn't stand Zhang's noise, so Zhou Zhou (58 years old, from Changshu), an old woman living at No. 23 Dingning Lane, Ailaige Road, French Concession, introduced Zhang Yugao to rent the remaining stove shed at the home of Li Wu (60 years old), an old woman from Suzhou at No. 30 Dingning Lane, for a monthly rent of five yuan. He moved in on the 12th of this month and has been living peacefully until now. Who knew

At four o'clock yesterday morning

Zhang's nerves suddenly went haywire again. Because the door was latched from the outside (the sub-landlord was entrusted by the introducer, fearing that he would cause trouble outside, so he latched the door from the outside to prevent accidents), he couldn't open it, so he shouted loudly and made noise in the room. At that time, the sub-landlord Li Wu got up when she heard the noise and opened Zhang's door to comfort him nicely. Zhang

Became foolish

Not only did he ignore her, but he also put the empty toilet seat next to him on the head of the sub-landlord Li Wu. Wu took off the toilet seat and ran to shout for the introducer Zhou Zhou. Zhang had already followed out with a kitchen knife. Seeing the introducer Zhou Zhou walking in front and the sub-landlord Li Wu walking behind, Zhang immediately

Cut with a knife

Zhou Zhou's arms and then ran out of the lane. At that time, a rickshaw puller Tao Xingzhi (from Jiangbei, living at No. 56 Daxing Street outside Ximen) parked his rickshaw at the entrance of the lane. Zhang wanted Tao to pull the rickshaw to a certain place. Tao saw that Zhang was talking nonsense and ignored him and wanted to pull the rickshaw away. Zhang immediately reached out and grabbed Tao, cutting Tao's head with a knife, causing him to bleed. Zhang then let go and ran to the pancake shop at No. 96 opposite. The shop had just opened its door. Wang, a pancake baker from Shandong, was lighting the coal stove. Zhang cut Wang's right hand with a knife. After Wang was injured, he

Twisted Zhang

With one hand and had the fierce knife snatched by bystanders. He called the police to come and send Zhang to the police station. Detective Wu Wengang was dispatched to investigate. At the same time, Zhang Yugao was sent to the Tairaste Road Public Works Bureau Hospital, and the injured were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The case will be reviewed after they recover.

### Two More People Released in the Jingyun Building Robbery Case Yesterday

Lu Baozi and Han Xiaolong

Since the Liu Jingdetang robbery case at the Jingyun Building on Beijing Road on New Year's Eve last year, the chief patrol room in charge has been arresting the relevant criminals. So far, 22 people, including Wang Jinsheng and Chen Rongsheng, have been arrested, and three pistols and more than ten bullets have been seized. Among them, Xu Honglin and Lu Xiumei were found to be unrelated and have been submitted to the First Special District Court for approval to release them. The rest are being held for investigation, all of which have been reported in this newspaper. The patrol room investigated and found that Lu Baozi and Han Xiaolong, two of the criminals, were also not related. Therefore, the patrol room's lawyer Ru Bao-yi requested the Special First Court yesterday to stop the detention. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he immediately ordered that Lu Baozi and Han Xiaolong should be released immediately.

### Qi Xinsheng Denies Assassinating Xu Libing

Six Hundred Thirty Cash Can Kill a Person: It Wasn't Buying a Knife and Wine, But Seizing a Knife and Returning It

Qi Xinsheng, a worker at the Zhenye Sock Factory in Tanjiachiao, Zhabei, was dismissed after being reported by foreman Xu Libing for poor performance. Qi requested reinstatement from the factory, which was granted, but Xu refused. On December 1, 1936, Qi carried a

sharpened pear knife

and stabbed Xu Libing to death. The police arrested Qi and handed him over to the District Court Prosecutor, who filed a public prosecution. Xu's widow, Madame Xu Fan, also hired lawyer Xu Qinnan from her hometown to file a civil lawsuit, seeking 1,000 yuan in compensation for funeral expenses and consolation. Yesterday, Liu Bojun continued the interrogation. Madame Xu Fan testified that the deceased was her husband, and the family includes a 72-year-old mother, three sons, and a daughter. "With my husband murdered, the old and the young are left with nothing to live on!" She

burst into tears in court

and further stated that her husband, in his dying moments, told her sister, Qian Xu, that Qi Xinsheng was incited to kill by Hu Chengkui and Shen Shigen. Hu Chengkui is an accountant at the iron factory and is currently under investigation by the prosecutor's office. Qian Xu testified in court that her younger brother, Xu Libing, was stabbed once in the right abdomen and once in the right hand by Qi Xinsheng. Falling to the ground, he

cried to me,

"My intestines are severed, I cannot live. Please avenge me!" Qi, after committing the crime, told the police that he spent 330 cash to buy a knife and 300 cash to drink a cup of wine, saying that 630 cash can kill a person, boasting proudly. Therefore, she requested a severe punishment. Xu Liming, the deceased's brother, testified that he worked in the same factory as his brother. In March, his brother introduced a female worker, and Hu Chengkui, the factory's accountant, lured her to a hotel for illicit relations. When the female worker's family found out, his brother fired her, leading to a feud between Hu and his brother. Hu wanted to ruin his brother's business and promote Qi Xinsheng to foreman. Because his brother had worked at the factory for eleven years,

he was trusted by the manager

and was not dismissed. Qi Xinsheng had stopped working at the factory and later requested to return. His brother agreed to reinstate him on the 21st, but before the 21st, Qi Xinsheng stabbed him to death. He requested a thorough investigation. Witness Tang Jinhua testified that while working at the factory, Xu Libing and his sister Qian Xu were talking when he heard a cry for help. He went outside and saw Qi holding a knife, stabbing Xu once before running away. Xu chased after him, and Qi stabbed him again, causing him to fall to the ground. Questioned about this, the defendant Qi Xinsheng stated, "I never said anything about buying a knife and wine. It was actually seizing a knife and returning it. Please investigate." The official then adjourned the investigation for further questioning.

### A Man and a Woman Attempt Suicide by Poison

Yin Yunzhen in Critical Condition; Gao Huizhen Dies

Yin Yunzhen: Yin Yunzhen, a 41-year-old man from Changshu, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown with over fifty yuan in legal tender to purchase New Year's goods. He stayed in a certain hotel. Yesterday afternoon around 10 p.m., while out shopping, the legal tender he carried was stolen by a pickpocket. Extremely frustrated, he had thoughts of suicide. He used the few remaining coins in his pocket to buy a box of raw opium and swallowed it on the way to the Laiyuan Restaurant on Fourth Avenue for dinner. Suddenly, the poison took effect, and he collapsed to the ground, his face pale and groaning. The restaurant's waiter reported to Chinese Constable No. 499, who sent him to Renji Hospital in an ambulance. It is said that the poisoning was severe, and his life is in critical condition.

Gao Huizhen: Gao Huizhen, a 23-year-old young woman from Suzhou, lived at No. 90, Lane 80, Guangxi Road. Yesterday afternoon at 3:40 p.m., due to her husband wanting a divorce, she suddenly had suicidal thoughts and secretly took poison. Her family discovered it and reported it to the police station, which dispatched Investigator No. 342 to investigate. Gao Huizhen was sent to the hospital by car, but she had already died before arriving due to taking too much poison. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination.

Automobiles were provided to transport the guests, and all expenses were borne by the association without charging the newlyweds to show its promotion.

### Shanghai Gentleman Mo Zijing Has No Heirs, Frequent Lawsuits Over Inheritance Rights

Mo Benhou Requests Confirmation that Mo Runkun Has No Inheritance Rights; Mo Runkun Countersues that Mo Benyuan's Inheritance Is Invalid

The late Shanghai gentleman Mo Zijing had no children during his lifetime, only a daughter named Runzhu, an old maid who died before her father. Because of his love for his daughter, Mo Zijing adopted Shen Jinglin as his daughter's heir, renaming him Mo Benhou. After Mo Zijing himself passed away, Mo Benhou inherited the property as a grandson. However, Mo Zijing's cousin Mo Runkun, claiming to be the appropriate generation, sought to be adopted as an heir. The lawsuit has lasted for years, and mediation has been attempted by the surviving old gentlemen, but Mo Benhou hired lawyers Wang Bushang and Ling Qihong to sue in the District Court for confirmation that Mo Runkun has no inheritance rights. Mo Runkun hired lawyer Tang Hao to countersue for confirmation that Mo Benhou's inheritance is invalid and that he has no right to sue. Yesterday, Judge Cao Baozhen opened the court. Regarding the witnesses who have passed away, including Shanghai gentlemen Yao Zhirang, Xu Fenglin, Ye Liwen, and Hu Jusheng, they could not be present. Lawyer Wang stated the previous situation, and lawyer Yu Yuan testified that he represented Mo Zirun when the settlement was signed, while they had hired lawyer Yu Dianhua. Because Yu was in Songjiang, Lu Bohong gathered people at Puyutang for Mo's family matters and invited me to dinner. Most of the people present were Shanghai gentlemen. As for the lawyers, it was me, Qu Yue, and Yu Dianhua. Yao Zhirang announced that it was a matter of Mo Zijing's inheritance, not a legal issue, and asked the lawyers present not to speak. I wanted to speak, but Yao said that everyone was an old friend and would talk after dinner, but there was no further development. Then, witness Mo Benzhong stated that Mo Xilun was his grandfather and that his grandfather handled Mo Zijing's funeral arrangements. Witness Mo Boyang testified that he was of the same clan. After Mo Zijing's death, Mo Zhu signed a settlement contract. Mo Zhaoxiong, Mo Xiqin, Mo Xilin, Mo Zigang, Mo Jiaquan, and I were present, and each received 2,500 yuan, and would not ask about it afterward. Mo Benhou was adopted by Mo Zhu. At this point, the official stated that the plaintiff's lawyer would present the original handwriting and will of Mo Zijing in the next hearing. The case will still be attempted to be resolved through reconciliation out of court and will be adjourned for one month for further questioning.

### The Truth Behind the Arson at the Prosperous Clothing Company on Fuzhou Road Is Revealed

Wu Ziliang Lost Money and Planned; Goldfish Tanks Were Filled with Gasoline; Huang Changgen Admitted to Conspiring to Share the Profits

The Prosperous Clothing Company at No. 548 Fuzhou Road was opened by the Wu brothers, Wu Ziliang and Wu Songsen, from Suzhou, with a capital of 18,000 yuan. It has been in business for more than nine years and is one of the older clothing stores in the Fuzhou Road area. It had fire insurance of 50,000 yuan, with 15,000 yuan from Shenchang Foreign Company, 14,000 yuan each from British and Great Eastern Companies, and 7,000 yuan from Lulin Foreign Company. Recently, due to the sluggish market, business at the Prosperous Company has been slow, resulting in significant losses. This year alone, losses have amounted to over 10,000 yuan, making it difficult to maintain. The company's accountant, Zhang Kuibo from Zhejiang, met a friend named Lin Mapi at the Tianyunlou Amusement Park in June last year. They discussed the company's losses, and Lin suggested setting a fire to obtain a large amount of compensation. He introduced Huang Changgen from Zhenjiang to Zhang, saying that Huang was skilled in arson and had exceptional methods. Zhang was tempted, and he and Lin and Huang repeatedly discussed the matter at Tianyunlou and Tongyuchun Teahouse. However, due to manager Wu Ziliang's incomplete agreement, it was delayed until now. Zhang was determined to carry it out, so on the 13th of the month, he gave Huang 150 yuan to purchase items for arson. On the 17th and 19th, using the alias Zhang Dezhi, he booked Room 112 at the Juelu Hotel and invited Wu Ziliang to persuade him to agree to the arson plan. As a result of the discussion, Wu agreed and promised to give Huang a reward of 9% of the compensation for every 100 yuan. On the night of the 21st of the month, Huang brought over a dozen goldfish tanks filled with gasoline to the Prosperous Company. At 2:40 a.m., he poured gasoline on the wool and reed mats and set them on fire. The fire quickly became fierce. The fire department received the report and immediately dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the fire, which was quickly put out, fortunately without spreading to neighboring houses. Afterward, the Old Zhabei Police Station dispatched Chinese Detective Lu Gengsheng, Investigator Feng Xiushan, and Western Detective Mike Fei to investigate. They discovered that the fire at the company was indeed arson and began to make arrests. Zhang Kuibo was arrested first. Based on Zhang's confession, Huang Changgen and Wu Ziliang were also arrested. Because Zhang and Huang's confessions involved Wu Songsen and insurance broker Chen Jianian from Ningbo, they were also arrested. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. After the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case, he requested permission to detain the defendants for further investigation. Judge Qian Hongye interrogated each defendant separately. Zhang Kuibo, Wu Ziliang, and Huang Changgen all confessed to conspiring to commit arson for compensation. Wu Songsen claimed that although Zhang Kuibo invited him to the Juelu Hotel on the 19th of the month, he left after taking a bath and did not meet Huang Changgen or participate in the arson conspiracy. Chen Jianian stated that the company's insurance with Great Eastern was handled by his relative, surnamed Shen. Because Shen suffered from paralysis, he handled the matter on his behalf. After the Prosperous fire, he went to investigate due to his professional duties and was arrested, but he knew nothing about their arson. Judge Qian reviewed the confessions and ordered Zhang Kuibo, Wu Ziliang, and Huang Changgen to be detained for one week. Wu Songsen was released on bail of 1,000 yuan, and Chen Jianian was released on bail of 200 yuan.

### The Whereabouts of Foreigners Who Left Shaanxi Arriving in Shanghai

Italian Priest Still Detained

North China Daily News reports that another group of foreigners, including six Italians, one Spaniard, and one Englishman, flew from Xi'an on an Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane on Thursday (21st). After departing at 11:10 a.m., they arrived in Nanjing at 5:45 p.m. on the same day. The 75 foreigners who arrived in Shanghai from Xi'an on Thursday morning are now residing in various places in Shanghai. Some of them are preparing to return to their home countries, while others will stay in Shanghai to wait for the situation in Xi'an to stabilize before returning there. The leader, Mr. Hill, is currently at the New Asia Hotel and plans to depart for Suiyuan after the week because his family is currently staying there. Mr. Hill participated in the Gobi Desert archaeological team from 1933 to 1935 and is accustomed to hard work. The foreigners' departure from Xi'an was due to his efforts. The foreigners who arrived in Shanghai on Thursday include citizens of England, the United States, Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.

The Continental Times reports that yesterday (22nd), the Italian Embassy in Shanghai received news that Father Sileni, an Italian priest stationed in Dali (100 kilometers northeast of Xi'an), Shaanxi Province, was detained by the Communists in Weinan. Embassy officials believe that the priest has not been harmed by the Red Bandits and is only being prevented from continuing his travels, being detained in a village near Weinan. The telegram was sent by the Italian Church in Shaanxi Province and also stated that the buildings of the Italian Church in Xi'an have been occupied by the rebel soldiers of Yang Hucheng's troops. A small group of Catholic priests remaining in Xi'an have not been disturbed. The buildings of the Italian Church in Sanyuan have been occupied by the Red Bandits. There is also an Italian Church in Tianli, which is currently quiet. It is also said that 17 Italian missionaries have left Xi'an by long-distance bus and plane for Luoyang. The Italian priests going to Beiping will be received by the head of the Italian Embassy there. Yesterday, churches and consular personnel in Shanghai were doing their best to find out the whereabouts of the eight missionaries who took the Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane to Luoyang on Thursday. Among them were six Italians, one Englishman, and one Spaniard. It was initially reported that the group had flown to Nanjing, but yesterday afternoon it was learned that they had disembarked in Luoyang. It is now believed that the Italians have gone to Beiping, and the other two may have taken the train to Shanghai (according to the North China Daily News, they arrived in Nanjing on Thursday afternoon). It was also learned last night that the only English missionary remaining in Xi'an has also left by long-distance bus and may arrive in Shanghai by train today.

### Japanese Marine Corps Marched on Various Roads Yesterday

Yesterday morning at approximately 11:00 a.m., the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai held a grand parade, passing through border areas, including Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and North Sichuan Road, and the Caojiadu area of ​​Western Shanghai. The procession was headed by a Japanese military motorcycle team, followed by a truck with a Rising Sun flag erected on it, guarded by Japanese soldiers holding guns on all sides. Behind it were 14 trucks filled with fully armed Japanese soldiers. Finally, there were many motorcycles and several military officer cars. At the same time, a large team of Japanese Marine Corps, led by many Japanese military officers, paraded along Nanjing Road, the Bund, and North Sichuan Road.

### Another Box with a Corpse Was Found in Lane 608, Yuyuan Road Yesterday

Stone Steps Dug Up to Widen Car Access; Female Corpse Dismembered and Buried for Approximately Two to Three Months

A case of a female corpse in a box was discovered yesterday afternoon inside Lane 608, Yuyuan Road, at No. 239 Beijing Road, the China Reclamation Bank real estate. The discovery was due to the Tan family at No. 20 in the lane requesting the bank's real estate department to slightly widen the entrance and exit of the garage behind the house to allow cars to enter and exit. With the permission of the real estate department, at around 1:00 p.m. yesterday, artisans Yang Yukang, Tang Hongcai, and Wang Lijiang were assigned to move the bamboo fence in front of the empty house No. 40 three feet inward. Unexpectedly, after removing a few feet of the bamboo fence and turning over the cement stone steps about seven or eight inches down, the artisans suddenly saw a wooden box buried underground. At the same time, a stench rushed out, making people nauseous. The three artisans knew something was wrong and immediately stopped working and reported to the real estate department. At around 3:00 p.m., Zhang Yayong of the real estate department reported the case to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and assigned Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene for investigation. It was confirmed that there was indeed a wooden box, so the artisans were instructed to dig it out. It was seen that the surroundings of the box and the ground were covered with lime. The wooden box was about 31 or 32 inches long and about 18 or 19 inches wide. When the lid of the box was forcibly opened, there was a dismembered corpse, already rotten, with blurred and indistinguishable features. The Chinese and Western detectives reported the situation to the police station by telegram and summoned an ambulance to transfer the wooden box to the coroner's office for examination. It was learned that the corpse was of a Chinese woman, about five feet two inches tall, fully developed, with small feet and complete teeth. She was wearing a white cloth shirt, a blue cloth vest, dark gray cloth pants, white socks, and a gray wide elastic band. Only the neck seemed to have been constricted with a rope. Judging from the degree of decomposition, the corpse had been buried underground for two or three months. She seemed to be a maid before her death. The identity of the murderer and the reason for the murder are currently under investigation. It was found that the house No. 40 was previously rented by W.C. Foster, a British employee of the Yizhong Tobacco Company at No. 175 Suzhou Road, for about five or six years. However, Foster resigned and returned to his country on May 9th last year. The house was vacated long ago, and no one has inquired about it until now, so it has been empty for eight months. The origin of the corpse is very puzzling, and it is possible that the corpse was moved after the fact.

### Mail on the Old Shuchong Steamer Disaster Not Damaged

Shanghai Post Office News: As for the old Shuchong steamer recently having an accident at Qingtan, the newspapers have already reported it. It has now been confirmed that all the mail carried by the steamer is safe.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (8)

Q: ㊀ Newspapers, magazines, and other similar publications issued in various places are mostly printed on the cover with phrases such as "Registered by the China Post as an Ordinary Newspaper," or "Registered by the China Post as a Voucher Newspaper," or "Registered by the China Post as a Bulk Newspaper." I wonder what these mean. If it is not indicated, will the post office not treat it as a newspaper for mailing? ㊁ What are the differences between Ordinary Newspapers, Voucher Newspapers, and Bulk Newspapers? Is the applicant free to choose when registering, or are there any specific regulations? ㊂ Suppose there is a newspaper published once every Sunday. Each time, 440 copies are sent to various places in China, and 50 copies are sent to Japan, totaling 490 copies. Each copy weighs 10 centimeters. Can it be mailed as a Class One newspaper?

A: ㊀ According to Article 1 of the Publication Law, newspapers or magazines that meet the following conditions: 1. Published under a fixed name in a fixed location; 2. Numbered sequentially and issued regularly and continuously; 3. Not bound into volumes using leather, cloth, wood boards, or other durable materials; 4. Registered with the Ministry of Interior (except those exempted by law),

can be registered with the postal administration to which the place of publication belongs as Class One (i.e., Ordinary Newspapers, also known as Common Newspapers), Class Two (i.e., Voucher), or Class Three (i.e., Bulk) newspapers, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 159 to 174 of the Postal Regulations. After registration, it should be indicated on the cover of each newspaper or magazine for identification. If not registered, the post office can only accept it as printed matter. ㊁ Regarding Class One, Two, and Three newspapers, each has its own regulations. Newspapers or magazines mailed sporadically by the public or newspaper offices are Class One. Newspapers stipulated in Article 1, Paragraph 2, Item 1 of the Publication Law, mailed by the publisher at the post office in the place of publication, with each mailing consisting of 500 copies or more, and each copy weighing 10 centimeters or more, are Class Two. Newspapers stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Publication Law, published in Chinese daily or every other day, and mailed by the publisher in the place of publication to the newspaper's managers in other places within 24 hours after publication, bundled according to the place of delivery, with each bundle containing at least 50 copies, to be collected by the respective managers upon arrival, are Class Three. Therefore, when newspapers apply for registration, they must consider whether their own conditions meet the requirements of which category, and register according to that category, not arbitrarily choose. The different rates for each type of newspaper are detailed in the various postage rate tables. ㊂ It should be mailed as Class One, not as Class Two. The reasons are as follows: 1. Newspapers stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Publication Law refer to those published daily or at intervals of no more than six days. The current publication is once a week, exceeding the prescribed time limit. 2. Although each copy weighs 10 centimeters, the number of copies mailed each time is less than 500, which does not meet the number of copies stipulated for Class Two.

### Frontline Soldiers Need Shirts

### Tong Yi Creditors' Meeting Adjourned Again Yesterday Due to Lack of Quorum

Since Tong Yi Trust Company declared bankruptcy last year, it has convened several creditors' meetings. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the court convened the fourth creditors' meeting of the company's banking department. Only about 50 to 60 people attended. Judge Jiang Gongliang from the civil court and bankruptcy administrator Li Ding, a certified public accountant, took the stage to report that the amount of debt represented by the attendees was only 270,000 yuan, which was less than half of the legal quorum. Subsequently, various creditors and representatives, lawyers Dong Yu, Le Junwei, Zhang Yifan, etc., expressed their opinions one after another. Most agreed with the rehabilitation plan proposed by mediators Du Yuesheng, Chu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, etc. However, given the imminent Lunar New Year, creditors were in dire need of funds and hoped that the authorities would consult with the mediators to find a flexible solution within possible limits before the creditors' meeting passed the plan, allowing for a partial advance payment of cash before the New Year to provide relief. The presidium explained that this meeting was still adjourned due to lack of quorum and would be reported to the court for handling.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern: Yesterday, I saw the news about the robbery at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory in your newspaper's local news column. Here is an excerpt from the report: "The day before yesterday (i.e., January 20th), at approximately 7:00 AM, Detective Zhu continued to apprehend three accomplices in the case inside the Shenxin No. 9 Factory at 140 Macau Road: Li Yunzhang from Tianjin, Yang Yaozhong from Chongming, and Zhang Ronghua from Anhui, etc. (omitted below)." The passage stated "Li is the watchman of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, and Yang Yaozhong is the warehouse keeper inside the factory, and Zhang is a worker, and they are all suspected of being involved in the robbery (omitted below)." Regarding the suspect Yang Yaozhong apprehended by the police, he is a stoker in the factory's furnace room, not a warehouse keeper inside the factory. Moreover, there is no such person as Yang Yaozhong among the clerks in the factory's warehouse section. The report is inconsistent with the facts. It must be a mistake in the pronunciation of "stoker" and "warehouse keeper." I am writing to request your newspaper to correct it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Shenxin Textile No. 9 Factory, Shanghai, January 23rd.

Dear Editor: On the 19th of this month, I hosted a reception for the members of the Guangxi Domestic Inspection Delegation on the eighth floor of Huaan Cooperative Insurance Company, where I work, due to my past association with them. Regarding the news published in your newspaper on the 20th, the statement that I am the manager is an error. I am writing to request that you correct it accordingly. Sincerely, Pang Tianjue, January 23rd.

Shen Bao Children's Special Issue

### The Lesson of the Snail

— De Lin

Little friends, in your usual studies at school, whether it's composition, arithmetic, calligraphy, or other subjects, you are often reprimanded by your teachers for poor performance. But don't think of this as a great humiliation and become discouraged. You just need to study each subject diligently. When you encounter difficult problems or unclear points in your textbooks, you can try to identify them and ask your teachers for detailed guidance, and then carefully remember them. If you can do this earnestly, then your knowledge and learning can naturally accumulate and become profound. If you don't believe me, I can give you an example now.

That is the snail on the wall. Isn't it slow when it moves upward? But it winds its way up, without being impatient, enduring patiently. However, its speed is unexpectedly very fast. Therefore, little friends, don't feel that you are not making any progress in your efforts to study. Now, looking at the events of the snail crawling on the wall, this can serve as your lesson and a good example.

### A Bitter Tear of a Primary School Student in Eastern Hebei

— Hua Ming

I received a family letter a few days ago that made me feel infinitely sad. The cruel order to change textbooks in Eastern Hebei schools has been implemented. What is most distressing is that the policy of disguised book burning has also been used. All textbooks that primary school students have read in the past have been collected, and whether they are burned or not is not necessary to ask.

I know that Eastern Hebei is no longer a place for children to study. But my hometown is there—Tangshan, so I have to let my younger brother suffer temporarily. Moreover, he will graduate from a certain high school this summer and transfer to another place (Tianjin or Beiping). In this unavoidable situation, I often write to him, telling him to study diligently and not to worry about anything else.

The day before yesterday, he sent me a letter. Before I finished reading it, my tears flowed involuntarily. My sadness was partly for the future of China and partly for the suffering of my younger brother. Here is what he wrote:

"Brother, you have repeatedly written to me, instructing me to study hard, and I am very obedient. But now I can't study even if I want to. Because my language, nature, and social studies textbooks for the fifth, fourth, and sixth grades have been taken away. Now I only have the fifth-grade language textbook they gave me, which is full of this and that, and those things. Reading it not only makes people angry, but also does not help my further studies at all. Brother, how can I pass the exam in the future? Please discuss it with sister-in-law quickly and let me come to Shanghai. Our hometown is really unlivable. The most terrible thing is those so-called advisors who often come to visit our school. When our teachers see them coming, their faces turn as black as coal, and their speech is poor, full of support...friendship...it's really ear-splitting to hear. So once, one of our classmates got angry and stood up to argue with the teacher. I don't know why that advisor slapped him twice in the face right away. We were simply furious. Brother, do you think we can still study this?..." When he wrote this, his letter was full of tears. I am his brother, how can I not sympathize?

Eastern Hebei is still in Chinese hands, and it is already like this. What will it be like in the future?

A thirteen-year-old child can send me such a letter, which is quite thoughtful! So I copied it down to reveal the tragic situation in Eastern Hebei now!

### The Mystery of the Intermediate Badge

Reply to Zheng Wenying from Luoyang

Wenying, my brother:

Your willingness to go a step further and study Boy Scout lessons shows a learning attitude that is an essential element of success in your career!

Most Boy Scouts understand the meaning of the intermediate badge. They only know that the intermediate badge symbolizes a smiling face, and they only know the meaning of doing good and combining "Wisdom, Courage, and Benevolence," but they have not thought about the following three questions like you have:

㊀ Why does the intermediate badge have a reef knot?

㊁ Why is the reef knot connected to the badge that symbolizes a smiling face?

㊂ What is the relationship between the three words "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage" and the reef knot below?

That's right, your question is very good, but these principles cannot be answered in the textbook. However, we can understand it using common sense.

To answer the first question, you must first remember the reef knot on your own neckerchief. The knot on the neckerchief must be tied every day when you wear the uniform for the first time. It will remind you to do good and encourage you to do good. But when you graduate to the intermediate level, your work will increase, and your responsibility to do good will also increase. At the same time, you must also be an example for junior Boy Scouts. Therefore, in addition to the reef knot on the neckerchief, you must also wear a badge with a reef knot, which means that you have an additional reef knot on your body, telling you that your responsibility is heavier.

To answer the second question, you will certainly think of our eighth law, which tells us to always wear a smile, but how can we always be happy? The only way is to help others! Because doing good is the source of happiness, Baden-Powell has told us this.

To answer the third question, the best thing to do is to do good. But we must also have the determination to do good. Please turn to the first issue of the monthly magazine published by the General Association. Zheng Yizhang of our company has a theory of doing good in there, and one paragraph says:

"Before doing good, we must first have adequate preparation, and we must also have the ability to judge good and evil in an emergency. This is the application of wisdom. But if we only have the wisdom to judge right and wrong and the strength to do good without a benevolent heart, we will not go further and try to use our own intelligence and benevolence to actively help mankind and protect living beings; otherwise, not doing what is right would be a lack of courage."

In this way, we can understand that to do good, we must give full play to the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. To be a young person of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, we should also fulfill our promise to help others!

We admire your attitude of seeking knowledge and hope that you will often correspond with us. Best wishes for progress!

China Boy Scout Mutual Aid Society respectfully replies

### Writing Before the Fifth Anniversary of "January 28th"

— Da Haizi (Big Kid)

Dear little friends. I think you can't have forgotten this time five years ago, when a very prosperous Shanghai, considered the national industrial and commercial hub, was nearly completely destroyed by the rampant fighting. Although our soldiers fought bravely against the enemy at the risk of their lives, inflicting heavy blows on them, we ultimately suffered a great loss. Now, although the time that has passed since that cruel scene cannot be said to be long, it cannot be considered short either. But if we happily walk to Zhabei or Hongkou for a tour, those memories that can never be erased will float to the surface of our minds. Everywhere there are broken walls, a desolate scene, only increasing the sorrow of the visitors. Time accompanied all the melancholy, all the happiness, all the sorrow, and all the excitement that passed. At the same time, it also took away people's memories: those painful impressions gradually began to fade in people's hearts. One anniversary, two anniversaries, three anniversaries, four anniversaries, five anniversaries, ...even ten anniversaries. I believe that the days of blood commemoration will also slip away like time. From posting slogans, shouting slogans, publishing special issues, holding meetings, giving speeches...and, and to silence—eternal silence.

Now, it has been more than five full years since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, but for five years not only has the lost territory not been recovered, and national humiliation not been avenged, but the severity of the national crisis is even worse than in the past. However, fortunately, our country has now been unified, and it is time to settle internal affairs and resist foreign aggression. We firmly believe that the officials in charge of our government will have meticulous and comprehensive strategies for saving the country and promoting a plan for its revitalization.

The anniversary of January 28th has arrived for the fifth time. Although today is not January 28th, I would like to say a few earnest words before this anniversary. Because this annual commemoration must be held, we must understand the significance of this commemoration. At the same time, we should also earnestly take on the responsibility of saving and loving the country. I hope that everyone will work together with one heart to recover all the lost territory, wash away all national humiliations, and turn the national crisis into national prosperity.

Shanghai is a great metropolis of material civilization, but we must remember what Shanghai was like five years ago and what Shanghai is like five years after. If the January 28th Incident had not had our loyal and brave soldiers to resist, what would Shanghai look like today?

Dear little friends, now is a world where the strong eat the weak. If we want to preserve our motherland of five thousand years, and if our nation wants to survive in the future world, then we must all rise up and unite sincerely!

Remember! Walk on the bloodstains of the martyrs!

### Justice (1)

— Qing

In the entire history of chivalry around the world, there are often admirable and moving deeds. Among them, those that arise naturally and are most touching are the actions of naval captains. They practically have a fixed tradition: if any accident occurs at sea, whether it be a fire or running aground, the captain must ensure that everyone on board leaves before leaving himself. In this critical moment of life and death, he completely disregards his own life. Many brave and righteous individuals have sacrificed their lives in this way, embracing death as if returning home. This spirit of righteousness and valor will forever exist in the universe, eternally immortal.

The coastal area of Newfoundland is a very dangerous place, because hot water flows through the sea channels, often causing dense fog to rise from the water's surface. This hot current originates from the equator and mixes with the cold currents of the Arctic, creating this evaporating atmosphere. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that day and night become indistinguishable, and nothing beyond an arm's length can be seen clearly. However, when viewed from outside the fog, it resembles a vast expanse of rocky mountains covered in glistening white snow.

On the morning of June 20, 1822, amidst such a terrifying fog, a brigantine sailing ship named the "Drake" suddenly struck a reef. The ship immediately tilted to one side, and waves immediately rushed onto the deck. Captain Begg ordered the sailors to quickly cut away the masts and rigging, hoping to reduce the ship's weight and restore it to its original position, but it was all in vain. One lifeboat had already been swept away by the waves, and another capsized as soon as it was launched. In the end, only the smallest boat, specifically for the captain's use, remained. The sailing ship was about to break apart and sink. The sailors' only hope was to reach a small reef, the tip of which could be seen rising from the sea, albeit vaguely through the fog. Its size could not be accurately determined, but hopefully it was not too large. One of the sailors, named Leonard, grabbed a rope and jumped into the sea, but the swift current was too strong and pushed him in the opposite direction. Everyone quickly pulled him back onto the ship. Then, another crew member named Donner volunteered to go ahead in the last small lifeboat, with a rope securely tied around his body. The sailors cheered as the brave crew member set off on his dangerous journey, all holding onto the rope on the ship, afraid to let go, as wave after wave pounded against the ship, threatening to shatter it to pieces. They earnestly watched Donner row forward, just a few feet away from the reef. In a flash, a huge wave swept in, lifting the small boat high into the air, then crashing it down onto the reef, shattering it into pieces. Fortunately, Donner did not lose his life; he still held tightly to the rope and climbed onto the rock.

"When the birds are gone, the good bow is stored away."

I'm afraid that you:

In the end,

Will be chopped and diced for the pot.

### Gargling and Brushing Teeth

— (Cheng Ming)

Children: You must gargle and brush your teeth every morning and after meals. These two health-promoting practices should never be overlooked or forgotten! Because gargling and brushing not only make your mouth feel fresh and your teeth clean, but they also prevent tooth diseases, ensuring that you can chew food easily and not interfere with your stomach and intestines' digestion. Therefore, we should pay special attention to oral hygiene and practice regular gargling and brushing.

The main components of teeth are calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. Calcium phosphate dissolves easily when exposed to acidic substances. Therefore, food residue left in the mouth during meals can easily turn into foul-smelling acidic substances, which are the teeth's greatest enemy. If something goes wrong with the teeth, it will hinder chewing and cause problems with the stomach and intestines' digestion.

### The Crisis of China's National Industry

— Wei Li

In recent years, Chinese industry has consistently been in a state of decline and bankruptcy. Due to the impact of the global economic panic, the brutal offensive of international capitalist imperialism, and the prevalence of natural and man-made disasters, the fragile foundation of national industry established during the European War has suffered exceptional damage and upheaval.

In the most recent period, we have continuously witnessed the closure and auction of Chinese merchant factories, and incidents of work stoppages and wage cuts have been endless. Conversely, imperialism has been expanding its power within China, inflicting a significant blow upon us.

To be convinced, we can examine several important national industries at the current stage.

First, let's take the cotton yarn industry, the most important in our national industry. We know that the cotton yarn industry is the center of our national industry, and it can also be said to be the most important sector of Chinese industry. However, this sector is currently in a state of extreme decline. Originally, the yarn mills in China were controlled by the forces of China, Britain, and Japan. According to a survey from the previous year, there were 96 yarn mills with Chinese capital, 44 with Japanese capital, and 4 with British capital. In terms of spindles, China accounted for 57%, Japan for 39%, and Britain for 4%. However, in the past year, Chinese yarn mills have closed down in large numbers. According to the "Zhonghua Daily" on August 16th, as of that time, the famous yarn mills that had closed nationwide included 8 in Shanghai, 4 in Tianjin, 4 in Wuxi and Nantong combined, and 1 each in Jinan, Qingdao, and Hankou, totaling as many as 19. In addition, work stoppages, wage cuts, reorganizations, and auctions have become common occurrences. According to the "Shen Bao Weekly," of the more than 2.7 million spindles nationwide, 31.5% were idle, 12.4% had already implemented wage cuts, and 1% was about to implement wage cuts.

At the same time, four of the six major yarn mills in North China have been acquired by the Japanese, and there are rumors that the remaining two will also be acquired. Conversely, at this time, the Japanese are expanding their factories in China with a large amount of capital. In Tianjin, the Japanese have added 800,000 spindles, and they are also expanding in Qingdao and Shanghai. Furthermore, a new factory has been established in Tongzhou. In the future, the number of Japanese spindles will increase to around 4 million, while our number of spindles will still be just over 2.7 million. Comparing the two, this is something to be very concerned about.

Let's turn to the silk mills. We know that the silk reeling industry is one of China's most important industries, but in recent years, it has almost completely collapsed. Because of the dual pressures of overseas markets and raw materials, its operations have been intermittent. In the first half of last year, due to the abundant harvest of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the silk mills all resumed operations one after another. However, the autumn cocoon harvest was exceptionally poor, and coupled with the hoarding of large cocoon merchants, there was a great shortage of raw materials. Since the beginning of November, a total of more than 30 factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have been shut down, and the remaining cocoons can only last until the end of the year. Before the spring cocoons come on the market, the factories will be unable to operate.

In addition, the large-scale smuggling of rayon and the dumping competition of others in overseas markets have further plunged China's silk industry into hardship.

Besides cotton yarn and silk reeling, the flour industry should be an important national industry in China, but this industrial sector is also very depressed. Recently, the market price of flour has risen sharply, and last year's wheat harvest in China was also abundant. It would seem that the flour industry could develop greatly, but in reality, this is far from the truth. In recent years, the most difficult problem for China's flour industry has been the issue of raw materials. Often, due to a lack of raw materials or a soaring price of foreign wheat, operations have been greatly affected. Last year's wheat harvest in China was indeed abundant. According to estimates from the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the national wheat production increased by 49,806,400,000 "shi dan" compared to the previous year, and the barley harvest was 17,048,200,000 "shi dan," an increase of 8% compared to the previous year. Although this number is still not enough to supply the needs of domestic flour mills, it is much better than the previous two years. However, we still cannot enjoy this abundant harvest. Those who enjoy this abundant harvest are our friendly nations. Due to the large-scale purchase of grain by friendly nations in various parts of North China, there is a shortage of raw materials, and prices have also soared. As a result, factories have had to reduce operations in succession. "Factories such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Yuxing are all in a state of intermittent operation with reduced work hours. In September of last year, Shanghai factories had already reduced the number of cars by 30%, and in October, they reduced it by 40%. Subsequently, there were many factories that suspended operations. As a result, the flour industry is still fraught with crises.

## Page 20

In addition, industries such as the cigarette industry, the cement industry, the match industry, and the alcohol industry, although they have made some progress compared to the past, and have achieved considerable results in an absolute sense, they still need to be re-examined in a relative sense.

The national industry, which struggled out with great difficulty during the European War, is still in an extremely difficult position. Although we have only cited cotton yarn, silk reeling, and flour as examples, these three sectors can represent our national industry.

Why has our national industry suffered such a crisis? I believe that the main reasons are nothing more than the following:

First, the loss of the northeastern provinces and the control of North China by others have greatly affected the vast market for our national industry. Before the September 18th Incident, the northeastern provinces were an important market for our industrial products, but now they cannot be utilized.

Second, the invasion of international capitalist imperialism, especially the smuggling by friendly nations, has dealt a heavy blow to our industry. According to customs estimates, in the five months from January to May of last year, the smuggling of rayon, cigarette paper, and sugar alone amounted to no less than 305 million gold units. The customs duty loss in April alone reached 8 million yuan. These smuggled goods are flooding everywhere like a flood, and they will certainly cause losses to China's industry.

Third, our national industry is not rationalized enough at present. Its organization, the supply of raw materials, and the coordination of production and sales all lack an overall plan, so it is inevitably affected.

### Aurora Borealis

— Yan Xiang

People living in cities rarely notice the night scenery of nature, because they have been dazzled by the colorful lights of street lamps and trademarks. But those who live in the countryside can appreciate this unparalleled beautiful night scene. If you go to the far north of Russia, the coast of Norway, or certain parts of Canada, you can discover many never-before-seen splendors. These splendors are called "Aurora Borealis." Naturally, the South and North Poles also have "Aurora Australis," but because there is little land in the South Pole and no one has observed it, we will only talk about the Aurora Borealis here.

The aurora borealis can be seen in places closer to the Earth's magnetic axis, and the Earth's magnetic axis intersects the Earth's surface at the North Magnetic Pole. This North Magnetic Pole is located on Somerset Island in Canada, so that island is the most suitable place to view the aurora borealis.

There are mainly three shapes of the aurora borealis: arc-shaped, curtain-shaped, and long, streamlined-shaped. Its colors are usually tender green and tender yellow, but sometimes they are mixed with a little red and purple, which is very beautiful. When the aurora first appears, it is a serene and bright arch, with the top slightly deviating a few degrees to the west of true north. In an instant, the light radiates in all directions, as bright as a searchlight. This light continues to evolve and trembles and flickers non-stop. The local natives even believe that this is the light of their ancestors' souls. Sometimes the aurora stands upright like a curtain, and the folds of the curtain constantly change shape. This is indeed a fascinating spectacle.

The height of the aurora borealis, according to Stoermer's measurements in Norway, is 160 miles above the ground. Sometimes the top of the "streamlined aurora" can be as high as 250 miles above the surface, and we believe that the bottom of the aurora must be at least 40 miles above the ground. The height of the top of the aurora has been recorded as high as 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles).

Several people who have measured the aurora, including some, have said that they have personally heard the aurora make sounds that are unusually clear. Some say that the sound is like the rustling of silk banners fluttering in the wind, some say that the sound is like the scraping sound of a sharp knife rapidly swirling through the air, and others say that the sound is like the whistling of a ship's pulley being blown by the wind. This is called the "sound of the aurora." However, according to scientific research, this sound is impossible. Because the aurora is often in the high sky 60 miles away, and the speed of sound needs five seconds to travel one mile, then the distance of 60 miles will take five minutes to reach the ground. Even the lightning and thunder do not coincide when reaching people's senses, so the light and sound of the aurora are even more inconsistent. Also, the air is so thin in the high sky where the aurora is located, how can the sound waves be rhythmically and continuously transmitted into people's eardrums? Therefore, the claim that there is a "sound of the aurora" is still a question.

What gases make up the aurora? The spectrum of the aurora has been photographed, proving that the main component it contains is nitrogen. Nitrogen is the main component of air, and it is the same in this high sky. The aurora's spectrum also contains that famous green "light band," which is due to the surge of oxygen, or because oxygen is in an extremely active stage. Other gases such as neon, [omitted characters due to illegibility] also exist in small amounts in this high sky, and these gases, though few in number, are sufficient to increase the color of the aurora.

The aurora is very closely related to magnetism. If electrons are emitted from the sun to the earth, they will pass through space and be attracted by the Earth's magnetic field, until they pass to the vicinity of the South or North Magnetic Pole in the high sky, and present spiral circles, circling around the "magnetic lines of force." Electrons moving forward in a spiral gradually gather in one direction near the North Magnetic Pole, and produce the aurora borealis due to enhanced ionization. Similarly, those tending towards the South Pole become the aurora australis. However, whether the aurora australis and aurora borealis appear at the same time has not yet been studied.

The particles emitted from the sun have positively charged, negatively charged, and neutral particles, and the emission methods include electrons, positrons, neutrons, and so on. And these charged particles have the potential to move towards the north and south poles of the Earth.

After the aurora borealis appears, many people believe that the weather is gradually deteriorating, just as many people believe that the moon is related to the weather. In fact, different types of weather can be seen in different places at the same time. The region where the aurora can be seen is also very wide, and the weather in various places is naturally different. Moreover, the aurora is suspended in the high sky 50 to 60 miles above the ground, while the airspace that affects the weather is at most less than 10 miles, and the highest cirrus clouds rarely exceed 6 miles. However, one thing is worth noting: the aurora borealis can only be seen on a clear day. It cannot be seen on a cloudy or rainy day because it is covered by clouds and fog.

There are now many methods used to explore the high sky. One method is to use balloons. The balloon is launched high into the sky and allowed to burst on its own and fall to the ground. Then, we can measure the height, temperature, and humidity of the air where the balloon reached. Another method is to use searchlights, which can focus the light in the high sky. The analysis of the light can determine the various gases contained in the air. In addition, there is the use of radio waves. Radio waves are broadcast into the air, and the response returns in an instant, which can also be used to measure the conditions in the high sky. With the help of these methods, the study of the aurora borealis will be more accurate and rich in the future.

### Commentary on "Thunderstorm"

— Da Dian

There is a Chinese saying, "Old wine in a new bottle." I think this saying is very appropriate to describe the play "Thunderstorm."

Since its debut, "Thunderstorm" has been performed dozens of times. In the past, due to the complexity of the plot and the emphasis on the characters' expressions, actors without deep theatrical training found it difficult and unrewarding to perform. Only after the China Traveling Theatre Company performed it did it cause a sensation. Every performance was a great success. This was indeed a triumph for the experienced and skilled professional actors of the China Traveling Theatre Company. The four-act play "Thunderstorm" itself also gained favorable reviews because of the China Traveling Theatre Company's performance.

In this chaotic era of ours, this era of great struggles between the old and the new, some dull-witted people are groping for a way out, while at the same time, in the process of advancing on that way out, they seem to have discovered the shadow of impending destruction. Their courage for life cannot withstand the fear of destruction. However, we are ultimately living beings, which means we must deal with our lives. In other words, in this contradictory environment, our senses are slow, stagnant, superficial, empty, and drifting. The only thing that comforts us is intense, unrealistic stimulation. Just as mythological stories like "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" and "Investiture of the Gods" in old dramas have become a source of comfort for the lower classes in this era, so too have plays like "Thunderstorm" become a source of comfort for the general petty bourgeoisie—especially those who are intellectually "liberated"—and the intellectual class in this era, which is not surprising.

However, another reason why "Thunderstorm" is popular is because of the playwright's skillful technique of hiding old content in a new guise, using the kind of stimulation that the general audience needs to entice their emotions.

Although "Thunderstorm" is a four-act play that takes more than four hours to perform, with over a dozen actors and dozens of scenes, the content is actually very simple and ordinary. Furthermore, because the theme that the author wants to promote seems to be approached with an evasive attitude, and this evasive attitude is also twofold, the result is a confusion of the theme. However, this confusion is the author's clever technique, but the effect it has on the audience is probably unexpected by the author, and at the same time, it is something that the author did not intend to anticipate. The material the author has adopted is indeed a novel and shocking story, but the author has not developed it, and has deliberately suppressed its development, simply turning it into a rigid, static story. Therefore, no matter how much the audience cries or laughs at those intensely stimulating scenes, it is just a superficial stimulation. They do not understand the theme at all, because they cannot grasp it in the first place. However, the reason why the China Traveling Theatre Company's performance of "Thunderstorm" was so successful was precisely because of the effect of those intense, stimulating scenes that made the audience cry and laugh. From the standpoint of box office success, the author's script is suitable for professional theatre companies.

The plot is as follows: There is a mine owner named Zhou Puyuan, who studied in Germany. In his youth, he fell in love with a maid named Shiping (according to the plot, it would be more appropriate to call it "illicit affair"). However, after she gave birth to their second son, because the Zhou family arranged for Zhou Puyuan to marry another woman, they drove her out (this is all said by Lu Shiping, and is not shown in the play). Shiping, carrying a newborn baby who was only three days old and sick, was banished and went to drown herself in the river. This was probably "Heaven's will," right? By chance, she encountered a "philanthropist" who rescued both her and the baby. This was probably also "divine blessing," right? The mother and child not only did not die, but also did not suffer any illness. Later, Shiping married two more times. Her last husband was named Lu Gui, and their child grew up to be Lu Dahai. During these twenty years of twists and turns, Zhou Fanyi, the wife of Zhou Puyuan after the first wife, and Zhou Ping, the son of Zhou Puyuan by his first wife Shiping, actually fell in love (it would be better to call this an "illicit affair"). It's truly "no coincidence, no story." At this time, Lu Gui became a servant in the Zhou family. Lu Gui recommended his daughter Sifeng, whom he had with Shiping, to work as a maid in the Zhou family. The eldest young master, Zhou Ping, seeing Sifeng's youth, fell in love with her and had a physical relationship, resulting in a three-month pregnancy. Since Zhou Ping had Sifeng, he naturally became cold towards Fanyi, and Fanyi's jealousy of Sifeng was inevitable. When Sifeng's mother returned from elsewhere, Fanyi invited her to talk, intending to ask her to take away the eyesore, Sifeng. It was very coincidental that Lu Dahai was working in Zhou Puyuan's mine and was elected as a representative due to a strike issue. He came to the Zhou family to negotiate with Zhou Puyuan. At the same time, Shiping came to the Zhou family and encountered Zhou Puyuan. Thus, the truth came to light. Zhou Puyuan then dismissed Lu Gui and Sifeng. However, Zhou Ping's passion for Sifeng did not die. That night, he braved the wind and rain to meet Sifeng at the Lu's house, only to be caught by Lu Dahai. Zhou Ping and Sifeng fled back to the Zhou's house, and Shiping and Dahai also rushed over. At this time, although Shiping knew the blood relationship between Zhou Ping and Sifeng, she still endured the pain in her heart and allowed them to escape together. Just then, Fanyi arrived, wanting to reveal her relationship with Zhou Ping to stop them. In this chaotic scene, Zhou Puyuan was also alarmed. He told Zhou Ping in front of everyone that Lu Shiping was his biological mother, and Sifeng immediately rushed out the door, touching a lightning-struck power line and dying. Zhou Ping committed suicide with a gun, and Fanyi and Shiping were both shocked into madness. In this way, this abusive story ended with the phrase "retribution is clear."

## Page 21

At first glance, the author's audacity is indeed frightening. However, because of the author's skill, this frightening story is gradually transformed into a mysterious story that conforms to "human emotions" and also conforms to "heavenly principles," "morality," and "conscience."

The characters that appear in this play not only include a "rebellious son" who has an affair with his stepmother, but also a jealous woman who resists her husband's oppression, and even a representative of striking workers, Zhou Chong, who speaks eloquently about equality and wants to eliminate class concepts, as well as Sifeng, who deceives her mother. The author uses "peaceful means" to deal with all these rebellious and dangerous elements.

Sifeng once swore an oath, denying that she had any "entanglements" with the young masters of the Zhou family. In the midst of thunder rumbling outdoors, she knelt before her mother and said, "If I deceive you, may I be struck by lightning!" It can be seen that "heavenly principles" are fixed. Ah! Although at that time, perhaps the Zhou family's house had "lightning rod" equipment? Using "lightning strike" is anti-scientific, but the author had already laid the groundwork, preemptively eliciting from Fanyi's mouth the dialogue that the electric pole had fallen. Therefore, Sifeng's death by hugging the electric wire not only "swore an oath," but also did not violate science at the same time. Similarly, Zhou Ping, this "rebellious son," should have suffered "divine punishment" with a "lightning strike," but in the end, he committed suicide with a gun: this is also very reasonable, because the gun was originally one of the "five thunders"!

Lu Dahai is a worker who dares to negotiate with Zhou Puyuan with a mouth full of "equality," and is even very violent. However, because the author wants to use his own abandoned son to stir up trouble, to show "retribution," Dahai is also perfunctorily deceived by Puyuan on the matter of the workers. Dahai knows that he is a poor man, and his sister should not marry the rich man Zhou Ping, and even uses knives and guns to oppose it. However, in the end, for the sake of his sister's "chastity" and the morality of "a woman not marrying twice," he also perfunctorily agrees, and even, contrary to his previous feelings, urges his mother to agree. The author's intention is to say that poverty and wealth are not irreconcilable, and that workers also have "morality."

Zhou Chong (Puyuan's second son) has some discrimination against old morals, so he also dies by electric shock with Sifeng, in order to avoid later danger. As for Fanyi, the "jealous woman" and "licentious woman," she is of course despised by our society, and dying of pestilence is her deserved "retribution."

The author's technique is exquisite!

Old wine in a new bottle. Although the bottle is beautiful and stylish, the taste of the wine is still the taste of old wine!

### The Invaded World Giant

— Gao Jiayou

The world giant mentioned here is not some prodigy who is making a big splash internationally, but a giant species that lives in a corner of today's "civilized world." This should be clarified first.

According to Magellan, who was the first to travel the world, when he and his companions were sailing through the Strait of Magellan a few days before, one day they landed on the near-eastern coast of the southern tip of South America and discovered huge human footprints on the sand. But at that time, they felt very terrified and did not dare to go out, so in the end they did not see the posture of that giant native, but simply called him Bigfoot. Later, due to European exploration, it was learned that this Bigfoot was even more of a world giant species. The height of this giant species is said to be seven feet! Europeans call them the Patagonians, and they call themselves the Tsoneca, which in their language means "human beings."

This famous world giant species originally lived in the Voslaplata Plain of South America. After the sixteenth century, due to the oppression of the invading Latin nations, they gradually moved south, and the grassland Pampa between the Andes Mountains south of 36 degrees south latitude and the Atlantic Ocean became their residence, which is where they live now. Speaking of their appearance, it is also slightly different from other human races: their heads are longer, their faces are very large, their eyebrows and beards are very sparse, they have dark eyes and black hair, and they are half-naked, which looks a bit scary. Regarding their origin, there is still no clear answer. Some say that from the perspective of ancient South American culture and even race, their origin is generally related to the Pacific Islands, but in any case, the origin of this giant species still needs to be further studied by scholars.

The life of the giant species is mainly based on hunting. Now they have horses, and they mostly use horsepower for hunting and walking. Horses can be said to be their most important living tool. But before 156 years ago, there were no horses in this place. At that time, they had to rely on their strong and sturdy feet to walk on the grasslands and chase wild animals. Their number was originally very large, but because of the persecution of "civilized" white people, because of the invasion of harsh climates and customs, there are probably only tens of thousands of them now.

Because life is still primitive, the giants do not know anything about God Jesus, nor do they know about Sakyamuni, that is to say, they do not have modern popular religious beliefs. What they believe in are spirits, both good and evil spirits. According to them, the good spirit is the spirit of the ancients. Now it lives in the caves in the mountains and is constantly blessing them. At the same time, this spirit also continuously breeds the sheep, camels, and ostriches necessary for their life, and enables them to capture these things. As for another evil spirit, it comes out when the good spirit is asleep, causing those ominous animals, foxes and wolves, to be active and harm them.

They are very afraid of that evil spirit. Every day, before the sun comes out, the warriors of the tribe have to light torches and chase the devil out from behind their tents. Sometimes the warriors also have to ride on horseback, waving torches and shouting loudly, chasing the evil spirit to a distant place.

The Patagonia region is blown by very strong westerly winds, so the giants specially build tents facing east. There is a thin path in the center of this area, which is used for tribal work contact. Now, they already have some cattle and sheep, but this is a recent thing. Before, they did not have horses and other domestic animals, and they were still purely a hunting nation. What they can do mainly is animal skin curtains and shawls. They have no banknotes or foreign money, and they have no modern trade knowledge. Instead, they engage in barter trade. The ostrich feathers that are unique to this place are the items most liked by white people. Many Europeans and Americans bring "cultural goods" to exchange with the giants. This may be said to be their "international trade."

The weapon used by the giants when hunting is their unique and ingenious flying stone. On the day of the hunt, the hereditary president designates forty people to participate. The people who participate in these activities have to prepare their saddles and perfect all the preparations the night before, and gather at the designated place at a certain time, just like an army going on an expedition. The most interesting thing is that when they set out to hunt, they must bring food and prepare a pinch of salt to put in their waists. According to their custom, they should not eat anything in the morning when they set out to hunt. They must eat something when they get wild animals. If it is at night, they raise smoke and fire to notify everything. That situation makes us actually understand the situation of primitive communication and understand how communication originated.

The Patagonia region is one of the most terrible places in the world, and the giants living here of course have no pleasure to speak of. But one thing that they think is happiness is that there are many wild animals and birds here, and their food and clothing are not a problem. At the same time, although they themselves do not enjoy the happiness of "civilization," they are very at peace with real life, and their temperament is innocent and naive. In fact, there is nothing barbaric. In the past, there were often legends that white people came here and were harmed by them, but that was caused by the persecution of the white people, and it was not that they harmed others for no reason. Now, because the number of foreigners coming here has increased, and due to the proof of many facts, the giants are in fact inherently loving to ordinary human beings. For example, when white people come here, they need their help in many places, and they are also very happy to help others without asking for any reward. This is what civilized people cannot do. However, if you do not respect yourself, recognize them as barbarians, and bully and persecute them, then their huge fists will also be rude to you.

The kind giants live a quiet and peaceful life like a painting. They are not dominated or oppressed by any power, and they live equally and freely with each other. The only thing that casts a shadow on their lives is the "civilized people" who come here to do business. Those "civilized people" often transport inferior beer to this place and sell it indiscriminately, sometimes even deceiving the giants out of their beautiful fur shawls and beautiful horses with one or two cups of beer, causing problems with their own clothing. If everything of the giants represents the primitive people, and everything of the "civilized people" who come here to do business represents the modern, then we have to ask the readers: Has humanity evolved? Or is it degenerating?

### Contending for Legitimacy

— Ding Fengbai

In the era of monarchical autocracy, as soon as the monarch died, a new monarch had to be established immediately to inherit the great treasure, because "the world cannot be without a monarch for a day." This is called inheriting the orthodox lineage.

Continued on page five.

## Page 22

## Page 23

A new decree should only be one, because "there are not two suns in a day, and the people have no two kings." This is called legitimacy. However, when the world is in turmoil and chaos, with "three dukes in one country," where you point to me as a fake, and I point to you as a rebel, which one is legitimate? Therefore, later historians have to determine who is legitimate and who is false. The standard for distinguishing between legitimacy and falsehood is to see how much territory they have, how long they have been in power, whether they belong to the bloodline of the previous dynasty, whether they occupy the old capital, and whether they are descendants of the Han nationality. However, despite the comments of later historians, who determine legitimacy and falsehood after the fact, it is very difficult to distinguish between legitimacy and falsehood at that time, and the common people under their "rule" can only recognize the ruler as legitimate and dare not distinguish.

From emperors vying for the legitimacy of the throne, it has also reached the academic and cultural circles vying for the legitimacy of the tradition. This is also "already nurtured in ancient times." Not to mention the distant past, just take the Tongcheng School and the Yanghu School of the Qing Dynasty as examples. They each inherited the mantle and had their own traditions, where you said I was fake and I said you were a rebel. Even today, there are still slogans of "learning has a teacher's transmission, following a certain family" and "either inheriting ancient texts or continuing modern texts." In addition, since ancient times, "writers have despised each other," so the contention for legitimacy is even more fierce than the contention for the throne. Many of them, like the contention for the legitimacy of the throne, are not necessarily contending for the legitimacy of someone or a certain school's scholarship and articles, but are mostly boasting of the close relationship between themselves and the person they follow, and thus claiming to be the legitimate successor of someone or a certain school. For example, Dai Cunzhuang, who considered himself a direct descendant of the Tongcheng School, once said, "I was born in the hometown of Wangxi Haifeng, and I dare not not take ancient texts as my responsibility." Because of the hometown relationship, one can inherit the legitimate lineage. Others, such as those who claim to be legitimate because of father-son relationships, uncle-nephew relationships, or father-in-law-son-in-law relationships, are even too numerous to mention. Thus, the legitimacy of scholarship and articles has also become the legitimacy of the succession to the throne.

There is no need for us to praise Mr. Lu Xun's scholarship and articles again. Naturally, we also hope that young people will learn his spirit and his articles and carry them on. However, as Mr. Lu Xun satirized during his lifetime, he definitely did not want people to treat him as a "tradition" to contend for, and he himself did not think that he had a "tradition." However, after his death, there were quite a few people contending for the tradition and contending for legitimacy.

Ms. Xu Guangping and Mrs. Lu Xun Zhaoping are contending for the legitimacy of Mr. Lu Xun, which is for royalties. A certain boss and a certain bookstore are each recommending one or two writers to contend for compiling the complete works of Lu Xun, which is for business. But what is the purpose of some young writers vying to carry the coffin, act as masters of ceremonies, and act as the general commander at the funeral? Moreover, from the texts of Xu Guangping and Kanzo Uchiyama commemorating Lu Xun, it seems that we have not seen a young writer serving the dying Lu Xun every morning and evening. From the young writers' own commemorative texts, we have only seen that they all went to see Lu Xun after he had passed away. So why, as soon as Lu Xun died, did they vie to snatch him over and hug him in their arms, pretending that "I have never shed tears like this when my father died," and when speaking to others, they also pretended to be sobbing and unable to speak? Since they were so sad, then what strength and spirit did they have to contend for the general commander, and even to the point of almost resorting to violence? How is this different from the princes and grandsons not burying the emperor, who had been dead for a long time and whose corpses had maggots crawling out, because they were vying for the throne? Does it mean that by contending like this, if you win and become the general commander, then Mr. Lu Xun's great treasure will be seized by you alone, and you can "coerce the emperor to command the princes," to command all the writers, to restore the flag of the "old literary general," and to ascend to the extreme of the "literary leader"?

Moreover, they are able to visit Mr. Lu, be close to Mr.'s morals, talk to Mr., and also be able to personally carry Mr.'s coffin, be the general commander, and even compile Mr. Lu's complete works. What a great honor! Truly "the luckiest few young people among the 400 million people in the Republic of China"! Even more fortunate than receiving Jesus' personal anointing and baptism!

But what does this have to do with inheriting Mr. Lu Xun's spirit and learning? Wasn't it clearly written in Lu Xun's will that "everyone takes care of their own lives"? Where does it tell you to contend for legitimacy?

Now let me quote a few words from Mr. Lu Xun to conclude:

"The misfortune of writers is not in being attacked and neglected during their lifetime. After death, their words and deeds disappear, and then unscrupulous people falsely claim to be confidants, and right and wrong arise like bees. They use this not only to defend themselves, but also to make money. Even the dead bodies have become their tools for selling fame and power, which is worth mourning." (Remembering Mr. Wei Suyuan)

### Problems of Resistance and Preparation for War

— Lu Jingzhi

It is imperative to resist aggression, China needs to resist now, and it is even becoming an era; in other words, China is entering an era of resistance—all this is truth, and no one denies it except traitors. Therefore, resistance is a universal proposition.

But if we further ask: is the timing for resistance better now or in the future? Should the resistance be carried out in a partial or national manner? … Everyone’s answer will be different. The most intense debate revolves around two propositions: resistance with preparation and resistance without preparation.

According to the argument for resistance with preparation, China's weapons are inferior to those of the enemy, and if we fight now, we will inevitably fail. Therefore, we must do preparatory work to accumulate sufficient strength before victory can be assured. Those who oppose this view call it "the theory of relying solely on weapons," and consider it the thinking of traitors. According to them, China should resist immediately, without preparation, which can be called the theory of resistance without preparation.

Regarding these two views, I believe the latter is more flawed. It is clearly an emotional theory of resistance, a blindly impulsive theory of resistance, and an unplanned theory of resistance. It confuses the theory of relying solely on weapons with traitorous thinking, and loses sight of reason in favor of emotion. Therefore, most of those who support it are young petty bourgeois. This is not because its truthfulness is sufficient, but because it is fundamentally petty bourgeois consciousness, which suits the tastes of young people.

Just think: resistance is a major event related to the survival of the nation. How can we not consider it? How can we not prepare for it? How can we not have a comprehensive plan? Reason is absolutely necessary here. From a factual point of view, China lags behind its enemies in everything. Taking weapons alone, if Engels's saying "pistols triumph over broadswords" is true, then isn't it obvious that China should prepare weapons?

Resistance requires weapons. Without weapons, how can we resist? To advocate resisting airplanes and artillery with bare hands is to dream of confronting sharp instruments with mere courage, which is idealistic in philosophy and not correct. To oppose Engels is obvious. This is bound to fail in reality and has no possibility of defeating the enemy. If the goal of resistance is to subdue the enemy and achieve victory, then we should not oppose preparation, but should advocate preparation.

Therefore, I believe that a true resister should have the following attitude towards weapons: the newer the guns and cannons, the better; the more airplanes, the better; the stronger the fortresses, the better; the more well-trained soldiers, the better; the more bullets stockpiled, the better… Combat certainly requires courage, but it also requires weapons. Only by uniting courage and weapons can we kill the enemy and achieve victory.

Therefore, our criticism of "the theory of relying solely on weapons" should not be based on opposing weapons or belittling weapons, but should point out its narrowness. That is to say, it only knows about the preparation of weapons, and does not know about other preparations besides weapons, such as economic, political, educational, cultural, diplomatic, etc. It does not know that modern warfare is not a simple military problem, but a competition of the entire national strength. Here, we should advocate large-scale preparation. True resistance requires full preparation for war. Therefore, resistance and preparation for war are not in conflict.

Therefore, separating and opposing resistance and preparation for war, and advocating resistance apart from preparation, is childish resistance. Otherwise, it is either using leftist empty talk to deceive people, or entrusting China's destiny to a desperate gamble. Such a theory of resistance is irresponsible and can only be believed by simple-minded people, inexperienced people, and those who use resistance to seek political gain. The correct theory of resistance is unified with the theory of preparation for war.

Simple-minded advocates of resistance say: if you prepare, won't the enemy also prepare? Moreover, their production is developed, and their tax revenue is high, so they are better prepared than you, so you will never be as good as them, what is the use of preparing? This is very reasonable and should serve as a warning to those who dream of turning the comparison of our broadswords to the enemy's pistols into a comparison of cannons to pistols.

But my theory of preparation for war is different. We should only prepare as many weapons as possible, and not necessarily turn the comparison of broadswords to pistols into a comparison of cannons to pistols. Judging from the economic capabilities of us and the enemy, it is enough to achieve a ratio of fewer pistols to more pistols. Because the decision of victory or defeat does not depend entirely on weapons. With sufficient weapons, plus other conditions superior to the enemy, victory can be assured. Therefore, the idea of preparing weapons should only be to shorten the distance that is too far apart.

At the same time, I believe that preparation for war should not abandon necessary resistance. That is to say, if resistance is necessary before the preparation for war has reached our minimum limit, we should resist immediately. Resistance without a guarantee of victory can of course be avoided. If it cannot be avoided and resistance is unavoidable, then we should resist immediately. Therefore, preparation for war is not preparing for war outside of resistance, but is unified with resistance. Prepare for war when resistance is not necessary; resist when resistance is necessary.

The theory of simple preparation for war also has its errors. It divides resistance and preparation for war too clearly, believing that we prepare for war at a certain time and resist at a certain time. In the period of preparation for war, we can only prepare for war, and we can only resist in the period of resistance. But it does not know that the enemy's invasion does not follow our plans. If the enemy invades during the period of preparation for war, and we merely prepare for war, without asking whether we should resist, and generally respond with insufficient preparation, then we have clearly committed an irreparable mistake, which will cause future problems. Therefore, the theory of simply preparing for war is incorrect.

Therefore, some proponents of resistance—those with simple views, regard preparation for war as not fighting, which also has a reason. But they are not correct in viewing the simple theory of preparation for war as a theory of not fighting. Their reason is that the citizens do not resist, and the rulers do not resist. In fact, they do not know at all that resistance is to protect property and defend political power. Therefore, all those who have property and all those who have political power must resist. Didn't the Manchu nobles resist for decades? Are the wars between China and England, China and France, the Anglo-French Allied Forces, China and Japan, and the Eight-Nation Alliance still fake? Even if you, Jianzhi, cannot remember these histories, then haven't you forgotten that A-Huang's resistance also won your sympathy? Any property owner or power holder will not surrender until the end of the resistance. Therefore, the saying that citizens do not resist and rulers do not resist is not reasonable. Those who prepare for war are those who resist. Their mistake lies not in not fighting, but in simply preparing for war, that is, metaphysically separating preparation for war from resistance.

Of course, saying that the rulers do not resist is not only based on regarding preparation for war as not fighting, but also has other facts as a basis. This is the well-known compromise. There have been many such compromises in recent years, and I believe no one is satisfied with them. But I don't think we can conclude from this that the rulers do not resist. All rulers have the nature of defending their political power and will never surrender until the end of the resistance. China has not yet had formal resistance, let alone the end, so how can we say that they will not resist? The compromise, I believe, is due to strategy—their overall plan. Everyone understands that advocating resistance is only a general guideline; but this guideline is not straight but curved, so it is not impossible to compromise. If the timing of resistance is not conducive, or a certain preparation is not timely, and there is a need for delay, then it can be done through compromise. If political analysts regard temporary compromise as permanent compromise, then they have committed the error of neglecting the essence with phenomena, which is not correct.

Here, we must know that a theorist of resistance should not be a warmonger. That is to say, he does not ask whether resistance is necessary, whether resistance can be temporarily avoided for the sake of full preparation, and only resists blindly, and resists at every turn. Such a theory of resistance is bound to be mechanistic, and there is bound to be a loss of indiscriminate resistance. On the other hand, we must also know that the compromise under the general line of resistance is not a vain compromise, a blind compromise, or an unlimited compromise. It is done for a purpose, is compromised only when necessary, and has a certain limit. In short, neither resistance nor compromise are for conditions, but each has its suitability. Truth is concrete, not abstract. This is a concept that should be noted.
