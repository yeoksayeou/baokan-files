### Enemy Troops Sneakily Land at Wenzaobang and Are Bitterly Defeated by Our Army

The Enemy Troops Who Attempted to Land Were Annihilated; an Enemy Ship Outside of Songkou Was Sunk by Our Forces

Yesterday (the 23rd), at dawn, more than twenty enemy ships gathered at Songkou, targeting the Yizao Canal, Zhanghuabang, and Shizilin areas of Wusong for a fierce attack. More than ten small vessels were dispatched, fully loaded with enemy troops, attempting to land stealthily. At the same time, enemy air forces also mobilized to provide support, bombing and strafing. Our defending troops responded calmly, remaining composed. When a large number of enemy land forces approached the shore, they launched a surprise attack, catching the enemy unprepared, using hand grenades and machine-gun fire. Our artillery also fired in support, resulting in the complete annihilation of the enemy forces on the spot. Simultaneously, an enemy ship outside the port was hit and sunk by our forces, suffering a disastrous defeat and a significant blow to their morale. The fierce fighting continued until yesterday afternoon. The enemy troops attempting to land in the Zhanghuabang and Wenzaobang areas had already fled back to their ships, and those who had landed were also annihilated by our forces, leaving piles of corpses. This was the greatest sacrifice suffered by the enemy since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. Although our forces also suffered considerable losses, the aggressive spirit of the elite Japanese troops has been largely extinguished. It is believed that the enemy's plan had been detected by our side early on, so strict precautions were taken and were never relaxed. As for the left, center, and right wings, our troops continued to advance yesterday. The central route army has advanced to Huishan Park and Broadway Road, where there was fierce fighting in the area of the Kangyuan Factory, resulting in heavy enemy losses. The enemy troops on the right flank of North Sichuan Road launched a counterattack at one point, but were repulsed by our forces. At around 5:00 AM this morning, enemy ships in the Huangpu River again fired heavy artillery, bombarding Pudong.

### Our Bloody Resistance Against the Enemy at Wenzaobang

The Enemy Sneakily Landed at the Lianglu Ju Wharf; Our Army Fought a Bloody Battle for Five Hours Before the Enemy Was Defeated; One Enemy Ship Was Sunk by Our Artillery

Confirmed information reveals that the enemy troops were suffering successive defeats in the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts. The Huangpu River bank was no longer a viable landing point, and even if they landed, they could not deploy or unleash their firepower. Several days ago, our side learned that an enemy reinforcement division had arrived outside Wusongkou, assembled on ships, and were in dire straits. They would inevitably try to land in the Wusong area or at various ports along the Yangtze River. Our army had made early arrangements. The day before yesterday (the 22nd), more than twenty enemy ships sailed to Songkou. Our side received the report and determined that the enemy would take action at night or at dawn. As expected, at 1:00 AM yesterday morning (the 23rd), more than thirty enemy ships concentrated outside Wusongkou and on the Zhanghuabang River, bombarding our positions with concentrated artillery fire. Our entire line calmly stood ready, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Around 2:00 AM, the enemy on the Zhanghuabang River used multiple barges, fully loaded with infantry, to rush towards the area between the Lianglu Ju Wharf and Wenzaobang. Our defending troops waited until the enemy was close before unleashing a fierce machine-gun barrage, and the fighting was extremely intense. More than a thousand enemy troops took advantage of a slight weakness in our firepower to land near Wenzaobang. Our troops firmly defended the line from Wujiaqiao, Xujiazhai, Yaojiazhai, to Zhanghuabang Station, resisting for five hours. Our □□ troops reinforced from the □□□ two roads, launching a full-scale attack. The enemy troops who had landed had not yet gained a firm foothold, and the rest of the troops were attempting to cross the river. After our army's fierce attack, using both firepower and hand-to-hand combat, the enemy was completely annihilated around 8:00 AM. Subsequently, our artillery concentrated its firepower and fired at the enemy ships, resulting in the sinking of one enemy ship. In this battle, the enemy suffered approximately 1,200 casualties, while our army also suffered more than 300 casualties. As for the Shizilin area, the enemy never succeeded. At around 1:00 PM, a certain military organization received a telegram from the front-line combat troops detailing the battle, stating that they were still on high alert.

While the battle at Chang Wenzaobang and Zhanghuabang was intense, the Shizilin area was also very tense, and the number of Japanese soldiers landing there was even greater, making the battle even more critical. The enemy's arrogance was rampant, fully intending to fight desperately, to provide cover for the eastern Shanghai district, and to try to turn the tide. Our army, resting and waiting, launched a counterattack, fighting heroically in hand-to-hand combat for a long time. The enemy finally could not withstand the defeat, and their landing attempt was once again foiled. Furthermore, a portion of the enemy troops who did not have time to escape were captured and detained by our side.

### Our Planes Raided Enemy Ships This Morning

Central News Agency: Around 1:30 AM this morning, our planes flew to Shanghai and raided enemy ships at night. When our planes flew over the Shanghai area, enemy ships in the Huangpu River hastily fired anti-aircraft guns wildly. Our planes calmly flew over, going straight to Songkou to bomb enemy ships.

The sounds were clearly audible within twenty li. The fighting stopped at 3:10 AM, then resumed after a while, becoming more intense at 4:00 AM, with gunfire as dense as a string of pearls. Around 6:00 AM, street battles successively broke out near the China Merchants Bureau's northern wharf on East Broadway Road, as well as Huashun Wharf, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Yihola Road, and Macleod Road. According to an official statement made at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy troops retreated while setting fires along the way.

The enemy is using Huishan Park as a base and is putting up a stubborn resistance. Our army is determined to bravely advance from here, hoping to join forces with our troops near the Huishan Wharf to encircle and eliminate the large enemy forces in the Huangpu Wharf area.

### We Bombed the Enemy Headquarters Twice

Our Side Concentrates Artillery Fire to Destroy It; Fire Breaks Out and Spreads at the Japanese Elementary School on North Sichuan Road

Central News Agency: Yesterday morning at dawn and around 10:00 AM, our □□ artillery positions again used heavy artillery to bombard the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. Our artillery fire was extremely accurate, and the enemy was in a miserable state. It was witnessed that the enemy headquarters was surrounded. The remaining enemy troops were merely relying on their solid buildings for their last struggle. Our side has now decided to concentrate artillery fire and destroy them.

Central News Agency: The Japanese elementary school on North Sichuan Road is also one of the enemy's important bases. It was hit by our forces and caught fire the night before last, spreading rapidly. It did not go out until yesterday morning.

Shenshi News Agency reported: At dawn yesterday, the remnants of the enemy troops gathered on North Sichuan Road, using heavy artillery armored vehicles as cover, launched a counterattack from Wusong Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhaopu Road, and other places towards our army's right-wing positions, attempting to break through our strong positions there in order to relieve the encirclement of the enemy headquarters. However, our army's fortifications were extremely solid. Although the enemy launched a fierce charge, they failed to damage us in the slightest. Furthermore, our army, ambushing in various key points, used machine guns to mow down the enemy, causing them to fall one after another, with more than a hundred deaths. After a shift in the fighting, the enemy eventually collapsed and retreated. Currently, our army has advanced from Zhongzhou Road, Heskell Road, and Xingjiazai Road, encircling the enemy positions.

### Artillery Fire Broke Out Again Last Night

Twice Bombarding Enemy Ship Positions; Enemy Ships Immediately Returned Fire

The enemy ships immediately returned fire, and the sound of artillery gradually subsided until 8:40 PM.

### A Total of Seventeen Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River

Returned After Their Unsuccessful Attack on Songkou; The Izumo Anchored at Buoy No. 3 in the Huangpu

Central News Agency: The night before last, twenty enemy ships from the Bailonggang area of Chuansha sailed into the Huangpu River. Together with more than ten enemy ships in the river, they were led by the Izumo yesterday morning to attack our Shizilin, Zhanghuabang, and Wenzaobang areas, attempting to land. However, due to our army's strong defenses, they ultimately failed. Subsequently, the various ships, large and small, led by the Izumo, gradually sailed back into the Huangpu River after 10:00 AM yesterday morning. According to investigations conducted by reporters in the Huangpu River from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM yesterday, the berthing situation of the various enemy ships is as follows: Two cruisers at the Takashimacho waterfront; two cruisers at the Donggou waterfront; two destroyers of the 22nd Destroyer Division at the fish market; one destroyer of the No. 1 Destroyer Division at the water plant; one gunboat at the Tongxing Yarn Factory waterfront; one gunboat at the Asia Oil Depot waterfront; one destroyer at the Lanlu waterfront; one destroyer at the water plant waterfront; one gunboat at Buoy No. 10; one flagship Izumo at Buoy No. 2; one destroyer (No. 21) at Buoy No. 1; one destroyer each of the 21st and No. 1 Destroyer Divisions at the Mitsubishi Company pier; and one enemy transport ship berthed at the Zhao Shangzhong Wharf, totaling seventeen ships.

He also expressed the hope to build an air base here. He finished his assignment the day before yesterday and returned to his country.

### The War Reports Carried in Western Newspapers Are Bizarre

50,000 Japanese Troops Land; How Can This Be Done in a Few Hours?

Yesterday (the 23rd), the English-language "China Press" reported that approximately 50,000 Japanese troops landed in the Wusongkou Wenzaobang area yesterday morning, which has caused great concern in all quarters. The reporter specifically inquired about the matter with relevant parties. According to their discussion, such bizarre news must be a false war report by the enemy. Regardless of our army's defensive strength, just based on the facts, one must ask whether it is possible for 50,000 troops to land entirely in a few hours. Based on common sense, we can also determine that it is unfounded.

### Our Army Fights Bloodily to Kill the Enemy at Kangyuan Factory with Heroic Feats

Our Army Charges and Engages in Hand-to-Hand Combat, Disregarding Their Own Safety; They Kill More Than Fifty Enemy Soldiers Successively

According to someone who witnessed the battle between our army and the enemy on Huade Road, when our army entered the Kangyuan Factory, the enemy had not yet noticed. More than ten of our soldiers, armed with machine guns and rifles, hid on the third floor. At that moment, about twenty enemy soldiers densely passed by the door downstairs. Our soldiers fired their guns simultaneously, and the enemy immediately fell to the ground, with no survivors. Not long after, an enemy officer of middle rank and two accompanying soldiers rode horses past, seeing the enemy corpses lying across the road. While they were reining in their horses in surprise, our soldiers aimed and fired, and the officer was shot and fell off his horse. The corpses were carried onto the horses by the accompanying soldiers and taken away. That night, more than a hundred enemy soldiers charged towards the factory's playground. Our army immediately mowed them down with machine guns, and the enemy fled in panic. After inspecting the corpses, it was found that thirty-seven enemy soldiers had been killed, and our army had no casualties. Knowing that they could not break through our army, the enemy increased their forces and concentrated in the alleys opposite, relying on buildings for defense. In order to annihilate the enemy, our army sent a platoon to attack the enemy. The enemy concentrated their fire and mowed them down. On the spot, only nine of our soldiers were unharmed. They immediately charged into the alley and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, killing more than ten enemy soldiers. In this battle, only two of the ten soldiers in this platoon survived. However, because enemy reinforcements arrived, they are still in a stalemate. This kind of heroic fighting spirit is truly worthy of special mention in the history of the revival of the Chinese nation. This afternoon (the 23rd), the enemy opposite the factory fired sulfur bombs, and the factory was hit and caught fire. Our army put out the fire while fighting back, and the enemy ultimately failed.

### A Reporter from the "North China Daily News" Based in Beijing Exposes Japanese False Propaganda

Enemy Air Force's Victory Is Entirely Unfounded

Central News Agency: Today (the 22nd), the Shanghai "North China Daily News" published a special dispatch from its reporter stationed in Nanjing, refuting the news spread by the Japanese side in recent days about the air force's success as unfounded. The translation is as follows: This morning, Japanese radio broadcast news stating that Japanese planes had destroyed several Chinese airfields in Nanjing and destroyed several Chinese planes. According to investigations, this is purely a fabrication by the Japanese side. The reporter (from the "North China Daily News" based in Beijing, hereinafter referred to as such) went to the Ming Palace and Jurong airfields today with several British and American army and navy officers for inspection. Only one workshop was seen inside the Ming Palace airfield, and three bombs had landed, including one plane that was being repaired. Other than that, there was no damage. As for the Jurong airfield, eight bombs had landed 30 yards away from the airfield's hangar, destroying one old training plane, and there was no other damage. According to Mao Bangchu, the deputy commander of the Chinese Air Force's front line, who told British and American army and navy officers that a total of 34 Japanese planes had been shot down in recent days, including 24 heavy bombers. The Chinese side had not had a single plane shot down, with only one plane being forced to land, two suffering minor damage, and three being bombed on the ground. The reporter then inspected the destroyed Japanese planes with the British and American army and navy officers, including several twin-engine planes, all of which had been shot down near Nanjing. The reporter and others then met with the Chinese Air Force soldiers, one of whom told the reporter that he had shot down four Japanese planes by himself. After the inspection today, the group, including the British and American army and navy officers, are all convinced that China has achieved a great victory in the air war in recent days.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Problem of Small Denomination Currency

— Ren

It has been more than ten days since the Shanghai war began. Undoubtedly, we have a considerable advantage in the progress of military operations on the front lines. As for the economic order in the rear, it can generally be said to be relatively stable. However, from the day the war broke out, the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for small denomination currency in the market suddenly appeared. General stores refuse to give change, so that large denomination currency of five yuan and ten yuan has become practically unusable. Furthermore, the exchange merchants arbitrarily lower exchange rates for small denomination currency. Although citizens have repeatedly appealed, and money exchange businesses and chambers of commerce have made efforts, in fact, this serious phenomenon still exists.

The biggest reason for the shortage of small denomination currency in Shanghai this time is probably due to "hoarding." Many people, for the sake of their own convenience in future small-scale consumption, have hoarded a large amount of small denomination currency. Some ignorant civilians have even mistaken nickel coins for silver, carrying out their "safety first" policy by sealing them up in packages, so that what is left in the market has become large denomination paper money of five yuan and ten yuan. Because of this decrease in small denomination currency, the value of small denomination currency has naturally increased, which has led to people to place even more importance on small denomination currency. This causes a cyclical effect, and without proper measures, maintaining the exchange rate is naturally difficult.

This decrease in the quantity of small denomination currency and the gradual decrease in the exchange rate can cause at least two major harms during the current period of resistance. (This is naturally not limited to the current situation in Shanghai.) First, it threatens the livelihood of the common people. Second, it creates currency disorder. We know that since the beginning of the war, due to the urgent need for supplies, prices have obviously risen. At the same time, because of the shutdown of many industries, most of those who originally had jobs have become unemployed. Therefore, compared with the situation before the outbreak of the war, the purchasing power of the general public has undoubtedly been greatly reduced. Therefore, the reduction of the exchange rate of subsidiary currency at present is tantamount to giving the already reduced purchasing power of the general public another threat. In this way, the common people (at least in the current situation) will be unable to make a living, which will cause social unrest in the rear. Second, if this phenomenon of insufficient small denomination currency is allowed to continue, then the decimal currency system that we have so painstakingly maintained will collapse invisibly. Moreover, during the period of prolonged war, many private currencies may be issued due to the lack of small denomination currency. During the European War, Germany, due to the shortage of small denomination currency, had many alternative currencies issued by various cities, groups, and large factories, resulting in a myriad of currencies. We also feel that we need to pay attention to this experience.

Based on the above, we believe that the war is just beginning, and there is still time for all the facilities. We sincerely hope that the Chang Ju can study and review this small denomination currency problem in advance, because this problem seems to be more prominent in Shanghai at present, but in fact it will spread to the whole country in the future. In our humble opinion, we should now consider the required quantity and issue an appropriate amount of unified small denomination banknotes according to the flow and process (of course, not indiscriminately). As for the current nickel coins, we believe that they should be gradually recovered for the needs of the military industry. At the same time, there are many technical inconveniences in issuing nickel coins during wartime. If small denomination currency can be adjusted to make up for the shortage, it will be of considerable assistance to the purchasing power of the general public. As for how to fundamentally enable the unemployed to generate purchasing power, the mobile industry discussed in yesterday's newspaper is also an excellent solution, which will not be repeated here.

### British Prime Minister Chamberlain Returns to London to Discuss Shanghai Situation

Tomorrow's Parliament to Discuss Neutral Zone Proposal; British and French Reinforcements Continuously Arriving in Hong Kong en Route to Shanghai

[London] According to opinions from various newspaper diplomatic correspondents, British Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to return to London on Tuesday night. The reason is to discuss the Shanghai situation and the official responses from various countries to Britain's proposal to guarantee the safety of the International Settlement when Chinese and Japanese troops withdraw. These responses are expected to be fully received by Wednesday. Although China and Japan have not yet formally responded, London sources believe that China will not oppose the plan. While Japan has shown signs of rejection, there is still a faint hope that it might not insist on its own way and risk recklessness. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)

[London] Today, the Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent reported that the British government will hold a cabinet meeting on Wednesday to discuss the proposal for the neutralization of the Shanghai International Settlement. The British Foreign Office hopes that both the Chinese and Japanese governments will have submitted their replies by then. The correspondent believes that there is little hope for the acceptance of Britain's proposal. The Times also believes that the proposal is difficult to realize, saying that Japan will try its best to undermine the proposal, while China may accept it in principle. Britain reserves the freedom to act to protect Shanghai's interests. Wednesday's cabinet meeting is informal and not a full cabinet meeting, it is said. (23rd, Kuo Min Hai Tung Telegraph)

[Tokyo] Today, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson confirmed that it had received the British government's note demanding compensation for the losses suffered by British residents in Shanghai, but did not comment. The spokesperson also said that the commander of the U.S. fleet in Shanghai requested that the Japanese flagship leave the area near the American naval vessel. The commander of the Japanese fleet, Admiral Hase, moved the flagship elsewhere after receiving this request, it is said. (23rd, Kuo Min News Agency)

(London) Rumors that Britain plans to evacuate all British nationals from Shanghai and will submit the plan for cabinet discussion are completely unfounded. Because British nationals have businesses in Shanghai and are unwilling to leave, the government has no intention of forcing them to leave, it is said. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)

(Hong Kong) The Sykes Battalion of the British Army, originally stationed in Singapore, will arrive here tomorrow for temporary stationing. If the situation in Shanghai deteriorates, it will be deployed there. (23rd, Kuo Min Telegraph)

(Hong Kong) A battalion of French troops arrived here yesterday aboard the Sphinx. It left for Shanghai today. The ship also carried four British military doctors, four nurses, and a large quantity of medical supplies to meet the urgent needs of Shanghai. (23rd, Kuo Min Telegraph)

(Hong Kong) A large detachment of French infantry departed Hong Kong this morning aboard the French transport Sphinx, heading to Shanghai. Three more large detachments of French soldiers will successively go to Shanghai, two of which are from Annam, and the remaining one is from France. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)

### British Newspapers Comment on the Shanghai War

Japan Intends to Destroy Shanghai

[London] The Manchester Guardian today commented on the Shanghai situation, stating that Japan does not care about the war's impact on Shanghai. The destruction of Shanghai is, in fact, Japan's intention. The newspaper went on to explain that Japan's policy is divided into three stages: ⑴ Defeat China, ⑵ After defeating China, cause moral and material collapse in China, ⑶ Then use this collapse to absorb any part of China or make it "autonomous," and then reduce the central government to a subordinate of Japan to fulfill its great desire for "close cooperation." Therefore, Shanghai is the way Japan weakens China. What is regrettable is that China is fighting to protect its own territory, while Japan is fighting for aggression. However, the one place that both sides are fighting over and destroying is Shanghai. But the stronger the Chinese army, the greater the losses suffered by Shanghai, it is said. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)

### Rumor: China Has Accepted in Principle British Proposal for Shanghai Neutralization

As Long as It Does Not Hinder Our Self-Defense Stance; Japan Does Not Approve of the Proposal

[London] Regarding the British proposal for the neutralization of Shanghai, although neither China nor Japan has given a final answer, it is reported that China has accepted it in principle, provided that it does not hinder China's self-defense stance. Japan's attitude is not to approve of Britain's proposal, so the British government is quite disappointed, but is still persuading Japan to change its attitude in Tokyo, it is said. Furthermore, the Japanese side believes that the arrival of reinforcements in Shanghai will lead to a major victory. Before achieving a major victory, there is no room for considering the British proposal, it is said. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)

### Japan to Add Huge Military Expenditure

Two Billion Yuan

[Tokyo] The Japanese authorities will request an increase in military expenditure of 2,000,000,000 yuan when they convene a special parliament in September for use in the war against China. (22nd, Kuo Min Hai Tung Telegraph)

[San Francisco] Overseas Chinese here are raising funds for the resistance against Japan. Today, according to the organizers, the amount has exceeded US$100,000, of which US$30,000 has been remitted back to China for emergency relief. (23rd, Kuo Min Telegraph)

### Tragic Bombing at the Intersection of Nanking Road and Chekiang Road Yesterday Afternoon

Estimated 500 Casualties; Surrounding Shops All Affected; Bomb on Szechuen Road Fortunately Did Not Explode

Yesterday afternoon at 1:05 PM, a major tragedy suddenly occurred in the most prosperous area of the International Settlement, at the intersection of Nanking Road and Chekiang Road, commonly known as the Crystal Building area, resulting in no fewer than 500 casualties. The events are recorded in detail below.

Casualties Piled Up; A Horrifying Sight

Yesterday at 1:05 PM, while the area was bustling with pedestrians, a stray bomb suddenly flew in from the northeast, hitting the window along the street on the second floor of the Kwong Sang & Co. building, across from the Five Dragons Pond barbershop at the intersection of Chekiang Road and Nanking Road. It exploded immediately with a thunderous sound, shaking all of Shanghai. Iron fragments flew everywhere. Investigations revealed that in addition to destroying the toy department and Western restaurant on the second floor of Sincere & Co., as well as the bottom level of the third floor, it also affected nearby Wing On Co., Shen Da Cheng pastry shop, Tsi Chee Tsuen candy store, Yat Sang Lau restaurant, Yat Lok Teahouse, Hupeh Road, Ying Wah Street, Kweichow Road, and Tientsin Road, covering an area of up to 30 meters. In an instant, vehicles and pedestrians on the road were piled with dead and injured, and blood flowed like a canal. In the disaster area, from the New World Company to the San You Book Company, windows and glass were completely shattered, neon lights fell to the ground, and electrical circuits were also broken.

Police and Rescue All Mobilized

At the time, British troops, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the fire brigade, and the relevant police station's detectives and police vehicles, ambulances, all mobilized and rushed to the scene. They first blocked traffic in all directions, then sent the dead and severely injured to various hospitals for treatment. Some were missing arms and legs, some were missing a hand or foot, some had ruptured abdomens with intestines spilling out, and blood and flesh were mixed together. It was a horrifying sight.

Sent to Hospitals for Emergency Bandaging

The injured men, women, children, and elderly who were not killed at the scene wailed in grief, which was even more heartbreaking. Many died on the way to the hospital. Therefore, the entrances of various hospitals, such as the Country Hospital, Shantung Hospital, Chinese Red Cross Hospital, and Hong Ren Hospital, were piled with male and female corpses that could not be treated in time. Those with serious injuries were bandaged before being discharged, while others remained hospitalized for treatment. The total number of casualties reached over 500. Among them were four Western nationals. Until 7:00 PM, the various hospitals were still rushing to bandage the injured. At the same time, family members of the deceased who had received the tragic news went to the hospitals to identify the bodies. Therefore, the entrances of the hospitals were filled with wails, which was extremely sorrowful. And the most heartbreaking thing at that time was a boy of about five or six years old passing by Yat Sang Lau with his parents. Both of his parents had died, but the child was only slightly injured and still stood on the road, crying out for his mother. The reporter could not help but burst into tears while writing this.

Statistics of Deaths and Injuries: Over 500 People

Two Indian policemen directing traffic at the intersection were killed on the spot. Two Chinese policemen, No. 1051 and No. 2000, also died on the way to the hospital. As for Westerners, according to current information, there were a total of four. One was a German boy, 17 years old, who had decided to buy a boat ticket and return to Germany today, but unfortunately, he was also killed, which is very regrettable. In addition, there was Mr. Bellingham, a special correspondent in Shanghai for the London Times, and Mr. Brunner of Swedish nationality, both of whom were seriously injured and are now receiving treatment at the Country Hospital. There was also one other Westerner whose name is unknown. As for the Chinese, the names or occupations that have been identified include Guo Yi-ming, the assistant manager of Wing On Company, and Feng Run, an employee, both of whom were seriously injured and are now receiving treatment at Shantung Hospital. Bian Yulin, the manager of Star Theater, and an employee of International Radio Station were killed. In addition, there was an accountant from the Shanghai Municipal Council Telephone Company, a student from a Sino-French school, two employees from International Radio Station, and two men surnamed Wei and Qiu, who were seriously injured and are now receiving treatment at Country Hospital and Hong Ren Hospital. There were also countless deceased whose names were unknown. However, the total number of injured who have been sent to hospitals is as follows: Country Hospital rescued over 200 men, women, and children, of whom 50 have died from serious injuries, over 50 are awaiting treatment for serious injuries, and over 100 have minor injuries and were discharged after bandaging. The Chinese Red Cross rescued a total of 40 people, of whom 15 have died, and 25 are still hospitalized. Shantung Hospital rescued a total of over 200 people, of whom 26 have died, about 60 or 70 are seriously injured, and over 100 have minor injuries and returned home after bandaging. Hong Ren Hospital rescued a total of four people, as well as three or four Chinese men who were slightly injured and left the hospital after bandaging. In addition, the Great China Road Vienna also rescued 19 people, of whom four with minor injuries were discharged, while the other 15 were still hospitalized due to more serious injuries. At that time, after the various rescue organizations and vehicles sent the injured to the hospitals, firefighters began to clear the corpses, severed limbs, and broken bricks and glass shards. After three or four hours of active work, the tragic scene was slightly covered up, but broken walls and ruins were still visible everywhere. As for the bodies killed on the spot, the Pu Shan Shan Zhuang burial team dispatched a large burial vehicle and over ten porters to handle the situation. They first laid all the corpses horizontally in the square temporarily, awaiting application for court inspection and family identification for coffins and burial. If there were no family members to claim the bodies, the Zhuang would bury them on their behalf. However, all the coffins in the Zhuang have been used for the Great World tragedy, so it is hoped that all sectors of society will provide assistance to complete this benevolent act.

Bomb on Szechuen Road Fortunately Did Not Explode

Before the stray bomb landed at the intersection of Nanking Road and Chekiang Road at 1:05 PM yesterday, causing a major tragedy, a large bomb also landed at a foreign merchant's warehouse behind the British firm Butterfield & Swire and the Hamilton House on Szechuen Road at 1:03 PM. According to witnesses, they first heard a whooshing sound, then the sound of foreign tin breaking, followed by a wisp of black smoke and the sound of something falling. All of this happened in an instant. When the bomb fell into the warehouse, it broke through the roof. Fortunately, the warehouse was full of grain, with flour on top and rice bags in the middle layer. Therefore, the bomb fell directly into the flour and grain, and did not explode. It was found that the site was close to Mobil Oil's oil station, which stored a large amount of gasoline. If it had exploded, the disaster would have been unimaginable. After the incident, the police immediately dispatched several police vehicles and fire trucks to guard the area, blocked traffic, and tried to remove the unexploded bomb. They first tried to remove the explosives from the bomb, and then studied the type of bomb and where it came from. It is said that there was a hard stamp on the bomb casing, shaped like a cup, with the letters S on both sides, and two dots below.

Report from the Municipal Council

According to the Municipal Council's report from noon to 2:00 PM, the stray bomb on Nanking Road landed at 1:12 PM. According to statistics at 3:00 PM, the number of deaths was estimated to be between 100 and 200. After the incident, all ambulances, freight vehicles, and fire trucks in the Central District immediately rushed to the rescue. The bodies of the victims were quickly removed, and the injured were sent to nearby hospitals.

In addition, it is rumored that another bomb landed in the French Concession, but fortunately did not explode.

Another bomb landed in a warehouse behind Hamilton House.

炮 shells also fell near Thorne Road and Range Road.

Two Bombs Fired at the Same Time

According to reliable sources from Westerners, the bomb on Nanking Road was at 1:05 PM, and the bomb on Szechuen Road was at 1:03 PM. The interval between them was only two minutes. Based on the time, it can be concluded that they were fired at the same time. It has also been determined that they were bombs. Further study of the bomb found on Szechuen Road revealed that it was the same as the one on Nanking Road. The bomb on Szechuen Road was three and a half feet long, with the letter S on each side, and a yellow coin-shaped stamp.

### Account of Surviving the Massacre

The Enemy Army Killed Our People in a Most Tragic Way; Our Army Showed Great Compassion and Led Them to Safety

My friend Mr. Lu escaped from the enemy's aerial strafing on Ward Road, Tsi Tsi Har Road, and Chung Hing Li yesterday. He met with the reporter in the afternoon and described in detail the progress of our army's victory and his escape. I recorded it below.

When the war first started, only distant artillery sounds were heard, so no attention was paid. By the time the enemy army retreated on the 16th, it was impossible to escape. After the enemy retreated, they set up four machine guns in the former Ming Garden dog racing track, and two heavy machine guns in front of the Japanese Hsiang Sheng Automobile Company on Huasheng Road. A cannon was also placed at the Yulin Road intersection. At the same time, our army also densely deployed sandbags and barbed wire and set up machine guns at various key points on Tsi Tsi Har Road (entrance of the Oriental Bathhouse), Huasheng Road, Tao Peng Road, Liaoyang Road, Jingzhou Road, Dalian Wan Road, and Baoding Road (all north of Ward Road), less than a hundred paces away from the enemy army. The two forces were in a state of confrontation. Therefore, when the enemy saw our citizens escaping from their houses, they strafed them with machine guns. So far, on the stretch of Ward Road from Gao Lang Bridge to Baoding Road, no fewer than a hundred people have been tragically killed, and their bodies have not been buried. It is a most tragic sight.

I (Mr. Lu referring to himself) remained hidden in my house, afraid to open the door, for six days. It was not until about 5:00 PM the day before yesterday that Shunji Li, Wuhua Li, and Ward Fang on Ward Road were set ablaze, and the fire had spread to the street shops in Chung Hing Li. At this point, I called on about sixty neighbors who had not escaped from the alley and, under the cover of thick smoke, rushed out of Chung Hing Li and fled straight into our army's defense line on the opposite Tsi Tsi Har Road. When there were only about ten people left at the rear, they were discovered by the enemy in front of the Hsiang Sheng Automobile Company at the southern entrance of Huasheng Road, who hastily strafed them with machine guns. It was too late, so no one was injured. When they entered our army's position, our front-line officers and soldiers were extremely kind and comforting to them. At the same time, they were led by people and given instructions on the route to escape. They detoured to Jiangwan overnight, then to Dachang, and then to the Special District, where they were able to meet with you, he said. While speaking, he could not help but weep.

### Telegrams of Condolence to Chang Chih-chung

General Chang Chih-chung, Garrison Commander of Shanghai and Nanking, has received numerous telegrams of condolence from various parties in recent days. The following are excerpts: ⑴ To Commander Chang Wen-bo, with admiration. Your heroic troops struck directly, sweeping away the enemy like withered leaves. Our military prowess is displayed. The whales and carp in the sea cease their waves. The sound of your fame spreads. The birds and mice in the region hide their traces. I admire your dragon-like response and ability to adapt. Your brother, Chu Chia-hua, pays his respects. ⑵ To Commander Chang Wen-bo and all the officers and soldiers at the front, with admiration. You have established outstanding merit in resisting the enemy in Shanghai, crushing the fierce vanguard of the violent Japanese and inspiring the morale of the entire nation. I am overjoyed beyond words and send this telegram of condolence. The Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters pays its respects. ⑶ To Commander Chang, Commissioner Song, and Director Yan, please forward to all the officers and soldiers at the front, with admiration. This time, the violent enemy has launched a large-scale invasion. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers at the front have repeatedly achieved success. We are filled with admiration. We especially send this telegram of condolence. We hope you will redouble your efforts, sweep away the evil forces, and achieve final victory. We will lead the way in providing support from Tibet. The Anti-Japanese Support Association pays its respects.

### Belgian Nationals in China Express Sympathy to Our Country

President of the Belgian Chamber of Commerce Receives Representatives from All Sectors

Mr. Elles, President of the Belgian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, invited Belgian students and Belgian nationals in China to a discussion at the Belgian Consulate yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than forty people attended, including Dr. He Huimeng, former ambassador to Russia, and Mr. Van Outaen, Belgian Consul-General in Shanghai. Regarding our country's current war of resistance against Japan, Belgian nationals in China expressed their extreme sympathy to our country and their deep belief that final victory would belong to us.

### Madame Kung Raises Funds to Purchase Vehicles

Already Sent to the Front Lines for Use

Madame Kung, Soong Ai-ling, recently raised donations from Chinese customs officials and purchased four trucks and three cars, worth 55,000 yuan, which have been sent to the front lines for use.

### China National Aviation Corporation's Hankow-Chengtu Line Still Operating

Shanghai-Canton and Shanghai-Hankow Lines Temporarily Suspended; No Government Requisitioning

The China National Aviation Corporation plays an important role in transportation and postal services. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, various lines have been suspended. To clarify the truth, the reporter visited the company yesterday. According to the person in charge, the China National Aviation Corporation is a joint venture between China and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the enemy planes have bombed the Longhua Airport, hoping to destroy our aviation transportation. All the planes have flown out and suffered very little damage. The foreign pilots, after receiving notices from the American consulate, have either left the Shanghai war zone with their families or are in alert areas. Furthermore, because the Longhua Airport is not easy to repair immediately, flights have been temporarily suspended. However, they are still trying to maintain operations. The head office is also planning to temporarily move to Hankow due to the suspension of business in Shanghai. The Shanghai office on Nanking Road is still open to rent航务. Outside reports that all of the company's planes have been requisitioned by the government are not true.

### Report on the Anti-Enemy Support Association's National Salvation Donations

The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association's National Salvation Donations, received 95,141 yuan and 46 fen on the 11th, for a total of 410,766 yuan and 26 fen to date. Also, one thousand silver角, certificates of deposit totaling 278 yuan and 35 fen, for a total of 390 yuan and 57 fen to date. 5 Guangdong double毫, government bonds with a face value, received 200 yuan yesterday, for a total of 46,490 yuan to date. 8 pounds of English gold, 1 yuan and 16 cents of Japanese gold. Yesterday, the association also received 5,000 yuan in national salvation donations remitted by Wang Zhonghe from Tsinan through the Bank of China. The association, recognizing Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for saving the country and his generous donation, plans to submit a request to the National Government for an award.

### Adequate Water Supply Prepared in the International Settlement

The Shanghai Waterworks Company is now supplying tap water as usual to areas inside and adjacent to the International Settlement that have large water pipes installed, so that users have no fear of water outages. As for the quality of the water, it remains the same as before. The Chinese staff of the company are working as usual. If any large water pipes are damaged, the company will send staff to repair them at any time, so the water supply will not be cut off. However, the public must conserve water and not waste tap water. If water pipes are damaged and leaking, the waterworks company should be notified by telephone immediately to avoid wasting water. The company's water plants and branch plants have adequate defenses and protection, so the Municipal Council and the company believe that there is no fear of water outages within the Settlement. In the event that the company's machinery experiences difficulties, the Municipal Council has plans to borrow water from other sources. The families of the company's Chinese employees who originally lived in Yangshupu have been sent to the Western District, where the company has found accommodation for them. If users of tap water in the International Settlement find that the water supply is suddenly cut off, do not panic, as this situation may be caused by repair work.

### Correction

The following news items were published in the news column of this newspaper's morning edition yesterday: ⑴ Six or seven Japanese soldiers were found on the roof near North Honan Road and Haining Road and were fired upon by British soldiers with machine guns. ⑵ Over 900 enemy soldiers, overwhelmed by our army's pressure, surrendered their weapons to our side on Soochow Road and Honan Road in recent days. ⑶ When the Japanese warship "Sendai" in the Huangpu River held a summit meeting, it flew our national flag. After repeated investigations by this newspaper's reporters, it is confirmed that these incidents did not occur. We apologize for any misinformation.

### Fierce Battle on the Coastline of Woosung Lasted Day and Night

Enemy's Three Landing Attempts Repelled Head-on; Our Troops Fought Bravely, Enemy Casualties Exceeded Half; Scattered Remnants Still Being Searched For

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy's 2nd Division of reinforcements attempted to land at Zhang Huabang, Wenzaobang, Woosung, Lion Grove, Liuhe, Yanglinkou, etc., to attack our rear. Our army had prepared in advance and had very sufficient strength. From the late evening of the 21st, more than 40 enemy warships gathered outside the harbor and launched a fierce artillery attack on our various coastal ports, and dozens of planes aided in the battle, attempting to cover the landing of reinforcements. Our army responded calmly, firing back with heavy artillery on the one hand, and using hand grenades and machine guns in conjunction when the enemy approached the coast. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. After a night of fierce fighting, the enemy was finally repelled. On the night of the 22nd, the enemy attacked for the second time. The battle lasted until 2:00 AM yesterday morning. A portion of the enemy took advantage of the sparse artillery fire to sneak ashore, especially at Wenzaobang, Woosung, and Lion Grove. Our army adopted the main purpose of luring the enemy deep and annihilating them in one fell swoop. Taking advantage of the fact that the enemy's defensive positions had not yet been built, we launched a surprise attack with an encirclement formation. The enemy could not break through and corpses were everywhere. After a fierce battle until yesterday afternoon, all the enemy were cleared out. The remnants of the enemy fled in scattered directions, and our army searched in different directions. From 9:00 PM last night, the enemy launched three fierce attacks with all their strength from the land, sea, and air, desperately trying to land. Our army calmly responded and fought back with all its strength along the entire line. The fierce battle lasted for twelve hours without stopping. The enemy's deaths were over 6,000 or 7,000 people, and we also suffered considerable losses. As of 3:00 PM this afternoon, most of the enemy who landed had been eliminated, and the remaining ones were still fighting back in small groups.

### Enemy Brigade That Landed Completely Annihilated

Enemy Rushed Forward, Fighting Actively Despite High Casualties; Countless Drowned

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to official sources, the enemy's reinforcements have been taking the opportunity to land at various ports along the river, but because our side had prepared in advance, they were safe and sound. Until yesterday morning, before dawn, dozens of enemy warships, dragging small barges, were connected end to end in the Woosung estuary, carrying army troops to sneak across the river and land. At the same time, they used the air force to attack from above and below. The momentum was fierce, and it was unprecedented. Our side responded calmly, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, but they still rushed forward and fought actively despite high casualties. It is estimated that about one brigade of troops had sneaked ashore during the middle of the night. According to an official report, this group of enemy troops was repelled by our forces before 5:00 AM this morning (24th). The enemy suffered countless deaths and injuries, and countless drowned.

### Second Batch of Enemy Reinforcements Continues to Arrive

### Heavy Artillery Fire Outside Wusongkou

Ningbo Steamer Returns to Guotongsah and Anchors; Telegram to Shanghai Reports Fierce Fighting Continues

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) All Japanese warships stationed in Pujiang have sailed to assist in the battle outside Wusongkou. Two destroyers of the 23rd Squadron, originally anchored in front of the Japanese Post Office wharf, also sailed to Wusong this morning to join the battle. However, the enemy flagship "Izumo," anchored in front of the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf, remains in place. Around 6 AM this morning, the Taikoo Company's "New Beijing," the Sanpei Company's "Ningxing," and the Ewo Company's "Shenfu" arrived from Ningbo, carrying refugees to Ningbo. As the ships reached the Guotongsah waters, they encountered intense artillery fire from the enemy attacking Wusong, and our forces responded with heavy artillery, machine guns, and machine cannons, shaking the sea. The three ships attempted to sail to Shanghai but were hampered by the heavy artillery fire. Dozens of enemy aircraft also took off to assist in the battle, bombing Wusong. The three ships quickly retreated to the safety of Guotongsah and anchored, unable to proceed. At 11 AM, the three ships sent a telegram to Shanghai reporting that the fierce naval and air battle outside Wusongkou was still ongoing, with artillery and aircraft fully engaged. Stray bullets were flying across the sea, making it impossible to enter Wusong. They had no choice but to anchor in the Guotongsah waters and wait. Tens of thousands of refugees in Shanghai, waiting to board these three ships, are extremely anxious at the docks.

### Enemy Reinforcements Land and are Repelled

Our Forces Launch a Fierce Attack and Repel the Enemy by Noon; Relative Calm on Hongkou Front Lines This Morning

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) After the enemy reinforcements secretly landed last night, the center of the fighting in this city has shifted from Hongkou to Wusong. Therefore, the front lines in Hongkou were relatively quiet this morning. There was no intense contact along the Yuanfang Road and Zhaofeng Road lines. In the north, there was intermittent artillery fire in the Qiujiang Road area. Fierce street fighting continued around the Xihui Road and Huade Road areas. At 9:30 AM this morning, another group of enemy reinforcements desperately landed at Wusong, their numbers unknown. Both sides' aircraft also engaged in fierce aerial battles in the area, covering their respective troops. After a fierce attack by our forces, the enemy was repelled by noon today, with many falling into the water.

### Artillery Battles Break Out Again in Pudong

Intended to Restrain Our Military Strength; Our Military Authorities Were Aware of Their Treachery

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) At 1:20 PM today, our forces and enemy warships in the Pudong area engaged in an artillery battle, but it stopped in less than half an hour, followed by silence. This was because all enemy warships had sailed upstream to assist in the battle, with the focus of the fighting having shifted to the Wusong area. However, at 10:10 AM, enemy warships resumed a fierce artillery battle with our forces in the Pudong area, exchanging fire for three-quarters of an hour before gradually stopping. According to military experts, the enemy warships have been behaving erratically in recent days, partly to avoid being targeted by our artillery and partly to harass our Pudong area with sporadic artillery fire, intending to restrain a portion of our military strength. However, our military authorities were aware of their treachery, and their cunning will have no effect.

Another dispatch reports that around 5 AM this morning, our garrison in Pudong again engaged in a fierce artillery battle with enemy warships. The roaring artillery fire awakened residents within the special zone from their dreams. Reporters, climbing to high vantage points, saw flashes of fire and heard the whistling of artillery shells. The explosions sounded like thunder, shaking buildings. The intense fighting lasted for over an hour before gradually subsiding. Inquiries made by reporters to military authorities this morning revealed that enemy warships had repeatedly attempted to land in Pudong, but after being repelled by our forces, they continuously shelled Pudong indiscriminately, evidently seeking to vent their anger by destroying our positions. However, our defenses are solid, and we are responding appropriately, so there has been no damage.

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Enemy aircraft, aware that our air defenses in the Nanshi area are exceptionally complete and that they are at risk of being shot down by our forces at any time, have greatly reduced the number of aircraft over Nanshi today. Even when one or two planes do fly over, they fly at a very high altitude, concealed in the clouds, almost invisible to the naked eye.

These prove that the training and accumulation of the past few years have not been in vain. Compared to previous battles, there has been significant progress, which even the enemy cannot deny. However, we must pay close attention to the fact that the struggle has only just begun, and future developments are uncertain. We must, in this continuous struggle, further strengthen the organization and training of the national populace through practical needs and experience. The accumulation of material resources must also be further increased. We firmly believe that this is what we must do and what we can do, because we are determined to die for our cause. No threat or danger can disturb our resolve. We must concentrate the nation's heart, strength, and resources on this one point, turning it into a raging fire to incinerate the enemy's aggressive ambitions." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 23rd)

### Foreigners Arriving in Shanghai from Japan Talk About What They Witnessed En Route

Japanese People Very Uneasy About Shanghai War; Witnessed Killings at Osaka Docks

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," a foreigner who recently returned from Japan to avoid the war told a representative of the newspaper this morning (23rd) that the Japanese people are very uneasy about the prolonged war in and around Shanghai. The country is now mobilizing the first batch of reservists and collecting war funds door-to-door. There are no special military activities in Nagasaki, but temporary residences have been built along the coast to accommodate people returning from Taiwan. Several submarines were seen offshore of Goto Island, as well as occasional destroyer squadrons patrolling the sea. After entering the Huangpu River, thick smoke was seen over Shanghai, and many Japanese warships were anchored in the river, one of which was an old aircraft carrier. A Chinese steamship was then seen anchored between two destroyers for two days, evidently under inspection. Passing Wusong, not a single person was seen, only a dog emerging from a dilapidated house, looking weak and lifeless. The fish market, Qiujiang Wharf, Zhabei Waterworks, shells and debris, Asiatic Oil's Yangshupu oil machine, and the NYK warehouse in Pudong were still burning. At the Osaka merchant docks, an extremely cruel incident was witnessed. The ship's purser said that the attackers were very active, so everyone was ordered to stay in their cabins. However, I saw six Chinese men being stabbed repeatedly with bayonets, then hacked with knives, and finally shot with pistols. The horror was truly shocking.

### Defenses of Both Concessions Strengthened

British Troops Build Sandbag Forts; French Troops Expected Tonight

British troops stationed in the northern district of the International Settlement are quickly dismantling the sandbags piled up in important areas, such as the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and the boundary road, the intersection of Elgin Road, the intersection of Haining Road, the intersection of Kaifeng Road and Haining Road, and the intersection of North Henan Road and Baoshan Road. They are expanding the scope of the fortifications and using sandbags as the main material, building structures resembling small houses. The roofs are flat, and the sides have gun slits, allowing soldiers stationed in nearby temporary barracks to move into the sandbag houses. Therefore, the British troops stationed in the Qianjiang Public Hall on Wenzhao Shi Road and the empty building behind the First Special District Court, which served as temporary barracks, have already moved into the sandbag forts yesterday and will eat and sleep there. They will not move beyond the fortifications unless there is a change of guard or a retreat.

After the outbreak of war in Shanghai, the French government, in order to protect the lives and property of French residents in the French Concession, ordered all French troops stationed in Shanghai to mobilize and also transferred two battalions of infantry, about 1,000 men, from Annam aboard the Lamarck gunboat to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai tonight. The French authorities have already designated the church school on Old Sépaul Road and the Sino-French School at Eight Immortals Bridge on Rue Massenet as the barracks for the two battalions. Workers have been hired to set up beds and dining halls, and Chinese will be contracted to provide food. The soldiers of the two battalions remain under the command of General Brigger.

According to the Shanghai Times, reliable sources say that the French authorities are planning to transfer a large detachment of troops from the colonies to Shanghai. The first batch is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Haiphong tomorrow (24th), and the second batch is expected to arrive within about a week. Therefore, the French garrison in this city will be increased by about a thousand men, with the first batch consisting of about 1,200 men.

### Brief Comments

— Appearance

Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota will invite leaders of various political parties and representatives of the House of Peers to a cabinet meeting on August 23rd and 24th. He will explain the reasons why the Japanese government has had no choice but to adopt a military plan against the Nanjing government. Some say that it is too late for Foreign Minister Hirota to explain the reasons at this time. However, what are the reasons he will give? What is meant by "no choice"? We would like to hear the details.

Hu Shih-tse, our country's minister to Switzerland, has stated that our country will no longer rely on the League of Nations. Indeed, during the September 18th Incident, our country did try to rely on the League of Nations, but it was ineffective. What is the point of relying on it again now? As the saying goes, "If you want to avenge yourself, you must do it yourself." This applies to individuals, and even more so to countries. We can only rely on ourselves for self-help and survival. As Zeng Guofan said, we can only "dig in firmly and fight to the death." Let us put aside all words and dismiss all thoughts for now.

### Suzhou After the Outbreak of the Shanghai Battle

Extreme Tension on All Sides, Unscrupulous Merchants Attacked by Youth

Suzhou Correspondence: At the beginning of the Shanghai battle, land and water transportation in Suzhou were slightly inconvenienced due to military transportation. Regular passenger ships and ferries continued to operate, but schedules and frequencies were uncertain. Land-based buses, except for the Suzhou-Kunshan road, continued to operate as usual on all other routes. As for trains, they could not depart on time, so passengers were extremely crowded, and luggage piled up at the stations. Telegraph services, however, remained normal.

In terms of security, the police bureau has increased defenses during this extraordinary period and does not allow leave. Pedestrians are checked at night to prevent the activities of traitors. In addition, military, government, and police authorities have organized military support inspection offices, dispatching patrol teams for constant surveillance. Italian troops stationed in Suzhou are also deployed for patrol. Personnel from people's organizations and Baojia chiefs who have been called up will form a rear service office, starting organization on the 15th, to assist the police in maintaining security.

Regarding finance, the county chamber of commerce has repeatedly consulted with merchants in the silver and money industries, and preparations have been made. After the news that Shanghai's banks and financial institutions were ordered to close for two days spread, the banks immediately held a meeting and decided to slightly restrict payments from the 14th onwards. Except for military relief funds, which will be paid as usual, each depositor is limited to withdrawing 200 yuan per household. All banks will operate as usual, which is very stable, and the copper coin frenzy has also subsided.

The party and government authorities are making efforts to advance relief efforts. The Red Cross and the relief committee have formed a rescue team of more than 400 people, and Ye Zhongliang has been appointed as the captain. The stretcher team has also started working, with about 200 people. Starting from the 15th, they have been carrying medicines to the front line. The Jinghu Garrison Headquarters held an inspection of the rescue team and stretcher team at the stadium. 50,000 yuan was borrowed from various banks for rescue expenses.

Regarding food and fuel, which are particularly important, according to the grain industry, Suzhou has sufficient rice reserves, enough for three months. Moreover, new rice has already entered the market, so there is no problem. As for fuel, in addition to rice straw supplied by villagers, coal is slightly insufficient. The Chamber of Commerce, the County Government, and the Coal Industry Association are trying to purchase it from other places to meet needs. Other daily necessities will be handled by the Price Assessment Committee organized by the Chamber of Commerce.

In society, a small number of residents are moving to the countryside. The Jianting Xishan District Office has specially formulated measures due to the large number of people going to the mountains. Those who move to the mountains are limited to women and children, and adult men are still ordered to return to the city. Each household must bring one dan of white rice and two jin of salt to avoid panic. Theaters are still operating as usual, and there is no panic.

The Anti-Japanese Support Association is conducting the "One Yuan to Save the Country" campaign. The fundraising team of the association, due to the tense situation, has begun to raise donations to save the country, aiming for 200,000 yuan. It is being carried out separately by various trade associations, industrial guilds, rental houses, and others. A meeting was held on the 15th to discuss the measures.

The Wan Hengxing Porcelain Shop outside Changmen Hanging Bridge, established by Wang Donglin, a Jiangbei native who once worked for the Japanese company Hino Yoko in Shanghai, was visited by many young people around 7 pm on the 12th. They distributed slogans warning unscrupulous merchants and destroyed some of the goods. The store immediately closed down voluntarily. In addition, the Dalu Machinery Factory was found to be transporting enemy goods and was destroyed by patriotic youth on the 14th. On the 14th, hundreds of refugees arrived at the station, supporting the old and carrying the young, all arriving by train from Nanxiang and Taicang. The Red Cross and the Relief Committee are trying to settle them down. According to the refugees, on the evening of the 13th, a loud sound was heard outside the North Gate of Taicang, and two shells landed in the countryside.

### Study of the Tragedy of the Falling Bomb on Nanjing Road Yesterday Afternoon

All Parties Unanimously Acknowledge it as a Bomb Dropped by an Aircraft, Yellow Lines on the Bomb Not Used by Our Army

Bomb Research

(Special Report from This Newspaper) The tragedy of the bomb falling on the Xianshi Company yesterday afternoon, with many deaths and injuries, has attracted the attention of all parties as to whether this stray bullet was an aircraft bomb or an artillery shell. In addition to the Xianshi Company, there was another bullet that landed behind the American naval depot on Sichuan Road, but it did not explode. The one at Xianshi Company has already exploded, so investigations and research from all parties are mostly concentrated on the unexploded bullet at the naval depot. According to research by military experts from all parties, it is believed that it was undoubtedly a bomb dropped by an aircraft. The concession authorities will report the research results to the consular corps and then decide how to deal with it.

The bomb at Xianshi Company, after research, is similar to the one at the naval depot, but slightly shorter. The diameter of the bottom of the bomb is about 18 inches, and the height is about 4 feet. The weight of this bomb is estimated to be about 1,000 pounds, so the theory of it being an artillery shell is impossible. At the same time, British and American artillery experts have carefully studied the unexploded bomb at the depot and unanimously believe that it is undoubtedly an aerial bomb. Moreover, the unexploded bomb also has several characters that look like Chinese but are not actually Chinese. There are three yellow lines on the bomb. Yellow is not the color used by our army, while our country's bombs are all red. At the time of the incident, there was no activity of our air force in the concession or Pudong, but at that time, several Japanese aircraft were witnessed circling over the public concession. As for this unexploded bomb, it was once displayed at the Central Police Station and has now been transferred to the custody of the American naval authorities.

Traffic Restored

(Special Report from This Newspaper) After the tragedy at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road yesterday, after the rapid rescue by the public concession police, the British army, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the fire brigade, and the scout team, it was cleaned up last night, and the road surface was also repaired. Traffic has been fully restored since 5 am this morning. Additional police have been dispatched to maintain traffic at the intersection. Business at Xianshi and Yong'an has been completely suspended. Nearby Xinxin and Daxin are open as usual. The shattered glass windows of Xianshi and Yong'an have been nailed with wooden boards. The interior of Xianshi and Yong'an reportedly suffered heavy losses. The Dongya Restaurant on the third floor was completely destroyed, and the bullet penetrated to the second floor, so the third floor also suffered significant losses, and the bottom floor was also震毀. The losses of Yong'an were unexpected. At that time, in addition to the deaths and injuries of customers and staff in the store, from the ground floor to the fourth floor, the damage was very severe. As for the statistics of all the deaths and injuries yesterday, there were 175 deaths and 475 injuries. Minor injuries and those who went home with minor injuries at the time are not included.

In addition, the Public Works Department announced the following estimates of the number of deaths and injuries in the Nanjing Road tragedy from 6 pm on August 25 to 10 am on August 24: 169 deaths, 535 injuries. Xianshi, Yong'an, and nearby buildings suffered heavy losses. The deaths and injuries of foreigners are as follows: Deaths: Mr. Bornaner, Swiss, and Mr. Eggert, German; Injuries: Mr. Beringer, American, Mr. Simmers, Mr. Cranston, and Ms. Diana. The deaths and injuries of police officers are as follows: Deaths: Indian Constable No. 54, and Chinese Constables No. 1051 and No. 2000; Seriously injured: Indian Sergeant No. 352, and Chinese Constables No. 1438, No. 2843, No. 2849, and No. 2656; Slightly injured: One Chinese Police Inspector, Chinese Sergeant No. 1571, and Chinese Constables No. 206, No. 249, and No. 1262.

### Public Works Department Protects the Resumption of Business of Shops

Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, previously in order to encourage the resumption of business of various shops, had published an announcement in the newspaper and sent a letter to the Public Works Department for protection. Now, the reply letter from the Public Works Department states: "Replying directly, we have received your letter of August 16 regarding the request for our department to protect the resumption of business of various shops. After reading it, we have learned that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the police stations under the department are now working closely together to ensure internal security. Our department will do our best to protect the operation of shops. We intend to ask your association to notify all parties concerned that if they encounter any slight threat, they can notify the nearby police station or the Volunteer Corps on duty, or call the Central Police Station at 15380, and they will provide appropriate assistance. We hereby reply accordingly for your information."

### Difficulties in Rescuing Refugees

Public Works Department Prevents Refugees from Returning to the Concession, the Benevolent General Association Has Negotiated and Obtained a Solution, Hoping That All Sectors Will Find Ways to Send Refugees Back to Their Hometowns

The Relief Committee of the Shanghai Charity Federation for Disaster Relief has recently reported that vehicles rescuing refugees have been stopped by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and are not allowed to enter the concession. Yu Xianling, the director of the negotiation department of the association, negotiated with the Public Works Department. According to police authorities, since the outbreak of the war, the number of residents in the concession has increased sharply, and there are tens of thousands of refugees. Not only is it hindering life, but there will also be a food panic. Therefore, unless a large number of refugees are sent to other ports, the concession cannot accommodate them anymore. Even the hospitals no longer accept them. Even if the hospitals have vacancies, they can only be used for residents in the concession who are sick or injured. After lengthy negotiations, there was no solution. Later, with the help of the Deputy Director of the Bureau, He De, a remedy was obtained. If a new refugee hospital is established and well-organized, after the Public Works Department sends personnel to investigate and deem it qualified and submits it to the Chief Superintendent for approval and issuance of a pass, then the rescue agencies will be notified to transport patients to the hospital according to the quota. Therefore, what is urgently needed now is a refugee hospital. It is hoped that all sectors will quickly organize it. At the same time, it is hoped that various charitable organizations will find ways to send refugees in the concession back to their hometowns, so that refugees trapped in the war zone can still be rescued and resettled.

In addition, after the Concession authorities announced martial law, permits were issued for travel. This was to facilitate the entry and exit of legitimate workers. However, some people who do not cherish themselves use this as a talisman to go out shopping late at night and even go out with prostitutes. Therefore, the Public Works Department has now refused to issue permits, so many people serving formal agencies and handling relief work cannot receive them. This is actually affected by those who are not good.

### Chamber of Commerce Representative Presents Binoculars to Zhang Fakui

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in view of General Zhang Fakui's participation in the Anti-Japanese War and his bravery in killing the enemy, specially sent representative Chen Xiaodie to pay tribute and present binoculars. The original letter stated: "To Commander Xianghua, the fierce bandits have invaded our territory, and our army has held the dangers and faced the river, as steep as mountains. The old reputation has long stripped the barbarian soul, and the new order is as strict as a god. We and others are inspired by loyalty and anger, and each rises up to fight. In addition to sending a representative to express our condolences, we specially present a pair of binoculars, so that you can open your divine eyes and win a victory thousands of miles away, stripping the Japanese souls so that they have nowhere to hide. With respect, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."

### People's Food Association Dreges Inland Rice Grain

Electing the Suzhou Financial Hall to Purchase 3,000 Dan of Rice, the Municipal People's Food Adjustment Committee, in order to dredge the source of inland rice grain, so that the people of Shanghai can be continuously assisted, specially telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Finance to order 3,000 dan of rice from the local production area to be transported to Shanghai for assistance. The Provincial Department authorities have now purchased from local merchants and will transport it to Shanghai in the next few days. In addition, the purchasing team organized by the People's Food Association has drafted detailed measures for the exploration and handling by the Director of the Committee, Gu Xinyi, and will be sent to various provinces and counties after being approved by the committee to actively help and dispatch ships to depart for procurement.

### The Rescue Committee Continues to Send Refugees Out of the Border

And Dispatch Personnel to Follow the Boat and Provide Protection

The Municipal Relief Committee, in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai, has been sending them to Songjiang, Hangzhou, and Suzhou through the dispatch team for several days, reaching more than 10,000 people. The team dispatches personnel to accompany the boats and vehicles to the destination, handing them over to the local municipal and county governments and local charitable organizations for accommodation, and then transferring them back to their hometowns. In addition, in order to facilitate the various hometown associations to hire their own boats or vehicles to send refugees, the team has specially requested the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters to issue permits. If the various hometown associations wish to obtain them, they can contact Shao Xubai, the dispatcher of the Pudong Hometown Association.

### The Refugee Maternity Hospital is Established

Since the brutal Japanese invasion of Shanghai, homes have been turned into ruins. People in Zhabei, Hongkou, and surrounding areas have been displaced and have no home to return to. Moreover, there are many pregnant women waiting to give birth, moaning and weeping in the wind and rain, which is extremely miserable. Some enthusiastic people and doctors in this city, seeing this situation, took pity on them and borrowed the address of the Life Elementary School at 1085 Gordon Road in the British Concession to establish the "Shanghai Refugee Maternity Hospital." It was established a few days ago and has 100 beds. At present, many people have been sent from various accommodation sites. The first maternity patient gave birth to a son the night before last, which was extremely successful. The hospital is completely voluntary and does not charge any fees.

### This Year's Students Studying in the United States Have a Scheduled Departure Date

More than 100 students studying in the United States this year were originally divided into seven batches to go abroad. However, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, various shipping companies have been dramaizing the expatriates in the country, resulting in no departure. The students gathered at the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge a few days ago and decided to elect representatives Cheng Xikang and others to negotiate with all parties. From now on, registration will be held at the association in order to jointly solve the problem. More than 100 people have registered and are still continuing to register. As a result of the negotiations by the representatives and the efforts of all parties, the Dollar Company has agreed to send two ships, the President Hoover and the President McKinley, to Shanghai around the 30th of this month to provide for the students to go to the United States. Detailed information and measures, in addition to being announced daily at the YMCA, will also be reported to the public and discussed at the YMCA at 9 am on the 25th of this month.

### The Adventure of the Swiss Siblings on the Battlefield

The North China Daily News reported that on Friday afternoon, two Swiss expatriates, Ju Faner and his sister, ventured to Yangshupu to inspect goods stored in a warehouse near Zhaofeng Road. They did not return until Saturday. The Swiss Deputy Consul General once took two armored vehicles of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and ventured into the Yangshupu war zone to search for them, but returned empty-handed. It is now known that the two spent the night in the warehouse on Friday, when bombs were falling around them, which was extremely dangerous. On Saturday, they left the warehouse and sought a way to enter the Chinese army's front line. They met a Chinese officer who was very amiable. In the evening, they walked to the downtown area and then to Zhenru. On Sunday morning, they safely returned to the concession.

The two were treated with courtesy in the Chinese army. In addition to food, they were also provided with cigarettes and even black military uniforms were added to their bodies, because the two were wearing white clothes, which were easy for the enemy to notice at night and shoot at. The care was extremely careful, so the two were deeply grateful. The Chinese soldiers told the two that they had received orders from their superiors to treat all foreigners with friendship. The Swiss Consul General thanked Mayor Yu after hearing that the two had returned safely.

### Residents Sweep in Front of Their Doors and Pay Attention to Cleanliness of Roads

The French Municipal Council notified residents to pay attention to the cleanliness of roads, stating: "For the purpose of notification, all residents in this concession must work together with the Public Health Bureau to maintain the maximum cleanliness of all roads, sidewalks, and alleys. All residents should wash and sweep the sidewalks or alleys in front of their houses, and all property owners must order their doormen to maintain the cleanliness of the alleys. This is announced."

### Greek Women Comfort the Chinese Army

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai on August 13, women from the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries have rushed to leave Shanghai. In fact, the Chinese army is disciplined and well-trained. While they are giving a heavy blow to the invaders, they are doing their best to protect the lives and property of expatriates from all countries. To avoid danger, some should avoid dangerous situations. Now, some Greek women living in Shanghai express their sympathy for our country's self-defense against strong enemies, and they do not agree with the British and American women fleeing in panic. Not only are they unwilling to leave Shanghai, but also, at the beginning of the war, Mrs. T.V. Vlachos (translated sound) Wei Han Xishu prepared various items to send to the Chinese soldiers. Feeling that one person's help was limited, they now united Greek expatriates to establish a Shanghai Greek Women's Help Chinese Soldiers Association. The office is located at 244 Zhao Zhujiao Road in the French Concession. The directors (G. Paradissis D. Chelmis V. Castro) are actively working hard to prepare various items and send them to Chinese relief agencies in batches, entrusted to be transferred to the front. It is hoped that our country's women will rise up in response and organize the same way, concentrate financial and material resources to help the soldiers fighting the enemy for national self-defense. It is believed that there will be many items lacking at the front, and if the women's world gets enthusiastic assistance, the effect will not be small.

### Conversation With a Wounded Soldier

— Ping

"If the ones in front die, the ones behind take over!" Everyone Bravely Takes the Lead in Besieging the Japanese Headquarters

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Since the Anti-Japanese War started, our army has been progressing almost every day. According to friends returning from the front, the fighting brothers are all unafraid of death and brave to take the lead. They have a slogan: "If the ones in front die, the ones behind take over!" Before the war started, many people doubted that China could not fight Japan. Those with this "fear of Japan" can now wake up from their dreams.

Yesterday's newspaper reported that a machine gunner who lost his left hand refused to listen to the doctor's advice, insisted on leaving the hospital after applying medicine, and said: "I am a machine gunner, only my right hand is used, and my left hand is useless at all." How should we in the rear pay tribute to this hero who is fighting for holiness!

Today, the reporter also specially went to a rear hospital. After the director learned of my intention, he told me very kindly that there were more than 20 wounded soldiers living in the hospital, all with minor injuries; and he allowed my request and led me to the sick bay. At this time, a women's comfort team brought many cigarettes, bread, fruits, etc. and talked with the brothers. They were very grateful for the condolences from the compatriots in the rear. They said that living in the hospital was very comfortable. The director introduced me to a brother who could now walk around in the ward - he was injured the night the headquarters were being attacked.

He welcomed me to talk to him, and said: "This victory is due to the whole country's determination to resist the enemy. Our brothers are just standing on the front line. I am very grateful to all the ladies for taking the trouble to bring so much stuff to us, and to the gentlemen for coming to talk to us. Now, my injuries will soon be healed, and I will continue to do my last bit of strength. For our compatriots, our country!"

The reporter saw that he was too excited, so I asked him to be quiet and tell me more about the situation of attacking the Japanese headquarters that night.

He seemed to hesitate for a moment. The reporter knew what he meant and said with a smile:

"I know, anything that can't be published will definitely not be written in the newspaper."

He nodded and began to tell me about the situation of the general attack order that night:

"Around four o'clock in the morning that day, we received an order from our superiors to launch a general attack, but because the enemy's front line was too close, artillery and rifles were completely useless. We could only confront them with machine gun teams. I was a light machine gunner. After receiving the order, we bravely advanced forward. The enemy's machine guns also swept at us at the same time. The bullets whizzed over our heads and ears.

"This continued for several hours, and the enemy gradually retreated. But their machine guns never stopped firing. They retreated a few steps and then set them up to fire, and after firing for a while, they retreated again. We naturally advanced forward. The bullets flew over us like heavy rain, but our brothers went crazy to defend against the past."

"When we were close to the headquarters, I got hit..."

As he spoke, he pointed to his head and neck wrapped in linen cloth and showed me, "I got three machine gun bullets here, but I didn't feel any pain at the time, it just felt like I was being poured with ice water on my head and neck, we still went forward to defend, and finally approached the headquarters and surrounded it.

"This time," he pondered for a moment, "both sides had deaths, but the exact number is not known. It is glorious to die on the battlefield, I only got three bullets..." In other words, there seemed to be a sense of "better to die than live".

The reporter thought that we had talked too much, and that he must be mentally exhausted, so I thanked her and asked him to rest. But he shook his head, indicating that the wound on his head and neck was completely healed.

On the way out, I also told him that the army in my fight had advanced to the Shanghai Grand Theater area on North Sichuan Road. This news aroused the brothers on the other sickbeds, and they all smiled, which was an indescribable situation.
