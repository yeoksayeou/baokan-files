### Japanese Residents in Tianjin Request Reduction of Troops in North China

[Tianjin] Since the expansion of the Japanese Garrison in North China in July last year, the budget has increased to 18 million yuan.

### The Situation of the Balearic Islands

— Translated by Chu Yukun

Foreign Affairs

For centuries, the Balearic Islands have occupied an important strategic position in the Mediterranean Sea, and recently, due to Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and the civil war in Spain, the balance of power in the Mediterranean has changed, and this has once again become a focus of global attention.

The Balearic Islands (Balearic Islands for short—translator) are of no economic importance. The area is only 2,000 square miles, the population is only 350,000, and there are no precious mineral fruits and vegetables. Although they are considered abundant and welcomed by Britain and Germany, it is definitely not worth using war to seize the Balearic Islands. However, they are of international importance because the military ports of the Balearic Islands are scattered between France and its North Africa, and on the sea route of the British Empire from Gibraltar through Malta Suez to India.

The easternmost part of the Balearic Islands, Minorca, was first occupied by Britain in the 18th century. Britain's reason for seizing Minorca was entirely due to strategic relations. The main city of Minorca is Port Mahon, an impregnable good harbor that is easy to defend and difficult to attack. Britain's loss of the port in 1803 was not a major loss for Britain itself, because Britain had occupied a better port, Malta, in 1799, and developed it as Britain's base in the eastern Mediterranean. Apart from Minorca once being owned by Britain, the Balearic Islands initially belonged to the rule of Aragon after expelling the Moors from the Middle Ages, and later became part of Spain. When the leaders of the separatist movement were active in Barcelona, they tried to unite the Balearic Islands to form a "Greater Catalonia." Although most of the people of the Balearic Islands speak the Catalan language, when the Spanish Republican government allowed Catalonia to become an autonomous government, it did not include the Balearic Islands in Catalonia.

Since the Balearic Islands lie in the center of the traffic route between France and its North African colonies, the French government has tried its best to maintain friendly relations with the Spanish government, and the main reason is this. For the same reason, in order to protect the safety of the route to India, Britain has always opposed Spain's cession of the Balearic Islands to a third country. It is also generally believed that when the last world war broke out, London had concluded an agreement with Madrid, so the British navy could borrow Port Mahon as its naval base. If Italy participated in the war in the Central European Group, Paris was once alarmed by unofficial news a few years ago, saying that Spain's Primo de Rivera had allowed Mussolini to borrow the Balearic Islands as its base in certain emergency situations; only after the establishment of the Spanish Republican government in 1931, this agreement ended without any result. The Spanish government authorities, in view of the strategic importance of the Balearic Islands, have also made great efforts in recent years to enhance their defense projects. Gil Robles, the Minister of Military Affairs in 1935, who is one of the leaders of the Spanish rebels today, cannot be said to have not worked hard in the Balearic Islands.

The sudden rise of Fascist Italy and its complete reliance on its special rights in the Balearic Islands have made it one of the world's naval powers. Britain has suffered enough humiliation from Mussolini, who unscrupulously attacked East Africa, and in fact, Britain no longer considers the route to India to be safe. Similarly, if Italy has really obtained the right to use the island as a base for its naval and air forces, it has become a risky act for France to freely obtain grain and manpower supplies from its North African colonies.

Under the current situation, the western Mediterranean is almost completely controlled by the Italian air force based in La Spezia and La Maddalena. If Italy obtains a base in the Balearic Islands, France will have to use the circuitous Atlantic route as its traffic route for its North and South African territories. Therefore, once a Fascist government is established in Spain, no matter whether Italy illegally occupies the Balearic Islands or not, if Fascist Spain allows Fascist Italy to borrow Port Mahon, Palma, and its islands in the event of a war between Italy and France, it will be the most dangerous thing for France. In other words, Italian Volonteers are being sent to Spain, and according to Eden's report in the House of Commons on November 30, it seems that they have unofficially occupied the Balearic Islands. Although it is unofficial, its effect is the same.

The responsible leaders of the Spanish rebel government have repeatedly denied rumors that they have allowed the Balearic Islands to be ceded to Italy or other countries. From the perspective of the Spanish people's love of national glory—which was not broken by Napoleon—it is questionable whether there will be a political system that would disregard everything and cede the national legacy to others. Therefore, at most, they can only allow the great powers to purchase the necessary army, navy, and air force privileges when necessary in wartime.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Significance and Impact of the British Defense White Paper

— Li

In a world shrouded in the clouds of war, with great powers frantically expanding their armaments, the British Cabinet has published a White Paper outlining an ambitious defense plan to be completed within five years. This is certainly not accidental. Since the Labour Party Cabinet fell in 1931 and the Conservative Party regained power, Britain has been caught in a whirlwind of arms competition. The Italo-Abyssinian War broke out the year before last, and the British Conservative Cabinet felt even more compelled to expand its armaments, announcing an expansion plan in March of last year. However, this plan was not implemented for long before Germany abandoned the Locarno Treaties, marched into the Rhineland, and extended the term of military service. Meanwhile, the United States and Japan, after the expiration of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, were also intensifying their defenses in the Pacific. Under these circumstances, Britain had no choice but to strengthen its expansion plan. The publication of this Defense Plan White Paper signals to the world that Britain is determined not to lag behind in the international arms race.

The stated purpose of this expansion, according to Conservative Party members, is to maintain world peace. The White Paper states, "The territories of Great Britain are widely distributed, and the supplies needed by the country from overseas must be transported by sea. All of this underscores the need to emphasize the British military. The Navy must maintain the safety of transportation, and its responsibility is particularly important. The modernization of the defenses of militarily important locations in the British Empire is also one of the most important aspects of the defense plan." This further demonstrates Britain's determination to safeguard the interests of its colonies scattered around the world. However, everyone knows that an arms race can easily lead to war. Whether Britain can stop this dangerous trend is a big question.

According to the White Paper, the cost of Britain's military expansion within five years is estimated to be £150 million. The burden of this huge expenditure will undoubtedly fall on the broad masses of British taxpayers. Therefore, when this plan was discussed in the House of Commons, Labour Party members strongly opposed it, arguing that it would only increase the burden on the people and was not timely. Under the current circumstances, although this plan is likely to be passed in the House of Commons with the support of Conservative Party members, it will probably be difficult to win the sincere support of the majority of the public.

Moreover, military expansion is contagious. The military expansion of country A will lead to the military expansion of country B, and the military expansion of country B will lead to the military expansion of country C. The withdrawal of troops from countries B and C will in turn lead to the re-withdrawal of troops from country A. The current British troop withdrawal can be said to be the result of troop withdrawals by other countries to some extent, but this will in turn lead to further troop withdrawals by other countries. Now that the British Defense Plan White Paper has just been published, Germany has put forward demands for the same rights, the Japanese Navy is also preparing to catch up quickly, and Italy is rumored to be proposing a large-scale defense plan at the Supreme Fascist Council to be held on March 1. In this way, as the armaments of the great powers expand in a cause-and-effect manner, the world's most terrible disasters are sure to come.

### British Naval Expansion, the United States Not Willing to Fall Behind

Believing that British and American forces do not conflict, hoping that Britain will increase its strength in the Pacific

[Washington] After learning that Britain plans to start building three battleships, two aircraft carriers, and several cruisers on April 1, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy told reporters today that if other countries increase their naval strength beyond the limits of existing treaties, the United States may follow suit. However, he also solemnly stated that he is not qualified to express opinions on Britain's plan on behalf of the State Department or the Navy Department; he only knows that the policy of the United States is never to allow the United States Navy to be inferior to that of any country. At the same time, other naval officers generally believe that a strong British Navy is a stabilizing force, especially in the Pacific. Some even believe that the United States welcomes Britain's increase in military power in the Pacific. Admiral Leahy also said that maintaining equal strength between the United States and Britain is only a matter of policy and should not be regarded as a sign of any conflict between Britain and the United States.

[Washington] The British government announced its National Defense Program White Paper yesterday, which includes a naval shipbuilding plan. It is learned that the US government does not intend to order another naval shipbuilding plan to compete with Britain, because the government believes that the funds listed in the US naval budget for 1937 are sufficient to modernize the navy, and there is also a shortage of steel needed for shipbuilding.

### British Sea Phase Explains Shipbuilding in Various Countries

Soviet Russia Participates in Submarine Convention

[London] Secretary of the Sea Hall replied to questions in the House of Commons today, saying that the number of cruisers with eight-inch caliber artillery positions that have been built and are being built by the great powers is as follows: Britain 15 ships, the United States 18 ships, Japan 12 ships, France and Italy 7 ships each, and Germany 3 ships. Hall also said that he would like to take this opportunity to state that the recent report that British cruisers of this type have lost their dominant position is not credible. (Central News Agency, London, Reuters, 17th)

[London] The naval treaty signed by Britain, France, and the United States on March 25 of last year has a protocol on the humanization of submarine warfare. This protocol was signed by Britain, France, the United States, Italy, Germany, Japan, and other countries on November 6 of last year. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky recently sent a note to British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Vansittart, stating that the Soviet government is also willing to sign and join this protocol. According to the protocol on the humanization of submarine warfare, its provisions are the same as those contained in the Washington Naval Treaty, stating that in wartime, submarines must first place all crew members and passengers of any merchant ship in a safe zone before sinking or damaging them. (17th Havas Electric)

### US Neutrality Act

Amendments to the Proposal

[Washington] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator Pittman, has temporarily revised the permanent neutrality bill he proposed. The bill stipulates: ㊀ Prohibit lending money or supplying arms to warring factions in international wars or civil wars; ㊁ Other goods cannot be exported until ownership has been transferred from Americans to foreign buyers; ㊂ US merchant ships must not be armed, and US citizens must not travel on ships of belligerent nations. All provisions will automatically take effect when the president declares that a state of war exists, authorizing the president to prohibit US ships from carrying any goods that could endanger the peace of the United States at will.

### England Expands Military Preparedness to Safeguard World Peace

Chancellor of the Exchequer Explains the Purpose to Parliament; Labor and Liberal Parties Express Criticism

[London] Yesterday in Parliament, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain vigorously defended the government's proposed £400 million national defense loan, responding to criticism from the Labor and Liberal parties. Chamberlain declared that the purpose of this loan was to maintain peace. The British Empire's efforts towards peace, and its determination not to use force for aggression, were understandable to all. Moreover, Britain's efforts to maintain peace were not only for itself but also for all nations of the world. The British government, based on past experience, deeply understood that Britain's power and its military strength were closely related. Therefore, today's British military strength, being constantly improved, was a factor in stabilizing the international political situation and a mainstay of world peace.

Parliamentary debate, which began after Chamberlain proposed the national defense loan, was to conclude today. The first to voice dissent against the government's plan to spend £1.5 billion on defense over five years was Lawrence, a former Secretary to the Treasury in the Upper House Cabinet. Lawrence criticized the key points of the White Paper, arguing that there was no well-considered connection between the government's defense plan and its foreign policy, especially its foreign policy related to the ideal of collective security. Furthermore, the defense plan proposed in the White Paper did not demonstrate any real adjustment measures, and there was a lack of conceptual or formal consideration of effective defense measures in important military matters. Lawrence declared that the Labor Party opposed the resolution because it sought to impose this huge burden on the entire population not through appropriate taxation but through borrowing, which would inflate prices and make it most difficult for those least able to bear it.

Liberal Party member Sir Sinclair spoke next, stating that the Liberal Party was closely scrutinizing the budget. However, it would support the military preparations necessary for defense and peace. He stated that although the military buildup of certain European countries carried a moral responsibility, in his personal opinion, it should be borne by the victorious nations of the post-World War I policies. However, Britain truly felt compelled and had no other path to follow. Nevertheless, Sinclair considered the borrowing plan to be economically unwise in the current environment of commercial recovery, and he questioned whether it was possible to prevent unscrupulous profiteering.

When Chamberlain proposed the national defense loan, Labor Party member Attlee called it an unprecedented move during peacetime. Chamberlain responded that this was due to the current era, which had entered an unprecedented situation, forcing Britain to spend huge amounts on military expenses in a short period. Furthermore, the cost of military preparedness today had skyrocketed compared to after the World War. Every country felt the unreliability of the prospect of peace and was pouring all its efforts into increasing its offensive capabilities. As a result, the invention of new weapons, new transport, and new equipment was constantly evolving. However, as the spear becomes sharper, so does the shield become stronger. The cost of offensive and defensive equipment cannot be determined. However, because of the weight of its responsibilities and the number of its vulnerabilities, Britain could not neglect preparations for both offense and defense. Both domestically and on all lines of communication, it should use the latest equipment to resist attacks from others and must possess a strong military force that could be dispatched to any location at any time. Chamberlain stated that the White Paper published on Tuesday detailed the uses and applications of defense spending. Details of the usage would be available in the budget estimates of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Furthermore, the White Paper stated that the total defense expenditure over five years would reach £1.5 billion, but this was not a fixed number. If the situation changed and expenses could be reduced, the government would do its best to reduce them. However, since the military buildup of various countries began, the international situation had become unfavorable to Britain. If this continued, the current £1.5 billion would likely be felt to be insufficient.

Labor Party member Henderson then asked whether Britain would defend itself alone or be part of a collective security system. Chamberlain replied that for the public good, he could not ideally specify who was an enemy and who was a friend. The British government's plan was not directed against any one country or any one group of countries, but the government, for the sake of national security and to fulfill its responsibilities, had to present the necessary plan to Parliament. Chamberlain further pointed out that, according to the White Paper's projections, the additional annual tax revenue would be £32 million, and this did not include the amount to be borrowed. However, if Parliament did not grant the government the power to borrow, the additional national defense expenditure to be increased through taxes would be £112 million per year. In his view, such a huge tax burden would likely cause the nascent commercial recovery to suffer a setback and collapse. Chamberlain further explained that since taxpayers had already shouldered three-quarters of the total national defense expenditure, the increase in additional public debt was not excessive.

Chamberlain then discussed the method of borrowing, saying that the Treasury should have the power to raise funds in a way that was appropriate to the current situation and economical. The 3% interest rate and 30-year repayment method were merely accounting procedures and had no necessary connection to the Treasury's method of issuing bonds. The Treasury could issue bonds, treasury bills, or other types of bonds, with or without reserves. Chamberlain further pointed out that Attlee considered this method to be an error of wartime measures, but this method was fundamentally a way to maintain peace. The government's huge plan was necessary to ensure its own safety and maintain the safety of other countries, so it could not avoid its responsibility. As for the increased burden on the people due to military expenditure, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was most aware of its significance and deeply regretted the self-destruction of modern civilization, which did not know how to resolve its disputes through giving and taking, but instead strived for the prosperity and satisfaction of the world's human race. But at this moment, it could only grit its teeth and move forward, as peace, political stability, and disarmament could not be achieved by one country alone. But wherever and whenever Britain could find someone who shared its views, it would surely unite with them and jointly seek a more effective, more rational, and more valuable solution.

Regarding the Labor Party's criticism, Chamberlain further declared that if the Labor Party did not clearly answer whether it opposed the scope of the national defense plan outlined in the White Paper, Chamberlain solemnly stated that all the expenses listed in the White Paper were largely not duplicated. Regarding the self-governing regions, Chamberlain said that Britain had no right to make the self-governing regions bear part of the public expenditure, as the self-governing regions had already spent unlimited amounts of money on their own defense, and had already done their best for the safety of the whole. As for other burden-sharing methods, he knew of no current discussions. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

### British Upper House Discusses Colonial Issues

[London] At today's meeting of the Upper House, discussing the issue of Germany's demand for the return of its former colonies, Liberal Party member Lord Crewe declared that the division of Germany's colonies among various countries after the European War was a major political mistake. However, since things had already happened this way, it was not convenient to correct them. For now, the solution should be considered from an economic perspective. For example, in some African territories, an open-door system could be established to allow Germany to share the benefits. As for the various arguments Germany used to demand the return of its former colonies, they could not be established. In the past, when Germany had vast colonies, its dissatisfaction was even greater than it is today. At that time, the country was only concerned with having its reputation spread to foreign lands and its national strength reach its peak. Lord Plymouth, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, replied on behalf of the government, refuting the open-door theory, saying that a system of free access to raw materials did not seem to be what Germany was seeking. (17th, Havas)

[London] Today in the Upper House, Lord Buxton moved to expand the trusteeship system to apply to the colonies. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth replied that any suggestion to change the status of the people of the South African colonies would be met with fierce opposition. Buxton's proposed open-door policy would ultimately fail to grant any colony full financial autonomy, which would be a major obstacle to the development of self-government. In tropical colonies, regardless of which country they belonged to, implementing a trusteeship system and an open-door policy would not only be useless to Germany, where labor standards were relatively high, or any other country. Rather, it would allow countries with relatively low labor standards, especially Japan, to have a monopoly on trade there. As a result, European countries would lose all their possessions. A joint declaration by colonial powers, stating that they would strictly abide by Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant (regarding trusteeship rights), might not reduce the current tension, but it would certainly contribute to a political settlement. Therefore, the British government could not accept Buxton's motion at this time and believed that the Raw Materials Committee meeting to be held soon in Geneva would be able to find a more effective way to solve economic difficulties in its discussions. The matter was then dropped. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

### German General Göring Hunts in Poland

Meets with Military Leaders

Warsaw - Yesterday, German Aviation Minister General Göring hunted in the Biszowice area, killing three wolves. Because there was no snow in the mountains, his enthusiasm for hunting was somewhat diminished. Polish President Mościcki and his wife, Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski, German Ambassador to Poland Moltke, former Polish Army Chief of Staff General Sosnowski, former Deputy Minister of War General Fabrycy, and Director of External Affairs Count Rommer all participated in the hunt. General Ryz-Śmigły, Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces, was also scheduled to travel there from this evening with the Minister of War and several high-ranking generals to join the hunt.

### Siam Expands Military Preparedness

Has Purchased Warships and Aircraft from Italy, Japan, and the United States

[Singapore] As military competition among the countries of the world intensifies, Siam is unwilling to lag behind. In addition to ordering new warships from Italy and Japan, it has also ordered several large bombers from the United States, with a total value of US$750,000. The manufacturer is the Martin Company, with a speed of 235 miles per hour. It has also ordered seven torpedo boats from Italy. Now, the Siamese government has dispatched 700 naval personnel on a government yacht to Italy to take delivery. It has been learned that Italy has built a total of nine torpedo boats for the Siamese government, two of which were delivered last year. As for those ordered from Japan, there are two recently built training ships, four submarines, two gunboats, one transport ship, and three coastal defense ships. According to the Siamese government, Siam has a coastline of 1,500 miles, so the navy is the most important part of its national defense plan. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

### US High Commissioner to the Philippines

To Be Succeeded by McNutt

[Washington] Today, President Roosevelt appointed former Indiana Governor McNutt as the United States High Commissioner to the Philippines, succeeding the current Michigan Governor Murphy. McNutt said that he would take office within a month after Senate approval. However, he might not be able to hold this position until the President's term expires. People in the Philippines were quite surprised by McNutt's appointment, as they all thought that the current Acting Commissioner Jones would be officially appointed. After McNutt takes office, there will be many issues to be addressed, the most important of which are the amendment of the economic provisions of the Philippine Independence Act and the United States' future naval presence in the Philippines. (17th, Kuo Min News Agency) McNutt is 45 years old. He initially practiced law, then became a professor of law at Indiana University and dean of the law school. He also served on the National Administrative Committee for one year. McNutt is a member of the American Bar Association, the American Association of University Professors, the Association of American Law Schools, and the American Peace Society. His term as Governor of Indiana expired last month after serving for four years. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

[Washington] Today in the House of Representatives, Representative Crawford, who is familiar with the situation in the Philippines, suggested that the United States recognize Japan's protection of the Philippines after the Philippines becomes fully independent. Crawford also opposed allowing Philippine goods to be imported into the United States and compete with domestic goods, saying that when the United States conducts business negotiations with the Philippines, it should do so with the premise that "Japan will be the future protector of the Philippines," so that when "Japan is determined to advance into the Philippines," the United States will not be unable to maintain its established policy. If the United States retains its army and navy in the Philippines, it will cause international disputes. Furthermore, if the Philippines establishes a reciprocal trade agreement with the United States after independence, how can these preferential conditions not be extended to Japan?

### Japanese Military Attitude Towards Political Parties Becomes More Moderate

Minister of the Army Awaits Opportunity to Clarify Position; Hope for Cooperation in Administrative Reform

[Tokyo] Since the reopening of the Diet, Minister of the Army Sugiyama has answered questions from the general assembly of the House of Representatives regarding the national defense budget, administrative reform, the military discipline issue, and other questions the Diet has for the military. However, the political parties' understanding of the current situation is somewhat lacking, and they also have some misunderstandings about the military's true intentions. Therefore, Minister of the Army intends to summarize the contents of the questions and the military's views over the past three days, and originally planned to ask the Minister of the Army to take the opportunity to make an active statement at the general assembly on the 18th and frankly express his views. However, he did not get a suitable opportunity on the 18th and did not speak. Therefore, this matter must still wait for an opportunity in the future. (18th, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] According to the Army's observations, during the Hirota Cabinet, political parties failed to understand the extraordinary situation, which led to a great divergence of opinion with the military. However, after the resignation of the previous cabinet, the political parties' understanding of the situation has changed. For example, the speech by the president of the Seiyukai party immediately after the reopening of the Diet and the statement by the secretary-general of the Minseito party were completely consistent with the military's understanding of the situation. However, it is regrettable that the political parties still have questions that promote the separation of the military and the people. Now, the political parties also hope to cooperate with the military to realize administrative reform. Therefore, the Minister of the Army's response also seems to address this point. (18th, Domei News Agency)

### Situation of the General Assembly of the House of Representatives

[Tokyo] The general assembly of the House of Representatives on the 18th began at 1:00 PM, continuing the questions on the speeches of the Ministers of State from the previous day. Suzuki Seigo of the Kokumin Domei took the stage,

saying that the political platform declared by Prime Minister Hayashi was very abstract and could be interpreted as maintaining the status quo or as reform. This was the essence of the current cabinet. However, he hoped that it would not be a weak cabinet, but would develop into a strong cabinet. He praised the Prime Minister's principle of consistent administrative affairs, and again emphasized the failure of diplomacy towards China and the Soviet Union, saying that it was useless to advocate Sino-Japanese friendship today, and that what should be strengthened must be strengthened, and there was a need to cultivate strength. If it is desired to achieve the unification of diplomacy, there is no other way than to break the status quo of the various ministries and bureaus and change the cabinet system to a state council system. What is the government's view? The military ministers admitted to reducing local transfer payments. What are their opinions? Increasing taxes to increase the burden on the people. What considerations are there for this? If it is desired to realize the concretization of administrative reform, should a necessary budget be planned and a temporary Diet be convened quickly? Is there such a will? What is the specific plan to save the situation?

Finance Minister Yuki replied,

that the suspension of local financial transfer payments was not to suppress the rise in prices, but there were other considerations, namely, the reform of local finance. It is planned to quickly study the fundamental policy.

Prime Minister Hayashi replied,

that the government is carrying out unemployment relief and other social facilities. The Minister of the Army and the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not reply.

Then, Nakano Seigo took the stage, and his speech was extremely lengthy, taking up two and a half hours. The main points are summarized as follows:

In the future, military spending will increase indefinitely. It should be the people's task to endure the temporary pressure in the hope of national peace, and it is Finance Minister Yuki's task to avoid the heavy pressure of the situation. Although the Army says that it has the power to digest a budget of 1.4 billion, it is clear that there is a shortage of iron, coal, and other materials necessary for military preparations. Military strategy says that the use of troops should first be planned to equip the military. I don't know if the military has this preparation.

It is said that the five-year plan to develop Manchuria plans to spend a huge sum of 3 billion yen. Finance Minister Yuki should be asked to work hard to use his experience to develop the new world of Manchuria.

The Hayashi-Foreign Minister's diplomacy, whether towards China, the United Kingdom, or the United States, all exercises friendship uniformly, bowing to all sides. This can be called bowing diplomacy. However, diplomacy and the feeling of friendship should be separate matters. The evils of friendship diplomacy should be broken as soon as possible. As for the conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany and the problem of the Japan-Soviet fishing treaty, it can generally be considered that diplomacy has no direction.

After Minister of the Army Sugiyama and Finance Minister Yuki replied one after another, Prime Minister Hayashi answered as follows:

Under today's circumstances, it is impossible not to attempt to strengthen national defense. Therefore, it is impossible not to expect the strengthening of national power and the development of the economy. I also believe that in certain situations, I hope to actively adopt a control policy. To regard it as bowing diplomacy is a big mistake. I did not think that struggle diplomacy was right from the beginning. Afterwards, the Diet deliberated on the bills proposed by the government, and Finance Minister Yuki explained the reasons for the proposal. The meeting adjourned at 5:37 PM. (18th, Domei News Agency)

### General Assembly of the House of Representatives Budget Committee

Secret Meeting Held at the Request of the Minister of the Navy to Hear the Contents of the Military Budget

[Tokyo] The general assembly of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives on the 18th began at 10:00 AM. Katsuma Sisei of the Minseito party took the stage to ask questions.

Finance Minister Yuki frankly stated that there was no prospect for the future of finance, but it was surprising to plan such a huge budget and say that there was no prospect for future finance. At the very least, please give a considerable degree of prospect. Finance Minister Yuki replied,

that I had fully consulted with the military and hoped that the military would understand the national economic power and establish a future financial plan. However, there was no time to spare, so I only made revisions to remove the impact of the previous cabinet's budget. I hope to deliberate on it with this meaning.

Katsuma Sisei continued to press Finance Minister Yuki to announce his forecast of the financial plan, saying that the national defense plan in the 1937 budget should have had prospects for future continued expenses. Do you intend to announce this in the Diet? Finance Minister Yuki replied,

that regarding deficit bonds, depending on the situation of the financial world, it is possible to digest even more than 1 billion, so there is no need to worry about this point. Even though the Army and Navy budgets have recognized the 1937 budget, we still intend to fully review future national defense spending with the Army and Navy authorities. Therefore, it is difficult to predict it today. Katsuma also asked the military ministers, saying that although there is no need to worry about the surge in national defense spending in the future, the people want to know the specific facts about the necessity and content of the national defense plan.

Minister of the Navy Yonai replied,

that although I must speak in a public setting, there are many points about military regulations. Please open a secret meeting to explain it. Chairman Oyama started, saying, "Please open a secret meeting according to the government's request." The secret meeting opened at 11:00 AM. However, Chairman Oyama had some misunderstandings about Katsuma's questions and the government's opinions. Therefore, even though the secret meeting was opened, the Army and Navy still did not give any explanation. It was decided to open a secret meeting of the Budget Committee at 10:00 AM on the 19th to hear a detailed explanation on the contents of military spending and the actual situation of why national defense spending has become so huge. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 AM. (18th, Domei News Agency)

### Convening of a Temporary Diet

The Japanese Government Believes It Is Not Necessary; Important National Policies Await Careful Consideration

[Tokyo] After the Hayashi Cabinet was established, the Diet was suspended again, and preparations were made to deal with the Diet. As a result, it was only decided to deal with the budget as a central emergency measure, and the previous cabinet's policy of administrative reform was not reviewed and submitted to the Diet. Therefore, the Hayashi Cabinet has not yet reviewed the administrative reform policy and submitted it to the Diet. The Hayashi Cabinet has not yet decided on any specific attitude regarding the previous cabinet's important pending issues, such as the extension of compulsory education and the electricity problem. Therefore, it seems that these important bills will not be submitted to this session of the Diet. Prime Minister Hayashi, Finance Minister Yuki, Minister of the Army Sugiyama, and other government leaders exchanged opinions on this follow-up measure. (18th, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] The government leaders' views on the issue of convening a temporary Diet are roughly as follows:

(1) Local finance is closely related to tax system reform, so it must be carefully studied. It is not appropriate to think that it can be quickly passed into law after this session of the Diet. (2) Although it is urgent to reach a conclusion on the important policy of administrative reform due to the urgency of the internal and external situation, hasty action should be rejected, and there is no urgent situation that requires a temporary Diet to be convened to resolve it. (3) Since the Diet is requesting that the next regular Diet be convened in the middle of November, the occurrence of the temporary Diet issue is related to the handling of this issue and must be carefully considered. (11th, Domei News Agency)

### Revised Conscription Law in Japan

[Tokyo] The Imperial Ordinance for the Enforcement Regulations of the Military Service Law for the Army and Navy has been partially revised and was approved on the 18th. It will be promulgated in the Official Gazette on the 19th. Army authorities have issued a statement regarding this matter, the main points of which are summarized below: The main points of this revision of the Military Service Law Enforcement Regulations are the reduction of the height requirement for recruits by 5 "sun" (approximately 15 cm), and the change in the system for filling vacancies for active-duty soldiers. In the past, those who were not at least 1.55 meters tall could not be considered Class A or Class B soldiers. With this revision, those who are not at least 1.50 meters tall cannot be assigned to either Class A or Class B. Furthermore, in the past, active-duty soldiers and first-line reserve soldiers were conscripted from those who were 1.65 meters or taller. Now, the conscription will be from those who are 1.60 meters or taller. If there are not enough personnel for distribution, then the height requirement will be lowered uniformly for each rank in each unit, in order to sufficiently allocate the necessary personnel. In the past, even those who were physically strong but slightly below the height requirement could not be assigned to Class A or Class B soldiers. There were quite a few people in this category. Now, most of them will be eligible. As for the system for filling vacancies for active-duty soldiers, in the past, vacancies for active-duty soldiers up until the new recruits' enlistment period, and vacancies during the thirty-one days thereafter, had to be filled. This is now abolished. From the standpoint of the recruits, there is a rather long period from conscription to enlistment, and they feel quite anxious about whether they will be able to enlist, which is also quite detrimental to seeking employment. Now, this anxiety is relieved. For the military, it used to be quite late for replacement soldiers to enlist, and education was also inconvenient. Now, it is uniformly exempted. It is said that the revised ordinance will be implemented from the conscription of the twelfth year of Showa (1937). (18th, DOMEI News)

### Counteroffensive by the Western Government Forces in the Harama River Area

Pushed Forward Five Kilometers on the Southeastern Front – Conscripting Reserve Soldiers to Fight to the End

Madrid – Our correspondent Roland reports: At dawn this morning, government forces launched a counteroffensive against the Nationalist forces' positions southeast of Madrid. Fighting broke out immediately. Both sides had air force, artillery, tank, infantry, and cavalry units participating in the battle, and the situation was extremely intense. Until around 8:00 AM, the Nationalist forces resisted fiercely, and the government forces were not weak either. The battle became increasingly fierce, but around 11:00 AM, the government forces' fighter planes continuously strafed the enemy's concentrated areas with machine guns. The Nationalist forces began to falter. By 6:00 PM, the government forces had advanced approximately three kilometers near the villages of San Martín de la Vega. As a result, the highway from Madrid to Valencia is no longer under Nationalist control. (14th, Havas News)

Madrid – The National Defense Committee issued a battle report stating that, for the past week, the rebel forces have repeatedly launched attacks along the Harama River in the southeast of the capital towards the Valencia highway, attempting to cut off the transportation route between the capital and Valencia, but have so far failed. Although they attacked again yesterday, they were met with a head-on blow from the government forces, and have already retreated in defeat, abandoning several positions. Currently, the government forces have advanced five kilometers along the front line in that area. When the enemy forces retreated, they abandoned a large amount of military equipment. In addition, government warships opened fire and bombarded the forts of Ceuta, Spanish Morocco. (18th, Havas News)

Ávila – Our correspondent Taus Bidet reports: Yesterday, government forces launched two attacks in the Harama River area south of Madrid. Both attacks were very fierce, but in the end, they gained nothing. First, the government artillery began shelling the Nationalist forces' front lines near the Valencia highway and the village of Marañosa at 5:30 AM, with the intention of covering the infantry, detouring to the left bank of the Harama River, and attacking the Nationalist forces from the rear. The Nationalist forces blocked them with machine guns and artillery, causing the government forces to be in a dilemma and unable to move. At that time, two tanks were destroyed by the Nationalist forces. At noon, the militia launched another attack, hoping to break through to the Nationalist forces' trenches and engage in hand-to-hand combat, but they were still defeated by the Nationalist forces. As a result of this battle, the Nationalist forces have made a small advance, and their front-line positions have become even more fortified. The Nationalist forces on the front lines of Escorial, northwest of Madrid, occupied an important position near Robledo de Chavela yesterday afternoon. The location is sufficient to control Escorial, and it is expected that the fall of the city will not be far off. (18th, Havas News)

Valencia – The Spanish government is taking a strong counteroffensive in the Jarama River area to protect the communication between Madrid and Valencia. The government has now ordered the conscription of reserve soldiers of all ranks from the five years between 1932 and 1936. The authorities also stated that they intend to strictly remove senior commanders who are ineffective in combat, and said that the general public now advocates a conscription system and does not prohibit the continued recruitment of volunteers. However, volunteers must join the regular army units in accordance with ordinary military conditions. The government is now planning to implement forced war labor and will consult with various labor unions in order to create a strong war industry and nationalize necessary factories. At the same time, the military authorities have received news that the government forces' battle to protect the capital's lifeline is progressing smoothly. It is reported that the rebel forces have been forced to retreat, especially those retreating around San Martín. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

Madrid – Rebel planes bombed the capital and Valencia again today. Several bombs fell in the neutral zone near the American embassy. One bomb hit the embassy but fortunately did not explode. After investigation, 11 people were killed and 72 injured. (18th, Guomin News)

### Prohibition of Volunteers Going to Spain

French Cabinet Approves Measures

[Paris] The cabinet has approved a plan to prevent volunteers from going to Spain. The plan includes: 1. Strengthening air force surveillance of aircraft departing from airfields; 2. Closely monitoring ports and border stations; 3. Placing special police on trains that may be used by volunteers; 4. Ordering the prohibition of all radio stations from broadcasting recruitment appeals; 5. Intensifying the monitoring of passport issuance. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

[Paris] The orders, ministerial decrees, and proclamations regarding the prohibition of volunteers from going to Spain will be signed by President Lebrun and will take effect from midnight on February 20th. Thereafter, French railways, shipping companies, and airlines will not be allowed to issue tickets to Spain, with the exception of travelers with special passports, such as journalists and diplomats, who will still be able to purchase tickets to travel to Spain. Furthermore, aircraft are not allowed to pass within ten kilometers of the Pyrenees Mountains bordering France and Spain, in order to prevent them from flying to Spain. (18th, Havas News)

[Paris] The draft law submitted by the government to the National Assembly to prohibit abnormal price increases is scheduled to be implemented from February 15th for a period of six months. During this period, any food or daily necessities whose selling price exceeds the original price on July 1st of last year will be considered an unfair price increase. Even if the raw materials for the manufacture of such goods increase in price, or other costs increase, they cannot be used as a legitimate reason for raising the price of the goods. Factory owners and wholesalers should request the National Price Monitoring Committee to monitor whether the prices they set are appropriate. The Monitoring Committee shall make a decision within fifteen days of receiving the request. Wholesalers who unfairly increase prices may be fined from 500 francs to 5,000 francs. Retailers who unfairly increase prices may be fined from 16 francs to 500 francs. For private residences, shops, and factories that have been punished, the court of first instance may order the posting of the crime in front of the door for two weeks to serve as a warning. The court of first instance may also order the publication of such crimes in one or more daily newspapers. (18th, Havas News)

### American Federation of Labor Supports Judicial Reform

[Washington] The American Federation of Labor today formally voted in favor of President Roosevelt's plan to reform the judicial system. (17th, Guomin News)

### US Senator Proposes Constitutional Amendment

Congress Shall Have the Power to Re-enact Any Law Deemed Unconstitutional

[Washington] Senators Wheeler and Boaz today introduced a constitutional amendment in the Senate, authorizing Congress to re-enact any law deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court with a two-thirds vote in both houses. The senators expect the proposal to be accepted as a compromise between the supporters and opponents of the president's plan to reorganize the Supreme Court. The Senate then passed a resolution by Judiciary Committee Chairman McCarron, requesting that government departments submit detailed information on all congressional laws that the Supreme Court has invalidated. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

### Russian Appointed Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations

[Geneva] The League of Nations Secretariat has formally announced the appointment of Sukholin, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in France, as Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations. Sukholin is currently 50 years old, was born in Geneva, and studied in both this city and Moscow. In 1931, he was appointed Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in France. In 1935, he was promoted to Chargé d'affaires in Romania, and then transferred back to the Paris Embassy as Counselor, a position he holds to this day. He was a member of the Soviet delegation at the 1932 Disarmament Conference and the 1933 World Economic Conference. (18th, Havas News)

### Detailed Record of the Succession of Political Power in Shaanxi After the Xi'an Incident

Currently, Yu Xuezhong and He Zhuguo are working with Gu Zhutong to plan for the aftermath.

Xi'an Correspondence: The Xi'an Incident erupted last winter, and two months have passed since then. Although it has now come to an end, the evolution and changes in political power and personnel have been extremely complicated. However, due to traffic obstructions, rumors are often inaccurate, and it is especially difficult to obtain accurate information due to the severe restrictions on news in the past. After the resolution of the incident, our reporter went to Xi'an to investigate the situation in all aspects, and recorded the observations as follows.

Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters

Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters

Originally, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek served as the Commander-in-Chief, and Chief of Staff Yan Daogang took charge of everything. But in reality, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang oversaw the overall situation. After the incident, Yan was detained, and the headquarters was reorganized into the "Northwest Provisional Military Committee of the Allied Forces," with Dong Yingbin, commander of the 57th Army (whose original position was filled by the promoted division commander Miao Chengcang), replacing Yan as Chief of Staff. Initially, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng were appointed as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Military Committee, but later they were changed to Chairman and Vice-Chairman. When Zhang accompanied Generalissimo Chiang to Nanjing, he left a handwritten order instructing Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong to be fully responsible for military and political affairs. However, Yu flew back to Lanzhou after the incident, and only came to Xi'an a week before the peaceful resolution. In the meantime, Dong Yingbin, Wang Yizhe, and He Zhuguo worked together to support the situation, while Yang Hucheng was not much involved. A few days before the Central Army entered the city, Yang went to Sanyuan to take care of personal matters, and Dong led the working staff to move to Binzhou to work. At this time, Wang had already been tragically murdered. Currently, only Yu and He remain in Xi'an, consulting with the Director of the Executive Headquarters, Gu Zhutong, on the aftermath. After this, the name of the headquarters will be changed again, perhaps to the Gansu Pacification Commissioner's Office, in order to command its remaining troops, because its Xi'an Garrison Headquarters uses this name.

Xi'an Pacification Commissioner's Office

After the Xi'an Incident, Yang Hucheng continued to use the name of the Xi'an Pacification Commissioner's Office to exercise his powers, and the internal personnel were not changed. Only Huang Niantang, the Director of the Transportation Department, was arrested for allegedly sending a telegram to Luoyang urging the rescue of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He was eventually shot and killed before the peaceful resolution.

Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters

Most of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee members were detained during the incident. After Generalissimo Chiang returned to Nanjing, they went east unharmed. They then set up a temporary office of the Party Headquarters in Tongguan, which was still presided over by the original members. Zhang and Yang had appointed Wang Bingnan and four others as members of the Mass Movement Guidance Committee to act on behalf of the Provincial Party Headquarters. After the peace agreement, they were immediately dissolved. Currently, the original Provincial Party Committee members, such as Guo Zijun, have all returned to the province.

Shaanxi Provincial Government

After Shao Lizi resigned as the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Zhang and Yang first appointed Du Bincheng as the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government to maintain the situation. There were not many changes in the internal personnel. Then, Wang Yishan, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, was ordered to concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Provincial Government until January 1st. Although Sun Weiru did not publicly announce his assumption of the position of Chairman of the Provincial Government appointed by the Central Government, all departments had already received a clear order from the Provincial Government, notifying them that Sun would officially be responsible for matters from that day onwards. Now that the incident has been resolved, there is no question that Sun will take office.

Department of Civil Affairs

Peng Zhaoxian, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, was dismissed after the Shaanxi Incident. Yang Hucheng's outgoing Chief of Staff, Wang Yishan, succeeded him. Because Wang was concurrently serving as the Director of the Provincial Government, most of the department's affairs were handled by the Secretary-General, Mi Zanchen. For the county magistrates of the various counties, except for Weng Cheng, the magistrate of Chang'an County, who was detained after the Shaanxi Incident (the Chang'an residents' association organized a committee to settle Weng's accounts, but nothing further was heard), and Han Zhuoru, the Director of Sun Weiru's Provincial Office, who was acting as his agent, there were no other changes. Occasionally, a small number of county magistrates fled after the incident, and the Civil Affairs Department simply selected people from nearby counties to fill the positions.

Department of Finance

Xu Shifu and Feng Qinzao, the army commander of Yang Hucheng's army, were from the same hometown and had a very close relationship. Feng recommended Xu to serve as the Director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office and as a counselor. At the beginning of the incident, Feng expressed his opposition. Yang Hucheng considered Xu to be experienced and prudent, and also wanted to please Feng, so he eagerly appointed Xu as the Director of the Department of Finance. Zhu Jingzhou, the original director, had only taken office for a few weeks when he encountered the incident. Zhu also had a good personal relationship with Yu Xuezhong and could have been reappointed, but Zhu firmly declined. Xu knew that his position was temporary and tried to appease and retain the old subordinates of the former director, Ning Qianting (who died of fright after the incident). In addition, tax revenues were stagnant, and there were not many affairs to handle, so he was able to maintain the status quo until now.

Department of Construction

Although the director of the department, Lei Baohua, was from Shaanxi, his relationship with Shao Lizi was quite deep. After the incident, he expressed his firm resignation. The provincial government believed that all construction had virtually stopped during the military period, so it did not appoint anyone to succeed Lei. Lei himself was also uneasy in his position. Finally, during the mediation of the peace, he flew to Nanjing with Li Zhigang, Yang Hucheng's representative stationed in Nanjing, and never returned. This position is still vacant.

Department of Education

Zhou Xuechang, the director of the department, had been in office for many years. In recent years, he had been ostracized by people in the education sector of the province, and his work became increasingly difficult. In addition, radical ideas filled the minds of students in various schools, and student unrest was hidden. The student petition last winter was one example. At the time of the incident, Zhou became the focus of student attacks. Fortunately, he escaped danger and left Shaanxi. The provincial government appointed Li Shouting, Zhou's predecessor, to succeed him. Many of Zhou's staff were replaced, and due to environmental factors, he tried to accommodate elements with color as much as possible. The appointment of Yang Mingxuan, a core figure in the Northwest National Salvation Association, as the director of the primary school teacher training center, and Jiang Longji and others as principals of various middle schools, were further evidence of this. As for the students, they were quite radical and active at first, but later, due to the unstable situation, most of the students' families forced their children to return home, and the schools went on vacation early and indefinitely. To this day, no date has been set for school to resume.

Military and Police Supervisory Office

Xie Ke, the director of the Military and Police Supervisory Office, was highly respected by all parties. In the past, Yang Zhenya, the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the Central Military Police, Ma Zhichao, the director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, and Zhang Yizhong, the director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office Military Law Department, all served concurrently as deputy directors, and a mixed organization was established as the Military and Police Supervisory Office, with Xie as the director. After the incident, Xie left his post to work for peace. Ma and Yang went into hiding, and Zhang was killed. Therefore, Sun Mingwen, Zhang Xueliang's special forces commander, took over as director. Sun was a young general in the Northeast Army, lacking a soul, and advocated resisting the central government and starting a civil war. Later, Sun murdered Wang Yizhe, commander of the 67th Army, and three others, attempting to create a terrifying situation. Afterwards, he fled in fear of punishment. Peace was also declared soon after. The Pacification Commissioner's Office then appointed Wang Zongshan, the director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, to concurrently serve as director.

Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau

Ma Zhichao, the director of the bureau, was a student in the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy from Shaanxi. He had been in office for several years. On the day of the incident, the Public Security Bureau was attacked by the 2nd Security Brigade of Yang Hucheng's army. After a fierce battle for half a day, it finally succumbed. Ma disguised himself as a coachman and fled Xi'an. Zhao Shoushan, the brigade commander of Sun Weiru, was initially appointed as the director of the bureau. Zhao then took his troops to garrison Sanyuan, and Wang Zongshan, Sun's counselor, succeeded him. Wang was a student from Shaanxi who had studied in the United States and had served as a member of the Gansu Provincial Government and as a regiment commander. He worked hard for peace this time.

Martial Law Headquarters

On the day of the Shaanxi Incident, Sun Weiru was appointed by Zhang and Yang as the commander of the Xi'an Martial Law Headquarters. Later, Liu Duoquan, the commander of the 105th Division of the Northeast Army, was appointed as the deputy commander in order to jointly maintain the chaotic situation. At that time, the city's defense and security were jointly responsible by Sun's 2nd Security Brigade and two units of the 105th Division. The Martial Law Headquarters was not abolished until peace was declared. Before the Central Army entered the province, the 2nd Security Brigade was replaced by the 1st Security Brigade to maintain order in the city because of its poor military discipline, and they were able to coexist peacefully.

Security Office

Zhang Kunsheng, the Director of the Security Office, was also a student in the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy from Shaanxi. Because he had a small force of troops, he was attacked even more fiercely than the Public Security Bureau that day. After the incident, Zhang also went into hiding. Yang Hucheng then established another Security Headquarters, appointing himself as the Commander of Security for the entire province, and appointing Han Weixi as the Chief of Staff.

### Xingzhong Company to Establish Haihe Transportation Company

Investing 3 Million to Specialize in Transporting Goods within the Haihe River - Three Organizations including the Dajin Vapor Ship Company Join

Tianjin Correspondence: Xingzhong Company recently plans to occupy the right to transport goods on the Haihe River between Dagu, Tanggu, and Tianjin, and organize a tugboat and barge transportation company, equipped with dozens of ships, specializing in the transshipment and lighterage business in the waterway between Dagu and Tianjin that large steamships cannot reach. However, there are foreign-owned barge transportation companies operating in the Haihe River, and the Tianjin Customs Shipping Office has already obtained a patent. In order to handle the same business, Xingzhong is afraid that the Customs will not allow it, so the current plan is determined to avoid surface business conflicts, publicly stating that the company is only engaged in loading reed salt from Tanggu and barging it to the outer port for export to large steamships, to show that it is not competing with the foreign-owned companies. Last week, the Tianjin Branch of Xingzhong Company formulated the outline of the business organization, which is roughly as follows: "1. The name of the company is set as Tanggu Transportation Company; 2. The capital is 3 million yuan, the first installment of 1 million yuan will be collected and the business will be started immediately; 3. The company organization will be handled in accordance with the Japanese company law, with Xingzhong Company as the center, and the Dajin Vapor Ship Company, International Transportation Company, and Japan-Manchuria Takuso Association jointly investing capital; 4. The head office is located in Dalian, and the branch office is located in Tanggu; 5. The organization will be established in early April." Xingzhong Director Hirayama and Branch Manager Qingye are currently busy preparing in Tianjin. Since this news came out, foreign merchants have paid close attention to it. In recent years, smuggling has been rampant in North China, and most of the goods come from Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao. It has not been seen that they are transported to Tianjin via the Haihe River. This is due to the strict inspection and blockade by the Customs, but at the same time, the management of barges in the Haihe River is in the hands of the British and Americans, which is isolated from smugglers. Although the vagrants intend to use the river to directly transport smuggled goods from outside Dagukou, it is practically impossible. Now, Xingzhong Company is handling this transportation company, and its desire to obtain the transportation rights of the Haihe River for the convenience of transportation by Japanese public and private sectors is obvious. It is impossible for foreign merchants to prevent its establishment, but they hope that the Customs will have a good way to deal with it so that its plan will not be realized.

The export of Changlu salt transportation is still under negotiation. Xingzhong Company is responsible for handling this matter this year. Last week, it specially sent Managing Director Uchida to Tianjin to coordinate with Director Hirayama, Branch Manager Qingye, Tianjin Deputy Consul Nagai Junichi, and others to negotiate with the Changlu Transportation Office, Lufeng Store, and the salt households in Hantang and Lianggu salt fields, and continue to carry out a transaction to purchase 200,000 to 250,000 tons. The Changlu Transportation Office entrusted this matter to Lufeng Store, ordering it to contact the salt households on its behalf and persuade them. However, the salt households have deep-rooted prejudices, insisting on the principle of losing more by selling more and losing less by selling less, and only allowing the export of 100,000 tons, and the price of salt per ton must be higher than last year. Xingzhong Company has agreed to slightly increase the price, offering 2.4 yuan per ton, which is 0.55 yuan less than the 2.95 yuan demanded by the salt households. However, the purchase quantity must be around 250,000 tons. Currently, Hokkaido Tokushu Soda Co., Ltd. and Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. in Japan are in urgent need of chemical industrial salt and expect it to be shipped by April 1st. Therefore, the activities of Nagai and Uchida and others have become more active in recent days. It is rumored that the purchase contract may be signed early next month, but when asked about the Changlu Transportation Office, they denied it. (16th)

### A Record of Shanghai Team's Three Matches in Hong Kong

Won the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Championship 4-3  Hong Kong Chinese United New Army Suffered Defeat 4-1  Lost to the Strongest Hong Kong Military United Team 1-2

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The annual Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match was held at the Naval Ground on the 11th of this month (i.e., the first day of the Lunar New Year). Around 3 o'clock, the stands were already full, and latecomers were unable to enter. Before the match, the Shifford Army Band performed to celebrate. The Shanghai team came to the match this time with an all-Western lineup, and its strength was unusually strong. In addition to defeating the Hong Kong team with a score of 4-3 on New Year's Day to regain the championship, it also defeated the Hong Kong Chinese United Team with a score of 4-1 at the Caroline Hill Ground on the 13th. Therefore, the Shanghai team's southern expedition this time was quite successful. Looking back at the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Match, it has been held 18 times to date. The Shanghai team has won 10 times and lost 8 times, while the Hong Kong team has won 8 times and lost 10 times. The Hong Kong team's strength in this session was originally able to beat the Shanghai team, but unfortunately it failed to do so as desired, resulting in signing an alliance under duress. Fans who care about the Hong Kong team all regret it for the Hong Kong team.

The match started at 3:30. The Shanghai team wore white jerseys, and the Hong Kong team wore blue jerseys. Amidst the cheers of more than 10,000 fans, the Shanghai team took the lead. The center forward Lao took big strides and passed to the right striker. Fuen advanced along the line, but was limited by Dagaoshan Nu. Hui Tang led the army to counterattack, and Jingxiang took the opportunity to break through, but was snatched by Mashan'er. Shuiyi and Jingxiang made short passes to advance, step by step, and passed the ball to the left, but no one responded, and they returned without success. At this time, the Hong Kong team took a siege position. Wilson responded and made a flat shot 20 yards from the goal, but failed to score. Before long, Feng Shentui tried his footwork, and the ball went very hard, but it went over the goal. The Shanghai team's defenders resisted strongly. Baoxiutuo and Bolinggai counterattacked urgently, but were repelled by Tiansheng and Dagaoshan Nu. Wilson missed the ball within inches of the goal. Everyone regretted that a good opportunity to win was missed. In the heavy siege, Walter of the Shanghai team sent the ball far away. Center forward Lao responded, dodged Dagaoshan Nu, and Tiansheng returned to the army, but it was too late, so Lao scored with a low shot, opening the record. The game restarted at the center circle. Rongzhao fought bravely and left the field. Hong Kong changed to fighting with ten people. The Shanghai army took this opportunity and launched an attack from the border by Fuen, and the pass was just right. Dagaoshan Nu came out, slightly delayed, so Lao used a header to score. Bao was about to catch the ball at this time, but unexpectedly the ball rebounded off Baoxiutuo's foot after landing, and he then shot into the empty goal, forming a situation of 2-0. The Shanghai team's military prestige was greatly boosted by this unexpected gain. Fuen was unsupervised and was rushed over again, hitting the top of the post and rebounding into the net. In the first half, the Shanghai team won 3-0. After changing sides, the Hong Kong team worked hard to strengthen itself. Only two minutes after the start, Feng Jingxiang was rescued by Rongzhao and sent a light pass. Hui Tang made a left-right dribble, broke through the last line of defense, and regained the situation of 3-1 with a single shot into the city. Hui Tang followed up with a shot, which could have directly attacked Huanglong, but Bao Saizhong was as helpful as a god, and made a diving save, unexpectedly turning the tide, and the Shanghai team's lack of loss was really a blessing. However, not long after, the Hong Kong team came back again, Shuiyi and Jingxiang worked together, Feng transported to the left, and the ball hit the leg of an enemy guard. Wilson took advantage of the situation to invade to the right and bounced the ball into the net, becoming a situation of 3-2. Unexpectedly, Fuen followed up with a shot, and the ball went as fast as lightning, and Jianping could not save it at all. The Hong Kong gate was lost again, and the Shanghai team created an advantage of 4-2 again. Hui Tang was still not discouraged, and took the opportunity to sprint, and was surrounded by three enemy guards, knocking Hui Tang down. A penalty of 12 yards was awarded, and Li scored the goal, chasing back the situation of 4-3. After another period of fighting, each team gained nothing. Heaven did not bless the Hong Kong team, and finally there was an alliance under duress. Re-victory over Hualian and the Shanghai Interport Representative Team's performance match against the Hong Kong Hualian Team was held at the Caroline Hill South China Stadium at 3:30 pm on the 13th. The audience was still crowded. The lineup of both sides was as follows:

The center line began to push forward, and the five tigers of the Hua team bravely moved forward. Deng Guangsen passed the ball to Chen Dehui, and Dehui lost sight of Zou Wenzhi, who raised his foot to explore, and the ball responded by entering the net, opening the record. Unexpectedly, in a few minutes, the enemy generals were as fierce as wolves, and the Hua team was thrown on their backs and horses turned over. Tui Le robbed the ball and passed it to the left, and Baoxiutuo leaped up and headed the ball into the net, making it a 1-1 situation. After restarting the ball, the Hualian team was already showing signs of decline. Deng Guangsen was injured and left the field again. A few minutes later, the enemy striker launched an attack. Lao Ba dribbled the ball forward, and the Hua team's defender rushed to save, but the ball had already flown into the net under the foot of Xiaohua Te. After another fight, Mai Zhaohan accidentally committed a handball and was penalized with a 12-yard penalty, which was kicked by Gelinbo and hit Xu Heng's chest, rebounded out, and Xiaohua Te added another foot, making the score 3-1. Lemon passed, and after changing sides, the Hua team generals were like old men after illness, and it was difficult to walk. Lin Depu was expelled from the field again for committing a foul, and only ten people were fighting. Fortunately, the two generals Mai and Huang joined forces to resist the enemy, and Xu Heng also carefully guarded the gate, so although the enemy repeatedly fired secret shots, only one goal was scored by Gelinbo. As a result, the Shanghai team won the Hualian team by a score of four to one. Defeated by the Military United Team, the Shanghai Interport Football Team came to Hong Kong this time with an all-Western lineup to attend the Interport Match. The athletes were full of energy and had the heart to win. On New Year's Day, they defeated the Hong Kong team with a score of 4-3 and regained the Interport Championship, and then defeated the Hong Kong Hualian Team with a score of 4-1. Two consecutive victories are enough to be proud of. On the 15th, they met with the Military United elite at the So Kon Po Stadium. This match was one of the most exciting scenes of the Shanghai Interport Team's southern match with the East China Team. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Interport Team not only did not easily win the Military United Team, but was defeated by the Military United Team with a score of 2-1, failing to maintain its winning record and return to Shanghai in triumph. The military fans watching the game shouted wildly, and the sound shook the valley. The Shanghai team's defeat in the final battle was really unfortunate. The team will take the British mail ship Nalutda on the 18th (Thursday) from Hong Kong to return to Shanghai after the competition in Hong Kong is over.

### Commenting on Hong Kong's Defeat to Shanghai

The Shanghai team's charge is fierce and good at using both wings. Defense and attacking the goal are above the Hong Kong team.

The Shanghai team's success in this Interport Football Match was in the first half. They relied on Bao Saizhong to guard the steel gate, so that the burly center-back Walter and Mashan'er surrounded Li Huitang, and relied on the valiant wings to make a rapid counterattack. Although the Shanghai team was repeatedly surrounded, every counterattack could put the Hong Kong team to death. On the other hand, the Hong Kong team's striker crawled in the Shanghai hinterland without progress.

The connection is loose and the advancement is very slow. The comparison between the two is different in speed and slowness. Moreover, the center forward of the Shanghai team, Lawlers Torres, specializes in charging, always charging in first and then taking the ball (repeatedly violating this rule, but the referee was very negligent in this regard). Dagaoshan was also knocked down by Lao many times. The remaining four forwards were also able to use the English-style long pass method to charge and make zigzag-shaped long passes. When they saw the ball, they rushed, and when they rushed, they shot, which often made it impossible for the Hong Kong goalkeeper to cover the goal, and the defenders were exhausted. After the Shanghai team won the second lucky goal, the morale of the Hong Kong army was greatly hit. If the Hong Kong team's striker had not repeatedly missed the opportunity and the referee's decision had been negligent, the Hong Kong team would have had a great hope of tying the score at 4-4 and then winning. The reason for the Hong Kong team's defeat is that all the generals had a slight contempt for the enemy early on, resulting in the loss in the first half. In the second half, they worked hard to strengthen themselves and fought hard, and were able to pull back three cities. Moreover, in the overall war, the attackers were eight or nine out of ten, which shows that the Hong Kong team has the potential to win the Shanghai team. Unfortunately, they frustrated their sharpness, resulting in a feeling of being too late to regret it.

All parts of the Hong Kong team's army revealed weaknesses. The striker adopted a narrow W-shaped offensive strategy, and its sharpness was at the sharpest point, that is, the center forward Li Huitang. The entire line of five forwards, except for Li, could break through the enemy's defense several times alone, and the other forwards did not try to attack the goal. Although Feng and Shuiyi had a skilled connection, it did not help the overall situation. Wilson and Biford made slight progress in the second half, but they missed many opportunities in the first half. In terms of center backs, Jin Bilu stuck to the old ways and failed to adapt to the situation. He always made short passes with the two center backs and then helped the forwards, giving the Shanghai team a chance to deploy. Yi Yunshi was brave, but unfortunately he was not safe in his position and went out alone from time to time, so the right wing of the Shanghai team had sufficient activity. Therefore, the loss of goals by the Hong Kong team mostly came from the right wing of the Shanghai team, and Yi Yunshi should be blamed. Among the three center backs, Rongzhao was the best. In terms of defenders, it was unexpected that the veteran Dagaoshan Nu also performed abnormally in this battle. Tiansheng and Jianping were unstable due to Gaoshan Nu,

Lost confidence and the performance was far from as good as in the past. The Shanghai team was good at using high balls, so that the five forwards used the charging method to advance. This was really not something that Jianping could handle. If Roland was used, the two inside guards could focus all their efforts on blocking the enemy's forwards, or could reduce their worries. Bao Saizhong of the Shanghai team was really the first to contribute. Li Huitang made several powerful shots, which were all saved. Unfortunately, none of the Hong Kong team's forwards could charge into the battle and shake the Shanghai team's defense. Therefore, the Shanghai team's defenders were able to calmly deal with the difficulties. The Shanghai team won three goals first, but there were three goals lost in the second half, which shows that the wind was also very important. In the last three minutes, Li Huitang hooked a ball, which the goalkeeper could not possibly save, but Heaven did not abandon the Shanghai team, and Mashan'er happened to be standing there, turning the tide. This was the Shanghai team's luck and the Hong Kong team's misfortune.

### Shanghai Chinese Football Team Leaves Hong Kong for Guangdong

Fundraising Match for the Convenience Hospital in Guangzhou Tomorrow

Shanghai Interport Team Changes to Return North Today

Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th – The Shanghai Chinese Football Team, a group of 13 people, led by Jiang Xiangqing, went to Guangdong by car at 8 am on the 18th to hold a fundraising match for the Convenience Hospital on the 20th. Also, the Shanghai Interport Football Team Zha Xu and others were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the British mail ship Nalutra on the 18th, but the ship was delayed in arriving in Hong Kong and changed to return north on the 19th.

Hong Kong, 17th – The East China Team played a performance match with the Hong Kong United Team at Caroline Hill at 4 pm on the 17th. Li Ning was not in the game due to injury and was replaced by Gu Shangxiang and Jiang Zhaoxiang as left and right fullbacks. Feng Yunyou and Wang Kehou were the middle and left backs. The rest were unchanged. Because the striker was weak and the connection was not good, after ten minutes, the Hong Kong team's Xiaogaoshan Nu shot a goal. Five minutes later, Li Anna headed a goal, and Di Nuosheng and Xiaogaoshan Nu each scored another goal. In the first half, East China only had parry and no counterattack. In the second half, East China tried to recover, and Luo Douwen shot for the first time after ten minutes, but it was blocked. On the contrary, the Hong Kong team's Hu Li shot a long shot from 30 yards away, and Liu Shizhan committed a foul and was penalized with a 12-yard free kick, which was kicked by the Hong Kong goalkeeper Roland, and he kicked it in, which is also rare for goalkeepers to meet. The Hong Kong team, with the victory and defeat already determined, held on to the victory and did not attack fiercely anymore. East China took the opportunity to counterattack and shot several times, but none of them worked. As a result, the team lost with a score of 0 to 6. The team has finished its performance in Hong Kong and decided to go to the province on the 18th.

### An Exciting Scene of the Sino-British Shooting Match Zhang Yingda Won Clark Yesterday

Match Result: 600 to 415 Points  Today's Last Game: Zhu Qiliang vs. Nie Ke'er

The Sino-British shooting match has been played in four groups, and China has won three and lost one. The war situation in the past was the most exciting yesterday for Zhang Yingda and Clark. Zhang Yingda won Clark by 185 points yesterday, thanks to the last three shots, and the audience was fascinated by the wonderful performances of both sides and the competition for scores up and down. At 5:30 pm today, the first group of the Chinese team, Zhu Qiliang, will play against the British Nie Ke'er, and the game will still be held in the 88th Association on Nanjing Road. Zhu's skills are higher than the opponent's, and victory is not a problem. Therefore, the championship of this session will undoubtedly belong to China.

Zhang Yingda gave me a very good impression yesterday. His expertise in opening energy and sending bullets to fall are all performed in a relaxed and fluent manner. A shot of 83 points was created by various methods, which won full acclaim and was his proud masterpiece in recent months.

At the beginning, the two were neck and neck, with a difference of no more than ten points, and the maximum distance was only more than 30 points. Zhang Yingda was always ahead of Clark. By the time of a shot of 42 and another shot of 83, Clark was lagging behind by more than 124 points (489 to 365). Finally, he added another shot of 43 points, and Clark had no hope of winning, and finally lost with a score of 415 to 600.

Zhang Yingda 22, 38, 30, 52, 29, 31, 42, 83, 43

### Special Exhibition at the City Museum Extended

Closed at 4:30 PM on the 21st. The Shanghai City Museum held its first special exhibition, which opened to the public on February 11th. Coinciding with the Lunar New Year, the crowds visiting were particularly large, averaging several thousand people daily. In the museum's various exhibition halls, visitors were packed shoulder to shoulder, and the special exhibition hall was even more overcrowded. This was because the exhibition hall featured over a thousand films, all capturing the exteriors and interiors of museums around the world, along with their displays. These were all exhibited together, showcasing magnificent and solemn architecture, elegant and refined garden landscapes, diverse display methods, and vast collections of exhibits. As a result, visitors felt as if they were personally present in those places. It was reported that the exhibition was originally scheduled to last for only one week. However, due to the continued high attendance and numerous requests for extension from groups, schools, and individuals, it has been decided to extend the exhibition until 4:30 PM on February 21st, after which it will not be extended further. With only three days remaining, those who have not yet visited should not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

### Chinese Education Society

Seeking Opinions on Attending the World Education Conference and the Location of This Year's Annual Meeting. The Seventh World Education Conference is scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan, in August of this year. The Chinese Education Society is currently collaborating with national educational academic societies to discuss matters related to participation. However, rumors circulate that some countries not recognized by the League of Nations (such as the puppet state of Manchuria) are requesting to send representatives to participate, which would severely undermine our national dignity. In the event that this becomes a reality, how should we respond? This necessitates seeking high-level opinions from our members in advance to avoid difficulties in making temporary arrangements. It is reported that a few questions have been drafted to solicit opinions to ensure safety: (1) If the puppet state participates, can we participate first and then withdraw to express protest and opposition? (2) If we learn that the puppet state will participate, can we decide not to travel east to participate? (3) Are there any other suggestions? Furthermore, the society's third annual meeting was held in Wuchang last February. The following locations have been resolved for the next annual meeting: (1) Beiping (2) Lushan (3) Qingdao (4) Chengdu. The board of directors will deliberate based on the prevailing circumstances and make a final decision on the location. Subsequently, it was submitted to the second board of directors meeting for resolution, which entrusted the standing committee of directors to decide on one location and notify it. It is now reported that letters have been sent to solicit public opinion, selecting one location from the above four for reference and to facilitate the final decision.

### Overview of Shanghai Experimental Elementary School (II)

Special report from this newspaper, investigation by Hu Zuyin.

2. School Buildings and Equipment

The school is currently divided into three sections: Section 1 is located on Shangwen Road, covering an area of over 2.8 mu. The school buildings were constructed in the third year of the Republic (1914) with a main structure shaped like a horizontal concave character. Section 2 is located on Wenmiao Road, covering approximately 4 mu, and utilizes the Liu Gong Minzhong Second Ancestral Hall as school buildings. Section 3 is located in Wujia Lane on Hu-Min Road, with a relatively large foundation, covering approximately 50 mu. The school buildings here are newly built, with construction beginning in July of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) and completed four months later.

The school buildings in Section 3 are in a linear style, divided into two stories with a corridor in the middle of the upper and lower floors. Both sides are classrooms, totaling eighteen rooms. Later, due to the sharp increase in boarding students, the newly built dormitories were insufficient, so two bungalows were built in July of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). Recently, the school has also been planning to raise funds to build a gymnasium that can also serve as an auditorium. In addition, because the new school buildings have a wide foundation and are located in a quiet rural environment, the school scenery is very beautiful; and the layout of the campus, pavilions, lawns, and ponds is a good place for children to study and play.

In terms of equipment, the school provides a reasonable amount of teaching equipment, such as instruments, specimens, books, and sports equipment, every semester for use. According to the statistics of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the school has a total of 471 instruments, 212 specimens, 2745 reference books for teachers and staff, 2239 children's books, 726 sports and Boy Scout equipment, 4526 other equipment, and 3034 utensils.

### Yarn and Cotton

The Disastrous Fall of Sanpin Yarn Increases Unease in the Yarn Market

Warehouse Stockpiles Increase, Industry Tends to Dump, Spot Trends Are Smooth, but Pressure Is Heavy

The yarn market is weakening, and the decline has restarted, mainly because rumors about the paper money issue have subsided. At the same time, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market has plummeted, with the long-term contract breaking through the 40-yuan mark. This has shocked people, and sellers have sprung up, causing market prices to turn downstream. However, spot yarn buyers still have considerable demand, and the Sichuan yarn market is also developing. However, industry insiders, seeing the increasing stockpiles in warehouses, are only inclined to dump their goods.

Marked Yarn Falls by Two Yuan Strongly

In the early session of the marked yarn market, near-term contracts were firm due to Indian merchants taking delivery. Auctioning turned lower in long-term contracts. This was because the Osaka Sanpin yarn market was falling step by step, coupled with the paper money issue. Market rumors were relatively subdued, and people's minds were calm. However, this month, many parties released limited-price yarn at 55 yuan, so the market situation became more stable. However, most of the industry tends to dump their goods, and the pressure is also heavy. As a result, the prices of each month fell by 0.2 to 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, the market suddenly changed, as the Osaka Sanpin yarn market was unable to support itself, and the closing price fell, breaking through the 40-yuan mark. This made people panic, and sellers took the opportunity to put on high pressure, making the decline more obvious. As a result, the prices of each month fell by another 0.5 to 1.34 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price. According to the investigation, Jifeng sold 1,100 bales, Yudai 1,350 bales, Yiji 850 bales, Dachangcheng 2,500 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, Hengchang 1,700 bales, Hengyi 900 bales, Runkang 1,400 bales, Yongda 1,400 bales, and Shengyuan 550 bales. Dafu bought 1,100 bales, Zhenda 1,200 bales, Gengfeng 4,350 bales, Senkang 1,200 bales, Xiecheng 1,500 bales, Yudai 1,050 bales, Jinchang 1,600 bales, and Changji 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Sales to Sichuan Active

Spot yarn sales are good. According to statistics, all types of yarn dealers bought 2,398 bales throughout the day. The selling price is similar to the previous day. The purchase volume of each type is listed below.

Cotton Restrained by Yarn

The cotton market is mediocre and weakening, because American cotton is sluggish, and people are very frustrated. In the afternoon, as the yarn market fell step by step, the cotton market, which is closely related, was dragged into the whirlpool. The long-term contract broke through the 5-yuan mark.

Marked Cotton Falls by 0.65 Yuan

In the early session of the marked cotton market, the prices of each month saw a slight decline. Because American cotton fluctuated, up and down 2 to 5 points, Indian cotton was suspended, and the overseas cotton industry was still lackluster, the market situation was ordinary. At the same time, the yarn market declined, and buyers were scarce. As a result, the prices of each month fell by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, the market atmosphere was still peaceful. Subsequently, cotton prices fell, affected by the decline in yarn prices. At the close, the decline was fierce. As a result, the prices of each month fell by a large 0.45 to 0.5 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price. According to the investigation, Yikang sold 3,300 dan, Jifeng 2,900 dan, Hexing 2,700 dan, Renfeng 1,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,900 dan, Daji 1,000 dan, Changyu 2,100 dan, Yuanyi 2,400 dan, Yichang 3,000 dan, Changfeng 3,100 dan, Tonghe 1,400 dan, and Xingchang 1,700 dan. Yudai bought 14,400 dan, Jinchang 4,400 dan, Shenji 3,500 dan, Yuanyi 2,100 dan, Gengfeng 5,500 dan, Xinchang 3,600 dan, Tongji 1,300 dan, Deda 1,000 dan, and Changfeng 1,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Cotton Mill Offices Turn Dull

Spot cotton consumption has become depressed. Because the cotton futures have fallen, factories are stagnating, and sources have not yet opened up.

The Decline of Sanpin Yarn and Cotton is Intensifying

An Osaka telegram on the 18th stated that spot yarn fell by 2 to 5 yuan. 16-count Fanmian was 233 yuan, down 3 yuan. 20-count Jinyu was 253 yuan, down 2 yuan. 40-count Wuxing was 400 yuan, down 5 yuan. 42-count Zhizi was 378 yuan, down 4 yuan.

The near-term contract was 72.8 yuan, and the long-term contract was 74.15 yuan.

American New Cotton Sold by Foreign Firms

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with slightly active trading, mostly between industry insiders. Prices ranged from unchanged to a decrease of 3 points. The March contract fell due to long liquidation and hedging, then recovered due to purchases by industry insiders and cooperatives. Private estimates indicate that approximately 350,000 bales of pledged cotton were sold. News from Washington stated that the terms for selling pledged cotton by the Commodity Credit Corporation would not be changed at this time. At the close, the market was weak due to hedging and foreign firms selling new cotton. Spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures prices fell by 5 points to a gain of 3 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 1 point. Indian cotton trading was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 17th).

A telegram from Mumbai also stated that the opening forecast for the 18th was 222 rupees for Bairoxi, 203 rupees for Omra, and 177 rupees for Pingur, all down 1.5 rupees.

Yarn and Cloth Inventory Continues to Increase

The brand and count of the yarn are listed below.

### Piece Goods

Eastern Piece Goods Futures Open to May and June

Yesterday, the cloth market saw continued strong trading of Eastern piece goods, fine cloth, and fine twill by Tianjin dealers and local merchants. Japanese firms have opened futures to May and June. Yesterday, more than 500 packages of fine cloth with the "Longtou" brand were opened, and the price was comparable to the spot sales price. Tianjin and local dyed cloth dealers have collected nearly 1,000 pieces of spot and futures of fine cloth and fine twill. Therefore, although cotton yarn and cotton have continued to decline, market prices are still maintained strongly. Spot prices of white goods are uniformly firm. The market for Ding Biji and line tweed is gradually weakening due to seasonal factors. The price of Sijunzi Biji fell by 1.25 li per yard, and the remaining goods are also flat and weak. Local factories have continued to make frequent additions of fine cloth and fine twill to Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Anhui. Assorted goods such as pattern silk, plain silk, blue cloth, colored twill, line tweed, Biji, printed colored satin, and printed cloth are also selling well. Many Zhuang merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Shandong, Henan, and other places who are stationed in Shanghai have returned to their hometowns for the New Year and have not yet returned to Shanghai to handle goods. The Qingdao Textile Exchange opened the auction of standard Zhanqiao brand fine cloth from yesterday. The opening price before noon was 9.225 yuan, and the closing price was 9.275 yuan. The afternoon was flat.

### Securities

Rehabilitation Bonds Soar by Three Yuan Due to Lack of Spot Circulation

The Unified Rising Trend Seems to be Easing Slightly

Yesterday, the rising trend in the Chinese Securities Exchange had stopped, and the situation tended to be hovering. Longs still have a slow exit, and although there are entries, it is not as enthusiastic as before. The transmitted news is still in a daze, and the trend may be slightly smaller. People's hearts are still strong. There are not many days left this month, and the number of accounts is still huge. According to Nos. 10 and 43, etc., constantly selling, it may not be easy to rise again temporarily. Yesterday's process, the opening people's hearts are still good, and many retail investors bought in, and Nos. 5, 6, 10 and 43, etc. sold out one after another. Although the market price slightly increased by 3-4 jiao, the situation was not振. In the second round, the above companies continued to sell, No. 11 also turned into output, and Nos. 14, 38 and 54 slightly bought in. The market situation has slowly weakened, and most of them are slightly smaller by one or two jiao. The result is still a uniform rise of 0.15 to 0.4 yuan. Only Rehabilitation Bonds have very little trading. Because there is no spot circulation outside, the shorts have to cut their losses in pain, so they have soared by three yuan. This cannot be compared with the unified public bonds on the same day. The total number of transactions was 6,915,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).

### Grain

Flour Takes a Sharp Turn Downward

Floating Multiples Seem to Have Abandoned the Recent Period

Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the market in each month showed a trend of initial stability followed by a sharp decline. In terms of foreign wheat quotations, Chicago's recent period remained unchanged, and the long period was good for 1 or 2 jiao. Canada's near term also remained unchanged, and the long term was good for a quarter of a jiao. When opening, the foreign wheat quotation was still stable, and the opening price was similar to the previous one. However, this month is only about a week away from the delivery time, and the floating multiple chips on the market are still prosperous. Because of the smoothness of脱手, the market turned sharply downward, falling step by step. The reason is that although the factory has recovered recently, the actual sales route is not very greedy, so it is also emphasizing reality, and the longs have to give up. The new powder in July, due to the large influx of non-industry users, the degree of decline was reversed. According to this situation, the longs may be giving up the near term and seeking the long term, and the new and old may have a gradual divergence.

The Stock of Wheat in Various Roads is Still Plentiful, and the 期麥 Has Fallen Sharply by About One Jiao

Yesterday's period wheat market, after opening in the morning, the near-term market was still stable due to the slight vibration of foreign wheat quotations. The long-term new wheat was soft when it opened because the weather was normal and it was beneficial to wheat seedlings. After the second round, the powder market saw a sharp decline, and the stock of wheat in various roads was quite abundant. After the Spring Festival, there was a saying that there would be a steady flow of shipments to申, so people's hearts were empty, and the decline was also strong. The trend of dumping was very smooth for the new wheat because the weather was very good, and the decline turned crazy. For example, by the close of July, the huge amount of 1.5 jiao had fallen. In the subsequent situation, if the powder sales do not improve, the near term should follow the fall, and the new wheat in June and July will be greatly related to the weather. In the spot wheat market, because the standard has fallen again, the factory has suppressed the price, and each file has fallen by 7 or 8 points again. The opening Shandong Yanghe Guandian Bengbu Zhangbaling wheat is 6.63 yuan, Dongge wheat is 6.6 yuan, Jiangbei wheat is 6.578 yuan, Suqian Yaowan wheat is 6.4 yuan, second triangular, Nanjing wheat is 6.52 yuan, 5,000 packages are handled by Fuxin, and 8,000 packages are handled by Fufeng.

Standard Soybean Oil Cake is Over Supplied

Companies and Dalian Gang Have 套出

The standard soybean oil cake market is affected by Dalian, and the situation is gradually weakening. Dalian's telecommunications have gradually shrunk every day, and even spot goods such as L豆 have arrived in申 in whole batches. Companies and the Dalian Gang are both套出 in the market, and the actual sales are only handled by the local merchants. 客帮 lacks whole batch sales routes. Because the non-industry囤户 also dare not collect smoothly, the standard market price has gradually fallen, and the oil beans have fallen uniformly. The standard oil is 0.7 yuan, to 0.45 yuan, the standard cake is 1.23 yuan, and the standard beans are 0.13 yuan to 0.09 yuan.

The Stock in Dalian is Full

It is Difficult to be Optimistic about the Soybean Market

Yesterday, under the frequent declines in Dalian, the soybean market was unanimously downstream. The price of Si Pingjie beans plummeted. Oil factories took advantage of the cheap price to buy 26 cars, and the price was 6 yuan. At the moment, according to the Dalian market, it is even more difficult to be optimistic. The reason is that the stock in the port is full, and the sales 塲 of foreign plants are temporarily suspended. The bottom goods scattered in various places are bound to catch up during this spring warming and thawing, resulting in the above situation. This city is greatly affected, and other car beans are inevitably implicated. The main reason is that the sales 塲 of oil factories, car houses and garden workshops are bound to be occupied by Northeast beans, so the market has been panicked. Yesterday, only one car of Hui溪 Kou beans was opened, one car of Dingjia Zhou beans, and 1,200 packages of Hankou Zha beans, and 300 packages of Jiujiang Chi beans.

He Mi is Only More Popular in Yin Yuan Demand

(Hu Nan) Yesterday, a total of more than 30 houses arrived from various gangs, about 6,3400 stone of goods. Among them, there were 134 houses of Bo稲, and the sales 塲 of the local merchants was still sluggish, and the 包胃 was also the same. There was a slight movement after the price was cut slightly. Tianjin, Qingdao, Xi'an and other gangs handled more than 2,000 packages of Bo稲, but the market situation was still difficult to support. As a result, the thick japonica rice continued to fall, and the Bo稲 also depreciated by 0.1 to 0.1 yuan. Du Yangjian lacked goods and had no market. Yin Yuan arrived rarely and sold well, increasing by 0.1-0.2 yuan.

(Hu Bei) Yesterday, 267 ships arrived from various gangs under the river. There are quite a few ships in存under the river, and the shop stomach has not yet improved. The sales of each cargo are very small, the market shape is weak, the price of white japonica rice is weak, and the medium and low are slightly 0.1 yuan. The early rice has less goods and a flat price. Bo稲 is close to jiao, Yangjian price is jiao, Port Du Ke尖 and白元 price is weak, and the price of other goods is also weak.

Ke秈 Lacks Whole Batch Transactions

The Consignor is Discounting to Sell

Yesterday's Ke秈 market, although local customers continued to handle shipments, the situation was still lifeless. 客帮 Shantou is still alive, and 北洋 and Xi'an continue to handle shipments, but the number of shipments is small, and the 粤帮 with the most smooth sales is still not handling the whole ticket. It is said that the 粤省 is now well stocked and the market price has been falling step by step. Shanghai's market price is relatively high and it is still difficult to 합划, so it has not been handled for many days. 粤销 is dull, and people's hearts are more empty. The consignor, on the contrary, is full of arrival and on the way goods, intending to sell urgently, so the high rice continues to cut 0.56 points, and the medium and secondary rice is slightly 0.78 points to 0.1 points. 7,950 packages of赣米 were opened throughout the day, 150 packages of Xiang米, and there were no other transactions.

The Yichang fungus and the No. goods opened yesterday, and the price was 112 yuan. The Sichuan fungus has not yet opened. Now the water level of the Yangtze River is gradually rising, and the water feet is also reduced. The 후市 may have to turn slack.

### Silk and Tea

Moroccan Green Tea Sales Increase

The market conditions for Moroccan green tea have been unusually buoyant recently. British trading firms in this city have received news that the medium- and low-grade "Zhen Mei" teas, specifically those that sold for over 50 yuan per shipment last year and those from domestic sources at 30+ yuan, are now selling very well in the market. Furthermore, items such as "Zhen Mei" and "Xiu Mei" teas are also being actively traded. The price of "Zhu Cha" tea is also quite firm. However, high-grade "Zhen Mei" tea is experiencing slow sales due to the poor market conditions. It is feared that goods priced around 100 yuan in the Shanghai market will be difficult to move.

### Hardware

Over Five Hundred Boxes of Lead-Tin Alloy Sold

The sales of lead-tin alloy have surged since the Lunar New Year. Factories producing thermos bottles, cigarettes, toys, and biscuits are all vying to purchase it, resulting in a significant increase in transactions. Yesterday, sales reached a remarkable 500+ boxes. Large-sized sheets are selling for 35 yuan, while small-sized sheets are selling for 33.5 yuan, representing an increase of 4-5 yuan compared to last year.

No Transactions After Pure Antimony Priced at 900 Yuan

Since the guild increased the listed price of pure antimony to 900 yuan, export trading firms and manufacturers have shown no interest in procurement. Consequently, the market has become stagnant, surpassing all other hardware items in inactivity. Fortunately, the limited supply and positive market sentiment have helped maintain the price and prevent it from falling.

### Sundries

Shortage of Haikou Cowhide in the Market

Since the beginning of spring, there has been a shortage of Haikou cowhide. Products such as "Sha Hong Pi" and "Hong Shui Qing" are out of stock. The previous market trend was very favorable, with a consistent upward movement. "Sha Hong Pi" was priced at approximately 80 yuan, and "Hong Shui Qing" at approximately 55-56 yuan. A small amount of "Bai Shui Qing" is available in stock, and the price opened at 68 yuan yesterday, an increase of 3-4 yuan. Guangxi goods are of better quality and can be priced at 75 yuan in the current market.

Various charitable organizations in Shanghai, including the Joint Disaster Relief Association, initiated a relief effort for the American flood disaster. It was previously decided to first remit 100,000 yuan in cash and allocate another 100,000 yuan to purchase various domestic daily necessities for delivery to the American flood victims.

### British Firm Marconi & Co. Secures Entire Guangzhou Water Plant Project

Construction Cost of HK$2.8 Million; Entire Project to be Completed Within One Year

Last year, newspapers reported that the Guangzhou Municipal Government's massive project to expand the Guangzhou Water Plant, valued at 3.15 million yuan, was contracted to the British firm Marconi & Co. It is now known that the formal contract for this project has recently been signed. The two parties signing the contract are Marconi & Co. and Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Yangfu. It is understood that the project will commence shortly and, upon completion, will be one of the leading water plants in East Asia, boasting unparalleled and comprehensive facilities. The various features of the plant are briefly described below:

New Plant Location

The plant will be rebuilt on the original site of the old plant along the Pearl River in Zengbu. The content includes a power generation room, water intake room, sedimentation room, clean water reservoir, and twelve Shanghai water pools. The daily output will reach 30 million gallons, which will be sufficient to meet the maximum drinking water needs of all residents in Guangzhou. To further ensure the enterprise's success, a large reservoir with a capacity of 2.5 million gallons is being built in the urban area of Guangzhou to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Guangzhou is situated near mountains and rivers, boasting exceptional scenic beauty. The project planners are taking advantage of this natural terrain to construct another reservoir on the mountains near the city, using

Natural Pressure

to supply water to tall buildings throughout the city without the aid of pumps. If pumps were required to achieve the desired water pressure throughout Guangzhou, the number needed and their value would be substantial. This design will greatly benefit the future of the new plant. The plant is equipped with three high-pressure water pumps for pumping water into the city and three low-pressure pumps for drawing water from the river. One of the most innovative aspects is that the entire plant will be managed by

Mechanical Management

without any manual labor. All twelve filter pools will be managed from a central control point but can also be managed separately. Each filter pool is equipped with an automatic recorder to indicate the water quality status. Managers can see the conditions at a glance. The plant recognizes that

Water Disinfection

is of paramount importance to public health. Therefore, this aspect was given special attention during planning. Two modern, state-of-the-art chlorine disinfection machines are installed, with one used for disinfection and the other serving as a backup in case of damage to the primary machine, ensuring that disinfection is not interrupted and preventing unsanitary drinking water. The meticulousness and detail are evident. A 42-inch trunk pipe is one of the most

Important Equipment

This pipe is essential for connecting the water plant to the upper reservoir, allowing it to connect to the city's water pipe network in the future. In addition to a two-story office building, the plant will have all necessary facilities such as a chemical testing laboratory, repair room, and warehouse. This massive project is limited to completion within one year, with water output required by the summer of next year. The primary steel frame drawings for the project have been completed by Marconi & Co. Marconi & Co. previously completed a large water plant project for the Macau Water Company. The Guangzhou water plant project will be handled by the same machinery, technicians, and staff used in the Macau water plant project, ensuring a smooth and rapid completion. The Guangzhou water plant

Total Cost

is HK$2.8 million, including £81,000 for the purchase of machinery and filtration equipment. Marconi & Co. plans to send a specialist to England soon to inspect the various components. The signing of this contract is a testament to the strong Sino-British relations and demonstrates cooperative progress.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Concludes Yangtze River Navigation Conference

Branch Managers Gather in Shanghai, Shallow Water Fees Reduced by 15-50%

The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a successful year in shipping last year, generating substantial profits. The Yangtze River route, in particular, saw an exceptionally high volume of goods. To further develop the business, Cai Zengji, Shen Zhongyi, Lao Mian, and other general and deputy managers convened a conference on the 15th of this month in Shanghai, inviting branch managers from various ports along the Yangtze River to discuss

Development of Yangtze Business

Branch managers who responded to the call to attend the conference in Shanghai included Yin Huichang from Hankou, Shen Huating from Jiujiang, Tan Shulian from Anqing, Wen Quyuan from Wuhu, Shi Fuchang from Nanjing, Xin Yaoxiang from Zhenjiang, Yang Yunhe from Changsha, and Xu Rendong from Shashi. They have all arrived in Shanghai to attend the conference. Starting this week, General Manager Cai Zengji will chair the meetings, with department heads and branch managers attending to discuss the development of Yangtze River operations. At that time, the

Managers of Each Branch Proposed Many Motions

Which, when summarized, primarily focused on the congestion of goods on the Yangtze River and the company's lack of ships, with insufficient tonnage to allocate, preventing full cargo capacity. New ships must be built first to replenish the Yangtze River route. Additionally, local lighters are old and have small capacities, requiring the construction of new lighters to be deployed in Anqing, Datong, Wuhu, and Wuxue. Furthermore, with the daily congestion of goods to and from various ports along the Yangtze River, new warehouses must be added. Also, new ships must be built on the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River to connect navigation and expand business, etc. Many motions were made and, after

Three Days of Discussion

The proposals for adding ships, building lighters, constructing warehouses, and developing business were all passed. Several cases are still pending. The Yangtze River conference concluded yesterday, and the resolutions will be implemented gradually. The branch managers from various locations along the Yangtze River are still in Shanghai and are expected to return to their respective bureaus in Jing, Wu, Wan, Xun, Han, Sha, and Yi in the next day or two. Due to rising water levels upstream and downstream, the Hunan route is now open. The six companies agreed to reduce shallow water fees between Shanghai and Hankou by 10% from today. The shallow water fees on the Changsha line will also be reduced by 50%.

### Public Welfare Yarn Factory Workers Strike Yesterday Morning

Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Mediation for This Morning

According to Da Gong She, the Public Welfare Yarn Factory at 150 Labor Sheng Road in West Shanghai recently eliminated some work in the cone winding section, laying off all 300+ workers, which caused a reaction from the workers who demanded to be reinstated. Otherwise, they would want to be paid six months' worth of severance pay, but this was not accepted by the factory management, which has been delayed for an unresolved amount of time. The 400+ workers in the roving and spinning rooms of the factory declared a strike in unison at 6:00 AM yesterday to show their support, and all work was stopped. However, the weaving mill section still operates normally. After the workers went on strike, they elected four representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the third department, received them and immediately dispatched staff member Zhang Chuqiang to mediate with the factory in the afternoon. The responsible representatives of the employees then went to the City Party Headquarters to petition, making mediation impossible. Inquiries were made to the factory to find out the truth, and it was said that the cone winding section was a contracted system, and the factory only had relations with the foremen, while all the workers were not directly employed by the factory, and it was really impossible to pay severance pay. However, in order to alleviate the suffering of the workers, they were allowed to be paid for a month or two. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to send representatives from the Party Department to mediate again this morning to solve the matter as soon as possible.

### Workers at New Yu No. 1 Factory Resumed Work Yesterday Morning

According to Da Gong She, workers in the fine spinning room of the New Yu Textile Company No. 1 Factory at 37 Suzhou Road in West Shanghai went on strike at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday because they wanted the factory to add double pay for the New Year and rest time, but this was not done. After the strike workers were persuaded by members sent by the labor union, they resumed work yesterday morning. The questions required will be negotiated directly with the factory to find a solution.

### Wang Chonghui Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Member of the Central Committee, Wang Chonghui, went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and originally planned to return to Shanghai after the closing. It is learned that Wang felt slightly unwell after arriving in Beijing, so he returned to Shanghai by night express train yesterday morning, and then went to see a doctor for treatment. After his body is fully recovered, he will go to Beijing again.

### He Zhuguo Passed Through Shanghai and Entered Beijing Yesterday Morning

He Zhuguo, who went south a few days ago to report on the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu to the Central Government, flew from Beijing to Hangzhou on the 15th, and then went to Fenghua Xikou via the Fengxin Highway on the 16th to meet Zhang Xueliang, who was in seclusion, and inquire about his daily life. On the 17th, he took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Jiangtian Wheel to Shanghai and arrived here yesterday morning. It is heard that He has entered Beijing that day, and will visit Chairman Chiang and Minister He again to ask about the issue of the defense area of the Northeast Army.

### Shou Jingwei Returned to Shanghai Yesterday to Advance to Beijing Again

Preparing to Establish a China Tea Company, Going to Anhui, Jiangxi, and Other Provinces to Contact

In order to develop Chinese tea, the Ministry of Industry plans to establish the China Tea Company and jointly organize it with the authorities of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces. The total amount of capital is set at 2 million yuan in national currency, and Shou Jingwei is entrusted to prepare everything. The articles of association have been drafted and announced in Beijing. Shou was in Beijing before, asking the Ministry for instructions on everything, and the case has been completed. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, and still took the night express train to Beijing that night. According to him, after going to Beijing, he will set off to contact various places the next day, first going to Anhui, and then to Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in two weeks. The authorities of all provinces have replied by telegram expressing their approval. After returning to Shanghai from various places, I will discuss the division of labor and cooperation and the development of tea export trade with Chinese and foreign tea merchants in Shanghai. The general company will be established in Shanghai, and is expected to be established in two months.

The Ministry of Industry sent a telegram to the chairmen of the governments of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces: "Dear brother ××, I would like to ask you to help me. Tea is a major national product and is world-renowned, but the tea varieties are not improved, the manufacturing methods are not improved, the quality is getting worse, the standards are not followed, and the transportation and management are not proper, resulting in overseas sales being encroached upon and the number of exports is decreasing every year. In recent years, officials and people in tea-producing provinces have asked for ways to improve in order to provide relief. After repeated research by the Ministry, we have drafted a method to initiate the organization of a China Tea Company jointly run by officials and businessmen in tea-producing provinces and regions, and officials and people will work together to improve the production, manufacture, transportation and sales of tea, so as to promote overseas trade. A member of the Economic Construction General Association and Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Shou Jingwei, has been specially dispatched to visit your province with a draft of the articles of association for a detailed explanation. If you agree, you plan to set up a preparatory committee and appoint the directors of the construction halls of the six provinces and the directors of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, Shou Wei Chang, and others, nine people, as members of the preparatory committee, to prepare and proceed together. It is also planned to ask your province to undertake 40,000 yuan in shares, half of which can be raised by your province to solicit business shares and urge tea merchants and financiers to share them, and pay the shares in two installments. Only one-half of the shares will be collected at the beginning of the operation, in order to make it easier for everyone to lift and plan for progress. This is a special message, and I hope to reply by telegram. Minister of Industry, Wu Dingchang, fish tap,

### Inner River Steamer Liheng Sunk by Waves

Salvage Operation is Underway

After the Inner River China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau was ordered to suspend operations, all the small steamers and company ships on the Su, Song, Tai, Hang, Jia and Hu lines have been successively taken over by the bureau and opened to Shanghai. Fourteen small steamers and thirteen company ships have arrived in Shanghai and are all stopped in Longhua and other places. There are still five small steamers and five company ships in the Zhenjiang Huaiyang area, and Bureau member Qian Xiangshan has been sent to take over them and will arrive in Shanghai soon. When all arrive, they will be sold by bid. One of the small steamers that has arrived in Shanghai, Li Heng, was anchored in Yangsi Port. The wind and waves were quite strong the day before, and the Li Heng's hull was overwhelmed by the waves and water entered, and the ship sank into the port. After the watchman reported to the bureau, staff have been sent to verify that it is true, and salvage operations are underway.

### Eurasia Company Sets Up Station in Nanzheng

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1390: "Now approved, Eurasia Airlines函略开, by the order of the Ministry, a station will be set up in Nanzheng (Hanzhong). Every shift of planes will stop at this station. However, Hanzhong's terrain is mountainous, and the airport is like in an urn. If the weather is bad, it cannot land at all. At that time, the mail to the station will have to be taken to the next station, and then taken back when the plane returns, until it can land, in order to ensure safety, etc., it is approved. This notice is given to everyone to know about it. This notice, Director Zha Peilin, February 17th."

### National Sugar Production and Sales Association Asks to Change the Sugar Ball Tax Rate

More than Half Lower Than White Sugar, Damaging Tariffs and National Sugar

Last year, 269,835 dans of sugar were smuggled in North China. The loss of national tax was very large, and because China's investigation and suppression was severe, it was not satisfied. Recently, the China National Sugar Production and Sales Association reported that Qingdao investigators from the Shandong Puyi Sugar Factory reported that various sugar balls were transported from Dalian to Qingdao in large numbers, with different colors and patterns. This kind of goods is said to be made of coarse sugar, and the local price in Dalian is about 9 yuan per 100 kilograms. Qinghai Customs estimates that the tax is 4.15 yuan per 100 kilograms, plus a surtax of 14.15 yuan, totaling 4.565 yuan per gold unit, which is about 10.045 yuan in national currency. Compared with the import tax of white sugar, it is more than half lower. If it is allowed to be imported, it will reduce tariff revenue and affect the sales of national sugar. The impact is not light. After the China National Sugar Production and Sales Association received the report, they believed that since the sugar balls are condensed from coarse sugar, the substance is only different in size from the coarse sugar, and there is no difference. It is obviously intentional to confuse and try to trick tariffs, so the association has presented to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the tariff on the sugar balls be levied according to the coarse sugar tax rate in order to maintain tax revenue and national sugar.

### Last Year's Tea Export Statistics

The Total Number Has Increased Compared to the Previous Year, Brick Tea Exports Have Greatly Declined

According to Xin Xin She, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau announced that the total amount of Chinese tea exported from Shanghai in 1936 (including Hankou tea, which was transshipped through Shanghai) was 297,174.76 quintals, which is still far behind the 73,000 quintals in 1934, but it increased by more than 6,800 quintals compared with 1935, which shows that the external export of Chinese tea has turned to a path of recovery, but the future still needs the efforts of the tea industry. As far as the export status of various teas is concerned, the export of red tea, green tea and other teas have increased compared with 1935, especially the increase in green tea is the largest. It is found that the export of green tea to Africa was very prosperous last year, and it is the only market for Chinese green tea today. Its development is just beginning, but it is said that green tea from a certain country is trying to seize the market there, and has recently used dumping policies to actively develop sales. This is very worthy of the attention of our tea industry. As for the export of brick tea, it has greatly declined. It is found that brick tea is mostly transported to the Soviet Union. In recent years, the Soviet Union has also had large-scale tea operations, and it is gradually becoming self-sufficient. The loss of this major customer has a great impact on Chinese tea.

### National Handicraft Exhibition

Exhibits Sent from All Parties are Reviewed by the Organizing Committee

The Shanghai Municipal Government received a letter from the National Economic Construction Movement Committee for the organization of a national handicraft exhibition, and the solicitation of exhibits was ordered by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to set up an office to solicit various handicrafts from national product manufacturers in Shanghai. According to news from the Social Affairs Bureau, since the start of solicitation, the applicants from all parties have been very enthusiastic. As it concerns the national industry, the bureau will organize a review committee to carefully review the exhibits sent by all parties. It was originally planned to hold a preview in mid-March, but it is feared that the time will be too late, or after sending to Beijing to participate in the exhibition, the national exhibits will be transported to Shanghai for a second national handicraft exhibition.

### Chinese Representatives to Participate in the International Textile Industry Conference Will Soon Be Selected

All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and Other Organizations Will Hold a Meeting on the 21st to Invite Textile Industry Leaders to Discuss Everything

According to the Central News Agency, the International Textile Industry Tripartite Conference convened by the International Labor Bureau is scheduled to be held in Washington, DC on April 2. China has been invited to participate. The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the General Federation of Industry will invite textile industry leaders to discuss everything on the 22nd. The details are as follows:

Scheduled Discussion

After receiving the order from the Ministry of Industry, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce planned to invite all relevant parties to discuss the selection of representatives. Yesterday, it received an order from the Ministry of Industry stating that the US ambassador had sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inviting participation, and US Ambassador Johnson personally invited Foreign Minister Zhang Qun to select representatives as soon as possible. Therefore, the association, together with the General Federation of Industry of China, will hold a meeting at the Bank Association at noon on the 22nd, inviting textile giants to discuss. According to Lin Kanghou, who told reporters that the meeting time is approaching, and everything must be done as soon as possible, so textile industry leaders are specially invited to discuss the delegation of representatives and other issues. It is heard that Wang Zhisheng, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, took the night express train to Beijing last night to visit the officials of the Ministry of Industry to ask for instructions on everything.

Instruction from the Ministry of Industry

The instruction from the Ministry of Industry to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is as follows: "According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' letter No. 1279 of January 10, 1937, the US ambassador's letter states: 'When the International Labor Conference holds its 30th session, the US representative proposed to convene a tripartite meeting of the international textile industry to discuss ways to improve the social problems involved in the textile industry, which has been approved by the conference, and the International Labor Bureau has resolved that the meeting will be held in Washington on April 2, 1937. The Chinese government is specially invited to send representatives to participate,' etc. Subsequently, US Ambassador Johnson invited the Minister in person to send representatives and technical experts to participate in the meeting, and said, 'The US government firmly believes that China's textile industry is an important part of the national economy, so it is very willing for the Chinese government to participate in the meeting,' etc. Whether China should send representatives to participate in the meeting, please check and reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing, etc. It is approved. It is found that this case has been notified to the association before, and it has been approved that the association, together with the China General Federation of Industry, should select representatives in accordance with the usual practice, and raise the attendance expenses on its own. Therefore, it should immediately determine the candidate list of representatives and submit it to the Ministry for review and handling. This is a special notice."

### Silk and Satin Guild and Others Petition to Maintain the Original Plan for Clothing Regulations Regarding Robes and Mandarin Jackets

Will Send Representatives to Petition in the Capital

The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild, the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Factory Industry Guild, on behalf of overseas Chinese Chen Jiageng, petitioned the Ministry of Interior to abolish robes and mandarin jackets in the Clothing Regulations, requesting a re-amendment, believing it is greatly related to the national economy and people's livelihood. They first telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industry, saying: "To President Chiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Chiang of the Ministry of Interior, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Your Excellencies: We have found that men's and women's formal and casual wear have already been clearly stipulated in the Clothing Regulations by Your Ministries. The use of domestic materials for casual wear was also clearly promulgated by the National Government on April 16, 1929. Since its implementation, the people have found it convenient, and our government has repeatedly emphasized and earnestly promoted it. However, recent newspapers have reported that some people, with a biased view and seeking novelty, have petitioned Your Ministries to re-regulate men's and women's formal and casual wear. Upon hearing this news, we are deeply concerned about the national economy and people's livelihood and cannot help but tremble. According to the reasons they have stated, they say that long robes and mandarin jackets are remnants of the Qing Dynasty's clothing system, and continuing to follow and use them will indeed affect national psychology and hinder national rejuvenation. However, Dr. Sun Yat-sen created the Republic, uniting the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan peoples into one family. The Han and Tang clothing of our country in the past are not suitable for modern times. Therefore, incorporating habits and considering domestic products, long robes and mandarin jackets are suitable for the colors of the Eastern nation. If it is said that the Manchu legacy affects national psychology, it is tantamount to rejecting the Manchu people from the nation, regarding Manchuria as not our country's territory, and cutting off the Manchu people's psychology of revolting against the Qing and returning to the Republic. Therefore, wearing robes and mandarin jackets has no impact on psychology. If it is said to hinder national rejuvenation, then the clothing systems of various countries have their own special circumstances and their own national products. During the Meiji Restoration in Japan, everything was reformed, but the kimono with wide sleeves and wooden clogs remained the same and did not hinder its rise and strength. Our country's silk has a long history and culture and is a sideline of agriculture. Using it for formal wear is dignified and solemn, and using it for casual wear is luxurious and comfortable. It can express the spirit of the country and promote natural domestic products. Therefore, the revival of the nation depends on this. Wearing robes and mandarin jackets is precisely for the purpose of reviving the nation and does not hinder it in any way. As for the inconvenience of movement and work compared to short clothes, formal wear values solemnity and does not prioritize convenience. Casual wear also follows each person's habits. Even if it needs to be slightly modified, it should be based on domestic products. At a time when national silk is declining and foreign goods are being dumped, the government is doing its best to promote it for the sake of the country and the people. It is already worried about the influx of foreign materials, so how can we not consider the root and address the symptoms, and further obstruct and lead to decline? Your Ministries have great wisdom and comprehensive planning, and will strive to take the lesser of two evils and choose the greater of two benefits. You will not be alarmed by alarming words and disregard the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, we especially telegraph to request the maintenance of the original plan for clothing regulations. The future of the nation and the vitality of domestic products truly depend on it. We are deeply concerned and await your orders. Luo Qinghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild; Cai Shengbai, Chairman of the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Factory Industry Guild, bow and sigh." It is heard that the guild has nominated representatives such as Luo Qinghua and will soon go to the capital to petition.

### Citywide Taxi Drivers Demand Improved Treatment

Trade Union Convened a Meeting Yesterday

The Dagong News Agency reported that the drivers and workers of major taxi companies in this city, such as Yunfei, Xiangsheng, Tailai, and Gonghe, have filed petitions with the Shanghai Taxi Drivers Union, stating their hardships and demanding that they propose improved treatment to the capitalists.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Statement

Rumors of Road Worker Layoffs Are Inaccurate

The Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Secretary-General's Office issued a message stating that the Chinese newspapers in this city had previously published news about the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department laying off road workers, and that the details were largely inconsistent with the facts. The Shanghai Municipal Council officially issued a statement to correct the following:

Two weeks ago, a message was published in the Chinese newspapers, saying that 90% of the road workers employed by the Public Works Department of this Council would be eliminated. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, the newspapers also published that this Council would draw lots to reduce road workers on February 28th, etc. All these details are completely inaccurate.

This Council has not yet discussed laying off road workers. The above news can be believed to have been fabricated by certain individuals who falsely claimed that this Council would lay off workers and made concessions after negotiations, with the intention of defrauding money from the workers.

As for the details about working hours and wages reported in the newspapers, they are also inconsistent with the facts. The actual working hours for workers are 8.5 hours per day in winter and 9 hours per day in summer. The wages for first-class workers are 65 cents per day. Half pay is given for two days or holidays when no work is done, and full pay is given when work is done. The Spring Festival is closed for three days each year, and the Dragon Boat Festival is closed for one day. Full wages are given for each holiday, and double wages are given for those who work as usual. This is the actual situation.

Yu Youyuan, a deceased wealthy merchant from Huizhou who lived in Shanghai, with the courtesy name of Ri Xiang, died of illness in 1933, leaving behind an inheritance of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Recently, his second daughter-in-law, Yu Zhan Yijuan, hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to sue the District Court to order her husband's brother, Yu Muhun, to hand over the accounts for inspection in order to divide the property. The court hearing was held at 3:00 PM yesterday. The plaintiff, Yu Zhan Yijuan, stated that she married the defendant's younger brother, Qingsheng, through a matchmaker. Unfortunately, her husband passed away the year after her father-in-law died. Therefore, the ancestral Shanghai Xiaonanmen outside Sangyuan Street Yu Youyuan Ink Factory and real estate, Guangzhou Cao Sugong Ink Shop, and three buildings and land in Hejianong Lane inside Shanghai Xiaoximen, and three buildings and land in Dalin Road Gu Sanli, and the money deposited in banks and money shops, are all managed by her husband's brother, Yu Muhun. He moved to a new house with his wife and wasted money at will, abandoning the plaintiff. She also heard that the defendant had moved all the important books and documents to other places, clearly intending to conceal or alter them. She requested that the court order him to hand them over.

### Younger Brother Steals, Older Sister Asks for Additional Punishment

Misled by Bad Friends, Stole Legal Tender and Gold Jewelry; Judge Tried to Persuade to Withdraw the Complaint, But the Sister Refused

Xu Yuehua, a female student at the Aesthetic Girls' Middle School from Hangzhou, is 21 years old and lived with her mother in her hometown. Because she came to Shanghai to study, she came to Shen with her younger brother, Xu Zhicheng (20 years old), and lived in the house of her cousin at No. 8 Tongchunfang, Lane 38, Baker Road. At 9:20 PM on the 11th, Xu Yuehua went out and returned home at about 10:00 PM. She found that her legal tender of 40 yuan and a

gold bracelet

worth 130 yuan were missing. At that time, Xu Zhicheng was also nowhere to be found. The maid told her that she had just seen Zhicheng carrying a bag out. Therefore, she was sure that Zhicheng had stolen it. Because he did not return for a long time, she reported it to the Xinzha Patrol House. Hua Detective Ye Yushan investigated and learned that Xu Zhicheng was hiding in Room 13 of the Zhonghua Hotel at No. 387 Avenue Edward VII. He went to investigate, but there was no trace of Zhicheng in the room. There were only two young men, Mao Jinmao and Hu Shijie, in the room. After questioning them, there were also

no clues.

He had to apply to the First Special District Court for an arrest warrant. Until 12:40 PM the night before last, Xu Zhicheng suddenly returned home. Xu Danhua reported it to the patrol house, and Mountain Leaf Detective brought him to the patrol house. Under questioning, he confessed that before the theft, he met Mao Jinmao and Hu Shijie at the Daxin Amusement Park. At that time, the two men said that one worked in a hotel and the other worked for the Hangyuan Railway Bureau. Under the instigation of the two men, he stole his sister's gold bracelet and legal tender. He first stayed at the Zhonghua Hotel. On the 12th, he went to

Jiaxing

to play, stayed in a hotel. Mao and others stole all of Xu's legal tender and fled. He had no choice but to return home alone. The detective asked where the gold bracelet was. He replied that it had been pledged at Qingyuan Silver Shop, No. 500 Hankou Road, for 90 yuan, which was also stolen by Mao and others. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Court. Patrol House lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for theft under Articles 320 and 324 of the Criminal Law. Because the stolen goods had not yet been recovered, he

asked for a postponement.

Xu Zhicheng confessed to the theft without denial. The presiding judge, Zhan Liangce, considered that the plaintiff and the defendant in this case were siblings. Therefore, he persuaded Xu Yuehua to consider the relationship between siblings and withdraw the complaint after the defendant was reprimanded in court. However, Xu Yuehua firmly refused, saying that she was afraid that her brother's behavior would become more improper in the future and damage the reputation of her parents. Therefore, she asked the court to give him a slight punishment. At a minimum, he must be granted probation after serving his sentence. Judge Zhan then ruled that the case would be adjourned for two days for further hearing.

### Qian Chengxu Talks About Bata's Mission to China

Large-Scale Purchase of Chinese Shoe Materials and Establishment of a Large Shoe Factory in Shanghai

New Sound News Agency reports: Bata, the world's shoe king, set off from Zilin, Czech Republic, last December with his secretary, engineers, and more than a dozen other people on a private plane. He then inspected the business of his branches in South Africa and Morocco. He recently arrived in Hong Kong from Singapore and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at dawn on the 21st of this month. He is scheduled to stay at the International Hotel. Qian Chengxu, the manager of the China Machine Shoe Factory, will host a reception for Bata on the 24th to renew old friendships. According to Qian, Bata's mission to China this time is: First, the price of cotton and silk fabrics in the Czech Republic is expensive, and the shoe materials required are very uneconomical to purchase in Europe. This time, he will purchase Chinese silk and cotton fabrics on a large scale, or sign long-term supply contracts with Chinese factories. The turnover will be at least 400,000 yuan per year. Second, Bata has been actively attacking the American shoe market since 1934. Now, the Czech Republic has no sea transportation exports and must borrow from neighboring countries, which is very inconvenient in terms of transportation and causes a lot of business losses. Therefore, he recently plans to set up a large shoe factory with a capital of more than 5 million yuan in Shanghai, purchase a large number of cheap Chinese leather, silk, and cotton shoe-making materials, and dump them on the American market, preparing to hold the key to the world's shoe industry. In this regard, the China Machine Shoe Factory currently produces 250 pairs of Zhongzi shoes per day, and will soon have more than 1,000 pairs. With this foundation, future cooperation between the two parties is actually possible. The establishment of the China Machine Shoe Factory in those days was remotely due to his visit to the Bata Shoe Factory in the past. It is said that Bata will be delayed for three days after arriving in China and will have to go to Japan and transfer to the United States to return home.

### Dasheng Hospital Abortion Case, Police Request Severe Punishment

The Court Heard the Case Yesterday and Scheduled Sentencing

Li Jingzhen, a local woman from Shaoxing, who lived at No. 97 Yongyuli, Beile Road, was 25 years old. Because Wen Gui often did business in Tianjin, Jingzhen lived in Shanghai and had an affair with Shen Fusheng, and built another golden house at No. 673 Baoxingli, Beile Road. Because she was four months pregnant, she went to Dasheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital at No. 200 Sapesai Road on the afternoon of the 4th of this month through the introduction of her girlfriend Xue Kebin and asked for an abortion. Due to poor surgical skills,

Internal Injuries

she died. The French Patrol House arrested the female doctor Yan Pinzheng, the nurse Gu Shaoqin, and Xue Kebin, who introduced and helped with the abortion, and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The body was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy. The reports have been published in this newspaper many times. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special Court continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Gu Shouxu, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case and prosecuted the three defendants for the crime of

performing an abortion for profit

resulting in death under Article 290, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. When asked, the defendant Yan Pinzheng said that the deceased had an abortion elsewhere. Because the placenta was falling, she came to my place to ask for treatment. She was bleeding non-stop, and it was not me who performed the abortion. Gu Shaoqin said, "I only helped to get the instruments and did not do anything." Xue Kebin denied that the deceased and her uncle came to my door and asked me to go out. The deceased said that she was bleeding due to a collision that damaged her pregnancy and asked me to

accompany her to the hospital.

I accompanied her and did not help with the abortion. Then, the witness Hu Chenshi (the second landlord in the small house) testified that the deceased said a week ago that she was going to have an abortion. I tried to dissuade her. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, she came with Miss Xue and said to me again that she was going to have an abortion today. According to her, she had already had a physical examination at the hospital and it was okay to have an abortion. At that time, only two injections were needed and the fetus would come down without any danger. She also said that Miss Xue had had an abortion before. At that time, Xue was also nearby saying that there was no danger in having an abortion. Then,

I, the deceased's

uncle, Xue Xiao, and the deceased took a rickshaw to Dasheng Hospital. The doctor and Miss Xue and the other three put on white clothes and started working. They told me to go back, so I went home. At 12:00 at night, I was not feeling well, so I asked my sister Xia Chenshi to visit. At 6:00 the next morning, someone from the hospital came to inform me that the deceased was dead. I also asked the deceased's family's maid, Chu Zhang, who said that I knew that the mistress was pregnant and had not had a miscarriage. On the afternoon of the 4th, I went out with Miss Xue.

People are very good.

On the 5th, Miss Xue and people from the hospital came together and said that the mistress was dead. At that time, they did not say anything about the abortion. At this point, the court considered that the case was clear and ordered the opening of the debate. Gu Shouxu, a lawyer from the Medical Office, argued that according to the testimony of the price check and the treaders, the defendant did intend to make a profit by performing an abortion, resulting in death. Although the defendants denied the abortion, there were still blood stains on the copied instruments, and the forensic doctor verified that the deceased's

Uterus

had many internal injuries. Although the defendants are trying to deny it, the facts are all there, so they should be severely punished according to the law. The second and third defendants should also be sentenced to criminal punishment according to the law for helping and constituting the crime of causing death. In recent years, I don’t know how many people have died in society due to abortions. There are also cases where hospitals are used to make profits by performing abortions, causing ignorant women to die prematurely. If we do not punish them severely, how can we warn the future? Then, after the defendants’ lawyers, Lan Xuzhang and Wang Shizong, defended them, the court debate ended and the defendants were ordered to be remanded to custody for sentencing on the morning of the 22nd.

### Chen Yunlong Attempted to Rape Daughter, Failed

Falsely Accused Lin Li

Mao Ye, a woman from Haimen, 48 years old, lives in the front building at No. 244 Fuyou Road in the city. She only has one daughter, named Xiufen, who is now 20 years old and unmarried. Chen Yunlong, a 22-year-old man from Rugao who lives in the rear building of the house, coveted Xiufen. However, the girl was as cold as ice. It happened that Mao Ye returned to her hometown for business. Chen Yunlong thought it was an opportunity and was extremely daring. Late at night on the 13th of this month, he tiptoed into Xiufen's room and, while the girl was asleep, uncovered the quilt and attempted to rape her. Xiufen woke up from her sleep and immediately shouted for help. Neighbors heard the sound and went to inquire. Chen saw that things were not going well and slipped away. Yesterday, Mao Ye returned to Shanghai and Xiufen cried and told her what happened. Ms. Mao then dragged Chen Yunlong to the Yi Miao Police Station. According to the defendant, he confessed that because he could not hook up with her, the landlady (Lin Li) taught me to first commit adultery. If she becomes pregnant, she will be a matchmaker for me and I will not be afraid of failure. Then, Lin Li was summoned and said that she did not instigate him and was falsely accused. The case was related to the attempted rape and was sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.

### Buddhist Nun from Xiaochang Temple Sues for Selling Temple Property

Ni Juehui, the abbess of Xiaochang Temple in Zhenru Town, 61 years old, from Yangzhou, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the District Court against Jin Ouyang, the wife of the deceased temple director Jin Souxia, and Li Dianliang, Li Boyin, Lu Xiqing, Li Mao, Yang Rulin, Pu Shaoting, and the bailiff Li Baosheng, for stealing and encroaching on the ancient temple property, stating that there were temple properties including ten diagrams of land, twelve plots of Tangziwei, and 3.75 acres of land owned by Master Faming. She has been in charge of the land. Because of the January 28th Shanghai War, she asked the temple director Jin Souxia to take care of the land deed. After Jin passed away, the plaintiff repeatedly asked Jin's wife for it without success. Therefore, she investigated the Land Bureau and discovered that the seven defendants colluded with the bailiff Li Baosheng to stamp the seal and privately sold it to the municipal government for 3,690 yuan. She requested investigation and prosecution, and attached a civil lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu held a court hearing. The plaintiff asked the proxy lawyer to state the case. The defendant, Jin Ouyang, Buddhist, who lives at No. 26 Chuanxin Street, said that Xiaochang Temple is a family temple. The land belongs to my family. The Fang Dan has been in charge of it since my late husband. The three acres of land were purchased by the municipal government. On December 12th last year, we seven people received it. The money is deposited with me and is prepared to be used to rebuild the temple. Li Dianliang said that because the temple was destroyed, we seven leaders initiated the reconstruction in the 19th year. The Juehui has not lived in the temple. The bailiff Li Baosheng admitted to stamping the seal, and the statements of Li Boyin, Lu Xi, and Pu Shaoting were similar. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation.

### Robbery on Hanzhong Road

At about 7:00 PM the night before last, the home of Tan Jinsheng (a local), who works at the Caojiadu Cleaning Station at No. 8 Hanzhongli, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, was suddenly visited by seven bandits dressed in miscellaneous long and short clothes with Jiangbei accents. Three of the bandits each held a pistol, threatening them not to make a sound, rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and robbed more than 80 yuan in legal tender, a gold watch, a gold chain, a Mackintosh coat, a gray squirrel fur coat, and other clothing and accessories, worth about several hundred yuan. Afterwards, the victim opened a lost list and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station under its jurisdiction, requesting the arrest of the stolen goods and the robbers.

### Yu Cailang's Abduction of a Maid to be Interrogated

Yu Cailang, from Changshu, runs an introduction shop at No. 148 North Zhejiang Road. He has a concubine named Mao Qiaoxian from Wuxi. She used to work at the home of Jiang Wu, a woman from Nanjing at No. 15, Lane 548, Bazilu, but quit due to some reason. On January 28th, Yu Cailang instigated Mao Qiaoxian to go to Jiang's house on the pretext of taking a lost scarf and took the opportunity to lure her 14-year-old maid Yao Jinfeng out and send her to the Shi family, a relative of Qiaoxian, in Xinzhen, Chongming Second District, in an attempt to sell her for profit. The case was discovered by Hua Detective Wang Runhe from the Hongkou Patrol House, who arrested Yu Cailang and Mao Qiaoxian one after another and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yao Jinfeng did not want to return to her hometown with her father Yao Peijin and her employer Jiang Wu, and was willing to study at the Jiliang Institute. The court ordered the Jiliang Institute to submit a charter. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, said that a female staff member of the Institute was present in court, and then submitted a summary. After inspecting it, the court found that it was not a detailed summary. Lawyer Zhang said that the standard of the Institute was the Western version, so he did not bring the case. He questioned the two defendants, who continued to shirk responsibility. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded to custody to await sentencing. The part about Yao was ordered to be submitted to the court for verification by the Jiliang Institute with the Western version.

### Yang Yunshi's Sons Sue for Division of Maternal Grandfather's Estate

Yunshi's wife was the eldest daughter of Li Jingfang. The result of the trial was that Yang's sons and others won the lawsuit.

Yang Yunshi, also known as Qi, a secretary-general to Wu Peifu formerly, and a native of Changshu, married Guo Yao, the eldest daughter of Li Jingfang (Zi Boxing), a former Qing Dynasty notable. They had five children: Yang Cheng, Yang Yin, Yang Quan'yin, Yang Chong'yin, and Yang Man'yin. Yang Li Guo Xiang died early, and Li Jingfang also passed away in Dalian in the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), leaving behind an estate.

Approximately eight million [yuan] was divided by Li's sons Guo Tao, Guo Xiao, Guo Hua, Guo Yun, Li's grandson Jia Ji, Li's sons-in-law Pan Yaodong, Wu Longhe, and others. Yang Cheng and others believed that their mother also had the right to inherit but were completely deprived. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit against Guo Tao and others for division of property, demanding one-eighth of the entire estate of Duke Boxing. This case has been tried repeatedly by the First Special Court and has now concluded. The judgment was announced yesterday: the defendants Li Guo Tao, Guo Xiao, Guo Hua, Guo Yun, Li Jia Ji, should

The remaining claims of the plaintiffs are dismissed. The litigation costs, except for the dismissed portion which shall be borne equally by the plaintiffs, shall be borne equally by the defendants.

It was decided to name it "Shanghai Merchants Hankou Tour Group," and Wang Xiaolai and Mao Heyuan were elected as the president and vice president of the group, respectively. It was scheduled to depart in early March on the Sanbei Company's new ship "Longxing." The crowd believed that the ship, which only took 48 hours for the entire Shanghai-Hankou journey, was a special express ship unprecedented and its internal facilities were extremely luxurious. Therefore, many people applied to join on the spot. The ship's owner, Yu Qiaqing, also joined as a member and promised to provide the group with various conveniences.

### New Chevrolet Exhibition Today

The 1937 New Chevrolet automobiles are divided into two major lines: the Leader and the Deluxe. Apart from minor differences in the front and rear axles and accessory decorations, the chassis, engine, and body design are the same. The new cars are not only beautifully and magnificently styled, but their interior is spacious and comfortable, and their mechanical aspects are strong, superior, and refined, surpassing all previous products. The new cars are now displayed by the local dealer, Li Han Motor Company, in the company's sample room at No. 100, Avenue Joffre, and are scheduled to be officially exhibited for three days starting today. It is expected that people in the automobile industry will not hesitate to rush to visit this novel and complete new car.

### The Result of Self-Degradation

Bao Zhangshi (65 years old), an old woman from Danyang in the back grass shed of Tiantongli, Zhabei, had a son, Bao Xiangwei, 26 years old, who had received secondary education. He used to be an employee of a commercial firm but was prone to extravagance and wasteful spending. He embezzled several thousand yuan in account funds. The owner of the firm discovered his fraudulent behavior and dismissed him, pursuing the guarantor for the account funds. Bao's son became unemployed and lived off his savings. He became addicted to bad habits, willingly engaged in debauchery, and was avoided by relatives and friends. His life was extremely poor. In the spring of last year, it was heard that he had become a beggar, begging on the streets during the day to fill his stomach, and sleeping under the overpass of Cun Deli on Limin Road at night, suffering from cold and hunger and falling ill. His mother, Bao Zhangshi, ignored him. He eventually died of his illness late the night before last. In the morning, someone discovered it and reported it to the police station. The police were ordered to report to the local court. Yesterday afternoon at about 4:00 PM, the prosecutor was dispatched to the scene to examine the body. Because the deceased's mother, Bao Zhangshi, could not afford a coffin, the charity provided a coffin for burial.

Special Item

### Unity and Peace – Part One

— Pan Gongzhan

㊀

The topic of "Unity and Peace" is like a scale, with "Unity" on one side and "Peace" on the other. The word "and" in the middle is the lever of the scale, weighing the weight on both sides. What exactly is the relationship between "Unity" and "Peace"? We often hear "Peaceful Unity" and also often hear "United Peace." Both of these phrases make sense, so it can be said that "Unity" and "Peace" are of equal quality, like the fish and bear's paw that Mencius compared. If following the order in the title, we should first talk about "Unity" and then about "Peace," but because the most common and urgent need of the nation and the people right now is peace, we will talk about peace first.

Why is peace the most common and urgent need of the nation and the people right now? It can be explained in two points:

First, in terms of human nature and the national character of the Chinese people, we do indeed love peace. What is human nature? It is life, not death. Just look at the character for "nature" (性), which is composed of "heart" (心) and "life" (生). This shows that "nature" is the heart that loves to survive. "Loving life and hating death is human nature," no one can deny that. There is also an old saying: "The greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life." Heaven and earth give birth to all things, and humans are the most intelligent of all things, so of course, we should follow the greatest virtue of heaven and earth and seek to live. How can we live? I can say that we must have peace in order to live. For example, in spring, the wind is gentle and the sun is warm, and plants sprout and grow. Therefore, it is said that spring has vitality and vigor. In autumn, as soon as the autumn wind rises, the leaves of the wutong tree fall and the plants wither. Therefore, it is said that autumn has a chilling atmosphere. Plants still need gentle wind and warm sun to grow, so how can humans not hope for peace? Furthermore, in terms of the national character of the Chinese people, the Chinese are particularly fond of peace. According to China's history of several thousand years, there has never been an instance of wanting to destroy other people's countries, exterminate other people's races, or prevent people of other countries from surviving like us, unlike modern imperialism in general. Think about it, many countries have interacted with China for thousands of years, and they have never been destroyed. However, now that they interact with imperialism, their countries have already been destroyed in less than a few decades. There are many examples of this, so there is no need to list them. Just look at Korea and Annam to understand. This is enough to show that the Chinese nation has always been generous, hoping to coexist and prosper with other countries, and completely embraces the idea of a peaceful and righteous path. In ancient books, there are many teachings such as "continue the extinguished lineage, revive the destroyed country, govern chaos and maintain danger, pay tribute on time, and give generously and receive sparingly." The so-called "continue the extinguished lineage" means that we must think of ways to continue the lineages that have already been extinguished. The so-called "revive the destroyed country" means that we must revive the countries that have already been destroyed. The so-called "give generously and receive sparingly" means that we in China, regarding neighboring countries, even though they send little, we should bestow more. This spirit is completely different from the methods of imperialism. The attitude of imperialism is to squeeze and exploit, causing weak nations to be destroyed and their races exterminated, of course, including their cultures perishing together. The Chinese national character, however, cherishes the righteous path of winning people over with virtue and rejects the hegemonic path of force. Therefore, from the perspective of the national character of China, it is indeed the most fond of peace.

Second, from our experiences since the Xinhai Revolution and the current environment, we feel the need for peace even more. Since the Xinhai Revolution, due to the evils of the remnants of the imperial system and the division of military warlord territories, the whole country has suffered from continuous warfare for years. The people are in deep water and scorching fire, and their spirits and materials have suffered greatly from the pain of war. Who does not hope for peace and not long to transform war into peace? People share the same heart, and hearts share the same reason. They have gained enlightenment from painful experiences, believing that only peace can bring stability and prosperity, and only peace can strengthen the country and revive the nation. The painful experiences of the past have already made everyone aware of this, which is the hope for peace. Furthermore, from the perspective of the current international environment, everyone is clamoring for collective security, hoping to jointly maintain world peace. We, as a weak country, find ourselves besieged by the forces of various imperialisms, of course, even more eager to strive to create a modern nation in an environment of international peace. Without peace, of course, there is no talk of construction, and even less talk of increasing national strength, let alone resisting external oppression? Therefore, "peace" is indeed the most common and urgent need of our nation and people right now.

Moreover, many dangerous things in the past year have been able to turn misfortune into good fortune and danger into safety. What is the reason for this? It is because the people of the whole country have unconsciously launched a great power. Because of this great power, it can influence everything. Where does this great power come from? It comes from the great spirit of the whole nation's hope for peace. Now, our country has reached a period where it needs peace; our national history has also embarked on a period of beginning to revive. Therefore, any force that wants to hinder this trend cannot do so. Because everyone hopes for peace, society is filled with an atmosphere of peace and well-being. This country is of course thriving upward and turning to recovery; if society is full of an atmosphere of struggle, only knows resentment and violence, and does not know cooperation and coordination, then this country must be chaotic. Our China has gone through more than 20 years of the pain of war, and everyone hopes for peace. Therefore, there was a major turning point last year. The Liangguang Incident and the Xi'an Incident were able to turn danger into safety. Not only are things like this in terms of human affairs, but also in terms of heavenly timing. Agricultural production has had a good harvest, and the national economy is also expected to be thriving. (To be continued)

Submission

### Letter from Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, etc. to the Creditors of Tongyi (Continued)

Thirdly, regarding the issue of funds for resumption of business, some may worry that since the company has no working capital, how can it lightly talk about resuming business? This worry is indeed valid. However, from the beginning of our mediation, we have discussed this with the debtors. At that time, we had planned to add preferred shares and bank loans. The number of preferred shares was assumed to be 640,000 yuan, which, together with the previous 1,360,000 yuan, would amount to 2,000,000 yuan, which would be the total capital of the new company. Considering that the end of the year is approaching and resumption of business must be pursued urgently, while raising funds cannot be done in a hurry, we sought a transitional method. The only way was to first contact the bank to loan 640,000 yuan, so as to free up time to calmly raise funds to repay the loan. Now, we have worked hard together with the debtors to make progress, and we have achieved results. We have already obtained the consent of major banks to jointly lend 640,000 yuan in national currency, promising to sign a contract and allocate the funds immediately after the mediation is established. Therefore, anyone who is concerned about the issue of funds for resumption of business is unaware of the truth.

The advantages and disadvantages of mediation have been clearly explained, and the feasibility of the plan has been carefully considered. We are fair and just, so what else is there to say? However, some superficial observers may say that if the mediation is established, the debtors can avoid liability for compensation. Is the mediation plan only to help the directors and supervisors of Tongyi get out of trouble? We reply: Is helping the directors and supervisors out of trouble not also helping the creditors out of trouble? In the world, there are things that cause mutual harm and both sides lose, and there are things that coexist and prosper together. A single thought and action can determine good and evil, benefit and harm. The suffering of all beings in the final calamity is great. On a large scale, there are the disturbances in Europe, and on a small scale, there are the disputes between China and Japan. The matter of Tongyi is indeed small and insignificant, not worth mentioning. However, the kindness, meanness, forgiveness, and malice of people's hearts will also be tested here. Harmony brings auspiciousness, and anger invites disaster. Mutual understanding and concession are harmony, and mutual destruction and killing are anger. Harmony brings benefits invisibly, and anger brings harm immeasurably. The reason why we have stepped forward to mediate is that we cannot bear to see more than 6,000 creditors and the directors and supervisors of Tongyi holding each other back, going to extremes, and ultimately losing both sides. We have no love or hate in between. Moreover, the loss of the directors and supervisors is the loss of one person, while the loss of the creditors is the loss of more than 6,000 households. There must be someone who can distinguish the difference in size and weight. The so-called helping out of trouble should not be one-sided. If the strength of the directors and supervisors is in fact sufficient to compensate for the losses of the creditors, wouldn't it be simple and easy? Why bother with mediation? If not, then the creditors are merely sacrificing their energy, time, and the actual benefits of their claims, arguing with the powerless directors and supervisors over short and long, venting their anger. What is the point? The directors and supervisors of Tongyi have scattered like clouds. According to what we have heard and what the lawyers representing the creditors have learned, there are only five people in Shanghai. Among them, one is relatively wealthy, but he is old and sick, and he has many children and grandchildren. He has already divided his property seven or eight years ago, and he has very little of his own. The other four either have no property and have debts, or their debts and property are roughly offset. Those who linger in other places either have unknown residences or have long been known for their poverty. In short, none of them have the ability to be liable for compensation. Recently, the bankruptcy administrator petitioned the court to investigate the property of the directors and supervisors from various industries and shops, and to implement seizure. After months of effort, the property obtained is only worth tens of thousands of yuan, which is not even one or two percent of the total amount of debt. This is clear proof. What hope do the creditors have? After the suspension of business, the accounts have been liquidated by the liquidator and the bankruptcy administrator for more than ten years. None of the directors and supervisors have been found to be in arrears, which is hailed as rare by public opinion. It can be seen that the business failure is a public fault, not a private defect. Analyzing the term "directors and supervisors" in a general way, there are chairmen and general managers, executive directors, directors who do not perform business, and directors who are far away and never ask about things. Their natures are very different. Among them, the directors who do not ask about things should be responsible in name, but in reality, they are implicated. Their sacrifice of stocks, the loss and shelving of their own and their family's savings is pitiful. They are almost the same as the creditors. Although it can be said that their prior negligence is not excusable, however, they seem to have no shame in their conscience for compensating for the losses caused by their negligence with their own losses. Moreover, they do not receive salaries on weekdays, do not spend public funds, have obligations but no rights, specialize in bearing responsibilities, and suffer from lawsuits. They plan for the aftermath and help mediate without complaint, which can also be redeemed. Those who perform business and handle things poorly are indeed guilty and cannot argue. However, it is heard that the property of their entire family has been invested in Tongyi stocks, totaling no less than 300,000 yuan. Now, they are old and impoverished, their families are ruined, and their reputations are ruined. They are scolded by all parties and will not have a moment of peace. Their punishment is already heavy, and their illness is already deep. How can kind people bear to add insult to injury? Therefore, judging from the strength of the directors and supervisors, it is not enough to compensate. Judging from the emotions of the directors and supervisors, there is still something to be forgiven. For the sake of their own interests and for the sake of a benevolent heart, the creditors should recognize that mediation and resumption of business are the only path at present. The best strategy is to urge the directors and supervisors to quickly mediate and resume business on time, and to urge the directors and supervisors to take care of the interests of the creditors in every aspect and be careful in handling matters when implementing the mediation plan and handling the resumption of business procedures. It should be known that after the mediation is established, there are still many things that the directors and supervisors should be responsible for handling, such as the solicitation of preferred shares, the bank's loans, and the efforts to collect accounts and find ways to sell a portion of unnecessary assets at a good price, all of which are beneficial to the creditors, and are far better than urging the directors and supervisors to bear responsibilities that are beyond their capabilities and have no practical benefits. For the sake of the interests of both parties and for the sake of the entire finance, we have carefully considered and explained the facts and presented this letter. We hope that you will adopt it. We wish you all the best. (We apologize for not being able to sign each copy due to the large number of copies being printed.) Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Zhaobang, Chen Zhigao, together.

### A Retrospective on the Past Year's Work of the New Life Movement Third Anniversary Special Issue General Association

— Qian Dajun

"Learning from the past can guide the future." As we commemorate the second anniversary of the New Life Movement, let us, with this principle in mind, conduct a concise review of the past year's work of this Association.

The past year's work of this Association can be roughly divided into three aspects: first, routine work; second, seasonal work; and third, other important work.

1. Routine Work

The routine work involves the continued promotion of the two movements of Orderliness and Cleanliness. The Association has formulated two routine core tasks for the New Life Movement, "namely, encompassing the Cleanliness Movement and the Orderliness Movement," and has issued them to all levels of the New Life Movement for implementation. Furthermore, in the capital, we have supervised the Capital New Life Movement Association to effectively advance these efforts.

2. Seasonal Work

The seasonal work includes: (1) Spring, Planting Movement; (2) Summer, Hygiene Movement; (3) Autumn, Thrift Movement; (4) Winter, Relief Movement.

(1) The Spring Planting Movement is of utmost importance and significance. However, due to the Association's relocation from Gan to Nanjing and internal reorganization, it could not be implemented.

(2) The Summer Hygiene Movement aims to encourage citizens to pay attention to hygiene, reduce diseases, and promote health. For the entire country, the Association pre-determined a work outline of twenty-six items. A notice was issued to New Life Movement Associations in various regions, stating that the period from May 20th to August 20th would be the duration for conducting the Summer Hygiene Movement. For each task, the steps were divided and carried out on schedule. After the notice was issued, New Life Movement Associations in various provinces, cities, and railways successively reported the establishment of Summer Hygiene Movement Committees, and submitted various regulations and implementation methods to the Association. These were all carefully reviewed, and any inconsistencies were corrected. The twenty-six items of the work outline are listed below to clarify the content: (1) Hold Summer Hygiene Movement Propaganda Week; (2) Distribute leaflets, paste slogans, and broadcast hygiene lectures; (3) Conduct a thorough cleaning; (4) Use movie theaters and slides for publicity; (5) Hold hygiene exhibitions; (6) Conduct epidemic prevention injections; (7) Disinfect public toilets; (8) Clear ponds and ditches; (9) Conduct door-to-door guidance on eliminating flies and mosquitoes; (10) Disinfect well water; (11) Promote the use of tap water; (12) Prohibit spitting; (13) Prohibit public urination and defecation; (14) Conduct hygiene guidance for hotels and apartments; (15) Conduct hygiene guidance for teahouses and restaurants; (16) Conduct hygiene guidance for entertainment venues; (17) Conduct hygiene guidance for bathhouses; (18) Conduct hygiene guidance for vegetable markets; (19) Conduct hygiene guidance for street vendors; (20) Conduct hygiene guidance for cold food shops; (21) Conduct hygiene guidance for meat shops; (22) Conduct hygiene guidance for tofu shops; (23) Conduct hygiene guidance for rickshaw pullers; (24) Conduct hygiene guidance for train stations; (25) Conduct hygiene guidance for docks.

For the capital, the Association dispatched personnel to join with various sectors of the capital to organize the Capital Summer Hygiene Movement Committee to carry out a large-scale hygiene movement. To meet the actual needs of summer hygiene in the capital, the following matters were undertaken: (1) Implement hygiene training for promoters and workers in various industries; (2) Hold a Hygiene Movement Propaganda Week; (3) Inspect and advise institutions, schools, entertainment venues, and others; (4) Advise general households and shops to implement hygiene regulations; (5) Carry out anti-epidemic, fly and mosquito extermination campaigns; (6) Promote labor service, implement cleaning and sweeping; (7) Promote drinking tap water, requesting the tap water management office to reduce water prices and installation fees; (8) Ban violations of hygiene regulations; (9) Issue hygiene manuals to guide citizens; (10) Organize hygiene exhibitions.

From the above, it can be seen that the national Summer Hygiene Movement launched by the Association last year was planned in considerable detail, and its implementation was quite diligent. Although the positive and beneficial effects are difficult to estimate, it seems that it has had a considerable effect on the negative side. The reduction of diseases nationwide last summer is one proof of this. We should continue our efforts in the future.

(3) The Autumn Thrift Movement, with the spirit of simplicity, thrift, speed, and certainty, vigorously promotes thrift in order to enrich human, financial, and material resources, and to enable the people to enjoy their work, thereby contributing to national economic construction. As the Thrift Movement was also one of the work outlines of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee General Association last year, this Association consulted with the Committee to jointly work together. On August 1st, a joint office was established, and this Association drafted the "Implementation Measures for the Thrift Movement." After the office held a meeting to review and approve the measures, they were announced to the branches of the National Economic Construction Committee, as well as the New Life Movement Promotion Associations in various provinces, cities, railways, and overseas Chinese communities, with a deadline of September 21st for compliance and implementation, and periodic inspections were conducted.

The scope of work for the Thrift Movement is divided into the following four categories:

A. Time-Saving Movement, with three items: (1) Promote early rising and early sleeping; (2) Strictly adhere to working and meeting times; discourage gambling-like entertainment.

B. Thrifty Spending Movement, with four items: (1) Expenses should be frugal; (2) Gifts and rewards should not be extravagant; (3) Banquets should be simple; (4) Promote savings and insurance.

C. Love-of-Things Movement, with three items: (1) Promote domestic goods; (2) Cherish public property; (3) Utilize waste materials.

D. Enjoy-Your-Work Movement, with four items: (1) Increase people's interest in their occupation; enabling those with jobs to enjoy their work, and enabling the unemployed to start businesses. (2) Join labor service groups during leisure time to engage in road construction, afforestation, dike repair, and other public works. (3) Promote rural side businesses to benefit farmers. Increase wealth. (4) Use saved money, alone or in conjunction with relatives and friends, to engage in productive businesses.

As a result of last year's Thrift Movement, the extravagant and decadent social atmosphere has been reversed to a considerable extent. However, to achieve significant results, New Life Movement colleagues, civil servants, and leaders from all walks of life throughout the country must earnestly promote it in the future.

(4) The Winter Relief Movement started with investigations because the existing relief organizations or groups in various regions were not fully understood. In addition to preparing and issuing survey forms to New Life Movement Associations in various regions with a deadline for completion, the Association also dispatched personnel to conduct investigations at various relief societies in the capital, in order to understand the organization, work, funding, fundraising, and relief methods of these societies, as a reference for formulating a relief movement plan.

3. Other Important Work

Other important work can be roughly divided into the following eleven types: (1) Dispatch inspection teams; (2) Promote the New Life Movement on ships; (3) Pilot summer rural service for university students; (4) Guide national jamborees and reviews of Girl Scouts to perform rural service; (5) Ban extra gratuity movement; (6) Rectify the New Life Movement in Shanghai; (7) Organize the New Life Movement in Guangdong; (8) Promote the National Women's New Life Movement; (9) Organize the Sunset Society; (10) Implement New Life Movement training for workers in various industries nationwide; (11) Organize battlefield service corps.

(1) Dispatch of Inspection Teams. In order to promote the New Life Movement in various regions and intensify work, the Association, following the instructions of the president, trained the fourth class of students in the Political Training Class of the Military Affairs Commission. After graduation, a draft inspection plan was prepared and submitted to the president for approval. One hundred and twenty-eight students were transferred to form the New Life Movement Inspection Team, which was formally established on March 1st. Its tasks were defined as: (1) To examine and assist the general New Life Movement work in various provinces and cities, paying particular attention to the promotion of the Cleanliness and Orderliness Movements; (2) To examine the performance of civil servants and New Life Movement promotion cadres in promoting the New Life Movement, paying particular attention to military police; (3) To guide and inspect the organization and work of New Life Movement Associations and labor service groups in various regions; (4) To investigate the organization and training of the masses in various regions; (5) To investigate the state of social education in various regions, and actively provide guidance and promotion. In addition to the above items, when necessary, actively participate in the work with various party, government, and military organs. The inspection route. From the capital and along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, to Shanghai. Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, to Hangzhou. Via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and coastal counties, to southern and northern Anhui, into Henan, along the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, and then back to Beijing. The journey lasted six months. After the inspection of each location was completed, a report was prepared and sent to the Association for verification.

(2) Promotion of the New Life Movement on Ships. This can be explained in two points: (1) Assist the Ministry of Communications in implementing the ship management measures. Since April 1st of last year, the following items have been implemented: A. Abolish the compradore system and replace it with an administrative director. B. Sell berths separately from ship tickets. C. Pay stewards a monthly salary, starting from 16 yuan minimum. D. Stipulate that gratuities are one-tenth of the ticket price and cannot be demanded additionally. E. Formulate measures to ban fare evasion on ships. F. Formulate measures for rewarding and punishing China Merchants Bureau workers. (2) Organize New Life Movement training classes for stewards from the China Merchants Bureau and other private shipping companies. Stewards from various ships are rotated for training, with each class lasting two months, teaching New Life Movement essentials, service knowledge, military training, party principles, and hygiene.

Since the promotion of the New Life Movement on ships, the bad habits and malpractices in the management and personnel aspects of Chinese ships have been largely eliminated, making it convenient for merchants and travelers.

(3) Piloting Summer Rural Service for University Students. In order to enable university students to use their summer vacation opportunities to serve rural areas, improve the lives of farmers, and awaken farmers' awareness of the country, a pilot New Life Movement Summer Rural Service Corps was organized. The schools and work areas were limited to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The Association formulated a simple charter and compiled a summer rural service manual, which was distributed to all members to provide a basis for service. Certificates were also issued to each member for identification. At the same time, the Association notified local governments and New Life Movement Associations to provide assistance to facilitate the process. A total of more than 300 students from one school, the Central Political School, joined the work of this group; individuals who voluntarily joined included 66 students from thirteen schools, including Nanjing Central University, Ginling College, Soochow University, Hangzhou Zhejiang University, Shanghai University, and Jinan University. According to the work reports of the members, the work encountered various difficulties and obstacles, but due to the sincere service of the members, the farmers who had received guidance all had a good impression and critique of the group. In the future, based on last year's experience, efforts will be made to promote summer rural service nationwide.

(4) Guiding National Jamborees and Reviews of Girl Scouts to Perform Rural Service. During the Second National Jamboree and Review of Boy Scouts of China last October, the Boy Scouts Association invited this Association to cooperate in designating rural service for Girl Scouts. It was agreed that the service locations would be nine villages near the mausoleum, and the service items would be to guide the cleanliness and hygiene of farmhouses and rural teahouses, barbershops, restaurants, and other venues. The service time was from 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM on October 8th, and the necessary supplies were prepared in advance. Each village was assigned a squad of Girl Scouts, led by a staff member from the office, and police officers were dispatched by the police department to take care of them at all times. The Association dispatched personnel to provide guidance, supervision, and evaluation. As a result, it was found that Girl Scouts generally lacked experience in social service, and it seems necessary to pay special attention to training in the future.

(5) Ban Extra Gratuity Movement. It has been found that waiters in public places in various regions often solicit extra gratuities from guests. This bad habit can not only foster extravagance but also easily cultivate class consciousness among the people, which is contrary to the tenets of the New Life Movement. In order to implement thrift and enhance the character and self-esteem of waiters, it is necessary to thoroughly reform this. Therefore, in July of last year, the Association formulated measures to ban the extra gratuity movement. In general, in addition to the regular bill plus one, waiters should not solicit extra tips from guests. If waiters solicit tips, guests should refuse. If guests give tips, waiters should refuse. A notice was issued to New Life Movement Associations for thorough implementation. According to reports from various regions, compliance has been effective to a considerable extent. The Association also paid attention to guidance and thorough promotion in the capital.

(6) Rectification of the New Life Movement in Shanghai. Based on the report of the inspection team that the New Life Movement work in Shanghai was not practical and needed rectification, the Association specially formulated "Methods to Improve the Promotion of the New Life Movement in Shanghai." The main contents are divided into: (1) Raising personnel and funds; (2) Promoting from civil servants; (3) Promoting the New Life Movement in schools; (4) Training police to promote the New Life Movement. Personnel were dispatched to discuss and rectify the situation with the Shanghai Association.

(7) Organizing the New Life Movement in Guangdong. During the Two Guangxi Incident last year, Guangdong was the first to resolve it peacefully. When the Association sent personnel to promote the New Life Movement in Guangdong in August, the president was still in Guangdong. The working steps were determined in accordance with the president's instructions: (1) Preparation; (2) Organizing the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal New Life Movement Associations; (3) Training New Life Movement cadres and military police; (4) Promotion, from various institutions and social organizations, public places, from heads of various institutions and general civil servants to the general public. In addition, in order to deepen the meaning of the New Life Movement in the hearts of the people, a New Life Movement Propaganda Week was held from September 10th, using various methods to expand publicity. As for the organization of the Women's Work Committee, the rectification of the city's appearance, the printing of slogans, and other plans, either participating in guidance or being responsible for design, all efforts were made.

(8) Promoting the National Women's New Life Movement. In the past year, women throughout the country have vigorously implemented the New Life Movement under the guidance of the Association's Women's Guidance Department. There are ten places where Women's Work Committees, Women's New Life Movement Associations, or Women's Life Improvement Associations have been established, including the capital, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Qinghai, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Xikou, Zhejiang. There are a total of thirty-nine New Life Movement Labor Service Groups for women that have been established nationwide, with more than six thousand six hundred members, of which schools account for sixteen groups, with more than two thousand one hundred and ninety-seven members. In the future, it is planned to adjust the established women's New Life Movement organizations and engage in organization in places where Women's New Life Movement Work Committees have not been established. Efforts will also be made to increase the number of Women's Labor Service Groups in various regions.

(9) Organizing the Sunset Society. In order to train the public, enhance group entertainment, and improve group life, the Association, after a work meeting resolution, decided that the Colleagues' Extracurricular Life Improvement Association would be responsible for organizing the Sunset Society. The meeting place was on the grass in the northeastern corner of the First Park in Beijing, and the meeting time was set for 7:00 PM every Thursday. From July 16th to September 24th, except for one interruption on July 30th, a total of ten consecutive meetings were held. Each meeting included a New Life Movement lecture and entertainment. Starting from the fifth meeting, teaching items were added, such as singing party songs at the fifth meeting, "Salute when raising and lowering the national flag" at the sixth meeting, "Be polite to others" at the seventh meeting, "How to be polite to women and children" at the eighth meeting, "How to cherish public property and pay attention to public morals" at the ninth meeting, etc., which were particularly meaningful. The number of people attending increased from more than a thousand at the first meeting to about six thousand at the last meeting.

(10) Implementing New Life Movement Training for Workers in Various Industries Nationwide. The workers in various industries referred to here are temporarily limited to those serving in (1) restaurants, (2) teahouses, (3) hotels, (4) bathhouses, (5) barbershops, (6) entertainment venues, and other places. In order to awaken their national consciousness, encourage them to practice the New Life Movement, cultivate their service spirit, and improve their business skills, the Association formulated a general outline of the New Life Movement training plan for various types of workers, and in August of last year, notified New Life Movement Associations in various regions to implement it. The content of the outline is divided into: A. Principles, B. Scope, C. Materials, D. Methods and Steps, E. Time, F. Funding, etc. The Association also dispatched personnel to inspect and guide the training of workers in various industries in the capital.

(11) Organizing Battlefield Service Corps. The bandit invasion of Suiyuan aroused national indignation. The government was determined to suppress the bandits, and the soldiers at the front were also able to bravely sacrifice themselves for the country. In order to promote the spirit of serving the country, encourage the people's patriotism, and express assistance and encouragement to the soldiers at the front, the Association specially organized a battlefield service corps to go to the Suiyuan area to serve the soldiers and civilians on the battlefield. Recruitment of members began on December 7th of last year, and by the 10th, more than 120 young people from all walks of life had signed up. After the examination, twenty people were selected and formally organized. Training was implemented from the 15th, including military training, spiritual lectures, New Life Movement essentials, and first aid, and lectures by famous people were held. The planned work after departure was divided into three major categories: (1) Relief, (2) Comfort, (3) Communication. The original plan was to depart around the 20th, but due to the president's misfortune in Xi'an, the plan was temporarily changed. It was decided to first go to Shaanxi to deal with the crisis, and then go to Suiyuan. Many staff members of the Association also signed up to participate. Subsequently, as the president escaped danger and returned to Beijing, the corps changed its plan again and decided to depart for Suiyuan for service in January of this year.

The Association's work over the past year is roughly as described above. Some tasks need to be continued in the future, such as the Cleanliness Movement, Orderliness Movement, Planting Movement, Hygiene Movement, Thrift Movement, Relief Movement, and promoting the National Women's New Life Movement. Some tasks need to be continued in the future, such as dispatching inspection teams and organizing the Sunset Society. Some tasks need to be actively promoted in the future, such as promoting the New Life Movement on ships, student summer rural service, and implementing New Life Movement training for workers. Upon careful review, each task has its own considerable significance and value. However, the New Life Movement is a movement for the national life revolution and a movement for the revitalization of the nation. This movement cannot be completed in a short period of time, nor can it be accomplished by a small number of people. In the future, the colleagues of this Association must continue to test and create in the spirit of experimentation and creation, focusing on the big picture and starting with the small details, so that the work of the New Life Movement can have continuous progress. At the same time, we hope that comrades and leaders from all walks of life throughout the country will continue to work hard and actively carry out the work. In particular, we hope that compatriots across the country will be aware that the past way of life is not in line with the times and the environment, which is enough to cause internal troubles and attract external insults, and that it is necessary to carry out a life revolution and practice it personally. As we celebrate the third anniversary of the New Life Movement and begin the fourth year of work, the colleagues of this Association are willing to work together with comrades from all walks of life and compatriots across the country to plan and work together!

Shen Bao Literary Supplement

### The Beauty of the Rough

— Quan Lin

The beauty of the rough, such a term, may cause your misunderstanding, thinking that we are here to promote a dirty, untidy, chaotic life—which is obviously "uncivilized." Here we need to explain that this is not our ultimate goal; what we ultimately seek is the equal beauty of the human spirit and matter, the true beauty of mankind. When such an era arrives, we will see such a beautiful life: humans are free and lively, strong and prosperous, orderly and disciplined, working together for the benefit of the masses, as cheerful and passionate as the sun. But such an era is still very far away—although we can be sure that it will come. At present, in order to strive to pursue such a goal, we must first strip away the false, morbid, and beauty-decorated-by-others'-blood-and-sweat concepts of the old era. When you do this, you will see the resistant faces of the laborers under modern social life, their physical tension, and from the filth, roughness, impoliteness, and intense life, you will see the true soul of humanity, and the truly lovable places of humanity—composed of all these elements, that is the entirety of the beauty of the rough.

In other words, would you (assuming you are also one of the masses) not find the loud, tragic labor chorus emanating from the throats of a group of sweaty, muscle-bulging boatmen, or the pure, unchallengeable grimace floating on a dirty, sun-scorched face, more charming and lovable than the elegant demeanor of gentlemen with powdered faces, or the sweet smiles of ladies nourished by rouge and perfume?

To cite such an example from literature, it is best to contrast the characters of Charles Dickens with the characters of Maxim Gorky. Dickens is undoubtedly one of the most successful people in describing characters in the seventeenth century, and his skills are worth learning. But the characters in each of his novels almost have a certain format, that is, all the characters that the author considers to be good are gentle, kind, dignified, and docile like pigeons, while those recognized by the author as villains are mostly ugly, dirty, rude, cursing all day long, and not believing in God. He wrote this ugliness and beauty to a very extreme degree, even good people in difficult circumstances do not lose their pigeon-like docility, while villains in superior environments reveal their rough weaknesses everywhere. When you read such works, you will deeply imprint the author's concept of beauty, and unintentionally divide humans into a graceful, civilized part—God's chosen people, and an ugly, vulgar, ordinary part, and objectively foster the consciousness that the top-hat class should rule the majority of the people. But when you read Gorky's novels, you will instead be surprised by the protagonists in his books, almost all of whom are a ragged, rough group—smugglers, fugitives, boatmen, hungry farmers, thieves, and traitors to God. Gorky added everything that Dickens used to describe the villains in his books to his protagonists, such as straw-like messy hair, brown short and stiff mustaches, red and festering eyes, and wrinkled skin, which can be seen almost everywhere. When you first come into contact with these masters, you may feel disgusting and ridiculous, but as you gradually become familiar with them, you will suddenly feel that they are cute, and when you finish reading them, you will feel that your soul has merged with these rough people, and even their every frown and smile is charming and beautiful to you at this time; and this kind of beauty cannot be obtained from gentlemen. Indeed, Gorky used his great pen to show us the beauty in the human soul, and to make us see the lovable places of humanity from the rough.

This concept of beauty had already germinated when naturalism began. When Milan rejected the government's request to paint "Hagar and Ishmael in the Desert" and ran back to the village of Barbizon, he openly made a fierce protest against the old concept of beauty. Although he was scolded as a "painter of ugliness" at that time, we can also find this kind of example in our Chinese old novels, such as Water Margin, in which the author wrote Li Kui and Lu Zhishen as the most outstanding characters, and their characteristics lie in their possession of this rough beauty, so that the 17th century Chinese critic Jin Shengtan could not help but call these two rough characters charming and lovable.

Originally, there is no absolute beauty in the world (the so-called pure beauty), because art is a kind of social ideology. But artists should be aware of the tasks of their own historical era, and observe social life from a correct position, and show the beauty of the era from there.

### Mountain Country Love Sketches

— Han Gu

—Special Feature on Border Customs—

Yulong is a remote and isolated small county in the southwestern border province.

The Jinsha River ripples with graceful waves, flowing down from the upper reaches. On both sides of the river are steep and rugged mountains, with scattered homes distributed on the mountainsides.

The seasons in the mountain country possess a wild quality. Lush forests form a row of jade screens, and wildflowers, like playful children, laugh and dance. Green moss covers the entire mountain, as if inlaid with emeralds. Flocks of sheep wander on the slopes. The sunlight gradually disappears on the shepherd's whip, signaling the approach of dusk. The mountain forests are dyed crimson, and golden waves ripple on the Jinsha River. A few white clouds in the sky resemble piles of tattered old carpets. The sun passes over the earthen walls of the mountain village, and the horizon is a fiery red. The sun is like a lead ball dragged out of a furnace, about to roll down. Shepherds shout "Hush! Hush!" driving the sheep down the mountain. Cowherds! "Wu-qu, wu-qu!" Lead the cattle down the slope. Passersby yell "A-hu-hu-wei-xing-de!—de!" to urge on their horses. The carters shout "Di-li! Purple mule!" and throw a stone at the mule's hindquarters.

The girls of Yulong, treading on the setting sun, cut grass on the mountainside, wearing blue cloth clothes, draped with sheepskins, and tied with aprons. The aprons are folded in half and tucked at the waist, trailing braids, or with braids wrapped around their heads. Some wear white mourning headbands, others wear hats with large red tassels, and all are barefoot.

The men wear head coverings, white undershirts, and woven woolen vests over the undershirts. Their wide-legged trousers are rolled up, and some wear hemp sandals, others wear thread sandals, with a red tassel on the sandal tops. They lead a horse, or walk empty-handed, towards the mountainside. When they see a girl, if she is someone they admire (because they see each other often), they stretch their voices and sing:

"I say, little sister! Your brother wants to be your brother and sister, don't joke around, I'm telling you, it's a pity we're familiar with each other but not well acquainted."

Hearing this, the girl straightens up, looks at the other party, and if she is unwilling, she continues singing:

"I say, you also have brothers and sisters at home, don't joke around, I'm telling you, why bother looking for someone else outside?"

Hearing this, the man gets angry and continues singing:

"I say, little sister! It's strange to see a crooked tree, don't joke around, I'm telling you, I'd chop down two trees more beautiful than you!"

Hearing this, the girl also gets angry and continues singing:

"I say, it's hard to find a straight tree in the mountains, don't joke around, I'm telling you, no one in the world lives to be a hundred years old."

Hearing this, the man refuses to give up and starts cursing:

"I say, a duck is not the companion of a goose, don't joke around, I'm telling you, little sister, how can you match your brother's heart?"

Hearing this, the girl also refuses to give up and continues singing:

"I say, a small rooster is just learning to crow, don't joke around, I'm telling you, a sow climbs over the wall and puts out the fire."

Hearing this, the man curses even more harshly!

"......"

Hearing this, the woman also refuses to give up, and sometimes the two sides will end up fighting.

After the girl hears the man's first song, if she is willing, she will reply in a delicate and gentle tone:

"I say, everyone under the heavens is brothers and sisters, don't joke around, I'm telling you, I'm not afraid of being familiar by face, not well acquainted."

Hearing this, the man feels indescribably happy and relaxed, and continues singing:

"I say, little sister! Bees travel far to gather nectar, don't joke around, I'm telling you, don't look at the feet, look at the journey."

Hearing this, the girl continues singing:

"I say, the dove pecks at the feet, don't joke around, I'm telling you, step by step, come closer."

So the two people sing and walk together. The two sit on the mountainside, admiring the sunset glow in the sky, watching the birds covered in pale red gauze flying in the sky. The mountain sends the sounds of the yellow chestnuts, mixed with the sound of the Jinsha River, flowing eastward. The willows on the shore sway in the evening breeze, casting their shadows in the water, like cradles swinging. The two sit together, facing the booklet, humming mountain songs, until dusk, when the cold wind fades the setting sun. The brilliant sunset glow disappears on the distant river, the distant mountains gradually darken and become hazy, the river surface is covered with a thin mist, and the trees on the mountain sway with a black, shiny light in the blurry twilight. The two agree on the next appointment, and then reluctantly part.

### Romantic Talk (Woodcut)

— M. Pikov

### Before the Tomb

— Long Gonggong

Like a small hill, a pile of purposes about to wither, red flowers placed before me. I calmly breathe in the fragrance of the earth, carrying traces of all unforgettable memories. Afterwards, I lay down beside it, closed my eyes, and the sun gradually moved away from my eyelids.

I purely and silently sleep in the darkness. No wind, no flowers, no myself.

The huge sound from the heart of the earth roared. Underground springs flowed below, like millions of madmen rushing towards a small spark. I accepted the sensation and sang a silent song of rest. In my heart, I sang each simple phrase, "May you—rest—in peace—" repeatedly, endlessly, slowly, heavily, never able to finish.

"Rest—in—the earth..."

My lips were stiff, and tears were like a pair of iron tongs, coldly clamping my temples and aching back of my head. I was not singing, but each phrase in the song was lifting its heel and stomping heavily on my heart.

"Hey, get up, what are you doing here!"

The sweeper (the one who asked me for the snowball flowers when I walked in, saying he would use a tin can to display them for me, but I refused) came again and woke me up. He kicked my head and pressed down on my outstretched arm a few times. He placed two buckets of clean water that he had fetched from the distant water pipe by the side of the road.

When I used my palm to scoop some water from his bucket to sprinkle on the iris flowers, he disagreed and said, "It's useless, water—how can it work? The sun will soften them as soon as it shines and the wind blows."

But I was determined to dig a deep hole in front of the grave to plant my flowers in it. I dug with my fingers, dry branches, and tiles. The soil was wet and firm, making it difficult to dig a cylindrical shape, enough to plant my flowers securely in the hole.

"You can't dig a hole here!" The sweeper interfered again.

"Why can't I? Isn't the ground for planting flowers?"

"I won't allow it!" This time he spat out his words severely.

"I insist on digging!"

Having no other choice, he picked up his water buckets and walked away. I heard him say this ridiculous lie while humming:

"Dig, if you dig a hole in the ground—it will rain, and water will leak into the grave... I'm doing it for the best!"

With no one and no birds around, I offered one last solemn salute to that great existence—the eternal existence.

### Old Duan

— Ai

He looks very young, only about seventeen or eighteen years old, but we got to know each other very well. I still liked to add the character "old" to his surname, as the people of Xining generally did, and call him Old Duan. He cooked and managed the warehouse for others, but when he was free to go out, he liked to wear a full Western suit, or just a white shirt, paired with Western trousers and leather shoes. The first time we met, I couldn't guess what he did at all. I just shook his hand and felt that his palm was very rough, especially between his thumb and middle finger, there were thick calluses. Before I met some sailor friends, (sailors really like to wear Western suits) I was very surprised to see a worker who liked to dress so nicely, and I was also slightly dissatisfied. This wasn't to say that he didn't fit the part and shouldn't wear it, but I thought, why learn these unnecessary luxuries? When he said one day that he had read my articles in the newspaper, and took out a dog-eared book from his arms, pointing with his clumsy fingers, asking me to explain some new terms to him, I completely tore down this veil of dissatisfaction. This is what happens when people have an inner connection, and if they understand each other better, they will naturally forget about appearances.

He had never formally studied. At first, he wanted to recognize a few characters. He lived with a typesetter who was a fellow villager, and saw that people of the same age as him were able to read books and newspapers, and talk about many things that he didn't understand to the adults. Afterwards, he had an even stronger desire to study after meeting a young man who was stranded in Yangon and unable to develop, and only taught in a private school. Due to this person's daily guidance, his childish mind also warmed up to the hope for the future of mankind. Previously, in the kitchen, he had been confused and mixed with oil smoke and coal ash, wasting the best time of his life. He didn't care, but now, he took out the book from his arms while the rice pot wasn't cooking, quietly squatted by the stove and read. Whenever he had free time, he would try to meet young friends with promise, wanting to learn something worthwhile from others. According to him, saving up his wages to make Western suits started at this time.

His boss, a gloomy middle-aged businessman, specialized in wholesale "Chinese bellflower" business. —Regarding "Chinese bellflower", I still don't know whether it's a Chinese name or a Burmese transliteration. I only know that this raw material, when made, is the red sealing wax we use on envelopes and parcel bags. —Since hiring Old Duan, he has saved another labor expense, because in addition to asking him to cook, he also had him manage the "Chinese bellflower" in the usually locked warehouse, and supervise the Indian workers who carried it. For Old Duan, this was not very difficult, because he had followed horse drivers and noodle shop masters since he was a child, and had experienced a lot of training and hardship. Moreover, he was extremely quick, and as long as the warehouse was locked, he could take the time to do things under his own name—read books, find friends. The boss was initially unhappy that he often went out, but because Old Duan had learned to be quick-witted while working as a waiter in a noodle shop, he told the boss directly that he only sold his strength and did not sell his body, that he had done everything well and had never slacked off in a single job. Why was he not allowed to go out? If he was prevented without reason, he would rather quit. The boss blushed, scratched his head, and casually said a few evasive words that would not compromise his status, and afterwards, he turned a blind eye and let him be free.

His boss was also very dissatisfied with him wearing Western suits, but he was not willing to say it directly. Once, the Indian Gandhi came to Yangon to promote the non-violent resistance movement. The boss went to see it and came back, bringing good intentions, and said to Old Duan: "Look at Gandhi, who is famous all over the world, he is still naked, only wearing a piece of cloth! Everyone on the street respects him when they see him? I believe that it's not important to be particular, about leather shoes and Western suits." Old Duan told me that he knew that the boss's words did not contain bad intentions, but because he saw that annoying teaching expression, he retorted to him, "Big shots are great" even if they don't wear a thread and their balls are showing, someone will still hold them! How can we compare to those people? We people wear Western suits, and we still get stepped on. One time, he came looking very distressed. He said: "Recently, after eating dinner, the boss straightens his clothes and goes out. The boss's wife hurriedly asked me to follow him closely and see where the boss went. As a result, the boss went to a Japanese prostitute. I think, honestly, if I tell the truth, the two of them will make a big fuss and beat each other bloody, and besides, a guy like the boss will play with one woman after another, how will he change for the better just because you have an argument out of nowhere? It's like a cat that eats fish, how can we get rid of the fishy smell? If I were to come back and tell her everything, it wouldn't do anyone any good. As for myself, I might even break my rice bowl, because if the boss becomes angry, wouldn't he blame me? I had to lie, so that everyone can be clean. At the same time, I didn't want the boss's wife to blame me for not being diligent, so I told the boss everything about the boss's wife asking me to be a detective, because the boss's words when he came back didn't match what I made up at all, and that woman's mouth wouldn't curse you until you were bleeding? You tell me, did I do the right thing? ... Sigh, no matter how you say it, I always feel like I've done something wrong, and I'm always sad, you don't even know, every time she asks me to tail the boss, she gives me money."

Later, he finally quit his job. It wasn't that the boss didn't want him, but that he needed more time to settle down for himself. He found a coffee shop opened by an acquaintance from Fujian. He made coffee with him, sweating, and learned charcoal portraiture from him. He wanted to learn to draw portraits so that he could freely direct himself and not be occupied by others. The above is what I knew when I was in Yangon. After returning to China, he also corresponded with me a few times. Although there were many typos, the meaning and emotions were expressed clearly. The year before last, Ah Guang, a Cantonese typesetter (I plan to talk about this person in another article), edited the Coconut Breeze Weekly on the Yangon Daily News. He even used the pen name Meng Xing (meaning awakened from a dream), and wrote several short sketches. The real life of a worker's original color, mixed with the folk songs and dialects of Shidian, Yunnan, made me feel interested and surprised. Last year, I received a letter from Ah Huang, saying that he had returned to his hometown and opened a photography studio with a monk friend in the Bai area of Yunnan, and he was actually working as a photographer. Then, he said that for some reason, the chieftain had sealed his business. Where is he now? This young friend who keeps struggling. I hope that when I hear from him again, it will still be a series of surprises!

### Solo

— Qin Zihao

Few audience members

But the curtain rises

A girl stands on the stage

Small like a pigeon

The audience's eagle eyes shoot at her heart

Because she has the expression of an actor

She is singing a rhapsody

But why is the accompanying music so sad

The singing is not harmonious

The accompanying music is too suffocating

She tries her best to express her tenderness in her movements

Those ladies cast envious eyes at her

The audience seems to be falling asleep

Her song is over

But there is not a single cheer from the audience

Not even applause

Too sweet songs have too bitter tears

Her youth has reached the moment of burning

Life has turned her passion into cold ashes

In the cold ashes are her countless hot tears

### Exodus

— You Qi

On a rainy night, the seasonal winter wind blew in through the window cracks, and the curtains moved.

Guarding that dim lamp, taking advantage of this rare day of rest, I thought, it should be time for a wanderer to write a letter home. I picked up my pen, what should I write? The most important thing, of course, is the state of life, but, how should I start writing about an ordinary encounter? Hesitating, annoyed, I thought I'd better give up this attempt at reporting!

Just as I was pondering, a very light step opened the door. A gray cotton robe was soaked in the rain, and rainwater dripped from his hair, covering his entire face. A few stiff whiskers added to his older years, and his eyes were so panicked and melancholy! This friend, whom I hadn't seen in more than a year, had become so decadent. Really, if it weren't for the familiar facial contours that gave me an unmistakable sign, I could simply have other illusions.

He sat down, the lamplight shone on him, and teardrops fell to the ground, as if with endless grievances.

He was silent, and didn't speak for a long time, allowing the air disturbed by the ticking of the clock to maintain a moment's distance between us.

"This will become an eternal and indelible case!" he said, indignantly, "A weak villager, standing in front of a powerful local gentry, for the sake of—ah, what can I say?"...

The village, needless to say, is naturally not as good as before. Natural disasters, plus banditry, plus usurious loans, and piecemeal extortion, these give the villagers not "prosperity", but go in the opposite direction towards the road of "decline", and thus, cause the local gentry a fatal blow. Extortion is, in fact, impossible, and even the interest on usurious loans cannot be obtained. In those people's eyes, there is only "coercion"! He casually sipped a mouthful of hot tea, and the events passed through his head like a horse running by, and he laughed coldly.

You probably still remember Wang Wu from West Street, right? That sturdy young man, who was not afraid of the sun or the wind, worked for this family all year round and did some odd jobs. He was honest enough, and you rarely saw him get angry. Who knew that the root of the disaster was planted on the head of his wife who hadn't consummated the marriage?

That young wife had some beauty, the so-called beauty was not the kind of妖 in the city, but a natural kind of simple beauty, which aroused Binggen's covetousness. You may not have forgotten, right?—Binggen, is the son of the big landlord whom Wang Wu is employed by. That guy once fought with me twice, and as a result, he was easily given some lessons. "Losing out", he considered to be the supreme insult. Several times, he also instructed the servants to repay past hatred, but, after all, it was he who suffered the pain, unless he didn't come out. Hatred was planted very deeply among us.

For the sake of oppression, for the sake of intimidation, how could a weak underage woman resist this violent giving? Finally, one autumn night, the dense bushes reflected and covered, becoming an excellent screen. Autumn insects shook the entire earth, and moonlight smeared a corner of the treetops. In the quiet and solemn night, who knew that behind the bushes, there was an uneasy atmosphere!

After death, this matter was quickly discovered, and needless to say, in addition to the corporal punishment of the young wife, the eyes, all the resentment, was focused on the initiator.

His face sank, making the air in the small building even more serious.

The days were fast, and half a month passed in a calm storm. Speaking of which, autumn brings people the boredom of loneliness. On the back mountain where I lived, it seemed even more terrifyingly lonely at night. The back mountain was indeed scary. During the day, other than a few wild children picking up the wild grass and dry branches that no one cared for, this place was cut off from human traces as soon as it turned to dusk. The people who liked to gossip said that they had seen the appearance of ghost fire. On one stormy night, I heard a groaning cry. Braving the wind and rain, I took a storm lantern and rushed out. Unexpectedly, I never thought that the one lying on the ground was actually Binggen! Rolling around, not looking like himself, finally, his mouth opened a few times, as if with infinite remorse. It was over, the groaning lowered, and could not be heard.

The next day, rumors spread that because of something something in the past, "suspicion" will also be implicated!

His face was terrifyingly green, and I simply didn't dare to look directly at him. Finally, he swallowed the only remaining bit of hot tea, hurriedly left his seat, and shook my hand. How cold his palm was! —The cold and unfamiliar land will be the object of my drifting from now on. He said, walked down the stairs, and the alley walls swallowed his figure. A drizzle shot over, perhaps symbolizing his destiny!

### Fragments of Private Life

— Lei Shiyu

A cigarette, a chalk,

The cigarette burns out its own soul,

But cannot shed the blood of the soul;

Chalk white as snow,

Muscles stick to the blackboard,

Saliva dyes the brown and green hair white;

Faces of young people line up in front of me

Such bloody smiles,

I suspect I'm a clown;

But their pupils are so bright,

Clearly excavating the vague truths from me,

But they will also cry passionately,

I hate that I haven't shed tears first.

The clock strikes mechanically and monotonously,

It really shatters my lead heart!

### “China Rises Like the Sun in the East”

— Ying Chun

According to a report on the 15th: "Former Consul-General to Nanjing, Mr. Suma, has given numerous lectures on Sino-Japanese issues at the invitation of various organizations and groups since returning to Tokyo. Local circles believe that Mr. Suma, having been stationed in China for eleven years and having participated in various important negotiations, his observations are of great importance. Mr. Suma, in his lecture 'The Current Situation of the Nanjing Government and the Future of Sino-Japanese Relations' at the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun's East Asia Research, praised the increasing consolidation of China's unification and the improvement of discipline in the Chinese army. He also stated that China's unification is due to the 'Guangdong Spirit,' a novel term. In conclusion, Mr. Suma cited a foreign person's saying: 'Japan is like the setting sun, China is like the rising sun,' warning the audience to pay serious attention to Sino-Japanese relations in the future."

Mr. Suma's position among Japanese diplomats in China seems to be quite high, and the cases he has handled seem to be numerous. Therefore, his careful speech—some discretion is expected—is naturally what we anticipate. This time, in Tokyo, he actually spoke some good words about China, which is not surprising. Those skilled in rhetoric are often always smiling, especially since he is a diplomat. However, there is a common Chinese saying: "A dagger hidden in a smile," meaning that a smiling face does not necessarily harbor good intentions. We certainly cannot say that Mr. Suma is one of these people, because we are afraid of unintentionally slighting the envoy of our "friendly nation."

However, in recent years, we have lost vast territories, and those who "negotiate" between coercion and inducement are often these envoys. We sincerely wish to be "friendly with our friendly nations," but how can we be "friendly"! The death of one Japanese resident immediately leads to the Beihai Incident, the Chengdu Incident, and the Hankou Incident, which not only makes the local people uneasy but also puts the Chinese government in a difficult diplomatic position. Major upheavals are constant. —Naturally, this is because they know our weaknesses, so they take great advantage. As the military strategists say: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." They can be said to be deeply aware of our internal affairs. The deployment of spies throughout our interior is chilling to think about.

Mr. Suma's lecture this time cannot be said to be a reflection of a deep understanding of China's situation. Our unification is naturally disadvantageous to them. The saying "Japan is like the setting sun, China is like the rising sun" is not actually "good words," but he used it to "warn" the Japanese audience to "pay serious attention to Sino-Japanese relations." I remember not long ago, Major General Matsumuro, who replaced Doihara as head of the special services agency, also spoke eloquently about China's political situation in an intelligence report. Mr. Suma and Mr. Matsumuro do not seem to be very different. They say China is unified. This unification is facilitated by the "Guangdong Spirit." What is the "Guangdong Spirit"? We do not need to delve into it, but there is no doubt that they hope this "spirit" will not last. The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is a sign of China's unification and revitalization. We hope that in this plenary session, we will concretely decide on our strategies and future for national salvation. Then, we will truly "rise like the sun in the east" and embark on a broad path of diligent governance.

### Congratulations and Get Rich

— Ruyi

During the New Year, when relatives and friends meet, they almost always say "Congratulations and get rich."

Getting rich is a happy thing, but it is definitely not possible to get rich just by saying "Get rich." As the saying goes: "A healthy body leads to wealth." It can be seen that good health is a prerequisite for getting rich.

To be healthy, you also need to take tonic and nourishing medicines. For example, those with high blood pressure should take blood-enriching medicines, and those with weak lungs should take cod liver oil. Among blood-enriching medicines, "Zilai Blood" is definitely the most effective. Among cod liver oils, "Five Continents Milky White Cod Liver Oil" and "Globe Brand Malt Cod Liver Oil" are definitely the most nourishing. Taking them in time will definitely make your body strong and your spirit vigorous, creating a golden career.

### On Her Dressing Table

— Zhong Xiang

There is an exquisite residence on Yuyuan Road. The owner of this residence is a certain lady. Because the owner loves elegance and cleanliness, the house is especially tidy, especially her bedroom, which is decorated in a quiet style. On a dressing table, there are several kinds of cosmetics, and the bottle styles and decorations are very beautiful.

The cosmetics displayed on this dressing table are a bottle of "131 Hair Water," a bottle of "33 Perfume," a bottle of "Yipin Fragrant Snow Cream," and a bottle of "Planet Brand Honey Fragrance." It turns out that these are all products of the Five Continents Pharmacy, and they have three characteristics: good quality, fragrant smell, and cheap price. Such high-quality domestic products are most suitable for display on the dressing table of a noble lady.

### By the Side of Gaisel Lake

— Zhang Hai

Disturbed all night by the fierce barking of dogs, we, whose bodies were soaked with fatigue, could not sleep peacefully. As soon as it dawned, a strange and noisy sound was seething outside the Mongolian yurt, which made people uncomfortable, especially the hoarse sounds of cattle and the mournful bleating of sheep mixed together, stabbing directly into people's ears. The plain was like a troubled person, unable to calm down at all. Our host, that kind teacher in his forties, was groping in a dark room, the cigarette holder in his mouth flashing a faint red flame. He knelt down before the Buddhist shrine and silently recited prayers. After a while, he blew a horn outside the yurt and drove the herd of livestock to the pasture for grazing.

The hostess squatted by the stove to make a fire. Old horse dung emitted a smelly odor as it burned. She was busy and walked back and forth in the yurt, as if there was something wrong with her brain. She didn't know what food and drink to use to entertain us. My fellow traveler, the Buryat Mongolian Basula, told her in Khalkha that we had brought our own food and could cook it ourselves, so she shouldn't bother. But she refused. She almost got angry. She said, "Do you look down on us? We like guests the most! You have come from afar and rarely come to our place. How can you not eat something from us!" We couldn't refuse to eat her breakfast.

After eating, we wanted to leave. The camel driver had urged us two or three times, saying that if we didn't leave early, we probably wouldn't be able to reach "Banta" tonight, because there were no wells to be found in "Kanlinte," and we had to stay overnight in "Banta." But the hostess didn't want us to leave right away. She wanted to take us to see "Gaisel Lake."

Led by the hostess, the four of us went to a livestock pen to the west, and everyone got a horse to ride. Soon we stepped onto a main road.

"This main road was only built last year. The idea was from the ×× people. The lamas and princes forced us people to build it. To tell you the truth, none of us people often walk on this main road. It's the cars of the ×× people that keep running back and forth on this main road."

Sunshine was scattered across the wilderness, and herds of livestock were squirming on the grassland. The horses joyfully neighed. Ivanovitch, who hadn't opened his mouth from morning until now, hummed the "Volga" folk song as if lost in memories. He reined in his horse on one side, deliberately wanting to distance himself from us a little. This fellow traveler was often like this. He didn't like to walk and stroll with others. In Harbin, friends called him "the lonely black bear."

## Page 20

"Gaisel Lake" is not as beautiful as "West Lake." In fact, it is a small bay with a few jujube trees on the embankment, and the reeds grow very short. I was disappointed! I can simply say that I was fooled by the hostess! She knew what we meant from the look on our faces. She said intimately:

"The lake really isn't much to see. I didn't want you to come here to see the lake scenery. I want to tell you something."

She led us to the large plain by the lake. There was a square here, built very flat.

"Did you see that! This is a drill ground. The ×× people forced King × to have us build it well. King × then went everywhere to pick young men to be soldiers. Some were willing to go and be soldiers themselves. King × gave each of them a gun and taught them how to fire and how to fight. Every day, morning and evening, there are large teams of people practicing fighting on this field. One day, ten horsemen came from somewhere, passing by here, and were caught by the ×× people! It is said that they were spies sent by the Buryat Republic. Without asking any questions, they tied up the ten people, poured kerosene on their hair, and then lit it. Two soldiers carried one person, and when their hair was burning fiercely, they threw them into the lake with force. In this way, ten people of unknown origin were thrown alive into the lake and drowned! Now all the young men in our "Shalsha" area have been transported away! I heard that they were transported to Suiyuan to fight! Oh! Aren't you also going to Suiyuan? But in "Shalsha," you must not say that you are going to Suiyuan. If the lamas and princes find out, you will lose your lives!"

The four of us fellow travelers dismounted at the same time and bowed deeply to the hostess, expressing our utmost gratitude to her.

It was already close to noon when we left Shalsha. I was wary of the road ahead.

### A Record of a Trip Around the World by Air (Part 1)

— Written by Dr. Falconer of the United States, specially translated

I served in the American civil service all my life until 1931, when I finally retired. Since then, I have spent my time traveling. I have traveled around the world four times before, and this year I decided to travel around the world again by air. I live in the state of Texas. My initial plan was to fly from Dallas to Miami, take a Pan American Airlines plane to the capital of Brazil, then take the Graf Zeppelin airship to Germany, and then take an Imperial Airways, French Airlines, or Royal Dutch Airlines plane to the East, and then take a Pan American Airlines Clipper back to the United States.

Just as I was about to buy a ticket, I saw in the newspaper that the new German airship Hindenburg would begin flying across the Atlantic in May, departing from Frankfurt, Germany, and ending in Lakehurst, New Jersey, USA. So I changed my plan and flew from Dallas to Newark, New Jersey, on May 8, a distance of 1,402 miles, taking ten and a half hours.

From May 11 to May 14, I took the Hindenburg from Lakehurst to Frankfurt, a distance of 4,500 miles, taking 49 hours and 3 minutes. The Hindenburg was a very large airship, with 25 rooms, each accommodating two passengers, with two sleeping berths and hot and cold water faucets inside. The ship had a large dining room, writing room, card room, bar, bathroom, and a promenade deck. The chairs and utensils in the ship were all made of aluminum, making them very light. Each side of the ship had long glass windows about three feet high and fifty feet wide, allowing passengers to look down at the land and sea from the windows during flight.

The average altitude of ordinary airplanes is about two miles above the ground, but the Hindenburg airship was only 700 feet above the ground, so when it flew over New York City, we could see the two hands of the street clock clearly from the ship. The main reason it flew so low was that the air at this altitude is denser than the air above, so less oxygen is needed to support the airship in the sky. There were 51 passengers on this flight. The fare from Lakehurst to Frankfurt, including meals and gratuities, was only US$400. Recently, the ship added twelve more rooms, so it can carry a total of 72 passengers. The entire journey from Lakehurst to Frankfurt is 4,500 miles long, with no stops along the way. At the beginning of the journey, it flew over New York City and other places, entered Europe, and flew over Ireland, Scotland, and northern Germany, which was very interesting.

The commander of the flight cabin was Dr. Eckener. I had a conversation with him thanks to his kindness. According to him, he believed that the Zeppelin airship would definitely become a common means of crossing the Atlantic in the future. Germany will soon build three sister ships of the Hindenburg, so there will be a total of four Zeppelin airships flying between Frankfurt and New York. He also said that the large Zeppelin has traveled between Europe and South America more than a hundred times, carrying nearly 30,000 passengers, and no one has lost their life.

or injured, Dr. Kneipps, the mayor of Frankfurt, also took the Hindenburg back and forth this time. After returning to his city, he held a reception at the Gu Shi Town Hall, which lasted from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Many famous citizens of the city also attended this grand event. At the end of the meeting, he gave each guest a badge with a silver silhouette of the Hindenburg printed on a blue background, and a certificate printed on parchment, proving that he was one of the passengers on the first flight of the Hindenburg from Lakehurst to Frankfurt.

### Brightness

— Li Liwen

The school saved electricity, and I saved money, so I spent a winter vacation in the dark.

Every day, when the sky began to darken, my terror arrived…

My courage was not great in the first place, and my mind was filled with various bizarre and absurd stories of gods and ghosts like every Chinese person. Lying alone in the house in the dark, I couldn't help but shudder in my heart and feel scared… In the darkness, it was originally the world of all kinds of demons and ghosts. The more afraid I was, it was as if something was really crying in the dark, sneering in the dark, and even reaching out a cold hand. A chill ran down my spine, I shrank my head into the quilt, unable to sleep all night, hoping that it would dawn soon, hoping that the first crowing of the rooster would come soon…

From then on, I knew more deeply why light is so lovely?

"Why are they so stupid," I often thought when I was a child. Now I know why those poor moths are willing to die in the fire.

Opening Chapter "Sweeping Qin"

Don't laugh at his foolish and crazy appearance, the Bodhisattva of Earth Treasure deliberately descends to the mortal world. He borrows a body to sit in meditation at Lingyin Temple, and writes poems on the wall to sweep away Qin. The current prime minister comes to offer incense, holding three sticks of incense in his hand, lowering his head to silently communicate with the gods. He only wishes for favorable weather and a peaceful country, and only seeks a long spring for the couple. He protects Yue Fei and his son, wishing them early transcendence to the immortal realm. Raising his head and suddenly seeing the poem, the treacherous hero trembles in shock. This poem was written with his wife, and when the matter is exposed, he is burned by a raging fire, and immediately angrily asks the mad monk. He doesn't know that he spits out Zen secrets and is full of changes, calling wind and rain, and is all-powerful. He holds a fire tube to communicate with foreign countries, and also takes a palm broom to sweep away treacherous officials. The storm is only caused by monopolizing power, and he dies unjustly at Lengquan Pavilion. Returning home, the couple discuss together, shaving their heads and converting to Buddhism, but they seek fame. They listen to the slander of a long-tongued woman, and suffer all the punishments of Fengdu hell. To this day, their whole bodies are cast in iron at Yue Wang's tomb.

### About "Song at Midnight"

"Song at Midnight" is a suspenseful horror masterpiece directed by Ma Xubang. It has taken as long as eight months from production to the present. During the work, Ma Xubang even vomited blood several times, which shows his attention and dedication to this film.

Many people have tried to make horror movies, but in the end they didn't succeed. The unwillingness to make a decision is certainly one of the reasons. In fact, the root cause lies in the limitations of material conditions. Xinhua Company's productions have always been known for their sophistication and perfection. With the full availability of technical conditions, the satisfactory harvest of "Song at Midnight" will surely surprise you.

In terms of performance, "Song at Midnight" is always immersed in an atmosphere of horror, pushing strangeness and absurdity to the extreme, but its story is very realistic and targets this unreasonable society.

The strength of the cast is also worth mentioning. Jinshan's makeup as a hideous monster is not only realistic, but especially the inner performance will surely evoke sympathy. Hu Ping's portrayal of a lady from a noble family, Shi Chao's portrayal of a handsome young man, Zhou Wenzhu's portrayal of a rickety old woman, Gu Menghu's portrayal of a纨绔子弟, Xu Manli's portrayal of a young girl, and Wang Weiyi's portrayal of a strange old man all do their best to reach the realm of perfection.

### Baby Bai Ling's Another Great Work "Rainbow Shadow and Floral Voice" Showing at the Great Shanghai Theater

Baby Bai Ling, the nine-year-old child prodigy in "Liyuan Thinks of Her Son," will meet the audience again at the Great Shanghai Theater starting today. The film is titled "Rainbow Shadow and Floral Voice." Baby Bai Ling plays a lonely orphan who sells flowers on the street and sings a clear song. Baby Bai Ling's talented singing voice has already given the audience a very deep impression in the film "Liyuan Thinks of Her Son." Superstar Eddie Cantor once hired him to co-broadcast on the radio and called him one of the greatest personalities on the screen and stage. Baby Bai Ling gives full play to his strengths in this film, singing seven or eight times. Among them are old folk songs, solemn sacred songs, and lively black famous songs. The most beautiful is the "Galaxy Rainbow Shadow Song," whose melody is melodious and touches people's hearts. Supporting actors include the old woman star Mei Laura Robson, and the humor master Charles Spalding, etc.

### "Our Children's Theater Society's First Recruitment of Members Continued News"

"Our Children's Theater Society," located inside the New Central Theater at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road in this city, is China's only permanent children's theater society, and it is a group organized by children themselves. After they performed "Wild Children" last Christmas, they prepared for the first public performance of a one-act children's play "Education of Love." They rehearsed for more than a month, and saved their candy money to raise a sum of money, but because they could not find a theater in the Nanshi Zhabei area, they submitted the script to the concession for review, hoping to perform in a certain large theater. Now, they have begun their first recruitment of members, preparing to expand the organization before the public performance and convene an inaugural meeting, requesting all circles to give them some guidance and some help. Since the news of their recruitment of members was published in various newspapers, many people have written letters to ask for the charter. Several letters were written jointly by children, which shows that the children in this city are very fond of drama. The children's drama movement is worthy of our attention and help. It is said that Mu Xie, the author of "Wild Children," also wrote to them, willing to guide them, which is also something we are happy about. These days, the ticket office of the New Central Theater often has children asking about the society, preparing to participate. But impatient children who run there before 3:00 PM always make a wasted trip and do not see the staff of the society. Because the staff of the society are all studying, or doing apprenticeships, they can only come to the society after 3:00 PM every day, so please don't go too early for those children who have gone or want to go in the future. Finally, I want to tell everyone a good news, the society's recent work is experimenting with "shadow puppets"; and this Sunday afternoon at 3:00, they will hold a tea party, and there will be singing and other entertainment, and they also welcome children who love drama to participate.

### "Serve the Country With Utmost Loyalty" Showing in Paris

"Serve the Country With Utmost Loyalty" is one of the ten major films of 1936 and is indeed the leader in war films. It inspires patriotic ideas and depicts battlefield life. Judging from the stars of the film, Fredric March, Warner Baxter, and Lionel Barrymore, the joint performance of three giants is even more valuable. Wherever this film goes, it is crowded. Paris is taking advantage of the beginning of this new spring to contribute to a continuous stream of masterpieces after "Ramona" and "The Island of Injustice". The next film to be released in succession has already been scheduled for Eddie Cantor's "Peach and Plum Blossoms Blooming".

"Siamese Lotus" is a masterpiece co-created by the Southern fairy Zi Luolan and the famous young actor Wu Chufan. The plot takes love as the theme, depicting young men and women advocating free union and opposing the old-fashioned marriage with feudal colors, with meticulous depiction. The filming of the play is about to be completed.

Huang Ximo's screenplay "Three Stars Accompanying the Moon" uses a light-hearted style to describe a theme centered on promoting Chinese industrial and commercial undertakings and praising the Principle of People's Livelihood. It is a masterpiece with great realism, and has great song and dance scenes interspersed enthusiastically. The play is directed by Fang Peilin and will be filmed simultaneously with "Mysterious Flower."

Yi Hua Company's new lineup for the first half of the year, in addition to the currently released "Incarnation Girl Sequel" and "Full Garden Spring Scenery," the remaining six blockbusters such as "Elastic Daughter," "Siamese Lotus," "Sea and Sky Lovers," "Mysterious Flower," "Three Stars Accompanying the Moon," and "Female God of Wealth" must be completed in sequence and released successively.
