### British Prime Minister Chamberlain Makes Another Plea for Peace, Saying He Wishes to Be Friends With Those Who Obey the Law, German Newspaper Hints at Anglo-German Talks

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain, speaking in Edinburgh today, said that he is making renewed efforts to conduct a closer study of the roots and realities of fear and suspicion and to find ways to eliminate them. Now is the time to see if this is feasible. Such efforts are not a sign of weakness, for the British Empire is now very strong and growing stronger every day. He has faith in human nature and believes that this call will have an immediate impact. The general policy of the British government is to advance British interests, protect British lives, maintain peace, and foster friendly relations with all countries that wish to befriend us and abide by international law. Without such law and order, there can be no stability. The Prime Minister continued, saying that Britain's prosperity today is greater than that of any other major industrial nation. We must expect some ups and downs, but in the near future, or for a very long time, there will be no decline. Some say that after the rearmament program is completed, commerce will decline, but he does not think this will happen for the time being. What he fears most is that Britain's rearmament will take many years. (Special dispatch from the Tzu Lin Pao on the 12th)

[London] Sir Nasmyth, Under-Secretary of the Admiralty, speaking last night about the expansion of the navy, said that the warships currently being equipped total about 580,000 tons. However, training the personnel needed to expand the fleet is a difficult task. He believes that the success of the recruitment campaign is due to the public's awareness that the British Navy is a public element standing between law and order and world turmoil. The number of naval recruits this year has increased fourfold compared to 1932, he said. (Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

[London] Regarding future talks between the British and German authorities, the diplomatic correspondent of the Standard Evening News recently stated that after Foreign Secretary Eden returns from Brussels, he will discuss everything with Lord Halifax, Lord Privy Seal, in order to determine the instructions that Lord Halifax should carry with him when he goes to Germany. According to intelligence received by the British government, if German leader Hitler can obtain a little encouragement from the British side, he is prepared to propose to Britain a "truce" on the old colonial issue for ten years, temporarily refraining from raising it. The condition for this exchange is that the British government must allow Germany to take action in Central Europe without interference. Such actions include: (1) Germany obtaining the power to force Austria to hold free general elections or a referendum to decide the political system; (2) Germany obtaining the power to demand that Czechoslovakia recognize that German minorities within its borders can enjoy autonomy within the scope of the country's cultural unity. However, in the first case, Austria would inevitably adopt a National Socialist system; in the second case, after German minorities in Czechoslovakia enjoy autonomy, the influence that the Soviet Union holds in the Czechoslovak government would be lost. In reality, it seems that leader Hitler attaches even more importance to the Austrian question. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

[Berlin] A semi-official National Socialist Party communication published an article here today raising an alarming question, arguing that the current international situation is extremely tense and that Lord Halifax, Lord Privy Seal, should postpone his visit to Germany. The communication declared that if Anglo-German talks were held at this time, certain issues would certainly be off-limits for discussion, such as Germany's relationship with Italy and Japan. Germany does not want to exert influence over its allies and wants to adjust or change only matters related to these countries. In addition, Germany does not want these talks to be aimed at "reconciling the Western powers." The communication then strongly refuted the statement in the London Standard Evening News that Hitler had stated to Britain that he would agree not to discuss the colonial issue for ten years, on the condition that Britain agree to Germany's freedom of action in Central Europe. It asserted that this statement was absolutely absurd, and that Germany has already adjusted its relations with Central European countries through treaty relations and does not need foreign help, consent, or permission. The so-called German abandonment of colonial claims is entirely a fabrication of public opinion to confuse the public. If Halifax makes a prejudiced visit in such an atmosphere, it would be better to postpone it temporarily for the sake of reducing international tensions until British public opinion is more moderate and the environment is more appropriate for Anglo-German talks.

### French Human Rights League Declaration Condemns Japan Arbitrary Slaughter Incites World Outrage Countries Should Further Restrain Aggression

[Paris] The French Human Rights League has 100,000 members, many of whom are celebrities and scholars. The League recently issued a declaration on the Japanese slaughter of Chinese civilians. The full text is as follows: The Executive Committee of the French Human Rights League hereby protests against the various atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China, especially the planned bombing of undefended cities and the slaughter of civilians. These acts are now arousing the outrage of the civilized world, as can be seen from the resolutions passed by the League of Nations. The Human Rights League shares this deep indignation. However, it is not enough to simply declare that "these actions are inexcusable" and solemnly condemn them. To ensure that "these actions" are not repeated in China, and that similar actions do not occur elsewhere, all countries that respect human life must not remain passive. Since the beginning of the Spanish war, all countries have consistently adopted a passive attitude, and the Spanish war was actually a precursor to the Chinese war. The proposals in Geneva to provide financial and technical assistance to the victims of Japanese bombing are commendable, but it would be better if all countries could refuse to supply the aggressor with the fuel, coal, or kerosene necessary for the navy and air force, so that the aggressor would be unable to engage in bombing and slaughter. For this reason, the Human Rights League specifically requests the League of Nations, the governments of all peace-loving countries, and all labor organizations to find ways to resist all goods from aggressor countries and to assist the countries that have been invaded, so that all acts of aggression will have no way to succeed."

### Eastern Battlefield Left Wing Huaihai Inspection Notes

—Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Yuan Zhenyu—

Central News Agency, Xinpu Dispatch: The roaring China has already embarked on a great future in the war of resistance against Japan's arrogant aggression. Regardless of difficulties, without shrinking back, for the peace of human justice, for the freedom and equality of China, we are prepared to resist to the end.

The persistent annihilation and guerrilla warfare at any time and any place are the strategies we have adopted. This already unfolded battle situation has been divided into four major units in terms of the situation. The reporter will try to make the following distinctions:

Eastern Battlefield—Jinghu Line, Su-Bo
Western Battlefield—Pingsui, Tongpu, Zhengtai Line
Southern Battlefield—Min-Yue
Northern Battlefield—Pinghan, Jinpu, Jiaoji Line

If we regard Shanghai as the front of the Eastern Battlefield, Zhejiang is naturally the right wing, and the Longhai Line should be the left wing. On the front of the Eastern Battlefield, we have sustained nearly three months of bloody battles with the posture of annihilating the enemy's main force, causing the enemy to reinforce six times and "launch a general offensive" five times, with 100,000 casualties in the main force. The purpose of the war of attrition has been completely achieved. From the beginning, we also prepared for the enemy to inevitably attack Lianyungang, the eastern end of the left wing. It is hard to say now, there is no formal war yet, but the enemy ships' exploratory "attacks," the artillery battles on land and sea of Lianyungang, have already begun.

The Situation of Lianyungang

Lianyungang, which is usually unnoticed by the general public, has had a slight impact on China's import and export trade since this commercial port was roughly built in 1925. However, the period of prosperity to become an oriental second-class port is still very far away. However, today, the war tool to deal with the sea bandits relies on it to maintain the overall strategic advantage of the north and south. Therefore, we must firmly defend Lianyungang and fundamentally crush the enemy's attempt to land in Lianyungang and invade the west. We must turn Yunyun Port into a "port for annihilating the enemy" and a "port for sinking the invaders."

The vein of Mount Tai, a branch extending south from Rizhao and Linyi, enters Haizhou from the north in the eastern field of the Huai River Plain. A Jinping Mountain is formed on the edge of Haizhou City, and then extends eastward for thirty or forty miles to the southeast on the right side of the Linhong Estuary, directly facing the sea and forming another Yuntai Mountain with a circumference of two hundred miles. It is said that a few decades ago, the middle of Yuntai Mountain and Jinping Mountain was still a sea, and Yuntai Mountain was just an isolated island in the sea. In the early years of the Republic of China, ships of 2,200 tons could enter Linhong and reach Haizhou City directly. Now these places have been made "mulberry fields" from the sea. The siltation of the Chao River and the Linhong Estuary has left only a few dilapidated sailing ships. Therefore, the state port in the National Construction Strategy has to be moved eight or nine thousand miles eastward, to the side of Yuntai Mountain facing the sea. Coincidentally, there is another rocky mountain in the sea east of Yuntai Mountain, called the East and West Lian Islands, which act as a barrier in front. The harbor between this mountain and the island, eight miles wide and more than ten miles long, is now Lianyungang. It is also what the National Construction Strategy calls the sea access of Haizhou. The deep-water route can be said to be better than the coast of the 150-mile northern border along the Yangtze River. "This one point can accommodate ocean-going giant ships approaching the shore within a few miles." In terms of military defense, it occupies such an absolutely strategic location. In the position, the sharp end of the arc-shaped extension of the coast eighty miles north of Linhong Estuary is Lanshantou in Andongwei, Shandong Province, which is also a strategic location. During the Ming Dynasty, Qi Jiguang's pirates landed here. Ninety miles away is Shijiusuo. During the European War, the Japanese army attacked and looted Qingdao and landed here. Forty miles south of Yuntai Mountain is Lieqiankou, sixty miles away is the Guanhe Estuary, and a hundred miles away is the old Yellow River Estuary, which is now the outlet of the Huai River. This coastal area has a characteristic. Wherever there are mountains on the coast, the sea is deep; otherwise, twenty or thirty miles out to sea are all shallow beaches. However, both are equally conducive to defense. After arriving in Haizhou, the reporter went to the coast to visit this seaport standing on the front line of national defense. The group set out from Haizhou City at the foot of Jinping Mountain. The car drove across a plain for a mile. Near the foot of Yuntai Mountain, the land and sea trains were also running from east to west. Suddenly, we discovered that three airplanes were chasing the train in mid-air. The train fled urgently on the vast plain. Another long-distance bus also ran away in a panic. We got out of the car, lay in the wild grass, and indignantly "appreciated" this picture of modern civilization. Now we are still in the era of scientific manufacturing of war, and we hope that one day, science can also eliminate war. The stimulating picture passed like a movie. I walked into the foot of Yuntai Mountain. Everyone was surprised that this huge rocky mountain grew out of the thousands of miles of plains by the sea without walls. The cliffs undulated, and there was actually the momentum of thousands of mountains overlapping. In the mountain streams, there were also slight sails following the leisurely water.

Seventy miles past Xugou Town, the car went along the mountain and by the sea. The brilliance of the sea was truly fascinating in the midday sun. The near side was a line of crimson, the far side a deep blue, silent humor and mystery. Further away, a silver-white flash,夹着嫩玉的光辉, truly “the autumn water shares the same color as the long sky.” We were immersed in the sea’s sentiment, and reached the distant and unfamiliar Lianyungang. However, our mood was so 친切.

The inside and outside of the port are so quiet, as if after a storm, or waiting for a storm to come. A few immobile boats floated on the water. No tourists were seen. The arbitrary low-altitude bombing by enemy aircraft for three hours on September 21, damaged the wharf and seawall contracted by the Dutch port management company for 3.5 million yuan in many places. The warehouse on the main wharf was completely destroyed. The 370,000-yuan Aihai Building that had been newly built was left with a dilapidated shell. The steel frame of the coal loading machine, which was more than 300 meters long, was also damaged. Here, the enemy only paid the price of bombs, which seemed too cheap for them. Our loss of at least one million is difficult to estimate. This is one of the brutal impressions left by the destroyers of civilization. It is a debt in the countless accounts of the past sixty years. It is also a debt that we must settle with them this time.

Lianyungang City is built along the mountain, with stone walls and red tiles, and tall buildings like clouds, reflected under the high mountains and cliffs. Looking east, the sky and water are misty, and facing the East and West Lian Islands, it can be compared with Hong Kong and Qingdao.

Taking a speedboat across the inner harbor for more than ten minutes, we reached West Lian Island. The island is also a rocky mountain, fifteen miles long from east to west, and forty miles in circumference. The connecting surface does not separate, so it is called Lian Island. It is heard that there are two ancient temples, and hundreds of fishermen live at the foot of the mountain, continuing their business as before. Thousands of Zhang fish nets in the Inner Harbor are exposed at low tide, forming horizontal and vertical rows on the water surface, which look like aircraft formations in a wide field when viewed from the county. This impression suddenly makes people painful. How can we have so many aircraft to defend this famous mountain and sea?

At the time of the sun's westward deviation, a group of people mustered the courage to climb Yuntai Peak. Looking out, the mountains and seas are all in sight. Yuntai is like a lying dragon, but there is a pair of awakening lions intertwining their necks in front. Beigushan and Zhuge, two small islands on the right side of Wuhongkou, and the peaks of Yuntai Lian Island rely on each other. The overall situation of the port comes from Dachen, "Difficulties in all directions strengthen the climb." But we have no sadness, only excitement. We wish that the good men of China would unite and move forward courageously to protect this 4,000-year-old mountain and river that has fallen slightly.

The Situation on the Huai River Plain

The reporter believes that the Huai River Plain area, sandwiched between the front line of the Eastern Battlefield and the left wing line, is also quite important in the future battle situation. In order to explore the various situations in between, starting from Nanjing, we took the road through Zhenjiang, went north along the Grand Canal, passing through Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaian, Huaiyin, and then followed the Yunyan River down to Lianshui Guanyun to reach Donghai, from the Hongze Lake and Gaoyou Lake unfolding this large plain, although it is flat for thousands of miles, but the rivers are crisscrossed, and divided into countless irregular small blocks. South of Huaiyin, water flows out of the Yangtze River. On the south bank of the Grand Canal, dikes are built to prevent flooding. People gather on the dike, building houses and living there, for more than 300 miles, with uninterrupted villages. On one side, houses are lined up, and on the other side, the highway is vast. The Grand Canal flowing south ends in Huaiyin. North of Huaiyin, the North Grand Canal ends in Xita, connecting to a large arc, turning eastward to the Yunyan River. The water in this Yunyan River area does not enter the Yangtze River from the South Grand Canal in Huaiyin, but from Huaiyin through Lianshui Guanyun and the Chao River converges at Xinpu in the East China Sea, and the mountain Linhong Estuary goes out to sea. In between, it is also intertwined with many tributaries of the Guan River. Looking down at this large plain from the air, it can be seen that the terrain is complex. If it is used as a battlefield, the attacking side will inevitably fall into an extremely painful river and lake obstacle war.

In this area, local governments are busy with wartime supplies or preparations. Every city has established a public organization committee. The situation is tense and encouraging. However, their control and organization strength seems to be more obvious in the urban intellectuals, but there are several serious facts reflected.

Recently, various counties have been ordered to conscript soldiers, using a lottery method to conscript. Those who have been trained and understand the great righteousness and volunteer are naturally worthy of commendation and comforting. However, in some places, there are inevitable actions to escape or resist conscription. It is said that the reasons are not simple. The main reason is naturally that the public does not understand the meaning of conscription. But why don't they understand? The public cannot be responsible for this. In order to complete the task within the time limit, the local government had to take compulsory measures. Therefore, many malpractices occurred. Rich families use money to redeem their sons, and some people actually select and add names that were not drawn in the lottery. Some people even take the opportunity to "arrest" a few more and profit from it. These few unscrupulous township pao-jia chiefs and conscription personnel have directly damaged the anti-enemy front line. The difficulty and effort are increased, and naturally the distance between the public and the day of departure becomes farther and farther. These people should at least be guilty of the same crime as traitors.

I am abandoning Nanxiang, the enemy is dividing and attacking Huangdu, Qingpu. Our defenses are strict and the enemy dares not advance rashly. The Jiashan station is in a bloody battle.

After our army abandoned Shanghai and moved to a new position, the enemy divided its troops and advanced on three routes. Its main force concentrated on the left wing and attacked our Fengjing Jiashan position fiercely along the Huhang Road. Our army was once forced to retreat, and the enemy advanced to Wangjiangjing. The situation in Jiaxing was extremely tense. The enemy attempted to capture Jiaxing and then spy on our Suzhou via the Sujia Road, cutting off the retreat of our Kunshan Qingpu line of troops. We have seen through their trick and have heavily reinforced our troops to fight a desperate battle with the enemy in Wangjiangjing. Another surprise attack was launched to recover Fengjing and Jiashan behind enemy lines. The enemy launched a counterattack last night. After a night of bloody fighting, as of yesterday noon, both sides were engaged in a mixed battle near Jiashan Station. The siege of Wangjiangjing has been lifted, and Jiaxing can be kept safe. The enemy's plan has been seriously frustrated. The enemy's middle route, on the one hand, spied on Huangdu Anting from Nanxiang, and at the same time advanced towards Qingpu along Qibao Sijing. After we abandoned Sijing, the new position already had solid fortifications. There were skirmishes yesterday morning, but the enemy did not dare to advance rashly. As for the Jiading area, which is the enemy's right wing, the enemy has been on the defensive for half a month, and there has been no fierce fighting on this line. The Jiading garrison had to move slightly backwards to defend the predetermined new position because the terrain was prominent. The enemy will be given a head-on blow if they advance. Yesterday morning, a large number of enemy planes flew over Kunshan, Qingpu, Suzhou, etc., wantonly bombing, and enemy artillery also concentrated on bombing. Our fortifications were slightly damaged.

Enemy troops were extremely busy traveling back and forth between western Shanghai and the Suzhou River in small motorboats. At about 11 am yesterday, the enemy used a small motorboat to tow a barge loaded with military supplies, advancing west along the Suzhou River and heading straight to the enemy front line. Fires have been raging for days. The Nanshi fire is the most intense. The southern city is burning all day long. Houses south of Lujiabang and north of the South Railway Station have all been burned. Even the Catholic charitable organization Xin Puyu Tang was also affected. The Penglai Road Municipal Police Station was also burned down last night. The Minsheng Company warehouse on the Bund in Nanshi was completely burned down. After the Quanzhang Guild Hall was burned down, more than 100 houses inside and outside Xian Gua Street were destroyed. The houses from Dongjiadu to the Hujunying have no complete ones. The enemy's important base is now in the Huashang Tram Company. Yesterday morning, Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, Xiaonanmen, and Zhaojia Road in the city were ablaze, still burning.

Yesterday, more than ten places in Caojiadu, Binbei, Linjiagang, Qujiatai, Wujiahuayuan, and Zhongshan Road Xujiage caught fire. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade in Binnan was unable to go to put out the fire. The fire became more intense until evening. The enemy army set up a headquarters in the Nanshi Local Court. After the enemy army occupied the city and suburbs of Nanshi, it occupied the site of the Shanghai Local Court south of Lishui Bridge as the enemy army headquarters. Yesterday, someone saw enemy soldiers posted at the gate of the court, and many enemy soldiers were also posted at the intersection of the east end, setting up three machine guns and small steel cannons. Enemy ships sailed into the southern Huangpu and set up sentry posts to guard.

Central News Agency reported that after the blockade line in front of the Ten Puning and Shaomatuo Wharf was destroyed by the enemy army, three enemy ships have now sailed into the southern Huangpu and are moored in the area near Gaochang Temple. In addition, an enemy ship is also moored near the blockade line in the Sixteenth Pier.

The Dagong News Agency reported that after the blockade line in the Sixteenth Pier in Nanshi was destroyed by the enemy army, many enemy ships sailed in one after another and went up along the west bank of the Huangpu River. At the same time, the enemy army used motorboats to tow two sand ships full of military supplies into the blockade line and went along the west bank of the Huangpu River from yesterday afternoon. It is reported that the items were transported to the Longhua Airport for storage and standby. In addition, sentry posts were set up and guarded near the blockade line from yesterday afternoon. The miserable situation after the fall of Sijing and Qibao. According to Mr. Zhang, a refugee who escaped from Qibao Town, Qibao Town is densely populated, with rows of shops, and has always been known as a famous town in western Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, the town has gradually fallen into a tragic situation due to the constant bombing by enemy planes. However, the people are content with their homes and rarely escape. Most of the general farmers, businessmen, and merchants still operate day and night and strive to produce as before. However, recently, our army moved from the Shanghai area to a new position for strategic reasons, and the entire town of Qibao was successively occupied, and the tragic situation became even worse. Mr. Zhang could not bear the harassment and planned to risk coming to Shanghai to visit relatives. He specifically invited two companions to travel with him early the day before yesterday, but unexpectedly, they were blocked halfway once. After getting a chance, they traveled alone with light luggage. It took only a short journey of more than ten miles from the town to Xujiahui, but they were strictly inspected by the Japanese army six times. Moreover, the two companions who were blocked the day before yesterday, because they were young and lively, were afraid that their lives were still in danger. As for the tens of thousands of refugees in the town who wanted to stay but could not, and wanted to leave but could not, they lacked food and clothing, and the situation was extremely tragic.

According to a gentleman who escaped from Sijing and came to Shanghai, the vanguard of the enemy army arrived in Sijing Town on the afternoon of the 12th, with about a thousand people. First, our army made a planned retreat, and there were no fierce battles between the two sides. Among the enemy troops, most of them spoke northeastern dialects. After arriving in the town, they went to the countryside in batches to search for village chiefs and ordered them to report military information and local conditions. If they were slightly dissatisfied, they would be whipped. Those who saw strong men in uniform and did not obey their orders would be executed. Those who had a little wealth in the village were also searched, so people were panicked and could not live in peace. This kind of inhuman life made it difficult for people to endure. Young Master Xu returned to China and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Mr. Xu Keyi, the son of Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, returned to China by British ship to attend the funeral. He arrived in Shanghai on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde at 9 am yesterday. Huang Bodu, the secretary of the embassy in Japan, and Lin Xiaogu, etc., went to the ship to greet him. The passing of Nanhui Chuansha. Chuansha has organized a maintenance association. Nanhui has not yet been determined.

Since the enemy army landed in Pudong on the morning of the 11th, its advance troops searched and advanced towards the southeast in separate directions. Therefore, the two counties of Nanchuan and Chuansha along the coast were successively occupied by the enemy. Because the news was blocked, the reporter specifically visited several gentlemen from the two counties who had just escaped from Pudong Tongxiang Association in the afternoon yesterday and recorded what they had learned as follows.

After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the two counties of Nanchuan and Chuansha, with their location on the coast and in the rear, except for Bailonggang in Chuansha, which was once tense, relied on the natural terrain of the seaside beach for resistance, and the effective troops stationed along the coast, coordinated with the local strong men to jointly guard, which was as solid as gold. Although the enemy often sent planes to偵察偵察, and enemy ships also anchored on the sea, repeatedly attempting to spy, they never achieved the purpose of landing. Therefore, for three months, the people in the townships and towns were still able to live and work in peace, without being affected in any way.

The enemy fighting in Shanghai changed its strategy recently because our army's resistance was effective and the front could not develop as expected. They secretly crossed the Jinshan mouth to land and spied on the three counties of Jinshan, Fengxian, and Songjiang. Therefore, Pudong was suddenly threatened, and the troops from Shangnanchuan were withdrawn together on the evening of the 6th. Only local strong men were left in the two counties to defend. Therefore, the traitors hiding in the four villages took the opportunity to move out and became extremely chaotic in the larger towns and cities. The enemy landed on the shore of Pudong on the 11th, and the enemy who窜入奉賢 also had a model of advancing north. Therefore, the county government and various agencies were forced to withdraw, and the strong men in various places also dissolved with pain. Those with a little property in the two counties moved to Shanghai, and the residents were panicked all day long. This was the eve of the fall.

The enemy troops that entered the two counties of Nanchuan and Chuansha were divided into two routes. One went south along Pudong Avenue, directly to Zhoupu and衝入 Nanyi, and the other went along Shangchuan Railway into Chuan from Gaomiao. The enemy from Fengxian also searched north and entered the southern border. The large and small traitors took the opportunity to remove their masks and reveal their true colors, leading the enemy army in separate ways. However, there were not many soldiers on the enemy side, and it was difficult to allocate them to the wide area of Pudong. Therefore, the small towns in the four villages of the two counties were rarely found, and the larger towns fell into the hands of the enemy.

After the two counties were occupied, Zhang Siwei, the former secretary of the Chuansha County Party Department, came out to organize a maintenance association. Zhang had been arrested and imprisoned for smoking opium and almost executed by shooting. He surrendered to the enemy not long after being released from prison in order to seek a way out in the future, so he was despised by the county people early on. Zhang Jigang, a local evil litigant, stole the position of police chief, which was extremely shameless. However, because Zhang was not respected enough by the enemy, they were interested in Chen Yanzhou, the former chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, but Chen had already flown away.

As for Nanhui, the enemy army was also very active, hoping to organize a maintenance association and take over the county government as soon as possible. At first, it was heard that they were interested in Xu Naibing, the director of the Wei Qin Middle School in the county, but Xu did not want to lose his integrity and politely declined on the grounds that he was old and weak. The enemy army had no way, so they changed to invite Tao Caizhang, the principal of the Chenxi Elementary School in the city, to organize. Tao had served as the mayor of Chenxiang Nan town and the director of the Nanyi Folk Education Center, and also had considerable prestige. However, Tao was also an intellectual and had made plans to move to a better place, so a lively drama has not yet been successfully performed. Strange situation in Nanshi. The bandits hiding inside and outside the city and suburbs of Nanshi took advantage of the enemy troops occupying the area and stole copper, tin utensils, clothes, wooden utensils, and other items from the houses of residents who had escaped. Yesterday, they were all selling them at stalls outside Nanyang Bridge and the Sixteenth Pier. The enemy soldiers did not interfere with the stalls set up along the way.

The residents in the city and suburbs of Nanshi had all escaped, and the city became a dead city. The enemy army specifically pasted slogans on the electric poles on Minguo Road and Zhonghua Road yesterday morning. In order to avoid hindering the order in the area and to avoid the refugees rushing forward and causing injuries, they also hoped that all donors would donate the baskets or straw bags containing the food to the association, so that they could be sent out immediately. The association will collect and announce the stage streets, and the quantity of items donated by various input or groups separately.

Sheltering homeless refugees. The refugees in the refugee area, because the shelters were not enough to accommodate them, and those who were lingering on the road and were hungry and cold, were not in the thousands. Father Rao, the director of the relief group of the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Shanghai International Relief Committee, made every effort to provide relief based on humanitarian grounds. In view of this, there is another proposal to increase the establishment of many shelters as much as possible. The location is still in Nanshi, but the location and housing and contact procedures are still in progress. Once agreed, it can be established. In addition, the problems of food and tap water in the Nanshi refugee area have been solved. Candles can be lit in the evening, but the iron gate at the junction of Huafa Kun has not yet been opened, causing people to gather on Minguo Road and enter the small world area in the city to distribute it.

Refugees teach refugees. The 21st shelter of the Municipal Relief Association currently accommodates 1,500 refugees. Recently, with the fall of southern Shanghai, the refugees in the shelter are all concerned about the homelessness of their compatriots, and they gathered to discuss and decided to allocate eight bags of noodle powder that they had saved for three consecutive days to the General Association for distribution by the International Relief Committee. It is worthy of praise during this national crisis. The refugee area is maintained by merchants organized by residents. The police have no choice but to retreat. The drinking water problem has been solved.

Central News Agency reported that the Nanshi refugee area, which is presided over by the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, was originally guarded by our police. Since the fall of Nanshi, our police have had no choice but to withdraw. The refugees are now living in the area with the merchants who are automatically organizing business groups and taking on the responsibility of guarding. As for the tap water, they have also asked the Japanese army to issue a pass so that they can send workers to repair it. This is not only to solve the drinking water for the residents in the area, but also to extinguish the remnants of the炮火. The food problem is being handled by the relief group of the association and the International Relief Committee. Items donated by all parties are collected at the International Relief Committee on the third floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association and transported to the area for distribution every morning at 8 am and 2:30 pm. There is a large fire east of the old North Gate in the area. The fire is very fierce, and the flames can be seen on the tall buildings. There are two other places where the embers have not been extinguished, and the red light is still all over the sky. The martial law in the concession will not be lifted in the short term.

The Continental Daily reported that regarding the issue of martial law in the concession, someone asked the police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession yesterday. According to the police authorities, although the Shanghai war has stopped, martial law in the Public Concession and the French Concession will continue for a certain period of time, one week or two weeks undecided. The police department said that the difficulty has not been lifted due to the cessation of the war. Many bad elements and thieves with weapons, as well as other people who like to do evil, maintaining martial law at present can at least鎮壓 those people. The Times reported that due to the gradual return of the situation to normal, the British troops on the border of the Shanghai Public Concession have been greatly reduced since yesterday. It is reported that the number of British troops along the border of the concession has been reduced by at least half. Except for some of the most important sentry posts, the others have been abandoned. It is learned from the responsible parties that there is no problem in withdrawing all British troops at present, but there are still some inspection works that are needed, so we must wait for the situation to return to normal. Enemy ships attempt to disturb the interior of Guangdong. Repeatedly send enemy planes to disturb the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the West River and infiltrate the South Road to incite bandits.

Guangzhou Communication: Enemy planes flew to the various stations of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, such as Zhangmutou, Tangtouxia, Shigu, Lincun, and Hengli, on the 1st and 2nd of this month, and dropped bombs to bomb the local tracks, and destroyed dozens of civilian houses, killing and injuring dozens of farmers. On the 3rd, four enemy planes took off from the enemy aircraft carrier in Tangjiawan. When they passed Humen at 7:40 am, they observed for a long time, and then flew to the various stations of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, such as Tiantangwei, Shigu, and Tangtouxia, and dropped six or seven bombs, destroying more than ten zhang of the roadbed. At 2:30 pm, the enemy sent three more planes to drop eight bombs between Pinghu and Tiantangtuan, destroying more than a dozen zhang of the tracks. It was found that the enemy planes came from enemy aircraft carriers, and the bombs they dropped were not as large as those dropped by bombers. The bomb craters were only about one zhang in damage, indicating that the bombing power was very weak. In addition to sending planes to bomb the transportation hubs of Guangdong and Hong Kong, the enemy has recently attempted to harass the interior of Guangdong Province. On the West River side, the enemy sent planes to Zhaoqing in the middle of last month, two the first time and five the second time, all hovering and detecting at an altitude of more than 5,000 feet, but did not drop bombs. On the Guangdong South side, because the land is close to the sea, the enemy has been spying for a long time. Therefore, enemy ships outside the Humen Port have recently sailed to Taishan, Guanghai, Chixi, Yamen, Qiongya, and other areas to control the coast of southern China. At present, there are several enemy cruisers on the sea off Guanghai and Chixi. There is an enemy aircraft ◻ No. 19 fleet cruiser in Zhongshan Tangjiawan, and two other destroyers. There is a 松風 boat in Haikou, Qiongzhou, a No. 26 destroyer, and another cruiser. There are two enemy ships in Sanya Port, Yaxian, and two enemy ships in Zhichang Qinglan Port. The enemy ships in front of the Qiongya sea have increased to seven. Every night, they

Our troops abandoned Taicang, holding Qingyang Port, confronting each other across the river. Enemy troops planned to land at Liuhe and Baimaokou, attempting a flanking maneuver to encircle and capture Suzhou. Dozens of enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed Kunshan, causing a major fire. For days, the enemy's main force concentrated on the left flank, fiercely attacking Fengjing and Jiashan, then veering towards Wangjiangjing, attempting to cut off the connection between the Sujia Road. However, our troops have been closely blocking and intercepting them, and reinforcements are arriving continuously for combat. Fierce battles are unfolding near Wangjiangjing, and the stubborn enemy has been surrounded. As for the enemy's right flank, after our Jiading garrison voluntarily moved to a new defensive position, the enemy actively reorganized and deployed their forces. Simultaneously, over seventy enemy warships gathered at Liuhe and Baimaokou, using dense artillery fire to bombard our positions day and night. Our fortifications were destroyed. To avoid excessive casualties, we were forced to retreat slightly. Yesterday morning, under the cover of artillery fire, a large number of enemy troops landed at various ports, with a strength estimated at over one division. Villages near Hengjing, Luhe Town, Guijiazhuang, Hejiashi, and other places were all devastated. Enemy cavalry charged into Zhitang, probing towards Taicang along the highway. Another route attacked from Liuhe Luduqiao. Our Taicang garrison had already built extremely strong fortifications and calmly responded to the battle. The enemy launched several fierce attacks, all of which were repelled. Yesterday morning, both sides engaged in fierce fighting, with constant artillery fire. The enemy left corpses strewn across the field, repeatedly retreating and advancing. Our troops, with the first line of fortifications breached by the enemy, had no choice but to retreat with heavy hearts, joining forces with the Jiading garrison to firmly defend the line of Waigang, Tianfu'an, and Pengwen Town. The enemy's large-scale landing on the right flank clearly indicates a strategy of large-scale flanking maneuvers from the left and right to pressure the Suzhou-Kunshan line. From last night onwards, dozens of enemy heavy artillery pieces concentrated their fire on our positions in Waigang and other places. Enemy infantry, numbering about one brigade, along with forty or so tanks, also launched large-scale attacks along multiple routes. The two armies engaged in hand-to-hand combat. For strategic reasons, we were ordered this morning to shift our defense to the Qingyang Port line, with both sides confronting each other across the river. Heavy artillery fire and machine gun fire could be clearly heard within Kunshan city. Our forces are strong on this line, and everything has been fully prepared, enough to fight the enemy. The enemy's propaganda this afternoon claiming to have captured Kunshan is absolutely untrue. Moreover, over thirty enemy aircraft flew towards Kunshan, Suzhou, and the Suzhou-Jiaxing railway, highway, and waterway lines this morning, indiscriminately bombing, attempting to damage our transportation and supplies. Major fires broke out in Suzhou, Kunshan, and Jiaxing, with extremely tragic burning of civilian houses, but the damage to our military fortifications and transportation supplies is still light. Our troops firmly hold Qingyang Port. Yesterday, enemy troops landed at Baimaokou. Our troops in Taicang retreated slightly. After our troops abandoned Nanxiang and Jiading, the enemy, in order to threaten our rear, gathered a large number of enemy warships on the sea off Nantong and Haimen, totaling about fifty or sixty vessels. The night before last, enemy warships first used artillery fire to fiercely bombard the Jiang'an area of Liuhe, Baimaokou, and Hupu. Our garrison had long been prepared and calmly responded to the battle, but due to the enemy warships' extremely fierce artillery fire, which bombarded densely throughout the night, our Jiang'an fortifications suffered some damage. To avoid excessive sacrifices, we retreated slightly, and the enemy took the opportunity to land successively at Baimaokou under the cover of artillery fire. Our troops rose up to meet them, blocking them strictly. The enemy troops then fled southward, and villages such as Hengjing and Guijiazhuang were successively invaded by them. Later, they fled south to Zhitang, probing towards our Taicang along the highway. At the same time, the enemy troops in Liuhe also attacked southwest. Our troops in Taicang have extremely strong fortifications. After a day and night of bloody fighting, our troops held firm and did not retreat, fighting bravely with redoubled efforts, killing countless enemies. Finally, because the Taicang position was too prominent, we retreated with heavy hearts, joining forces with the troops in the Nanxiang area of Jiading, firmly defending the line of Tianfu'an Lujiabang, confronting the enemy across Qingyang Port. The iron bridge had long been bombed and destroyed by enemy aircraft. The Qingyang Port river surface is vast, and our troops' fortifications along the river are strong, making it difficult for enemy troops to cross. This morning, a large number of enemy aircraft were wantonly bombing the Kunshan area, and enemy artillery was fiercely bombarding our Kunshan positions, but the damage was minimal. Our right-wing battles, since the enemy troops attempted to attack our Sujia Railway, were defeated by our troops near Wangjiangjing Station on the Sujia Highway. At the moment, the two armies are still holding each other east of Jiashan Station. The enemy in Songjiang is attempting to invade the Sujia Railway by waterway, and our troops are closely monitoring the situation. Major Fires Again in Various Parts of Pudong. The enemy troops occupying Pudong, after declaring martial law the day before yesterday, continued to cause fires in various places. At around 9:00 PM last night, the flames south of Laobaidu Street soared into the sky, illuminating the area as if it were daytime. The burning continued past midnight, and the embers had not yet been extinguished. A total of four to five hundred civilian houses were destroyed. At around 8:00 AM this morning, the most prosperous area of Laiyidu Street, south of Diandang Lane, to the police station intersection, also caught fire and burned. The thick smoke covered the sky, and the scene was extremely tragic. The fire gradually subsided only at noon, and seventy or eighty market houses were destroyed. The enemy troops announced yesterday morning that residents could only cross to Puxi, and anyone returning would be killed without exception. There was also a batch of corpses that were tossed into the Huangpu River at the Xin Sanjing Wharf. Yesterday evening, three bodies, male and female, were discovered floating with the tide to the Xinkai River surface: one was a member of the defense corps, with his uniform and bullet belt still on; the other two were a female girl scout and a young girl in a cheongsam, with many knife wounds on their bodies. Eight Enemy Warships Sail into Southern Huangpu. After the blockade line on the Southern Huangpu River was broken, the number of shallow-draft gunboats that the enemy sailed in reached eight, directly reaching the upper reaches of Minhang and Songjiang, assisting in combat. Yesterday, four or five ships had already sailed out and confiscated eleven civilian tugs and small ferries (commonly known as "disappearing brand" ferries) that were blockaded in the Southern Huangpu River, replacing them with enemy flags and forcing them to sail out of the blockade line, detaining them in the Huishan Wharf area for the enemy to use. Over 10,000 Enemy Reinforcements Continue to Arrive. According to the Central News Agency, from yesterday morning (the 14th) to this afternoon (the 15th), a total of eleven enemy transport ships successively sailed into Shanghai: the transport ship Chikugo Maru, which was converted from an enemy merchant ship; the 172nd transport ship Naples Maru; the 82nd transport ship Shuki Maru; the 204th transport ship Shokokumaru; the 310th transport ship Iwatesan Maru; the 10th transport ship Venezia Maru; the 185th transport ship Woyo Maru; the 151st transport ship Sumida Maru; the 184th transport ship Padon Maru; and the Chojyu Maru, as well as the transport ship Mamiya. They berthed at the China Merchants Bureau North Bund, Huishan, Osaka, Huangpu, and Qiujiang wharves. In addition to carrying the sixth batch of the enemy's seventh reinforcements, approximately 10,000 troops, they also brought a large number of enemy heavy weapons, such as armored vehicles, tanks, heavy artillery, and other military supplies, which were unloaded and landed. Enemy Aircraft Attack Jiaxing Four Times. According to a Central News Agency report from Hangzhou on the 14th, enemy aircraft, totaling six in number, attacked Jiaxing in four waves yesterday. Eight bombs were dropped on Beida Street, destroying over twenty civilian houses. One incendiary bomb was dropped, destroying four or five houses. Two bombs were dropped on the Catholic Church, destroying six houses. Three bombs landed on the children's playground, causing no damage. Those Fleeing to Shanghai Describe the Failure in Southern Pudong. Enemy Constructs Fortifications on Sijiao, Attempting to Use It as a Base to Spy on Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since the enemy landed at Jinshanwei, the coastal areas of southern Pudong have fallen one after another. News from all sides is like entering a sealed gourd, making it difficult to know the details. According to a report from a Mr. Wang, an old steward of a soy sauce shop in Nanhuixin Town who fled to Shanghai, he and another person came out on the afternoon of the 11th. Although there was no sign of the enemy at that time, everyone was panicked and had already fled. Local ruffians took the opportunity to rob, obstructing the roads. They rested in Datuan and Zhoupu, and arrived at Beicai. The next morning (the 12th), they encountered six or seven enemy soldiers who ordered them to be interrogated. At the same time, many people also arrived from Zhagang along the Southern Huangpu River from Nanqiao. It is said that before the enemy troops arrived, local ruffians robbed door-to-door. After the enemy troops arrived, they formed a group to escape. Twenty-one bombs were dropped on Fengcheng, turning it into scorched earth. Jinhuqiao and other places farther from the sea suffered less damage. As for Caojing and Zhalin, which are close to the coast, a farmer named Yang Heshang said yesterday that he arrived in Shanghai on the 7th, two days after the enemy ships landed, taking the Red Cross vehicle from Zhangze, Shanyang, passing through Mishidu. According to him, the enemy took advantage of our army's troop deployment at 4:00 AM on the 4th, using hundreds of fishing boats equipped with machine guns. The first dozens of boats were all fishermen, and the enemy was hiding in the cabins. In the wind and fog, they landed from the shores of Jinshanwei and Jinshan Mouth, both north and south. Although the shore is iron-sand, fishing boats occasionally dock there on weekdays, but there is very little traffic. The enemy forced people to guide them, and they surged up. The left wing attacked Jijing from Jinshanwei, and a certain division rushed to resist, fighting for two hours before retreating. Later, a certain regiment came from Pubin to reinforce and attacked together, intercepting the enemy in Tinglin and other places. The right wing went straight from Jinshanwei to Zhangyan and arrived at Songyin, approaching Mishidu. Before he left, he saw shallow-water steamships parked in the Jinshanwei and Jinshan Mouth area, and transport ships were busy. Outside Jinshanmen, opposite Jinshan Mouth, there were originally twenty-six enemy warships berthed, which had successively sailed towards Hangzhou Bay and Zhapu. Two months ago, Chenshan (i.e., Jinshan) and Sijiao Mountain, about three or four hundred miles from Jinshan Mouth, were occupied by the enemy and had built wharves, highways, and airfields. Recently, aircraft bombing the coastal borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang all took off from here. Tanhushan and Xiaowangpan Island (about a hundred miles from Jinshan Mouth) also have military facilities, and hundreds of large fishing boats that have been seized are moored nearby for the enemy to transport supplies. The enemy has made this place an important base for attacking Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Jiangzhe rebellion of the Ming Jiajing era also took this route. Unexpectedly, more than three hundred years later, they are still copying the old articles, spying on our hinterland. It is painful to say. As for the nearby towns, such as Jin Siniang Bridge, Jiangzhuang, Shanyang, Tinglin, and Yepu, such as Yexie and Zhangze, there was a battle, and there was a lot of destruction. When he escaped, he was often in danger. He encountered an enemy plainclothes team near Zhangze. After the interrogation, they found no suspicion and gave him a Japanese pass written in ink on a white paper strip before he was spared, but he was still charged before crossing the ferry. Enemy Troops Active in Pudong Yesterday. According to Dagongshe, people coming from Yangshupu said that from 4:00 AM to 5:30 AM this morning, three enemy warships sailed out of the Huangpu River and turned towards the Yangtze River basin. In addition, it was heard that a batch of enemy troops (number unknown) landed at the Sanjing Wharf in Pudong last night. Burning and Looting in Nanshi. Charity Organizations and Schools Reduced to Ashes. The fire in Nanshi has occurred in more than a dozen places so far, especially the general burning outside Datongmen is the most severe. This area is mainly composed of medicinal material stores, soybean and wheat stores, and chicken and duck stores. It is currently burning south from Dada Wharf Street. The fire stretching from Xieqiao straight to Haichao Temple covers the widest area, measuring three miles in length. This area, from west to east, includes Lujiabang Road, and Lin'yin Road, Daji Road, Huangjiaque Road, Tianlin Road, Jiangyin Street, Dafochang, Sangyuan Street, etc., all of which were destroyed. To the right, in the southern section of Zhonghua Road, Qingxin Boys' Middle School and the Qingxin Church of the Presbyterian Church, as well as the Tongren Fuyuan Tang soup kitchen, were also looted. No fewer than twenty elementary schools in that section were burned. The fire is spreading towards the East Bookstore area. Furthermore, the fire on Sanpailou is currently spreading east towards Caiyi Street and Zhaojiabang Road. It is expected that it will connect with the fire south of Dada Wharf by noon today. The fire at the Penglai Road Municipal Police Station has been burning southwest. The Penglai Market is burning this morning. The fire in the eastern section of Wenmiao Road is scorching the Public Education Center and the Municipal Zoo. The Xicheng Elementary School with a long history, as well as the Quchiawan Zhu's Sijing Garden Ancestral Hall, were also burned down. The fire at Tangjiawan Houliliyuan Road Bureaumen Road is still burning fiercely. All the prosperous areas of Nanshi have been reduced to ashes. However, although Fuyou Road and Chuanjia Street in the city have not been burned by fire, all the residents' properties have been looted by traitors. The French Concession Strives to Maintain Order. Since the outbreak of the war in Nanshi on the 11th, a large number of refugees have entered the French Concession to take refuge, and order has inevitably become somewhat chaotic. Therefore, the authorities of the French Concession, for the sake of overall consideration, in addition to dispatching more patrol police to guard the main thoroughfares, also dispatched five tanks and several armored vehicles yesterday to maintain strict vigilance in important areas to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble and to ensure the security of the concession. Safety Issues in the Concession. According to a Reuter's dispatch from London on the 13th, there is naturally much speculation about the future status of Shanghai, but at the current stage, the authorities show no desire to explore the issue. The attempt to decide on the conditions under which this matter can be discussed is still premature. With the Japanese army winning victories around Shanghai, the safety of the French Concession and the International Settlement during the Japanese military occupation of the neighboring Chinese territories has become an urgent issue. The American, British, and French representatives at the Brussels Conference discussed this matter without any panic. Everyone felt that the contact between the local foreign authorities and the Japanese authorities would be sufficient to develop the necessary ways of life. London is extremely confident that the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Philip, has the ability to consult with the Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, Liddell, and the British Army Commander-in-Chief, Sima Lai, to protect British interests. Especially since the British representative in China, Ho Wu, recently visited Shanghai, it is said that he strongly assisted Philip in successfully establishing satisfactory contact with the Shanghai Japanese military and civilian authorities, which greatly improved the overall situation. Enemy Troops Inspect the Postal Bureau This Morning. Representatives from the Municipal Council Accompanied Them. They Withdrew, and the Bureau Resumed Normal Operations. At 8:30 AM today, more than a dozen enemy soldiers, accompanied by three senior police officers from the Shanghai Municipal Council (one British, one Chinese, and one Japanese), inspected the Shanghai Postal Bureau on North Sichuan Road. They left after half an hour, and all the staff in the bureau continued to operate as usual. However, there were few pedestrians in the vicinity of the bureau, and the scene was extremely bleak. Customs Continues to Exercise Its Powers. All Tax Revenues Are Paid to the Central Government. After our troops withdrew from Shanghai, the enemy commander Matsui declared that he would interfere with the administration of the Jianghai Customs if necessary. The reporter specifically inquired about the truth from the customs. It is understood that the customs is still exercising its powers as usual and is not affected in any way. The tax revenue collected is still transferred to HSBC for transfer to the central government as usual. However, both import and export taxes have decreased significantly, and transit taxes have also decreased sharply due to the interruption of railway and inland waterway transportation. Lianyungang Enemy Warships Bombard Dongxi Liandao. Our Garrison Returns Fire. Enemy Warships Bombard Wutong. According to a telecommunications report from Lianyungang [Xuzhou], after the enemy warships attacked our port yesterday morning and were driven away, they returned in the evening and fired more than forty shells at our Dongxi Liandao, and used aircraft for cover. Our garrison returned fire, and the battle stopped after two hours. The enemy warships have not yet left the sea (special dispatch on the 14th). According to a Central News Agency report from [Xiamen] on the 14th, at around 10:00 AM on the 14th, two enemy warships sailed in from Kinmen and fired more than twenty shells at Wutong, causing little damage. Jiangxi People Implement Eight Creeds. According to a Central News Agency report from [Nanchang], the people of various counties in Jiangxi Province are working hard to concentrate manpower and material resources to contribute to the country and nation in order to increase the strength of resistance, and they hold a common and consistent spirit and attitude, implementing the following eight creeds: 1. Have the belief that victory is certain; 2. Have the determination to sacrifice; 3. Have strict discipline; 4. Have cooperative behavior; 5. Have creative ability; 6. Have the habit of patience; 7. Have enthusiastic emotions; 8. Have a self-reflective attitude (Central News Agency, 14th). Enemy Will Abolish Chinese Language in Kinmen. According to reports from [Xiamen], the enemy announced in Kinmen that they would abolish the Chinese language and establish Japanese schools in the short term, and children aged six to eight must attend school (special dispatch on the 14th). Britain and the Netherlands Conclude a Defense Agreement. Protecting Interests in the Far East. According to a Reuter's dispatch from [London], the "Times Weekly" today confirmed the rumors that Britain and the Netherlands are conducting military negotiations to protect the interests of both countries in the Far East, saying that the negotiations were conducted by naval experts from Britain and the Netherlands. An agreement has been concluded on the defense of the Dutch East Indies. The newspaper continued that Britain attaches great importance to protecting the transportation between Singapore and Australia and is making every effort to prevent this transportation from falling into the hands of an enemy country (Haitong Telegraph, 14th). Prospects for British Diplomacy. Will Talk with Italy and Germany Separately. British Prime Minister Scheduled to Visit Berlin. According to [Rome], the "Stampa" newspaper recently commented on the matter that Britain will conduct talks with Italy and Germany separately, saying that 'British Prime Minister Chamberlain seems to have made up his mind to move forward this time without hesitating and looking back. This is not only based on good intentions, but also because the endings of the Sino-Japanese dispute and the Spanish civil war have become clear. The policies pursued by Britain in the past have failed to adapt to the real situation. Although the signs of change have only appeared today, it is not too late. As for France, it has felt anger and resentment in addition to surprise.' (Central News Agency Reuter, 14th) According to [London], it is heard that Privy Councilor Halifax will set out for Germany on November 17. This is the result of discussions between British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Halifax (Central News Agency Reuter, 15th). According to [Berlin], foreign newspapers have made many speculations about the future peace talks between German leader Hitler and British Privy Councilor Halifax. Today, the German newspapers specially published an article from the press agency of the National Socialist Party to refute it. The newspapers mostly say that Britain is willing to make peace with Germany, but none of the newspapers mentioned what Britain and Germany will talk about. According to the press agency of the National Socialist Party, the German people know the opinions of London and Paris on colonial matters and will wait for new developments. As for the claim that Germany wants to contact Western European countries in order to establish a four-country negotiation, the press agency said that there are no disputes between Germany and these countries, and Germany does not want to cover up the obviously shameful failure of the recently concluded great power conference (probably referring to the Beijing Conference) with a new international conference. (Central News Agency Reuter, 14th) Brazil Conducts Anti-Communist Movement. But Not Interested in Anti-Comintern Pact. According to the capital of Brazil, Brazilian President Vargas recently declared to foreign journalists that 'our constitutional government is not a fascist system, but Brazil's own constitutional government. Brazil is not interested in the Anti-Comintern Pact. Brazil is concerned with Pan-American policies.' He also said that the foreign debt issue will be studied soon, and Brazil will give priority to countries that enjoy a trade surplus, such as the United States. At the same time, the Brazilian cabinet has decided to conduct an anti-communist movement (Central News Agency Reuter, 14th). United States Conducts First Unemployment Survey. The President Hopes for People's Cooperation. According to [Washington], President Roosevelt announced in a radio broadcast in the evening that a survey will be conducted on the 16th of this month to determine the number of unemployed people in the country. This will be the first time that a truthful and thorough investigation will be conducted on the total number of unemployed people in the United States, and he hopes that the people will cooperate sincerely. On that day, postmen across the country will distribute survey forms to each household. All those who are completely unemployed and those who only have partial work should fill in their names. The President also said that the unemployment problem cannot be solved by subsidies alone, and the agricultural and industrial sectors should employ as many workers as possible. In private industry, they should cooperate fully with the government to be effective. Moreover, the unemployment problem is not unique to the United States, and other countries around the world are suffering from it. Some countries have used large-scale expansion of armaments to solve it, but the United States does not want to adopt this method. According to the American Federation of Labor, there are a total of eight million unemployed people in the country, and there are as many as 800,000 in New York alone (Central News Agency Havas, 14th). Former Romanian Prime Minister Ordered to Form Cabinet. According to the capital of Romania, after Prime Minister Tătărescu (leader of the Liberal Party) resigned, National Peasant Party leader Mihalache was ordered to form a cabinet but failed. King Carol II has now instructed Tătărescu to continue to form a cabinet, and it is generally believed that Tătărescu can complete the task quickly. In addition, Liberal Party splinter leader Brătianu had previously sought the post of foreign minister as a condition for joining the cabinet, but he may now accept a secondary cabinet post and cooperate with Tătărescu. (According to reports, Brătianu broke away from the Liberal Party in 1930 and leaned towards the extreme right-wing nationalist party.) Liberal Party executives also believe that if Tătărescu's new cabinet can obtain the cooperation of the splinter party, it will be able to win a majority of seats in the general election in the future (Central News Agency Waus, 14th). Traitors Commit Evil Deeds. The People of Nanshi Suffer Terribly. Young Men Are Especially Miserable. After the fall of Nanshi, the local terror is getting worse and worse. Most of the foreign ruffians have become traitors, acting as accomplices. In recent days, led by a traitor named Chen, they have been leading looting. After robbing, they set it on fire. Last night, the Fu'an Company outside Xiaodongmen was looted, and then set on fire. Looking from the concession, the place where the fire was raging in Nanshi was Fu'an being burned. The section of Xiaonanmen Street was extremely fiery and irreparably destroyed. According to refugees who escaped from the area near the South Railway Station and Dongjiadu, young men who have not escaped are being slaughtered every day, and corpses are lying all over the ground. The Shanghai Local Court has now become the general organ of traitors. It is said that there are traitors posting notices in front of the court, with huge notices stating that someone is filling a certain factory. The doors of each residence have been destroyed, and high-quality equipment has been moved away. The inferior equipment was split into firewood. The areas of Wangjia Wharf and Dongjiadu have been turned into scorched earth. The reporter witnessed many young men in Nanshi being forced to do hard labor in Laoximen and Heping Road. If they were not satisfied, they would be whipped. The traitors' shouts and scoldings to their compatriots were particularly shameful. At the same time, armored vehicles of the enemy troops were parading and demonstrating around the refugee areas all day long, so the refugees were in a state of panic. Members of the Protection Corps Suffer Harm. Yesterday afternoon, more than twenty members of the Protection Corps were distributing supplies to refugees along the Minguo Road area in Nanshi when they were spotted by traitors. Seven members of the corps were arrested, and the rest took the opportunity to retreat. Later, the seven who were arrested were brutally shot in front of the iron wire fence at the entrance of Guangfu Temple on Fangbang Road in the city. The Guangdong Fellow Association Tries to Send Refugees Back to Their Hometowns. The Number of Fellow Refugees Escaping Is Increasing. After Registering, They Will Be Sent Back Separately. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association has been actively carrying out the work of sheltering fellow refugees. A total of more than 20,000 people have been sheltered before and after. In addition to those sent back to their hometowns, there are more than 8,000 people who are separately sheltered in the New World, New New Roof Garden, and Qingliang Temple. Because many fellow villagers in Nanshi have fled into the concession, the number of refugees has increased by hundreds. For the sake of fundamental relief, a registration office for fellow refugees returning to their hometowns has been specially set up. It is heard that after the registration procedures are completed, Taikoo vessels will be chartered and sent back to their hometowns on a regular basis. A Tragic Scene in the Midst of Escape. Looking at Each Other, Stunned Like Wooden Chickens. Grief Came From the Heart, and They Cried Loudly. A refugee who had just managed to escape from Nanshi yesterday said that at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, an old woman with a northern accent, about sixty years old, was wandering near a certain iron shed on Minguo Road, hoping to climb into the concession, but at that time, several enemy soldiers happened to be patrolling here. Among them, a puppet Manchurian soldier stepped forward and dragged the old woman to the ground, preventing her from climbing. The old woman was extremely frightened by the sight and knelt on the ground to beg for mercy. The scene was pitiful. Unexpectedly, the enemy soldier looked at the refugee woman for a long time, and suddenly showed a surprised look. The two looked at each other, stunned like wooden chickens, and remained silent. After being scolded by the rest of the enemy soldiers, they turned around and left. At this point, the refugee woman suddenly felt grief from the heart and cried loudly. At that time, there were quite a few onlookers, all of whom did not know what was going on and were surprised. After the enemy soldiers left, they began to inquire. According to the old woman, she was from Northeast China, and the enemy soldier just now was her nephew. After the fall of the Northeast, he was conscripted into the enemy army. This time, he unexpectedly came to Shanghai and met here. She did not know whether to be sad or happy. Her tears and nose were still flowing. All the audience felt sad for it. Brief Commentary. According to the victims who took refuge in Shanghai from Punan and Songjiang, they described the situation of the people being displaced and looted by bandits. Looking at the hundreds of thousands of people under the iron wire fence of the French Concession, living in a cycle of hell, I can't help but feel heartbroken. This determination to resist and preparation for sacrifice are certainly appropriate and arise from the people's own will. Therefore, on the one hand, we must prepare for sacrifice, and on the other hand, we should have a plan to preserve the sacrifice. Even if we cannot preserve the sacrifice, we should at least try to reduce the sacrifice. We must not make this unnecessary sacrifice because the people are prepared to sacrifice. The sacrifice that should not be sacrificed should not be sacrificed. I believe that the city's determination to hold on and the enemy's landing at Jinshanwei are not only a waste of our people, but also a major mistake in military terms. Our Army Defends the North Bank of the Jinpu Line. Our Army in Daming Retreats to the Southeast. According to [Nanjing], the Chinese army is now fighting to the death to defend the north bank of the Yellow River to prevent the Japanese army from peeping into Jinan. The Chinese army in the Jinpu Railway area is located near Yancheng, ten miles from the north bank of the Yellow River in the middle, near Jiyang on the right wing, and near Qihe on the left wing. The Chinese army in Daming has retreated to a certain location in the southeast of the city. Japanese aircraft have heavily bombed the Yellow River crossings (Central News Agency Reuter, 15th).

Father Jacquinot Discusses Expanding Refugee Area. Tap Water Connected Yesterday. Many People From All Walks of Life Sent Food. According to the Times, it was learned last night that Father Jacquinot, who is in charge of the Nanshi refugee area, has discussed with the Japanese military authorities to expand the safe area for refugees, because the area currently feels crowded and cramped. Japanese soldiers patrol the streets in the area twice a day, and no accidents have occurred. When the Japanese soldiers pass by, residents avoid going out. The food and water problem has been satisfactorily resolved by the authorities in charge. Food sent daily by Buddhist associations, world peace associations, international Red Cross societies and other charitable organizations to the border of the French Concession is sufficient to supply these 100,000 refugees. Wounded refugees can be transported into the French Concession and immediately sent to hospitals for treatment. It is understood that there are many wounded and sick in the safe area. The iron gates along the French Concession are not as crowded as in the past few days. Men, women and children do not insist on entering the concession. Red Cross staff distribute light biscuits, bread and cooked tea near the iron gates. From yesterday, it is no longer allowed to throw food arbitrarily outside the iron gate. Food sent by individuals or organizations must first be concentrated in one place, and then sent to the safe area for distribution. It is said that there are bad elements mixed in the safe area. Many men and children get a lot of food and store it in bags, and then carry it away from the border of the concession and sell it to other places at a price of ten to fifteen copper coins per cake or bread. Most elderly men and women cannot get food at the gate all day long, so they have to buy it from these looters. According to the results of an inspection by a neutral observer, it was found that many refugees in the safe area have become hungry and exhausted, and they do not know that food is being distributed near the border of the concession. Yesterday, tap water was connected to the French Concession, and refugees can take water twice a day with their washbasins, water bottles, and buckets. In the next few days, water, electricity, and telephones are expected to be connected. Father Jacquinot and other committee members toured the various places yesterday. Shanghai Food Problem. Rice Boats in Nanshi Are Being Negotiated to Be Released. The Municipal Council Has Ordered Saigon Rice to Regulate. Wheat Flour Stock Is Sufficient, and There Is No Worry About People's Food. At this time of tight situation and traffic obstruction, although various food groups have tried to regulate it, the current food for the citizens is quite important and relies entirely on foreign rice. The Municipal Council has ordered a large amount of Saigon rice, and the rice boats in Nanshi have been negotiated to unload. The details are as follows: Rice Boats in Nanshi Are Being Negotiated to Unload. The reporter learned from the miscellaneous grain industry yesterday that rice boats from the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are docked at the Nanshi bean and rice industry wharf, totaling about 20,000 stones. Since Nanshi became a war zone, it has been impossible to unload the goods. Miscellaneous grain, oil cake industry, bean and rice industry, rice shop industry, and rice grain industry associations have tried to unload the goods and mix with the food for the citizens of Shanghai. It is heard that the concession authorities have also tried to negotiate for release. After the negotiation is properly done, the goods can be unloaded. The Food for the Citizens of Shanghai Relies Entirely on Foreign Rice. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, considering that Wuhu is a rice-producing area in our country, and now the British shipping companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson are opening the Shanghai-Nantong line, and the Yangtze River ships are connected to each other, specially ordered various food groups to purchase food to maintain the food for the citizens of Shanghai. However, according to Gu Xinyi, the leader of the miscellaneous food industry, it is quite difficult in fact. Currently, the food for the people of Shanghai relies entirely on foreign rice. Moreover, Chinese businessmen do not dare to order foreign rice from abroad, because 1. It is too dangerous to load and transport to Shanghai, and 2. The price is not cost-effective after levying import tax. The Municipal Council Regulates Foreign Rice. In order to regulate the food for the people, the Public Concession Municipal Council will sell its stock of food to rice shops at a parity price, and at the same time order a large amount of Saigon rice from abroad to be shipped to Shanghai in batches. Each bag of this Saigon rice weighs 210 pounds, which is equivalent to 198市斤. The Municipal Council sells it for about 17 yuan and 5 cents of national currency, including transportation costs, etc. Each bag is calculated at 125 斗, and each stone is about 14 yuan. The retail price of each rice shop is 9 yuan of national currency per 100市斤. Sufficient Powdered Wheat, No Worry About People's Food. As for the current lack of miscellaneous food in Shanghai, rice shops have sold out their stocks and have been suspended from business for the time being. Although the Municipal Council has sold its stock of rice to rice shops at a parity price, it is still not enough to distribute due to the fact that demand is greater than supply in the market. However, the total amount of wheat stored in Shanghai is about 1 million bags, and the amount of flour is about 400,000 bags. At the same time, the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills are rushing to produce, so the food for the entire city of Shanghai can still be maintained. Moreover, the feeding of various refugee shelters belonging to the Shanghai branch of the Refugee Relief Committee during extraordinary times has been changed to flour. A Large Number of Thieves Arrested in the Public Concession. Detained for Investigation and Waiting for Interrogation. In the past few days, the Public Concession Police Force has carried out a major arrest of thieves, and has captured more than 30 men and women, and seized a lot of military fire. The details of the party are as follows: 1. The Chengdu Road Police Station detected that thieves were hiding in Room 28 of the Leming Hotel on Shanxi Road, and often arrested Xu Hongyu, Song San, Hai Gen, Hu Jinsheng, Zhang Asi, Yao Fusheng and other six people, and seized two pistols and six

### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Discusses Declaration, Condemning Japan in Strong Terms

Eleven Nations Have Agreed, Only Italy Slightly Dissents; Passage Expected Today, Still Hoping Japan Will Withdraw from the Brink

Brussels – The declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which strongly condemns Japan, will be passed at tomorrow afternoon's meeting. The original text will only be slightly modified. Italy will not vote against it, but will abstain. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was unable to pass the draft declaration today due to strong opposition from the Italian representative, which severely criticized Japan's refusal to attend the meeting. After lengthy and heated discussions, the representatives decided to submit the draft declaration to their respective governments for review. The declaration states that if Japan continues to refuse to participate in talks, the nations must consider and decide on a common stance. It is now scheduled to reconvene next Monday at 4 PM to finalize the declaration, with amendments allowed before the vote.

Italian representative Macchi stated today when opposing the declaration that the Italian government needs sufficient time to consider the draft declaration and should ask the Japanese government to explain what it meant in its reply by asking the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to make practical contributions suitable to the current situation. Chinese chief representative Wellington Koo opposed this motion, saying that the conference urgently needs to proceed with its work and should not be delayed further. Representatives from the US, France, Britain, and Canada also disagreed with asking Japan for further explanation. Representatives from Portugal, Mexico, and Australia then expressed their support for the declaration. The Dutch representative also agreed, but with some amendments, which were purely stylistic. The Portuguese representative fully endorsed the declaration, calling it a very insightful document. Australian representative Bruce delivered a lengthy speech defending the democratic system and praising US chief representative Davis. After the Australian representative spoke, the conference discussed the declaration item by item, concluding at 6:30 PM. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak then proposed that the declaration be established first and then submitted to the governments for review, but the Italian representative still opposed, saying it should only be submitted to the governments for review. After repeated discussions, the representatives finally followed the Italian representative's suggestion and decided to send the draft declaration to the governments concerned. Before adjourning, eleven countries had expressed their support for the declaration, with Italy being the only one strongly dissenting. Chairman Spaak stated that the declaration would definitely be passed at the extended conference.

The seven-page declaration completely refutes Japan's arguments, stating that Japan's views on the Sino-Japanese issue and its implications are completely contrary to those of most countries. The conference confirms that the Sino-Japanese conflict is related to all countries, whether they are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty or the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The conference hopes that Japan will reconsider its decision to refuse to send representatives to the meeting, but if Japan continues to refuse, the nations must consider what attitude to take towards a signatory attempting to abolish treaty provisions considered valid by all signatories. Japan claims that this conflict only concerns China and Japan, but the members of the League of Nations have unanimously stated that this conflict is related to all signatories of the League of Nations Covenant. The hostile actions in the Far East have caused terror and resentment among the people of all countries and have made the whole world anxious. The Japanese government claims that China has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, but China is now engaged in a detailed and frank discussion of the incident, while Japan refuses to discuss the matter with any country. The representatives are convinced that direct negotiations between China and Japan cannot achieve a fair and lasting solution. If both parties agree to cease hostilities and consult with the representatives of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, then a solution can be achieved. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference resumed at 4:40 PM today. The declaration drafted by the representatives of Britain, France, and the United States was submitted for discussion. Italian representative Macchi also raised reservations on several aspects of the declaration's outline and details, stating that they could only be accepted after careful consideration. Representatives from Mexico and Portugal were willing to support the proposals made by Britain, France, and the United States, but also requested further deliberation. Australian Commonwealth representative Bruce answered briefly, which was welcomed by all parties. He stated that all nations should have the right to determine their own political systems and that the speech delivered by US chief representative Davis was constructive. British Foreign Secretary Eden, US chief representative Davis, and Canadian representative Dandurand then spoke in succession to refute the Italian representative's reservations. At this point, the chairman of the conference, former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, concluded the debate, saying that it was clear that the outline of the declaration did not need to be elaborated further and that it was sufficient to discuss the details. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference then passed the outline of the declaration at 7:45 PM in the evening and scheduled to reconvene at 4 PM on the 15th to conclude the conference. Representatives from all countries may consult their respective governments if they deem it necessary. (Central News Agency, 13th, Havas)

Brussels – After agreeing on the outline of the declaration on the Sino-Japanese dispute yesterday, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to discuss the full text tomorrow. The declaration is based on the speeches delivered by US chief representative Davis, British chief representative Eden, and French chief representative Daladier yesterday. Before the vote at the plenary meeting, the declaration expresses regret over Japan's repeated refusal to exchange views with the countries concerned and states that Japan's views are very different from those of the countries concerned. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, the commerce of all countries has suffered losses, and world public opinion has expressed anger and regret. In addition, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will also declare that Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but states that it is still willing to mediate. If this is not possible, the countries concerned will consider a common attitude to deal with it when necessary. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

Brussels – The draft declaration proposed by the British, American, and French representatives to warn Japan states that if Japan continues to reject the peaceful mediation of the Nine-Power Treaty, the conference will take strong measures against Japan. At the same time, it also refutes Japan's excuse of anti-communism. The draft declaration also earnestly hopes that Japan will change its attitude as soon as possible. However, if Japan still does not heed the conference's advice, the representatives will consider the common attitude to be taken in the event of a country violating international treaties. The draft declaration also states, "The use of force to invade the territory of another country to prevent the spread of a certain political doctrine is not stipulated in current public law." If "all countries follow suit, the international community will fall into a state of anarchy." (13th, National News)

### Agreement in Principle Reached for Countries to Assist China

Countries to Provide Mutual Assistance in Case of Unexpected Events; Britain and the Netherlands to Separately Negotiate Joint Defense Measures

[London] The Daily Telegraph's correspondent in Brussels cabled today that since Japan has refused to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the second step of the conference should be to provide financial assistance to China, a sentiment shared even by the pessimists among the representatives. (North-China Daily News, 13th, Special Dispatch)

Brussels – Britain, the United States, and France have reached agreement in principle on the supply of arms and loans to China. However, each country will be responsible for its own actions in assisting China. According to a proposal by the French government, if such actions to assist China cause any "unexpected events," the countries will take mutual assistance measures. It is reported that the Soviet Russian representative has expressed support for this plan. (13th, Haitong Cable)

[London] The Sunday Times recently reported that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, the security of British and Dutch colonies in the Far East has been threatened. The naval authorities of these countries in the Far East have negotiated several cooperation measures for self-defense. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

[London] The Sunday Times' diplomatic correspondent has learned that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, Britain and the Netherlands have discussed cooperation to protect each other's eastern territories in some way. It is now believed that this is the result of negotiations between the British and Dutch naval authorities in the Far East. Preventing the Dutch East Indies from falling into the hands of a hypothetical enemy is of great importance to British interests. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

Brussels – Chinese chief representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Wellington Koo recently told a Havas reporter that in his speech this morning, he elaborated on the sanctity of treaties and international law, which coincided with the views expressed by US chief representative Davis, British chief representative Eden, and French chief representative Daladier, reflecting the complete consistency of the principles and views advocated by the three major democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States. This is essential for maintaining world peace. It would be particularly welcome if the representatives of the countries could outline the specific measures they intend to take to implement their consistent and clearly stated principles. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

[Paris] Although the outline of the declaration drafted by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels today has not yet been released, Le Temps reports that the declaration condemns Japan in spirit. As for how to protect the general and individual interests of the countries concerned in the Far East, the countries will reserve the right to express their opinions. The declaration also states that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference cannot accept the views of the Japanese government and still hopes that Japan will abandon its negative attitude. Otherwise, the countries concerned will study the consequences that this attitude of Japan may cause. In addition, people from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference believe that Japan's attitude may ease by the end of the month and that it will be willing to talk with the countries concerned. However, it is believed that Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo's advocacy for material assistance to China by the countries concerned is not a matter for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, but should be handled by the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues.

### Future Active Actions Will Follow the Lead of the United States

London Times Commentary States Britain Will Follow Behind

[London] The Sunday Times published an editorial today stating that the Japanese government's rejection of the Belgian government's second application was surprising in every way. We had expected Japan to close the door to negotiations, but not to slam it shut so violently. The future actions of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will follow the lead of the United States. The United States will lead the way, and Britain will follow behind and cooperate. However, the actions of the United States depend entirely on public opinion within the country. Japan's goal is to make China subservient, to exclusively provide it with sales of goods, and to exploit its resources, while rejecting the influence of white people, with the exception of Italy and Germany. The United States will be excluded from the Pacific Asian coast and will face a strong, aggressive, militarist country in that area, which will threaten the United States in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Central and South America for a considerable period of time. Therefore, the US government should declare today whether or not it should take any action. European countries are preoccupied with the turmoil in Europe and have no time to look elsewhere. Japan is taking advantage of this opportunity to start a war, creating the current situation. Therefore, any active policy must first be initiated by the United States. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

[Washington] State Department officials believe that the speech of the U.S. Chief Representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Davis, is very important. First, Davis indicated that there was still room for discussion regarding Japan's two rejections of participating in the conference. Second, Davis also indicated that the United States is prepared to consider modifying the Nine-Power Treaty by peaceful means. However, Davis solemnly stated that the United States resolutely opposes modifying it by force. Therefore, official circles here firmly believe that if Japan attempts to materially harm China as a result of military action, the United States will definitely not agree. (13th, National News)
