### Original Text of Fu Zuoyi's Eulogy

[Guihua] Chairman Fu's eulogy to the war dead in the Sui Battle is as follows: "On this fifteenth day of March, the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression of the Jin-Sui Army, respectfully offers the highest tribute to the spirits of our war dead in Suiyuan: 'In this Suiyuan war of resistance, the enemy used airplanes and artillery to destroy your bodies, poisonous gas to stifle your breath, and wind and snow to tear your skin. However, relying on the boiling of your hot blood, you finally overcame everything and completed the following missions: first, you fulfilled the duty of soldiers to defend the land; second, you preserved the integrity of Suiyuan's territorial sovereignty; and third, you restored the lost national self-confidence. Today, everyone has come here, embracing profound sorrow and deep condolences. Not only your comrades-in-arms who shared your hardships, but also the highest political leaders of the country, representatives from various provinces, and colleagues from other walks of life. This is not only a manifestation of Suiyuan's corner, but the admiration of the entire country; not only the current temporary enthusiasm, but also the permanent worship in the future. As for myself, I not only do not express grief for you, but recalling your loyalty and bravery in killing the enemy, I am filled with envy. You must know that life is short, and who can escape death? But the price of death varies greatly, from lighter than a feather to heavier than Mount Tai. We who die later, even if we hold a determination to die, may not get such a chance to die, and may not be as glorious as you. When you were fighting the war, you abandoned the love of your parents and gave up the attachment of your wives, relying only on the spirit of serving the country and disregarding everything. We who are not dead must fulfill the obligation of supporting the elderly and raising the young on your behalf, so that your spirits in heaven may be comforted. In the future, we will ask the government to provide preferential treatment and pensions, and we will also appeal to society to provide compassionate assistance, hoping that your heroic sacrifice will elicit the sympathy and aid of the majority. You may still be a little worried about your mission, and I dare to give a sincere reply on behalf of you: Now that the Chinese nation has embarked on the road to rejuvenation, I believe that the mission you left behind will surely be a final success, because your fresh blood has irrigated the hearts of 400 million people and filled them with the belief in self-reliance. As long as we who are not dead still have a breath left, we should continue the great spirit you have shown and fight together. We piously shout a few slogans in front of the martyrs, which will serve as the end of this mournful elegy, that is, you fought for the survival of the country, you fought for the liberation of the nation. The future of the Republic of China, although not entirely built by your hands, has been opened up with your blood. You see that we must follow this road to rejuvenation, stepping on your bright bloodstains, and working together to move forward, forward, bravely forward!'" (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)

During the banquet, Provincial Civil Affairs Director Yuan Qinghui delivered a speech, stating that Suiyuan knew its strength was insufficient when it fought to resist the enemy last year, but it made every effort to do so. Fortunately, it received enthusiastic support from the entire country, benefiting greatly in both spirit and material. The resistance against the enemy cannot be considered over yet, and in the future, we can only uphold our original aspirations and strive forward. We are deeply grateful for the presence of the representatives at the memorial service and hereby express our thanks. Xiong Bin then gave a reply, stating that Suiyuan's resistance was due to the proper guidance of Vice Chairman Yan and Director Fu, and the efforts of the entire army and people of Suiyuan, so that it achieved great results in a very short period of time, enhanced its international status, and dealt a major blow to the enemy. In the future, the entire country will take Suiyuan's resistance as an example, and the revival of the nation is within reach. Prince Sha hosted the press on the evening of the 14th to report on the preparations for the Sui-Mongolian Conference and stated that the Mongolian and Han compatriots in Suiyuan have harmonious feelings and are united against foreign aggression. The victory in the resistance was also due to this. (15th Special Dispatch)

### Wang's Speech in Taiyuan

[Taiyuan] The original text of Chairman Wang's speech at the welcoming banquet in Taiyuan on the 14th is as follows: "I am deeply grateful and greatly admire the sincere sincerity and the spirit of striving to save the country that I have witnessed from the comrades during this trip when I was entrusted by the central government to go to Suiyuan to pay tribute to the war dead and passed through Taiyuan, where I was able to meet with Vice Chairman and comrades from all walks of life. I remember that at the end of October in the 24th year, Mr. Yan first went to Nanjing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee. Unfortunately, on November 1st, I was injured and fell at the head of the Central Party Department. I did not have the opportunity to discuss many things in detail with Mr. Yan. However, on the evening of October 30th, we had dinner together at Mr. Chiang's military academy residence. In addition to the host, Mr. Chiang, those present included Mr. Yan, as well as Zhang Hanxiang, He Jingzhi, Zhu Yizhi, Tang Mengxiao, Zhang Yuejun, Tang Youren, and myself. We exchanged serious opinions on foreign and domestic affairs. I understood the determination and planning of Mr. Chiang and Mr. Yan, which made me very relieved. Therefore, although I was injured and fell the next day, I knew in my heart that there was a solution for national affairs in the future, and I was very calm. Afterwards, I was plagued by injuries and illness and asked for leave to recuperate for several months. During this period, Mr. Chiang indeed strengthened the central government and supported the precarious situation. Mr. Yan indeed took charge of the key points and encouraged the military and civilians of Jin and Sui provinces to cooperate with the comrades in the central government to shoulder the great responsibility of defending the land and resisting the invaders. This is the key to the nation's education and the nation's revival. I cannot express my comfort and admiration in words. This time, when I returned to China, I went to Xikou to pay respects to Mr. Chiang, and yesterday I came to Taiyuan to pay respects to Mr. Yan and to meet with the comrades, and I was able to express my full respect and my inexpressible admiration. I have nothing more to say today, except to remember the two sentences in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee: 'Seek self-reliance internally, seek coexistence externally.' These two sentences can be said to be the focus of all our comrades' work. Because we seek self-reliance internally, we must unite the people and focus on production and construction. Because we seek coexistence externally, we must advance along the path of international peace. If, unfortunately, our territorial sovereignty is harmed, we will go to war with a determination to sacrifice. Some people used to say that it was 'pacifying the interior,' and others said that it was 'repelling the foreign.' In my humble opinion, these are not two things, but one thing. For example, when an army is engaged in training, replenishment, and clarifying discipline, it can be said to be internal work, and when it is engaged in aiming its guns at foreigners, it can be said to be external work. However, without training, replenishment, and clarifying discipline, the result of aiming the guns at foreigners will not be obtained. Without aiming the guns at foreigners, training, replenishment, and clarifying discipline may be meaningless. There is another level: the more tense the internal work, the more enthusiastic the external emotions, and the more confident and certain the external goals, the more solid the unity and the more consistent the words and actions, and the more internal unity is as solid as iron. It can be seen that these two things are only divided into two things in action, but in reality, they are actually one thing. This time, the military and civilians of Jin and Sui provinces have struggled hard in difficult circumstances and have shouldered the responsibility of defending the land and resisting the invaders. We have seen the solidity of internal unity and the calmness and bravery of resisting foreign aggression, which is enough to prove that the military and civilians of Jin and Sui provinces have truly achieved 'seeking self-reliance internally and seeking coexistence externally.' In the future, we can only wish the military and civilians of Jin and Sui provinces to work harder to achieve the final success. Although I have just returned from overseas, I have mostly been in sanatoriums abroad and cannot talk about any investigation. However, in my superficial view, the people of all countries are also striving for self-reliance internally and coexistence externally. The method of seeking self-reliance internally is to pay attention to the increase of national power on the one hand and the increase of people's power on the other. Because the country's expenses, especially the national defense expenses, are to be borne by the people. If we do not relieve the people's suffering and increase the people's productivity and consumption power, and at the same time, the results of production can be rationally distributed so that the people can enjoy them together, then the people's power cannot be increased, and the country's expenses will be like water without a source and trees without roots. Many people say that European countries are now divided into two major groups: one is the communist group and the other is the fascist group. In my opinion, in addition to these two groups, there is another group, which is the original democratic group. This democratic group does not have such clear barriers as communism and fascism, but its roots are deep and it can adapt to the trend of the times. It has a rational method of coordinating various peoples in the country, and it supports the collective security system abroad. For the weakness of the collective security system, it will spare no effort to maintain it and increase its effectiveness. We should pay close attention to this group. I do not want to analyze the right and wrong of these three groups today, but I would like to point out the similarities of the three groups. We remember that Sun Yat-sen said that the Principle of People's Livelihood is to control capital, and at the same time, it is said to develop national capital and protect private capital. We know that if national capital is developed, it is a wonderful way to control private capital. Because all industries that are monopolistic and cannot be undertaken by private power are undertaken by national capital, and other small and medium-sized industries are operated by private individuals, and the state protects them. When necessary, they are subjected to control. This method is not only adopted by the communist Soviet Union, from the former New Economic Policy to the recent two five-year plans, but also by fascist Italy and national socialist Germany. Even in countries that can be called the base camp of capitalism, such as Britain, private capital is very developed, but the trend of monopoly industries becoming state-owned is also very obvious. For example, the central electrical management industry is one proof. For example, France has recently planned to nationalize the forging industry. The forging industry is the largest industry in France. From this, we can know that it is necessary to develop production with the power of the state, that is, the public power of the people, and at the same time, rationally distribute the results of production so that the people can enjoy them together and increase their consumption power. This is the only way to increase the people's power, and it is also the only way to increase the national power. Our country's production is immature, the people's consumption capacity is weak, the people's power is not strong, and the national power is also weak. This is what we should be vigilant about at all times. We should abide by Sun Yat-sen's teachings of the Principle of People's Livelihood, refer to the experience of production and construction in various countries, and work together as a country to engage in production and construction, so that we can be self-reliant internally and coexist externally. The importance of this significance has been told to us very solemnly and sincerely in the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee. What I have said above is to explain that seeking self-reliance internally and seeking coexistence externally are one thing, not two things. This reason is very obvious, because external affairs require strength. This kind of strength is called national power because it is external. The increase of national power is the increase of external strength, and the increase of national power is based on the increase of people's power. Therefore, increasing the people's power is increasing the national power. Pacifying the interior and repelling the foreign are not two things, but one thing. The reason lies in this. If we only talk about external affairs, we have had the determination to resist the war in the past few years, and we have also endured humiliation. Not only have we endured humiliation, but we have also borne heavy burdens. The so-called bearing heavy burdens, in essence, is to make various preparations. These preparations have been accumulated over time and cannot be said to have achieved nothing, but they cannot be satisfactory. (Moreover, when enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, what we should pay attention to is not only the accumulation of material, but also the disappearance of spirit. Because when enduring humiliation, the government has various unspeakable secrets, and the people see the government's endurance, but do not see the government's burden, which is very harmful to their spirit. I have repeatedly said that our people's spirit should not be arrogant or depressed, but calm. But how many people understand the meaning of calm and put it into practice? Therefore, if the people understand the government's responsibility, we are indeed grateful, even if we are strictly blamed for endurance, we are also grateful. What I hope is calm, calm preparation for everything, and then when necessary, we will calmly resist the war with a determination to sacrifice. It is our wish to protect the life of the whole country, and it is also our wish to protect the personality of the country if we cannot protect the life of the country. As long as we understand that pacifying the interior and repelling the foreign are not two things, but one thing, then we can all understand each other without words. My feelings are just like this. Now, I would like to express my deep respect for the determination and achievements of the military and civilians of Jin and Sui provinces to defend the land and resist the invaders."

[Nanjing] Ambassador Kawagoe introduced the members of the Economic Survey Mission at today's banquet and then gave a speech. The main points are recorded below.

Second, all of you are giants in creating today's Japanese financial world. Therefore, the experience and knowledge you share will surely contribute to China's construction. Third, to adjust national relations, it is necessary to promote the harmony of national sentiments. Therefore, I believe that your visit to China is a timely opportunity.

### Smugglers Attempt to Expand Cang County Incident

Japanese Merchant Automobile Company Established in Tianjin, Making it More Difficult for Our Side to Combat Smuggling

### Mourning the Soldiers and Civilians Who Died in the Suiyuan War of Resistance

— Yi

Yesterday was the date of the memorial service for the soldiers and civilians who died in the Suiyuan War. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, and Yan Xishan, Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, personally presided over the ceremony in Gui Sui. Half-masts were flown throughout the country in mourning. Various agencies and schools in Peiping and Tianjin also held memorial services. This solemn and stirring emotion that permeated the country shows that the spirit of the heroes who died in the borderlands is immortal, and it demonstrates the unified will and great strength of the Chinese nation. Therefore, we must not regard this memorial service as an ordinary ceremony.

Our entire nation pays tribute to the soldiers and civilians who died in Suiyuan last winter. It is not only because they died for the country, but more importantly, because their heroic resistance restored the nation's self-confidence and brought a ray of light to the path of national rejuvenation. We can never forget November 24th of last year, the most glorious day in modern history. The recovery of Bailingmiao on this day can be simply described as a miracle from the perspective of military knowledge. Because in terms of weapons and terrain, the enemy had an absolute advantage. Moreover, because of diplomatic relations, we had to allow the enemy's intelligence agencies to operate in our command headquarters, making it extremely difficult to maintain military secrets. Under such circumstances, the soldiers and civilians of Suiyuan, relying solely on their courage and the encouragement of their compatriots across the country, were able to seize the enemy's strongholds, such as Bailingmiao and Damao. This powerfully proves that the strength of the national spirit surpasses everything. The most modern airplanes, artillery, and even poisonous gas may sometimes lose their effectiveness against warriors with a strong sense of national identity. The lessons we learned from the various battles in Suiyuan have clearly made the foundation of Chinese unity more solid. How can we not mourn those compatriots who died in the war with the utmost sorrow?

Now the ceremony of the memorial service is over. Our compatriots across the country should think of the two major responsibilities that are on our shoulders. First, we must do everything possible to provide substantial compensation to the families of those who died defending the country. Second, although the front line of national defense has entered a state of calm, the hidden dangers are growing. We must rouse our spirits to inherit the will and mission of those compatriots who died for the country. Then the heroic spirits in the battlefield can rest in peace.

### Roosevelt's Legal Reform

Difficult to Reach an Agreement Quickly

[Washington] The Senate Judiciary Committee announced today that it has changed its review plan, so President Roosevelt's Supreme Court reform plan cannot be made into a bill form for several months. The committee originally planned to hear the opinions of the opposition within this week, but now it has decided to spend the entire week reviewing the opinions of the supporters. Both the supporters and opponents know that the majority of congressmen do not seek a quick solution, so they are unwilling to do things hastily. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a total of 18 members, of whom 6 support the reform plan, 7 oppose it, and 5 are undecided. The Supreme Court will open trial tomorrow, and there should be important rulings on cases that have been put on hold during the two-week holiday. (14th National Telegram)

[New York] The New York Times recently reported that Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently advocated amending President Roosevelt's judicial system reform plan and said that he would propose a constitutional amendment to increase the number of Supreme Court judges from nine to fifteen. This compromise would prevent the judicial system reform plan from having the appearance of retaliation against judges who oppose the president's New Deal, and most liberal judges would no longer have doubts.

### Japanese Navy Supports Sato's Diplomacy

Right-Wing Members of Parliament Demand Foreign Minister's Resignation, Sugiyama Explains the Scope of Military Interference

[Tokyo] Today, two right-wing members of the House of Representatives visited Foreign Minister Sato Naotake, issued a warning, and demanded that Sato resign to apologize to the people. However, on the other hand, Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa said during a debate in the House of Representatives this afternoon that the navy fully agrees with Sato's speech and expresses its sympathy. (Central News Agency, 15th Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato met with eight members of the House of Peers and six members of the House of Representatives this afternoon and gave a detailed and specific explanation of the new diplomatic policy for two and a half hours. Sato's move was aimed at clearing up misunderstandings from all sides caused by his previous speech and clarifying his diplomatic beliefs again. The members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives that Sato met included Yoshizawa Kenkichi, Obata Yugu, Debuchi Katsuji, and Ashida Hitoshi. (Central News Agency, 15th Dispatch)

[Tokyo] The House of Peers Budget General Meeting was held today. Matsumura raised a question, expressing deep concern about whether the "human element" was sufficient in strengthening Japan's military preparations, and pointed out that the new budget included a large increase in taxes and the issuance of deficit bonds for the purpose of expanding the army and navy. If so, the material elements of expanding military preparations may be achieved, but the "human element", which is equally necessary as the material element in strengthening military strength, is still lacking. This is a very worrying fact, especially because of the existence of the "horizontal group" within the army and the trend of "inferiors overpowering superiors." Matsumura continued to cite the February 26th Incident and the military's interference when Ugaki Kazushige formed a cabinet, saying that if such phenomena existed for a day, no matter how good the material conditions were, the expansion of military preparations would be difficult to achieve the desired material effect. Army Minister Sugiyama Gen denied the existence of the "horizontal group" within the army in his reply, but admitted the fact that officers who graduated from the same class, served in the same army, or came from the same county, etc., united to study various issues. Sugiyama also promised to strictly control any "inferiors overpowering superiors." (Central News Agency, 15th Dispatch)

[Tokyo] At the House of Peers Budget General Meeting today, Matsumura Giichi of the Koseikai first raised questions and asked Army Minister Matsuyama in detail about the military's control and the handling of the Army Ministry Bureau at the time of the February 26th Incident. The Army Minister then expressed his views on broad national defense, saying that soldiers belonging to the people are not indifferent to politics. If their thoughts are elsewhere, the Army Minister will make them realize it. Therefore, the direct interference of active-duty soldiers in politics should not be allowed. Because I am related to state affairs, I express my views, and those who assist me also need to study this matter. Broad national defense is related to everything. Therefore, the army sends personnel to each province, and they also express their opinions on the negotiations. This matter is absolutely necessary for broad national defense. If you perfunctorily prevaricate, you should not be loyal to your duties. It should be considered my task to have my subordinates study the necessities of national defense, make decisions for it, and implement them. Break at 0:05 PM. (15th Allied News Agency Dispatch)

### The Peace Movement Gains Momentum in Various European and American Countries

The U.S. Awaits an Opportunity to Convene a Disarmament Conference; French People's Front Demonstrates for Peace; Britain and Russia Hear of a Peace and Friendship Conference

[Washington] The U.S. government authorities have been carefully studying the foreign war crisis these days, but are unwilling to immediately convene a world peace conference or resume the disarmament conference. Diplomatic authorities have reportedly decided that they do not want to give a "hopeless indication" that would put the United States at a disadvantage. However, if the movement to limit armaments has a chance of success in the future, the United States will also be happy to initiate it. (Fifteenth National Telegram)

[New York] The New York Times recently reported that President Roosevelt is currently waiting for an appropriate opportunity to propose a peace plan, with the main point being the reduction of armaments. It also stated that "some key officials in the State Department and spokespersons from other government agencies have said that President Roosevelt is very willing to assist European countries in establishing peace, and it would not be surprising if the President were to propose an international disarmament agreement." At this time, Britain's stance is based on Germany's rearmament. President Roosevelt has expressed sympathy for Britain's attitude, so he does not intend to propose a complete abolition of armaments, but only requests a reduction in the existing armament plans of various countries. The President is currently resting at Warm Springs, Georgia, and the U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, is also accompanying him. This move has made the general public even more interested in the President's peace plan. In the past, Bullitt had the honor of traveling for the President on various international issues, and it is unknown whether he will once again contribute to the President this time.

⊙ Strasbourg The parties of the People's Front recently held a demonstration here to advocate for peace. 30,000 people attended. Perrin, Director of the Scientific Research Department and Professor at the University of Paris, served as the chairman. First, Gutnay, a representative of the Human Rights Protection League, spoke in favor of establishing overall peace based on the principle of collective security and requested the government to reconsider the issue of maintaining neutrality in the Spanish Civil War.

㊀ Oppose the organization of a "Crusade Plan" by democratic countries.

㊁ Oppose the division of Europe into two major opposing blocs.

㊂ Advocate that France should coexist peacefully with all nations, regardless of the political system they adopt.

㊃ Request the government to propose a collective and monitored disarmament plan. Finally, declare that countries should seek sincere cooperation on a common economic plan. Once Germany and Italy accept this economic plan and no longer interfere in the Spanish Civil War to oppose the Spanish Republic, they should then cooperate with the two countries.

[London] The Second Anglo-Soviet Peace and Friendship Congress opened here yesterday. Approximately one thousand representatives attended, representing two million members of various British political parties and public groups. Metcalfe, a well-known British engineer and shipbuilder known as a Soviet expert, delivered the opening address, pointing out the great success of the Congress. Litvinov then announced that the Congress had received many congratulatory telegrams, including telegrams from famous figures such as Romain Rolland, Vandervelde, and Bishop Birmingham. Romain Rolland's telegram stated that the new Soviet Constitution is the most rational and intelligent effort to realize democracy in the world, and we must support the Soviet Union because it is the strongest fortress for world peace and the guarantee of democracy. When Soviet Ambassador Maisky gave a speech, the assembly cheered unanimously, and the speech was interrupted by applause, especially when mentioning the new Soviet Constitution and its peaceful policies and power. When Maisky stated that the Soviet Union's struggle for peace relies on its own great economic and military strength, as well as the progressive elements of various countries around the world as its support, the entire audience burst into thunderous applause. Fort, a Liberal Party Member of Parliament, then reported on the new Soviet Constitution, calling it the most important factor of our time. Adams, a Conservative Party Member of Parliament, spoke, stating that the interests of the Soviet Union and Britain are consistent on the issue of safeguarding peace in Europe and the Far East. Cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France can make the League of Nations an irresistible force. Adams also pointed out that since joining the League of Nations, the Soviet Union has been as faithful to the principles of the League as any other country. Lady Astor spoke, stating that the Franco-Soviet Pact is of great significance for world peace, and Anglo-Soviet cooperation is also absolutely important for safeguarding British interests, to which the entire assembly applauded unanimously.

### Japan Believes Disarmament Will Not Succeed

Says it does not oppose convening a conference, but Britain and the United States should abandon shipbuilding.

[Tokyo] There are rumors from Washington that a new disarmament conference is about to be convened, and the British government has also appointed Craigie, who is well-versed in disarmament matters, as the ambassador to Japan to indicate its forward-looking trend. However, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs believes that judging from the current international situation, it is too early to hold a disarmament conference, or there is little hope of success. On the Japanese government's side, if the fundamental principles of disarmament proposed by Japan, which are not to threaten or invade, are fully recognized by all countries and disarmament is thoroughly implemented, then Japan will have no reason to oppose convening a conference. However, Britain has already implemented its large-scale shipbuilding plan of 1.5 billion pounds, and the United States is also implementing naval expansion. Countries such as France, Germany, and the Soviet Union are also carrying out plans to strengthen their armaments. In today's world, where countries are emulating each other, even if disarmament is advocated, it will be difficult for countries to agree. Since the situation is like this, if Britain and the United States are truly sincere in convening a conference, they should take the lead in abandoning their large-scale shipbuilding plans before initiating it. Otherwise, it will be difficult to succeed. Moreover, nearly one year has passed since the London Disarmament Conference ended, and the attitude of various countries towards Japan's proposals has not changed drastically. It also seems that the large-scale shipbuilding of European and American countries has not stopped. Therefore, the Japanese authorities believe that convening a disarmament conference today is not convenient at all. (Fifteenth, Dōmei Telegram)

### Japan's Military Industry

Advances Rapidly

[Tokyo] Today's world economy is thriving with military industries based on expansion as its core. This is most evident in the recent Japanese national economy, which has followed the pace of this world trend and continued its military expansion boom. Looking at the heavy industry sectors that are the foundation of the military expansion process, the trends since Showa 6 (1931) can be proven. The production value of heavy industry has continued to increase year by year. For example, the machinery industry was over 410 million yen in Showa 6, but reached over 1.458 billion yen in Showa 10 (1935), an increase of about 3.5 times. The metal industry was over 431 million yen in Showa 6, but reached over 1.879 billion yen in Showa 10, an increase of about 4.5 times. The shipbuilding and dock industry was over 87 million yen in Showa 6, but increased to over 153 million yen in Showa 9 (1934), about 2 times. The chemical industry was 813 million yen in Showa 6, but increased to over 1.826 billion yen in Showa 10, about 2 times stronger. However, Japan's military expansion has not been fully reflected in this survey. Since Showa 11 (1936), it will be even more active. Therefore, the trend expressed in this statistic will only increase in the future. (Fifteenth, Dōmei Telegram)

### French Defense Minister Delivers a Speech on the Expansion of Armaments in Various Countries

Urges People to Quickly Purchase National Defense Bonds to Protect the Safety of Future Generations

[Paris] Minister of National Defense Daladier delivered a radio broadcast speech tonight, appealing to the people of the country to subscribe to national defense bonds. He first stated that national defense bonds are exclusively for temporary national defense expenses and will be issued in batches from now until December of this year, with a total amount set at 10.5 billion francs. Among them, 26% will be used for aviation, 28% for the navy, and 46% for the army. He also stated that national defense expenses are used to ensure the safety of future generations in France and that bonds should be raised to provide funds. The expenses required for the construction of fortresses in northeastern France recently also came from bond fundraising. Furthermore, if national defense expenses are to be raised quickly, issuing bonds is the only way to succeed. He then described the international situation of expanding armaments to prove the legitimacy of France issuing national defense bonds. For example, since occupying the Rhineland area, Germany has trained a land army of one million members and created high-speed armored divisions, equipped with artillery for bombing tank armies. Its air force and navy are also being reorganized with great ambition. Italy is also making every effort to develop its air force and navy. As for the Soviet Union, its standing army has over 1.3 million personnel, in addition to thousands of tanks and thousands of training aircraft. Its powerful navy is currently under construction. In addition, countries such as Poland and the Little Entente are also making great efforts to strengthen their armaments. Even Switzerland recently raised national defense bonds in just a few hours. Finally, regarding Britain, which has always had a strong belief in reducing armaments, it recently decided to spend a huge amount of 16 billion francs on national defense expenses within five years. As for our France, its dedication to peace is known to the world, but empty words cannot compensate for reality. We must have sufficient strength to achieve this. Our duty lies solely in ensuring that our country's army, navy, and air force have great strength and rapid effectiveness. Regarding the army, there are many tasks that need to be completed. The borders in the northern and eastern Jura Mountains of our country are equipped with defenses, which should now be strengthened to block the historical paths of foreign enemies invading France. This is the first. Build a large number of tanks to rely on steel cover to attack enemy forces in wartime. This is the second. Develop artillery and armaments for attacking tanks. This is the third. Furthermore, the air force must increase its strength to allow us to control our country's air space, and the navy must be renovated to ensure the freedom of transportation between our country and its colonies. In short, national defense bonds must be successful in order to make valuable international friendships more certain. When France is respected in the world, it can then fulfill its duty to protect justice and reason. All of us French people, united in one heart, yearn only for this ideal of justice and reason.

### Poland Establishes a United Front

A Group Organized by the Right Wing; The Left Wing Remains Opposed

⊙ Warsaw Since Colonel Koc, a confidant of Lieutenant General Ryz-Smigly, Director of Military Education, established the "National Unity Front" on February 21, he convened an inaugural meeting here today. Approximately 500 representatives from various rural branches attended. The organization of this National Front has encountered many difficulties. So far, in addition to the groups organized by heavy industry employers and local landlords being willing to join, other groups, such as the People's Party led by Mayor Witos of Geyvo, which has considerable influence, are opposed to the front. The various labor unions and the Socialist Party are also opposed to it. Even the various professional groups established by former Minister of Military Affairs General Pilsudski, which belong to the government, have refused to join. Therefore, in the future, the National Front should recruit party members among young people, which should be unproblematic. However, some nationalists among the young people are still hesitant. Colonel Koc still needs to continue his efforts. Political figures predict that, in any case, Koc will not give up his attempt to organize the National Front, as Colonel Koc is a calm, persevering, and orderly person. He took six months to draft the National Front's manifesto, and then spent six months on organization. In the future, he should first unite the bourgeoisie and then focus on other aspects.

### Mussolini Publishes Pamphlet to Incite Arab Nationalities

Claims to be a Protector of Muslims; Provokes Refutation from Muslim Leaders; London Newspapers Pay Close Attention

[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini has been issuing challenging remarks to countries with colonies, claiming to be the sole protector of Muslims and Arabs. In the pamphlet "Italy's Islamic Policy," recently issued by Mussolini, he stated that among the Islamic countries in the Mediterranean region, only Libya enjoys peace, and that country is an Italian colony in North Africa. He also stated that the Italian Empire provides the utmost protection for the Islamic faith and never attempts to convert Muslims to Christianity. Other countries, such as Algiers, often experience rebellions and riots, while Morocco and Tunis are politically unstable. As for Palestine, although Britain has suppressed it with cruel means, the restlessness of the Arabs has no end. The publication of this pamphlet is actually the peak of Italy's radio propaganda in Bari on the Adriatic coast, which has a great influence on the faith of the Arab people in Britain. However, after the above-mentioned pamphlet was published, the Italian authorities immediately withdrew it, omitting the above points, and only issued a kind of pamphlet. (Central News Agency, Fifteenth, Reuters Telegram)

[London] Mussolini's pamphlet, which claims that Italy is the sole protector of Muslims and Arabs, has been refuted by Imam Ahmed of the Surrey Mosque. Ahmed told a Reuters reporter that Muslims in the British Empire have freedom of religion and therefore have sincere love for British rule. He also stated that if Mussolini could treat the Islamic people of Italian territories with the same magnanimity, then the Muslims' love for Italian rule would be equal to that enjoyed by the British monarch.

He inspected the Acropolis and other ancient temples and modern excavation sites there for a long time. Mussolini also donated 80,000 lire to Islamic charitable organizations in Derna. Leaders of Islamic societies have sent telegrams to Mussolini to express their welcome. At the same time, people from all over the inland areas gathered in groups along the roads where Mussolini passed to catch a glimpse of his demeanor. (Fourteenth National Telegram)

[London] Prime Minister Mussolini's activities in North Africa have been watched by the entire British press. Today, all newspapers published Mussolini's declaration yesterday. The Daily Telegraph, under the headline "Britain Accused of Oppressing Palestinian Arabs," stated that Italian people are proud of the new military highway along the Libyan coast, but disasters may also follow. The newspaper also explicitly warned the Arabs that if they rely too much on Italy's protection, the result may develop into a shocking situation. The appointment of a naval officer as Governor of Eritrea by Italy is also considered noteworthy by the British press. It is said that the position of Governor of Eritrea was previously held by army officers or ordinary people and has never been held by a naval officer. Therefore, it is generally openly stated that this is another step in Mussolini's plan to surround Britain's power in the Mediterranean. (Fifteenth National Telegram)

[Rome] The Catholic Church has now taken an important step to establish its authority in East Africa. According to a recent decision by the Catholic Cardinal Conference, all Italian East African territories will be divided into several dioceses, with the boundaries of each district based on the administrative regions of Italy, and with one supreme leader in charge. Diocesan priests will be given the task of managing the spiritual needs of Roman Catholics in Abyssinia. As for the original beliefs of the natives in each district, they will be allowed to continue to be retained without interference.

### "Eastern Hebei" Puppet Organization Rampantly Issues Counterfeit Currency

With No Fixed Amount and Not Redeemable, Forced Use Disrupts the Market

Tianjin Dispatch: The puppet organization in "Eastern Hebei" has been experiencing an unusual financial strain recently, with monthly deficits. The organization's annual expenses are approximately 8 million yuan. The bulk of its revenue comes from smuggling taxes collected at the puppet customs checkpoints in Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe. However, due to increased anti-smuggling efforts by our side, smuggling tax revenues have sharply declined. Furthermore, Yin Rugeng, to bolster his personal cronies' power, established a puppet Security Supplementary Corps, comprising two districts and six brigades, totaling 2,500 men. This has led to substantial expenditures, and the funding for various county administrations is in arrears for as long as four months. All levels of puppet officials are complaining. Yin, in order to cope with the expenses, but lacking any magical ability to create wealth, resorted to a bizarre scheme, ordering the puppet "Eastern Hebei" Bank to print large quantities of counterfeit banknotes and mint counterfeit coins. The counterfeit banknotes were issued in denominations of 100 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 1 yuan, and 5 jiao, while the counterfeit coins were issued in denominations of 2 jiao, 1 jiao, 5 fen, 1 fen, and ½ fen. The 2 jiao and 1 jiao coins are made of nickel, while the 5 fen, 1 fen, and ½ fen coins are made of copper. There is no fixed amount for the issuance of these counterfeit banknotes and coins, and they are not redeemable. The people are forced to use them.

On the 10th, the puppet "Eastern Hebei" Bank issued notices in Tongxian and Tangshan, stating, "This bank is ordered to issue banknotes in denominations of 100 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 1 yuan, and 5 jiao, and coins in denominations of 2 jiao, 1 jiao, 5 fen, 1 fen, and ½ fen. Starting from today, we will first issue 10 yuan (printed with the Dacheng Hall of the Confucius Temple in Tongxian) and 5 jiao (printed with the First Pass Under Heaven) banknotes, and 1 jiao coins. Everyone is required to use them equally." On the morning of the 11th, the Tangshan Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations convened an emergency joint meeting specifically regarding the puppet "Eastern Hebei" Bank's issuance of counterfeit banknotes and coins. They invited Mr. Fu, the head of the Tangshan branch of the puppet "Eastern Hebei" Bank, to attend. Mr. Fu announced on the spot that all types of banknotes and coins issued by the bank could be redeemed at the Chosen Bank of Tianjin and were universally accepted for paying taxes. However, the representatives of merchants and citizens present were concerned that there were no redemption locations within "Eastern Hebei," and that this would cause difficulties in circulation. Since the amount of issuance was not fixed, they believed it would certainly disrupt the market and financial system. They specifically requested that the statutory reserve be deposited in local banks to allow for redemption at any time. However, Mr. Fu was acting under orders and could not accept this, so the meeting adjourned without a result. On the day the counterfeit currency was issued, the "Eastern Hebei" puppet security police and staff of various government agencies took it to shop on the streets. Because the redemption issue had not yet been resolved, businesses refused to accept it. However, the puppet security police believed that this counterfeit currency was issued by their superiors as a month's salary, and now they were being refused, so they were unwilling to accept it. The merchants and citizens, however, believed it involved their capital and were unwilling to accept it, leading to arguments and fights breaking out repeatedly. The market immediately presented a scene of chaos. On the morning of the 12th, the Tangshan Chamber of Commerce convened another emergency joint meeting to discuss requesting redemption measures. At that time, the Tangshan puppet police bureau received a telegram from Yin Rugeng in Tongxian, stating that anyone who refused to use counterfeit currency would be severely punished for disrupting the financial system. Sun Shiyong, the head of the puppet police bureau, immediately dispatched police officers to the Chamber of Commerce to suppress the meeting and forcibly disband the crowd, and arrested Mr. Li and another standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce for questioning. For a time, the puppet police were mobilized, and people were in a state of panic. From then on, counterfeit currency was everywhere in the streets. Everyone was angry but dared not speak out. Alas, what can be done for the people of "Eastern Hebei"? According to reports, the puppet organization's issuance of counterfeit currency is a temporary measure to raise funds and relieve poverty, without any preparation whatsoever. As for the Chosen Bank acting as a redemption agent, it is merely exchanging its own banknotes for the counterfeit currency with the aim of circulating it in Tianjin and disrupting our country's financial system (13th).

### Japan Actively Scours for Copper and Iron

Nearly 20 Million Worth Collected in Guangdong, Also Exploiting Mines in Various Parts of Southeast Asia

Shantou Dispatch: In recent years, countries around the world have been actively expanding their military and manufacturing armaments, leading to a surge in the price of copper and iron due to the demand for collection. It is understood that scrap iron is selling for 78 Hong Kong dollars per ton, red steel for 55 Hong Kong dollars per 100 catties, and bronze for 42 Hong Kong dollars per 100 catties. New copper sheets and steel bars are currently out of stock in the market, and prices are uncertain. Many large-scale construction projects have been temporarily suspended due to material constraints. Many old, dilapidated vehicles and ships in the city have been dismantled and sold for good prices. Last year, waste copper and scrap iron worth over 17 million Hong Kong dollars were absorbed and shipped out by Japanese trading companies from Guangzhou and Shantou. This absorption is still ongoing. In the Shantou market, one large ocean dollar can be exchanged for 240 copper coins. If they are smuggled to Hong Kong, 150 can be exchanged for one Hong Kong dollar. Since there are many who smuggle them out, it was discovered by the Chaozhou Customs, which seized 90 hemp bags, each bag weighing 100 catties, totaling 9,000 catties. If this continues, it will not be difficult for the Chinese copper dollar to be completely swept away. Japan is very active in searching for steel and iron in Guangzhou, Shantou, and various Southeast Asian ports. Each time Japanese ships return to Japan from Southeast Asia, they must carry a large amount of waste copper and iron and metal minerals. It is reported that the price of rubber and tin ingots in British Malaya has risen sharply, but the metal tools used in rubber plantations and tin mines have suffered from a lack of copper and iron raw materials, which has become a serious problem. Currently, most of the scrap iron and iron ore seedlings in Malaya have fallen into the hands of the Japanese. In Gudouba, Johor, there is the Ishihara Corporation of Japan, and in Bukit Besi, Longwen Port, Terengganu, there is the Japan Iron Mining Company of Japan. Large-scale mining has been underway since last year. In the year before last, 1.41 million tons were produced, and last year mountain production increased by 200,000 tons. It has been found that in the past five years, a total of 6 million tons of iron ore have been mined in Johor and Terengganu, all of which have been transported back to Japan. The Ishihara Corporation has been engaged in Southeast Asian shipping for many years, with a capital of over 300,000 British pounds. This year, it has obtained the concession for a limonite mine in Jileng, Johor, from the Sultan of Johor. It is currently constructing a 50-mile light rail line to facilitate mining, and it is expected to mine 1 million tons of steel annually. From this, it can be seen that Japan has been meticulously planning for this.

### New Canal to Be Opened in Central Hubei

Connecting the Yangtze and Han Rivers to Facilitate Freight Transport Between Provinces, the Yangtze-Han River Engineering Bureau Has Sent Personnel to Survey

Hankou Dispatch: Shashi and Shayang are major towns in the Yangtze and Han River basins. Commerce is developed, and freight transport is frequent. Water transport relies solely on the Bian River. There are two routes on the Bian River. The first route starts from Shashi, passes through 30 li to Guanzukou, then 60 li to Chang Lake to Hougang. Its water volume allows large ships to travel for seven months each year and small boats for five months. From Hougang to Gaoqiao, 20 li, the water volume is even smaller and only small boats can travel. Then, after 15 li of the Xiao River, it reaches Shayang. However, because it is separated by the Yangtze and Xiang embankments, ships on the Yangtze River and Xiang River cannot directly pass between them, resulting in the freight transport between Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces, and northern Henan, southern Henan, and northern Shaanxi, having to use both large and small boats for transshipment. Furthermore, it requires manpower to carry goods across the Yangtze and Xiang embankments. In addition, due to the lack of water sources, the riverbed is gradually silting up, and the river channel is becoming narrower. Residents on both banks can only drink polluted water. Therefore, the Shashi and Shayang Chambers of Commerce, the Inland River Navigation Administration, the Hubei River Transport Bureau, and other organizations have all suggested dredging. The second route starts from Shashi, passes through the old channel for 70 li to the Xijing River (also known as the Central Xiang River) to Haozikou in Qianjiang County, then 50 li to Zekou to enter the Xiang River, and goes upstream 60 li to reach Shayang. It is longer and more winding than the first route. Its obstruction and silting are also quite similar. Wu Tingyang, the Director of the Department of Construction, upon the request of the Shashi and Shayang Chambers of Commerce, went to inspect with Xu Guorui, the Director of the Jingjiang Embankment Engineering Bureau, as a guide. The result was that this issue was deemed extremely important, but dredging the Bian River was only a temporary solution. An overall plan should be added to open up a new canal route so that small steamships can travel to connect the Yangtze and Han River waterways. As for which route should be used and how it should be designed technically, after returning to the department, he ordered the responsible department to draft three points of opinion: 1) The water levels of the Han River (Shayang) and the Yangtze River (Shashi) are generally higher than those of the Bian River. Therefore, the two terminals of the Bian River are separated by the riverbanks of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, so that the waterways of the Bian River and the Yangtze and Han Rivers cannot be directly connected, which is very inconvenient. The Bian River is the shortest distance separating the Yangtze and Han Rivers. The situation should be considered, and a lock should be built at each of the north and south terminals to connect the waterways of the Yangtze and Han Rivers with the Bian River. Then, ships on the Yangtze River can directly enter the Han River through the Bian River between Shashi and Shayang, and vice versa, ships can directly enter the Yangtze River from the Han River. In this way, the freight transport between Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces and northern Hubei, southern Henan, and northern Shaanxi can fully utilize the waterway, saving the 1,800-mile detour around Hankou and avoiding the transshipment across the embankment in Shashi and Shayang. 2) The reason why the Bian River is becoming increasingly silted up is that there is no water source to flush the sediment, so the river channel is becoming shallower. The water of the Yangtze and Han Rivers should be allowed to flow into the Bian River, gathering at Chang Lake. The area of Chang Lake is very large and can store a considerable amount of water. If it is reorganized, it can be used as a small reservoir to accommodate part of the floodwater, which will benefit the flood control plan. According to the "Opinions on the Future Treatment of the Han River" written by the Han River Flood Survey Team, the dredging of the Bian River is also listed as the first line of the proposed dredging. 3) The Yangtze and Han Rivers are separated from Chang Lake. The water level is very low during the dry season, which has an impact on farmland. If there is a no-water gate or a lock, the water level of Chang Lake can be adjusted, which will greatly benefit agricultural irrigation. Wu Tingyang believes that this case is related to the connection of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, the discharge of floodwaters, the irrigation of farmland, and is an important water conservancy construction project. It should be promptly and thoroughly measured by the Yangtze-Han River Engineering Bureau, and an overall plan should be formulated for early implementation. After being submitted to the Provincial Government for approval, the Yangtze-Han River Engineering Bureau was instructed to handle it promptly. According to news from the Yangtze-Han River Engineering Bureau, the bureau previously conducted a preliminary survey of a new canal to be opened from Shashi to the Xiang River to connect the Yangtze River with Xiang River water transport and traffic. However, it was still brief and could not be used as a basis for design. The bureau has dispatched a survey team to re-measure. Later, because the Xiang Embankment in Zhongxiang suffered an unprecedented flood and breach, the survey personnel were not enough to allocate. For the sake of urgency, the personnel sent to measure the Bian River were transferred to work on the distant embankment. The previously dispatched survey team will now be transferred back to continue the completion in order to study the route of the canal and whether there is an opportunity to utilize hydropower for power generation. An overall design will be made after the survey work is completed (March 14).

New Guangfeng Flour Mill Established

In addition to Tailong, which was completely burned down last year, there are still Jiufeng and Maoxin No. 1 flour mills in this county, both of which have started production. Recently, Yang Hanxi and others have raised huge sums of money to establish the Guangfeng Flour Mill in Changmao Town, Guangqin Road, Zhoushan浜. The factory building is currently under construction. The required machinery, the latest German model, has been purchased and will arrive in Shanghai soon and be transported to Wuxi for installation. It is expected to start production when the new wheat comes onto the market.

Business Status of the Wuxi-Shanghai Road

Since the Wuxi-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Company started operating last year, due to transportation needs, passengers have been crowded, especially in the Wuxi-Changshu section and the Changshu-Shanghai section. The Suzhou-Changshu section is greatly affected by the competition of small boats with falling prices and bridges with a highly tilted design, as passengers are shaken violently when the bus goes up and down the bridge approaches. The company has a total of 75 buses. In addition to the ten or so buses that are often under repair, the rest are running regularly. The daily operating revenue of the entire line is about 2,200 yuan, and the annual revenue is 792,000 yuan. The annual expenditure reaches 1.8 million yuan. Last year's surplus was more than 200,000 yuan. The company has also decided to hold a shareholders' meeting in Shanghai on the 28th of this month to add a large number of vehicles and install dedicated telephone lines at each station in order to facilitate news along the route.

Large Quantities of Fuel Leaving the Country

The fuel used by civilians here is rice straw, bean husks, cotton husks, and other plant materials. However, it is now noticed that the prices of various fuels in the firewood shops in the urban and rural areas have suddenly skyrocketed and are out of stock. After investigation, the reason is that someone has recently been transporting large quantities of fuel out of the country. Some people are going to various villages to purchase them and sell them to Haimen, Chongming, and Gutong. Each load can earn at least 2 jiao or so. If each ship carries 300 loads, one shipment can make 60 or 70 yuan. As a result, there are more and more transporters, and at least 1,000 loads are leaving the country every day. If this continues, there will be a fuel shortage for the civilians in this county.

### Zhenjiang

Resolution: The original proposing school (Taishi) will draft the format and submit it to the board of directors for processing.

Resolution: Request the Education Department to increase the meal fee for normal school students to six yuan per month. (3) Please restore the original five hours per week for biology classes.

(15) Currently, all secondary schools are implementing the special education syllabus and military and scout management. Those who serve as directors and grade-level counselors work more than 14 hours a day, and even ordinary counselors work more than 10 hours a day, which not only hinders further study but also harms their health. The Education Department should be requested to find ways to provide relief. Resolution: Passed as originally proposed. (16) Last year, the Education Department appointed school principals to organize education inspection groups. The Education Department should be requested to appoint faculty and staff to organize visiting groups this year to facilitate further study. Resolution: Passed as originally proposed. (17) The provincial education budget for the 26th year allocates 20,000 yuan for provincial school teachers to rest for one year after serving for nine years.

(4) Pay the highest respect to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of the President. (5) Pay respect to the portraits of Chairman Chiang and Vice-Chairmen Dai and He.

Chairman's Report: The conference presidium consisted of Leng Xueqiao, Zhao Weizu, Luo Lie, Commander Sun Fuxin, Disciplinarian Gong Jingyuan, Master of Ceremonies Jin Shaowen, and Recorder Xia Huanxin. After the ceremony proceeded as usual, Chairman Leng Xueqiao gave a report. He briefly stated that since the establishment of the Chinese scout movement in the first year of the Republic, the organization has been fragmented, and the training has been uncoordinated. Until March 15th of the 15th year of the Republic, the central government decided that the national scout movement would be uniformly guided by the Party, renamed the Party Scouts. Since then, the scout movement has gradually developed. In the 17th year of the Republic, the Scout Headquarters was established. In the 23rd year of the Republic, the General Association was established in Beijing. The March 15th is the biggest turning point for the Chinese scout movement to have the status it has today, so we cannot but commemorate and celebrate it. We should always take the oath and regulations as the foundation of our lives, prepare to serve, do one good deed every day, and never forget it throughout our lives. Today, while celebrating the China Scout Day, we should also mourn the soldiers and civilians who died in the Suiyuan anti-Japanese war. We should recall the spirit of sacrifice during the Suiyuan anti-Japanese war, strive for self-improvement, continue their unfinished will, and strive to promote the glorious spirit of our nation in the past.

Tong's Speech: Then, City Party Headquarters member Tong Hangbai gave a speech, briefly stating that this is only the _th time that our Chinese scouts have celebrated the China Scout Day. Although the history is not long, the significance of the commemoration is extremely profound. We commemorate the March 15th festival and not the foreign scout festival because the Chinese scouts should express their national characteristics and not forget their mission of reviving the country and prospering the nation. Moreover, commemorating the March 15th scout festival can also represent the new life of the scouts. In the future, we should abandon the old and embrace the new, strive for the glory of the scout reputation and the development of the scout movement, and promote the scout spirit from schools to society. Then, the future of the national flag is unlimited. Fortunately, we should all encourage each other.

Cheering Slogans: Then, Commander Sun Yixin led everyone in cheering slogans: (1) Long live the scouts! (2) Long live the Shanghai scouts! (3) Long live the Chinese scouts! (4) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! (5) Long live the Republic of China! The ceremony concluded at 11 a.m., and the troops dispersed in formation amid the uplifting sounds of military music.

### Prerequisites for Implementing a Public Health System (Part Two)

— Zhu Jiqing (Speaker), Kuai Wenquan (Recorder)

3.  A Public Health System Must Be Organized: Staff members participating in the public health system should not assert their academic authority and create conflicts. They should understand and cooperate with each other, with all efforts focused on the common goal of "protecting the health of all citizens." I believe that a person cannot be measured by their level of education. Perhaps someone with a lower level of education has great abilities, and they should naturally be allowed to develop.

4.  A Public Health System Must Be Based on Academic Knowledge: Those without learning or skills will not be able to develop their work adequately. Therefore, staff members participating in the public health system must have a solid academic foundation.

5.  A Public Health System Must Be Economical: The purpose of implementing a public health system is not to make a profit, nor is it driven by charity. It is centered on economics. If we analyze the outpatient records of the Nanjing Health Office, the Central Hospital, and the Municipal Hospital, we find that there are very few serious illnesses. Most, about 90 percent, are minor illnesses that nurses can handle. It is uneconomical for a doctor to see illnesses that nurses can handle. It is more economical to have nurses treat illnesses they can handle and doctors treat illnesses nurses cannot. I will now divide diseases into three categories:

A. Self-Resolvable: With basic health knowledge, these illnesses can be resolved without a doctor's treatment.

B. Resolvable by Nurses or Assistants: For example, minor surgery.

C. Requiring a Doctor's Resolution: After being filtered through A and B, about 80 to 90 percent of the illnesses that reach doctors require their diagnosis and treatment.

6.  A Public Health System Must Meet Social Needs: Its funding comes from the people and is used for the people. Its work, scientific medicine, is delivered to every individual in the community.

How can a public health system be implemented? Let's discuss it from three aspects:

(1) Government Aspect:

(1) System Experimentation and Confirmation: Before a system is implemented in various regions, it must first be experimented in one location to avoid excessive sacrifice.

(2) Economic and Equipment Convenience: Regardless of the amount of money, some money must be allocated. Regardless of how simple the equipment is, there must be some equipment.

(3) Staff Security: Insufficient work leads to insecurity, making it difficult to advance or retreat, which reduces work efficiency. Therefore, adequate security must be provided in terms of livelihood, such as health insurance and life insurance.

(4) Maintenance of Work Interest: Those who participate in work without pay, initially with great enthusiasm, may later retreat due to difficulties. The authorities must find ways to maintain their interest, allowing it to grow with each passing day. In this way, the system's experimentation and work promotion will naturally have considerable assistance.

(5) Evaluation of Work Performance: Provide as many opportunities for advancement and academic improvement as possible, such as staff training, public training, and technical personnel training.

(2) Staff Aspect:

(1) Thorough Understanding: Unwilling to be exploited, not superficial, and not fashionable.

(2) Firm Belief: The success of the Three Principles of the People is due to the belief of the general public. The public health system can also be considered a doctrine of the medical community.

(3) Diligent Implementation: A. Not afraid of difficulties. B. Not afraid of hardship. C. Not making enemies. D. Must be selfless and impartial.

(4) Lofty Expectations: With lofty expectations, work becomes more interesting. When interest in work arises, the success of the career is more than halfway there!

(5) Academic Advancement: Advancement is based on academic knowledge, not bragging or flattery.

(3) Social Public Aspect:

(1) General Publicity: To make the people understand its purpose.

(2) Sympathy and Support from the Intellectual Community: Because their written opposition propaganda hinders our work.

Implementation Steps:

1.  Organize a "Public Health Construction" Association: not for publicity, but for implementation.

2.  Establish a "Public Health System" Experimental Province.

3.  Establish a Public Health Experimental School.

4.  Publish a "Public Health Construction" Publication as a place for intellectual exchange.

5.  Prepare for the registration and insurance of public health service personnel.

Conclusion:

My proposals for the prerequisites for a public health system are roughly as described above. I hope that all students will evaluate them, gather ideas, and work towards realizing the public health system and ensuring the health of all citizens!

### Common Knowledge of Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases

— Tang Renjin

(121) Hordeolum

Among the eyelid diseases, the most common and easily recognizable one is hordeolum, also known as a stye. Hordeola can be internal or external. Those that grow externally are called external hordeola, and those that grow internally are called internal hordeola. They are described in detail below:

(1) External Hordeolum: External hordeolum is caused by Staphylococcus aureus invading the sebaceous glands through the hair follicles of the eyelashes, resulting in acute inflammation and suppuration. It is more likely to occur in those with blepharitis or conjunctivitis. Weak, anemic women seem to be more prone to this disease and it is easily recurrent. In the early stages of the disease, one part of the eyelid becomes red, swollen, and painful. If the disease progresses, the entire eyelid becomes tense and feels heavy, making it difficult to open the eyes. Sometimes the swelling can even affect the conjunctiva of the eyeball or the face. If you press the swollen part of the eyelid with your finger, you will feel severe tenderness and can touch the hard nodule in the affected area. After a few days, a pus point appears on the skin. Once it ruptures, the pus will drain, the swelling will subside, and the pain will stop.

(2) Internal Hordeolum: Internal hordeolum is an acute suppurative inflammation of the meibomian gland. Its pathogenic bacteria are also mostly Staphylococcus aureus. The lesion of internal hordeolum is mostly in the deep part of the eyelid, so the changes on the surface of the eyelid skin are generally mild, but the pain is severe. The conjunctival surface of the eyelid becomes red and swollen, and soon a yellow pus point appears.

The treatment method for this condition is to use warm compresses as soon as it starts, which can often be naturally absorbed and dissipated. If pus points are found, a doctor should perform an incision and drainage. For those with repeated recurrences, a Staphylococcus aureus "vaccine" can be tried, which is often effective. At the same time, if you have blepharitis or conjunctivitis, you should also treat them separately.

(122) Chalazion

Chalazion is commonly known as eyelid tumor or eyelid phlegm nodule, and is said to be formed by phlegm fire. From the perspective of modern medicine, it is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the meibomian gland. A hemispherical hard nodule develops in the tarsal plate of the eyelid. It develops slowly and gradually grows larger. The surface of the eyelid skin is slightly raised. The hard nodule does not adhere to the skin, so it can be moved from the skin surface. Small ones are like rice grains, and large ones are like peas. The eyelid has no inflammatory symptoms such as redness or pain. As for the conjunctival surface of the eyelid, it is also slightly raised and appears dark red and congested. If the contents are not surgically removed, the hard nodule often ruptures from the conjunctival surface after several months or years, secreting fleshy material. Granulation sometimes occurs in the wound, or it may suppurate and rupture from the skin surface. There are also natural absorption cases, but they are few.

The treatment method for this condition is surgical removal of the contents by a doctor.

### The Relationship Between Superstitious Customs and Medicine and Their Impact on the Rural Economy

— Yang Yingzhuang

Since the implementation of the policy of governing the people with divine power in previous dynasties, the people have suffered from its poison, "no less than from floods and fierce beasts. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the government authorities have tried their best to break superstition, but because education has not been popularized and the people's knowledge is simple, the government and the people have formed a ratio of earnest exhortation to contemptuous disregard. Therefore, superstitious customs still cannot be saved even in the slightest. Not only are remote rural villages and small towns filled with superstitious colors, but even large cities and bustling ports can be found everywhere and at all times. My southeast region is known as a gathering place of culture, and it is still like this, let alone other places."

Those who are confused by superstition in their lives and engage in divine power are merely wasting money, and there is little harm to themselves. But those who are confused by superstition when they contract diseases will face imminent death. How can ignorant people, when they are sick, attribute it to ghosts and gods causing trouble? Some even disregard medicine and rely solely on seeking witches and diviners, entering temples and incense halls, and praying sincerely in the hope of averting disaster. They waste money and delay treatment, and as a result, I have seen many cases of both loss of life and property. Those who are lucky enough to survive are often impoverished. Therefore, superstitious customs have a great relationship with the development of medicine and the impact on the rural economy. Here, I will briefly describe the various superstitious actions of the people in the two counties of Zhejiang Province, Ningbo and Yantian, in relation to diseases, so as to see a glimpse of the harm caused by superstition.

(1) Sending Wild Rice

Among the superstitious actions of people who are sick and confused by ghosts and gods causing trouble, the ignorant and uneducated farmers in the countryside are the most common, followed by city dwellers. There are also some intellectuals who are surrounded by the environment and cannot avoid the common customs. When they first become ill, they perform the act of "sending wild rice," suspecting that they are possessed by wild ghosts and sending rice to dismiss them. The method is to fill several small bowls with rice, place a piece of pork on top, put them in a basket, and prepare paper ingots and hell money. A servant is ordered to carry the basket, hold incense, and go to the bedside to communicate with the gods, saying: "So-and-so is ignorant and has offended you. We have prepared a simple meal to atone for our sins. Please eat and leave." After reciting this, the servant uses the incense to make the patient breathe on it, then carries the basket out and sends it to a three-way intersection. The ingots and money are burned, the rice is poured on the side of the road, and they quietly return, thinking that the matter is over. At this time, the patient has no shadow of medical treatment in their mind.

(2) Knocking on Pig's Head

If the illness does not improve after sending wild rice, they will definitely enter the incense hall and inquire of a blind diviner. The blind diviner asks about the background of the patient, their age, and the date of onset, and then divines for them. After the divination is completed and the verdict is announced, it is mostly "knocking on the pig's head," saying that "this is not enough to appease the anger of the gods." The patient's family carefully follows the verdict and purchases a pig's head, a god statue, paper candles, silver ingots, hell money, tin foil, offerings of fruit and wine, etc. At dusk, they set up a banquet in the courtyard and hire someone who specializes in burning paper and offering sacrifices (farmers who specialize in this profession and are hired by others) to arrange the ceremony, serve wine respectfully, and sing god songs loudly. At the end of each verse, they add a rhyming gong and drum sound. The gong and drum player also sings loudly: "Good fortune come! Good profit come! The gods are happy! Blessings come!" The person who burns paper and offers sacrifices and the gong and drum player alternate in singing for about two hours before the ceremony is completed. If the disease was not serious to begin with, and the virus is cured by the body's inherent natural healing ability, they will definitely attribute it to the miraculousness of "knocking on the pig's head," and will not even consider medicine.

(3) Waiting for Half a Feast

If the illness cannot be cured in a short period of time, and there is still no improvement after "knocking on the pig's head," the patient's family often blames themselves for not being sincere enough. They will definitely invite a witch to their home to show their sincerity and thoroughness. (The witches are mostly middle-aged women suffering from Hylstaire.) When the witch arrives, she first puts on airs as if possessed by gods and ghosts, and then utters wild words. Her wording generally says: "Offended so-and-so Bodhisattva, angered so-and-so Lord," and "So-and-so yin person (referring to a female ghost) wants tin foil, so-and-so yang person (referring to a male ghost) wants hell money, so-and-so ancestor wants yellow repentance, so-and-so childless family wants a feast, the Land God is busy and also wants to be rewarded, so-and-so temple so-and-so temple must be heavily vowed..." and other absurd words. After her pronouncements, she claims that the "pig's head" was ineffective and that they must "wait for half a feast." The patient's family regards the witch as a god and dares not disobey her instructions. They immediately purchase the supplies for half a feast and hire many assistants to help with the arrangements. The ceremony is also arranged by the person who specializes in burning paper and offering sacrifices. At dusk, a feast is set up in the hall, with god statues hung high and lamps and candles shining brightly. The person who burns paper and offers sacrifices and the gong and drum player also sing back and forth like in "knocking on the pig's head," causing a noisy disturbance that lasts all night, wasting people's money and energy to the extreme.

If the patient is currently in a state of confusion and uttering nonsense, the patient's family becomes even more convinced that it is the work of evil spirits, and their superstitious actions become even more vigorous, while they remain indifferent to medicine.

If the patient has typhoid fever with prolonged illness, they will "knock on the pig's head" and "wait for half a feast" again and again, continuously indulging until they have exhausted their wealth and scraped together everything they have. Therefore, once infected, those who have no savings will be lucky if they do not die. After recovery, they will be penniless and burdened with debts.

Due to various unsanitary conditions in the inland, typhoid fever is prevalent all year round, especially rampant in autumn and winter, with widespread infections and continuous cases. Because of contracting the disease, many families are ruined. Those who delay treatment, turning minor illnesses into serious ones, and dying from serious illnesses are even more numerous.

(4) Pressing the Earth

If a part of the patient's body, such as a joint, feels severe pain, it is suspected that it was struck by the earth god, called "yin injury." If construction, tree felling, excavation, pile driving, or floating houses and graves are found near their residence or ancestral tomb, they are even more convinced that it is a sign, saying that "moving the earth has disturbed the evil direction." There is a saying among the people that "those who encounter the three evil directions will die three people," and "those who encounter the seven evil directions will die seven people." Therefore, not only the patient suffers extreme terror, but the rest of the healthy people are also panicked and anxious. They are eager to hire a geomancer (commonly known as a feng shui master) to go to the site of the earthwork to investigate and ask him to "press the earth" to seek safety. The geomancer then performs various mysterious methods of pressing the earth, completes the task, and demands a reward before leaving.

(5) Telling the Earth

Pain and illness are believed to be caused by the earth god, and medicine is not even considered. After "pressing the earth," the pain will not be relieved immediately without medical treatment. Therefore, they must follow up with "telling the earth," saying that "it is not enough to pray to the earth god for forgiveness." The hands and rituals for "telling the earth" are performed by a Taoist priest. The method is to set up a banquet at the site of the earthwork, and offer the statue of the earth god. Three or four Taoist priests walk around, and the bells, chimes, drums, and cymbals make noise all day long. The small earthwork is completed in one day, and the large earthwork must last for three days. They are deceived by heresy, disregard medicine, and scratch the surface, which is extremely foolish.

Little do they know that pain is caused by pathology and has nothing to do with the earth god. For example, there is joint pain in epidemic neuralgia, severe headache in rash typhoid, severe pain in the head and neck in meningitis, chest pain on the side in acute real pneumonia, intercostal pain in pleurisy, muscle and joint pain in rheumatism, and various neuralgias... and so on, there are many such cases. What does it have to do with the earth god?

Also, neurological symptoms during various diseases, such as coma, delirium, etc., are believed by the people to be caused by evil spirits possessing the patient because they suddenly lose their normal state. Little do they know that coma and delirium are common symptoms of feverish diseases, such as typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, rash typhoid, severe pneumonia, scarlet fever, miliary fever, septicopyemia, acute systemic miliary tuberculosis, bubonic plague, epidemic meningitis... and other infectious diseases all have coma symptoms. The reason is that various bacterial toxins stimulate the nerves in the brain. What does it have to do with ghosts and gods? To abandon the obvious and pray to the dark is extremely foolish.

The above are the most common superstitious actions of the people in relation to diseases. There are many other trivial matters, such as making vows, fulfilling vows, begging for immortal prescriptions, seeking altar prescriptions... etc., which I will not list one by one. But the few major aspects listed above are enough to show that the poison of superstition not only directly harms the lives of patients, but also indirectly affects the lifeline of the rural economy to a deep and significant degree. Therefore, if we want the medical cause to universally benefit the people and seek the revival of the rural economy, we must break their superstitious customs. If we want to break their customs, we must first take popular education and enlightenment of the people as a prerequisite, and then widely instill health culture, then we can gradually change the customs and achieve the effect of transforming customs. I hope that the ruling authorities will pay attention to this and find ways to improve it so that the people who are lost in the fog can emerge into the world of light. Then both the lives and economy of the people will benefit, and the plan for revival will have a chance of success.

### Report on Health Inspections in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, etc. (Part Five)

— Chu Jinfang

If another year passes, since both the patient and the institution will increase by one year, the patient will still be six years old, and will remain six years old forever. The rest can be inferred by analogy. If the patient comes to the institution for examination, we can check the medical history in the six-year-old system.

5.  Gaoqiao District Health Office

The office is located in Pudong, opposite Wusong, and has a long history. Its health work is most successful in maternal and child health. There is one director, two doctors, and two nurses. There are three affiliated clinics, each with one midwife and one assistant.

The annual funding is over 17,000 yuan, with 10,000 yuan subsidized by the Shanghai Medical College, 7,000 yuan allocated by the Health Bureau, and several thousand or several hundred yuan from local donations and outpatient income.

The registration method at the clinic is based on each patient's family as a unit, which is more complicated. It is said that only 100 people can be registered every two hours. Fortunately, there are not many outpatients every day, otherwise, it would be difficult to cope.

The midwives at the clinic are able to work hard on maternal and child health, in addition to delivering babies, prenatal examinations, and postpartum visits. Although it is located in a rural area and boats and horses cannot travel smoothly, the clinic has a "one-wheel bright moon" (i.e., a unicycle) for actively promoting maternal and child health. The car is specially equipped with boxes and chairs to facilitate riding and carrying medicines and equipment to work in various villages.

6.  Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital

The hospital was established three years ago and is located on Tongji Road, the former site of the China Public Hospital. The annual funding is more than 40,000 yuan. There are more than 80 beds, one director, two resident doctors, one visiting doctor, and several nurses. The inpatient fees are eight yuan per day for the first class, four yuan for the second class, and six jiao for the third class. The business has not been very developed. There are currently only more than 20 inpatients, mostly with diphtheria.

The hospital's kitchen has two sections, ordinary and special. The ordinary kitchen is for general infectious disease patients and is specially constructed. After use, the tableware is sent to the disinfection room for boiling disinfection and then placed in the wall cabinet. The disinfection room is separated from another room for cooking and serving food. The wall cabinet is located between the two rooms, and the sterilized utensils in the wall cabinet are used to fill and serve food to prevent the spread of diseases. The special kitchen is for patients with infectious diseases who cannot use ordinary food (such as those with kidney disease, diabetes, etc.). A nurse is specially responsible for management. However, the ordinary kitchen is operated by cooks. It would be better to add a nurse to be responsible for management.

According to the habits of the citizens, people who visit patients in the hospital are free to enter and exit without much restriction. However, the situation in infectious disease hospitals is different from that in ordinary hospitals. It seems that restrictions should be strictly enforced and preventive measures should be taken to avoid infection.

The Health Bureau has a plan to build nine new houses, intending to separately accommodate patients with various statutory infectious diseases to seek complete isolation and to facilitate diagnosis and treatment. Two houses have been built to accommodate patients with various infectious diseases. In the future, when the other seven houses are built, they will be accommodated separately according to the original plan. This method is well-intentioned, but in fact, it may not be very economical.

7.  HubNorth District Health Office

The construction project of the office site has been completed, and only outpatients can be treated at present. All internal equipment is not yet complete.

8.  Municipal HubNorth Drug Rehabilitation Hospital

The hospital was established in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) and is located on Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei. It has 250 beds, and currently has more than 80 addicts. The staff includes one director, one doctor, one head nurse, seven nurses, one pharmacist, and three clerks. The monthly operating expense is 1,700 yuan. Inpatient fees are waived. Addicts are sent by the Public Security Bureau and those who voluntarily seek rehabilitation are not accepted. Upon admission, they must take a bath, get a haircut, and weigh themselves. They must also change into specially prepared clothes. The hospital has entertainment places for addicts and is equipped with a wireless radio. Each ward is equipped with a radio speaker to relieve boredom. There are also several intensive care units for addicts who also suffer from other serious diseases.

The method of rehabilitation is to use the blistering method. It is said that on average, they can quit in two weeks and increase their weight by several pounds upon discharge. The method is as follows:

Mix 15 cc each of pure ammonia and 10% camphor oil, and then immerse it on a 5-square-centimeter eight-layer thick sterilized gauze, cover it on the head. After one or two minutes, the chest will feel tingling. After about twenty to forty minutes, small blisters will appear on the skin, and the tingling will gradually lessen. When the small blisters swell to two centimeters in circumference, remove the gauze, replace it with a hot water compress, and change it continuously. After another one or two hours, the small blisters gradually merge into one large blister. When the blister is transparent, perform a fluid extraction operation (about 2 cc to 8 cc), and inject the extracted blister fluid into the buttocks. After the blister fluid is extracted, apply mercury pigment ointment to cover the wound.

### Domestically Produced Medicinal Plants (Continued)

— Zhou Mengbai

4.  Ligustrum Japonicum, Thunb.

(Plant) It grows naturally in the wild and can also be cultivated. It is a small evergreen tree. The leaves have petioles, are leathery, and are oval or elliptical in shape, completely green, with acutely pointed tips. Terminal panicles bear small white funnel-shaped flowers in summer. The drupes are oblong, turning purplish-black when ripe.

(Crude Drug) Fructus Ligustri refers to the dried fruit of the plant after it has been harvested.

(Constituents) The leaves and bark contain the glycosides Syringin C17H24O9 and Emulsin. Syringin is hydrolyzed as follows:

C17H24O9 + H2O = C11H14O4 + C6H12O6

Syringin Methoxyconiferyl alcohol Glucose

(Medicinal Use) Traditional texts state that the fruit is a tonic. A decoction of the leaves, applied hot to swellings, is effective.

Fruit: Strengthens the middle energizer, calms the five viscera, nourishes the spirit, eliminates hundreds of diseases, long-term consumption makes one robust and light, and prevents aging.

Leaves: Treats dizziness, various malignant sores and swellings, and ulcers of the lower leg; for chronic cases, decoct in water and apply hot.

Styraceae

1.  Styrax Japonica, Sieb. et Zucc.

(Plant) It grows naturally in the mountains and fields, and is a deciduous tree. The leaves have petioles, are oval in shape, with finely serrated margins and acuminate tips. Axillary racemes hang down with 3-5 flowers, bearing long-stalked white flowers in early summer. The drupes are broadly elliptical, splitting open when ripe.

(Constituents) The pericarp contains about 4% of crystalline Egcsaponin C61H96O26. This Saponin is hydrolyzed by the action of acid as follows:

C61H92O28 + 4H2O = C37H58O7 + 2CH12O6 + C6H10O7 + C6H12O5

Egosaponin Egosapogenin Glucose Glucuronic acid Rhamnose

The seeds contain about 45% fatty oil, the main components of which are Glycerides of Palmitic acid, Stearic acid, and Linoleic acid.

(Uses) Fresh pericarp can be used for washing. Also, squeezing the juice into streams can be used to catch fish. The wood can be used to make the pulleys of umbrellas.

### City Government's Expanded Commemoration Week Report: Shanghai Festival to Institute Etiquette; Mayor Wu Presents Medals to Concession Police Officers

March 21st Designated as Shanghai Festival to Reform Customs; Mayor Wu Presents Medals on Behalf of the Interior Ministry to Police Officers in the Concession

The Shanghai Municipal Government held an expanded commemoration week yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the City Hall Auditorium. A ceremony was also held to present medals to Yang En, Deputy Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police of the Public Concession, and Robson, Chief of the Detective Division. Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, Director Pan, Director Xu, Director Shen, and hundreds of officials from various bureaus attended. Details are as follows:

Explaining the Shanghai Festival: The expanded commemoration week began with Mayor Wu reporting on the significance of the Shanghai Festival. The original text is as follows: Since ancient times, reforming customs and changing traditions has been a difficult and challenging task for both the government and society. Of the customs, those that are good, we should of course retain and promote. Those that are not good and violate the spirit of the times, we should of course eliminate. Looking at the history of China and foreign countries, whenever a country undergoes reform, it must go through a major movement of changing customs and traditions, that is, the so-called revolution must first reform the heart. If our thinking is very outdated, how can we adapt to modern life and how can we build a modern country and a modern society? This is of course impossible. The Chinese revolution has been going on for decades, and the Republic of China has been established for twenty-six years. Our party has been in power for nearly ten years. However, regarding the movement to change customs and traditions, although the government and the party have been continuously striving to promote it, it has not yet been thoroughly reformed. Taking Shanghai as an example, Shanghai used to have several temple fairs every year. The central government has repeatedly ordered us to ban them, but the ban is the ban, and the fairs are still held. There is no way to completely eliminate them. What is the reason for this? If those of us who are implementing the orders do not study the root cause and only know to issue a notice to ban them when we receive a government order, then naturally the ban is the ban, and the fairs are still held. We should never hope that it will be thoroughly eliminated one day. I believe that to eliminate an old, bad, and harmful custom, we must first promote a new, good, and beneficial custom to replace it and drive it away. Then that old, bad, and harmful custom can be fundamentally and thoroughly eliminated. The citizens of Shanghai spend a lot of money every year to hold temple fairs that cause a sensation throughout the city. Although temple fairs violate the spirit of the times, they were not entirely meaningless in the past. This is a relic from the agricultural economy and the era of theocracy in ancient times. At that time, the common people worked very hard all year round, busy with farming. At a certain time, everyone would come together to be happy and rest, holding the so-called temple fairs to seek a day of fun. This is indeed excusable. However, holding temple fairs now is no longer in line with the modern spirit of the times. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Government has repeatedly received orders from the government to ban these temple fairs in order to break the superstition of the people. After the municipal government received the order, it issued a notice to ban them every time, but the fairs were still held as usual. Therefore, we must now think of a good way to implement the government's orders. What we consider to be a good way is to designate a day as Shanghai Festival and remove all the superstitious and bad behaviors that are not in line with the spirit of the times from the past temple fairs in Shanghai. We are preparing to hold a competition on the Shanghai Festival, but this competition has a very deep meaning and is in line with the spirit of the times. We want to use this Shanghai Festival to promote industry, agriculture, commerce, and education, to encourage citizens to be dedicated to their work, to be sociable, to be kind, to unite, to help each other, to cooperate, to develop, to produce, to be lively, to be optimistic, to be enterprising, and to have various other spirits and emotions. With this spirit and emotion, we want to make the entire Shanghai society and every individual have a thriving atmosphere, so that the farmers, workers, merchants, and students in Shanghai can all develop equally. We will use this new custom to replace and reform the theocratic and superstitious temple fair custom. The reason why the Shanghai Municipal Council suggested designating March 21 as Shanghai Festival is because March 21 is the day when the National Revolutionary Army recovered Shanghai, the day when the forces of the National Revolution entered the gate of Shanghai, and the day when the new national consciousness of Shanghai was born. Moreover, March 21 is in the spring, when the spring is bright. It is very appropriate to hold Shanghai Festival on that day. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council has designated March 21 of each year as the day of Shanghai Festival. This year is the first year. Because of insufficient preparation, it cannot be held on a large scale. However, this year is a year to encourage and promote Shanghai Festival. We will do our best to hold it within the possible range. In my personal opinion, our promotion of Shanghai Festival has various meanings and spirits such as encouraging industry, agriculture, commerce, and education. Then, when we hold it, we must ensure that it is in line with these meanings and spirits. Therefore, I would like to hold an agricultural product exhibition in Jiangwan every year when Shanghai Festival is held to encourage farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai to work hard to improve production and increase production. I would like to hold a handicraft exhibition in Zhabei, because we have not yet broken away from the handicraft era. Most of our people still use their hands to produce and make a living. Therefore, I would like to hold a handicraft exhibition to promote the development of handicrafts. The form is similar to the temporary market near Jing'an Temple in Shanghai during the annual Buddha bathing festival. At the same time, I would like to hold an education exhibition in the Nanshi area, planning to exhibit and reward the handicrafts made by students during their vacations. Secondly, I would like to hold a flower exhibition in Pudong or Caohejing, but I do not know whether this time is appropriate. Although Shanghai Festival is only one day, these exhibitions can be held for several days in a row, or even extended to a week. This is a bit of my personal opinion, and I would like to contribute it to all comrades and the Shanghai Festival Preparatory Committee for reference. In short, our promotion of Shanghai Festival has very far-reaching significance. We don't have to look far away. We only need to look at Little Luzon in the South Seas, which holds carnivals every year. Japan also has a cherry blossom festival every year, and San Francisco in the United States and Spain also have grape festivals every year. All of these are meaningful. In the future, the officials of the Shanghai Municipal Government must redouble their efforts to promote and implement it in order to change customs and traditions. Changing customs and traditions is a pioneer and a forerunner in our Chinese reform movement. This is what I want to add to all comrades today.

Medal Presentation Ceremony: The medal presentation ceremony was held next. Mayor Wu, on behalf of the Ministry of Interior, presented gold medals to Yang En, Deputy Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police of the Public Concession, and Robson, Chief of the Detective Division, and delivered a speech saying that today, China is awarding the highest medal to police officers of the Public Concession. Commissioner Yang and Inspector Robson have served in the Public Concession for many years, and have achieved many merits and honors in their duties. More than 90 percent of the residents of the Public Concession are Chinese, and the power of the Public Concession's security and protection is really not small. Commissioner Yang and Inspector Robson also made special contributions, namely, the case of Minister Song being assassinated at the North Railway Station six years ago. Therefore, the Chinese government is particularly grateful for the merits of these two gentlemen and for solving the Song case. Today, the Chinese government specially presents them with medals and wishes them good health.

### Shanghai Federation of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Negotiate the Treatment of Overseas Chinese in South Africa

Implementation of the Residency Law Primarily Targets Overseas Chinese; Order General Consul Zhang to Expediently Negotiate a Solution with South Africa

The National Federation of Commerce of this city telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, we have received a letter from Cen Xin-yi and Liang Ci-kuang, representatives of the overseas Chinese in the Transvaal Province of South Africa who have returned home to petition. The letter states that the overseas Chinese compatriots in the Transvaal Federation government are being treated harshly and their suffering is deepening day by day. The representatives have been dispatched to return home to appeal on all fronts, and they are grateful for your association's full support in requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to accept their plight and to quickly conclude a reciprocal commercial treaty with the Transvaal Federation to seek a fundamental solution. Recently, it has been reported that the Transvaal Federation government has begun to implement the Residency Law, making it difficult for overseas Chinese and not issuing business licenses. If we do not quickly submit to negotiations and proceed with the treaty, we fear that our overseas Chinese will be the first to be suppressed. Therefore, we urge your association to forward this to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and to telegraph General Consul Zhang Shoumo to urgently negotiate with the Transvaal Federation government to temporarily suspend the Residency Law for overseas Chinese, pending the conclusion of a commercial treaty to seek a proper solution, thereby saving the crisis and safeguarding the overseas Chinese industry. This would be a great kindness. In addition, we have received a joint letter from the Transvaal Overseas Chinese Preparatory Committee, the Transvaal Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Pretoria Overseas Chinese Association, the Pretoria Overseas Chinese Youth Autonomous Association, and the Academic Affairs Committee of the Pretoria Overseas Chinese Public School, the representatives of overseas Chinese in Africa attending the National Assembly. The letter states that our overseas Chinese compatriots have suffered terribly due to various harsh treatments and oppressions by the Transvaal Federation government. Therefore, the various organizations and our association have jointly appointed Mr. Cen Xin-yi and Mr. Liang Ci-kuang to return home to petition the central government to quickly negotiate with the South African government to remove the harsh regulations, and to appeal to all sectors of society. All details, in addition to the reports by the two representatives, are specially certified in this letter. We beg for your earnest assistance, and the overseas Chinese compatriots will be grateful. On this basis, we should telegraph your ministry for examination and approval, and we earnestly request that you forward an order to the resident General Consul Zhang to quickly negotiate with the Transvaal Federation government to seek a solution, which is of utmost importance. Respectfully, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce of the Republic of China, bowed and stamped."

### City Lowered Flags Yesterday to Mourn the Martyrs of the Suiyuan Campaign

A Moment of Silence Observed for Three Minutes During Commemoration Week

Yesterday was the memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War. All government agencies, party headquarters at all levels, organizations, schools, factories, businesses, and residents throughout the city lowered their flags in mourning. Yesterday was also Wednesday, so party headquarters at all levels, government agencies, schools, and other institutions observed a moment of silence for three minutes during the weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen to mourn the military and civilians who died in the Suiyuan Campaign.

### Current Events

Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, accompanied by Zou Lin and Xu Kan, Vice Ministers of Finance, took the night express train to Nanjing last night at 11:00 PM to preside over the Executive Yuan's routine meeting this morning. Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, Zeng Zhongming, Deputy Secretary-General, Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Chen Yi, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, and Central Committee Member Chuan Ru-lin also took the night express train to Nanjing last night.

Niu Yongjian, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, took the express train to Nanjing yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM.

### Selection of Special Envoy to Attend the Coronation of the British Monarch

A Decision Can Be Made Within Days; Kong Still Preparing

Although it has been internally decided that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, will decline the position of special envoy to attend the coronation ceremony of the British monarch, the official announcement has not yet been made. Kong himself has long expressed his willingness to make the trip abroad and has purchased a ticket for the Italian postal ship Victoria, which departs on April 2. He has also been preparing gifts to present to the British monarch. However, rumors have been circulating in recent days that Kong has canceled his trip to England. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with Kong's staff about the truth and learned that Kong himself is still preparing to go to England. However, Kong's staff and the business community believe that Kong has important responsibilities in China's financial and political affairs and should not leave the country hastily. Therefore, they have advised him to give up the idea. Now that President Jiang has returned to Nanjing, a final decision can be made within days. As for the gifts to the British monarch, Kong believed that the four pieces of Hunan embroidery that he had previously purchased were unsuitable and had returned them. It was also rumored that Kong had purchased 25 pieces of jade from the jade exhibition to present to the British monarch. However, this news is inaccurate.

### The Sealing Off of Yu Gucun May Have a Chance for Resolution

The Returned Donation is of Unknown Significance; Such Actions Infringe Upon Our National Sovereignty

A Third Party to Act as Mediator

Since Yu Gucun, located in the area of the unauthorized road construction, was sealed off by the Public Concession's Public Works Department under the pretext of unpaid police donations, residents have experienced great difficulties. Recently, some residents have submitted police donations to the Public Works Department, but the department has returned them all, refusing to accept them. Therefore, residents do not understand the purpose of the Public Works Department's actions. If the Public Works Department insists on this incomprehensible attitude, they will resort to legal action to seek a solution. It is rumored that the Public Works Department has expressed its apologies to residents who have paid their police donations. Therefore, a third party will act as a mediator to resolve the matter as soon as possible.

The Ratepayers' Association Raises Three Questions

The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Chairman of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "To the Chairman of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Public Works Department of your bureau has sealed off Yu Gucun in the jurisdiction of the city police bureau under the pretext that the owners of the village have signed a contract to pay municipal general donations for unauthorized road construction, avoiding legal litigation, and obstructing the safety of residents by blocking traffic, in order to achieve the purpose of fully collecting municipal general donations. Regarding the issue of unauthorized road construction, there is a political solution. Regarding whether the contract is valid, there is a legal principle to explain, which is unnecessary to repeat. However, what needs to be studied is whether this major action, firstly, was approved by your board of directors or automatically authorized; secondly, whether the donations collected by this action are sufficient to cover all the expenses of your bureau; and thirdly, how much public goodwill your bureau has gained by this action. In any case, all people with common sense are afraid that this action will give the impression of infringing upon our Chinese sovereignty. For the sake of protecting the reputation of your bureau's rule of law and safety, we hereby protest. What to do, how to proceed, is up to your chairman to choose." Addressed to the Chairman of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession.

### Silk Weaving Industry Strike Wave Spreads; Guild Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday

Social Affairs Bureau to Mediate Mei Ya Dispute Today; Heng Feng and Other Factories Negotiating on Their Own and Approaching Resolution

Following the spread of the silk weaving worker strike wave, the Silk Weaving Factory Owners' Guild, deeply concerned about further escalation, has scheduled an extraordinary general meeting for tomorrow to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday morning, they first held an emergency meeting of the executive committee, allowing the bureau to decide to conduct mediation of the Mei Ya Silk and Cotton dispute at two o'clock this morning. Detailed information is recorded below:

Guild Convenes Emergency Meeting The Shanghai Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Owners' Guild convened an emergency executive committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss how to deal with the factory situation. Chairman Cai Sheng-bai stood up to report, stating that the silk weaving industry has been in distress for several years due to environmental factors. The cost of production is high, and sales are extremely difficult. Domestically, rural bankruptcy has led to a decline in purchasing power, and the dumping of tax-evading raw silk and woven goods has made competition unbearable. Internationally, high tariff barriers in various countries and inconvenient transportation have further reduced foreign trade. Feeling hesitant and frustrated, they have been striving to maintain the livelihoods of workers. Fortunately, last year's good harvest in rural areas slightly improved the market, but high silk prices made price adjustments difficult. Even with meager profits, it was not only less than the profit expectations of the general public but also difficult to recover from the old wounds of previous years. Workers, failing to understand this, abruptly proposed wage increases without following legal procedures, which is illegal. Guild members have requested assistance in how to handle this situation, and it is requested that this be discussed. Representatives from the factories involved in the strike reported on the dates of the worker strikes, as well as instances of workers assaulting factory personnel, damaging factory materials, and coercing the signing of agreements. They reiterated their sincere request for assistance. After detailed discussion, the following results were achieved: ㊀ A decision was made to convene an emergency general meeting of all members tomorrow (the 17th) to discuss countermeasures; ㊁ A request will be submitted to the Party and government to: A) immediately stop the strikes; B) declare invalid any contract conditions signed under coercion by workers; C) refuse any further consideration of the workers' proposed conditions if they do not resume work; D) any conditions proposed by workers should be submitted to the Party and government for forwarding to the guild for consultation; ㊂ Members are notified that if conditions are proposed or a strike occurs, they should first report to the guild for compilation and submission to the Party and government for uniform handling to avoid discrepancies. Do not handle matters rashly on your own.

Guild Notice of Extraordinary Meeting The Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Owners' Guild issued an emergency notice yesterday stating: ㊀ It has recently been observed that labor disputes frequently occur among member factories, leading to prolonged stalemates and losses for both labor and management, as well as affecting public order. The focus of these disputes is the amount of wages. Therefore, members have differing opinions on whether wages should be increased or decreased, and to what extent. Improper handling can easily lead to misunderstandings, further complicating matters. Several members who have suffered strike-related losses have reported difficulties in handling the situation and requested assistance. An emergency executive committee meeting was convened and resolved that, in addition to convening an emergency general meeting to discuss detailed measures, all members should report any strike incidents to the guild for compilation and submission to the Party and government for legal handling, so as to establish fair standards and achieve uniform wages, ensuring that neither labor nor management suffers unfair burdens and that both can coexist and prosper. Members should not handle matters rashly on their own to avoid misunderstandings. This notice is issued. ㊁ The guild, noting the recent frequent labor disputes among member factories and the potential for escalation, convened an emergency executive committee meeting and resolved to hold an extraordinary general meeting at 1:00 PM on the 17th of this month (i.e., Wednesday) at the Yi Hall, 6th floor of the Pudong Native Place Association at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, to discuss countermeasures for labor disputes. This matter concerns everyone's vital interests, so please attend on time to jointly devise a plan. This notice is of utmost importance.

Social Affairs Bureau Has Begun Mediation Regarding the case of silk weaving workers demanding improved treatment, Party and government agencies are making every effort to mediate. In addition to Lao Mei Feng, Da Mei Feng Jin Sheng, Tian Cheng Wu Ji, Ping Ping, and other factories, which have resolved their issues one after another, the Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a meeting with labor and management representatives at 1:00 PM today to mediate the Mei Ya Tenth and Second Factory strike case. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a meeting with labor and management representatives at 1:00 PM on the 17th to mediate the case of the Xin Yu County Weaving Factory in Huade Road, Eastern Shanghai, which has suspended operations. The case of workers at the Heng Feng Silk Factory in Yangshupu proposing terms was directly negotiated by the Fourth District Silk Weaving Workers' Union and the factory yesterday and is approaching resolution.

### China and Communications Banks Decide to Expand Agricultural Loans by 20 Million Yuan This Year

Rescuing the Rural Economy and Protecting Industry and Commerce

In recent years, the banking sector in this city has been quite active in injecting funds into the rural economy, with significant results. Last year, due to the stability of public bonds and the decline in real estate, more attention was paid to the development of agricultural loans, and the amount of loans issued was more than in the previous year. This year, China Bank and Communications Bank have decided to continue their efforts, doubling their investment to directly benefit farmers and develop the national economy. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency has investigated the details and recorded them as follows:

China Bank's Agricultural Loans Reach 16 Million Yuan Farmers account for eight out of ten people in our country, and the revival of the rural economy is closely related to industry and commerce. Last year's good harvests in various places also led to surpluses in industry and commerce, and thus banks in various places followed the government's intention to rescue the rural economy and released urban capital to rural areas. In one year, the total amount of agricultural loans nationwide was about 30 million yuan. A reporter inquired at the Bank of China and learned that the bank's rural loans last year amounted to 8 million yuan, which were widely distributed to cooperatives in Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other provinces. The collection results were very good. This year, the bank decided to double the amount of loans, with a target of 16 million yuan, to develop the rural economy and indirectly protect industry and commerce.

Communications Bank Also Doubles Agricultural Loans As for the Bank of Communications, it made about 3 million yuan in agricultural loans last year. Due to the good collection results and the needs of farmers, the amount of loans will also be doubled this year, with a target of 6 million yuan. The agricultural cooperative loans it undertakes are divided into five categories: credit loans, production loans, transportation and sales loans, consumer loans, and supply loans. All of these loans are directly provided to agricultural cooperatives organized by farmers in order to reduce the interest burden on farmers. Recently, the Bank of China has decided to expand agricultural loans in Jiangxi to 2 million yuan, and the Bank of Communications has expanded them to 1.5 million yuan. Zhejiang Province and other provinces will also be expanded. In addition, other major banks such as China Agricultural Bank, Shanghai Bank, and the Four Banks also have expansion plans.

In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Brenan, Yang Hu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, Yu Hongjun, secretary-general of the municipal government, Cai Zengji, director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and prominent figures from all walks of life, including Xu Xinliu, Wu Liande, Mr. and Mrs. Bei Zuyi, Shi Changnian, Mrs. Gu Weijun, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Judge Masoff of the British Consular Court, Chief Customs Officer Mellon, and MacDonald, director of the Public Works Department, were invited to attend. Mayor Wu stood up and delivered a speech, saying that he felt very reluctant to say goodbye to Sir Brenan, who had served in China for nearly 20 years and was admired by all who knew him. He recalled that he met Sir Brenan in Guangzhou 12 years ago and felt that he was very sympathetic to the Chinese people, had a broad vision, and was kind to others. Five years ago, when he came to Shanghai as mayor, he was happy to meet Sir Brenan again, and his respect for him deepened. He said that the resolution of the Shanghai War in 1932 was largely due to Sir Brenan's efforts, and that the friendship between Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai had become more harmonious, and the cooperation between the municipal government and the authorities of various countries had become closer. All of these were due to Sir Brenan's contributions, which would not be forgotten. He then raised his glass to wish Sir Brenan good health. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 9 o'clock.

In the past, Shanghai has received support from all walks of life and achieved excellent results. Mr. Wang Xiaolai has worked hard to lead, and he hopes to continue to promote the spirit of the past. Today, he asked everyone to come to discuss the plan for the aviation construction movement in the city and hopes to develop as many insights as possible. Then, General Secretary Li Dachao reported on the work situation, and an on-the-spot discussion was held. 1.

### Kowloon Residents' Representatives and Lu Zhang Went to Nanjing Last Night

Planning to Request Negotiations with the Central Authorities Regarding the Manchurian Government's Forced Demolition of Civilian Houses and Official Residences

Because the Hong Kong government violated the agreement and forcibly occupied Kowloon City, demolishing the old government offices and strictly limiting the residents of the entire city to demolish and cede their houses, causing unrest among the residents, Lu Zhang, the representative of the residents who was elected to petition the government for negotiations, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a month ago.

### Conflict Between Lamp-Watching Workers and Security Guards at Luhu Bridge

Two Workers Injured; Perpetrators Handed Over to Police Station

—Security Team Denies Involvement—

Around 8 PM on January 27th, at the Luhu Bridge in Zhenru, a group of workers went to the Qin Gong Temple to watch the lanterns. Due to the large crowds, security team members intervened, leading to a dispute. The security team members brandished their guns and fired several shots into the air, injuring one worker. Afterwards, the workers reported the incident to the Zhenru Police Station, which requested the security team to hand over the responsible members. The security team responded with a letter denying any wrongdoing, claiming that after thoroughly checking their member roster, they found no one involved in the incident. Yesterday, the police station detained the family members of the perpetrators and the director of the security team's branch post. The director of the branch post was later bailed out by a Zhenru municipal committee member. The remaining individuals involved were sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. The public sentiment is recorded as follows:

Lantern-Watching Incident: On the evening of February 27th, around 8 PM, workers Cao Xinchang (Ningbo native, 18 years old), Zhao Xianlin (Zhenjiang native, 27 years old), Chen Jiaxian (Wuxi native, 45 years old), and others from the Hongsheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Zhenru's Yangjiabang went to the Luhu Bridge Qin Gong Temple to watch the lanterns. On the way, due to the crowds, security team members, including Ma Lian'gen (originally surnamed Jin but changed due to inheritance), intervened to maintain order. Somehow, a disturbance broke out, leading to a fight and several gunshots. As a result, workers Cao Xinchang and Tang Daozhen were injured. The workers were taken to the security team headquarters, where Jin Zhuolun, the director of the branch post, mediated and resolved the case.

Reporting to the Police to Investigate the Culprit: Later, the workers reported the incident to the Zhenru Police Station, requesting the apprehension of the security team member Ma Lian'gen. The police station sent a letter to the security team inquiring about the matter. The security team responded, claiming that the worker's lantern-watching incident involved a fight with Zhu Goudi, a night soil worker from Xujiaxiang, and had been resolved through mediation, unrelated to the security team. They also stated that after thoroughly checking their roster, there was no one named Ma Lian'gen. The police station then sent officers to arrest Ma Lian'gen, but he had already fled in fear of punishment. Only Ma's family members, Ma A'chang (aka Jin Shunyu, 48 years old), Jin Ge氏 (51 years old), and the director of the branch post, Jin Zhuolun, were detained for questioning. Jin was later bailed out by Zhenru municipal committee member Hong Lanxiang. After briefly questioning Ma A'chang and others, they were sent to the bureau for interrogation yesterday afternoon.

Cause of the Incident: The injured workers, Cao Xinchang and Tang Daozhen, were taken to the Qu Zhibu Hospital in the South City for treatment, where their injuries were deemed quite serious. The hospital issued injury certificates. As for the cause of the incident, according to the workers, Ma Lian'gen had an affair with a female worker named A'xiang from the Hongsheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. He had once trespassed into the factory to harass her, provoking public outrage and leading to his expulsion. Ma took the opportunity to retaliate when the workers left the factory to watch the lanterns, causing the incident. However, members of the security team denied these claims.

### Arrest for Buying Copper Coins, Released After Bribing Police

Qiu A'wu Charged with Two Offenses

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, near Shangcai Road in Zhabei, a Ningbo native named Qiu A'wu (38 years old, residing at No. 31 Zhouyou Road, Hongkou) was buying copper coins with legal tender. He had already collected 295,000 coins, packed into seven wooden boxes, and was planning to take them away. Constable Cai Shuyin from the Taojiawan Road No. 29 post of the Hongzhen Sub-Bureau was patrolling the area and found the situation suspicious. He approached to investigate, but Qiu allegedly bribed him with two yuan in legal tender. Constable Cai was unmoved and took Qiu, along with the seven boxes of copper coins, to the precinct. After interrogation by Inspector He Xiao, Qiu claimed that his elder sister ran the Yichang Cigarette Exchange Shop, so he was buying copper coins and would never buy them for a foreign country to smuggle them out. Inspector He then transferred the case to the Linping Road Police Station, considering the case involved the export of copper coins, which was strictly prohibited, and bribery of a police officer. He prepared a document to be sent to the bureau for investigation.

### Regardless of Whether Virgin or Prostitute, Sexual Assault of a Minor is a Crime

Wang Quanlin Accused of Raping Zhu A'mao

Zhu Youlin, a native of Zhenhai, Ningbo, residing at No. 29 Lane 3, Ailaige Road, Chujiaqiao in the French Concession, has a second daughter named Zhu A'mao, 16 years old. On May 23rd of the previous year, when A'mao was not yet 14 years old, Wang Quanlin (41 years old), a local residing at No. 228 Fulvli Road, often visited Zhu's house. He took the opportunity to lure Zhu A'mao to the Far Eastern Hotel and raped her in room 218. Although Zhu A'mao followed her elder sister Chen Zhu氏 into prostitution in Chujiaqiao, which is part of Hanzhuang, the prosecutor believes that whether she is a virgin or a prostitute is irrelevant to the crime of rape. Raping someone under 14 years old is still a crime, so he prosecuted under Article 221, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday, Judge Lu opened the court. Attorney Yuan Guyan demanded 5,600 yuan in consolation money and requested a postponement for further investigation.

### Clues in the Double Homicide Case at Tanjiabang; Four People Arrested

The Deceased Were Father and Son Named Zhao; Hao Brothers Suspected and Fled

Previously, this newspaper reported that two male corpses, approximately 40-50 years old, with four or five knife wounds on their heads, were found by the riverbank west of the Sheng Gong Hui Cemetery, under the jurisdiction of the Tanjiabang Police Station of the Zhabei New Zha Sub-Bureau. It is now known that the responsible personnel of the police station in charge of the case have taken it very seriously. Yesterday, they arrested Mao Bu喜, Yan Guan榮, Li Ming仁, and Mao Miao氏, four men and women, and confiscated two knives, a cleaver and a kitchen knife, with bloodstains. Mao Bu喜 had built five thatched huts in the area, one for his own residence and the others rented to the Zhao, Hao, and Zhang families. The Zhao family, a father and son, moved in in March of the previous year, earning a living by selling cigarettes. They were related to the Hao family, who were two brothers. The Zhang family was a stonemason. On the afternoon of January 29th of the lunar calendar, the elder Hao brother left home with a friend named Chen. The hut owner, Mao Bu喜, asked the Hao brothers why the Zhao father and son hadn't come home for lunch. The Hao brothers replied that the Zhao family had returned to Jiangbei. The next morning, after the bodies were discovered, the Hao brothers fled suspiciously and have not returned. Therefore, there is strong suspicion against them. Yesterday, the Tanjiabang Police Station, in addition to arresting Mao Bu喜 and the other three and confirming that the deceased were the Zhao father and son, also found a bloody kitchen knife in the Zhao family's hut. The case has been transferred to the News Sub-Bureau, which has interrogated the suspects. As the case involves a major crime, it has been transferred to the Third Section of the Police Headquarters for investigation.

### Verdict in the American Eastern Bank Bond Case

Repayment Divided into Classes A and B; Distribution Expected in Early April

The liquidation of the American Eastern Bank has recently been adjudicated by Chief Judge Hillmer of the American Court in China. The creditors were divided into Class A and Class B, totaling 958 accounts. 73 accounts were classified as Class A, and the rest as Class B. The total amount involved in Class A is approximately US$139,000, representing the value of securities pledged to the American Eastern Bank that were improperly used by the bank. Class A debts should be repaid first, after deducting 8% for liquidation fees. At the same time, 20% of the Class B debts should be repaid. If creditors disagree with the classification or the amount of repayment, they can file an objection with the American Court within 20 days of receiving the notification. Otherwise, the liquidator will distribute the funds to each account. The company owes creditors approximately 3.85 million Chinese dollars. The amount ordered to be paid by the American Court is approximately 3.13 million Chinese dollars. Since the start of liquidation, the liquidator has collected approximately 1.35 million Chinese dollars owed to the company. The total amount to be paid to Class A creditors and the first 20% to Class B creditors is approximately 1.025 million Chinese dollars. It is expected that the distributions will be made around April 10th. Future collections will be distributed to Class B creditors.

### Niece-in-Law Accuses Paternal Uncle of Embezzlement

Defendant Claims Fabrication Due to Personal Animosity

Guo Ma氏, a 36-year-old woman from Chaoyang, residing upstairs at No. 8 Yunheli, Laobeidou, near Attorney Teng Lanren, sued her paternal uncle Guo Ruichen (60 years old, residing at Guo Baofeng Store, Yuanheli) in the local court, accusing him of embezzling her savings. The lawsuit alleges that the plaintiff had a savings of 2,900 legal tender dollars at the Guo Yuanmao North Store, with a passbook as proof. In the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the plaintiff returned to her hometown and entrusted the passbook to her paternal uncle (the defendant), Guo Ruichen, to collect interest and remit the money home. However, the defendant, after being entrusted with the passbook, did not do so. Despite repeated letters from the plaintiff, there was no response. Last year, the plaintiff had no choice but to abandon her family affairs and come to Shanghai to negotiate with the defendant. At first, he prevaricated, and then he avoided meeting. After investigation, it was learned that the defendant had withdrawn all the principal and interest from Guo Yuanmao North Store. Yesterday, Judge Chen tried the case. The defendant claimed that the lawsuit was a complete fabrication due to personal animosity. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation.

### Closing Arguments in the Water Heater Explosion Case

Verdict on the 22nd

On the morning of the 18th, around 6 AM, a water heater in the basement of the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road exploded due to improper firing, killing Zhu Fenglan and Pan Weihan. After investigation by Inspector Gao Zhen of the General Police Station, it was determined that the fireman Xu Zulin was at fault and he was arrested and detained by the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in the criminal court. Attorney Ru BaoYi of the police station stated that the police had previously found two experts to testify that the defendant had forgotten to open the damper before firing the heater, leading to the disaster. However, for the sake of caution, they had found another expert, an engineer named Klemens from the Public Works Department of the Department of Labor. According to his assessment, the defendant's failure to open the damper was indeed his fault. However, water heaters should also have a safety valve in addition to the damper. If this safety valve was installed, even if the damper was not opened, an explosion would not have been possible. The water heater in the bank did not have this safety device, which somewhat benefited the defendant. Then, witness Yao A'er testified that he and the deceased Pan Weihan were trash collectors. The deceased was sweeping coal cinders outside the accident site when the heater exploded, causing the wall of the Yongda Bank across the street to collapse. Pan was crushed to death by the wall. Under questioning, Xu Zulin confessed that he was too tired from repairing the water heater the night before and could not get up on time the next morning, so his nephew Zhu Fenglan fired the heater in his place, causing the disaster. He hired Attorney Zhu YaKui to defend him. After Judge Feng verified the confession and arguments were concluded, the verdict was set for the 20th.

### Fire at Shanghai First Stage Hotel, Two People Burned to Death

The Room They Were Staying In Had No Exit; Husband and Wife Perish Tragically

On the morning of the 12th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out at the Shanghai First Stage Hotel at No. 568 Henan Road. Fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire. However, the building was destroyed, and two guests staying at the hotel, Jiang Hai榮 (49 years old, from Danyang) and his wife Jiang Liu氏 (41 years old), were trapped in room 36 after escaping from room 74 and burned to death. Firefighters retrieved the bodies and reported it to the General Police Station, who ordered detectives to investigate. It was learned that Jiang Hai榮 was a waiter at the First Spring Pancake Shop downstairs in the hotel. Recently, he had been ill, so he and his wife were staying there. The room they escaped to, room 36, had no exit. The bodies were taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru from the First Special Court arrived at the office to examine the bodies and confirmed that they had both been burned to death before being cremated and claimed by their son, Jiang Shucheng.

### A Sino-Foreign Buddhist Gathering Hosts American Buddhist

The President of the American Dharma Light Society Returns to Shanghai after Pilgrimage to India

On the evening of the 13th (of the month), local Shanghai Buddhists, both Chinese and foreign, hosted a grand banquet at the Kung Teh Lin restaurant in honor of Mr. Antonie, president of the American Dharma Light Society, who had returned to Shanghai after a pilgrimage to Buddhist holy sites in India. The event was quite a success. Details are as follows:

Distinguished Buddhist Figures, Chinese and Foreign, Attend. Attendees included Wang Yiting, Zhu Ziqiao, Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Ding Guicen, Zhao Yunshao, Hu Houfu, Shi Yangsong, Chang Xing, Deng Xia, Hui Kai, etc. Foreign guests included Mr. and Mrs. Krensingh (USA), Mr. Eichwald (Germany), Mrs. Rebitder (Russia), Mr. Joseph (India), Mr. Crumb (Ceylon), and over thirty others. The banquet began promptly at six o'clock, with Wang Yiting presiding. Qu Wenliu delivered the welcome speech, followed by a speech from Antonie (speech recorded separately). Hu Houfu translated the speeches throughout the evening. The banquet concluded at a little past nine o'clock, with the guests and hosts parting in high spirits.

Qu Wenliu Delivers the Welcome Speech. Mr. Qu delivered the opening address, stating, "Today, fellow Buddhists from China and abroad gather here to host this welcome banquet for Mr. Antonie. Besides our Chinese Buddhist colleagues and members of the Dharma Light Society, we are also joined by individuals from England, Germany, the United States, and Russia. This is a truly rare and momentous occasion, and one that is highly worthy of commemoration. On behalf of the Dharma Light Society and all my colleagues, I extend a heartfelt welcome to Mr. Antonie. Mr. Antonie is the president of the Dharma Light Society and has extensively studied Mahayana Buddhism. His dedication to embarking on this pilgrimage to the sacred sites of India is highly admirable. Furthermore, recognizing that while India is the birthplace of Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism is currently declining there, he has made a grand vow to promote Mahayana Buddhism from our country to India, so that the flickering flame of wisdom may once again illuminate the world. This spirit is particularly commendable."

Mr. Antonie Speaks on His Pilgrimage. Mr. Antonie stated, "I am deeply honored to have you all hold this grand welcome banquet for me. I am but a student and cannot speak of propagating the Supreme Vehicle of Buddhism. My trip to India for the past two months was merely a pilgrimage to the holy sites. As everyone knows, Indian history has traditionally lacked a systematic and detailed compilation. What exists today is only what has been passed down by a few monks. The Indian universities are now paying special attention to collecting materials related to this history. This history can be said to be a treasure, and this treasure is currently in your country's Tripitaka. Now that there is a need for it and it is being preserved, cooperation between both sides is necessary. Of course, our treasure came from India, and it took a lot of time and effort. It is our duty to propagate this Dharma treasure, and we should return it to that country. People in India also hope that we will return it. In "Sarnath," a new building was recently built and a completion ceremony was held. Many Chinese Buddhists and Indian Buddhists also joined in. Everyone was enthusiastically connecting with each other. Looking at it this way, the current Buddhists in India, using today and tomorrow as an analogy, today's Buddhists do not yet have the power to develop, but tomorrow's Buddhists will definitely be able to greatly promote and occupy a great advantage. What's more, now Calcutta University, and Indian people, etc., are very eager to cooperate with China to connect with each other and promote Mahayana Buddhism from "Sarnath" to "Bodh Gaya". This is where Shakyamuni attained enlightenment. The temples here are solemn and magnificent, but unfortunately, they are not presided over by Buddhists, but have fallen into the hands of outsiders. Many people go there to worship, especially Tibetans and Burmese. From "Bodh Gaya" to "Patna" is only seventy-five miles away from "Orissa". In these two places, there is a very large museum, displaying many ancient Buddhist artifacts. It seems that the ancient art of India and the art of the Central Plains are very similar. The exquisite sculptures are almost indistinguishable as Chinese or Indian, unlike Tibet, Siam, etc., which can be distinguished. I originally wanted to go from "Patna" to "Nalanda" to "Vulture Peak", but because of the cold weather and time constraints, I did not succeed, so I returned to "Sarnath" from "Patna". There is a large Bodhi Society in the "Deer Park," which is organized by the Sri Lankans. The results are very good and the construction is very complete. The books are all made by Japanese masters. There are various ancient Buddhas sculpted on the buildings. Every architectural plan contains historical significance. The old site of the Deer Park from 1,250 years ago is still preserved today. Near the Ganges River, there is a very magnificent staircase, and scholars carry water up and down. I saw the tea fields of ancient times also have stairs. According to what I heard, it is very lucky to die and be cremated there. From "Sarnath" to "Mumbai," the train traveled only fifteen miles an hour. I brought my own luggage here and the weather was very cold. "Mumbai" is a very progressive city with a large university and is the center of Buddhism. There is a large temple with a large lecture hall and a large hospital. These are all under the management of the Bodhi Society, and many English publications are issued. There are also publications in Indian script. Also, a very interesting "Key Points of the Wonderful Dharma" is issued. This time, I brought back thirty sections to distribute to my colleagues. Later, I took a boat to "Ceylon" because my old friend Master Ranada was there. I had appointments every day and was so busy that I didn't even have time to rest and eat. This kind of overly attentive reception made me feel uneasy as a guest. Master Ranada took me to "Anuradhapura," the ancient city of Ceylon, to worship. This is where King Ashoka promoted Buddhism. King Ashoka sent his son, named "Mahinda," to "Lanka" (the ancient name of Ceylon). Finally, he sent his daughter to bring the Bodhi tree to meet the prince. This Bodhi tree was planted there. This Bodhi tree is the oldest in the world. This time I was very lucky. I should thank the blessing of my Buddha. I brought back three small buds to offer to Master Taixu and Master Yuanying (one has already been offered to Mr. Ho Tung in Hong Kong). There are many ancient relics there, and they are all very magnificent, covering an area of about several miles. There is also a round stupa, inside which are enshrined two ancient Buddhas from before Shakyamuni and the relics of the World Honored One. There is also a "Prince's Mountain" there, on which there is a very tall building, estimated to be over 300 feet, but only 40 feet can be climbed. The remaining one hundred feet can no longer be climbed. The carvings and paintings there are also very unique, comparable to the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, China. After visiting Ceylon, I returned to Shanghai. What I have said today is just a brief overview. I hope everyone will forgive me."

### Three Robbers Captured

Detectives Discover Three Robbers Planning a Robbery, Secretly Arrest Them. One Robber Shot and Injured. All Awaiting Further Investigation and Interrogation

Chief Inspector Wang Chenying and Zhu Shouling of the Detective Department of the General Police Station learned that several notorious robbers were planning to rob the property of a resident on 4th Pinlang Road, Gordon Road, at approximately 7:00 AM tomorrow, and that they would be carrying weapons such as Mauser pistols. Therefore, they, along with Western Detective Platel, Chinese Detective Wang Jinsheng, Qian Xianting, and others, went to the location at approximately 5:00 AM this morning to wait. At 8:15 AM, they saw three men from Tongzhou, Pan Fuchang, Qu Chongen, and Wang Ali. After Wang separated from them by about ten yards, the detectives stepped forward and apprehended Pan and Qu. A fake Mauser pistol was found on Qu's person. When they were about to arrest Wang, Wang immediately fled. Western Detective Platel immediately pursued him. When they reached Seymour Road, Wang suddenly reached into his pocket, appearing as if he was going to draw a gun to resist. Platel then preemptively fired two shots at Wang, hitting Wang's right thigh, causing him to fall to the ground before he was apprehended. Upon searching him, no weapon was found. They were all taken to the police station, and the suspect Wang was sent to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Dong Yiting of the First Special District Court was presented with the case by Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, who stated the situation and claimed that the defendants had committed many crimes within the concession and that an investigation was necessary, so he requested permission to detain them for investigation. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the documents and granted permission for detention for one week for further interrogation.

### Shanghai Health Bureau Rectifies the Appearance of Western Shanghai

Sending Out a Large Number of Personnel to Bury Coffins Along the Road

The Shanghai Health Bureau, considering the sight of exposed coffins and bone boxes on the open spaces of West Shanghai, along Zhongshan Road, Longhua Road, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and even along the main roads of bustling towns, where coffins were placed at will, resulting in corpses and bones littering the ground, foul odors spreading everywhere, obstructing the view, and hindering sanitation, finally dispatched personnel to bury all the exposed coffins and bone boxes along the way, regardless of whether they were claimed or unclaimed, on the spot. The work was very busy. Zhongshan Road and other places have already been cleared, and they are now rushing to bury the coffins along both sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the new Longhua area. Floating coffins in the villages have also been notified to bury themselves within two days, or they will be buried for them to improve the appearance of the city.

### Doctor of Engineering Huang Wanli to Return to China

Arriving in Shanghai on the 20th

Huang Wanli, a native of Chuansha, Jiangsu, graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of Tangshan Jiaotong University in June of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932]. He invented three theories related to structural engineering, which were published by the school in a special edition. In January of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], he passed the Jiangsu Provincial Government-funded study abroad examination and went to the United States, entering Cornell University to major in hydraulic engineering and minor in meteorology. In January of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], he received a Master of Civil Engineering degree and then entered the University of Iowa, still studying hydraulics. In September, he entered the University of Illinois, still studying hydraulics. In the same year, he invented the "Instantaneous Flow Chart Theory." His doctoral dissertation has now been completed and has been deemed satisfactory by various professors. On March 6th, he boarded the Empress of Russia of the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company, leaving Seattle and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th. It is reported that Mr. Huang obtained a doctorate in engineering from this university, making him the first Chinese person to do so. (In the 70-year history of the University of Illinois, only six people have obtained a doctorate in civil engineering, and no Chinese person has ever obtained it.) His dissertation contains three new theories and twelve new methods, making a great contribution to the field of hydraulic engineering. The time spent on this research was one and a half years, a total of 2,100 hours. Mr. Huang's research success is attributed to his extensive practical experience in China, such as his internships on the Ping-Sui Railway, Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, Jiangshanjiang Bridge, and Nanjing Municipal Engineering Bureau, as well as his exposure to hydraulic engineering projects in the eastern United States after arriving in the United States, his work as an engineer at the U.S. Dam Construction Office, and his internship at the U.S. Mississippi River Diversion Office, observing flood control and waterway engineering. His special skills include the estimation of hydrological observation quantities. His expertise includes: ㊀ flood control methods and engineering facilities; ㊁ design and construction of concrete dams and earth dams; ㊂ concrete manufacturing methods, selection and supervision of special cements, quarrying, crushing stone into sand, and mixing methods. His general skills include: ㊀ design and construction of general civil engineering; ㊁ hydroelectric power plant design; ㊂ irrigation engineering.

### The Xu Family Sues Over Inheritance, Bringing a Wooden Crate of Genealogy Books to Court

Was Xu Yibao Adopted by Xu Jingui as His Heir? The Five Branches of the Same Clan Have Conflicting Interests and Are in Dispute

The Xu Shengji Printing House was founded by Xu Jingui, a native of Ningbo. His printing factory is located on Tangshan Road, and he has a distribution office on Fuzhou Road. The Xu family is a large clan in Ningbo, so his employees are all his brothers, nephews, and sons. The current manager, Xu Yibao, is his nephew. Jingui passed away some years ago, leaving behind tens of thousands of dollars in assets. Initially, his wife, Madam Wang, managed the assets. After Madam Wang died last year, Yibao declared that he had been adopted by Jingui as his heir during his lifetime and should inherit all of the assets. However, some of Jingui's close relatives, consisting of five branches, claimed that Yibao's inheritance was illegal and that Yibao had privately altered the family genealogy, disrupting the lineage. They convened a clan meeting at the ancestral hall in Ningbo, but were unable to reach a peaceful resolution. Therefore, Xu Jingqing, Xu Jingjin, Xu Yiliang, Xu Weiliang, Xu Youliang, and other five representatives of the third and fifth branches appointed a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Xu Yibao in the First Special District Local Court, seeking to declare the inheritance invalid. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gui Yu opened the court to hear the case. Only Jingjin of the five plaintiffs was absent. The other four, along with Xu Yibao, personally appeared in court. In addition, over thirty or forty family members in Shanghai, both young and old, male and female, attended the hearing. The clan leader, Mr. Xu, being over eighty years old and unable to walk easily, specially sent a representative, Xu Hongnian, bringing a wooden crate of Xu family genealogy books to the court for verification. At this point, the seventh court was almost entirely filled with Xu family members, a truly homogenous case. The plaintiff, Xu Jingqing, was older and hard of hearing. Yiliang and Weiliang were both poor speakers. Therefore, they appointed Youliang to cross-examine the defendant, Xu Yibao. After Judge Gui asked about the names, ages, and seniority of both parties, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs began to state the purpose of the lawsuit, saying that the ancestors of the plaintiffs were divided into six branches, and the deceased Xu Jingui belonged to the fourth branch. Jingui only had daughters. After his death, the assets, estimated at three to four hundred thousand dollars, were managed by his wife, Madam Wang. Last year, Madam Wang passed away, and the defendant, Xu Yibao, declared that he had inherited Jingui as his heir and should inherit all of the assets. Yibao was originally a partner in Xu Shengji and has since become the manager. The plaintiffs had never heard of Yibao's inheritance, so they returned to their hometown to check the genealogy and found a record stating that Yibao had inherited Jingui, but this genealogy was printed by Xu Shengji, so this record must have been privately added by the defendant. Otherwise, why would the other genealogy books be silent on this matter? Furthermore, the Xu clan leader also believes that it would be illegal for Yibao to inherit. Therefore, they request that the inheritance be declared invalid. As for the amount of the estate, it is currently not limited to three to four hundred thousand dollars, but has increased to seven to eight hundred thousand dollars. The lawyer representing Xu Yibao then replied that Jingui had adopted Yibao as his heir during his lifetime, which was decided when Yibao was ten years old. The genealogy was revised in the ninth year of the Republic [i.e., 1920], and this matter had long been recognized by the entire clan. Moreover, Jingui left a will upon his death, so how can it be overturned now? Although the plaintiffs are now claiming that Jingui's estate should be jointly owned, the plaintiffs are nominally acting on behalf of several branches, but in reality, it is only the claim of one branch, the fifth branch. The eldest and second branches are not listed on the lawsuit. Xu Jingjin of the fifth branch has sent a letter to the defendant stating that he does not want to be involved. Now he is not even present. Xu Yiliang of the first branch is a descendant of the second branch, and his adoption as a branch member is even more of a scheme to seek support and should be investigated for its motives. It should be known that the revision of the genealogy was public, so how can it now be denied? He added that Yibao had been living with Jingui for a long time and could be considered an heir, while Xu Weiliang had also served at Shengji for a long time. Wouldn't he also have a share in the inheritance? The court then questioned Weiliang, who testified that he had previously worked as a printer at Shengji and had resigned six years ago. The official then said to him, "If you had stayed there a few more years, you might be the defendant today!" The audience laughed. The official considered that the case was complex and that the plaintiffs were not all present, so he announced a recess and would hear the case again on the morning of the 16th of this month.

### Schoolboy Xiao Yinsheng Released after Being Kidnapped

After Inquiring About Xiao Sheng's Family, the Kidnappers Realized It Was a Mistake. The Gang's Target Was a Student Named Wang

At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning, at a certain elementary school located at 439 Aierjin Road, North Henan Road, just as students of all grades were arriving at school one after another, Xiao Yinsheng, a thirteen-year-old student from Chaozhou in the fourth grade of the school, also arrived at school at approximately 8:10 AM. Unexpectedly, just as he was approaching the corner of Aierjin Road and North Henan Road, four thugs suddenly appeared. One thug held a gun, and three thugs held towels and other items, which they used to cover Xiao's mouth and eyes, pushing him into a car that was parked by the roadside and speeding away to the south. At the time, the school and the nearby shops were unaware of what had happened. Even Xiao's family did not know that he had encountered an accident. By noon, Xiao's family had not seen him return home for lunch. Although they had some suspicions, they still thought that he might be at a classmate's house and did not investigate further. It was not until around 6:00 PM that he was still missing that they began to panic and rushed to the school to inquire. They were told that the student had not come to school. Just as they were anxiously wondering what to do, they suddenly saw Xiao Yinsheng sitting in a rickshaw, calling out to Hong'an Lane on North Henan Road. His family saw him and were overjoyed. They rushed forward and asked what had happened. They learned that he had been kidnapped, but he could not remember where he had been taken because he was unfamiliar with the roads. After the thugs asked his name and learned that it was not Wang, they realized that they had kidnapped the wrong person. They blindfolded him again and sent him to Beidang Road in the French Concession, where they removed the cloth and fled. Xiao, seeing that he had escaped from the tiger's mouth, hurriedly urged the rickshaw driver to take him home. Xiao's family, after learning the details, immediately went to the police station to report the incident. The police station dispatched detectives to investigate and pursue the criminals. As for Xiao's family background, it is reported that they are not wealthy. His father has passed away, and his grandfather, named Bingguang, has been a doctor living at 167 Hong'an Lane for many years. Based on the words of the thugs who questioned Xiao, it is clear that their target was to kidnap someone named Wang.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Junshan

2. The Truth of Modern Politics - Distinguishing Between the Form and Substance of Modern Politics.

Here, we will discuss it from two aspects:

1.  Political Form;

2.  Political Substance.

The form of politics is the appearance of politics, while the substance of politics is the content of politics. What is the form of modern politics? On the surface, everyone knows it is monarchy and democracy. However, so-called monarchy and democracy are merely forms, or rather, superficial appearances. If we look at today's countries, they are either constitutional monarchies or democratic republics, but this monarchy and democracy have little to do with politics; therefore, it is merely an outer form and is not essential.

Next, we will talk about the substance of politics. What is the substance of politics in general? It is the rule of law and party rule. Any monarchical or democratic country cannot escape these two aspects in its political substance. Because law is the basis of politics, and the party is the driving force of politics. The substance of politics is nothing more than the belief and action of politics; law is the belief of politics, and the party is the action of politics. These two things are fully expressed in any country today. Therefore, although today's countries have distinctions in their outer form, such as monarchy and democracy, they are actually just the rule of law and party rule. This explains why the democratic trend once soared, but the nominal position of the monarch can still be maintained to this day. Similarly, it explains why so-called democratic politics is merely a facade today—this can be understood by comparing the political form and political substance of various countries. Therefore, strictly speaking: today there is only the politics of the rule of law and the politics of party rule, and there is no truly monarchical politics or democratic politics. (To be continued)

### Yarn and Cotton

Existing Yarn Market Returns After Speculative Yarn Price Rise

The yarn market is generally sluggish and stable, mainly because spot yarn transactions are relatively smooth. Sichuan buyers are particularly active, boosting market sentiment somewhat. In addition, U.S. cotton No. 3 yarn has risen again, pushing up the local market. However, most short sellers, considering the significant increase in domestic yarn spindles and the inevitable increase in production volume, and also the claim that there are stockpiles of spot yarn in various inland areas, believe that the supply and demand in the future can be balanced. There are still many who sell when prices rise. The market has been hovering for days, showing little strength. Shanghai's yarn inventory at the end of February has increased by more than 23,000 bales compared to October.

Both Bulls and Bears are Increasing Bets

Speculative Yarn Market Opens with Different Prices for Each Month. Unexpectedly, when the second session opened, rumors spread in the market that a certain bull was preparing to take delivery, and Sichuan buyers transacted 1,600 bales of spot yarn. No. 3 yarn rose again by 2.78 to 3 yuan. Consequently, short sellers covered their positions, and buying interest was strong, causing the prices of each month to trend upward. However, both major bulls and bears increased their bets. By the close, near-term prices were still high, while long-term prices fell. The results of speculative yarn trading showed that prices for each month increased by 0.57 to 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. When the afternoon session opened, this month's price dropped again because the yarn sales report showed that a portion of the transactions were made by Japanese firms, and yarn inventory also increased, calming market sentiment. There were no significant changes in the second and third sessions. However, the closing price of No. 3 yarn still rose. The results of speculative yarn trading showed that this month's price fell by 0.6 yuan compared to the morning closing price, while other months rose or fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Sales volume: Hengyi 3,050 bales, Jinchang 3,600 bales, Gengfeng 2,050 bales, Renfeng 1,000 bales, Yida 1,000 bales, Dayong 2,100 bales, Xincheng 1,000 bales. Purchase volume: Runkang 1,000 bales, Taixing 1,350 bales, Mingde 1,250 bales, Zhenda 1,050 bales, Shenji 2,200 bales, Dachangcheng 1,350 bales, Yichang 1,350 bales, Shengyuan 1,000 bales, Yongda 1,000 bales, Fukang 1,350 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Sales are Active

It is found that the total amount of yarn purchased by various groups throughout the day is 3,798 bales. The market generally says that the Sichuan group has 1,500 bales, which were purchased before, shipped yesterday, and reported repeatedly. After a thorough investigation, it was found that 1,100 bales were transacted on the previous day (Sunday). The amount of purchases by various groups is listed below.

Large Warehouse Stocks Make it Difficult for Cotton Prices to Rise Strongly

Prices for Each Month Rebound by 0.2 to 0.4 Yuan

The cotton market has turned upward due to rising prices in the British and Indian cotton markets, which has boosted market sentiment. Some have a strong desire to go long. However, the local cotton inventory is sufficient, and the factories have abundant reserves, enough to meet the needs for three to four months. In addition, a significant portion of the inland stock has not yet been shipped. Therefore, the upward momentum of cotton prices is not strong.

Speculative Cotton Bulls Increase Bets

When the speculative cotton market opened in the morning, the market was not strong. After the second session, the cotton market picked up because the U.S. and Indian cotton markets were still good and the yarn market rebounded. The results of speculative cotton trading showed that prices for each month increased by 0.05 to 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation was normal when the afternoon session opened, and the trading floor was calm. Gengfeng sold in large quantities, and the bulls also purchased and increased their bets. The results of speculative cotton trading showed that prices for each month increased again by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales volume: Jinchang 9,300 dan, Yuda 4,900 dan, Jifeng 1,900 dan, Changfeng 9,800 dan, Gengfeng 7,600 dan, Hexing 1,300 dan, Changji 2,000 dan, Dachangcheng 1,800 dan, Xincheng 2,200 dan, Yikang 1,700 dan, Changhe 2,000 dan, Dachang 1,500 dan. Purchase volume: Taichang 8,400 dan, Tongji 1,800 dan, Kuoda 4,900 dan, Changyu 1,500 dan, Shenji 1,700 dan, Yichang 10,800 dan, Shengyuan 1,900 dan, Yuanyi 1,700 dan, Fukang 2,200 dan, Yongda 2,900 dan, Runkang 1,900 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Cotton Mills' Demand is Not Strong

Spot cotton consumption is mediocre, and factory demand has not seen a large increase. There is no information on sources.

Yarn Stockpiles at Chinese and Foreign Factories Increase Sharply

Total Amount is 51,568 Bales

An Increase of 23,369 Bales Compared to Last Month

As of the end of February, the cotton yarn inventory of Chinese, British, and Japanese factories in this port was 4,267 bales for Japanese factories and 47,301 bales for Chinese factories, totaling 51,568 bales.

Japan-India Trade Agreement Resolved Satisfactorily

Indian Cotton Exports to Japan are Expected to Improve

Last week's market situation was volatile due to the upward trend of U.S. cotton and the lack of substantial exports of spot cotton. The price drop was due to short sellers dumping their positions. Japanese merchants and brokers purchased heavily during the price drop. With the satisfactory resolution of the Japan-India trade agreement, or an improvement, Lancashire and Mainland groups were quite active. Japanese exporters also transacted. Local yarn mills' demand was weak. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales).

### Piece Goods

Heavyweight Coarse Cloth is the Most Firmly Priced

Seasonal Piece Goods Sales are Also Active

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was stable, and sales prices were generally as before. Seasonal light-colored standard cloth, poplin, striped cloth, printed cloth, satin, and Klow silk cloth are experiencing increased sales in various retail outlets due to the warm weather. Inland groups from this street and northern routes, including Yantai, Tianjin, the Yangtze River basin, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other regions, are adding to their purchases, and daily shipments are very crowded. Sales of unbleached cotton cloth, muslin, and twill are lower than light-colored fabrics. Heavyweight coarse cloth remains in high demand due to strong military orders, and goods are extremely scarce. Shenxin and other factories continue to release over a thousand pieces, but spot goods are insufficient to meet demand. Shipments for March are required. Sichuan and Yunnan groups, which have been inactive for years, have been inquiring about prices and negotiating prices in recent days. According to various agents stationed in Shanghai, there is hope for activity soon.

### Grains

Bulls and Bears Settle Positions

Speculative Flour Market Turns Stable

After the flour market opened yesterday morning, prices for each month showed a pattern of initially softening and then stabilizing. Foreign wheat was reported to have fallen, with Chicago down 0.42 yuan and Canada down 0.23 yuan. Liverpool was down a little more than one penny. When prices opened, foreign wheat was still slightly lower, and market sentiment remained weak. This month's opening price was only 3.9 yuan, and the prices for other months were also slightly lower by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. However, after the second session, the bulls continued to sell actively, and the short sellers of the factories also took the opportunity to cover their positions. As the bulls and bears settled their positions, the market stabilized, and near-term prices rebounded by 0.01 yuan from the initial opening. As the speculative market fluctuated, the market opened in the afternoon. This month's price initially reached the 0.9 yuan mark due to the bulls selling, but then the factories covered their positions again, and prices rebounded. The bulls held on to the April price, and the situation was very stable. Observing the next step, if price easing can stimulate actual sales, this month's price may be temporarily stable.

Near-Term Old Wheat Market is Weak

After the speculative wheat market opened yesterday morning, prices for each month showed a pattern of near-term weakness and long-term stability. Foreign wheat prices were reported to have continued to decline by 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 yuan, and a little more than one penny. When prices opened, sales of this month's 4-flour were sluggish, and market sentiment was very weak. Therefore, the opening price was as low as 6.4 yuan. Prices below April were also slightly lower by 0.02, 0.03, or 0.04 yuan. Later, as the flour market rebounded, prices also rebounded slightly. When the afternoon market opened, the market for each month generally fluctuated. Because the flour market was still flat, it was difficult to boost confidence. There was little competition for new wheat below June, as there was no certainty about the wheat seedlings at present, so there was little fluctuation. In the spot wheat market, factories were not greedy, and the asking price was also slightly lower by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. Kai'an wheat was 6.37 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat was 6.32 yuan, with only over a thousand bags being traded.

Thin Indica Rice Market Tightens Slightly

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only about 3,100 shi of goods from various sources arrived, around the tenth of the month. Although the supply was scarce, sales were also sluggish, leading to a situation of stability with slight softness in the thick japonica market. However, the thin indica market saw the Henan group purchasing over 1,000 bags, tightening the market by a few points. Du Jian high-priced was stable while lower qualities were weak. Yin Yuan saw no ups or downs.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 18 or 19 ships arrived from various places downstream. The early market for white japonica, where the sales were slightly active, and the market for higher-quality goods was firm. Medium and lower qualities were priced 0.03 to 0.05 yuan lower. At the close, the market became sluggish and the situation was normal. The thin indica market saw normal sales, and prices showed a softening trend. All indica varieties were peaceful, with higher-quality white yuan standing firm and medium and lower qualities being weak. There were no gains or losses in the prices of other goods.

Passenger Indica Rice Sees Continued Purchases by Guangdong Groups

—Prices Rebound by 0.05 to 0.1 Yuan—

Yesterday, both passenger indica rice arrivals and sales were strong, and the market was quite lively. Yesterday, due to continued purchases by Guangdong groups, transactions increased sharply. More than 30,000 bags were sold throughout the day, with Guangdong groups accounting for 70%. Guangdong groups were eager to purchase late-maturing rice and brown rice, so the price of late-maturing rice rose sharply by 0.1 yuan, while the price of brown rice rose by 0.05 yuan. Early-maturing rice remained flat, and other rice varieties rose by varying amounts, from 0.02 or 0.03 to 0.05 or 0.06 yuan. The Xi'an group also traded nearly 1,000 bags of Ji Jing rice. Shantou only purchased a small amount of early-maturing rice. The market for machine-milled rice on this street is still strong, but the current arrivals and inventories in the market are both high, and most cargo owners are eager to sell, so the market will be difficult to rise excessively in the future. Throughout the day, 17,668 bags of Jiangxi rice, 10,100 bags of Hunan rice, 2,500 bags of Hankou brown rice, and 80 bags of Shaoxing machine-milled yuan were sold.

Soybean Prices Slightly Decline

Yesterday's soybean market, due to hesitant sentiment on both the buying and selling sides, was mediocre and lackluster. Prices were mostly stable, due to the limited arrivals and inventory. Moreover, soybean cake sales in Shantou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and other places continued, so although Dalian was soft, it was difficult for local sentiment to decline. Yesterday, it was estimated that oil mills purchased four or five carloads of Siping Street soybeans, two carloads of Yingzhou soybeans, and two carloads of Tongliao soybeans. The market on this street transacted over 1,500 bags of Hankou Zha beans, 415 bags of Jiujiang winter beans, and 600 bags of Du soybean sand yellow.

### Finance

Benchmark Gold Once Soars

Swap Premiums Increase Step by Step

Spot Dealers Take the Opportunity to Sell

The gold market initially tightened because the overseas silver market contracted slightly and exchange rates rose slightly. London spot gold fell by one penny. The central bank's official exchange rate announcement showed that the rates for both the UK and the US were flat. The customs gold unit fell by 0.02 yuan. The benchmark price for benchmark gold was reduced to 1157.8 yuan. The morning opening was slightly higher. The exchange market hardened and fell once after opening. However, many parties added positions after the low, and it was easy to pull it up. The swap premium was initially offered by the short side by 0.2-0.3 yuan in the afternoon session. but there were a lot of premiums and the premium rose step by step.

### Securities

The Bond Market Does Not Deviate from the Overall Correction

—Long-Short Have Slightly Changed Their Positions—

The market situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange yesterday was stable, and there was still no improvement in transactions. Both the long and short parties have slightly changed their positions, and the buying and selling prices insist on each other, and the overall situation is still fluctuating. However, the trend has become weak in the afternoon, and the market price prospect will be low before the high and then a return. After a period of increase of the price of the 96 public debt, it has already turned around. It was a flash in the pan and disappeared in an instant, which shows that there are fewer blind followers than before, but there are still some people with nervous conditions who are still holding on, and their goal is to think that Kodama's visit to China may be related to 96. In fact, Japan's attitude towards China is still based on the three principles, and the so-called economic cooperation is just a smokescreen. The market price was slightly increased by 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 yuan. Most of the number 11 was slightly purchased. The market price became slightly weaker again in the second disc because the number 32 was slightly sold.

### Silk and Tea

Japanese Silk Still Rises and User Silk Prices Also Rise

Black Iron Sheets Think of Change After being Calm

The black iron sheet market has been depressed for a long time and our counterparts and customers have not paid attention to the goods for a long time.

### Striving for Afforestation

— Lü Bing

In the warm spring light, afforestation movements are being carried out everywhere, advocating tree planting. The benefits of tree planting, such as regulating temperature, preventing floods and droughts, increasing production, and developing land resources, have been promoted for many years and are all-encompassing. When we carefully consider its meaning, we should deeply understand that the afforestation movement is extremely important and significant for the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Our country has a vast territory, but resources are not fully utilized. The reason for this is that the land has not been fully developed. Looking at various provinces, there are many places where barren land has not been planted. Moreover, the areas once known for producing forests, such as Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, are being felled daily, and only a decrease in production is seen. With the scarcity of forests, the country frequently experiences floods and droughts, and with the shortage of timber, timber prices also rise. Think back a decade or so ago, an eight-and-a-half-meter telegraph pole with a top diameter of fourteen centimeters cost less than five yuan per pole. In recent years, the price has increased severalfold. Although this is related to taxes and transportation costs, the increase in the price of timber itself due to the lack of supply is an undeniable fact.

Wooden poles are a major item in telecommunications materials. In terms of the purchases made by the Ministry of Communications in recent years, there were a total of 132,924 poles in 1934 and 120,108 poles in 1935. Although there are no statistics for 1936 yet, it is likely to be not much different. As for other items requiring timber, they are not included in these figures. It is estimated that the Ministry of Communications spends at least 18% of its total material costs on timber for annual maintenance and expansion, amounting to about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. If domestic afforestation does not develop and the existing production decreases daily, timber prices will inevitably rise, and the burden will increase. This will create great difficulties for the maintenance and expansion of the telecommunications industry.

The above only refers to the telecommunications sector. In fact, transportation, such as railways and ships, requires a huge amount of timber. In addition, other industries have even more uses, which are too numerous to mention. Currently, most of the timber for various constructions is sourced from overseas. If the forestry industry continues to lag behind, items such as telegraph poles will also have to rely on imports, and the loss of resources will further increase the leakage of wealth. Therefore, whether it is for regulating temperature and preventing floods and droughts, or for increasing timber production and self-sufficiency, the afforestation movement is undoubtedly an urgent task for our country. On the occasion of Arbor Day, we dare to use this publication to urge our compatriots to pay attention and strive for afforestation!

### Opening of Wireless Circuit between Shanghai and Osaka

— Zhen

According to local newspaper reports, since the opening of the direct wireless telegraph circuit between Shanghai and Tokyo in June 1934, Sino-Japanese wireless telegraphs have been known for their rapid and accurate communication, which has been well-received by Chinese and foreign individuals. The telegraph service has developed greatly. However, since the commercial center of Japan is located in Osaka and other places, there is an urgent need for direct communication between Shanghai and Osaka. After discussions between the Ministry of Communications and the Japanese telecommunications authorities, a direct wireless circuit between Shanghai and Osaka has been established. The Shanghai International Radio Station and the Osaka Radio Station have been conducting communication tests, with excellent results. The circuit was officially opened on March 8. Subsequently, Sino-Japanese telegrams will be relayed by the Osaka Radio Station, making communication even faster. It can be predicted that the Sino-Japanese wireless telegraph business will continue to develop.

We cannot help but be delighted when reading the above news! On the one hand, we deeply admire the Sino-Japanese telecommunications authorities for re-establishing a direct Sino-Japanese wireless circuit from an economic standpoint. On the other hand, we wish that the people of China and Japan can use the benefits of communication to promote economic cooperation. China and Japan are as close as lips and teeth, and should cooperate closely to consolidate peace in East Asia, without a doubt. Since the Eastern Provinces Incident, due to political relations, the relations between the two countries have been on the verge of danger many times! Now, the Hayashi cabinet, with Sato as Foreign Minister, has changed its policy towards China, stating that it will promote political coordination through economic cooperation. In addition to expressing our full support, we hope that the sincerity of this policy will be put into practice. Now, the Japanese side has changed the location of its communication agencies with China from Tokyo, the political center, to Osaka, the economic center. From this, can we infer that the Japanese diplomacy towards China has abandoned political negotiations and switched to economic consultations?

Nowadays, those who discuss diplomacy pay more attention to people-to-people diplomacy, and the promotion of people-to-people diplomacy depends on the convenience of communication. Since the opening of the direct wireless telegraph between Shanghai and Tokyo in June 1934, the opening of direct wireless telephone in February 1936, and the opening of the direct wireless telegraph between Tianjin and Tokyo in June 1936, the feelings between the people of the two countries have begun to become more harmonious, and their opinions can be exchanged. The principle of coexistence and co-prosperity can only be achieved through mutual understanding and mutual recognition. In other words, the opening of Sino-Japanese wireless telegraphs and telephones is conducive to the improvement of the relations between China and Japan. Who can say it is not appropriate?

In order to facilitate the sending of Osaka wireless telegrams, the Ministry of Communications, in addition to receiving telegrams at the General Receiving and Sending Office of the International Radio Station in Sassoon House on Renji Road, the branch receiving and sending office at 15 Edward Road, and various postal and telegraph offices in Shanghai, can also receive them.

### National Phonetic Alphabet Telegrams to be Launched Soon

— Zhongxian

...Implemented from April 1st...

In January of this year, the telegraph bureaus in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Beiping, Tianjin, Zhenjiang, Qingdao, Jinan, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other twelve places were ordered by the Ministry of Communications to open training classes for National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams. All radio operators, public telegraph operators, transcribers, sealers, delivery personnel, return personnel, and other relevant personnel who handle telegraph services and business matters in each bureau, or those who voluntarily participate in the study of National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams, should be trained in the reading, writing, and standard spelling of the first style of National Phonetic Alphabet (i.e., phonetic symbols) and the second style (i.e., National Romanization Phonetic Spelling Method), as well as the skills of sending and receiving National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams. The training period should be completed in two months. It is reported that the National Phonetic Alphabet telegram training classes established by the bureaus in Shanghai and other places have begun to teach in February and will soon graduate. The Ministry of Communications has specially designated the five telegraph bureaus in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Hankou to pilot National Phonetic Alphabet telegram services starting from April 1, in order to promote the national language and improve the convenience of communication for the public.

National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams use phonetic symbols or Mandarin Romanization to directly transmit and receive. The sending telegraph bureau does not need to translate the outgoing telegram text into code by word, and the receiving telegraph bureau does not need to translate the incoming telegram code into text code by code. Both parties can save a translation procedure, which not only invisibly increases the speed of sending and receiving telegrams, but also allows direct transmission of messages using National Phonetic Alphabet letters, without resorting to four-code telegraphs. Therefore, the pilot of National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams is an important reform in China's telegraph industry. However, the telegraph bureau's trial of National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams is still an innovation. The writing format and word counting and charging methods for this type of telegram must be specified in separate rules. The Ministry of Communications has formulated "Provisional Rules for National Phonetic Alphabet Telegrams" and issued them to the five telegraph bureaus in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Hankou. After receiving them, each telegraph bureau has added these rules to the training items of the National Phonetic Alphabet telegram training class, so that the general trainees can be quite familiar with the writing format and word counting and charging methods stipulated in these rules, so that they can have a basis to follow when they are implemented in the future.

Since the "Provisional Rules for National Phonetic Alphabet Telegrams" promulgated by the Ministry of Communications this time have included the word counting and charging methods, these rules are also of considerable concern to the general public who send and receive National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams. Therefore, the main points of its content are described as follows:

(1) Types and Prices of National Phonetic Alphabet Telegrams National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams are divided into the following two types: (A) Mandarin Chinese telegrams spelled with the first style of National Phonetic Alphabet (i.e., phonetic symbols) (hereinafter referred to as Type A telegrams); (B) Mandarin Chinese telegrams spelled with the second style of National Phonetic Alphabet (i.e., Mandarin Romanization Phonetic Spelling Method) (hereinafter referred to as Type B telegrams). The spelling of the above two types of telegrams should be based on the National Phonetic Alphabet commonly used word list published by the Ministry of Education. Telegrams spelled in local dialects or whose spelling is too different from the standard National Phonetic Alphabet, or which are deemed by the telegraph bureau to contain secret code properties, cannot be listed as National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams. The above two types of National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams are divided into ordinary, urgent, and social categories. Urgent National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams should be marked with 　　 or D fee identification at the beginning of the telegram by the sender, and social National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams should be marked with 　　　 or Sft fee identification at the beginning of the telegram by the sender. Each of the above marks is counted as one word for billing. The annual prices of National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams are as follows: (To be continued)

### New Measures for Reorganizing Long-Distance Telephone Business

— Xuan

(1) Regulations on Long-Distance Telephone Recording and Accounting Methods Since the completion of the Ministry of Communications' long-distance telephone line project in nine provinces, the Ministry of Communications' long-distance business has developed rapidly. In December 1936, the long-distance telephone revenue of Jiangsu, Hebei, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Shandong, and other six provinces totaled more than 164,300 yuan, an increase of more than 64,000 yuan compared to December 1935. The revenue of other provinces has also increased. In view of the increasing long-distance business in various places, the Ministry of Communications believes that each bureau must record the call details on the call record sheet in detail for incoming and outgoing calls. The original practice of checking the number of calls daily and the number of calls for the entire month between bureaus does not contribute much to the actual situation, but increases the workload of operators and occupies lines, which inevitably reduces efficiency. Therefore, separate regulations have been formulated for long-distance telephone recording and accounting methods. All bureaus handling long-distance telephones are divided into trunk line bureaus and non-trunk line bureaus according to their equipment conditions. Those who record the detailed trunk line calls are not recorded in detail by the non-trunk line bureaus to increase the wiring speed. After the calls are checked daily, they are no longer checked by the operators on the long-distance lines on a monthly basis to increase the working hours of the telephone lines.

(2) Regulations on Long-Distance Circuit Numbering Methods In the past, the long-distance telephone coverage was only a few hundred kilometers, but now it has expanded to thousands of kilometers. The number of contact lines in various places has increased, and the complexity of the business is also different. Where should the calls from a certain place to a certain place be transferred? It is not only a technical problem, but also related to the adjustment of the number of calls on each line. For example, calls from place A to place D can be transferred through bureaus B and C, but if bureau B is busier, the calls between A and D should be transferred through bureau C. This point is very important to the long-distance telephone business. Now, the Ministry of Communications has formulated long-distance telephone circuit numbering methods and ordered each telecommunications management bureau to follow them separately, formulate them, and submit them to the ministry for approval in order to determine the transfer route of this call, so as to increase the wiring speed and increase revenue.

Spring and Autumn

### Idle Talk

— (Huang Weiling)

Those who are not married are eager to get married as soon as possible, while those who are married are eager to persuade others to get married later. Therefore, everyone goes through two stages: hoping to get married and regretting getting married.

If men are good friends, the longer they know each other, the better. The friendship between women ends after one of them gets married. Friends, remember, this is a truth.

Two good friends finally separated in tears. Within a month, although people are far apart, letters are still close. After half a year, people are just as far apart, but letters are no longer as close. After a year, people are far away, and letters are also far away.

Men are really unreliable. They go through all kinds of hardships to get married, but soon they feel that their wives are not lovely and are about to be classified as "yellow-faced women." Therefore, someone invented a new term: "early yellow."

### Cultivating Forbearance

— Zhang Huang

Legend has it that there is a large family spanning five generations, with the words "Hall of a Hundred Forbearances" emblazoned in the main house, believing that the ability of each person to endure is the reason why their family can live together.

However, I have the opposite opinion: you are only truly qualified to call yourself the "Master of the Hall of a Hundred Forbearances" when you are married and the head of a small family! No matter how irritable and stubborn your nature may be, you must reform quickly at that time! Let me tell you a fresh idiom: "Fear neither heaven nor earth, only the mistress of a small family acting as a tyrant."

Think about it, it is inevitable that two people who live together daily will occasionally disagree. However, if you refute a sentence, even if you glance cautiously or sniff your nose, as long as your wife is unhappy, it will at least affect her current work. Isn't that your own business? Or if she gets sick from anger, who will pay for the medical expenses? If things get stiff or big, she may take self-defeating measures to control you. All losses of time, money, and energy, as well as unexpected troubles, will ultimately belong to you. Only by considering that harmony in the family leads to prosperity in all things, cherishing wealth and enduring anger, and even fearing your wife, as in the ancient saying "fearing your wife brings wealth," can you find solace. It is cheaper to endure earlier.

Even if you want to discipline your children, scold your servants—beating chickens and scolding dogs is not originally your business—you must sometimes restrain yourself for the sake of not wanting to hurt the innocent. Day after day, experiencing big and small things, how can you not be tempered to have a peaceful state of mind!

Mistresses of small families, Hail to the Bodhisattva of Forbearance!

### Curtains

— Wei Jing

In Shanghai, the more glass windows a house has, the more luxurious it is considered. Therefore, curtains have become one of the most important decorations in general luxurious families in Shanghai. Because all the light in the room during the day comes in through the windows, the relationship between curtains and human vision is closer. Therefore, the position of curtains among decorations is often more important than tablecloths and the like. As a result, women in luxurious families have gradually paid attention to and worried about the design of curtains.

In Europe and the United States, there are home decoration design experts. Although Shanghai has been extremely Westernized in recent years, it seems that this kind of expertise has not yet appeared. Therefore, curtains are still only in general families, under the subjective conditions of the decorator, striving for harmony with the season and surrounding colors. Generally speaking, the thinnest materials and the lightest colors are used when the weather is hottest. As the weather gets colder, the materials gradually thicken and the colors gradually deepen. However, in recent years, most curtain products have been imported, taking their delicate materials and bright and non-fading dyes. However, the financial leak from this alone is probably not small every year.

In fact, the local cloth produced in our country is an excellent raw material for curtains. Because in the four seasons of the year, except for one summer, which requires thin materials, the other three seasons require curtains that are heavy and drooping, and do not flutter in the slightest breeze. This condition is perfect for our country's local cloth. What needs to be improved now is the dyeing process. If the local cloth can be dyed in harmonious colors, then, when hung in glass windows, its rough surface can instead cover up the ugly points of general cotton fabrics, and fully display its rich and noble appearance.

Curved and complex patterns are now a thing of the past. What is popular this year is simple straight-line patterns. It is naturally not convenient to print complex patterns on rough local cloth. However, printing coarse-lined and artistic straight-line patterns on a whole piece of local cloth and hanging them in the glass windows of a three-dimensional house, matching the three-dimensional furniture in the house, the harmonious component is definitely not comparable to imported printed foreign cloth or flannel curtains, which are disharmonious with everything in the East.

It is true that using local cloth curtains in the summer is too thick. However, using high-quality ramie fabric printed with some simple straight-line patterns, is it still not enough to make curtains? I don't know why the large entrepreneurs who advocate domestic products don't pay attention to this?

### Pepper Chicken

— Owner of Guojie Building

Have you ever eaten rice flower birds and thought they were delicious? Here I'll tell you about something even more delicious than rice flower birds – pepper chicken. Every year in April and May, when the weather gradually warms up, the special product of Lvsi Port, pepper chicken, is about to arrive. After a day or two of southeasterly wind, the people who catch pepper chicken are ready to prepare their tools and go to the seaside to catch pepper chicken. Like flying locusts, a large group of small birds fly from the seaside to the small woods near the salt fields, perching very helplessly. It is said that they have flown from the islands and gone through a very long journey. In the vast sea, there is no place to rest, so after landing, they perch on the trees, exhausted. The people who catch pepper chicken, use a bamboo pole, with a long needle tied to the tip of the pole, stoop down, walk quietly under the tree, reach out the pole through the branches and leaves to prick them. They are very agile and skilled, and the pole never misses. In an instant, they are full of baskets and bags. If your surgery is not good and you startle them, they will desperately fly away together in an instant, throw themselves into the sea, and feed the fish. Moreover, once they leave, they will never come again. As for how to eat this kind of pepper chicken, it is also eaten fried crispy in oil, like rice flower birds. It has a special pepper aroma. It is said that it eats pepper as food in the islands. It is very good for side dishes or to drink with. It's a pity that it hasn't been sold to Shanghai yet. I think if it is made into canned food and transported to Shanghai, its sales will definitely take the place of rice flower birds.

### Attire

— Chen Liang

The more advanced material civilization is, the more the body's inherent abilities degenerate. As far as the urban senses can reach, the omnipotent hand has also become a part of beautifying and embellishing for viewing, washed white with fragrant soap, filing nails, painting nails, applying powder and honey, striving for its tender appearance, and this is no longer a distinction between men and women. The ten fingers are tapered and do not work. The degradation of abilities can be seen. As for the legs and feet, they only wear dancing shoes and dance on spring or glass floors. Stepping out of the door, you have to jump into the car. Climbing stairs, women rely on men's support, and men rely on canes for help. As if they cannot bear the labor of a single step. Compared with birds and beasts, their jumping is far inferior to that of apes, their swimming is not as good as aquatic animals, their majesty cannot match that of lions and tigers, and their endurance is not as good as that of camels. The only thing that allows humans to overcome birds and beasts is wisdom and excellent weapons. The only thing that distinguishes humans from birds and beasts is attire?

What this article wants to say is mainly attire. In ancient times, people ate raw meat and drank blood, lived in the wild and nested in trees. Later, they covered their bodies with leaves, and their lives gradually progressed. When they "first created characters, then wore clothes," they completely broke away from the animal-like living state. Since there has been attire, undoubtedly, the human body's resistance to natural climate has been declining day by day. It cannot withstand the scorching sun and the invasion of wind and cold. Therefore, there is gauze in summer and fur in winter. At first, it was to cover shame, then to keep out the cold and heat. Later, it was regarded as a decoration on the body. The rich and the poor are completely revealed in their attire. Watching Peking opera, even children know who the emperor is, who the official is, and who the common people are, because their attire and props have unique and individual class characteristics.

When I was a child, I watched a grass-roots troupe perform a scene called "The Beggar Ascends the Throne" (I don't know what the name of the play is). The character at the beginning wore a shabby patchwork garment, wore a Taoist scarf, and his face was painted black and white. At a glance, he was known as a beggar. Later, he suddenly put on a brocade robe and a pearl-studded flat crown, with a dignified appearance, like a truly valuable emperor.

If "only clothes matter," then don't monkeys in shows also wear clothes and hats? Can we regard them as humans! If the Buddha wants to be gilded, it will appear "powerful." However, once the "gold" is scraped off, revealing the mud body and wooden frame, even the good men and women who worship idols will probably lose their faith. What is attire then!

### Swapped Nest Luan Phoenix

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Eleven (Words of Complaint and Gratitude for Motherly Love, Confession of Remorse, Committing Suicide for Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dims the Greenish-Black, Scenes Evoke Emotions for Writing)

Just then, the maid brought in a small magnetic teapot of dark green color, freshly brewed with fragrant tea, adding a lot of poetic inspiration. So he took out two sheets of Xuan paper poem cards from the drawer and began to write poems.

Better than being separated by tens of thousands of mountains, a lonely trace in the quiet alley west of the city. The sorrow of meeting each other comes with autumn, the painted eyebrows are thin and not strong.

The west wind sweeps the leaves, dimming the White Gate. The small step in green shirt is timid of Mr. Huang. A turn of autumn eyes can break the heart, no rouge seen, only tear stains.

Each meeting is saddened, clusters of yellow flowers adorn the side of the temples. It is a pity that the slender bones are as clear as water, walking alone in the west wind before the setting sun.

When we met, the willows were graceful, and the fallen wutong trees made speech difficult. Meeting in the cold alley for three hundred days, only looking at people with tearful eyes.

West of Shicheng, north of the Qinhuai River, there is a phoenix perched in the winding alley. Still standing for a short while every day in the midst of busyness, secretly looking at the low green hair.

Often seeing a sad face, yet difficult to approach, only using eyebrow language to inquire about the original peace. Returning home, throwing down the book, foolish as a stone, sitting alone, facing a vase of flowers cut cold.

Guoqi wrote these poems in one breath without adding any punctuation. He himself stood up, paced back and forth in the room with his hands behind his back, pondering, trying to find new ideas to make up ten quatrains. Mrs. Zhang shouted twice from the other room, saying she had something to say. Guoqi put down the idea of writing poetry and quickly went to his mother's room. This conversation lasted about ten minutes. When he walked back to the room, someone was standing in front of him, bowing several times and smiling: I'm really sorry? I didn't think you put these untitled poems on the desk, I read them unintentionally. Guoqi saw that it was his good friend Zhu Xiaosong. This friend was only twenty years old and was the son of a noble family. His father was a famous Jiangnan scholar who had trained Xiaosong to be a young scholar since childhood. Writing poetry and prose was exactly what he liked. In the early years of the Republic of China, when society was welcoming sensual and romantic writings, Xiaosong, at a young age, was eloquent and flowery, and was a red star in the magazine world.

### Situqi Appeals to World Health Scientists for Public Discussion

— Huang Jingwan

The extraordinary Mr. Situqi, who claims to eat bacteria, has caused much doubt in various circles regarding his statements. As this concerns human life, despite my repeated requests to him to find a medical institution willing to test his claims, no such institution has been willing to take on this significant responsibility. He has also repeatedly pleaded with me to find a lawyer to draw up a contract outlining the conditions, but no lawyer has readily agreed. Finding himself in this difficult situation, Mr. Situqi has angrily written a lengthy article appealing to health scientists worldwide to conduct a public study and discussion of his claims about eating bacteria in order to reveal the truth of the matter. What follows is the content of this lengthy article written by his own hand.

He (Situqi referring to himself) says that for the health and happiness of his fellow citizens, he is willing to risk his life and body to request to be tested with disease-causing bacteria to prove that the human body's internal digestive and secretory powers have a natural antibacterial ability. If people pay attention to self-cultivation, they can improve their health and reduce the terror of weakness and death. His enthusiasm for academics is clear and he feels no guilt, but he is now being falsely accused of having a mental illness. However, academics cannot be dictated by the orders or arbitrary decisions of one or two people, but require the public judgment of world medical scientists and health scientists. Now, he asks to discuss it from a scientific theoretical standpoint. Science is the study of experimentation. If Director Yang has already experimented with him eating bacteria and proven that he has no ability to resist the bacteria, then it can be said that his experimental study has failed, but it cannot be said that he has a mental illness, because mental illness is one issue and experimental success or failure is another. Even if it is mental illness, then are all inventors in the world who request experimentation mentally ill? Is this not like the ancients who had not discovered the principles of flight saying that people could never fly, or ignorant people who had not circumnavigated the world dismissing Columbus' theory of a round Earth as madness? According to a statement by Yang Yongnian, Director of the Sanitary Experiment Station, reported in the Jing Central Daily News on February 16, "Although smallpox bacteria have been studied by bacteriologists for many years, they have not been successfully cultured. As for eating the other five types of bacteria, it is factually possible without harming safety." Therefore, Director Yang already believes that resisting bacteria is not unscientific. However, according to Mr. Yang's statement reported in the Xinwen Daily on February 27, "Situqi's so-called theory of resisting bacteria has no scientific basis whatsoever." This directly contradicts his statement on the 16th. Is it possible that it is the same person making contradictory statements? Human evolution relies entirely on invention and experimentation. If it is said that all inventors in the world who request experimentation are mentally ill, then the future of human evolution is hopeless, which is unimaginable. If this is not the case, then he hopes that the Ministry of Health will grant him an experiment to distinguish between truth and falsehood and dispel public doubts. Furthermore, this extremely simple reason should be publicly proven: Is it those who advocate that bacteria can be resisted who are mentally ill, or those who advocate that bacteria cannot be resisted who are mentally ill? This is a scientific question that requires the public judgment of world scientists and cannot be announced in a commanding manner, because commands cannot make three plus five equal sixteen, so they are ineffective in science. For the sake of public health and for the sake of human evolutionary experimentation, he cannot be intimidated by power and abandon his conscience regarding right and wrong. Therefore, he appeals to world health scientists and medical scientists for public judgment. Situqi, February 28.

Commentary

### "Brown-Shirted Madman" and "Great Gorilla"

— Ying Chun

I remember not long ago, around the beginning of last year? The "World Knowledge Yearbook" caused a protest from the German Consul in Shanghai because it contained a statement saying that Hitler was the "arsonist of World War II." Although this did not lead to "harming diplomatic relations," everyone was "tacitly aware" that speaking from then on had to be more cautious. In fact, this kind of restriction only exists in semi-colonial China. Other countries are completely different. For example, recently, the Mayor of New York City in the United States, La Guardia, said that Hitler was a "brown-shirted madman." This case also required the German Ambassador to the United States to protest and the US Secretary of State to apologize to settle the matter. However, the United States repeatedly declared that freedom of speech is guaranteed by the US Constitution, so they cannot interfere with the speech of their citizens. This is naturally where the United States differs from China.

However, on the German side, it was certainly not such a simple and easy end. The so-called "return the favor" and "an eye for an eye" methods have also been learned in German newspapers. According to a Reuters report on the 13th: "...After La Guardia referred to the German leader Hitler as a 'brown-shirted madman,' the German 'Attack Newspaper' intensified its counterattacks, and referred to the Jewish women attending La Guardia's speeches as street prostitutes. Another organ of Hitler's Black Guard drew a large gorilla on the cover, perched on a tall building, like the 'King Kong' in a movie, and its face was La Guardia. The filth of the writing is something that American newspapers are unwilling to publish." At the same time, another Reuters report said: "American journalist Mr. Bossomora has now been publicly expelled by the German government. Mr. Bossomora is a correspondent for the Jewish News Agency. This expulsion is the seventeenth expulsion of a foreign journalist by the German National Socialist government." The latter case, although it does not explain the reason to us, it is not without meaning to bring them up together. In other words, from this, one can also see the difference in freedom of speech between Germany and the United States.

The reaction in Germany to a speech by the mayor of an American city is to attack it en masse, or to refer to the audience as "street prostitutes," or to scold the speaker as a "great gorilla," which is increasingly divorced from the facts. This kind of attitude only exists in militaristic countries, and only people like this are willing to do it. Therefore, it is no wonder that a brawl broke out when "Abyssinia" was shown in Shanghai. However, China is ultimately not comparable to other countries. Insulting films, insulting texts, and even "mad words" promoting the annexation of China and documents spying on China, such as the Zhengzhou Secret Service Case, are not only unable to be protested, but also lead to more complications. Recently, there has even been a film titled "New Earth" which is a collaboration between Japan and Germany with the theme of invading "Manchuria." All kinds of phenomena are very distressing to talk about. But we should also "tooth for tooth, eye for eye"! Therefore, I believe that if we could obtain the kind of freedom of speech guaranteed by the US Constitution, it would be good even if we were seen as a "great gorilla."

### A Day of Searching for a Livelihood

— Xu Ji

The sun rises every day, seemingly a merciless mockery to me. Because the days pass by one by one, and people have to follow the orbit prescribed by astronomy, making endless turns and twists. The sun brings every new day—the sun is smiling, but this smile may be a little like a malicious sneer, because I will hear such a voice: "Now, I am here. I give you a new day, from morning to night. See how you deal with it! See you!"

Thus, with the satisfaction of an indifferent bystander, the sun goes on its goose step inch by inch, and the suffering is my turn to bear. I have to laboriously support the life of a day. I inevitably play out endless bitter faces under the sun.

"To live on," so I no longer intend to think about "death." In fact, "death is originally able to say goodbye to tomorrow's sun—the sun that is like a needle, like a sharp knife, mocking those who have lost their livelihood—but I will not resign from it, but still drag on like pigs and dogs, one day after another...

Therefore, when the pitch-black sky outside the window presents a bright white color, I am the one who first loses the most terrible dream—or, sometimes, a dream that is washed by a clear spring of tears and makes people linger—and worries about the sun hidden below the horizon from the long night. The silence all around is terribly eerie, the breathing of women and children rising and falling like waves in a lifeless storm—sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night and hear women sobbing—the previous sun brought us too much hunger and cold and humiliation, so even if it is a little hazy, I immediately remember instinctively: we have not found anything to eat for another day.

——Going to look for a livelihood, going to look for a livelihood!

The streets are filled with daylight, and cars and people flow by indifferently like water; some people are hunchbacked; some are shouting, some are tightly lipped, as if tightly holding a bellyful of unspeakable resentment; and some are showing fierce or cunning smiles, obviously having taken some exploitation, some advantage, on the heads of others...

Thus, leaving behind the sorrowful faces of my family, with the blankness of an insulted and injured person—or even a numb feeling, I drill into the world of people—searching every corner that memory can reach, searching every person I know—the tragedy is that they are also living in the same situation as me, able to feed the suffering soul with a sentence, a bitter smile, but unable to satisfy the hungry body with even a small piece of bread...

Thus, my thoughts also hit a wall, and the hungry children and our own faces are like a fierce hammer, striking down ruthlessly like lightning—I see sparks before my eyes, I see those greedy, shameless, and lewd faces and eyes flashing before me! I see a cruel and merciless shadow flashing before my eyes again: hunger!

Drifting in the crowd, but I am still like walking alone in the ancient wilderness. The sun has climbed up and is shining dazzlingly in the sky! A day! But how will this day pass? Looking for a livelihood! Yes, I am looking for a livelihood. But in fact, I am like a wandering soul seeking dust! Life slips away from me far away! I don't know where it is lost!

Death is creeping into my heart with its huge black shadow! This time, I really can't help but think of him again and again—and seriously think of him—I know—I am very familiar, at the end of the street flows a foul-smelling great river, in whose embrace forever reside the lonely souls who have lost their livelihood in this huge crowd of millions—its flow is filthy.

I thought of the news of a family suicide, I thought that four sallow corpses would float in this turbid stream—the adults' expressions will be calm and satisfied, only the children's faces will still have innocent stubbornness and unwillingness! However, death, after all, is death—thus the moving news will provide the great men of happiness with information to aid digestion, so people quickly abandon it and forget it—like a gentle breeze lightly brushing away a few grains of dust...

Is death just decided like that? I stopped my feet, but I couldn't help but feel a little moist on my face. Life, even if it is a dead end, I can't throw it so lightly into the turbid stream—no, I won't throw it into the turbid stream, but throw it into the raging fire!

Let it be, a day! Standing in front of a small pawnshop, I could no longer resist taking off the only, almost broken long gown on my body, and bought cakes and noodles back with it, accompanied by thousands of good words...

A day! Let it be. But I really don't want to look at those terrible shadows on the street anymore. I would rather look at the night with straight eyes. I don't need the false sun of tomorrow!

### What I Saw in a Women's Literacy Class

— Yuan Keyu

Wei:

Now I am writing to you again in another new situation. The time is a Saturday evening with a bright moon. It is a quiet early spring night, and a natural poetic feeling given by spring nights is flowing outside the window.

The soft singing that was broadcasting just now has diminished, and the bustling, noisy group of women's literacy class has also left. They are gone. Some have gone to cuddle their children to sleep, some are still continuing their status as maids to do night work for their masters, taking care of the chores they did not do during the day, and some? Are young mistresses, they ran out of the weaving and literacy school to enjoy themselves.

They have just left, but what I saw of them remains in my heart. As their teacher just now, I am developing many feelings about them. They, they are precisely the young women's group, the women's group in the inland, in the townships. Of course! In the current time of shouting for national salvation, they should understand the salvation duties they should bear. Most of them already have children, so they should use the wisdom that modern parents should have to teach their children. (Children, how important they are! The future of China is entirely in their little hands!)

Wei, when you read this, you must say, "They don't care about these things!" At the same time, you will be unable to help but feel sorry for them in your heart, just like me.

My inference should not be wrong, if based on my careful observation of them during several times I went to class and left class!

This group of them includes housewives from the lower classes of the city, working women who live under the ruthless exploitation and oppression of domestic and foreign capitalists, and rural women whose minds are filled with backward feudal superstitious consciousness. They are still stained with the "vanity" that we think should not exist the most. Just look at their clothing and dress: most of them are trying their best to heavily makeup their faces, applying thick amounts of powder. And from their interesting conversations after class, they try their best to say some slightly fashionable, crude, and vulgar words. Some always frantically speak out their extravagant hopes of showing off after weaving and literacy, while others are weak-willed, as if weaving and literacy or illiteracy have nothing to do with them. (This is partly because they do not feel the pain of illiteracy, and partly because of their habit of being dependent, so they are still like old-fashioned women who have no will and are deceived by others.)

Moreover, some of them still have a "shame" character. I have called several of them to read or recognize words, but they always refuse to say it frankly. This is a kind of cowardice, expressing: "I am a weak and incompetent woman." This expression of losing confidence in one's own strength will cause great obstacles in the work of national salvation.

Once when I was in class, I took the opportunity to talk about some of the Suicha

## Page 20

the importance and international situation, but before half a class, they seemed to have felt bored. Naturally, this is because they don't like these things. Even if I use all my strength to express it, it is not enough to arouse their interest. Wei, how disappointed I am! I think, if I were talking about a local theft case or a adultery news, maybe they would like to listen.

Naturally, you don't need me to say it, and you must say: "In this way, these sisters who are groaning in pain, who are oppressed by feudal forces, they still don't know that the current survival of the nation has reached the most serious time. They didn't even think of a 'struggle' idea."

Wei, I dare to say a sentence: the women of inland society, they only see individuals, husbands, and children, and do not see the entire nation, the entire country. The rich only see property, enjoyment, and the power of husbands, fathers, and brothers, and do not see themselves in depravity, in danger, in destroying themselves! The poor only see the tightness of money, the fat ears and big faces of the masters, and do not see themselves being exploited and oppressed by capitalist imperialism! They are tightly trapped in the darkness, not knowing that disaster is imminent.

Why is this? The suffering of illiteracy makes them lack knowledge, and long-term oppression and bondage have covered up their conscious hearts. Of course! They can't point out where the country's suffering is? Where is the nation's misfortune? Where is the world's crisis? So, the tragic story of the subjugated slave seems to them like an interesting news story. They have no awareness, they have been anesthetized for a long time!

How can these unawakened people recognize the great power of the group? They have been accustomed to a scattered life. They are still "you mind your own business, I mind my own business" when reading in the classroom, or speaking loudly at will, not knowing how to live in a group. But the great national salvation movement must be driven by the power of the group, resisting the enemy with a sound group, will have a great effect!

Undoubtedly, they need our encouragement and propaganda. We must educate them, organize them, and train them!

The above is what I have seen and deeply felt from being in a women's literacy class for a month. Wei, since you are a knowledgeable woman, then you should quickly take on this responsibility yourself and add a strong force to our teaching and salvation work.

### Plate

— Fang Hei

A white plate brought with a white napkin placed before me. I've long been tired of the use of knives and forks. Anxiously worrying about obstructive etiquette and obstructive hygiene. The plate of cold dishes is roughly and lightly constructed like a pagoda, with the top of the tower poured with greasy cream. I used a practiced fork to get the top of the tower from the plate, but the taste was like chewing a handful of dirt. The plate of cold dishes is gone.

After the cold dishes, the plate is replaced by a platter. Thick soup, which often makes our dinner rich, tempts my appetite. Steak, fried fish, and tender white chicken, their names are each recorded in lascivious French on the menu, giving me greedy grease and tough tendons. Potatoes and carrots, lettuce and fruit sauce are seasoning dishes, fresh and unpalatable. As skilled as eating a plate of curry chicken, the use of knives and forks has passed again.

The delicious food that I felt could only be obtained in precious platters or bowls appeared on a plate for daily life with cantaloupe and peanuts. Its name is also recorded in lascivious French on the menu. It's a kind of dessert made of cream. When I tried it with a small teaspoon, I felt like it had the sourness of lemon. Then, among the messy tableware, the plate, eaten clean, revealed its round, glazed, even face. There are no colored patterns of dai flowers or red flowers, or ingenious patterns, only a golden thread waving along the wave-shaped edge. The plate casts a mixed round shadow on the white tablecloth, as if revealing a round smile. To the diners tired of life, she has the mission of pleasing people, she has no greedy grease, it is a kind of sweet and sour jelly, and she shows her round, glazed, even face, as if deliberately pretending to be round with a smile.

I have long been tired of the use of knives and forks, and I don't have a good appetite for such an expensive dinner; but this white, mixed-round plate makes me happy. Above my head, fifty candlelight bulbs in the lampshade project a round, blended light. I hear the irritating taste of nicotine temporarily numbing my fingers.

The plate casts a mixed round shadow on the white tablecloth, as if revealing a round smile.

### The Recent Situation of the World-Sensation Quintuplets

— Xu Li

Two years ago, a village woman in Ontario, Canada, gave birth to quintuplets, shocking the world. Fox Film Corporation of America even brought her story to the screen, producing a film called "The Country Doctor," which we have already enjoyed. Now, the second film starring these five little girls has been released and will soon be screened in Shanghai. The Chinese title of the new film is "Grand Reunion." In addition to the five girls, Kean Harshaw will still play the male lead.

These five little girls are now four years old. Their upbringing, I believe, is worth introducing.

These five lovely twin sisters are named Yvonne, Marie, Cecile, Annette, and Emilie. They celebrated their third birthday on New Year's Day this year. Their hair is already golden and lovely, and their eyes are bright, showing intelligence. They are being raised using scientific methods, with a nursery and sunbathing. Their development is measured at all times, so the five sisters are all plump and cute. The state government has appointed four legal guardians to care for them, with Dr. Dafoe and two female nurses actually taking on the responsibility of raising them. The doctor, nurses, and quintuplets are like a family. They call the doctor Dad and the nurse Mom. They really treat the doctor and nurses as their parents because their biological parents, the Dionne couple, are not allowed to meet them without a pane of glass separating them.

From January of last year to this year, they have grown an average of 2.5 inches and gained 72.6 ounces each. They have now learned several basic dances. Dr. Dafoe, who is responsible for raising them, has put in a great deal of effort over these two years.

The best developed is Yvonne, weighing 3.388 kg and measuring 2.78 feet tall. Next are Cecile and Annette, both weighing 3.388 kg and measuring 2.76 feet tall. Emilie weighs 3.0148 kg and is 2.74 feet tall. The weakest is Marie, whose survival was once doubted, but she now weighs 1.0904 kg and is 2.7 feet tall.

Two years ago, the village of Ontario held the miraculous birth of the quintuplets. Because of the suddenness, Dr. Dafoe was at a loss. Then, women from the village sympathetically donated some money. Just as they were struggling to make ends meet, the Chicago American Exposition recognized and donated US$50,000. After that, the five sisters formed an inextricable bond with gold and embarked on a happy journey envied by the world. As a result, their total income in two years has reached US$500,000. For example, last year's income was US$250,000, of which US$200,000 was the compensation for appearing in the film. Other income, such as from using their images for advertising milk, soap, and other products, amounted to about US$50,000.

Last summer, as many as 495,000 tourists from various countries visited them in Ontario in admiration of the miraculous quintuplets. Their village of Callander has become a world-famous scenic spot. Their biological father opened a souvenir shop and sold souvenirs of the quintuplets to visitors.

### Anecdotes from "Elastic Daughter"

The dance halls that are everywhere in the city are also affected by the sluggish market situation. The slow business, of course, affects the lives of the dancers. Lu Ming in "Elastic Daughter" couldn't exchange the 50 yuan dance ticket she earned from dancing at the New Metropolitan Dance Hall for cash. However, the rent at home, her younger brother's tuition, and the installments on her debt are all weighing on a woman of limited ability. However, this is often the case for women who make a living by dancing.

Yu Guang, a bank clerk, doesn't earn much either. In addition to covering his personal living expenses, he can't take care of all the expenses at home. However, going to dance halls is also a necessary place for him. He actually met Zhu Qiuhen, a dancer at the New Metropolitan Dance Hall, and even intends to marry her, but he often feels strapped for cash. Under these circumstances, Yu Guang becomes bold and misappropriates public funds. As a result, the incident is discovered and he is arrested and imprisoned. "Elastic Daughter" is a clear example for young people who frequent dance halls and do not have a stable life.

### Seeking Drama Comrades

The Firefly Society, a comprehensive group that includes culture, drama, and singing, must not be entirely unfamiliar to the public!

Recently, its drama and singing departments have decided to broadcast majestic songs and national defense dramas every Monday starting from the 22nd of this month at the Ministry of Communications Radio Station. However, they feel that they do not have enough dramatic talent and are planning to rehearse, so they are now publicly seeking drama comrades. Any young person, male or female, who is interested in drama work and can speak or has a slight understanding of Mandarin can apply in writing to Mr. Han Bai of the Jianghai Customs Examination Department.
