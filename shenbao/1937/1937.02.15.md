During my previous trip to North China and now passing through Xi'an, I witnessed scenes of the Northeasterners' miserable lives. After seeing them, besides shedding endless tears of sympathy, I always think: the pain of losing one's country is unbearable!

Once, while passing through Dongjiaomin Lane in Beiping, I saw an older rickshaw puller pointing at a certain foreigner who had left triumphantly and complaining to a policeman as if he was in urgent need: "I pulled him from Xizhimen, which is far away, and he shamelessly pretended to have taken the wrong route and left without paying a single cent!" The policeman only glanced at the back of the foreigner who had gone a little further away and, using the excuse of directing traffic for the cars, raised his baton and told the rickshaw puller to move away quickly. However, the rickshaw puller, with a bitter and defeated look, still wanted to ask for something. Another younger rickshaw puller, probably having seen that the policeman was following the policy of good neighborliness and could not help, angrily advised him: "Who told you to be blind and pull a ×× foreigner?" The first rickshaw puller sighed "Ai" as if knowing who that person was: "Fellow villager! I am old and have not been a volunteer soldier like you, killing ×× foreigners. How can I tell them apart at once?" Both of them had Northeastern accents, and one of them must have been a former volunteer soldier.

In Beiping, I stayed at a friend's house. A Northeastern family lived across the street. As soon as they heard the "Tie, tie, tie" sound of a small drum passing by on the street, the woman or children in the family would shout loudly, "Drum player—drum player—" and call him into the house. One day, the furniture and belongings of their family were suddenly piled in the middle of the street. The whole family, seven people of all ages, huddled together shivering in the cold wind. The children cried strangely from the cold, and the old woman, amidst the insults of the landlord demanding rent, suddenly made up her mind, grabbed a policeman who was there to help the landlord and said: "Go! Go to the Public Security Bureau, are you trying to freeze us to death or starve us to death?" But the Public Security Bureau was not a shelter from the cold, nor was it a soup kitchen. The policeman only wanted to scare them to solve the problem, but unexpectedly, he scared himself and could not back down. The reporter then took on the role of Lu Zhonglian and persuaded the landlord to let them go back home to stay temporarily.

The next morning, the old woman's eldest son unexpectedly came to visit with a pair of black long boots. According to his hesitant words: he had a brother who was very capable and worked under Brigadier Qin Guangdi's (秦光第?) command. In the 19th year of the Republic, he fought against Russia and unfortunately died in battle at the same time as the brigadier. His family was "a family of farmers and scholars," and he himself farmed in the countryside of Jilin, with hundreds of acres of fertile land, which could have supported his family with surplus. However, after the September 18th Incident, the Japanese came to the countryside to investigate the household registration, insisting that his brother was still engaged in illegal activities in other villages and forced him to hand him over. Among the villagers, many had already been arrested and killed inexplicably for unfounded things; he had no choice but to abandon his business and enter the interior. He sent a letter to entrust someone to sell his property and do business, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea. All the good things had been sold and eaten. Finally, he pointed to the boots with embarrassment and said: "Please, sir, this is the only relic of my brother. I have asked several 'drum players' to look at them, but they are not worth a cent. Please, sir, help me take them? Alas—there is really no way!" It was truly heartbreaking to hear.

At that time, the reporter had visited the shelters in Beiping. How many people were huddled in the messy nests there? I can't remember. However, the manager said: most of them spoke with a Northeastern accent. There were also shelters in Tianjin, which were destroyed by fire, and the remains of the corpses were piled up like an ant mound. Needless to say, many of them were the heroic souls from the land of white mountains and black waters!

The judgment of crimes seems to be different at home and abroad. Especially for the death penalty, it seems to be easier to sentence in China than in foreign countries. During the suppression of bandits in Hunan, one place reported a list of many people who were half-banditized. A certain commander drew a large circle on it and ruled: those within the circle shall be executed. It was as if he had stepped on a nest of ants with one foot. Also, when Europeans and Americans carry out the death penalty, they often execute it in the early morning without anyone noticing. When the death penalty is carried out in China, some people fire several iron cannons with a roar, some play mournful and miserable bugle calls, and drag the prisoners through the streets. All the barbaric and brutal atrocities of mankind can be said to have been exposed. Saying that it is not enough to warn the rest in this way, but "a murderer pays with his life," how many examples have there been since ancient times? Is there anyone who commits a crime who does not know this? Even stranger: people cannot bear to see a sheep or a cow tremble when it is killed; some people will madly chase after the execution to watch, and I don't know what their psychology is like? The reporter is most afraid of encountering executions, but when traveling to the inland border, he often encounters them; the most piercing thing was a scene in Chahar:

"Damn it, you get shot for snatching a meal! Damn it, you get shot for snatching a meal!" This was a military agency, tying up four prisoners to be executed. Among them was a young man of about seventeen or eighteen years old, who walked while looking back every step of the way, cursing like this. Combining their crimes and the true meaning of the rumors, they were originally "volunteer soldiers from Rehe," whose teams were scattered by the Japanese and puppet troops. They fled to northern Chahar and walked towards a group of farmers eating on the ridges of cultivated land; because their clothing was suspicious, the farmers mistakenly abandoned their food and fled. They had not seen a grain of rice for several days and were hungry, so they ate a full meal; unexpectedly, the security team surrounded them from all directions... "Damn it, you get shot for snatching a meal!" This was already the past after the end of the Great Wall War of Resistance, but whenever I encounter similar incidents of Northeasterners wandering and being bullied, it is as if I hear their voices.

Xi'an, the birthplace of the Shaanxi Incident that shook the world, is the former capital of seven dynasties, including Zhou, Qin, Han, Western Wei, Northern Zhou, Sui, and Tang. A pagoda (such as the Double Wild Goose Pagoda), a temple (such as the Kaiyuan Temple), a bridge (such as the Ba Bridge), and a stele (such as any stele in the Stele Forest) are all related to historical records and documents, and are enough to evoke a sense of nostalgia. The reporter revisited Xi'an this time, just on the eve of the outbreak of the incident, and all the feelings made me sadly think of Shenyang before September 18th. As soon as I arrived in Xi'an, it was Northeasterners who asked for business cards and looked at the luggage; when unloading at the Xijing Guesthouse, whether in the corridor, in the living room, or in the dining room, the number of times I encountered Northeasterners was always more than the number of times I encountered local people and people from other provinces. Their way of talking naturally formed a faction: military men always had the tone of "when the Marshal was in charge, how was the Young Marshal." Bureaucrats also liked to criticize the habits of people from the North and South, such as saying: "Southerners are lively, have quick minds, and their intelligence is something that Northerners cannot match; but when faced with major events and great difficulties, they hesitate and worry, and cannot make decisions for a long time, which is their shortcoming. If the military and political power of the Sino-Japanese issue were in the hands of Northerners, it would have been fought long ago." Young people in Western suits and leather shoes also liked to boast about the civilization of the countries where they studied. If you are a well-dressed newcomer, they will not hesitate to ask "Your surname" and "Your home" to open the conversation, and then use "A certain gentleman from your province, I think you also know" to turn a corner, and then introduce the topic, such as saying: "A certain gentleman has traveled to Europe and America, and met me at a certain university in Berlin..." If they are students who studied in Japan, they often say: "These Japanese brats are extremely powerful and often use the name of subsidies and special expenses to buy us off to go back to the puppet country to be obedient people, or to enter the interior to do something, which is really a toad wanting to eat swan meat." Yes, when Zhang Xueliang was in the Northeast, he tried his best to recruit all the students who had studied in Europe, America, and Japan, so the counselors and secretaries of various military and political institutions, the members and editors of the Northeast Cultural Committee, and the professors and lecturers of Northeast University were all counted in numbers and were more talented than capable. At that time, the building equipment of the auditorium, hall, and dormitory of the Shenyang YMCA, as well as the people who gathered, rested, and traveled there, were similar to the scene in the Xijing Guesthouse at this time; however, the Shenyang YMCA at that time was filled with joyful air, and the Xijing Guesthouse today is filled with resentment.

Let's talk about it from another angle: going north from the Xijing Guesthouse, you can reach the East Station of the Longhai Railway after leaving the city gate. Passengers getting on and off the train and luggage handling often have to go through three hands, which is of course particularly troublesome; but someone will advise you: "Just treat it as helping the Northeasterners!" Turning back and walking south past the "Public Entertainment Place," what entertainment is there? It is simply a barracks and a stable. What there is are the messy street stalls in the open space outside the gate. There are two types of businesses that are doing well, but the customers are mostly Northeasterners: one is a used clothing stall, where Northeasterners take off their felt hats and leather robes and sell them to the stall; but in a blink of an eye, they are bought by their fellow villagers. One is a fortune-telling stall, as the saying goes, "the rich calculate their horoscopes and the poor look at their faces." Northeasterners running to the Northwest are of course eager to find work; but in the Northwest, it is already felt that there is too little porridge and too many monks, so how easy is it to find work? If you can't find it, blame fate, and naturally you will patronize the fortune-teller. Turning onto Dadong Street and other major streets, there are many newly opened Tianjin restaurants, especially clothing stores and grocery stores opened by Northeasterners, which are filled with Northeastern accents. The reporter once had dinner at a popular Tianjin restaurant, and the guests who were talking about national affairs were all Northeasterners. Suddenly, three Northeasterners came to raise donations, saying that a certain famous fellow villager had come here with his family for the first time, failed to find work, died in poverty, and was in dire straits after his death. After the donations were raised, everyone was afraid of being deceived. In fact, even if it was a scam, the three people were also acting out of desperation! The Northeastern patriot Che Xiangchen, whom the reporter met during the Great Wall War, repeatedly went out of the country to engage in volunteer army activities. Now, because of failure, he came to Xi'an. He saw many children of his fellow villagers playing on the streets outside Dongguan all day long and couldn't bear it. He first rented a broken house with two yuan and gathered them to study. In a short time, there were more than 260 people, but most of them were poor fellow villagers who couldn't afford tuition! How pitiful! Truly pitiful, my Northeastern compatriots after the loss of our province! After this Shaanxi Incident, it is even worse! What about the 30 million compatriots who were abandoned outside the border, left to be trampled on!

Current Affairs Commentary

### Expectations for the Third Plenary Session

— Yi

The Fifth Central Executive Committee's Third Plenary Session opens today. This meeting will make specific decisions on the major plans for the current party and country. Its importance is widely known to the people of the country. But there is still something that can attract the attention of the world. That is, at the time of this gathering, the repeated victories of the slow and distant War of Resistance have made national self-confidence even stronger. And the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident has also hinted to the world that China is an indivisible and unified country. Regarding this meeting that domestic and foreign people are paying attention to, we would like to express a few earnest expectations during the opening period.

First, regarding diplomacy, the declaration of the Fifth National Congress stated: "We are in a period of serious national crisis. What we hold to deal with the crisis is to uphold the two great posthumous teachings of the Premier, 'Man will conquer nature' and 'What is in our own hands will survive, what is in the hands of others will perish,' with the greatest patience and determination to protect the survival of our country and the path to national revival." This diplomatic principle set by the Congress is very appropriate. Since the Second Plenary Session, Foreign Minister Zhang has been negotiating with the Japanese side with great patience to adjust the relations between the two countries. However, because Japan has always lacked sincerity, after several months of negotiations, only two incidental cases have been concluded. As for the fundamental relations between the two countries, not only have they not been adjusted in the slightest, but they have become more deteriorated due to the signing of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact and the expiration of the Far East Treaty. Now, the restoration of our lost territory in the Northeast is still very distant, and the crisis in North China is intensifying. To deal with the oppression of strong neighbors and protect the survival of the nation, we have to resort to the greatest determination. The central officials must quickly adapt to the current international situation and establish a far-reaching and concrete diplomatic policy. This is our most urgent expectation for this plenary session.

Second, regarding people's livelihood, since the National Government has been promoting economic construction, it has indeed made remarkable achievements in finance, water conservancy, transportation, agriculture, mining, and other aspects. However, generally speaking, economic construction is still far from enabling the people's lives to receive sufficient benefits. The poverty and unemployment of people in various places are still widespread phenomena. Last year, most parts of the country claimed to have a bumper harvest, but some provinces and regions were still experiencing food shortages. Although this can be said to be due to the fact that economic construction has not yet become widespread, the fact that those in charge of construction in the past each pursued their own interests and were eager for quick success is also an important reason. We earnestly hope that this plenary session will not only make a thorough review of the various mistakes in past economic construction but also re-formulate a practical and sound plan for the country's economic construction in the future based on the results of overall planning. It is essential to ensure that the efforts made by the government in construction in the future will be enjoyed by the people, bit by bit.

Third, regarding civil rights, the Fifth National Congress, in order to cultivate civil rights, had a resolution to convene the National Assembly and formulate a constitution within the 25th year of the Republic of China. Last winter, due to changes in the domestic situation, the National Assembly was postponed indefinitely. The central officials will naturally have appropriate resolutions on this important issue at the Third Plenary Session, so there is no need for us to be loquacious. However, we believe that regardless of whether constitutional governance is sooner or later, it is necessary for the central government to adopt public opinion as much as possible in order to overcome difficulties at the moment. Therefore, we earnestly hope that as a result of this meeting, within the scope of not endangering the country, the central government can allow as much freedom of speech as possible.

The above three points are originally ordinary wishes that have been accumulated in the hearts of the people for a long time. Now we are re-proposing them, simply because they are more likely to be realized in this period of national unity.

### The Japanese Parliament, Which Has Been Suspended Several Times, Reopens Today

It is generally expected that no serious twists and turns will occur. Prime Minister Hayashi will announce the policy direction.

[Tokyo] On the 15th, the Third Plenary Session of our country opened. The Japanese Parliament, which had been suspended three times, also reconvened on this day. This parliamentary session lasted for three weeks. Due to the change of cabinet, no bill was finally discussed. General observations here all believe that after the parliament reopens tomorrow, it is unlikely that any serious twists and turns will occur. Regarding finance, the Hayashi Senjuro cabinet intends to reduce the previous draft budget as much as possible within its power, and at the same time change the tax increase plan. This point is attracting attention throughout the country, but it is not without criticism, because Yūki Toyotaro's policy is beneficial to capitalists and urban people. However, compared with Baba Eiichi's draft, it is still moderate, because the original budget draft has in fact no room for fundamental changes, and the payment of military expenses cannot be reduced by a single word. Therefore, the Japanese people will temporarily endure it within the prescribed scope. The Hayashi Cabinet has no intention of dissolving the parliament, and the army also tends to take a cautious and wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, if no unfortunate problems occur, the parliamentary session is expected to pass safely. As for political parties, the Social Democratic Party advocates the dissolution of the parliament, and the Minseito seems to think that maintaining the status quo is the best policy. Although there are many anti-government factions in the Seiyukai, the opinions of the main members are all unwilling to cause more twists and turns and increase the complexity of the situation. The movement to reorganize the old party and create a new party in the Seiyukai is also difficult to succeed due to the lack of a suitable leader. Regarding the Hayashi Cabinet's anti-parliamentary politics and anti-party ideas, the Seiyukai and Minseito will raise sharp questions. Whether unfortunate events and disputes can be avoided depends mostly on how the cabinet answers. Considering that only Hayashi Senjuro, Yamazaki Tatsunosuke, and Kodama Kenji among the nine cabinet members have parliamentary experience, if they fail to answer the questions raised properly, there is a risk of causing a head-on conflict with the political parties. Therefore, no one can predict whether the parliament can be exempted from dissolution. The so-called unique constitutional government and the so-called "unity of festival and administration" advocated by the Hayashi Cabinet will be the most difficult questions for the cabinet to answer, and all parties are uneasy about it. Generally, it is also feared that the cabinet will not be able to give satisfactory explanations on other points, such as the purpose of military reform and the strategy of diplomatic unification. It is heard that Hayashi Senjuro's speech in the parliament tomorrow will focus on economic cooperation with China, which is more noteworthy because it seems to be somewhat different in substance from the three principles held by the Hirota and Arita eras. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)

[Nanjing] The parliament will reopen tomorrow, and there will be Prime Minister Hayashi's speech on the policy direction and diplomatic speech, and Minister of Finance Yūki's speech on finance. As for the Hayashi Cabinet's administration, it will be fully reviewed before the people, so the situation of this parliamentary session is extremely noteworthy. Prime Minister Hayashi, who advocates a unified administration, and Minister of Finance Yūki, who greatly reduced Baba's budget, will both demonstrate their skills in this parliamentary session to show their experience. Moreover, the characteristic of this parliamentary session is that the new cabinet has no relationship with political parties at all. Therefore, there will be a major impact on the relationship between the government and political parties in the parliament, and at the same time, it will have a major impact on the movement of the political situation. At the provisional cabinet meeting on the 13th, the government decided on the methods of war and peace to deal with the parliament. On the political party side, the Minseito is scheduled to convene a joint meeting of the budget committee and party executives on the 14th. The Seiyukai will also convene a general affairs meeting, an executive meeting, and a general meeting of members on the same day. The Social Democratic Party, the National League, and the Toho Kai will also convene general meetings of members to determine the attitude of each party and refresh their lineup. It is expected that intense debates will be unfolded on matters such as the budget plan, military expenses, the issue of leaving the party when negotiating entry into the cabinet, and the belief in a new administration. Although it is generally believed that this parliamentary session will not be dissolved, the new party movement may not stop here, and innovation movements will also occur within the political parties. Therefore, it is not yet possible to predict whether it will be dissolved, so the future of the 70th parliamentary session is still unknown. (Allied Press dispatch on the 14th)

[Nanjing] Viscount Watanabe Chifuyu of the House of Peers Research Association will raise questions about Prime Minister Hayashi's policy and diplomatic speech in the general meeting on the 15th, and will request to speak on the meaning of proceeding with the deliberation after the Minister of State's speech on the policy direction on the same day. (Allied Press dispatch on the 14th)

### Suma Lectures on Chinese Political Situation

Tokyo's various circles attach great importance to it

[Tokyo] Since returning to Tokyo, Suma, the former consul-general in Nanjing, has been repeatedly invited by various institutions and groups to give lectures on Chinese issues. All circles here believe that Suma has been stationed in China for eleven years and has participated in various important negotiations, so Suma's observations are regarded as important. Suma gave a lecture at the Mainichi Shimbun East Asia Research Association on "The Current Situation of the Nanjing Political System and the Future of Sino-Japanese Relations," praising the increasingly consolidated unification of China and the increasing discipline of the Chinese army. He also said that China's unification is due to the "Guangdong Spirit." According to this term, it is quite novel. Suma quoted a foreign person saying "Japan is like the setting sun, China is like the rising sun" when concluding, warning the audience. From now on, we should seriously pay attention to the relationship between China and Japan. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)

### President Quezon of the Philippines Arrives in the United States

Naval and military officers welcomed him as usual. Cannons were fired as a salute to pay respect.

Los Angeles. President Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth arrived here from Manila today. Fort MacArthur fired a nineteen-gun salute to pay respect. Many naval and military officers welcomed him. Quezon said that his talks with President Roosevelt would mainly discuss the reciprocal trade agreement. The situation in the Philippines was very good last year. The government budget can balance income and expenditure. The Philippines has made considerable preparations for national defense. However, all the rumors about Japan's ambitions are unfounded. The Philippines' plan is to make it unprofitable for others to attack it. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 13th)

### 1937 Handbook of World Politics

Published in New York. The Philippines is listed among the nations.

[New York] The 1937 "Handbook of World Politics" has been published today, listing the Philippine Commonwealth as another country. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 13th)

### Excluding the Invasion of Japanese Power into the Philippines

American congressmen plan to propose suggestions to give Filipinos preferential tax treatment and develop the resources of Mindanao.

[Washington] Republican Congressman Cliffore told the Associated Press today that next Thursday he will ask Congress to consider a plan to consolidate US-Philippine economic relations before the independence of the Philippine Islands. Cliffore went on to say that since President Quezon will arrive here soon, Congress should promptly and solemnly consider future trade relations and give non-people at least the preferential treatment obtained after Cuba's independence. Cliffore further said that if the United States cannot occupy a seat in the Philippine market and stand by and watch the Japanese arrange the future economic foundation, it can be said to be very foolish. He will ask Congress to analyze the report of the tariff committee, and he disagrees with many points in the report. Cliffore predicts that if the Philippines can obtain Cuba's preferential tax rate, its sugar industry will surely prosper and grow after independence. Cliffore believes that the Mindanao area has not yet been developed, and the resources contained in it are richer than Luzon. However, if the United States and the Philippines do not step up their efforts, Mindanao will inevitably not be preserved because the penetration of Japanese power is very alarming. He firmly believes that Mindanao has a lot of gold, and if it can be properly cultivated after independence, the coconut oil industry will be able to be preserved. Mindanao's climate is ideal and it is not subject to hurricanes. Mindanao alone is enough to support 2.5 million people, but I am afraid that when its true value is estimated, Japan will have already intervened. Cliffore concluded that Mindanao's production costs are very low and may become the economic lifeline of the Philippines in the future. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 12th)

### Internal Discord in the Soviet Union Against Stalin

Expanding Trend – News from a Japanese Dispatch

[Tokyo] The internal Soviet conspiracy against Stalin and the investigation involving the Ordnance Headquarters are gradually developing. According to a public telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, profound friction has recently occurred within the Communist Party, the Red Army, and the Soviet government, considered the greatest crisis since the establishment of the current regime in 1917. As many as 10,000 people have been arrested for their involvement in the anti-Stalin movement, including many core members of the Communist Party and Red Army officers. The anti-Stalin conspiracy has infiltrated various aspects, gradually endangering the foundation of the state. Furthermore, it is said that Foreign Affairs People’s Commissar Litvinov’s wife has recently been arrested. There are also rumors that Stalin and Red Army Commander Voroshilov have fallen out, and General Voroshilov will soon resign, with General Bulyonny, the Far Eastern Army Commander, succeeding him. Others say Litvinov will be expelled from Moscow and appointed ambassador to France or Italy. On the 11th, a dispatch from the Moscow AP reported the alleged arrest of acting National Defense People’s Commissar Shatsky and others. Although the Soviet government has historically been extremely strict about inspecting foreign telegrams, it is now tacitly acknowledging the report, indicating the Soviet government's acknowledgement of its internal upheaval. However, this upheaval is not merely due to the conspiracy of the Trotskyites; issues such as food shortages and labor dissatisfaction with Stalin have also contributed to the expansion and intensification of the situation. Moscow experienced riots on the 4th of this month due to food shortages and the arrest of anti-Stalinists. Tank units were mobilized to suppress the uprising, reportedly resulting in 14 deaths and 40 injuries. Judging from the various situations described above, the internal Soviet turmoil is indeed trending towards expansion. (Alliance Dispatch, 14th)

### Britain Urgently Needs Steel for Naval Expansion

Construction of Giant Liners to Be Temporarily Suspended – The "Manly" Suffers Minor Loss Due to Carelessness

[London] The British giant liner "Queen Mary" caught fire last night, but there was no significant damage. It will set sail next Wednesday. According to the Glasgow newspaper, the implementation of the naval expansion plan will require a large amount of steel, and the construction of the “Mary’s” sister ship may be temporarily suspended. (National Dispatch, 13th)

### League of Nations Conference on Trafficking in Women and Children Passes Resolution to Abolish Public Prostitution

Proposes Establishment of Agency in the Far East for Collecting and Exchanging Information

Java, Bandoeng – The League of Nations Conference on Trafficking in Women and Children, currently meeting here, passed a resolution today endorsing the abolition of public prostitution. Among other recommendations, it proposed the establishment of an agency in the Far East to collect and exchange information on this matter, and to establish contact with the Chinese government and countries with concessions in China for the purpose of exchanging information. The Conference also strongly advocated improvements in ship management and cooperation with shipping companies and local port authorities. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 13th)

### Important Speech by Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg on the Patriotic Front's Position

Changing the Form of Government is a Major Matter, Inadvisable to Act Hastily – Pro-German Groups' Activities to Be Banned

[Vienna] This afternoon, Chancellor Schuschnigg delivered a speech to 1,500 leaders of the Patriotic Front from across Austria in the former Federal Council Hall, outlining the Patriotic Front's position on the issue of the Habsburg restoration. The gist can be divided into three points: ① Respect for Austria's historical traditions, ② Only the Austrian people have the right to decide on the form of government they adopt according to the constitution, ③ The form of government is a major issue and should not be attempted lightly. He said, "Royalists engaging in restoration propaganda must be integrated with Austria's new domestic and foreign policy. If the time is not right, it is not advisable to act rashly. Moreover, only the Austrian rulers have the right to decide when to hold a referendum to resolve the form of government. This approach is not only beneficial to the people and the country but also beneficial to the Habsburgs." Referring to the activities of pro-German factions in the country, Schuschnigg advocated prohibiting various cultural groups recently established, saying, "Recently, people from all walks of life, especially those in the cultural sector, have suggested establishing the 'German Social Cultural Alliance.' While I personally do not doubt this suggestion, it is likely to conflict with the Patriotic Front and cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I believe that this and other similar groups are inappropriate at this time." Finally, he appealed to the Austrian working class, saying, "I have deep and unlimited trust in the Austrian workers." When the Chancellor mentioned banning pro-German groups, the entire audience applauded thunderously. (Havas, 14th)

[Vienna] Political observers have commented on the Austrian Chancellor's speech, believing that as German Foreign Minister Neurath is about to visit Austria on the 20th of this month, Chancellor Schuschnigg intends to ban pro-German groups in the country, and while there is some encouragement for restorationists, he also takes the opportunity to warn them not to act too hastily. The nature of his actions is extremely important. (Havas)

### Final Battle for Madrid Begins

Artillery Fire Resounds on Both Banks of the Jarama River – Road to Valencia Cut Off – National Defense Council Urges Government to Take Decisive Measures

Rabat – Radio Córdoba broadcast a message today stating that the Nationalist forces have occupied Arganda, a town on the Valencia highway, which is now completely cut off. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 14th)

Madrid – Today, thousands of Nationalist troops, with Moroccan cavalry as the vanguard, advanced towards the Garabitas front line, marking the beginning of the university's effort to capture Madrid. Government troops defended with hand grenades, reportedly repelling the enemy with heavy losses. At the same time, aircraft from both sides engaged in fierce aerial combat. The National Defense Council announced that it had shot down three enemy fighter planes. The government army today introduced a conscription plan, requiring all residents of Madrid aged 20 to 40 to serve. The National Defense Council has sent two representatives to Valencia to request the government to issue military service orders. It is reported that the government will also appoint a commander-in-chief to command the armies on the central front in order to defend against the Nationalist forces. (National Dispatch, 14th)

Avila – Our correspondent, Tausby Dart, reports that after crossing the Jarama River southeast of Madrid yesterday, the Nationalist forces encountered the 15th International Brigade (composed of leftists from various countries) of the government army. The brigade fought to the death, defending every inch of ground, and although they were eventually defeated and suffered many casualties, their tenacious resistance was unprecedented for the Nationalist forces. (Havas, 13th)

Avila – Our correspondent, Tausby Dart, reports that after occupying high ground near the Valencia highway in the Jarama River area south of the capital yesterday, the Nationalist forces have reached the village of Arganda. By today, their position there has become more secure, and all roads leading from Arganda to Morata de Tajuña are controlled by the Nationalist forces. In addition, government forces launched a counterattack on the town of Garabitas southwest of the capital yesterday but were repelled by the Nationalist forces. The Nationalist authorities believe that the main battle is currently focused on the Jarama River area, and this tactic of the government forces is intended to disperse the Nationalist forces' strength in order to contain the fighting in the river area. (Havas, 14th)

Valencia – Sources from Madrid report that the corridor between Madrid and Valencia has recently narrowed to only 25 miles, causing anxiety within the government. The pressure from the Nationalist forces is strong, especially from the west. However, recent reports indicate that government forces are defending to the death, determined not to allow the Nationalist forces to close this corridor. The communists and socialists in Valencia are preparing to convene a mass rally, demanding that the government immediately implement compulsory mobilization of all able-bodied men. The difficulties faced by families in Madrid, namely the lack of fuel, have made it impossible for them to cook, and branches and wood chips have become precious family treasures, seized upon by those who find them for cooking. A Reuters reporter who returned from the front line on the road between Madrid and Valencia last night reported that the road has not yet been cut off by the Nationalist forces, but they are heavily bombarding the area. Furthermore, the Madrid Defense Committee has prepared a report on the local situation and sent three representatives to Valencia. The road to Valencia is the city's lifeline, and both sides are fiercely contesting control of it. According to a statement issued by the Supreme National Defense Council, artillery fire is continuous in the Jarama River area, and the fighting is the fiercest. It is reported that after repelling the Moroccan cavalry and German mechanized units of the rebels, the government forces launched a continuous counterattack under the cover of the air force, occupying an important location near the Barrage Mountains overlooking the Valencia highway. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 14th)

### Demonstration by Various Parties in the Spanish Government

Demanding Four Things from the Government – Vowing to Fight to the End

Valencia – Members of the Republican, Socialist, and Communist parties here held a large-scale demonstration in the streets today, immediately putting forward the following demands: ① National mobilization, ② Unified military command, ③ Granting all power to the government, ④ All men in the country who are able to carry arms must serve in compulsory military service, ⑤ Intensify the construction of defensive works along the coast, ⑥ Establish a strong military industry, and so on. After the demonstration, they will submit a petition to the government, requesting it to take the necessary measures mentioned above and to win a victory against the Nationalist forces. Military operations on the front line were very calm yesterday. Although the Nationalist forces launched an attack and the government forces also launched a counterattack, there were no changes in the positions of either side in the Jarama River area southeast of Madrid. In addition, according to news from Gijón in the northwest, the Nationalist warship "España" appeared off the coast of Asturias. According to news from Barcelona in the northeast, two foreign warships shelled the city yesterday, injuring several people. (Havas, 14th)

### Spanish Foreign Minister Denounces Italian and German Interference

Why Do the Powers Remain Indifferent?

Valencia – Foreign Minister Alvarez del Vayo delivered a radio address to the nation yesterday, stating, "At the request of the German staff in Burgos, Germany and Italy are continuing to send large numbers of troops, and it is reported that Germany and Italy are effectively occupying Spanish territory, which is a serious violation of the non-intervention agreement. Will the other governments participating in the London Adjustment Committee continue to turn a blind eye, and only impose legal sanctions after Germany and Italy have achieved their goals? This is something I cannot help but doubt. Last July, Germany and Italy were slow to join the non-intervention agreement, ignoring and mocking the other signatory countries to the agreement, until the number of German and Italian armaments flowing into Spain increased, and they believed that the rebels could win with this assistance. Only then did they state their attitude. They knew that the loyalty and bravery of our people were beyond the expectations of Germany and Italy, so they believed that manpower assistance to the rebels was also necessary. German Aviation Minister Göring then requested that 80,000 troops be sent to our country. He believed that just a few divisions from Germany and Italy could save the rebels from defeat. Up to now, the two countries want the troops necessary for the rebels to win to land in our country before implementing the monitoring measures. Their trick is very obvious. The democratic countries of Western Europe have already been deceived once, can they be deceived again? The rebel leader Franco outwardly claims to be the Supreme Commander of the Nationalist forces, but when the southern port of Málaga fell, he was eager to report to his leader, Italian leader Mussolini. The proclaimed 'national nature' of the rebels' actions is further demonstrated by this. As for the refugees fleeing from the port of Málaga, their numbers reach tens of thousands. The government has decided to provide emergency relief, and if necessary, will requisition bread made in cities in the rear to provide relief. In short, these refugees would rather walk hundreds of kilometers than fall into the hands of the rebels. If so, it is only right for those of us in the rear to tighten our belts and save food so that these refugees can have a full meal." (Havas, 14th)

### One-Tenth of Málaga Destroyed in Great Battle

Slaughter of Civilians Inhumane – Material Losses of £20 Million

Gibraltar – Today, a special correspondent for Reuters reported that the recent battle of Málaga destroyed more than one-tenth of the city, with total losses exceeding £20 million. There have been dozens of cases of smallpox, and deaths from this disease are reported daily. When the Nationalist forces bombed from the sea and air, the consulates of Britain, the United States, and Germany were severely damaged. According to an American couple who have resided in Málaga since the beginning of the war, they experienced 44 air raids after the town fell into the hands of the Reds. Respected residents and foreigners were greatly shocked, but the property of British and other foreigners was not disturbed. After the Nationalist forces occupied the city, they held a celebration in the park, attended by thousands of people. This was the first major gathering in seven months. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 14th)

[Paris] After the southern port of Málaga was captured by the Nationalist forces, there were reports of the slaughter of civilians. Six foreign correspondents in Madrid (three British, two American, and one French female correspondent), unable to bear witnessing the massacre of innocent civilians, jointly telegraphed French Prime Minister Blum, urging him to come forward and offer salvation based on humanitarian principles. (Havas, 13th)

Hong Kong – According to government sources, 9,500 people have been arrested in Málaga since it was occupied by the Nationalist forces, including the head of the left-wing military court. According to the Nationalist forces, this person previously sentenced 5,000 supporters of the right wing to death. (National Dispatch, 13th)

### German Legation in Burgos Upgraded

Salamanca – After Germany recognized the Nationalist government, it established a legation in Burgos, with General Faupel as chargé d'affaires. According to Nationalist authorities, the German legation has been upgraded to an embassy since yesterday. It is generally believed that Nationalist leader Franco will soon upgrade the legations in Germany and Italy to embassies as well. (Havas, 14th)

### Germany to Take a Further Step to Recover Danzig Sovereignty

Göring to Go to Warsaw for Negotiations – Offering Promises to Respect the Status Quo of the Corridor

[Berlin] Officials of the National Socialist Party recently declared that the return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany will soon be realized. German Aviation Minister Göring, at the invitation of Polish President Mościcki, will soon travel to Białowieża in Poland for a hunting trip. He has been instructed to conduct negotiations with Danzig Senate President Greiser and Polish foreign authorities, as the opportunity presents. It is reported that the German and Polish authorities may sign an agreement in the coming days, the contents of which stipulate that the Free City of Danzig should be returned to Germany, but on the other hand, German leader Hitler will provide the following two promises: namely, ① Respect the status quo of the Polish Corridor (formerly part of Germany, now within Polish territory), ② Guarantee that Poland can freely use the port of Danzig, the same as before the port was returned to Germany. Even if sovereignty over the Free City of Danzig is returned to Germany, its internal situation has not actually changed. The various opposition parties in the city have been banned from operating by the police, and their leaders have either been arrested and imprisoned or fled abroad. Its administrative power has been manipulated by the Senate, and the National Socialist Party occupies the majority of seats in the Senate. Although Hitler is not the administrative head of the city, he effectively controls the National Socialist Party, so the Free City of Danzig obeys Hitler's orders. Therefore, returning sovereignty over the city to Germany is merely a matter of form. (Havas, 14th)

### Vatican Newspaper Refutes German Propaganda Chief's Remarks

Acknowledges That Relations Have Indeed Developed with Spanish Rebels

Vatican City – After German Propaganda Minister Goebbels made accusations against the Vatican in a speech at the "Deutsche Haus" yesterday, the Vatican's "Osservatore Romano" published an article protesting, stating, "In view of the recent speeches by Pope Pius XI and the letters to Catholics issued by bishops from England, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the Catholic Church's attitude towards Bolshevism is clear and beyond doubt. As for the claim that there is no Vatican representative in Burgos, Spain, it is completely unfounded." By saying this, the newspaper has acknowledged that relations have indeed developed between the Vatican and the Spanish Nationalist government. This can also be confirmed in the Vatican's diplomatic yearbook. (According to the diplomatic yearbook, next to the names of the Vatican's chargé d'affaires in Spain, Bishop Silvio, and the Spanish Republic's ambassador to the Vatican, Surruda, the word "departed" is noted. Conversely, the Archbishop of Toledo (in Nationalist hands), Tomás, is listed in the yearbook as the Vatican's temporary informal representative in Burgos, and the Marquis of Magaz is listed as the Nationalist government's informal representative to the Vatican.) (Havas, 13th)

### German Colonial Question Studied from a Legal Perspective

[Berlin] The question of Germany's demand for the return of its former colonies has not yet been discussed among the countries concerned, but German legal scholars have now begun to study the legal system of the country's future colonies and to examine the impact that the National Socialist Party's racism may have on the legal status of the indigenous people of those colonies. Dr. Hanel, a well-known legal scholar, recently published an article criticizing the British colonial system, stating, "In the British colonies in Africa, administrative and judicial positions are mostly filled by black natives. The reason for this is that Britain lacks suitable personnel to develop Africa's vast resources, but we know from years of experience that the evolution of this system will become a real danger." Hanel then advocated that German young legal scholars should study the legislative system of British colonies in Africa. "This kind of preparation is very good, because once the time comes, Germany will not lack suitable personnel for the implementation of an effective colonial policy." (Havas, 13th)

### Iraq Invites Egypt to Join the League of Nations

[Geneva] The Iraqi government has sent a note to the Egyptian government stating, "We hereby sincerely request your country to apply to join the League of Nations." League of Nations officials were surprised to hear this, because it is the first time that a member of the League of Nations has openly invited a non-member country to submit an application for League of Nations membership. It is generally believed that this move by the Iraqi government is an action of solidarity among the Arab nations of the Near East. The Egyptian application to join the League of Nations will be passed by the League of Nations General Assembly at a temporary meeting in May. At that time, the issue of Italy's resumption of participation in the League of Nations will arise at the same time, or in other words, the issue of the Abyssinian representatives not being allowed to attend the League of Nations. Before the General Assembly meeting, the qualifications of the representatives of various countries will usually be reviewed first, and it is likely that the Abyssinian representatives will be rejected and not allowed to attend. If that happens, the various difficult issues caused by the Italian-Abyssinian war at the League of Nations General Assembly can be resolved. (Havas, 13th)

### Belgian Government to Issue New Public Bonds

Totaling 1.5 Billion Francs

Brussels – The government has now decided to issue domestic public bonds totaling 1,500,000,000 Belgian francs on the first of next month, with an interest rate of 3.5%, sold at 97% of face value. Finance Minister de Man issued a statement explaining the reasons for the issuance, stating that these bonds will be used to pay various temporary expenses and the surplus will be used to establish a "safety" fund, so that Belgium can be prepared in case the world economic situation deteriorates again. He also said that the national treasury has no immediate needs and that market interest rates are low, so now is a good time for the government to issue bonds. (Havas, 13th)

### US Judicial Reform Plan

White House Convenes Meeting of Senate Leaders

[Washington] President Roosevelt met with Senate leaders for half an hour today to discuss the reorganization of the federal judicial organization. The participants included Senators Harrison, Byrnes, Van Nuys, Burke, and King. The latter three opposed the president's plan. After the meeting, both sides said that their positions had not changed, but King said that he was quite satisfied with the president's views and would consider them. Senator Glass did not attend, believing that the president's plan was very strange, so he intended to oppose it in the Senate. (National Dispatch, 13th)

### Duke of Windsor Decides to Marry Mrs. Simpson

Wedding Scheduled for Early May – Sister and Brother Meet in Vienna

Cannes – It is generally believed here today that the Duke of Windsor will marry Mrs. Simpson in early May in the Riviera or Vienna. Everything has been decided, and only the date is still an issue. However, it is understood that the Duke's conversation with his sister did not involve the Duke's marriage. It is reported that the Duke and his sister discussed whether Mrs. Simpson can obtain the title of Duchess and "Her Highness." According to precedent, Mrs. Simpson would naturally be called Her Highness after marrying the Duke of Windsor, but Mrs. Simpson may give up these two titles in order to avoid difficult problems. (National Dispatch, 13th)

[London] The Associated Press learned today that when the Duke of Windsor spoke with his sister in Vienna, he said that he had decided to marry Mrs. Simpson and that he did not intend to return to England within a few years. His sister and her husband, Count Hochberg, left Vienna at 3:40 p.m. today to return to England. After arriving here, they will probably report everything to the Queen Mother, the King, and other members of the royal family. (National Dispatch, 13th)

### Japan and Egypt to Exchange Envoys

Cairo – Before announcing the news that the Egyptian government will send an ambassador to Japan, it has received a report that Japan has appointed an envoy to Egypt. (National News Agency, 13th)

### Conflicts Arise in US Auto Workers' Strike

Martial Law Declared in Madison City

[New York] Following yesterday's clashes between members and non-members of the Anderson United Automobile Workers union, resulting in ten serious injuries, martial law has now been declared in the entire county of Madison, including the cities of Anderson and Alexandria. Yesterday afternoon, three hundred workers from the Michigan State Sympathetic Union attempted to enter Alexandria in a motorcade to demonstrate, but were prevented by the defense forces. Subsequently, the defense forces searched the union headquarters and discovered three shotguns and several boxes of ammunition. It is reported that the Anderson General Motors factory employs a total of 11,000 workers, with only a very small number belonging to the union. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

### Neutral Chairman in Yunnan-Burma Boundary Demarcation Leans Towards British Side

Our Side Firmly Raises Objections, Prepares Evidence to Demand Revision

Kunming Dispatch: A telegram was recently received from the Boundary Demarcation Committee, reporting on the demarcation situation: ① Our Chinese members of the China-British Boundary Demarcation Committee, Liang Yu-gao and Zhang Zu-yin, and the staff of the office, arrived at Mao Nai Lao Chang on December 30th. The next day, they met with the neutral chairman and the British committee. The first boundary demarcation meeting was held at our camp on January 2nd. ② In the Yunnan-Burma boundary demarcation, our Chinese members met with the British side twice. The boundary line proposed by the British, from the second coordinate point to the third coordinate point, is not significantly different from the Scott Line. Our side maintains that for this section of the boundary line, from the second coordinate point, it should follow the watershed of the upper reaches of the Nam Wai River and the tributary of the Nam Ka River westward, cross the Nam Wai River, and then ascend Gongming Mountain (the local name of its highest peak is unknown), and then follow the mountain range southward, as stipulated in the treaty. However, since this mountain range is far from the second coordinate point, the treaty line should extend from the southeastern end of the mountain range, then cross the Bo Nan Ma River, and then follow the ridge between the Nam Ban River and the Nam Xu River outward, until the Nam Ka River at 22 degrees 30 minutes north latitude. However, the neutral chairman, although not yet deciding on this section of the treaty line, seems to sympathize with the British side. Our members are currently drafting a written justification and have prepared to propose revisions in accordance with the second responsibility of the outline of the tasks of this committee, to prevent any eventuality. ③ In the Yunnan-Burma boundary demarcation, on the morning of January 19th, the neutral committee and the Chinese and British committees met in the British camp. The neutral chairman discussed the treaty line proposed by both the Chinese and British sides from the second coordinate point to the third coordinate point, and ruled that the treaty line proposed by the British for this section should be the established line. Our side is now preparing to submit a dissenting opinion to the neutral committee's ruling, and in accordance with the second responsibility of the outline of the tasks of this committee, to present human and material evidence to demand revisions. As for the neutral chairman's ruling, the reason given was that the treaty line proposed by the British starts from the second coordinate point and follows the high mountain range dividing the Mekong and Salween Rivers southward to the third coordinate point. As for the line proposed by the Chinese side, it requires crossing the river westward from the second coordinate point for about forty miles, ascending Gongming Mountain, then crossing the river again, and then following the mountain range southward, which seems inconsistent with the local situation, and the third coordinate point reached by this line is on the bank of the Nam Ka River, which is inconsistent with the old position that the point should be on the easternmost ridge of the river. ④ In the Yunnan-Burma boundary demarcation, because the territory of Lancang County is closely related to the undetermined border, the Chinese office of the Demarcation Committee has specially appointed Li Wen-xin, the magistrate of the county, as the chief advisor and has submitted it to the provincial government for record. (February 5th)

### Foreign Ronin Counterfeit Legal Tender and Use it in Shantou

Counterfeiting Large Quantities of Twenty-Cent Subsidiary Coins; Manufacturing Facility Located in Fujian Province; Many Users Have Been Arrested

Shantou Dispatch: Foreign ronin have sneaked into the interior of Fujian and Guangdong, colluding with traitors, committing crimes, and doing all kinds of evil deeds, such as drug trafficking, gambling, spying, counterfeiting legal tender, disrupting finance, smuggling, tax evasion, etc., which are too numerous to mention. Xiong Ji-xia, the chief of the detective section of the Shantou Public Security Bureau, recently arrested seven criminals who were using twenty-cent subsidiary coins of the Central Bank. After interrogation by Xue Han-guang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, it was clearly confirmed that they were committed by foreign ronin. Their facility is located on the coast of Zhao'an County, Fujian Province. The counterfeit coins are printed by a foreign country and transported to Zhao'an by sailboats for sale. Three jiao (cents) can buy one yuan. The patterns and colors are not as beautiful and clear as the real ones. It is reported that there are also large amounts of one-yuan and five-yuan counterfeit legal tender being sold at a value of thirty to forty percent, in order to disrupt our country's monetary policy. The Shantou detective team, based on reports from informants, captured Wang Xi-qi and Huang Ke-xiang, who were selling the counterfeit coins, in a board house near the end of Qilu Shen Zhao Road near a certain consulate. Wang confessed to many accomplices, and Zhong Qing-quan, Wu Yu-zheng, Zhang Xi-man, Xie Tian-cai, Chen Jia-he, and others were arrested again. Six hundred and eighty-one counterfeit coins were found on Xie Tian-cai, ninety were found in Zhang Xi-man's home, and fifty were found in Zhong Qing-quan's home, totaling seven hundred and thirty-one. According to Xie et al., foreigners have sold more than 7,000 of these counterfeit coins in Shantou.

### Songjiang

Organizing Voluntary Police

The county government, in order to strengthen local defense forces, had proposed the organization of a voluntary police force. It had previously convened a meeting to prepare for it. The members are all graduates of junior high school or above with legitimate occupations or constant property. Ninety people were recruited into three squads, with the county magistrate as the squad leader and the police chief as the deputy squad leader. Two squads are the pistol squads, and one squad is the box gun squad. Uniforms and firearms are provided by the members themselves. The team headquarters is attached to the county government. The members must undergo conscript training.

### Suzhou

Smoking Addicts' Factory to be Established

The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to rectify the situation of detained opium addicts, is planning to establish the Second District Opium Addicts' Factory in Jiangsu Province. Xu Li-jiang has been appointed as the director. The factory site has been decided to be in Suzhou. After Xu contacted the county government, it has been determined that the original site of Penglai World on Wufu Road outside Xu Gate will be the factory site. In addition to some of the original houses that can still be used, dozens of new houses will be built to accommodate opium addicts. Preparations have been completed, and it is scheduled to be formally established on March 1st. It is also scheduled to recruit twenty guards on the 22nd of this month. After the establishment of the factory, opium addicts from the eight counties of Wu County, Wuxi, Changshu, Changzhou, Wujiang Kunshan, etc., will be sent to the factory. The factory will initially set up three departments, such as printing, and will gradually expand in the future.

Prosecutors Transferred to Take Office

Yang Li-tang, the chief prosecutor of the Songjiang County District Court, was ordered to be transferred to Wu County District Court, and Xu Shi-xun, the chief prosecutor of the Wu County District Court, was transferred to Songjiang. Chief Xu left office on the 13th and took a car to Songjiang on the morning of the 14th, scheduled to arrive on the 15th. Chief Yang of Songjiang also arrived in Suzhou from his original position on the 14th, ready to take over on the 15th.

### Changshu

Many Detained Opium Addicts Falsely Accused

This county was ordered to conduct a general re-examination of opium addicts, starting from January 1st and ending on February 10th. According to the report, a total of more than 1,200 unlicensed opium addicts were found in the province. However, the arrest procedures were inevitably abused, resulting in innocent civilians with slight illnesses being detained for examination, which is extremely unjust. According to the report of the County Hospital, nearly half of those detained do not smoke opium. From the beginning of the re-examination up until the 11th of this month, a total of 712 opium addicts were examined. Among them, 310 were found to be addicted, 46 were found to have used but were not addicted, and 356 were found to be innocent and wrongly implicated. 151 are still being examined. Based on these statistics, it is sufficient to prove that many innocent civilians were wrongly accused during the process.

### Changzhou

Counterfeiting County Seal for Tax Collection Case

The Menghe River Dredging Committee in the Third District of Wuyi collected funds to dredge the river in 1928, which was completed in 1934. The funds were used to offset the collection of land tax and timber raft tax. The collection was stopped in 1934, but more than 50,000 yuan was owed to the bank, which could not be repaid. The committee had requested the county government to submit a resolution to the political affairs meeting to continue collecting land tax per mu to offset the debt. Just as it was preparing to submit it to the provincial government for approval, the county government received a secret report that the committee was privately collecting timber raft tax. Recently, several receipts for the collection of timber raft tax were seized, and it was discovered that they were stamped with a forged county government seal. County Magistrate Hou Hou-zong considered the case to be of great importance, and often sent police officers to summon Shao Shan-tao, the director of the economic section of the committee, Zhu Yun-shan, the accountant, and Wang Ji-kang, the tax collector, for questioning. The donation books and registers were also submitted to the government for interrogation. As a result, Shao Shan-tao and Wang Ji-lian were released on bail. Zhu Yun-shan is suspected of forging the county seal and was detained first, and a report was immediately submitted to the provincial government for approval.

### Hangzhou

Provincial and County Granaries Continue to be Constructed

The Zhejiang Construction Department, in order to regulate rural finance and handle agricultural product mortgages, had previously designated three districts, Lanxi, Jiaxing, and Linhai, and planned to build sixteen provincial agricultural granaries. Later, Wu Jian-yang was transferred to Hubei, and Wang Zheng succeeded as the head of the Construction Department. Now, after research and consideration, it has been decided to promote it according to the original plan, but the methods and procedures have been slightly changed. A medical preparation office has been established, which is handled by the commissioner's office on its behalf, and subsidies will be provided as appropriate. The construction will be completed by the end of June. The number of granaries to be built this year will be limited to one or two per district for the time being. As for the thirty-three counties building county granaries, seventy-six sites have been surveyed, and seventeen counties have approved budgets. All of them will be completed this year.

All Businesses Achieve Profits

Hangzhou's businesses, due to the bumper harvest of agricultural products last autumn and the increasing convenience of national water and land transportation, have seen a turnaround from the desolate market conditions of previous years. Since the grand finale of business, all industries have made profits. The banking industry is the best, with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, local banks, and farmers' banks. Last year, each money shop had a profit of 10,000 yuan. The sales of silk and cloth were particularly high due to the improved rural economy. It is said that Gaoyi Tai Cloth Shop made a profit of more than 200,000 yuan. The coal industry has been experiencing a shortage of goods and rising prices, and its prosperity has been unseen for many years, with the highest profits among all industries. The rice, paper, and foil industries have also been performing well, with the rice and paper industries surpassing the others.

### Letter

To the Editor: I have read your newspaper's dispatch from Kunshan on the fourteenth regarding the case of relapse and bribery, in which my name is mentioned, which is very shocking. I have never been involved in external affairs. The arrest mentioned in the article is even more fictitious. As it concerns my personal reputation, I am writing this letter to request a correction. Sincerely, Wang Pi-cheng.

### An Examination of the Truth and Theory of the So-Called China People's Front

— Luo Mei-huan

To understand the content of the so-called China People's Front (i.e., the United Front or the Unified Front), it is not enough to interpret it solely from the slogans they shout. It is necessary to get to the bottom of it, find out their masterminds, and then examine their theories to get to the bottom of the matter. Now I will first present some true evidence to vividly reveal their true colors, and then discuss the rest.

The first piece of evidence is the report by Dimitrov, Chairman of the Seventh Congress of the Third International, on the Chinese section:

"The survival of the great Chinese nation has reached a critical juncture. Only the Chinese Soviets are the unified center in the struggle against imperialist enslavement and partition of China; only the Chinese Soviets can unify and unite all anti-imperialist forces to carry out the national liberation struggle of the Chinese people. Therefore, our heroic brothers, the Chinese Communist Party, have proposed to establish a broad anti-imperialist united front... We fully agree with this view of the Chinese Communist Party..." (See "On the United Front" in the report – pages 138-139)

The second is the resolution passed by the Seventh Congress of the Third International on the establishment of the People's Front in China:

"In China, it is necessary to link the expansion of the Soviet movement and the consolidation of the fighting power of the Red Army with the development of the anti-imperialist movement of the people throughout China. This movement should be carried out under the following slogans: arm the people to carry out the national revolutionary struggle, oppose the imperialist robbers, and first of all oppose Japanese imperialism and its running dogs. The Soviets should become the center of the liberation struggle of the people throughout China.") See Resolution No. 54 of the Seventh Congress of the Third International).

The third is the resolution of the Chinese Communist Party on establishing the Chinese People's Front, the content of which is roughly as follows:

1. "Under the guise of resisting Japan, launch a broad People's Front and use it as an outer organization of the Chinese Communist Party.

2. The organization of this front, regardless of who, what faction, what class, or what armed forces, can participate under the name of resisting Japan. However, the working class and peasants are the basic driving force of this organization.

3. The route of this organization is to organize various national salvation groups based on the living conditions of the masses in various places: such as the Workers' National Salvation Association, the Peasants' National Salvation Association, the Merchants' National Salvation Association, the Students' National Salvation Association, the Women's National Salvation Association, the Soldiers' National Salvation Association, the Disaster Victims' National Salvation Association, the Literary National Salvation Association, the National Salvation Reading Association, etc. Under the name of national salvation, launch struggles against the current government. In principle, the organizational method is secret, but under appropriate circumstances, strive for openness.

4. The leadership of this organization is the responsibility of the Communist Party to launch and lead. The means are to manipulate and seize it with the most active attitude, speech, and actions. In particular, the demands of the masses themselves are the prerequisites for mobilizing to resist Japan, in order to consolidate the leadership.

5. The use of this organization: (1) Oppose Japanese imperialism. (2) Oppose the current government and the Chinese Kuomintang. (3) Incite the demands of the masses themselves to hinder the development of the current government's regime before or after the war, and even seize power. (See Communist Bandit Documents)

The fourth is the work program of the People's National Salvation United Association, led by the so-called People's Front, which is roughly as follows:

"1. General Route: Unite the people, implement armed defense of the integrity of Chinese territory, and realize a true democratic regime.

2. Basic Tasks: Launch guerrilla warfare, implement the northward resistance against Japan, support the national defense government and the anti-Japanese allied forces, and overthrow the current government.

3. Basic Strategy: Gather all sectors of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, under the banner of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, to fight for the survival of the Chinese nation.

4. Organizational Work: Organize various national salvation groups based on the living conditions of the masses in various places, such as the Workers' National Salvation Association, the Peasants' National Salvation Association, the Merchants' National Salvation Association, the Students' National Salvation Association, the Young People's National Salvation Association, the Women's Patriotic Association, the Soldiers' Patriotic Association, the Disaster Victims' Patriotic Association, the New Literary National Salvation Association, the National Salvation Reading Association, etc. In principle, it should be secret, but under appropriate circumstances, it should be made as public as possible to cultivate cadre talents and establish strong leading bodies.

5. Propaganda Work: Expose traitor theories, oppose the New Life Movement.

6. Struggle Work: 1. In accordance with national, local, political, economic, small, large, and various problems, coordinate our local organizational strength to launch mass anti-usury, anti-local tyrants, corrupt officials, anti-civil war (but revolutionary inland areas are not included), anti-grain addition and differential, anti-landlord capitalists, and other national salvation and anti-Japanese struggles. 2. Strengthen the masses' will to fight and expand each large and small war. 3. Continuously continue the struggles of the masses.

7. Military Work: Establish various armed organizations, such as the National Liberation Vanguard, the Young People's National Salvation Team, the Peasants' Anti-Japanese Team... Military work must be closely linked to the mass struggle work. Establish a strong military leadership body.

8. Slogans: Chinese people do not fight Chinese people. Organize various national salvation associations. Organize anti-Japanese armed forces to participate in the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. Organize a sound People's National Salvation United Association.

Looking at the above four pieces of evidence, it can be seen without adding a single annotation that their consistent propositions. Although the fourth piece of evidence is the work program of the Communist Party's outermost organization, and the content is somewhat obscured, it ultimately cannot escape its original form when compared with one, two, and three. We therefore know that the Communist Party is the puppet master of the People's Front, and the People's Front is the puppet of the Communist Party. The so-called two into one and one into two is no different at all.

Because the Chinese Communist Party is under the tight pressure of the National Army and is about to be on the verge of extinction, it has to emphasize the use of its People's Front strategy. At the same time, the Chinese people are eager to resist the enemy, and they are easily tempted by its conspiracies. Therefore, the four words "People's Front" have become very fashionable terms. In many publications, they use rigid formulas to promote the so-called theory of the People's Front. Of course, many people have been threatened and bribed, and flogged from behind, so they have no choice. But there are also many people who misunderstand the meaning of the words and think that these people are really saving the country, not knowing their trick of selling wild people's heads, and blindly follow them, shouting united holiness, unknowingly becoming the cat's paw, which is pitiful.

Since the true form of the People's Front has been nakedly exposed above, in order to eliminate heresy, it may be worthwhile to further examine it theoretically (to be continued)

### Shun Kee Defeats Hua Nan to Win the Intermediate Cup Championship

Tense Battle, Shun Kee Wins 2-1 in the First Half; Hua Nan Loses 5-3 After Conceding One Goal in Each Half

Hua Nan and Shun Kee successively eliminated Tai Ping and Jin De in the semi-finals and won the right to the final, which took place yesterday morning at Shen Garden.

### Western League A-Team Game: Chi Nan Loses to Laou Kai Er

Net Loss of Fourteen Goals in Total; C-Team Railway Loses to Tong Wen

Western League Football, after the Sino-Western Intercity teams successively went south, the stadium has been extremely silent for days.

The schedule included one game each for A and C teams. In the A-Team game, Chi Nan and Laou Kai Er competed at Shen Garden. Although Laou Kai Er had just lost to Su Ke Er, it was still a strong team. Chi Nan, except for a few good games at the beginning of the league, has been performing poorly ever since. Furthermore, due to the hard work of traveling back from the south, they were no match for the British army. As a result, they lost to the opposing team by fourteen goals. In the C-Team game, the Railway team also lost to the Tong Wen team by a large margin of six to zero.

### 工商 Football Final Match Report

Jinde and Changgeng Draw - Final Rematch on the 21st

The Shanghai City First Stadium hosted the Industrial and Commercial Football Tournament. This year's competition was divided into four groups based on team spirit, each further split into two subgroups, playing a single round-robin. Ultimately, the winning teams from each subgroup competed for the championship. The winning teams from each subgroup have already been determined, and the finals were held yesterday morning. The details are recorded below:

㊀ Zhaofeng Wins Against Mingxing Group: In the final between Zhaofeng and Mingxing, the first half was evenly matched. Zhaofeng initially took the offensive, with their right winger scoring a goal. Mingxing bravely counterattacked, with their center forward making a solo run straight through the defense to equalize. In the second half, Zhaofeng rallied and scored again, overpowering Mingxing to become the champion of the group.

㊁ Yizhong Wins Against Huanan Group: In the final between Yizhong and Huanan, the strength of both teams was fairly equal. However, Huanan repeatedly failed to score, and their morale slightly decreased. Yizhong scored one goal in each half to claim victory in the group.

㊂ Lianshe Wins Against Shunji Jing Group: In the final between Lianshe and Shunji, Shunji had some of their key players participating in the Intermediate Cup, and they were unable to attend, which affected their performance. Lianshe was therefore able to launch a sustained attack, scoring two goals in the first half. In the second half, Shunji repeatedly counterattacked, but to no avail, ultimately losing to Lianshe by a score of 2-0.

㊃ Jinde and Changgeng Draw in the Shen Group: In the final between Jinde and Changgeng, Jinde's Xu Jingcheng and Xu Buyun were away on a southern expedition, reducing their strength. Changgeng only had ten players on the field, also weakening their team. Despite their best efforts, neither team managed to score. After a twenty-minute extension, the score remained tied. The association has scheduled a rematch for both teams at 10:00 AM on the 11th of this month (Sunday).

### Simple Football Leader's Cup Inter-Port Preliminary: Shanghai Wins Against Hankou by One to Zero

Central Committee Member Chu Minyi Performs the Opening Kick - Shanghai Relies on Costa to Secure the Win

The Leader's Cup Inter-Port Simple Football Tournament, initiated by the Small Football Association, received a silver cup donation from Chairman Chiang and enthusiastic support from Central Committee member Chu Minyi. The Shanghai-Hankou preliminary match was held yesterday in Shanghai. Considering the popular promotion of this event, the association decided not to sell tickets, only setting up seats for spectators. The crowds were therefore very large. In the end, Shanghai scored a goal in the first half to win. The line-ups for both sides are as follows:

At 3:10 PM, Association Director Chu Minyi stepped onto the field to perform the opening kick. Referee Huang Bingxing blew his silver whistle, and the match began. Hankou took the initial offensive, with Xin Zizhi and Huang Guorong advancing together, making the first move. Shanghai's Lu Zhiming and Lei Midi defended effectively. After ten minutes, Shanghai's Shu Shigeng powerfully shot, but it was saved by the Hankou goalkeeper. Deng Zhiyang and Zhu Jingen then penetrated the Shanghai defense, attempting a surprise attack, but were stopped by Costa, who dribbled the ball forward aggressively. Hankou's Jiang Chao and Zheng Zhiyun defended desperately, but committed a foul. Costa took the penalty kick with skill and power. Hankou's Wu Qixiang received but lost the ball, resulting in a goal for Shanghai. In the first half, Shanghai led 1-0. Switching sides for the second half, Hankou vowed to recover their lost ground. The coordination of their forwards improved, and the Hankou players controlled most of the field. Fortunately, Shanghai relied on defenders Lei Midi and Xiao Tang to block and avert the crisis. Subsequently, U Su Ruo and Qian Jingyong coordinated, and a shot went flying, but unfortunately, it was slightly off and went over the crossbar. Hankou's Zhu Jingen provided support, covering all bases. He once passed to Zheng Zhiyun, who passed to Xin Ziliang. Xin attacked with determination. The shot was quick and accurate, scaring the Shanghai team. Huang Guorong and Deng Zhiyang then had a good opportunity, dribbling past Lei Midi and tricking Tang Yinghuan, getting closer to the goal. A turning point seemed possible, but Shanghai preempted the attack, foiling the effort. Before long, the silver whistle sounded, signaling the end of the match, with Shanghai narrowly defeating Hankou 1-0. Observing the battle, the strength of both sides was relatively even, with only a slight difference. Shanghai's victory was largely due to Costa's goal securing the win. It is reported that yesterday's match was a preliminary between a mixed Chinese-Western team against Hankou, and it was not crucial for the Leader's Cup. The important match will be next month, when Hankou will face the Shanghai Chinese team. The competition is expected to be even fiercer than yesterday.

### The Process of Determining the Prices of Newly Compiled Textbooks by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau

On February 9th, a certain newspaper in Nanjing published an article stating that the prices of textbooks compiled by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and printed by the four major bookstores were as high as those self-published by the bookstores, and falsely accused the Ministry of Education officials of being harsh. According to a responsible statement issued by important personnel of the Ministry of Education, "The Ministry has always paid great attention to reducing the prices of textbooks. In the past, the prices of textbooks were indeed too high, so we have repeatedly persuaded bookstores to reduce prices. For example, the price of elementary school textbooks, which was 10 cents per volume five or six years ago, has been reduced to about 6 cents per volume since last year, and the number of pages has increased, which is not comparable to the past. This is an obvious fact. The elementary school textbooks compiled by the Compilation and Translation Bureau are published by Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and World four bookstores. The prices were solemnly discussed and determined by Yang Zhensheng, Hui Zhen, Ma Zongrong, and Gu Shusen, members of the Textbook Editing Committee of the Ministry, together with Lu Pinqin, representative of Zhengzhong, Li Bojia, representative of Commercial Press, Wang Zuliang, representative of Zhonghua, and Lu Gaoyi, representative of World, at a meeting in the Ministry. The initial price for elementary school Chinese and Math Health textbooks was 6 cents per volume, and the price for high school Chinese textbooks was determined accordingly. Only after repeated consultations did the bookstores agree. At that time, the members of the Editorial Committee advocated that the price of elementary school Chinese textbooks should be below 4 cents per volume, and the price of high school Chinese textbooks should be determined accordingly. The representatives of the bookstores insisted that the price of elementary school Chinese textbooks should be 10 cents per volume, and the price of high school textbooks should be increased according to the number of pages. Their reasons were: ㊀ The cost of textbooks is different from other types of books. Expenses such as drawing, writing, fine printing, binding, advertising, and transportation must all be taken into account. ㊁ It is difficult to predict the sales volume of textbooks, so they must be printed and distributed in multiples. Often, only a portion of the textbooks can be sold, and there is a lot of consumption of inventory, which must also be included in the cost. ㊂ The distribution of textbooks is entrusted to the same industry, and a wholesale discount of 60% of the list price must be given. At a price of 6 cents, bookstores actually only receive 3.6 cents. Larger bookstores have more expenses in terms of sales and transportation to other cities and remote areas, which must also be included in the cost. ㊃ Textbooks compiled by the Compilation and Translation Bureau must be revised and reprinted every three years. When reprinting, the version must be changed, and the inventory cannot be sold again, which also results in a lot of consumption. ㊄ In order to hope to continue to compile various textbooks for primary and secondary schools and publish them completely, each bookstore prepares to assist the compilers with manuscript fees of 20,000 yuan per year, shared by the four companies, for a period of five years, and signs a contract for both parties to abide by. Editing costs must also be included. The booksellers also expressed that if the price is too low, they will not be able to print and promote them. The members of the committee felt that their words were not empty words and could not be ignored, so the compromise price was set as above. This is the price determined through absolute public discussion, and it cannot be manipulated by anyone. Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the teaching materials of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau are as high as the textbooks compiled by the bookstores themselves. The prices of teaching materials of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau printed by various bookstores are compared with the prices of textbooks compiled by various bookstores as follows (to be continued)

### A Strike at the Second Factory of Xinyu Textile This Morning

Presented Six Demands to the Factory - Decided to Petition the Party and Government This Morning

The Second Factory of Xinyu Textile Company, a Chinese-owned company located at No. 8 Labourson Road, Shanghai West, employs more than 1,900 male and female workers. Recently, the factory was reorganized and taken over by Chengfu Trust Company, and it is planned to change the internal staff, which caused unrest among the workers. At 6:00 AM yesterday, they launched a joint general strike and put forward six demands. It was decided that representatives would be sent to the party and government organs this morning to petition. The details are as follows:

Joint Strike

The First Factory of Xinyu Textile Company was taken over from Huashang Puyi Company in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic of China. The yarn industry performed well last year, so the factory can still be maintained. Recently, in order to expand its business, the factory reorganized all its business after the accounts of the 25th year were closed, and Chengfu Trust Company took over, and it was decided to start work as usual at 6:00 AM yesterday. More than 1,900 male and female workers in the factory were uneasy because they learned that the factory was reorganized and the staff would be changed. Therefore, after entering the factory at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, all of them went on strike. The factory was deeply afraid of causing disputes and closed the factory gate. The night shift also did not start work because the workers did not enter the factory.

Six Demands

After all the workers went on strike, they put forward six demands: ㊀ The Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Third District is recognized to have the right to represent all workers. ㊁ Restore the Changong. ㊂ You must work four days a week. ㊃ Increase wages by 5%. ㊄ Workers shall not be dismissed without cause. ㊅ The original work must not be reduced. The above conditions were contacted by the worker representatives to Huang Longhua, the director of the personnel department of the factory. As a result, Huang agreed to accept the fifth and sixth conditions, but the workers expressed dissatisfaction, so it was not resolved.

Petition This Morning

All the workers, in view of the fact that the factory did not accept the request, has become a stalemate, so more than ten representatives have been sent out. It was decided that at 10:00 this morning, led by Wang Zuping, director of the Cotton Textile Workers Union of the Third District, they will go to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union and other organs to petition and request assistance to eliminate disputes.

Labor and Management Expressed

The Dagong Society reporter met with the striking workers yesterday. According to the discussion, since the Xinyu factory took over the business, the surplus reached 700,000 to 800,000 yuan due to the improved situation of the yarn industry last year, and the treatment of workers has not been improved. Therefore, the workers have no choice but to strike in order to seek a fair decision. According to the factory's news, all Chinese yarn factories were able to make profits last year, but Xinyu alone lost hundreds of thousands of yuan. This is indeed due to the lack of proper management. Now, in order to seek long-term support, the reorganization is taken over by Chengfu Trust Company. In addition to slight changes in senior staff, workers are not transferred. It is a pity that workers do not investigate the facts and launch a strike. We deeply hope that they will resume work immediately in the spirit of labor-management cooperation to seek the development of industry.

### Various Groups Telegraph Support for the Third Plenary Session

Request Adoption of the National Salvation Movement Declaration for Unity. Unity is Fortunately Becoming a Reality, But Worries Remain Unresolved.

Chinese Cultural Construction Association

The Chinese Cultural Construction Association, on the occasion of the Third Plenary Session opening this morning, sent a telegram expressing its support and requesting that its published Declaration of the National Salvation Movement for Unity be considered for adoption. The original telegram is recorded below. To the Presidium of the Fifth Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang in Nanjing, and for the perusal of all Supervisors and Committee Members: We are pleased to celebrate the opening of your session today. Gathering the nation's talents in one place, determining the country's major plans at a grand meeting, rescuing the nation from the brink of peril, and leading the nation to the path of revival, we express our sincere congratulations. In addition, we represent the cultural circles of the country and extend our warmest support. However, this association believes that unless our country achieves true unity, it will be insufficient to save the nation from peril, achieve survival, and complete the great task of national revival. However, to achieve true unity, it is essential to concentrate the nation's strength under the central leadership. The remaining feudal warlords, the Chinese Communist Party, which is commanded by the Third International, and the traitors who act as accomplices for the enemy, have historically been obstacles to our national unity. This association has convened discussions with people from all walks of life across the country and has issued a Declaration of the National Salvation Movement for Unity. The main purpose of this declaration is to awaken these groups, to make them become a bulwark of the nation, unite as one, and resist foreign aggression. Since its publication, it has deeply resonated with the national sentiment. Tens of thousands of people have signed in support, and newspapers across the country have also commented on it extensively. This demonstrates that this association's proposal has received widespread sympathy from the people of the country, and it can be said to be a reflection of public opinion. In addition to compiling and printing pamphlets and conducting widespread publicity to society, this association respectfully requests that our central government pay close attention to this public opinion, consider adopting it, make decisions, implement national policies, and inform the people. We are also sending by separate mail three hundred copies each of the February issue of the Cultural Construction Monthly, which elaborates on the theory of national salvation through unity, and the aforementioned Declaration of the National Salvation Movement for Unity. We earnestly request that your session forward them to the Secretariat for distribution to all Central Committee members for reference. The telegram is urgently sent with utmost sincerity. Chinese Cultural Construction Association, respectfully submitted.

Security Team Party Branch

The Municipal Security Team Party Affairs Guidance Committee yesterday sent a telegram congratulating the opening of the Third Plenary Session. The original telegram reads as follows: To the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, for the perusal of all members of the Third Plenary Session: We believe that the national situation is difficult, the people's livelihood is strained, unity is fortunately taking shape, but worries remain unresolved. Today, your session opens at this critical juncture, gathering great talents in one place, relieving the times with grand plans, uniting with sincerity, facing the difficulties of the times together, comforting the people's hopes, and saving the country from the raging waves. The future of the Party and the country depends on this. This committee respectfully leads all armed comrades under its command to wholeheartedly support you. We send this telegram to express our congratulations with utmost admiration.

### The Water Problem Committee Submits a Petition to the Executive Yuan to Reclaim Self-Management

To Avoid the 1.8 Million Citizens in the Public Concession Being Exploited by the British Shanghai Waterworks Company

The Water Problem Committee of the Shanghai Public Concession submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan yesterday morning, stating: The petition is submitted to request that the Shanghai Public Concession Waterworks Company be reclaimed for municipal operation to ensure the people's livelihood. Water is a public utility of society and is closely related to the lives of citizens. Therefore, the water company should take serving society and improving public welfare as its duty, which should not be compared with other profit-making enterprises. However, the British Shanghai Waterworks Company in the Shanghai Public Concession manipulates and speculates. For several years, the company has repeatedly raised prices, causing users to feel overwhelmed. However, the company authorities are greedy and insatiable. Recently, under the pretext of being affected by the exchange rate, they secretly requested the approval of the Engineering Bureau to change the water fee from 75% to 80%, brazenly raising the price again. The public organizations in the city are heartbroken by the difficult times and are extremely angry at the company for making huge profits by relying on public utilities. They have repeatedly and urgently appealed for the cancellation, but there has been no acceptance of the request. It is clear that they disregard the public welfare of the society and only extort and exploit the people. We believe that all public utilities of society should be operated by the government, which is the principle of governance in modern countries. Now that 1.8 million citizens in our Public Concession are suffering from this harsh treatment, the government should not sit idly by. Therefore, we especially express the situation and earnestly request that your Yuan consider the difficult times and approve the instruction to the Shanghai Municipal Government to find ways to reclaim self-management to ensure the people's livelihood. We are extremely grateful and respectfully submit the petition.

### International Trade Bureau Announces Flourishing Sales of Guangdong Sugar Last Year

Sales Were Temporarily Stalled Due to the Impact of Smuggling. Fortunately, Effective Elimination Maintained a Good Situation.

According to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, sugar is a daily necessity and is consumed in large quantities. Imports of foreign sugar reach tens of millions of yuan every year. Since last year, due to the transportation, smuggling, and tax evasion by the vagrant foreigners of neighboring countries, domestic sugar has been encroached upon. Fortunately, the situation has been effectively eliminated, and the situation has stabilized. Therefore, the business conditions of sugar merchants are still good. The situation of the past year is recorded below:

Tangdong Sugar Sales Extremely Strong

The products of Guangdong Province's domestic sugar factories use the Five Rams trademark for marketing in the market, which has seen considerable development. Since the establishment of the Shitou and Xinzhe sugar factories in the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic, factories in Huizhou, Shunde, Dongguan, and Jieyang have been established one after another. Therefore, the output has increased sharply, but the raw materials are limited. Some factories use Dutch raw materials for manufacturing. The products of Guangdong sugar factories are mainly 24 coarse white sand, followed by 20 medium white sand, and 2 and 4 fine white sand made from coarse sand. However, 20 medium white sand is difficult to sell due to its color and inferior body. However, 24 coarse white sand has a very wide sales channel and can be compared with Dutch goods. Guangdong sugar factory products have a package sales contract with Shanghai Xinghua Company. Except for Guangdong and Guangxi, all are managed by the company. Xinghua Company then transfers the sales to Shanghai Sugar Co., Ltd. for bidding. Bidding is held three times a week, at 3:00 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The pricing is based on the standard of the public association's quotation. The board of directors, Xinghua Bank, and representatives of the Guangdong Provincial State-Owned Property Department deliberate and determine the price, and the opening amount is determined according to the prosperity of the transaction. Its rise and fall also depend on the changes in the foreign sugar market. Sales reached more than 300,000 bags last year. The market price of coarse white sand opened at 22.50, the highest was 22.60, the lowest was 21.40, and the closing price was 21.50. Medium sand opened at 21.50, the highest was 21.60, the lowest was 19.00, and the closing price was 19.30. No. 2 fine white opened at 21.30, the highest was 21.50, the lowest was 20.60, and the closing price was 20.0.

Dutch Sugar Initially Weak, Then Strong

Foreign sugar imported into our country is dominated by the Netherlands. The raw materials for the products of Taikoo Sugar in Hong Kong are also supplied by Java. Therefore, the rise and fall of the Dutch sugar market has a significant impact on our country's market and can be called the hub of the Far East. The course of the past year was initially weak and then strong. The opening price of 24 coarse white sand was 22.50, the highest was 22.70, the lowest was 21.50, and the year-end closing price was 21.60. No. 9 red sand opened at 16.50, the highest was 16.60, the lowest was 15.70, and the year-end closing price was 16.10. No. 8 red sand opened at 16.30, the highest was 16.50, the lowest was 15.60, and the year-end closing price was 16.00.

The Rise and Fall of Taikoo and Japanese Sugar

The transaction of Taikoo Sugar was very weak in the spring of last year. Only a few hundred bags shipped from Tianjin were sold. In May, due to the lack of supply of Japanese sugar, the company turned to Taikoo for purchases, reaching several thousand bags. Subsequently, there were continuous increases. The opening price of Taikoo B mark beet sugar was 22.70, the highest was 22.85, the lowest was 21.30, and the year-end closing price was 21.65. The opening price of H mark beet sugar was 22.00, the highest was 22.10, the lowest was 21.10, and the year-end closing price was 21.25. The transaction of Japanese beet sugar was strong in the spring, and the total transaction volume reached 45,000 bags. In mid-April, the price of Dutch sugar fell by more than 2 jiao. In early May, smuggling was rampant, and the products of Japanese sugar factories were sold at good prices to North China, but they refused to purchase from Shanghai firms. At the same time, in order to firmly resist the sale of smuggled goods, sugar firms in this city switched to Dutch, Taikoo, and Guangdong sugar as substitutes for Japanese products, so their business also became quiet. Last year, the opening price of Taiwanese beet white sugar was 22.40, the highest was 21.55, the lowest was 21.20, and the closing price was 21.21.65. The opening price of Meiji beet white sugar was 22.35, the highest was 21.45, the lowest was 21.20, and the closing price was 21.65.

### All Circles in Shanxi Prepare to Build Bronze Statue, Telegram Kong Not to Decline Again

Creating Welfare for the People of His Hometown, the People of Shanxi Are Grateful. Preparing to Build a Bronze Statue to Praise Merit and Repay Virtue, a Slight Token.

Shenshi News Agency reports that all circles in Shanxi Province believe that Vice President Kong has been running around for the revolution in his early years and is suitable for serving the Party and the country. Recently, he has also provided disaster relief to the bandits in Shanxi and Suiyuan, allocated funds for bandit suppression, and promoted education and donated repairs to highways, which has made the people of Shanxi grateful. Therefore, they have launched a committee to prepare for the construction of a bronze statue of Minister Kong Gongyong as a permanent memorial to show their gratitude. After Vice President Kong learned of the news, he immediately sent a telegram to decline politely and hoped to cancel the original proposal. It is now learned that Taiyuan received the telegram and sent another telegram yesterday, stating that Vice President Kong's creation of welfare for his hometown has long been appreciated by the people of Shanxi and the country. The launch of the preparation for the construction of a bronze statue is also to show a slight token of praising merit and repaying virtue, and they hope that he will not decline again. The telegram is recorded below: "Minister Kong, We received the telegram transferred by Mr. Zhongzhi, which has increased the sincere love and support of the people of Shanxi. Your achievements are outstanding, you are loyal to the Party and the country, and you have created welfare for your hometown, which has long been appreciated by the people of Shanxi and the country. The launch of the preparation for the construction of a bronze statue by the people of Shanxi is also to show a slight token of praising merit and repaying virtue. The initiators have not met you in person, but they are striving to promote it in order to admire contemporary sages and adhere to public opinion, with the goal of achieving the bronze statue as soon as possible. We received your telegram humbly declining, which is not what the people of Shanxi are willing to hear. We hope that you will not decline again. The committee was established on the 7th, and all plans are in progress. The details are entrusted to Mr. Zhongzhi for transfer. The Committee for Preparing to Build a Bronze Statue of Minister Kong Gongyong of the People of Shanxi, respectfully submitted.

### Bankers Discuss Rapid Progress in Banking Industry

Business Transferred, Focus on Production, Rural Investment. Solid Foundation Helps National Economic Development.

My country's banking business has made rapid progress in recent years, and the overall financial situation has become more stable due to the efforts of the banking industry and the maintenance of government policies. The improvement in the year-end summary of various industries in the 25th year is clear evidence of this. A Xin Xin She reporter specifically interviewed a giant banker to inquire about the recent trends in the business of various banks. According to the discussion, the trends in the business of various banks are closely related to the economy and industry of various provinces and cities. The Central China Communications Bank is my country's national bank, and its business scope is still moving forward in accordance with the government's designated policies, with no difference. The consistent stability of foreign exchange over the past year shows the strength of the three banks in maintaining finance. The purpose of the Farmers Bank is to serve rural areas, so the number of rural warehouses established in various places in recent years is considerable. Although there are no exact figures for the number of loans lent to rural areas through cooperation and transfer in various counties and townships, the gradual increase in cooperatives in various places indicates that lending has become widespread. The purpose of local banks in various provinces is to complete the financial network of the whole province and handle cooperative credit unions. Business progress is good. Other commercial banks focus on businesses such as mortgages, remittances, and trading bonds, but each bank has deeply felt the necessity of investing in production and construction and rural areas in recent years. They no longer focus exclusively on cities as they did in the past. For example, in the previous year, the important loans of various banks belonged to economic construction, such as road construction, telecommunications, silk cocoons, fisheries, and agricultural warehouses and transportation, totaling more than 100 million yuan, which shows that the business policies of various banks are becoming more stable. In short, as a result of the transfer of banking business, not only is the foundation of the banking industry itself solid, but it also greatly contributes to the development of the national economy.

He Shangping of the All-Economic Council's Sericulture Improvement Committee, Miao Zhongxiu of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Xue Shouquan, a giant of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, were invited by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction to go to Guangdong to inspect the sericulture industry in order to seek improvement. He and his party returned to Shanghai on the French postal ship Yi Li Dong some days ago. According to Miao Zhongxiu, who spoke to reporters, he felt that the climate of Guangdong Province was warm and suitable for sericulture during this investigation, and that the sericulture areas in Guangdong Province were concentrated, unlike the dispersion in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which increased a lot of convenience in management. The report of this trip and future development directions are currently being drafted by Mr. He Shangping. Due to the urgency of time, I was unable to go to Guangxi.

### Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau Establishes Shipping Route Investigation Committee

Implementing the Ministry of Communications' Supervision Regulations to Prevent Arbitrary Competition Among Vessels

The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau previously received an order from the Ministry of Communications to promulgate the Shipping Industry Supervision Regulations. The bureau has organized a Shipping Route Investigation Committee to supervise and control the allocation of shipping routes and cargo transport for shipping companies, as well as the balancing of tonnage. It will also strictly prohibit arbitrary competition among shipping bureaus. A reporter from the *Shen Shi Daily* has investigated and reported the details as follows:

### Huang Jiaqiu Discusses the Future of China's Shipping Industry

Recently, the shipping industry has been very prosperous, and freight rates have been rising steadily. To understand the reasons for this, a reporter visited Mr. Huang Jiaqiu, Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association and Manager of the Antong Shipping Company. According to Mr. Huang, the main reason for the recent rapid increase in ship rentals and freight rates, with charter rates rising to three yuan and three jiao per deadweight ton, is that after the naval conference failed to produce good results, all countries are making every effort to expand their naval military preparations. This has led to an invisible stagnation in the manufacture of commercial vessels, causing commercial ship prices to rise, followed by ship rentals and freight rates. The charter rate per deadweight ton has risen to about five shillings in English currency, equivalent to about four yuan in national currency. Japan is the leading country in the Far East in terms of shipping development, but even with its own commercial vessels, it is not enough, and it leases many European and American ships. Even our country's larger tonnage ships are mostly leased by Japan. Most of these ship leasing contracts will expire successively before June of this year. All European and American ships will not be renewed to Japan after the expiry date due to high European and American charter rates. As a result, there will inevitably be a shortage of tonnage in the Far East. This is the main reason for the recent surge in ship rentals and freight rates. As for the goods in various ports of our country, the circulation has increased compared to previous years due to the bumper harvests of agricultural products last year. At the same time, the strikes of American sailors have forced many ships to stop sailing, further reducing tonnage, which has also had a considerable impact on the improvement of the ship market. Moreover, the current market boom seems to be of a lasting nature and will not decline until the naval expansion plans of various countries are completed. This is a good opportunity for China's shipping industry to catch up. Subsequently, Huang was asked about the reasons why China's shipping industry has failed to progress. Huang stated that there are two obstacles to the stagnation of China's shipping industry in its infancy: one is the failure of cooperation among colleagues in the shipping industry, and the other is the failure of the financial community to understand the shipping situation and the indiscriminate investment of funds in the shipping industry. Regarding the issue of cooperation in the first point, it is nothing more than cooperation between production and consumption. Due to the different environments of each shipping company, the different quality of ships, the different costs, and the different routes, it is bound to lead to differences of opinion and obstacles if one tries to force them to cooperate. In addition, before shipping rights have been recovered, it is inevitable that they will be undermined by foreign ships, which is not yet the time to proceed. However, cooperation in consumption is simple and easy. A few colleagues once planned to initiate joint procurement of materials, but the effect of a small number of cooperations was not significant. It is urgent to unite all colleagues and establish a joint procurement office with the nature of consumer cooperation. All kinds of materials needed by the shipping industry can be purchased by themselves, without having to go through intermediaries. This can avoid the profiteering of intermediaries, and bulk purchases will be cheaper than separate purchases. Therefore, if the purchase of materials by colleagues is handled by the cooperative, it will be cheaper than the current price of each company's own purchase. This is the economic benefit of consumer cooperation. Moreover, there are quite a few shipping companies in Shanghai, and there are many employees. It is inevitable that a very small number of unscrupulous elements will be mixed in, taking advantage of material procurement to engage in private fraud. If the procurement is handled by the cooperative, it can prevent them from taking advantage of it. This is the benefit of consumer cooperation in improving commercial ethics. As for the funding issue of the procurement office, there is no difficulty. According to the investigation, the total net tonnage of all ships of all shipping companies in Shanghai is about 200,000 tons. If each ton only needs to invest one yuan in national currency, that is 200,000 yuan, which is very easy. This plan is under consideration and a draft will be prepared in the shortest possible time and submitted to the executive committee of the Shipping Industry Association for discussion, and hopefully it will be realized. If the above plan can be implemented, it will have good results and will be sufficient to prove that cooperative businesses can obtain benefits. At the same time, it can also enable colleagues in the shipping industry to establish confidence that cooperation can obtain benefits, and the production cooperation that is now considered complicated will be solved easily. Regarding the point that the financial community in the first point has failed to comply with the use of funds in the shipping industry, it is actually because most people in the general financial community believe that ships sailing in the ocean are more dangerous than other industries, so they are very wary of lending to the shipping industry. But in fact, every ship must have insurance to protect it, and there is absolutely no danger. Moreover, tangible substances can be damaged by accidents at any time, and all industries are like this. Therefore, as long as the lending procedures are complete, it can be done in the same way as lending to other industries. Colleagues in the shipping industry should explain and eliminate prejudices to the financial community as much as possible, so that the financial and shipping industries can reach a stage of close cooperation with each other. Then, the development of our country's shipping industry and the recovery of shipping rights can be expected.

### Abolition of the Contracting System and Labor Dispute at the Public Welfare Cotton Mill

More Than 300 Workers, Including Foremen, Dismissed; Workers Demand Six Months' Severance Pay. The Public Welfare Cotton Mill (Jardine Matheson) on Roberts Road, West Shanghai, has more than 3,000 male and female workers. The factory announced yesterday that it would abolish the contracting system with immediate effect and dismiss seven foremen, including Dong Lianfa and Fu Zhen, and dismiss more than 300 workers from the fine yarn, coarse yarn, and bobbin departments. The workers expressed their opposition and negotiated with the factory, demanding six months' severance pay. The factory only agreed to give child laborers 4 yuan in severance pay per person and one month for each worker, which led to no results. Therefore, after discussion at a meeting, all the workers elected representatives to petition the party and government agencies today, demanding payment of six months' severance pay and replacement of engineer Qin Deming, otherwise, all workers would be restored to work. The factory has ordered to start work today after being suspended at the end of the lunar year.

### Yang Ruisheng Recounts His Kidnapping and Concealment Experience

Kidnappers Held Knives and Threatened to Cut Off Ears as Intimidation; Six Male and Female Bandits Interrogated to Obtain Confessions, Awaiting Further Trial

Yang Ruisheng, the owner of the Yang Rui Construction Factory, was kidnapped by armed bandits at 6:50 PM on the 9th of last month at the entrance of Lane 15, No. 332 Seymour Road. He was forced into a car and disappeared without a trace. A letter was sent to Yang's family demanding a ransom of 60,000 yuan. Yang's family reported the information to the police and requested an investigation. However, after Yang was kidnapped, he was hidden by the bandit gang in Dujia Caofang, which belongs to Nanhui County in Pudong. Due to a leak, the Nanhui County authorities cracked the case on the spot.

Kidnappers Arrested

Six people from Pudong, Lu Yongfa, Diao Hailin, Fei Wangshi, Wang Changsheng, Hua Muyan, and Diao Mulin, were arrested. A pistol, six bullets, and the rescued hostage Yang Ruisheng were seized and taken to the Nanhui County Government. The Shanghai Public and Concession Police were notified and dispatched Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, detectives Liu Shaokui, Zhu Shuling, Song Bingzheng, Feng Zhiming, etc., to take the six people, including Lu Mufa, and the hostage back to the police station and send them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, this case was handled by Judge Huang Risheng.

Appearing in Criminal Court No. 8

Following the interrogation, police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 347 of the Criminal Law for the crime of demanding ransom. He also stated that the Nanhui County Government had not yet transferred the seized pistol and bullets to the police station, making it impossible for the police to investigate whether the suspects had committed other crimes within the concession. The police felt regretful about this. Lawyer Li also described the details of the case, stating that at 5:30 PM on January 9, three people suddenly went to the Yunfei Automobile Company on Avenue Edward VII and requested a car

To Go to Longhua

So the driver Wu Jinhai drove car No. 12292 with a concession license to go there. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at Xiaomu Bridge, two more people came and tied up the driver Wu Jinhai and drove him away. One bandit drove the car to a lime kiln, hired a boat to Liuzao in Pudong, and then moved to Dujia Caofang. The ransom was reduced from 60,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Because the police received a report from the driver, they were investigating. Later, the Nanhui County district branch notified that the kidnappers had been cracked

And the Hostage had also been Rescued

So he sent detectives to bring back the defendants. It was found that Yang Ruisheng had been kidnapped once in 1927 and was ransomed for 17,000 yuan, etc. Then, according to the hostage Yang Ruisheng, he was 63 years old, from Pudong, who ran a construction factory and lived on Seymour Road. At 6:30 PM on January 9, I was kidnapped into a car at the entrance of the lane, and my eyes were covered with a cloth bag. I drove straight to the Rizhao Port in the French Concession to board the ship,

After Two Nights

I went ashore and was imprisoned in Diao Hailin's house. Diao Hailin and Lu Mufa threatened me to demand a ransom of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. At that time, Diao was afraid that I would shout, so he stuffed cotton into my mouth. Lu also held a knife and pretended to cut off my ears. After I agreed to pay the money, I begged for forgiveness and was spared. Until January 20, Diao wanted to go to Shanghai, so Wang Changsheng was the only one to guard me. So I took the opportunity to escape, broke a hole in the wall, stretched my head out, and shouted loudly for help. The guard Wang Changsheng knew about it, went inside and threatened me, and moved me to Fei Wangshi's house to live for one day. At that time, he said to me, "Don't make a sound, this place

All Sides are Thieves

Otherwise, your life will not be guaranteed. Then I was moved to Hua's house, Hua Muyan's house until I was rescued. I have never seen Hua Muyan. Diao Mulin was seen at Diao Hailin's house repairing the wall hole I dug, and he advised me not to make a sound to avoid danger. When I was in Hua's house, Lu Mufa and Wang Changsheng were responsible for guarding me, etc. Lu Mufa confessed that he was responsible for driving the car during the kidnapping and served as a guard for the hostage in Hua's house, but denied holding a knife

To Cut Yang's Ears

Diao Hailin confessed to the kidnapping, but the case was conceived by Shi Erlang and Lao Er who were at large and cooperated with me. At that time, Shi held a pistol, and then hid the hostage in my house for ten days and moved to Fei Wangshi's house, and lived there for one day and one night and moved to Hua Muyan's house. At that time, I pretended to Hua that this person (referring to the hostage)

Came from Shanghai

To temporarily avoid the limelight for only a few days. Fei Wangshi confessed that Yang would live in his house for one night, but he did not know that he was a hostage. Wang Changsheng confessed that Shi Erlang invited him to guard the hostage from the eighth to the seventeenth day. Hua Muyan confessed that Diao Hailin came to talk about it and asked the hostage to live in my house, guarded by Lu and Wang. Diao Mulin confessed that Diao Hailin was my brother and denied participating in the kidnapping case. After Judge Huang checked the confessions, he ordered that the defendants be returned to custody separately for another hearing on a later date.

### Tai Shuangqiu's Engagement

The New Wife is a Female Student from Great China University; Healthy Physique and Demeanor

Tai Shuangqiu, Dean of the School of Education at Great China University, and Ms. Huang Jima, previously divorced in the spring of last year at the office of lawyer Sun Zuji due to disagreements over advocating local products. Although there were discussions about remarriage, they eventually led to separation due to a failure to reconcile their opinions. Huang returned to her mother's home to live, while Tai remained in Shanghai. Over the past six months, there have been many discussions about marriage for him, but none have been successful. It is because Tai initiated the Nianer Movement,

Wearing Short Local Cloth Clothing

He persevered tirelessly. Although he lost his lover, he did not change. This time, the renewal of the marriage must be with a comrade, at least one who does not oppose Tai's claims. This is what Tai considers to be difficult among ordinary educated new-style women. Therefore, he planned to marry an uneducated rural woman as his wife. Later, he was persuaded by a friend, who believed that although such a woman could wear local clothing for a while, once she entered the city and came into contact with prosperous women, she would definitely

Imitate Fashion

Because she has no knowledge, she cannot understand Tai's claims and will inevitably clash with Tai and become unreasonable. It is better to marry an educated woman who fully understands the ideal of the Nianer Movement, or can gradually become a comrade. Tai thought this was reasonable, so he gave up the idea of marrying a rural woman and searched for an object among those who had received secondary or higher education. Over the past six months, many people have introduced him, but no agreement has been reached. It is because Tai

Is Very Filial to His Mother

Whenever someone is introduced, he must introduce her to his old mother. Those who are not approved by his old mother will be rejected by Tai regardless of their character and learning. If his old mother is satisfied, Tai will follow and accept. There was a female student from Anhui Province in the teacher training department of Great China University, Ms. Hu Peizhen, who had an indirect kinship with Tai. She was introduced by a friend and became friends with Tai. Tai's mother saw Ms. Hu

Healthy Physique

Her dignified attitude was considered very satisfactory, and Tai made a lifelong alliance with Hu. Regarding Tai's claim to promote local goods, Ms. Hu is very willing to assist. Ms. Hu's family is a prominent family in southern Anhui, and their relatives have not yet abandoned traditional ideas about marriage rituals. Ms. Hu's father, Mr. Si Xian, once wrote to Tai asking for his opinion on engagement and wedding rituals. Tai advocated simple weddings in the Nianer Movement, and replied in a letter, roughly saying, "...Since the opening of the sea ban,

Rural Economy

It is becoming increasingly bankrupt, and it has recently been affected by the immeasurable air of the world, and the situation is twice as bad as in the past. The whole country is worried about it, and they are rushing to save it. At the central level, there is Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's National Economic Construction Movement, and in society, there is Tai and his comrades' Nianer Movement. Although the content of these two movements is not completely the same, they are all consistent in saving the country through thrift and saving people's livelihoods. Our country

Marriage Etiquette

Customs, which have always been extravagant, often cause bankruptcy in middle- and lower-class families. Those who know it are sick of it, and there are discussions about simple weddings. For example, educators Ren Hongjun and Chen Hengzhe held their wedding by inviting only dozens of people to drink tea and chat, and announced their marital relationship, which was praised by society. The Nianer Movement advocated by Shuangqiu and his friends also has the proposal that "weddings and funerals should be simplified as much as possible, and it is best to donate the banquet fees to the Nianer Society to develop local society

For the Purpose of Production

(See page 38 of the Nianer Movement) The ceremony is the same as that carried out by Ren Chen and others. As for the engagement, only a newspaper announcement or a notice to relatives and friends is required, and there is no form. Although this method and ceremony are extremely simple, the meaning is extremely solemn. It has been widely adopted in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, and will be spread throughout the country. Shuangqiu is one of the founders of this method, and he will surely

Set an Example

Take it as his responsibility to transform society in every move, and he does not want to be a reformer of society who turns into a social disease..." Ms. Hu's father's thinking is very new, and he has always expressed sympathy for the Nianer Movement. He replied with praise. Tai then published a report to his relatives and friends, and planned to choose a date for the wedding. All gifts will not be accepted, but I hope that relatives and friends will change to sending cash and donate it to the Chinese People's Livelihood Education Association and the Nianer Movement Promotion Association for the cost of developing social undertakings, etc.

### Tao Yishan's Car Ran Over a Person and Killed Him

Tao Yishan, the leader of the Shanghai Municipal Citizen Training Office, a native of Nanjing, living at No. 6 Yalbapei Lane, Yalbapei Road, French Concession, took his own car out of his residence at 4:00 PM on the 9th, driven by substitute driver Fu Hongqi (25 years old, from Shanghai, living at No. 7 Quanfu Lane, Chengdu Road). When driving east on Xuehuali Road, No. 8, French Concession, in front of the French Municipal Engineering Office, a man about 30 years old, name unknown, crossed the road from north to south. Because the car could not avoid it, it knocked the man down, causing head injuries. A police officer saw this and sent the injured person to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, and took the driver to the police station for verification. The injured man died due to serious injuries at 5:30 AM the next morning. The police sent the body to the autopsy room and reported to the chief prosecutor of the Second Special Court for verification that day. Because the identity of the deceased could not be found, it was ordered that the Tongren Fuyuantang be responsible for preparing the body for burial and waiting for collection. The defendant was investigated and dealt with by the police department.

### Body Abandoned in Guan Lane, Person Detained

At 7:30 AM yesterday, an unnamed man, about 40 years old, resembling a coolie, was lying in front of the gate of No. A1 Yidel Lane, No. 182 Caishi Street, French Concession, bleeding from the head. The gatekeeper Huang Anxiang (56 years old, from Qingjiang) saw this but did not report it to the police station. He dragged him out of the lane and abandoned him in front of the gate of No. 174, and washed away the blood stains with water. Shortly after the man was dragged out of the lane and abandoned, he died. The police officer of No. 368 saw this and reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate and found a wound on the top of the deceased's head, and it was unclear whether he fell or was beaten. However, because the gatekeeper Huang Anxiang did not report it beforehand and dragged the person out of the lane and abandoned him without authorization, there was suspicion of driving him out unsuccessfully, pushing him down or beating him and causing fatal injuries. Huang was detained and remanded in custody, and the body was sent to the autopsy room, awaiting a report to the court for inspection and investigation today.

### Woman Sentenced for Abusing Child to Death

Sentenced to Twelve Years in Prison

Ji Longcai, 42 years old, a native of Zhenjiang, who lives in the east wing of No. A10 Tong'an Lane, No. 41 Lao Yong'an Street, French Concession, is a cabin attendant on the Taikoo Company's Hubei ship. His wife, Wang, is 39 years old. Because she gave birth to a daughter and not a son, she adopted a boy five years ago and named him Fuxiang, who is now five years old. However, Wang is naturally violent and often abuses the child. Starting from January 8 of this year, the child suddenly suffered from chills and fever, and then developed measles. Wang not only did not seek medical treatment, but also beat the child when he cried, and even used a red-hot branding iron to burn the child's legs, causing them to fester. The illness gradually worsened, and he died at 2:00 PM on the 15th of the same month. Later, Wang planned to buy a coffin and hastily prepared for burial. After the neighbors refused to accept it, they reported it to the French police station, who detained her. The police also sent the body to the autopsy room and reported it to the court for verification, and then sent her to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated her. Wang denied the abuse and hired lawyer Ma Nangeng to defend her. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The case has now been concluded. Yesterday, Judge Sun came to Criminal Court No. 1 and ordered the defendant Ji Wang to be brought to the case. The defendant Ji Wang was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for causing death by injuring people. During the appeal period, she was transferred to the detention center. It is heard that Ji Wang had also abused a child to death before, and now she has committed another crime. It can be said that the net of heaven is vast, and omissions are inevitable. It can be a warning to all vicious and poisonous women.

### Child Burned to Death on Hejian Road and Ningwu Road

Fire Not Guarded Against in the Thatched Shed; Charred and Decomposed, Unbearable to Look At

A fire broke out in a thatched shed without a number plate on Hejian Road and Ningwu Road in East Shanghai at 9:25 PM last night. The fire broke through the roof, and the flames flew high. Later, the Yangshupu Fire Brigade drove a leather belt truck to put out the fire, which was extinguished after a period of time. A total of six thatched sheds were burned down. When the fire was raging, a child (name unknown) was unable to escape and was buried in the fire pit. His head was charred and decomposed, making it unbearable to look at.

### Yesterday's Spring Cold Became More Severe

Since the Spring Festival, the local area has experienced a sudden cold snap. For days, the cold wind has been piercing to the bone, striking the face like a knife.

Last year, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company extended Route 6, southward from Shanghai Jiang University to Liping Road, connecting with the Special District Route 9 public bus, and northward from the Municipal Government to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. Since the extension, residents have praised its convenience. The original operating hours were from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM. The company, considering the sparse passenger volume during early mornings and late evenings, and to avoid unnecessary vehicle operation and fuel consumption, will shorten the operating hours of Route 6 from the 15th of this month. The first bus from Liping Road will now depart at 7:00 AM, and the last bus at 8:00 PM. The first and last buses from the Water and Electricity Plant will depart at 7:30 AM.

### Rejection of Securities Payment to Court

Lawyers Association Holds Meeting for Discussion

Lawyer Chen Zhigao, at the end of last year, acting on behalf of a client, attempted to pay the court with securities recognized by the community but was rejected by the collection and accounting office. He therefore submitted a proposal to the Lawyers Association to negotiate with the court. The association submitted the matter to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee for discussion. In addition to referring the case to the Standing Committee for handling, they sent a letter to the proposing member to discuss the matter further, and also sent a letter to the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange to inquire about the stock prices of companies with recognized securities.

### Township and Village Chiefs' Re-election Carefully Considered by County Government

The Shanghai County Government yesterday ordered the heads of each district to state that the re-election and review of the township and village chiefs in this county have been stipulated separately and on a limited-time basis, and the district heads have been instructed to follow them. This re-election is specifically intended to thoroughly improve the village and increase administrative efficiency, so the selection of personnel is very important. In addition to following the three provisions of Article 2 of the "Measures for the Election and Supplementation of Township and Village Chiefs", attention should be paid to their age, health, and property, and their past performance in handling matters should be examined, such as troop training, literacy education, investigation and reporting of household registration changes, as well as the handling of opium suppression, river dredging, road construction, pest control, and cup manufacturing. This will serve as a standard for retention, and it is not permissible to consider private feelings or allow anyone to manipulate or control the process. The district chiefs' responsibility lies here, and their performance is at stake, so they must proceed with caution and strictly adhere to the previous order to complete the work within the prescribed time limits.

### Uneven Exchange Rates for Legal Tender

Since the start of the Lunar New Year in this city, tobacco and paper shops and small money changers have been taking advantage of the banks and money shops being closed for the Spring Festival holiday. The exchange rates posted on their signs show that one yuan of legal tender can only be exchanged for 280 copper coins, or ten jiao plus 37-38 copper coins for a double hao, and 48 copper coins for a double hao. However, the exchange rate for subsidiary currency is 9 jiao and 9 fen per yuan. Exchange shops near amusement venues are offering even lower rates, sometimes as low as 5-6 copper coins per yuan. This means a loss of as much as 300 cash compared to the exchange rate set by the Ministry of Finance. Today is the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, and after shops and money changers reopen, the exchange rate for legal tender is bound to increase.

### The Grand Occasion of the New Year Family Gathering Co-organized by Seven Groups

The New Year Family Gathering co-organized by seven groups, including the Shanghai Patriotic Goods Transportation Promotion Federation, the Shanghai Women's Patriotic Goods Association, the China Patriotic Goods Production and Sales Association, the Joint Association of Mechanized Patriotic Goods Factories, the Citizens' Patriotic Goods Promotion Association, the Family Renewal Association, and the Healthy Family Publishing House, was held yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM at the Pudong Association Hall, creating a grand occasion. The details are recorded below:

Organizers of the Assembly

The organizers of the assembly who attended yesterday included Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Yanpei, Hu Xiyuan, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Xingyao, Xu Guanqun, Sun Daosheng, Zheng Hairuo, and Xu Jianruo. A thousand guests attended, including those participating by tickets to draw numbers to exchange them with various prizes and souvenirs donated by domestic goods factories. The Sheng Sheng Milk Company even supplied milk at the venue for everyone to drink.

Chairman's Speech

After the ceremony, Chairman Du Yuesheng delivered a speech, stating, in brief: "Today, various groups are holding a New Year Family Gathering. At this time, during the New Year season, we want to make families aware of domestic goods and promote proper entertainment, so we are holding this family gathering. We all have families, parents, siblings, wives, and relatives and friends. Families must have harmony. If people in the family are happy, society will be happy. If families can be happy, they can be united. Chinese people are often described by foreigners as being like loose sand. How can there be harmony if they are like loose sand? Now, Chinese people like to use foreign goods and do not know how to use Chinese goods. Within the family, we must promote the use of domestic goods, so that economic benefits will not flow overseas, and everyone will be happy. Chinese people often do not like proper entertainment. Within the family, we must now implement a new life, promote proper entertainment, and practice a noble and happy life. Then, the family will have harmony. If the family can have harmony, everyone in society will be happy. During the New Year, may all families have harmony and society be happy."

Performances and Entertainment

Following speeches by Huang Yanpei, Wang Xiaolai, Jin Guangmei, Shen Xintian, and others, performances began. Zhang Yinchang's speech on the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory employees' performance of martial arts, the Lin Yin Elementary School Kindergarten's performance, Mo Xuenuo's Twenty-Eight Nations Song, and Lang Yuxiu's singing were particularly exceptional and received much applause. Finally, a Wan Brothers cartoon film was screened, and the event concluded at around 5:00 PM.

### Fiancé Unprogressive, Young Woman Sues for Contract Termination

Xu Sanlang, a 19-year-old woman from No. 13 Juxing Li, Yangjiadu, Pudong, is not unattractive and works at the British American Tobacco Factory. Recently, she filed a lawsuit in the local court to terminate her engagement with her fiancé, Xu Gengsheng. Her reasons stated that her fiancé does not engage in honest work, smokes opium, and gambles. He is capable of all the so-called vices of smoking, drinking, prostitution, and gambling. Furthermore, on August 24, 1935, the defendant and his brother, Xu Zhisheng, were arrested for theft, and a handgun was seized. She does not wish to be the wife of a thief and requests the termination of the engagement. Yesterday, a judge opened the court hearing. The defendant, Xu Gengsheng, who resides at No. 6 Chenjiazhai, Pudong, testified that he does not smoke red pills (heroin) but smokes opium, but he knows it is bad and resolved to quit four years ago. As for being accused of theft, he was implicated by his brother and arrested together. However, he was released on bail without prosecution. He has spent a large sum on his engagement with the plaintiff and does not want to terminate the contract. Xu Huangshi, the plaintiff's mother, testified that her daughter's marriage was arranged when she was young. Now that she has grown up, her personal wishes are firm, and she cannot force her. Moreover, the defendant is lazy and loves to eat, and her daughter has no hope for a lifetime of happiness if she marries him. At this point, the court adjourned the hearing to allow for out-of-court mediation and further questioning.

### Female Servant Missing, Prosecution for Trafficking

Hu Ashi, an 18-year-old woman from Liyang, came to Shanghai to earn a living due to poverty. She registered at the employment agency opened by Chen Hongsheng at the entrance of the Pawnshop Alley on Fangxie Road, Ximen. In September of last year, Chen referred her to Shen Changsheng, a native of Yixing, at No. 97 Zhaojia Road, who introduced her to the home of Hu Shoufu, a native of Liyang, at No. 6 Pawnshop Alley as a servant. Unexpectedly, the servant suddenly disappeared after only one month. Hu Xiao Da, Ashi's uncle, demanded the person from those responsible, but they shirked responsibility, claiming to help search. As a result, they scuffled and were taken into custody by the police and transferred to the local court. The prosecutor indicted them for trafficking. Yesterday, the criminal court questioned Hu Shoufu, who stated that his younger brother, Hu Shoujin, hired her, and he was not involved. The court adjourned the hearing to summon him again.

### Assault on Female Foreman, Principal Culprit Arrested and Sentenced

Wang Gendi, a local woman and female foreman in the fine yarn section of the No. 6 Zhongxin Factory in Yangshupu, was favored by the factory manager, earning a monthly salary of 30 yuan, unlike other female foremen in other sections. Another female foreman, Sanmei, was resentful and wanted thugs to beat her up. After Wang Gendi learned of this, she asked her neighbors, Chen Xueqin and Zhu Daoyou, to protect her along the way every morning when she went to work. On the morning of the 16th of last month, at 5:45 AM, while passing near Qiqihar Road and Beikai'er Road, seven or eight ruffians, each carrying iron bars and axes, brutally beat Wang Gendi and her bodyguards, Chen and Zhu, to the ground, causing serious head injuries. They scattered like beasts. After the Chinese and Western police arrived in response to the alarm, they arrested Shan Huaiqing, a native of Jiangbei, and handed him over to the First Special District Court. He confessed that the ringleader was Gu Zhongnian, a martial artist from the same village. Shan was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and ordered to pay 150 yuan in medical and other expenses. The day before yesterday, Chinese detective Xie Wanfang arrested Gu Zhongnian and sent him to the third criminal court yesterday. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Engineering Bureau, recounted the previous events and requested an investigation. Wang Gendi, Chen Xueqin, and Zhu Daoyou confirmed the facts. When questioned, Gu's testimony was evasive. Judge Zhong Qing sentenced Gu Zhongnian to one year and six months of imprisonment and jointly ordered him to pay 150 yuan in national currency as a warning.

### Thief Caught in Tanziwan Robbery, Handed Over to Police Bureau Yesterday

At around 7:00 PM the night before last, four thieves suddenly entered the home of Long Shun Song at No. 37 Longjiazhai, Tanziwan, Zhabei. One thief carried a handgun, and the other three carried sharp blades. Long's younger brother, Linsheng, and his son, Changsheng, bravely fought the thieves, resulting in Linsheng being shot in the right foot and Changsheng being stabbed in the hand. As a result, the victims captured one thief and sent him to the Tanziwan Police Station, who then transferred him to the Xinzha Branch Bureau, who handed him over to the sixth squad of the Detective Brigade. During interrogation, he confessed that his name was Liu Guobin, 38 years old, from Jiancheng. He admitted to conspiring to commit robbery. However, the thieves who carried the handgun and sharp blades had already escaped without a trace. Therefore, the captured thief, Liu Guobin, was escorted to the Police Bureau yesterday for interrogation. Long Linsheng and Changsheng were immediately sent to Renji Hospital. Their injuries were not life-threatening.

### False Accusation Against Lawyer, Pressure to Investigate Instigator

Lawyer Xuan Zhendong, representing Sheng Sheng Company, sued Zhang Jinrong, a native of Huaicheng at No. 19 Gonghe Road, Zhabei, for owing more than 300 yuan in rent. The High Court's second trial ruled that he could not appeal for a third trial, so the judgment was final and the execution of the debt collection was ordered. Zhang then falsely accused Xuan in the local court of taking 30 yuan from him to settle the case and advise him not to appeal. After the Prosecutor Tang investigated, he found that appeals for a third trial were not allowed for cases below 50 yuan, and how could a debt of 300 yuan be settled with 300 yuan? Therefore, he exposed the false accusation in court and prosecuted Zhang Ronghui for false accusation. The day before yesterday, Judge Miao opened the court hearing. Zhang Jinrong cried in court, saying that he had been deceived by Wu Xiaokai of Hengfeng Road, and asked the court to consider his family of more than ten people and tell the truth. The judge adjourned the hearing to the 16th of this month to summon the instigator for further questioning.

### Italian Father Salqi Comes to China

A foreign embassy report states that Italian Father Salqi has recently come to China. The Italian community in this city is preparing a welcome. At 11:00 AM today, a grand mass will be held at the Sacred Heart Church on Nanxun Road, with Father Salqi preaching in person. Father Salqi is a combat veteran. Because of his bravery in battle, he has been awarded four silver medals. He is currently engaged in overseas Italian church affairs. All overseas Italians know Father Salqi, and they almost unanimously consider him a heroic figure. The Italian General Assembly in this city issued a notice praising Father Salqi, saying that he is a soldier of God, a soldier of the Italian king and emperor, a faithful follower of the Fascist revolution, and a connection between the Italian descendants and the spirit of the Fascist era. During the Great War, he served as the pastor of the world-famous Adidico Church. Because of his extraordinary bravery, he was awarded three silver medals. During the war in Abyssinia, Father Salqi volunteered, and despite having one arm disabled, he remained extraordinarily brave, which is why he was awarded his fourth silver medal. The Italian General Assembly deeply admires this church leader and national hero and has made special arrangements to welcome him. After the mass this morning, it is planned to show two films, "The Life of Don Bosco," at the General Assembly on Thursday night. At 8:30 PM, a public banquet will be held. At 1:30 PM, he will attend a meeting at the General Assembly and give a speech on the recent war in Abyssinia. On Sunday, a second meeting will be held, and he will give a speech on "The Mission of the Italian People".

### Lu Bohong Hosts a Banquet for Cardinal Dougherty

From the 3rd to the 8th of this month, the International Eucharistic Congress was held in Manila. The Roman Catholic Church specially appointed Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia as the chief ritual specialist. After the congress, Dougherty returned to the United States by ship. He passed through this city the day before yesterday. In addition to the mayor's tea reception already reported in this newspaper, it is learned that Lu Bohong, the president of the General Assembly of the Chinese Catholic Action Association, who is an old friend of Dougherty and was also appointed by the Vatican as a member of the special envoy delegation, hosted a banquet for Dougherty at 7:00 PM on the 12th at the auditorium of Zhengxiu Middle School on Guohuo Road to fulfill his duty as a host. Among the guests were Lin Zixiang, a representative of the municipal government, Zhou Yu of the Ministry of Communications' Shanghai office, and over a hundred gentry, including Wang Yiting. Lu Bohong gave a welcoming speech, stating in brief that Shanghai is the largest city in China with a population of 3.5 million and that Cardinal Dougherty's blessing of Shanghai is a blessing of the entire country. He hoped that the next congress would be held in Shanghai and that Dougherty would still preside. Dougherty replied, "I am old, and if I am appointed by the Pope, I will have the opportunity to come to your country again. Twenty years ago, I visited Beiping. At that time, the people of your country seemed to have little knowledge of the American Catholic Church. I told those who asked me that the United States has 25 million Catholics, more than 100 dioceses, 120 bishops, 18 archbishops, 8 grand archbishops, and 4 cardinals. Every year, about 60,000 to 100,000 Protestants return to my church. What I said at that time was all true. I believe that at this time, the people of your country have recognized the position of the American Catholic Church." Finally, Lin Zixiang, the secretary of the municipal government, delivered a speech in English, saying that it was an honor for Dougherty to pass through the city. During this short period of inspection, he should have glimpsed the progress of the new China and hoped that Dougherty would tell the people of the United States what he had seen in this country and hoped for cooperation in cultural and charitable undertakings. The banquet ended at 10:00 PM. It is learned that Dougherty left Shanghai for Japan yesterday to return to the United States.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A

(11)

Someone asks: ㊀ Our company is a department store in Shanghai. We often send out a large number of advertising leaflets for newly arrived goods to the public in Shanghai and other places in order to promote sales. However, it is quite troublesome to hire people to distribute them locally each time. As for the leaflets sent to other places, except for those to old customers whose names and addresses we know and can send directly, we have no way to send the rest because we don't know their names and addresses. I recently read the postage rate table for various types of mail published by the post office, which includes an item for "business leaflets." I wonder if this refers to leaflets similar to those issued by our company, and what are the procedures for sending them? Please explain in detail. ㊁ Every time our company launches new products, we send out printed advertising letters to customers in various places to solicit purchases. Each time, no less than hundreds of letters are sent out. It is very time-consuming and laborious to affix postage stamps to each one. Also, these advertising letters all have reply cards attached for the recipients to reply and purchase. However, if postage stamps are pre-affixed to the reply cards, we are afraid that the recipients may not want to buy the goods and will put the reply cards aside, resulting in a complete loss of the postage stamps. If they are not affixed, it is also unreasonable, as we are soliciting business from the recipients and also making them pay for postage. It is somewhat inappropriate. I wonder if the post office has any simple solutions for the above two matters that can be used to remedy the situation?

Answer: ㊀ The business leaflets accepted and sent by the post office refer to promotional materials issued by various businesses regarding their business, as well as price lists of goods (or so-called price lists) that do not exceed thirty centimeters in weight per copy. These leaflets, whether sent to local or other places, do not need to have the recipient's name and address written on them. The post office can distribute them on their behalf. The methods are as follows: 1. For those sent locally, the leaflets are handed over to the post office in a certain number without envelopes. A fee of five cents is charged for every fifty or fewer leaflets, and the post office will then distribute them to various sectors. 2. For those sent to other places, the leaflets destined for each location are bundled into bundles, wrapped in envelopes, and labeled with the words "Leaflets for distribution by the post office in [location name]". The bundles are then handed over to the local post office for dispatch. In addition to paying five cents for every fifty leaflets, additional postage for printed matter is added and paid at the time of posting. However, it should be noted that the wording printed on each leaflet must be uniform, regardless of whether it is sent locally or to other places. The leaflets cannot be different from each other, and no text may be added in writing.

㊁ For various letters, if one hundred or more pieces are submitted at one time, the post office has a method of adding a blue "Postage Paid" stamp to replace affixing stamps one by one. That is, at the time of submission, the post office first calculates the amount of postage to be paid, and the sender pays the amount in full. The post office issues a receipt in triplicate, exchanges the amount paid by the sender for one or more postage stamps of equal value, affixes them to the binding edge of the first and second copies of the receipt, and cancels them with a date stamp at that time. The first copy is torn off and given to the sender for safekeeping. Then, the letters to be sent are stamped one by one with the "Postage Paid" stamp, without the need to affix additional postage stamps. Since your company sends hundreds of advertising letters each time, you can follow this method to simplify the process.

The Shanghai Post Office has established a method for collecting fees for advertising reply letters. Local businesses that send advertising reply letters can deposit a security deposit of ten yuan with the post office (this amount will be fully refunded when the registration is canceled in the future, provided that no postage is owed) and apply for registration. After registration, reply cards can be made according to the format stipulated by the post office. It is not necessary to pre-affix postage stamps to the advertising letters. If the recipients wish to reply, they only need to hand over the reply cards to the post office in their location for return to Shanghai, and they do not need to pay postage. After receiving the reply cards, the Shanghai Post Office will deliver them to the original sender and record the number of pieces, collecting the postage from the company at the end of each month. Your company's advertising reply cards can be handled in this way. For all the details, please inquire at the Shanghai Post Office.

### The Problem of Tax Exemption on Foreign Rice in Guangdong Province

— Li Yinbei

㊀ Foreword

The fact that Chinese people cannot afford to eat Chinese rice has long been a fundamental and perilous problem. However, Chinese people consistently fail to consider changing their eating habits to Chinese rice. The outcome of the tax issue is even more unimaginable. For example, last year in the Yangtze River basin, a region suitable for rice cultivation, the crops had a bumper harvest due to the favorable natural climate. Unexpectedly, at the end of November last year, the military and political authorities of Guangdong Province, the source of this rice production strategy, jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that taxes on foreign rice entering Guangdong be temporarily waived. This move cannot but arouse our considerable attention. According to the original telegram from the military and political authorities of Guangdong Province, it roughly stated: "Guangdong's summer is cool and autumn is dry, and the signs of famine are becoming apparent. The price of rice is only six or seven catties per yuan, and there is a tendency for it to rise further. There is no surplus grain in the market, and the people's food is worrying. As winter approaches, dangerous situations are emerging one after another. If rice prices are not suppressed, it will be impossible to alleviate the people's hardships. The foreign rice tax was originally intended to prevent dumping and should be flexible. Now that there is a shortage of grain, it can be adjusted as needed. We ask that the foreign rice tax be waived until the early rice harvest is plentiful next year, and then a restoration can be planned. The people of Guangdong will benefit greatly." However, in just a few days, the food industry nationwide vigorously stated the pros and cons of exempting foreign rice from tax in Guangdong to prevent the Guangdong provincial authorities' request. The reason was that all provinces had reported bumper harvests this year, especially Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, which had surplus rice for export. It is appropriate to make up for shortages with surpluses and help each other. Guangdong Province has always taken the overall situation into consideration and should not indulge in its habit of eating foreign rice, disregarding the livelihoods of farmers nationwide and the integrity of customs duties. Even Liu Weichi, Director of the Construction Department of Guangdong Province, argued that, "Although Guangdong Province has reported a poor harvest this year, neighboring provinces have had bumper harvests and can provide relief. Recently, some people have advocated reducing the import tax on foreign rice, allowing sufficient foreign rice to enter the market for adjustment. I still believe that it is more appropriate to transport rice from neighboring provinces to Guangdong." - See the Shen Bao report on December 10, 1936, regarding the conversation with Liu Weichi. As for the Ministry of Finance, after gathering opinions from all parties and studying them, it confirmed that the foreign rice tax was established to protect domestic agricultural production. This year, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces have had bumper harvests and have surplus grain to meet Guangdong's needs. Guangdong Province should purchase as much domestic rice as possible to provide relief for the shortage of grain. The request to exempt the foreign rice tax is "difficult to approve." However, Guangdong's urgent need for rice is like putting out a fire! Therefore, after receiving the Ministry of Finance's "disapproval" reply, it sent another telegram to the central government, making a second request. The Executive Yuan, in order to take into account the people's food supply in Guangdong, allowed 300,000 metric tons (later changed to 1,000,000 market tons) of foreign rice to enter Guangdong on account. The foreign rice tax issue, which had caused a nationwide uproar, can finally be considered resolved. However, we need to understand whether it is appropriate to levy, exempt, or reduce the foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province. The value of the study is quite rich. Therefore, I have written this paper based on my research to provide a reference for those who care about the foreign rice tax issue in Guangdong Province.

㊁ General Situation of Poverty in Guangdong Province and the Status of Foreign Rice in Guangdong

To understand the taxation issue of foreign rice entering Guangdong, we must first understand the status of foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong. To understand the status of foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong. The first step is to know the total amount of rice consumption in Guangdong Province each year. The second step is to know the annual rice production in Guangdong Province and the situation of national rice from neighboring provinces being transported to Guangdong. Only after this can we get a glimpse of the annual surplus or deficit of rice in Guangdong Province. Then, we can find out the status of foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong. If the quantity of foreign rice entering Guangdong accounts for a higher percentage of the rice consumption of the people of Guangdong, then the status of foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong is more important. The more important the status of foreign rice in Guangdong Province, the more necessary it is to consider the burden on the people's food when collecting the foreign rice tax. Conversely, if the status of foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong Province is not very important, then the collection of foreign rice tax can be a problem without concern. Now, please list the general situation of the people's food in Guangdong Province and the status of foreign rice in Guangdong Province separately as follows.

㊀ Estimated Annual Rice Consumption in Guangdong Province The method of estimating grain consumption is usually based on two types: ㊀ Estimating based on the rice consumption of the population by age and gender. ㊁ Estimating based on the production, sales, and supply of rice. The estimation of rice consumption in Guangdong Province is now tentatively calculated using the first method as follows. According to a survey by the Shanghai Shen Bao newspaper in 1933, the population of Guangdong was 33,178,078 people. According to the population survey of thirteen places in six provinces of South China (including Guangdong) by Mr. Qiao Qiming; (Note 1) Infants under the age of five in South China account for 13.5 percent; there are often 4,479,040 infants in Guangdong Province. These infants eat very little rice and should be excluded from the calculation. Children aged five to fourteen are estimated to account for 22.9 percent; there should be 7,597,780 children in Guangdong Province. Adults or adults aged fifteen to forty-nine are estimated to account for 51.3 percent; there should be 37,020,354 adults or adults in Guangdong Province. According to the gender distribution of the Chinese population (Note 2), men account for 52.3 percent; women account for 47.7 percent. According to this gender, there should be 8,901,645 adults or adult men in Guangdong Province. There are 8,148,769 middle-aged or adult women. Next, the elderly over 50 years old and those whose age is unknown are estimated to account for 12.3 percent; there are 4,080,904 elderly and those whose age is unknown in Guangdong Province. According to the food consumption of ordinary Chinese people, it is assumed that children aged five to fourteen eat three "he" of rice per person per day, and one "shi" and nine "sheng" and five "he" of rice per year (each year is calculated as 365 days). Adults or adult men eat seven "he" of rice per person per day, and two "shi" and five "dou" and five "sheng" of rice per year. Middle-aged or adult women, the elderly, and those whose age is unknown have the same food consumption, eating five "he" of rice per person per day, and one "shi" and eight "dou" and two "sheng" and five "he" of rice per year. According to this calculation, all the children in Guangdong Province, 7,597,780 people, should consume 8,319,569 "shi" of rice per year. Adults or adult men, 8,901,645 people, should consume 22,743,703 "shi" of rice per year. Middle-aged or adult women, the elderly, and those whose age is unknown, a total of 12,199,613 people, should consume 22,264,294 "shi" of rice per year. The sum of the three is that the entire Guangdong Province needs a total of 53,327,566 "shi" of rice per year. This is only in terms of the direct consumption of rice by the people of Guangdong. In addition, the amount of rice used as raw materials for winemaking among the people is also considerable. According to the estimate of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, about 82% of the rice in our country is used for human food. The rest is mostly used as raw materials for winemaking. Guangdong may not have as much private brewing as other provinces because of the insufficient production of glutinous rice: But according to our estimate, the rice used for winemaking by the people of Guangdong Province should be at least 10% of the total rice consumption of the entire province. If this is the case, then the people of Guangdong Province still need 5,332,757 "shi" of rice to be indirectly used as raw materials for winemaking. If this number is included in the calculation, the annual rice consumption in Guangdong Province should be 58,660,323 "shi". On average, each person in Guangdong consumes about one "shi" and eight "dou" of rice per year.

㊀ National Rice Supply in Guangdong Province The sources of national rice supply in Guangdong Province can be divided into two categories as follows:

㊀ Rice produced in Guangdong Province: ㊁ The import of surplus rice from neighboring provinces. Now, the self-production and sales situation will be listed separately as follows.

㊀ Rice Produced in Guangdong Province Regarding the quantity of rice produced in Guangdong Province, according to various surveys and estimates, it is approximately as shown in the table below.

From the above figures, although the difference between the survey estimates is very large: But the estimated quantity of rice production in Guangdong Province by all parties is roughly around 100 million "shi". If the rice production estimated by the Statistics Bureau is used as the standard, then Guangdong Province should produce 141,383,000 "dan" of rice per year. Now, based on a 70% rice milling rate, 98,968,100 "dan" of rice is obtained. However, judging from the rice consumption situation in Guangdong, this number seems to be too high. If the rice production in Guangdong Province is really as estimated by the Statistics Bureau, then Guangdong Province is not only self-sufficient in rice, but also a surplus province. Every year, there must be surplus rice transported and sold to other provinces. But in reality, Guangdong's rice production is not only insufficient to meet its own needs, but it also needs to import a large amount of foreign rice every year to meet its needs. Therefore, the rice production estimated by the Statistics Bureau is not only untrue, but also unreliable. This defect is obviously caused by the untruthful figures reported during the survey and filling out the forms. As a result, it is off by a hair, but the difference is a thousand miles. (Note 3) But judging from the geographical environment of Guangdong Province, a relatively reliable figure for rice production can be found. Guangdong Province is located in the southern part of our country, close to Annam and Siam, which are known as the "granaries of the South." Geographically speaking, it is located in the Asian rice production area. And many of the fields in Annam, Siam, and other places are cultivated by overseas Chinese from Guangdong. Therefore, in terms of rice cultivation technology, it is roughly the same as that of Guangdong Province. From this, it can be inferred that the productivity of farmland in Guangdong Province must be equal to that of Annam and Siam. Even if there is a difference, it should be very small. According to the International Statistical Yearbook, the productivity of farmland in Annam is 106 metric tons per hectare, and the productivity of farmland in Siam is 15.9 metric tons per hectare. The average productivity of farmland in these two places is 13.25 metric tons per hectare. According to the calculation of 1 hectare equal to 16.3 "mu", the average productivity of farmland per "mu" should be 0.813 metric tons. Assuming that the productivity per "mu" of farmland in Guangdong Province may be slightly higher than the average productivity per "mu" of farmland in Annam and Siam, and is about 1 metric ton. Then, multiplying this productivity per "mu" by the 49,303,000 "mu" of rice-growing area in Guangdong Province estimated by the Statistics Bureau, Guangdong Province should produce 49,303,000 metric tons of rice per year. According to the 70% milling rate and the conversion of 75 kilograms per "shi" of rice, Guangdong Province produces 46,016,100 "shi" of rice per year. Weighing the estimated rice consumption in Guangdong, the annual shortage of rice is 12,644,223 "shi".

㊁ The Import of Surplus Grain from Neighboring Provinces It is found that the provinces that can supply rice to Guangdong include Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. Guangxi is originally a rice storage area. The transportation and sale of rice from Wuzhou to Guangdong has always been one of Guangxi's major export goods. As for Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, they are also famous sources of rice production. Geographically speaking, they should all have a large amount of surplus grain sold to Guangdong every year. However, due to the constraints of political issues and the lack of economic conditions in these provinces, the surplus rice actually imported into Guangdong has been invisibly restricted! In recent years, after foreign rice entered Guangdong and took the place of domestic rice, the sales market for surplus rice in neighboring provinces has become increasingly narrow. Taking the two years 1932 and 1933, when the quantity of foreign rice entering Guangdong was the largest, in 1932, Guangdong Province imported only 779,308 "dan" of surplus rice from neighboring provinces. In 1933, 3,193,425 "dan" of surplus rice were imported from neighboring provinces. From 1934, although the central government levied a foreign rice tax on foreign rice imports, Guangdong Province, due to political relations, has always been a province with light taxes on foreign rice imports. The import of foreign rice has not been affected in any way. Therefore, the surplus rice from neighboring provinces still has no opportunity to be transported to Guangdong for sale. Therefore, generally speaking, the surplus rice that Guangdong Province imports from neighboring provinces every year is only a decoration in the Guangdong rice market. It is not very important to the entire food of the people of Guangdong.

㊂ The Status of Rice in the Food of the People of Guangdong Province The situation of insufficient self-production and insufficient export of surplus rice from neighboring provinces in Guangdong Province has been described above. The following will discuss the status of foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong Province. It is found that our country has always encouraged the import of foreign rice. Therefore, the import of foreign rice has increased year by year. By 1932, the national import of foreign rice reached 22,486,639 "dan", an increase of nearly 8.5 times compared with the import of foreign rice in the first year of the Republic of China! At this time, the national rice price was greatly threatened. In order to reverse this situation, the Ministry of Finance issued an order on December 16, 1933, stipulating that the import of one "shi" of foreign rice would be worth one gold unit, so as to save the situation of low grain prices hurting farmers. Taking the national import of foreign rice in the first year of the Republic of China as 100 until the implementation of the foreign rice tax in 1933. The general situation of the annual increase in the import of foreign rice can be seen in the table below.

However, the foreign rice imported by Guangdong Province and the foreign rice imported by the whole country have different purposes. Generally speaking, Guangdong Province is close to the foreign rice production area; foreign rice enters Guangdong, and there is no lack of dumping and monopolizing the rice market. Therefore, even if neighboring provinces have a large amount of surplus rice to supply, the import of foreign rice in Guangdong Province is still continuous. As a result, national rice is unable to compete in Guangdong and gradually shrinks; creating an opportunity for foreign rice in Guangdong and for the people of Guangdong to indulge in foreign rice. Taking the two years when the foreign rice tax was collected as an example: The foreign rice imported from Guangdong Province during these two years accounted for more than two-thirds of the national import amount! From this, it can be seen that the power of foreign rice in Guangdong is really not to be underestimated. Looking at the table below, one can see the point.

The average annual import of foreign rice from Guangdong Province in the past two years is about 10 million "shi". It accounts for 17 percent of the total rice consumption in Guangdong. If weighed against the rice shortage in Guangdong Province, it should not be far from the truth. According to this situation, each person in Guangdong consumes about one "dou" of foreign rice out of one "shi" and eight "dou" of rice per year. Furthermore, if we compare the average import volume of foreign rice in Guangdong Province with the rice production in Guangdong Province, and compare it with the average import volume of foreign rice nationwide with the rice production nationwide, the importance of foreign rice import in Guangdong Province is nearly seven times higher than that of the whole country. Looking at the table below, you will be able to understand.

▲The national rice production is based on the agricultural information report of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute; the rice production in 1932 was 969,080,000 "dan"; the rice production in 1933 was 984,190,000 "dan". Now it is calculated according to a 70% milling rate.

▲The rice production in Guangdong Province is based on the estimates in the previous section.

㊂ The Truth about Foreign Rice Consumption in Guangdong

Generally speaking, the consumption of foreign rice is roughly the same as the consumption of foreign goods. The consumption rate of urban residents is higher than that of rural farmers. The urban consumption rate of foreign rice may be even higher than that of general foreign goods. According to rice merchants who are experienced in the field, the foreign rice imported into the trading ports is consumed in the trading ports more than the rice that is transported and distributed to the rural areas in the interior. This is because the urban society has a dense population, and the rice production is small but the demand for rice is large. Therefore, to get a glimpse of the truth about foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong Province, it is not enough to compare its status in the general food; and fully express its importance. It is necessary to further study the consumption situation of foreign rice import ports and other cities; and the general situation of transshipment and distribution to rural areas in the interior. Analysis and comparison can fully show the truth about foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong. Now, let's try to study the quantity of foreign rice imported by the eight ports in Guangdong Province in 1932 and 1933.

Let's start with Guangzhou. According to the city's population of 1,225,830 people, the annual consumption of rice is about 2 million "shi". The quantity of foreign rice unloaded in Guangzhou in 1932 and 1933 was only more than 300,000 "shi", accounting for 15% of the city's rice volume. According to each person in Guangdong consuming one "shi" and eight "dou" of rice per year, each resident of Guangzhou only eats one "dou" and seven "sheng" of foreign rice per year. Compared to the average need of foreign rice for the average person in Guangdong, it seems to be insufficient. If we say that the consumption rate of foreign rice in the city is higher than in the countryside, then this number is even lower. Therefore, from a practical point of view, the foreign rice unloaded in Guangzhou is not only impossible to be transshipped to the interior rural areas, but also insufficient to meet the supply and demand of foreign rice in Guangzhou itself. Therefore, according to the author's speculation, a certain amount of foreign rice must be transported from Kowloon to Guangzhou via the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway before it is sufficient. Secondly, in terms of the seven ports of Kowloon, Yau Tau, Gongbei, Jiangmen, Sanshui, Qiongzhou, and Beihai, although some of the foreign rice unloaded at these ports can be used for internal transportation; according to the process of foreign rice's internal sales and internal transportation, it is generally from large cities to small cities; from small cities to inland towns, villages, and villages. Every time it passes through a distribution center, a certain amount must be retained in this distribution center. According to this situation, if we assume that the Chinese people living in urban societies account for 20% of the total population; then, calculated from Guangdong Province, there should be about 6.6 million people in Guangdong living in urban areas, cities, and towns. Because this group of people in Guangdong live in urban societies, their opportunities to consume foreign rice are closer than those of farmers in Guangdong in rural areas. Therefore, if we calculate from the general consumption of foreign rice by each person in Guangdong at 3 "dou" per year. Then, about 2 million "shi" must be consumed first in the transshipment and sales of foreign rice. But according to the foreign rice needed by urban societies, it is actually higher than that of rural areas: Therefore, the actual number is more than this. Therefore, although these ports have surplus rice to be transported internally. However, the amount that can be actually sold to farmers in Guangdong is definitely not much. Even judging from the food situation of farmers in Guangdong, it can be confirmed that farmers in Guangdong do not need much foreign rice. In addition to rice, farmers in Guangdong also mix yam, sweet potato, and corn with rice. Thrifty farmers in Gaolei, Qiong, and Chao often do this for four or five months of the year. Even wealthier farmers do not often eat dry rice; all year round. They mainly eat rice soup. Poor farmers, let alone, "We see that Mr. Xi Zhong often eats yam instead of rice in his childhood, and cannot often eat dry rice. (Note 4) From this situation, the consumption of rice by farmers in Guangdong is certainly not comparable to that of people in urban societies. The consumption power of foreign rice is naturally not as good as that of urban societies. From this, we can deduce that the status of foreign rice in the food of the people of Guangdong Province, from a general perspective, is more important than that of the whole country. The truth about foreign rice consumption in Guangdong is that the people of Guangdong in urban societies are more important than the farmers in rural societies.

㊃ Conclusion

Today, the key to the foreign rice tax issue in Guangdong Province still lies in the cause and effect of the past indulgence of the people of Guangdong in the use of foreign rice. Therefore, today's problem is that it is certainly wrong to exempt the foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province, and it is also a far cry from solving the immediate problem to think of using national rice to meet the rice shortage in Guangdong Province. We must know that national rice from neighboring provinces must have sufficient supply power from surplus provinces: and a complete and well-equipped transportation network. Although the transportation construction in our country is improving day by day: However, it is still far from the full effectiveness of the transportation industry. Although the Guangdong-Han Railway is now open to traffic, the ability of Hunan rice to fully reach Guangdong is not something that the railway can shoulder. Therefore, the author believes that the food problem of the people of Guangdong Province today must pay attention to the actual situation. It is certainly easy and straightforward for the Guangdong authorities to seek complete relief from the rice shortage by seeking foreign rice. However, in the long run, it is too inconsiderate to consider the outlet of national rice. Under the current situation, we can only supplement foreign rice based on the supply power of national rice from neighboring provinces: and the foreign rice to be supplemented should be based on the rice consumption of the general coolie society. Therefore, regardless of whether the foreign rice tax exemption issue in Guangdong Province has other effects, on its own merits, the current emergency is urgent, and the future outlet of national rice should still be fully considered.

### Guangdong Grain in Extraordinary Times

— Qiu Bincun

㊀ The Importance of Grain in Extraordinary Times

The outbreak of international war is foreshadowed by the following three indicators: ㊀ a sharp increase in unemployment, ㊁ an expansion of military spending, and ㊂ the instigation of public opinion. How do these three aspects appear in the world today? Regarding unemployment, according to statistics from the United States, Germany, Britain, Italy, and France, the number of unemployed has reached over fifteen million. Regarding military spending, according to the League of Nations 1936 Armaments Yearbook, the total global military expenditure in 1935 was $5.4 billion, which is $1.9 billion more than in 1925, an increase of more than one-third, and $3.9 billion more than in 1913 before the war, more than double. As for the world's navies, the combined tonnage of warships already built and under construction in 1935 was 6,013,000 tons, an increase of 552,000 tons compared to 1930. Similarly, the size of the air force and the number of active military personnel are also increasing rapidly. Regarding public opinion, the speeches of dignitaries and celebrities from all corners of the world, and the reports in newspapers and periodicals, all express increasingly heated warnings about war. Combining the above three tense situations, the world is practically on the eve of a second world war.

Since the September 18th Incident, our country has suffered unprecedented national disaster. The four northeastern provinces have been plundered. The ambition of those imperialists has not diminished. Our nation is in an extraordinary time of survival. Can we avoid war? Grain and food occupy an extremely important position in war.

The ancient sages said: "The people are the foundation of the country, and food is the heaven of the people." Napoleon also said: An army can only move if its stomach is full; if the stomach is empty, it cannot be mobilized. During the European War, the restrictions on food in various countries, and the rationing of food to the people, provide us with valuable lessons. Germany's failure was not due to military defeats on the battlefield, but the lack of food was its biggest fatal blow. The lessons of the past are not far off. If our country is to fight for the right to national survival in a future war, self-sufficiency and control of food must not be ignored.

㊁ The General Situation of Grain in Guangdong

According to statistics from the Statistics Bureau, Guangdong has a population of 30,875,755 people. With each person consuming 3.5 dan of grain per year, 77 million dan of grain are needed. According to a survey by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government in the 30th year of the Republic [1941], the area of arable land in Guangdong province is 52,371,000 mu, and the rice production is 148,844,630 dan. Converting it to rice at a rate of 50%, the actual yield is 72.5 million dan. The shortfall is 5 million dan. In fact, the arable land and crops statistics compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics are higher than the actual situation. Therefore, the annual deficit in this province should be more than 5 million dan. According to a survey of the harvest of japonica rice in various counties of this province in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], the total was 107,581,559 dan. Converted to rice at a rate of 60%, the actual yield is over 64.54 million dan. In that year, the shortage was as high as over 13 million dan. The deficit was met by imports from "Annam and Siam, the granaries of the South," and supplements of Xiaoxiang rice.

Our country is founded on agriculture. The ancient saying goes, "Cultivate for three years to have a year's storage, cultivate for nine years to have three years' storage." Since the beginning of modern commerce, our grain has been unable to be self-sufficient, with imports reaching over 100 million yuan annually. Guangdong province is wealthier than the provinces in the Yangtze River basin, and the living standards of the people are higher. The desire for good food is particularly great, with imports of foreign rice reaching over 70 million yuan annually. According to customs reports over the years, foreign rice imports into Guangdong province account for an average of about two-thirds of the total foreign rice imports into the country each year. According to customs statistics, the situation of foreign rice imports into Guangdong province in the most recent ten years is listed below:

The foreign rice import reached a peak of over 16 million dan in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], worth over 71 million yuan. From the 13th to the 23rd years of the Republic [1924-1934], the average annual import of foreign rice was about 10 million dan, worth over 47 million yuan. Before the opening of the Yuehan Railway, domestic rice sold to Guangdong was shipped from Shanghai along the sea route, with Anhui rice being the most prominent. Now that the Yuehan Railway is open, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei are taking the lead due to the speed of land transportation. The situation of domestic rice imports over the past ten years is listed as follows:

According to the statistics in the right table, the average annual sale of domestic rice to Guangdong is about 1.7 million dan, worth over 8.3 million yuan. After the imposition of foreign rice tax in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], sales rose to over 3 million dan, worth over 11 million yuan. The increase in quantity is 80%, and the increase in value is over 30%. In recent years, the method of collecting foreign rice tax has been meticulous, and the sales of domestic rice have continued to increase.

In addition, there are over 600,000 dan of foreign flour and over 300,000 dan of miscellaneous grains imported by ships from various countries. Over 1 million dan of domestic flour and miscellaneous grains are imported from various provinces, which have not been included. The total annual amount of grain brought into the province from overseas and other provinces should be over 13 million dan. This kind of adverse social and economic phenomenon is not only a loophole that can be plugged, but also the national lifeline is controlled by others. In the event of a foreign war and a blockade of the seaports, there is a risk of running out of food. Therefore, how can the aim of sufficient grain in this province be delayed even for a day?

㊂ Passive Regulation of Grain

To ensure the sufficiency of grain in Guangdong province, a temporary solution lies in the passive regulation of grain. In recent years, droughts and floods have occurred frequently in our country. Grain is often in short supply. Only last year did various provinces in our country achieve a bumper harvest of agricultural products, which has been rare for decades. According to reports from statistical agencies, the two main agricultural products, rice and wheat, had bumper harvests last year. For rice alone, the total harvest was 900 million dan, an increase of about 200 million dan compared to the previous year. At 10 yuan per dan, this represents an increase of about 2 billion yuan. The total wheat harvest was 500 million dan, an increase of 150 million dan compared to the previous year. At 7.5 yuan per dan, this represents an increase of about 1.125 billion yuan. The cotton harvest was 15 million dan, an increase of 5 million dan compared to last year. At 40 yuan per dan, this represents an increase of 200 million yuan. The total increase in these three items is 3.325 billion yuan. This kind of increased wealth in our country, that is, this kind of increased grain, is sufficient to adjust the surpluses and deficits of various provinces. If human affairs are properly managed, the surplus provinces will feel that cheap grain hurts farmers, while the deficit provinces will suffer from the abnormal condition of expensive grain hurting the people. The Executive Yuan recently promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Food Regulation," which is intended to allow various provinces in the country to freely communicate in the absence of conflict. The Ministry of Finance has also followed the decision of the Executive Yuan to establish a National Food Transportation and Sales Bureau to take on the mission of balancing surpluses and deficits and managing overall.

### Yarn and Cotton

The Momentum of American Cotton Gradually Weakens

Yesterday, the opening market of American cotton was mixed, with prices rising or falling by one to four points per pound for each month. The price of old cotton gradually showed signs of weakening due to the dumping by spot traders and the continued closing of positions by buyers. However, traders continued to absorb it because of strong cloth sales. New cotton was not given attention, and traders were holding a wait-and-see attitude. Cotton farmers sold short during closing, and the market remained weak. The spot price fell six points per pound, and the futures price fell seven points per pound. The spot price of English cotton remained unchanged, and the futures price fell two or three points. The initial market situation of Indian cotton in the morning was narrow. Later, it strengthened due to hedging by traders and sporadic buying by traders. Pingle rose 1 to 1.5 rupees, Omra rose 0.25 rupees, and Broach rose 0.25 rupees. The telegram is recorded on the left (13th telegram).

According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 15th was Broach at 225 rupees, Omra at 206.5 rupees, and Pingle at 179.5 rupees, all down a few rupees.

Indian Cotton Exports Are Quiet

Although the market was stronger at the beginning of the week because the price was close to that of American cotton, the market sentiment was depressed later due to the surge in arrivals from various villages and the abundance of inventories. Export inquiries were scarce. There were no new transactions with Japan, and only small purchases were made on behalf of Japan. Local factories did not need much, and the mainland was not interested. However, Lancashire paid more attention to high-grade Pingle and Sindh cotton than before. The statistics for the past week are appended below (in thousands of bales):

Spring and Autumn

### An Inharmonious World

— (Yan Chonglou)

One day, on the road, I saw a young woman sitting in a rickshaw. She was wearing gorgeous, colorful clothes, and her face was thickly covered with powder, so her skin looked very white, her cheeks looked very red, and her lips were very bright after being touched up with rouge. Her eyebrows were painted, unnaturally black, and her curly hair was shimmering brightly. She sat proudly in the rickshaw. And the rickshaw puller? He was wearing plain, tattered clothes, his face was sallow, without a trace of blood (probably because of malnutrition). His eyes were sunken, and sweat ran down the wrinkles on his face. He was dragging the rickshaw laboriously on the ground. … Seeing this scene, I thought: If a painter were to depict this rickshaw puller and this young woman in a painting, no matter how much effort and difficulty he put into painting it, his painting would be considered a bad piece of work, because the colors on it are so inharmonious!

This is just a minor phenomenon of disharmony. In this world, you can see many more disharmonious phenomena.

Why is the world an inharmonious world? I can't find the answer to this reason, but I understand that this inharmonious world must be transformed into a harmonious and perfect world.

### Plum Blossoms

— Zhang Zhenxiang

The delicate fragrance of wintersweet flowers wafts from a corner of the courtyard into my breath. I think of the even more lovely red plum blossoms, which will soon herald the arrival of spring. I also think of a seven-character quatrain by Mr. Wang Jingwei: "Beyond the forest, spring mountains break and link again, the water in the thawing pond trickles slowly. At the slanted and sparse fences of farmhouses, a tree of red plum blossoms is exceptionally beautiful." If this poem were seen in Mr. Wang's collection of poems, it would be nothing surprising. But because I was idly flipping through old issues of the National Studies Weekly that I had kept, from the first issue to the nineteenth issue, I don't know how many times I had flipped through them. I had passed over it under my eyes, and several times I hadn't noticed it because it was arranged in the least noticeable place (in the corner of the back page, a supplement to the Republican Daily, September 12th, 12th year of the Republic [1923]). Now, I happened to read it and it truly gave me an "exceptional" sense of appreciation. I'm afraid it was only when Mr. Wang discovered "a tree of red plum blossoms" at "the slanted and sparse fences of farmhouses" that he felt it was "exceptionally beautiful"!

While sitting on the sofa thinking about this, I suddenly heard a radio broadcast, conveying Mr. Wang's impassioned anger, just like his voice in those days. I vaguely saw Mr. Wang gesticulating, moving the heartstrings of every young person. I felt that not a single word he said about saving the nation and ensuring its survival was not a golden rule. I felt even more uncomfortable sitting slouched on the sofa listening to this kind of speech without any vigor. It can be considered another kind of "exceptional" sense of appreciation!

### New Year's Eve Dinner

— Da Mu

Early in the morning, the clerk from the neighboring soy sauce shop came to call me to answer the phone. A sharp female voice said, "Are you Mr. Chen?" "Yes, yes, is that Mrs. Qin?"—My heart jumped, perhaps she was coming to demand the return of that gold ring she lent me, which I often accidentally used when I was in a hurry—so I picked up and asked, "Is there anything I can do for you?" "It's nothing else, I'm inviting you to have New Year's Eve dinner tonight. He bought a Peking duck yesterday. Come, you must come…" New Year's Eve dinner? I stared intently at the calendar next to the soy sauce shop's cash register. It clearly said "February." But I couldn't miss the chance to eat, so I decisively agreed.

She wasn't asking for the gold ring back. I felt relieved. Returning to my own room, I found a card stuck in the crack of the door. It was in Yuan Kewen's handwriting—"Lu Hansheng"—he's been a close friend of mine for many years. We've been apart for years. It's really bad timing, really bad timing. I blamed the second landlord in my heart for not asking him to wait a little longer. Oh! There were also two lines written in pencil on the back of the card. I could only see them clearly by the window: "I recently came to Shanghai from Beijing, intending to raise funds from friends in order to return to Beijing and settle my debts, so as to get through the lunar New Year…" New Year! It stunned me. At this moment, I also felt a kind of appreciation for the second landlord's not letting him stay.

That night, at Mr. Qin's New Year's Eve dinner, it was full of distinguished guests, and many friends gathered like clouds. Smiles floated on everyone's faces, as if they had all encountered some kind of lucky and pleasant thing, such as winning a lottery ticket, gaining a new lover, winning at mahjong, paying off old debts, selling off inventory, etc. I could only accompany them with smiles, accompany them with pleasantries. If I put on a bitter face and sighed, I would not only be letting down everyone present, but also disappointing the host. What's more, it was a New Year's Eve dinner, so I should follow the crowd and chime in with "yuanbao" (gold ingot), "get rich," and join in the excitement.

While eating a water chestnut in my rice bowl, Mrs. Qin said with a smile next to me, "Look, Mr. Chen's yuanbao in his bowl is especially big. Good luck, good luck, you'll definitely get rich." All the guests also echoed her. It almost made my face turn red. Was this a blessing? Or was it sarcasm? As I thought of Mrs. Qin's gold ring, I thought of my friend who came to Shanghai from Beijing to raise funds. I couldn't even finish my meal, and left half a bowl.

"Eating leftovers, eating leftovers, that's good, that's good," Mr. Qin was still drinking with two people who were called "old wine jugs." This was of course another "auspicious saying" he was saying to me. Other than accompanying them with a smile, what could I say in response? I had an unresolved knot in my heart.

### New Year's Money

— Zhu Ying

It was on New Year's Day when I was seven years old. I received four or five dollars in New Year's money. Because at that time I was already wearing new clothes made for me by my mother, I was already eating candy given to me by my father, and I already had a toy given to me by my older brother in my pocket. I already had everything, so this sum, which seemed like a very large amount to me at the time, was unusable. So I discussed it with my third sister, who was two years older than me, and combined our New Year's money to buy a lot of candy, snacks, and toys, and invited the poor children in the neighborhood to have a New Year's party. It seemed that nearly twenty people came to participate. They were all children from working-class families in the neighborhood, without new clothes to wear, without candy to eat, without toys to play with, and naturally, there was no New Year's money to receive. We had fun for most of the day, ate all the candy and snacks, and finally, everyone took back one or two toys.

On New Year's Day when I was eight years old, I received six dollars in New Year's money. My third sister received even more than me, receiving more than seven dollars. At first, we still wanted to have a New Year's party? But my third sister suddenly remembered that at that time, Anhui Province was suffering from a huge flood, and it was said that there were more than 500,000 homeless people, so she suggested donating the New Year's money to the flood victims. This naturally received my immediate agreement. So we asked my oldest brother, who was already earning money, and my second brother, who was studying in middle school, for a few dollars, and combined with all of our money, we made twenty dollars, and asked my father to send it to a certain charity that was receiving donations. The receipt was written with the names of our two siblings, which we considered extremely glorious, so we kept the receipt for six or seven years.

On New Year's Day when I was nine years old, because my hometown suffered from war and disasters, I spent the New Year in a city three hundred miles away, so I didn't receive any New Year's money. On New Year's Day when I was ten years old, I had already returned to my hometown, and received a total of eight dollars. That year, because it was the aftermath of the war, the local area was organizing charitable post-disaster relief work, and urgently needed funds, so I suggested to my third sister that we donate the New Year's money to this. She also agreed. As a result, we two were praised as small philanthropists. The following New Year's Day, my third sister was older, and no one gave her New Year's money anymore, but I still received about eight dollars. At that time, because I couldn't think of a way to use it, I bought some books and read them.

This is how I used the New Year's money I received during my childhood. Although at that time, it was just blind use, but thinking about it now, it was all very meaningful, so I specially introduced it to the children. But now the times are different, so if I were still a child now and had New Year's money to receive, I would probably donate all of it to the aid to Suiyuan organizations.

### Water-Dried Chicken with Feathers

— Fan Xianwei

A scene for every season, that season to eat that kind of dish. For example: eat shad and turtles in spring, eat watermelon and chilled chicken in summer, eat hairy crabs and fat ducks in autumn. As for winter, when the northwest wind howls, what to eat? Large and small families, in this time of ice and frost, aren't they all busy preparing for the New Year holidays, preparing New Year's Eve dinner to feast their guests? I don't need to say: sea cucumber, meat balls, carp, chunks of meat, paired with a large hot pot, plus four cold dishes, this is called "One Umbrella and Four Armies."

In rural households, unless their families are poor and unable to get through the New Year holidays, otherwise, among the four cold dishes, wind-dried chicken is of course like the main dish, it will not be missing. Originally, farming families raised chickens, ducks, and livestock themselves on weekdays. When it came to ancestor worship and holidays, it was easy to catch a few chickens from the chicken coop and kill them, especially during the New Year holidays!

Speaking of wind-dried chicken, there are probably three types: one is defeathered and pickled with salt and peppercorns, which often tastes too salty; one is pickled in the same way for many days and dried in the shade, which often tastes too old. Both are undesirable. Only the water-dried chicken with feathers that I am talking about now has the best taste. The method is to kill the chicken, remove the internal organs, without soaking it in water, and without defeathering it. Then, rub it with a large amount of salt, and place it in a vat with a small bag, pressing it down with stones. It is even better to pickle it with cured meat. After pickling it for more than twenty days (at most a month or so), then take it out, defeather it, wash it, and boil it. Its taste is particularly fresh and tender, with a moderate level of saltiness, far surpassing the other two types of wind-dried chicken! Every winter, middle-class families in my hometown (Shatou, Taicang) eat it this way. Old gluttons across the country, might as well give it a try!

### Feelings After Listening to the Radio on January 28th of the 26th Year of the Republic [1937]

— Tianxu Wosheng

National studies passed down value sitting upright,
Understanding in the heart, secretly pondering.
Sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall are commonplace,
Why should the king of Yue be cautioned with chatter?

After all, our people can be guided,
Strength and health must rely on self-seeking.
Hearing one word, I was concerned,
Elementary schools are just discussing school fundraising.

Odds and Ends

### Talking About Firecrackers During the New Year

— Bailing

Firecrackers awaken the feeling of the New Year. It is indeed more obvious than anything else. Speaking of the New Year, everyone first thinks of the enthusiastic sound of firecrackers.

As for why firecrackers are set off during the New Year, some people say it is to get rid of the old and usher in the new. This meaning can be found in poems such as "The sound of firecrackers gets rid of the old, the sound of firecrackers urges winter to pass," or "The year ends in the sound of firecrackers."

However, a friend who likes archeology told me that it is different from this. He said: In ancient times, segmented bamboo was thrown into the fire to burn. The bamboo segments burst, making crackling sounds, so it was called firecrackers. It was originally used to drive away ghosts. *Yeguan Pian* also says: "On New Year's Day, bamboo is burned in the courtyard." This is the evidence. Door gods and firecrackers both remove inauspicious things. Because everything is asked for good luck in the New Year, the two of them express the meaning of driving away evil.”

As for when door gods were replaced by red couplets, and firecrackers were replaced by gunpowder of potassium nitrate, it is not known since when it began. China's gunpowder was invented very early, so this thing must have appeared not long after.

Indeed, most people who set off firecrackers do not care whether it "turns bad luck into good luck," or whether it gets rid of the old and brings in the new. He is completely for the sake of "playing around." Think about it, once the fuse is lit, it explodes with a loud bang, shaking the universe, and turning the silent air into liveliness. How interesting! How artistic! And there are so many patterns, there are "skyrockets" that go straight to the sky, there are "small firecrackers" in the shape of tofu, and there are beautifully decorated "fancy firecrackers." As for the sounds, there are "double bangs" that echo each other, single bangs like electricity, and continuous crackling like a machine gun's "hundred-son cannons." It can really be seen that the creators' minds are clever, no wonder the players are so absorbed in them!

Firecrackers are usually used for fun. Sometimes they are used to celebrate, like when people get married or celebrate birthdays, they will set off firecrackers. The last time Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned from Xi'an, I don't know how many firecrackers were set off across the country to celebrate. But firecrackers can sometimes show a greater use. This is mentioned in the anecdotes of the revolution: "When the revolutionary army in Wuchang rose up in the Xinhai year, because of the urgency of the situation and the constraints of handling affairs, the people's army did not have sufficient preparations for firearms. When the uprising broke out, because they were reluctant to use the limited number of guns and bullets as much as possible, and they were afraid of being detected by the enemy, several places used firecrackers to boost their morale. Fortunately, the people at that time were all agitated, and the soldiers were afraid of the people's army and hated the Qing court, so the Qing army collapsed at the sound, and the officers had no choice but to escape. Thus, the people's army occupied the city of Wuchang. It can be seen that firecrackers are weapons that encourage courage and intimidate people. They have made considerable contributions to the revolution."

The poets of past dynasties have written many poems about firecrackers, such as Ming Li Chun's: "Pitying myself for my small figure, a spark of sincerity refuses to turn to ash, when the time comes, a cold flame bursts forth, a thunderclap over ten thousand heads!" It can be said to be the best poem, especially the line "a thunderclap over ten thousand heads" is written so majestically, powerfully, as if one can hear the sound.

There is also: "Can make demons' courage collapse, the sound is like tearing silk, the energy is like thunder, one sound shocks the human world, looking at each other, they have turned to ashes!" This poem praises firecrackers for sacrificing themselves to destroy demons, and the meaning is no less than the former.

In this era of self-painted ghosts and monsters playing tricks, I hope that everyone has the spirit of sacrifice of a firecracker!

### Changing Nest Luan Feng (Mythical Bird)

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Ten (A Plain Silk Handkerchief Conveys Profound Affection, a Unique Essay Devises Errors; Facing Yellow Flowers, Autumn News Adds to Sorrow)

Menglan sat in a chair, looking around at the chrysanthemums. She saw on the windowsill a pot of Gejin chrysanthemum and a pot of Yang Guifei Tipsy, swaying in the gentle breeze, seemingly unable to withstand the cold. Because the glass window wouldn't close, the wind blew in, causing the stamens of the "Lazy Combing" chrysanthemum on the desk to flutter. Several strands of her own hair were also dancing in the air, which was quite poetic. This reminded her of a letter from Guoqi that Youmei had brought to school today. So, she first bolted the door, then took out an envelope from her bosom. She pulled out two sheets of letter paper and a folded sycamore leaf. The sycamore leaf was already five or six parts scorched yellow. She fiddled with the sycamore leaf for a while before unfolding the letter paper to read it. One sheet was prose, and the other was a seven-character quatrain written in a flowing, semi-cursive script. The poem was:

The west wind brews evening sorrow all night long,
Moving my thoughts to rest upon my brow.
In this lonely cell, no joyful news can throng,
So I send a leaf of autumn to one who knows.

Menglan read the quatrain back and forth. Although he didn't explicitly mention any resentment in these twenty-eight characters, the seven characters "send a leaf of autumn to one who knows" revealed his thoughts, his environment, and his regrettable situation. Just look at this scorched yellow sycamore leaf – wasn't it intentionally sent? These chrysanthemums are lovely; how could she send him a pot as well? But how could she send it? So, she propped her head with her hand, gazing at the flowers, lost in thought. She sank deeper and deeper into her reverie, eventually becoming blank and unaware of her surroundings.

Chapter Eleven (Words of Comfort Touch the Merciful Mother, Repentance and Filial Piety are Sacrificed; Autumn Light Darkens Verdant Eyebrows, Inspired by the Scene, Thoughts are Written)

The ancients believed that one should be happy in spring and sad in autumn, as the scenery of the four seasons can change one's mood. But that's not entirely true. Those with unfortunate lives may not be happy in spring. And those who enjoy wealth and glory, what is there for them to be sad about in autumn? However, because the Chinese have inherited this inscrutable tradition, happy people are even happier in spring, and sorrowful people are even more sorrowful in autumn. Although Menglan had modern ideas, she had a great love for classical Chinese literature. Within classical literature, she had deeply learned of the sadness of autumn. At this moment of extreme impatience, facing these chrysanthemums, she felt even more unbearable. Leaning against the table, she propped her head with her hand, gazing at the several pots of chrysanthemums, simply lost in thought. (112)

### Border Issues

— Jianping

Chinese people often boast about the "glorious land of China," "five thousand years of ancient culture," "vast territory and abundant resources," and "large population," etc. But leaving aside other things, just taking "vast territory and abundant resources, large population" as an example, we are truly somewhat confused. Isn't that so? "Vast territory," to what extent? Not to mention an ordinary person, even geographers cannot immediately tell us with certainty, especially regarding the border areas that are usually ignored by everyone. No one is clear about which areas are Chinese territory and which are not. The issue of the "nine small islands" in the southwest not long ago caused a great uproar, and even after expert investigation, the results were still unsatisfactory. This shows the seriousness of border issues in our "vast territory and abundant resources" country that is proud of itself.

Now, the people of the deluded interior have heard another thunderbolt. This time, Ms. Gao Yugui, a great chieftain of the southwestern Yi ethnic group, represented the Yi people to petition in Beijing. During her speech at the Sino-Western Broadcasting Station in Shanghai (on the 3rd), her poignant words were truly both laughable and distressing. This complex border issue has been raised to us by the indigenous people of the border themselves. Can we still afford to ignore it perfunctorily? Long ago, someone said that the Chinese people are "a heap of loose sand." However, from this Yi ethnic group's representative's petition to Beijing, we should realize that the situation of "a heap of loose sand" is even more beyond what we can see. We talk about "national unity to save the country" every day, but we neglect the countless border people, letting them live and die on their own, even allowing them to be brutally invaded by imperialists. Isn't this unreasonable? Let's first look at Ms. Gao's very poignant speech!

"Fellow compatriots from all walks of life, our Great Republic of China is formed by the joint union of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, and the southwestern Yi ethnic groups. However, many people only know about the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan five ethnic groups, and do not know that there is also a very large southwestern Yi ethnic group... Because we southwestern Yi ethnic group live in remote border areas, transportation is blocked, conservatism is too strong, and our own culture is extremely backward. We cannot keep pace with other ethnic groups in the country, and instead have become modern primitive humans. This is very distressing for us. Speaking of the population of the southwestern Yi ethnic group, scattered in the border areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Kang provinces, there are no less than 20 million people, occupying vast and fertile land, and possessing extremely rich resources. It can be said to be a virgin land in China that has not been developed for thousands of years... Since the founding of the Republic of China, the country has been plagued by many events, and the government's reach is too short to address everything, allowing them to live and die on their own. The incompetence and corruption of border officials, ethnic discrimination, and the temptation of foreign aggression have gradually isolated us from the interior. Yi and Miao compatriots are suffering more and more under the ravages of natural and man-made disasters, and border unrest is becoming more and more serious. This directly and indirectly causes great problems for national defense. This is the misfortune of the Yi and Miao people themselves, and also the hidden sorrow of the country..."

Indeed, there must be many people who do not know that "there is also a very large southwestern Yi ethnic group," let alone understand these 20 million Yi and Miao compatriots who have been alienated by "ethnic animosity"? As for that "virgin land that has not been developed," there is no need to mention it. The so-called "abundant resources," the resources buried underground, have never been properly handled. However, all of this reflects the seriousness of this border issue – can we sit idly by and watch 20 million Yi and Miao compatriots, as well as countless lands with extremely rich resources, be "invaded and lured away" like this?

The people of our interior can ignore this real problem, but the border compatriots are asking us to "invest and develop." Ms. Gao, as the "great chieftain" herself, is actually the "earth emperor" of the Yi and Miao people. Yet she can "resolve to petition the central government, sacrificing her own dignity and regardless of the long journey" (speaking at Gongdelin on the 3rd). Shouldn't this make us ashamed? Can we continue to ignore the people who have been abandoned by their motherland?

Now, we should awaken from the past psychology of the Han people looking down on the border compatriots. At the very least, we cannot disappoint the enthusiastic representatives who have come from afar. Ms. Gao's indignation is enough to reflect our cold blood. From today onwards, we must not only use facts to prove our enthusiasm for the southwest Yi ethnic group issue, but also expand it to properly resolve all border issues. Reading the newspaper on the 5th, I saw the news of Guo Shun going to Hainan Island to investigate and prepare for investment and development. I suddenly thought this way, believing that there must be even better methods behind it?

### The Death of Pushkin

— Shi

The centenary of Pushkin's death is being warmly commemorated almost everywhere. This talented but ill-fated genius, the great poet of Russia. He died young, and his death can be said to have been caused by his young and beautiful wife. His wife was in love with someone else, and he couldn't bear the gossip and alienation. So, he decided to duel with his rival. In this duel, he was injured, and on this day a hundred years ago, he left his lovely young and beautiful wife and passed away.

Pushkin's duel can indeed be said to have been engineered by Count Benckendorff, the police chief at the time. Because Benckendorff had long been annoyed by Pushkin's revolutionary ideas and was very dissatisfied with Nicholas I's expression of favor towards Pushkin, he subsequently tried even more to frame him.

Benckendorff wrote many anonymous letters to Pushkin, which was also one of his treacherous methods. In the letters, he reported to Pushkin that his wife, who was a star in the aristocratic social circles at the time, was having a relationship with Count d'Anthès. At first, he didn't believe it, but his annoyance increased. On the other hand, the rumor gradually spread, and Pushkin finally couldn't bear it. His wife, on the contrary, advised him that if he was troubled by groundless facts, he might as well move to the countryside and forget about it. But at that time, Pushkin had completely lost his rationality. He could only indulge in wild thoughts, and finally went to duel with Count d'Anthès for the sake of his own reputation.

On January 27, 1837, near the Chernaya Rechka (Black River) on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, was the place where Pushkin and Count d'Anthès dueled with pistols. At the start, Pushkin suffered a fatal wound and fell. At that time, blood filled the snowy ground, dyeing the entire snowy ground red.

When the location of the duel reached Benckendorff's ears, as the person responsible for stopping the duel, he had no choice but to urgently send several police officers to stop it. But the police went in the opposite direction, which was actually Benckendorff's trick.

The injured Pushkin was transported to his residence in St. Petersburg. Nicholas I, knowing of his critical condition, specially sent a messenger to comfort him, saying that he could help with the affairs of his family and other matters, so he didn't need to worry. At that time, he was still thinking about the future of his young and beautiful wife, even while wounded, and he smiled slightly as he listened to Nicholas's message. His bedside was filled with all his works, and his wife and friend Zhukovsky surrounded his sickbed.

Many crowds gathered outside, waiting to hear the report of his condition. After two days and nights, he finally closed his eyes on January 29. The people were grieving from the bottom of their hearts, and agitatedly demanded to know the truth of the duel. At that time, a man jumped out of the crowd. He incited the frenzied masses, and to commemorate Pushkin's death, he wrote a short poem called "Death of the Poet" and distributed it everywhere. As a result, the people's disturbance was even greater, and it seemed that a huge storm could break out at any moment. So, the police arrested this man and exiled him to the Caucasus. This man's name was Lermontov, and four years later, on July 15, 1840, he was killed in a duel with Army Major Martynov over the affair with a young woman named Emilia on Mount Mashuk.

The people's hearts were obscured by sorrow and the passionate gratitude for his works during his lifetime. People of all classes wanted to pay their respects to the poet and made various plans. However, due to government interference, they did not achieve their goals. The government's hatred and suspicion of Pushkin even extended to his tomb. Fearing a popular demonstration, they secretly transported his remains to another location in the middle of the night under heavy guard.

### Mr. Baoxue (Neighborhood School)

— Shizhu

"This is the third time. Be careful! It will be difficult if it doesn't succeed again."

Mr. Shi thought, and his heart trembled slightly. He furrowed his brow again and again, not knowing what to say. Hadn't the previous two neighborhood chiefs been rejected by them because they spoke too strongly? Now he should speak more gently. No, he would definitely look down on soft words even more. In the end: he would use both soft and hard tactics. He tried to calm himself, shaking his leg, putting on a dignified look to show himself as natural and unrestrained. He just felt his heart beating too fast. Finally, he straightened his back and said to the host:

"I... Your humble servant has always taught elementary and classical studies. Now the government is establishing neighborhood units and banning private schools, reorganizing them into neighborhood schools. I think the old gentleman already knows this. Therefore, many neighborhood units in our county have set up schools. This method of the government is really good, and it is really beneficial to us common people! Your humble servant was fortunate enough to graduate from the Neighborhood School Personnel Training Institute in the Fifth Administrative District of Jiangxi Province... The old gentleman must know that that school is very impressive in the provincial capital... Haha... This time, I took a car to the county, and the section chief praised me greatly, saying that I was the best and specially selected me to come to your neighborhood unit to set up a neighborhood school. The section chief's intention is for me to set up a model school here. Therefore, I, haha..." He swallowed a mouthful of phlegm, took out an official document from his bag, and handed it to the neighborhood chief with both hands:

"This is the letter of appointment."

The neighborhood chief put on his glasses and looked at the letter of appointment for a long time, then took off his glasses again, without saying a word. His eyes looked at the chickens outside the door pecking at pig feces.

Seeing that the neighborhood chief did not answer, he was very worried, fearing that he would fail again! He really felt sorry for himself, how could he have been born in this chaotic era, and have to reorganize private schools into what neighborhood schools. He savored the days when he taught private schools, when he was greeted with sedan chairs and horses, how majestic! Now, he had to thicken his face and personally deliver the letter and still be rejected. Comparing the two, Mr. Shi felt a little sad. He scratched his scalp and immediately reminded himself to "be careful," saying with a very confident and ingratiating smile:

"The government is doing a really good job setting up neighborhood schools. Haha, I've come... Haha, what does the old gentleman think...?..."

"Neighborhood school, it doesn't matter if we don't set it up, right?" The neighborhood chief said slowly, looking up at the sky with his eyes closed, and picked up his water pipe to smoke.

"Not setting it up? That, that won't do! The government is determined to eliminate illiteracy and popularize education. The orders are repeated and enforced with great force. Disobeying will definitely be detrimental. Last time, the section chief also said to me: 'If anyone disobeys the order again in the future, they will be severely punished!' Can we not set it up?" He imitated the section chief's imposing manner.

"Want to set it up?" The neighborhood chief's beard twitched, and he clenched his tobacco pipe, saying sternly: "To be honest, can't I do it? I also took the imperial examination in the Qing Dynasty, can't I teach children what 'the cat meows, the dog jumps'?"

The neighborhood chief wanted to grab the business! He lowered his waist and moved closer, saying:

"Of course, who said that the old neighborhood chief can't run this kind of neighborhood school? I'm just afraid that it's a waste of talent, and the old gentleman is unwilling to condescend. However, haha, as you know, the section chief is making fun of us, only those who have been trained can do it. So... However, I will help you submit a request to be appointed as principal. I think the section chief will definitely approve it, because haha, the section chief thinks highly of me."

"That's for sure, I heard that the neighborhood chief can also be the principal, but does the principal have money?"

"Seventy-two yuan for office expenses, which can be misappropriated anyway."

"What about the teacher?"

"One hundred yuan."

"But, you know, now our countryside is in bankruptcy, we don't even have food to eat, how can we scrape together so much money?"

"Neighborhood Chief" He stood up. "Your humble servant is extremely enthusiastic about education. As long as the school can be run successfully, a smaller salary doesn't matter." Mr. Shi didn't hesitate to reduce the price greatly. He understood that if he didn't, he would inevitably end up in a stalemate again.

"Mr. Shi, to be honest, a straightforward person speaks directly. This foolish neighborhood chief will give you eighty yuan a year. You be the teacher, I'll be the principal."

He thought for a moment, and agreed with several "goods" in a row. He felt relieved, and exhaled a long breath. He touched his bald head and patted his long gown, looking at the calligraphy and paintings hanging on the wall.

"What if the children don't come to study?" The neighborhood chief hesitated again.

"To be honest, everyone is just muddling along. You just need to set a date for the start of the school, old gentleman." Mr. Shi spoke the insider's language.

### Splitting Firewood

— Dongguang

Little Wu took an iron axe, still rubbing his eyes with one hand. Hu Qizi, carrying a saw, covered the front of his cotton jacket, and dazedly walked out of the door. To the left of the door, in a small wooden shed, were piled small pieces of split firewood. To the right, larger pieces of wood were scattered haphazardly. Against the wall were several large tree roots, where the snow from a few days ago was still frozen in the shade. After a while, Old Niu also walked out of the door, squinting his eyelids, muttering non-stop:

"That kid, he's really serious about working!" Little Wu sat on a wooden stump, splitting small square pieces with a "kachak-kachak" sound. After the axe blade turned a wooden block over twice, it turned into several smooth small square pieces of wood. After splitting for a while, he spat a thick, viscous spit into his palm.

The cold wind after the snow cleared blew on everyone's face. Old Niu shivered, wiped the thin snot flowing to his lips, put his hands into his sleeves, and listlessly stared at the few pedestrians on the road.

"Sit down and saw, Old Niu, no one's going to flirt with you!" Hu Qizi exhaled hot air on his hands, gripped the saw handle, and slowly gnawed the teeth of the saw into the wood.

"It's so damn cold!" Old Niu sat on the stone brick that he sat on every day, stretching both arms upwards, pulling and pushing back and forth. The saw teeth made a clattering sound in the wood crevice, and sawdust scattered sparsely. Hu Qizi stood on the large wooden plank, bending his waist and laboriously pushing the large saw. No one spoke. The three of them worked hard. Little Wu swung his axe again and again, and in a short time, two willow baskets were full. He carried them and poured them cleanly next to the woodpile with a "huahuala" sound, and then sat down in his original place and continued to split firewood with the axe.

The sun emerged from a patch of gray clouds, and the wind was not as cold as it was when it first dawned. A tram rumbled through the street, and water carts creaked on the sidewalks. Hu Qizi stopped on the large wooden plank, wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve, and somersaulted down. Old Niu put down the saw, and the two of them dragged out two wheelbarrows from the shop. Each cart was already fully loaded with eight straw baskets of fragmented firewood. On the wooden frame of the wheel, there was a large iron plate scale.

Old Niu silently brought out a pile of wheat pancakes from the house. Hu Qizi held a black porcelain bowl of yellow bean sauce, and in his other hand he held a bundle of green onions. They laid the pancakes flat on a long bench, dipped the tender white onion stalks in the sauce, rolled three or four green onions into half a pancake, and held it in both hands like a small horn, sending it into their mouths in large bites. After a series of scattered chewing sounds, they started to drink water with a "slippery" sound.

The guy called Little Wu still split firewood with a "kachak-kachak" sound without looking up. Sometimes he raised his face to wipe away sweat, and when he saw his two partners eating pancakes like they were fighting over them, he smiled and said:

"It's like you haven't eaten in so many generations!"

"You wouldn't say cool things if you weren't running far!"

The two said at the same time, and stepped out of the shop one after the other. Each stood in front of his own cart, put the "shoulder strap" on the handle of the cart on his back, gripped the handle with both hands, leaned his body forward, and the wheels creaked. They rolled forward clumsily on the frozen sidewalk. When they turned out of the street, the two separated, each shouting in his own strange tone:

"Good dry firewood!"

### A Casual Discussion on Zhao Dan

Zhao Dan, a passionate and intelligent artist.

In China's drama and film circles, outstanding talents can be said to be scarce. From Hollywood's new films, we can see Charles Laughton, Fredric March, Colman... many captivating figures. Naturally, the success of these people is by no means accidental; it's definitely not like Shep Fields, who merely uses poses to please women.

There may be a few so-called stars in the Chinese film industry who steal some superficial aspects from foreign films to imitate, but in reality, it's of no use at all. Over the years, the so-called stars have just been these few idols, maintaining this barren film scene, while their abilities are only declining day by day.

Zhao Dan, this young artist who went from the stage to the screen, is only twenty-three years old this year, but his achievements in the film and drama circles are definitely not commensurate with his age.

He appeared before the audience on stage, seemingly starting with the performance of "Nora" in Shanghai. In reality, his engagement in a stage career happened long before that.

The recent performance of "Thunderstorm" by amateur actors left the audience with an indelible impression. From this, one can deeply understand that being an actor is by no means an easy task.

In the objective environment of Chinese film and drama, where everything is weak, everything requires one's own exploration and creation. There is nothing that can help him. At the same time, there is no good environment to give him inspirational inspiration.

China does not have Meyerhold, Reinhardt, Von Sternberg, or Vidor, but it produced Zhao Dan.

Yuan Muzhi's "Street Angel" and the recently completed "Crossroads," directed by Shen Xicen, both starred him.

In "Street Angel," he performed in a unique and original way. The style is completely different from before. From the performance of Qi Hong in "Thunderstorm," we know that Zhao Dan is versatile and capable of playing various roles.

Undoubtedly, the success of "Street Angel" can be guaranteed.

Fei Mu is about to begin filming an artistic drama that uses historical events as a pretext to inspire patriotic thought, with preparations completed.

Li Lili in "Lost Pearl in the Sea," after being wronged by her lover Liu Qiong at the dance hall, rushes out in anger. Disregarding the wind and rain outside the door, she falls straight into a muddy pit. This time, Lili scraped the skin off her knee and drew blood, but because the director was Zhu Shilin, she endured the pain and didn't cry.

Tan Youliu's new work "Mysterious Shanghai" is about to begin filming. The film needs materials from a tour guide company, and he has been testing it on location with the experienced local "Meng" (Junmou) for days, enjoying the process immensely.

In the trenches of "Spring Arrives in the World," the enemy troops are communicating with each other. Their slogan is "People of our own kind don't fight people of our own kind." Occasionally, when a superior arrives on the scene to supervise the battle, they reluctantly fire a few shots into the sky, just to fulfill their responsibility. Once the superior leaves, the enemy and our side gather around a stove, feasting on dog meat. Coupled with Han Langen's humorous interjections, it adds even more color to the scene.

The Miss Upstairs - Chen Yanyan plays Xiao Hong in "Spring Arrives in the World," cramped and uneasy in a cobweb-filled attic. People all call her "The Miss Upstairs."

Liu Qiong has been dressing very nicely lately, making him appear even more handsome. Zhu Shilin often calls him "Young Master Liu."

Li Qing in "Lost Pearl in the Sea," he also plays the role from youth to old age, but his youthful free love was once suppressed by his father. In his old age, he applies the same suppression to his son, but times have changed, and his son cannot accept his suppression. He portrays two different tragedies in these two moments: when he was being suppressed and when he could not suppress others.
