### Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek Issues Important Statement on the Marco Polo Bridge Incident

Only resolute sacrifice can be made at the final critical moment. We only prepare for war, not seek it. We still hope for a peaceful resolution before hope for peace is extinguished, but we must firmly adhere to four minimum stance points.

[Kuling] When Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek spoke for the second time at the Lushan Talk Conference on the 17th, he made a report on the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The record of his speech is as follows: Gentlemen, at a time when China is seeking peace externally and unity internally, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident suddenly occurred. Not only are the people of our country grief-stricken and indignant, but world opinion is also extremely shocked. The outcome of this development is not only a matter of China's survival but also the fate of the world's people. You are all concerned about the national crisis and are naturally particularly concerned about this incident. Now, I will frankly explain to you a few key points regarding this incident:

Striving for National Survival with the Life of the Entire Nation

First, the Chinese nation has always cherished peace. The foreign policy of the National Government has always advocated seeking self-preservation internally and co-existence externally. The declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in February of this year made a clear statement on this. In the past two years, our diplomacy towards Japan has been striving forward in accordance with this principle, hoping to bring all the past chaotic situations outside the norm into the right track of diplomacy, seeking proper solutions. This painstaking effort and the facts are mostly visible to the country. I often feel that if we want to cope with national crises, we must first recognize our country's position. We are a weak country, and we must have a faithful estimate of our country's strength. In order to carry out construction, the country absolutely needs peace. In the past few years, we have maintained peace externally at the cost of making concessions and enduring pain, which is the reason for this. At the Fifth National Congress two years ago, in my foreign policy report, I said, "We will never abandon peace until the time when peace is fundamentally hopeless, and we will never lightly speak of sacrifice until the final critical moment." Following this year's Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee's explanation of the "final critical moment," it fully expressed our love for peace. Since we are a weak country, if we reach the final critical moment, we can only strive for national survival with the lives of the entire nation. At that time, we will no longer be allowed to compromise halfway. It must be known that the conditions for compromise halfway are conditions for complete surrender and complete destruction. The people of the whole country must clearly recognize the meaning of the so-called final critical moment. Once the final critical moment arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end. Only with the determination to "sacrifice to the end" can we win the final victory. If we are hesitant and delusional about temporary peace, we will plunge the nation into an abyss of eternal suffering.

The Marco Polo Bridge Incident Was a Planned Action

Second, after the occurrence of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, some people thought it was a sudden and accidental event. However, the other party's direct and indirect expressions in public opinion or diplomacy in the past month have made us realize the signs of the incident's occurrence. Moreover, before and after the incident, various news were spread, saying that the scope of the Tanggu Truce Agreement should be expanded, the puppet organization in eastern Hebei should be expanded, the 29th Army should be expelled, and Song Zheyuan should be forced to leave. Rumors of this kind are too numerous to mention. It can be imagined that this incident was not accidental. From the course of this incident, we know that people have been scheming to harm us with great deliberation, and peace is not easily attainable. If we want peace and tranquility at present, we can only allow people's troops to enter and leave our territory without restriction, while our own troops must be restricted and cannot be freely stationed within our own territory, or people can shoot at Chinese troops, and we cannot return fire. In other words, we are at the mercy of others. We are about to face this extremely tragic situation in the world. No nation with a little personality in the world can tolerate this. Our Northeast provinces have been lost for six years. Following the Tanggu Truce Agreement, the conflict point has now reached the Marco Polo Bridge at the entrance to Peiping. If the Marco Polo Bridge can be oppressed and forcibly occupied, then Peiping, our five-hundred-year-old ancient capital, the center of northern political culture, and a military stronghold, will become the second Shenyang. If today's Peiping becomes the Shenyang of the past, then today's Hebei and Chahar will also become the four northeastern provinces of the past. If Peiping can become Shenyang, then why can't Nanjing become Peiping? Therefore, the evolution of the Marco Polo Bridge incident is related to the entire Chinese state. Whether this matter can be ended is the realm of the final critical moment.

Giving Up an Inch of Land Makes One a Sinner for All Time

Third, if we truly reach the unavoidable final critical moment, we will naturally only have sacrifice and resistance. But our attitude is only to respond to war, not to seek it. War is a last resort to deal with the final critical moment. The people of the whole country must trust that the government is already in the process of preparing as a whole. Because we are a weak country, and because upholding peace is our national policy, we cannot seek war. We are indeed a weak country, but we cannot fail to maintain the life of our nation, and we cannot fail to shoulder the historical responsibility left to us by our ancestors. Therefore, when it is absolutely necessary, we cannot fail to respond to war. As for after the war has begun, because we are a weak country, there will be no opportunity for compromise. If we give up an inch of land and sovereignty, we will be sinners of the Chinese nation for all time. At that time, we can only strive for our final victory with the lives of the nation.

The Key to Whether Peace Continues Lies Entirely in Japan's Actions

Fourth, whether the Marco Polo Bridge Incident can be prevented from escalating into a Sino-Japanese war depends entirely on the attitude of the Japanese government. The key to whether the hope for peace continues lies entirely in the actions of the Japanese army. One second before peace is fundamentally hopeless, we still hope for peace. We hope to resolve the Marco Polo Bridge Incident through peaceful diplomatic means. However, our position has four very clear points: (1) Any resolution must not infringe on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity; (2) The administrative organization of Hebei and Chahar must not undergo any illegal changes; (3) Local officials appointed by the central government, such as Song Zheyuan, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, etc., cannot be removed at the request of others; (4) The area where the 29th Army is currently stationed cannot be subject to any restrictions. These four points of position are the minimum for the diplomacy of a weak country. If the other party can still put itself in the position of Eastern nations and make a long-term plan, and does not want to push the relationship between the two countries to the final critical moment, and does not want to create eternal hatred between China and Japan, they should not ignore our minimum position. In short, the government has determined a consistent policy and position from beginning to end regarding the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and it will do its best to firmly adhere to this position. We hope for peace but do not seek temporary security, and we prepare for war but never seek war. We know that after the whole country responds to war, there will only be sacrifice to the end, without any possibility of escape. If the war begins, then there will be no distinction between north and south, no distinction between young and old. No matter who it is, everyone has the responsibility to defend the territory and resist the war, and everyone should be determined to sacrifice everything. Therefore, the government must be particularly cautious in dealing with this major event, and the people of the whole country must also be serious, calm, and prepared to defend themselves. At this moment of life and death, we can only rely on the unity of the whole country, obey the rules, and strictly observe order. I hope that everyone will return to their respective places and convey this meaning to the society so that everyone can understand the situation and be loyal to the country. This is what I sincerely hope for. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

### Tianjin Japanese Garrison Declares Direct Action Will Begin This Afternoon

Japanese Troops in Dajing Village Bombard Our Positions; Using as a Pretext that Our Troops Wounded Their Officers; Japanese Intentions Are Sinister, Major War Will Break Out

[Peiping] At 7 PM on the 19th, more than 40 Japanese soldiers from Fengtai, carrying heavy machine guns, reinforced the Tujia shop in Dajing Village. At around 9 PM, Japanese troops in Dajing Village fired three artillery shells at our troops and fired machine guns. We did not return fire. The Japanese troops then stopped firing. (Emergency telegram at 11 PM on the 19th)

[Peiping] After the Japanese troops in Dajing Village fired artillery on the 19th, the Japanese garrison suddenly issued an ultimatum to our side, questioning that our side had fired the artillery.

[Nanjing] While so-called peace negotiations are being conducted in Tianjin, the Japanese side has repeatedly taken expanded military actions, recently reconnoitering the Zhang River in Henan Province, and also bombing the Peiping-Hankou train, showing no sincerity for peace.

Whether the negotiations that have been held for days can achieve results is now at a final critical point. The people of the country firmly hope for the realization of peace. If, unfortunately, the Japanese army has no intention of repenting, then our nation will only have to seek survival through resistance. As of the evening of the 19th, the situation in Peiping and Tianjin remains serious. (Special telegram on the 19th)

He then left the station and took a car back to his private residence in Wuyiku to rest. Many dignitaries followed to the Zhu residence to wait for an audience. More than a dozen journalists also went to seek an audience. Because Song was busy with official duties, he sent Chen Jiyan, director of the Peiping Municipal Police Bureau, to receive them, convey his apologies, and thank the Peiping press for their donations. He then said that the chairman had just returned to Peiping and could not meet them immediately. He hoped for their understanding. The chairman asked them to convey to everyone that he was determined to uphold the principles of the country's position, the people's position, and the central government's intention in order to resolve the Marco Polo Bridge Incident as soon as possible.

[Peiping] After days of negotiations in Tianjin regarding the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, there has been some progress.

### A Bomb Was Found on Bridge No. 27 of the Beining Railway

Song Zheyuan's Special Train Had Already Passed

[Tianjin] A bomb was found next to Bridge No. 27 on the Beining Railway. At that time, Song Zheyuan's special train to Peiping had already passed. The bomb did not explode, and there was no damage. The bridge is between Yangcun and Shagou. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

### A Large Number of Japanese Troops Opened to Fengtai This Morning

[Tianjin] More than 2,000 Japanese troops, including more than 400 cavalry and several artillery pieces and dozens of machine guns, departed from the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple at 2:10 AM on the 20th, passing through Dongma Road, over the Jingang Bridge, and along the Pingjin Highway from Huangwei Road. They appeared to be heading towards Fengtai. When these Japanese troops departed, some Japanese residents went out to see them off.

### The Scope of Japanese Demands Is Extensive

[Peiping] The belief that the Marco Polo Bridge Incident had been resolved in Tianjin yesterday afternoon was extinguished this morning, according to news from both Chinese and Japanese officialdoms. The Japanese side claimed that the news that Song Zheyuan had apologized for the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was transmitted at the meeting of the Chinese and Japanese authorities yesterday. The Chinese side claimed that both sides had apologized to each other at that time, and both sides acknowledged the other results of the meeting, which were that Zhang Zizhong and Japanese Chief of Staff Hashimoto resolved to continue negotiations and implement the provisions of the July 11 protocol. This morning, a senior Japanese official stated that the wording of the document was broad and that the detailed rules for its implementation still needed to be discussed. Therefore, the Chinese side's verbal recognition is still difficult to regard as a clear and effective agreement. According to the most reliable sources, in addition to the question of interpreting the article on suppressing anti-Japanese movements, the Japanese military authorities are still firmly insisting that the withdrawal of the Chinese army from Wanping must include the withdrawal of the 29th Army stationed in Peiping and the retreat of the 37th Division to the south. Furthermore, the article on punishing responsible personnel can be expanded to include the highest personnel of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, most of whom also concurrently serve as commanders of the 29th Army. Therefore, foreign observers who are qualified to observe the situation all say that this agreement can include a myriad of demands with a very large scope. As for the incident of a Japanese reconnaissance plane shooting at a train in southern Hebei yesterday, it is now known that a total of 150 bullets were fired. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 19th)

### Japanese Troops in Fengtai Advance Towards Marco Polo Bridge

[Peiping] A regiment of Japanese troops from Fengtai, about 1,000 men, carrying more than a dozen artillery pieces, more than a dozen tanks and armored vehicles, and many trains, loaded with military supplies, and more than 30 pack animals, also carrying military supplies, left Dajing Village for Marco Polo Bridge at about 12 PM on the 19th. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

### The Incident of a Japanese Plane Shooting at a Train

[Nanjing] After the news of a Japanese military plane shooting at a train on the Peiping-Hankou Railway on the 18th reached the capital, all circles were extremely indignant. In addition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodging a serious protest with Japan, it is said that if the Japanese side takes such action again, our side will take appropriate measures, and the responsibility for any enlarged situation that may arise in the future should be borne by the Japanese side. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

### The Japanese Side Is Preparing to Transport Troops by Sea

[Tianjin] The Japanese military authorities have ordered the Tanggu Japanese Wharf Company to transport 7,000 tons of coal from the wharf on July 22 and to prepare all cargo ships to be deployed by the Japanese military. It is estimated that they will be used to transport troops by sea. The problem of transporting coal is difficult due to the lack of workers in Tanggu. The Japanese are now inquiring with foreign merchant shipping companies and plan to borrow their cargo ships. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 19th)

[Nanjing] According to reports from Tianjin foreign sources in the capital, all the barges of the Tanggu Transportation Company, which is operated by the Japanese, have been parked and are waiting to be used. However, because the company does not have many barges, they have also hired barges from various foreign shipping companies and limited them to be ready by the 22nd, and it seems that they are preparing to load and transport military equipment to Tianjin. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

### Japanese Plainclothes Teams Are Active in the Suburbs of Peiping

Our side discovered them and immediately rushed to the scene. They contacted each other in the area north of Tsinghua University for about half an hour before being dispersed by us.

They arbitrarily opened and read the incoming and outgoing mail and detained several pieces. All letters inspected by them were stamped with an inspection wood stamp. The Hebei Postal Administration has separately reported to the Ministry of Communications and the Tianjin Municipal Government of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission on the 19th. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

[Tianjin] Officials today admitted that the Japanese authorities did indeed forcibly set up an inspection office in the Postal Administration in the former Russian concession. It is said that the Tianjin Consular Corps will hold a meeting tomorrow to lodge a protest against the Japanese inspection of mail. It is said that mail to and from other provinces in China must be inspected. One of the Japanese inspectors is a White Russian, which shows that mail to the Soviet Union will also be treated in the same way. Airmail from Shanghai to Tianjin has now been suspended indefinitely. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 19th)

### British Troops in Yuguan Gather in Tianjin to Protect Nationals

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Official to Japanese Embassy with Memorandum

Reiterating the intention not to escalate the situation and to resolve it peacefully. Proposing an agreed-upon date for both sides to cease military deployments.

[Nanjing] At 2:30 pm today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched Section Chief Dong Daoning to the Japanese Embassy in China to meet with Counselor Hidaka, and personally delivered a memorandum, the contents of which are as follows:

Since the Lugouqiao Incident, our country has consistently sought not to escalate the situation and has had no intention of provocation. We have repeatedly expressed our willingness to seek a resolution through peaceful means. However, while the Japanese government has also declared its policy of not escalating the situation, it has simultaneously deployed a large number of troops into Hebei Province of our country, and this has not stopped to this day, clearly indicating an intention to use force. Under these circumstances, our government cannot but make appropriate preparations for self-defense, but we are still striving to maintain peace. When the Minister of Foreign Affairs received Counselor Hidaka of the Japanese Embassy on the 12th of this month, he proposed that both sides cease military deployments and withdraw their troops to their original positions. The Japanese side has not responded to this proposal to date, which is deeply regrettable. Now, our government wishes to reiterate its intention not to escalate the situation and to resolve this incident peacefully. We propose again to the Japanese government that both sides agree on a fixed date on which both sides will simultaneously cease military deployments and withdraw the armed forces that have been dispatched to their original positions. Since the Japanese side hopes for peaceful negotiations, it should be willing to accept this proposal. As for the means of resolving this incident, our government is willing to immediately negotiate with the Japanese government through diplomatic channels to reach an appropriate resolution. If there are local issues that can be resolved locally, they must also be with the permission of our central government. In short, the government of Zhao is extremely willing to exhaust all methods to maintain the peace of East Asia. Therefore, our government is happy to accept any peaceful method recognized by international law or international treaties for handling international disputes, such as direct negotiations, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, etc. between the two parties. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)

### Ambassador Xu Arrives in Japan Yesterday

Speaks Upon Passing Through Kobe

[Tokyo] Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, arrived in Kobe at 9:30 am on the 19th, and took a train to Tokyo at noon, arriving at 9:00 pm that evening. In Kobe, he stated that our government adheres to the two major policies of non-escalation and diplomatic resolution. This year is the most important time for China and Japan. The governments and peoples of both countries should work with enthusiasm to improve relations. If the current situation can be handled with justice and sincerity, then a resolution will not be too difficult. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)

[Kobe] After the outbreak of the North China Incident, Ambassador Xu Shiying, who had received important instructions from the Chinese government to return to his post, arrived in Kobe at 9:00 am on the 19th aboard the "President Coolidge." At 12:30 pm, he transferred to a train to Tokyo. On board the ship, Ambassador Xu made a statement to Japanese reporters, saying that after returning to China, he fell ill and did not go to Lushan, and did not carry any specific solutions to the North China Incident. However, the Chinese government has now decided on a resolution policy, which is ① not to escalate the incident, and ② to resolve the incident through diplomatic negotiations. The so-called anti-Japanese theory in China by the Japanese side is actually different from our concept. I firmly believe that no matter which side deals with the situation with sincerity, it will not be difficult to resolve this incident. For the people of China and Japan, this year is the most critical juncture. The greatest efforts and enthusiasm of both countries to improve the current situation are necessary. I sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities will not adhere to the current situation and should strive to resolve the incident from the standpoint of the overall situation in East Asia.

### British Government Watching Far East Situation

Peaceful Resolution Not Completely Hopeless. Foreign Secretary Eden Reports in the House of Commons. Britain Not Considering Convening Nine-Power Treaty Conference.

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that the situation in the Far East remains chaotic and worrying. It is difficult to describe it accurately at present. The causes and responsibilities of the initial conflict have not yet been clarified, and the situation of the negotiations being conducted on the ground is also unknown. However, various phenomena still lead us to believe that the possibility of the current situation, although very serious, was not intentionally created by any government. The Chinese and Japanese governments have both assured the British government that they are extremely willing to avoid escalating the situation, and the British government has also expressed to both countries that the situation will not become more serious, and that a peaceful resolution is a hopeful possibility. The Chinese and Japanese governments have also stated to the British government that the deployment of Chinese and Japanese troops is purely for the purpose of preparation and self-defense, and that there is absolutely no intention of starting a war. The British government has contacted other governments regarding this situation, and the US and French governments have also expressed their concern about the situation and their hope for a peaceful resolution. We sincerely hope that China and Japan can reconcile on their own, without the intervention of a third party. What is most regrettable is that just as the situation in the Far East was gradually improving, and as we hoped, this unfortunate incident suddenly occurred. We do not believe that the interests of China and Japan need to conflict. In recent years, we have watched with sympathy China's efforts to develop its vast resources, but we are also concerned about the economic difficulties faced by Japan. If the British government can suggest a remedy, it would be to say that the remedy lies in changing the method, and genuinely seeking understanding between the two countries, so as to obtain a period of peace and have the opportunity to develop peaceful commerce and mutual communication. If the instability in North China continues to exist, and conflicts are always dealt with by local solutions of questionable scope, then the situation will still be full of crisis. A few weeks ago, we welcomed the Japanese government's approach to Britain, and hoped that this could further improve our relations. We believe that the improvement of British-Japanese relations can enable us to promote the easing of the situation in the Far East. In our view, the easing of the Far East and the prosperity that all parties concerned can gain from the peaceful development of the Far East are greater than what can be obtained by other methods. This is the reason why we are watching the development in the Far East with genuine concern and eagerly hope that the dispute can be resolved as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 19th)

[London] When the House of Commons met today, it involved the crisis in the Far East. Labor MP Henderson asked whether the government was considering convening a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss ways to resolve the constant conflicts between China and Japan.

Current Commentary

### Understandings We Should Have During This Extraordinary Period

— Gao

Since the large-scale arrival and active military deployment of Japanese troops, the suburbs of Peiping have been trampled by the iron hooves of a neighboring country. Traffic is blocked, houses are occupied, and even forced labor is imposed, and vehicles and horses are arbitrarily requisitioned. They take whatever they want, without any regard. Our authorities, while suffering great oppression, still know to be patient and self-respecting, and engage in negotiation. Their sincere intention to maintain peace should be enough for the world to see. However, the Japanese lack sincerity and harbor ambition. Relying on the surrounding fortresses, they rely on threats for the time being. Their aggressive attitude should be something that is difficult for us to tolerate. Although the truth of the negotiations has not been clearly announced, according to Reuters news, unless there is a price of actively changing the administration of Hebei and Chahar, the Japanese authorities will never relax their control over North China. Furthermore, the authorities of Hebei and Chahar have solemnly stated that our side will never recognize any conditions that would humiliate the country, nor will there be any agreement to cede land. Then, there is no possibility of agreement between the two sides, and it is not difficult to infer the conclusion of the future of the negotiations.

At this time of extraordinary transformation, there are several points that we should clearly recognize. First, firmly maintain the established policy and no longer cherish illusions of peace. It must be understood that peace cannot be expected unilaterally, but depends on mutual maintenance. If one party makes it its business to destroy peace, then how can peace be realized? We dare to solemnly declare that an honorable peace is what we seek, but a humiliating peace is difficult to accept. When necessary, we must have the determination to sacrifice everything to meet any adversity. The creed of "宁为玉碎，不为瓦全" (better to be a shattered jade than an intact tile) should be sworn by the whole country, and there must be no more hesitation. Second, believe in the government's spirit of defending the country and give it unanimous and strong support. In times of crisis, only by gathering the will of the whole country can we resist foreign aggression. The trouble lies in distrust and alienation, which breeds internal disharmony and benefits the enemy. This miscalculation is truly heartbreaking. Our government has repeatedly stated its diplomatic position, and Chairman Chiang has made resolute statements. Not only should the national army unite their will and cooperate, but also the people's organizations must be of one mind and strive to be the rearguard. Only in this way can a sound institution be created and the entire strength can be brought into play. Third, we should encourage the soldiers on the front line and not harbor any suspicion. The impression of the heroic resistance of the 29th Army has been deeply engraved in our minds. Even if its one or two leading figures are in a complex environment, there may be places where they cannot fully meet our expectations. We should also understand the original situation and give encouragement. Do not lightly believe in rumors and betray the brave men's loyalty to defend the country. Moreover, under today's circumstances, there is no personal interest to speak of. If there is an official who signs conditions that would humiliate the country, he will certainly not be tolerated by his subordinates. Anyone with a slight brain will not make such a bad move. Fourth, we must take defending the country and resisting aggression as a prerequisite, and abandon all past grievances. When the crisis comes, people's hearts will be uplifted, and there should be no difference in the hatred of the enemy. Even those who are usually despised, if they show a generous expression of serving the country, they should be given sympathy and support. The past can be ignored. For example, Zhang Qingyu's troops of the puppet security team in eastern Hebei did not listen to orders and were detained. This is something worth writing about in detail. The sentence "Chinese people don't fight Chinese people" is enough to show their sincerity. I know that there must be quite a few people in the puppet organization who hold the same mentality. They succumb to the environment of the moment in order to gradually seek appropriate means to repay the country. In our country's history, there are many examples of this. Can we not take this opportunity to persuade them widely and think carefully to entice them, so as to increase our strength to resist aggression?

### Russian and French Newspapers Comment on Situation in North China

Japanese Provocative Actions Against China Could Trigger Major War

[Moscow] The newspaper Pravda commented on the situation in North China, stating, "The Sino-Japanese conflict that broke out due to the provocation of the Japanese warlords in Hebei Province is likely to trigger a major war. At the same time, the Japanese warlords can use the situation in North China to engage in other adventurous actions. This is a serious threat to world peace." (TASS dispatch on the 18th)

[Paris] Most newspapers here still hope that China and Japan can reach a compromise agreement, but they do not hide the possibility of war in the Far East. The Paris Soir commented that the war between China and Japan may have certain limitations, as the Soviet Union may not be able to participate in the conflict between China and Japan due to the tense political situation in Europe. As for the League of Nations, it has proven to be very lacking in ability in handling Sino-Japanese incidents in 1931 and 1932, and will not intervene again this time." The Communist newspaper L'Humanité stated, "Japan's true intention is to threaten the Soviet Union." The famous Tanaka Memorial of former Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka stated that Japan cannot attack Russia unless it has dominated half of China's territory. Moreover, since Germany and Japan concluded an alliance, it is even more possible for Japan to attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, the German party must participate in the current Sino-Japanese dispute, which is well known to everyone. The right-wing Le Figaro said, "Currently, China and Japan are taking a tough stance. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement in the last few hours, no one can predict how the incidents that have already begun will end. In recent years, China's national defense has been greatly enhanced, so Japan's military actions will inevitably encounter difficulties. However, the United States is closely watching this incident, and the last line of defense for maintaining peace in the Far East, it is hoped that it will be here."

Government aircraft also took to the skies to engage the enemy. More Nationalist aircraft arrived to assist, bringing the total number of aircraft involved in the battle to over 160. Government aircraft used machine guns for strafing, while the Nationalist forces had several new fighter planes equipped with small cannons that fired very rapidly.

### Shift in Tone of British Conservative Newspapers

Favoring the Spanish Rebels

[London] Today marks the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, and various newspapers have published articles commenting on the conflict. The attitude adopted by conservative newspapers clearly favors one side in the Spanish Civil War. For example, The Times stated that since the Nationalist forces captured the port of Malaga in southern Spain, the government-controlled territories have experienced a severe shortage of food. Conversely, the Nationalist-controlled territories have a surplus of food, and it is expected that this year's harvest will be abundant. Furthermore, after the Nationalist forces captured the port of Bilbao, they gained control of a portion of the iron ore mines in the city of Huesca. In terms of finance, they have no shortage of funds to supply their war effort. Therefore, the Nationalist-controlled territories have strict rule of law and good order. The Morning Post stated, "The brave Spain of the Archbishop will rise up and drive out its barbaric enemies, just as the ancient Spaniards drove out the forces of Islam. General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, is currently carrying out a great work of liberation. Wherever his troops go, they pacify the area and consolidate order, allowing Spain to recover its former glory. General Franco is fighting against a conspiracy that threatens not only Spain but also our country and other nations. Therefore, our government and people should be eternally grateful to General Franco." Furthermore, the Daily Mail issued a warning, stating that "Britain failed in the Abyssinian War because it aided the weaker party. We should not repeat the same mistake in the future."

### French Government Financial Consolidation

Drafts First Batch of Plans

[Paris] Regarding the issue of financial consolidation, the French government has drafted the first batch of plans, which will be announced and implemented through delegated legislation. The aim is to restore balance to the current year's regular budget. The second batch of plans concerns the appropriation of funds for the current year and the provisional budget for the coming year. This batch was approved yesterday by the cabinet sub-committee and is scheduled to be submitted to the Council of State for approval tomorrow. Financial experts recently stated that the implementation of the first batch of plans is expected to increase national revenue by 70 billion to 80 billion francs, which is close to the amount of the current year's regular budget deficit. It is anticipated that the regular budget for the coming year can be fully restored to balance as a result. However, the international financial situation has not been fully resolved. The national treasury faces four main burdens: (1) A regular budget deficit of 70 billion to 80 billion francs, which is expected to be restored to balance by 1938. (2) A railway deficit of 8 billion francs, which will be reduced to 4 billion francs. (3) The national defense expenditure stipulated in the provisional budget. (4) The combined value of various maturing government bonds, which totals 270 billion francs by the end of this year and will reach at least 300 billion francs by 1938.

### The World's Military Expenditures Approaching Wartime Levels (Part 1)

—Yi Zang

In today's complex international situation, the most noteworthy issue is the alarming increase in military expenditures by various countries. Everyone senses that this phenomenon will lead the world to a devastating end. Therefore, the unified goal of peace-loving people around the world is to find ways to stop this terrible trend. However, to remedy the crisis of escalating military spending in various countries, it is necessary to first understand the crisis clearly. Now, let's examine this issue specifically from a historical perspective.

Take England and France as examples of European countries. Their military expenditures showed almost no change in the 30 years before 1850. In England, there was even a tendency to decrease. However, since the Crimean War and the Franco-Austrian-Italian War, the competition for military expansion in Europe has gradually become blatant. By 1914, when the Great War broke out, the military figures in Europe had swelled to an alarming extent. According to statistics compiled in 1929 by Swedish scholar Yaggopson, the state of expansion of military expenditures in Europe before the Great War was as follows: (Unit: million pounds)

According to the table above, military expenditures in European countries in 1913 had increased fivefold compared to the 50 years before the Great War. In the five years between 1908 and 1913 (the five years before the outbreak of the Great War), they increased by fifty percent. After the war, a temporary atmosphere of peace permeated the world. Countries then focused on recovery efforts and had to reduce military expenditures. According to the League of Nations' military yearbook, the total military expenditures of the five major powers, including England, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia, in 1926 was 1.59 billion yuan, a decrease of almost 300 million yuan compared to 1.7788 billion yuan in 1913. However, the military expenditures of countries outside of Europe increased instead, so the total world military expenditure for that year was 3.614 billion yuan, an increase of more than 20% compared to the 2.9073 billion yuan in 1913. After the September 18th Incident and the establishment of the National Socialist regime in Germany, the rearmament competition centered on Japan and Germany began and spread to the whole world. After the Italian-Abyssinian War and the reoccupation of the Rhineland, the arms race intensified. According to a survey by Hansen of the American Council on Foreign Relations, the total military expenditure of 60 countries in the world in 1936 reached 7.737 billion US dollars, more than twice the 5.0641 billion US dollars in 1934. Generally speaking, these countries have spent one-tenth of their national income on military preparations and allocated more than half of their tax revenue to military expenditures.

### Japanese Army Massively Pressures Northern Chahar in the Pingjin Area

Bandits and Puppets Put on a Show of Force Against Sui, but in Reality, They Are Powerless to Invade the West

Zhangbei Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese army has been provoking incidents in the Wanping and suburbs of Beiping in Yipobo, so it seems that it is not giving much attention to the northern Chahar area. Because the Chahar bandits and puppet army feel that they have lost their support and are afraid of being attacked by the Sui army, they are very vigilant. Therefore, planes from a certain side (that is, those who support the bandits and puppets) have been repeatedly flying from Shangdu to Hong Geertu, Damiaozi, Bailinzhao, and other places to conduct reconnaissance. Their purpose is to deliberately show an offensive posture. Judging from the current situation, the bandits and puppets have no power to invade the west. Firstly, the Japanese army is paying attention to the Lugouqiao battle and has no time to take care of other things. Secondly, righteous armies have risen up everywhere, and the bandits and puppets do not dare to invade the west.

De Wang Harshly Exploits for Personal Gain

Regarding the problems within the bandits and puppets themselves, De Wang and Li Shouxin have not returned to their old friendship. Zhuo Shihai's troops are demoralized and cannot fight. Therefore, recently De Wang has taken the opportunity to limit the employment and collection of club donations in various counties in order to enrich himself and has ordered each county to set up wireless radio stations. Moreover, Japanese aircraft pilots have been repeatedly flying over Sui province to conduct reconnaissance of everything. In addition, there are currently no military actions.

The Japanese Side Transports Military Supplies

The Zhangjiakou Wanguo Company has always been a Japanese agency for the import and export of military supplies. The Japanese side has stored a lot of military supplies in the company. On the 15th of this month, three trucks arrived at the company loaded with mortar shells, and another truck was fully loaded with gasoline, which was transported to Zhangbei. It is said that these military supplies will be transported through Rehe to eastern Hebei. According to a related source, since the Lugouqiao Incident, more than 6,000 Japanese Kwantung Army troops have entered eastern Hebei from Rehe. In addition, the Japanese secret service agency in Zhangbei has now bought over 300 Chinese traitors to form a vanguard team, which has now been established. It is unknown where they will be sent.

The Number of Japanese Nationals Returning Home Increases

Since the 13th of this month, more and more Japanese nationals from various places have been passing through Zhangbei on their way back to Japan. Some of them took the PingSui Railway to Zhangjiakou from Sui province, and then took a car through Zhangbei, Dolun, and Rehe, and returned to Japan via the puppet ChengShen Railway. Another part is Japanese nationals in Zhangjiakou. This shows the Japanese side's long-term plan. The reason why they have not yet broken off peaceful negotiations with our authorities is that their troops have not yet been fully assembled, so they are using a delaying tactic. According to a certain military expert, the Japanese army is now using this method against us, which occupies a great advantage. Because they do not immediately go through the formalities of declaring war, and at the same time actively increase their troops, if we always compromise in this way, they will rely on their material reserves and sophisticated equipment, and secretly build extremely solid defensive works and strong fire networks. In the shortest time, they can complete it. At that time, if our side wants to recover an inch of land, it will take a great sacrifice.

The Current Situation of the Northern Chahar People's Army

Under the current situation, the Northern Chahar People's Army could have achieved something, but unfortunately, its leaders, such as Li Tingfang and Li Ying, suddenly withdrew. Only Zhang Zhongying is still leading his troops to wait for an opportunity to launch an uprising between Sui and Chahar West. It is said that Zhang's troops have gathered more than 1,000 people, with guns and horses complete, and the morale is high. They plan to recover Shangdu or Shangyi county near the city. Chen Bingjun had previously gathered 600 comrades in a certain place in the interior. Now, due to the Lugouqiao Incident, the actions of the troops have been blocked. (15th)

### 85,000 Tons of Steel Materials Are Exported to Japan from Northeast Every Year

—For the Use of Military and Industrial Needs—

Shenyang Correspondence: The issue of exporting steel materials from the Northeast to Japan, which is currently being resolved by Minami Haruji, a director of the Japanese-Manchurian Commercial Affairs Council, has been decided to be approximately 85,000 tons of steel materials per year, in order to alleviate Japan's steel shortage and achieve the goal of supplying military and industrial needs.

### Sudden Activities of Taiwanese in Fuzhou

Recently, the number of Taiwanese in Fuzhou has increased. They are planning to reorganize the Youth Volunteer Corps.

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of war in Hebei Province, the activities of Japanese and Taiwanese people in Fujian have attracted considerable attention. Recently, in various counties of southern Fujian, there has been a type of foreigner who, under the guise of travel, has been penetrating into the inland villages, inquiring about social conditions and local situations. Their intentions are unfathomable. Yesterday, the provincial government issued an order to all counties that henceforth, anyone entering the territory for travel must have a passport from our government or a certificate from party and government organizations to be given attention. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to visit various places. Jinjiang, Huian, and other counties have already organized patrol teams in each district. If any foreigners of unknown origin are found mingling in the countryside, whether selling medicine or peddling groceries, they will be ordered to leave the country in order to maintain public order. On the provincial capital side, after the Japanese Consulate General Police Chief Tango Ichi was transferred to Tianjin, Onozaki Fumima was appointed by the Taiwan Governor's Office. Because he expressed great sympathy for the behavior of the Taiwanese people in Fujian, the relationship between the Taiwanese people and the new police chief is extremely harmonious. Recently, the number of Taiwanese people arriving in Fuzhou from Taiwan and Xiamen has suddenly increased. The affairs of the Taiwan Public Association have also expanded. The president of the association, Lin Xiangxiong, convened a committee meeting at the Cangxia Isle Association Hall the night before last to discuss association affairs. Onozaki and important personnel from the Japanese consulate were present. Many important resolutions were made on the spot, which will give full play to its original mission. In addition, the members of the Taiwan Youth Volunteer Corps organized by the association are all given uniforms and pistols, specializing in protecting the businesses of Taiwanese people's opium dens, gambling houses, pawnshops, and "Taiji" (Taiwanese bases). It was suspended for reasons before, but now there is a tendency to restore the organization. However, recently, the opium dens opened by the Taiwanese people suddenly received an order from the consulate prohibiting the accommodation of private prostitutes and hooligans. In addition, high-interest loan operations are also planning to tighten up, but the reason is unknown. (July 7, 17th)

### The Japanese Government Encourages the Planting of Oil-Producing Plants

Vegetable oil can be used to manufacture military supplies, with a national output value of more than 8.2 billion.

Tokyo Correspondence: In order to thoroughly implement its continental policy, Japan is actively preparing for war. It is absorbing as much raw materials as possible for military industrial production. Recently, it has paid special attention to vegetable oil, which can be used to manufacture military supplies. Through the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the government is encouraging people to plant and manufacture various oils that are useful for military and chemical industries. According to the results of a recent survey, the quantity and price of oil produced in Japan are as follows:

### The Yangtze River's Water Level Rises Sharply, River Water Backflows into Poyang Lake

More than one million disaster victims. The Provincial Relief Committee allocates funds for emergency relief.

Raozhou Correspondence: During the recent major flood period in our province, the Fu River and the Gan River surged, only a few centimeters short of the maximum flood record of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Jiyi Embankment collapsed due to a lack of prevention, and the foundation of the Qidu Embankment in Xingzi was weak, causing disasters. The rest of the embankments were fortunately preserved without incident due to effective defense. The most severely affected counties in the Yangtze River basin this time are Gan County, Ji'an, Taihe, Xin'gan, Qingjiang, Xiajiang, Fengcheng, and other counties in the Gan River basin. Next are Yifeng, Yitang, Shangrao, and other counties in the Fu and Xin River basins. Next are Yongxiu and other counties in the Xiu River basin. Because there are no embankments upstream of the Gan River and the river is very long, once there is a mountain flood, the water cannot be discharged in time, resulting in flooding. According to the disaster reports from various counties, the estimated number of disaster victims is approximately one million, and the area of ​​affected farmland is approximately two million mu. The Relief Committee is currently selecting the most severely affected counties for emergency relief. Although the water levels of the rivers are gradually receding, the Yangtze River is continuing to rise sharply, reaching 4.022 meters, entering a dangerous period. The water level is so high that it exceeds the rivers in our province, causing the Yangtze River to backflow into Poyang Lake. The floodwaters from the rivers are blocked from flowing downstream, making the embankments along the lake precarious. The receding period will also be extended as a result. Yan Fangong, director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, in addition to ordering Yun Xiang, director of the Fifth District (Jingde) Flood Control, to strictly protect and consolidate the embankments, also went to Jiujiang to inspect a few days ago and consulted with Engineer Zhang of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission on flood control to ensure safety.

### Not Public, Nor Hygienic

— Huang Yiqing

Broadcast on the Shanghai Sino-Western Radio Station on July 13th, in place of Mr. Zhu Hengbi

Mr. Song Guobin published a wonderful article in the Shanghai Shen Bao's medical and pharmaceutical supplement. The title is "Public Not Hygienic." The general idea is that all actions are hygienic if they are not "public," and unhygienic if they are "public." Therefore, the term "public health" itself has some flaws and doesn't make sense. It's said in a very humorous and thorough way. However, in order to avoid easy misunderstanding by the public, I believe that Mr. Song's statement "Public Not Hygienic" is just like the term "public health" that he suspects has some flaws, somewhat unique, somewhat biased towards the public's own caution, and abandons the important principle of collective wisdom and concerted efforts to defend, so it must be supplemented. Now, taking advantage of the fact that Dr. Zhu Hengbi temporarily asked me to broadcast on his behalf, I will talk to everyone:

I think that in an unhygienic environment and public habits that are not hygienic, "public" is indeed on the opposite side of "hygienic"—I have also loudly called for publicity in the newspapers. But if you really want to live a hygienic life, you must gather the strength of the public, rely on public power, actively carry out various health undertakings, and implement various health regulations, which is also impossible. For example, now that it's hot, you're playing on the street or in the park, and suddenly you want to drink water. There are no fountains in public places (of course, the fountains must be hygienic, using xenon gas to kill bacteria and sand-filtered water). Where can you get hygienic water? Isn't this fountain installed by public power? Also, the rivers everywhere are so dirty. If your whole family wants to drink or use truly hygienic water, isn't it necessary to rely on public power to establish a waterworks to conquer the bad environment of nature? The feces, garbage, and food waste of every household must rely on public power to establish a fertilizer factory, cleaning team, and garbage disposal plant to clean up the bad environment created by humans and make it clean and hygienic. Also, to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, if you don't rely on public power to fundamentally eliminate their larvae and pupae in the wild on a large scale, how can you do it? To prevent smallpox and ensure the safety of a territory, if you don't rely on public power to vaccinate the public with cowpox on a large scale, how can you do it? To prevent and treat tuberculosis, if you don't rely on public power to carry out large-scale health insurance and build special prevention hospitals everywhere, how can you do it? To prevent the spread of any epidemic, whether it is to eliminate the virus, eliminate the medium of transmission, or give vaccinations, if you don't rely on public power to set up disinfection teams and epidemic prevention teams, or rely on certain powers specially granted to the public to effectively deal with it, how can you do it? To expand on this, even the most hygienic countries have long known that even in terms of treatment, if all doctors are not hired by the government to implement a public medical system, it is impossible to popularize public health to the whole people.

To go back to what I was saying, even if you really want to eliminate unhygienic environments from a negative perspective, you must rely on public power to rectify them. For example, prostitutes, since they cannot be called non-existent in the current society, then naturally the government must carry out medical examinations and crack down on them at any time to obtain greater public health benefits. Since the unhygienic situations in restaurants, bathhouses, barbershops, theaters, etc. are created by the unhygienic public (if there are absolutely no people with infectious diseases in the public, it doesn't matter), and this unhygienic public is the absolutely majority of the current society, then naturally the government must carry out health inspections and crack down on them at any time to control them to obtain greater public health benefits. Extending this to the need for public testing and inspection of cold drinks, milk, etc., the need for public management and supervision of slaughterhouses, small vegetable markets, swimming pools, etc., the need for some kind of power to ensure the safety and hygiene of factories and make them meet standards, the need for some kind of power to prevent quack doctors and midwives from disregarding human life, and the need for some kind of publicly established rules and power to implement port quarantine between ports, provinces, and internationally, cannot be done by any individual in any group.

Therefore, it is said that people are social animals after all and cannot be independent from the group. From a negative point of view, unhygienic public places or common behaviors may be or even are unhygienic. But to conquer nature and reorganize the bad environment created by humans, it is necessary to pool wisdom and efforts and rely on the power synthesized and granted by the public. A large part of the true meaning of hygiene is that the public must have the urge and desire to be hygienic, demand a common goal of hygiene from the public, eliminate unhygienic situations on the one hand to make them gradually relatively hygienic, and carry out hygienic undertakings that individuals cannot do alone and must be done publicly on the other hand. Only then can it be perfected.

In other words, one part of the principle of hygiene is to encourage everyone to "respect individuality"———to be careful on their own———while another part is to encourage everyone to "enjoy community"———to defend together———. It is inappropriate to be communal when one should be individual: it is also difficult to be individual when one should be communal. Passive actions are often unhygienic when they are public, while active measures are not easily hygienic unless they are public. On the one hand, in an environment with extremely good public hygiene, the public can respect individuality: on the other hand, each member of the public must know how to extend their respect for individuality to others so that the public can have a good public hygiene environment. Community is to make up for the lack of individuality: individuality is to save the malpractices of community. It is reasonable to see things and do things in their respective ways.

Mr. Song may have heard my words and will certainly agree. What do you all think?

As for the fact that "public health" should be translated as "public health," this is what I extremely advocate. This term can really be called "public health." Because Hygiene, which is opposed to public health, has long been translated as hygiene or personal hygiene, so one side is called public health. The late famous doctor Yu Fengbin wrote articles promoting hygiene in the Shanghai Shen Bao's Free Talk fifteen or sixteen years ago. At the same time, Hu Xuanming, the first person in our country to study hygiene, and Yiqing co-translated the world's famous hygiene book Luo's Hygiene, and both used "public health" early on. However, later, people in general became accustomed to the common name and used public health. Rather than saying that it should be re-translated, it should be reused! This is the deliberation of the term hygiene, which is not of great significance.

Press Association

Chairman Song and all the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army in Beiping, Gong Jian. The enemy has planned to挑寡行动 and moved on to large-scale aggression. The hidden malice is obvious to the world. When the alarm of the Lugouqiao incident came, the blood气乏伦、罔不髮指. Fortunately, you and others heroically resisted the war,浴血杀故、气壮河山、威震遐迩. The enemy could not succeed, so he advocated peace talks as a means of绥兵 to wait for reinforcements. Now he has mobilized the whole country and倾师人我国门. Under these circumstances, we cannot obtain peace, and there is no other way than to fight. The survival of the country and the nation is finally at stake. The safety of North China depends entirely on you and others. Please quickly abandon the peace talks and continue the war. The compatriots of the whole country will, under the leadership of the central government, unanimously be the backing for you and others. I hereby send a telegram of comfort, respectfully waiting for good news. Shanghai Press Association, Qiao Yin.

### Rice Industry Telegraphes the Central Government to Prohibit Grain Exports

Tong Rupu Haitu and other fellow villagers telegraphed Beijing

Shanghai Rice Industry Association sent a telegram via express mail: President Chiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister of Finance Kong Jun Jian. We, Ou Zhao, are oppressed by the Japanese aggressors in Hebei. Compatriots across the country are united in their hatred of the enemy, united in their anger and resistance. At this time of extraordinary and serious national crisis, the national defense front is of great importance, and food is also an important national defense need. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance issued an order a few days ago to prohibit the export of flour and wheat in order to prevent資敌用. Although the export of flour and wheat has been prohibited by order, other rice and grains are also a major source of food. Since no clear order has been issued to prohibit their export, it is feared that they will be transported out and used to資敌. The food supply in the rear is also very important and should be prepared in advance so that it can be controlled when necessary. We hereby urgently request that the Ministry of Finance quickly order the strict prohibition of the export of flour and wheat and issue an order prohibiting the export of rice and grains to maintain the needs of national defense and to relieve the food supply in the rear. The Shanghai Rice Industry Association kowtows Hao.

Also, Tong Ru Chonghai and other five counties telegraphed the National Government in Nanjing, requesting that the Hebei and Chahar authorities be strictly ordered not to be diplomatic guards and to issue a clear order to send troops to protect our territory, to give a new vision to the world and to correct the hearts of the people of the whole country. Decisive action must be taken to protect our national rights, etc.

The amount and names of buyers and sellers in each exchange from July 10th to 20th must still be submitted to the Office." Item 9 of the same regulations stipulates that "Each exchange should immediately stop futures trading for this month and settle outstanding transactions." The exchanges stated that clients are scattered across various locations and could not be notified in time, and requested that the deadline for settling this month's transactions be extended to July 20th. This Office has telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to request instructions. The Ministry replied, "The two telegrams from Jia are acknowledged.

The proposed method of allowing legitimate factories to commission trading before Jia under the responsibility of the exchanges, and reporting the amounts and names, should be followed. The settlement of wheat flour and miscellaneous grains exchanges' transactions for this month is approved to be extended to Jia. Please comply." Therefore, all futures trading should be conducted with registration certificates from July 21st onward. The amount and names of buyers and sellers from July 10th to 20th must still be submitted.

They will jointly investigate and distribute the funds with the provincial relief funds. (2) Regarding the previous meeting's resolution to consult with the Boy Scout troop to conduct door-to-door fundraising, on June 25th and 26th, all Boy Scouts in the city were mobilized to conduct fundraising in the public concessions, raising a total of 6,778.52 yuan in national currency. (3) The Golden Grand Theater's three-day charity performance has yielded 6,986.90 yuan in legal tender (after deducting 365.60 yuan for advertising expenses and 300 yuan for venue costs). Matters for discussion: (1) Director Lu Bohong requested that, given the Ministry of Finance's additional allocation of 100,000 yuan for Henan relief, the association also allocate 10,000 yuan to jointly investigate and distribute the funds. The request was approved and a resolution was passed to retroactively approve the allocation. (2) Chairman Zhao Cilong telegraphed You Chouzhen, hoping for an early donation to save the disaster victims. It was resolved to allocate 10,000 yuan for emergency relief. (3) The Shanghai Municipal Government sent a letter regarding a letter from the Qinghai Provincial Mass Organizations United Relief Appeal Committee, stating that the disaster situation was extremely severe and requesting a swift remittance of funds for relief, along with the attached donation list. (4) The Fujian Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai sent a letter stating that more than 40 counties in Fujian Province have been affected by floods, requesting a swift allocation of substantial funds for emergency relief and requesting the initiation of the establishment of a fundraising association. The above two cases were discussed together, and it was resolved to decide after verifying the disaster situation in the two provinces with the Central Relief Commission. (5) As of yesterday, the association's delayed relief donations still amounted to 38,589.77 yuan. Most of these funds were donated by overseas Chinese. The patriotic overseas Chinese stated that the funds could only be used to help the refugees in our region. Delayed relief has already ended, but the compatriots in the Lugouqiao area are suffering in the scorching summer heat and under heavy artillery fire, with nowhere to turn. Could personnel be assigned to be responsible for using these funds to provide relief? After discussing the case, it was resolved to allocate funds for relief immediately after the Beiping Relief Branch investigates the war zone disaster situation.

### Shanghai Documentation Association Initiates Publication of the "Su Song Tai Series"

Scheduled to Return Exhibits Starting August 10th

The Shanghai Documentation Exhibition, together with other exhibitions, closed on the afternoon of the 18th. Yesterday (the 19th) at 9:00 AM, the association invited responsible persons from various counties to hold a meeting at the YMCA of Baixianqiao. Attendees included President Ye Yuhu, Executive Directors Chen Duanzhi, Wu Hufan, Shen Weijun, Lu Danlin, Wu Jingshan, and others, as well as the collection directors from various counties: Yao Yuqin and Lin Erqing from Shanghai City, Qin Bowen from Shanghai County, Lei Junyan from Songjiang, Yao Shizi (represented by Chen) from Jinshan, Gu Bingyi from Nanhui, Zhang Bochun from Chuansha, Zhang Hongnian from Jiading, Jin Jushan from Baoshan, and Chen Ziqing from Suzhou. President Ye presided over the meeting.

Reporting Items

The President first reported: (1) The association respects the opinions of the exhibitors and therefore closed early, at the same time as other exhibitions, yesterday afternoon. The unavoidable difficulties are understood by everyone present. Because of the need to handle the closing and many matters that require discussion with the responsible persons from various counties, everyone was invited to meet here today. However, the notices were sent out too late, and it is feared that some of you from afar may not have been able to arrive in time. I apologize. (2) Because the number of exhibits received this time was very large, and most of them were delivered after June 25th, with some arriving in early July, the office staff was too small and unable to keep up. More than ten middle school students were temporarily hired to copy labels, resulting in many errors. The catalog was compiled based on the labels, so there are also many errors in the catalog. We apologize to the exhibitors and visitors. Furthermore, many fine exhibits that were prepared to be replaced were not displayed due to the early closing. We apologize even more. (3) During the two-week exhibition period, the average daily number of visitors was around 2,000. In addition to people from this city and the ten counties, many visitors came from afar from Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other places. Some even visited continuously for five or six times. After the advertisement for the early closing was published, many letters requesting an extension were received. Even in this time of sweltering heat and tense situation, many people are still paying attention to this, which shows that the society is no longer as indifferent to local documentation as it used to be. (4) There are many excellent exhibits this time. In order to leave a permanent souvenir, the association plans to compile and print a "Special Shanghai Documentation Issue." In addition to selecting about 200 representative exhibits from various categories, it will also include the preparation process, exhibit catalog, etc. The editing has already begun, and the book is expected to be published in September. We also plan to compile and print abstracts of various fine works to publicize the great achievements of the philosophers of the ten counties to the national academic community. A summary of the publication committee's rules and a list of committee members are printed on separate paper. Please revise and supplement them. (5) Among the exhibits, the books numbered around 3,000, and there were many rare books, including many rare editions and important manuscripts. It is planned to use the books from the second Shanghai and Wuzhong exhibitions as a foundation, and further engage in selection and printing of the "Su Song Tai Series." I expressed my opinion in the Dagongbao on the 16th of this month. Please advise. Because this matter is of great importance, it cannot be started rashly without detailed research by people from various places. However, after the end of the Documentation Association, whether there should be another organization to carry out this project is a matter for everyone to discuss.

(3) On the proposal to form a publication committee, the rules were adopted, and several committee members and reviewers were elected (the rules and list of names are attached).

### Xu Shujian Cohabitates with Prostitute, Wife Reports to Police, Arrest Made

Police Prosecute for Disrupting Family; Possible Reconciliation Leads to Postponement of Hearing

Anhui woman Gong Baoxian, 36 years old, is the daughter of Ding Jiahou, a respected family in Anhui. Ding held important positions during the Qing Dynasty. After the revolution, he retired to Shanghai and engaged in the silver and money business, gaining a good reputation in the financial world. He had two daughters. Baoxian was the younger daughter and was deeply loved by her father. After she came of age, her parents were very strict in choosing a son-in-law, because rich boys are often spoiled. Later, they met Xu Shujian (33 years old, engaged in exchange business) from Wujin (Changzhou), who was young and promising. They disregarded social status and married Baoxian to him in 1924 at the Mengyuan Hotel in Shanghai. Later, they cohabited at No. 3 Junyi Lane, Avenue Edward VII. Unexpectedly, after marriage, Xu Shujian saw that his wife was wealthy and spent his days loafing about and indulging in vices. He squandered his wife's dowry. Gong Baoxian was bound by etiquette and had children, so she could only lament her fate and endure it without complaint. Xu Shujian has been asking his wife for money in recent years, and even though his wishes were granted, his love waned as his money ran out. Recently, he secretly cohabited with a prostitute, Zhang Zhujun (26 years old, from Suzhou, known as Rouge No. 7 or Yuan Yuan No. 7), renting a house together at No. 675, Rue Pichon in the French Concession, living as husband and wife. He treated his wife as an old fan, abandoning her and ignoring her. Gong Baoxian discovered this and, unable to bear it any longer, hired three lawyers, Zhang Fayao, Hua Maosheng, and Yuan Yang'an, to report to the French Concession Police. The Loukaza Central Police dispatched detective Yang Yilong to No. 675, Rue Pichon at 7:00 AM on the 17th and arrested both Xu Shujian and Zhang Zhujun. They were taken back to the police station for detention. Zhang was later bailed out. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Branch Court, where Judge Qiu Huanxing presided over the hearing. The plaintiff, Gong Baoxian, and her three lawyers, Zhang, Hua, and Yuan, appeared in court. After questioning the defendants' ages and origins, the police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the case, prosecuting them for disrupting the family and marriage under Article 239 of the Criminal Code. Then, the plaintiff testified about the process of reporting and arresting the defendants for adultery and cohabitation. Xu Shujian confessed that he met Zhang Zhujun at the Zhimeilou for business entertainment and developed a relationship. Zhang Zhujun confessed that Xu was a business customer and that she only knew he had a concubine at home, but did not know he had a wife. They also hired two lawyers, Wan Weijian and Lu Ruizheng, for their defense. The court, believing that the case was clear, ordered the opening of the debate. The defendant's defense lawyer stated that there was a possibility of reconciliation and requested a postponement. The court agreed to the defendant's request for bail. The court then ordered the postponement of the hearing to the morning of the 12th. The defendants were granted bail to their respective defense lawyers.

### American Woman Detained for Carrying Narcotics, Sent to Shanghai

The English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports: An American woman, Mrs. Evers, 48 years old, was found carrying narcotics on July 6th while traveling by train from Peiping to Anyang, Henan. She was discovered by the Chinese police. After five days of local investigation, she was ordered to be sent to the American Consulate General in Hankou. This morning (the 19th), she was escorted to Shanghai by Mr. Belford, an official of the U.S. Court for China, by boat from Hankou. After consultation with Chief Judge Hilmi, she was ordered to post bail of US$10,000. Because she was unable to provide this large sum, she is currently detained in the Ward Road Jail. The woman claims that the narcotics she was carrying were not hers, but belonged to a Chinese student she was teaching English to, who asked her to take them to Anyang. She claims she did not know they were prohibited items. It is reported that the woman is from San Francisco. Her husband died 14 years ago. She has been in China for nine years and lived in Shanghai for four years. In 1932, she went to Peiping and made a living teaching English. She went to Anyang this time to enter a church hospital there for treatment.

### Woman Uses Husband's Name to Sue for Fraud

Because She Is Not a Directly Injured Party, the Court Rules the Case Inadmissible

Xu Jin, a woman from Jiancheng, 37 years old, residing at No. 2 Yuqing Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, used her husband Xu Lianfa's name at the local court to sue lawyer Shi Youfu and detective Lu Rongshi for fraud. Judge Zhang Yanshui presided over the hearing yesterday morning. Xu Jin stated that she was 33 years old and from Jiancheng. Xu Lianfa is her husband. He did not come because he had matters in his hometown. Shi Youfu is the one I am suing. I used my husband's name because he is suing my husband, I have sent a letter to notify him, and a reply has not yet arrived, but it should be arriving in Shanghai soon. As for suing Shi and Lu Rongshi, I don't want to punish them. I only ask the judge to seek justice and clarify the facts. My husband owed an Indian 550 yuan. During the execution period, Lu bailed my husband out. At that time, he said he would repay the money and asked us to make a note to Lu Rongshi. The first time, I returned 195 yuan to Lu, and later I returned 130 yuan. However, Lu entrusted lawyer Shi to sue for the debt and lawyer Shi privately signed for the execution, etc. Lu Rongbao stated that he was 35 years old, from Jiancheng, a detective, residing at No. 9, Tonghe Lane, the intersection of Maigen Road and Wuding Road. Xu Lianfa owed the Indian 650 yuan and was detained by the First Special Court. I was the owner of a car dealership and they asked me to bail him out. I paid 100 yuan. Later, because they repeatedly failed to pay, the Indian wanted to seal my car dealership and auction it off. Therefore, I advanced more than 300 yuan to the Indian. Because they repeatedly failed to pay, his husband issued a note for 550 yuan. He is cunning and refuses to pay, so I asked lawyer Shi to sue him, etc. Shi Youfu stated that he was 36 years old, from Chongming, and a lawyer residing at No. 192, Avenue Foch. In December 1934, Lu Rongbao entrusted me to sue Xu Lianfa for the loan. Later, the court ordered Xu to repay 485 yuan. Xu refused and appealed. The two parties then reached a settlement to pay 450 yuan in installments, but Xu repeatedly failed to pay, so I petitioned the court for execution. These are all legal procedures and there is no fraud. The plaintiff is ignorant and has made a false accusation, so I filed a counterclaim, etc. The court ruled that Xu Jin was not a directly injured party and could not sue. Xu Lianfa himself has not filed a lawsuit. It is not in accordance with legal procedure for her to sue on his behalf. This case is not accepted, and the counterclaim is also not accepted.

### Difficult to Make a Living Overseas: Four Overseas Chinese Return Home, All from Qingtian, Zhejiang

Affected by the economic recession in various countries, the overseas Chinese are facing difficult lives. As a result, quite a few are returning home.

They reported to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and returned to their hometown yesterday.

### Shao Axing Assassination Case: Murderer Transferred to Shanghai

Murderer Was Originally a Disciple of the Deceased; Held a Grudge After Being Expelled and Committed Murder

Shao Axing from Ningbo was a former detective who accumulated several thousand yuan and opened an electrical supplies store on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. He resided at No. 3, Aidu Lane, Lane 14, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, in the French Concession. Tao Huxing, a native of Haiyan, Zhejiang, 35 years old, was Shao's disciple and stayed at Shao's home, working as a servant. In early September of last year, Shao ordered Tao to deliver a funeral gift. Unexpectedly, Tao delivered it to a wedding, causing a dispute. Shao hated Tao to the bone and expelled him. Tao was mediocre and had nowhere to eat or sleep outside, so he had murderous intent. On the morning of the 13th of that month, while Shao's wife, Lin, was returning to Ningbo, Tao broke into Shao's bedroom. When Shao was fast asleep, he held a wooden stick with iron nails and struck Shao's head several times. He then looted all the cash and jewelry, worth about 2,000 yuan, and fled. Shao was knocked unconscious. It was not until 9:00 AM that his sister, Wu Shao, discovered him and reported it to the French Police, who took Shao to Guangci Hospital, but he died before treatment could be administered. He was 40 years old. The body was reported to the Second Special Court, which sent personnel to investigate. The body was collected for burial. The police searched for the murderer. It has been reported in the newspaper. Wu Yiming, the deceased's nephew, learned that the murderer was hiding in Tao's hometown of Haiyan and reported it to the French Police, who dispatched detectives to Haiyan to arrest Tao Huxing with the local police. He was transferred to Shanghai. Yesterday, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Second Special Court, where Judge Sun Pengxian questioned him. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that the defendant had requested a postponement of the investigation of the murder case and requested a trial. Tao confessed to killing Shao Axing. The court ordered the postponement of the hearing to 11:00 AM on the 26th and ordered the defendant to be detained.

### German University Professor Conquers Mankind's Greatest Enemy

▲ The tiny diplococcus has spread all over the world! ▲ Its destructive power is so great that mankind may be conquered!

Germany

University Professor Dr. J. Andernack said before the European War that the gonococcus had spread all over the world and that mankind would be conquered by its destructive power. Therefore, he worked hard to study drugs for the treatment of gonorrhea. After repeated animal experiments, he invented a kind of membrane-permeable bactericide, named "MATHHEXN" Metol Kexing. Its medicinal power can penetrate the urethral mucosa and directly attack the nest of the diplococcus, completely eliminating new and old gonorrhea and preventing future troubles.

Germany

"Metol Kexing" has been popular all over the world for more than ten years. After clinical trials by famous doctors in various countries, it is considered to be the only special medicine for modern gonorrhea. Whether it is new or old gonorrhea, or severe complications of gonorrhea, those who have not been cured by various treatments can be cured with "German Metol Kexing" in a short time. After the disease is cured, the urine discharged by the patient is examined under a microscope, and the gonococcus disappears completely. It has been tested repeatedly and proven effective. From then on, the evil gonococcus has been conquered by Dr. J. Andernack, and human life has been protected by him.

Germany

"Metol Kexing" has been sold in China for a long time and is famous in the medical and pharmaceutical circles. Those who have knowledge know that it is the most authoritative medicine for the treatment of gonorrhea. Its membrane-permeable bactericidal power cannot be compared to any other gonorrhea medicine. Patients with gonorrhea can purchase it from pharmacies nearby and take it themselves for a quick cure. Its "Special Metol Kexing" has even stronger permeability. Its bactericidal, diuretic, and anti-inflammatory powers are even greater, so sales are even stronger.

### Postal Foreman Found Stealing Letters

Addiction to Gambling Causes Major Change in Behavior; Chen Zuji Has Admitted the Truth

Chen Zuji, a postal clerk from Guangdong at the Shanghai Post Office General Bureau on North Sichuan Road, has served at the bureau for thirteen years and earns a monthly salary of 120 yuan. He has been promoted to the position of state box foreman because of his hard work and diligence. Recently, the post office authorities heard rumors that Chen was addicted to Jai Alai, and merchants reported that they had not received many letters. Therefore, the authorities sent personnel to investigate secretly. Until noon the day before yesterday, Zheng Zhisan, secretary of the post office delivery department, and inspector Zhong Guangyao saw Chen Zuji carrying a package of paper, intending to go outside. Zheng and others suspected his behavior and asked what was in the package. Chen replied that it was dirty clothes. When they forced him to open it, it was full of letters, a total of ninety-one. They reported it to the Hongkou Police and ordered detectives to go and arrest Chen. Then, they went to Chen's home at No. 100 Tongfu Road and found twenty-four pairs of letters, which were also taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him for theft under Article 220 of the Criminal Code and Article 44 of the Postal Law. He stated that the defendant had stolen many letters and the police needed to investigate further. He requested a postponement of the case. The witnesses Zheng Zhisan and Zhong Guangyao also testified, proving everything. When questioned, the defendant Chen Zuji confessed to stealing letters, but denied gambling on Jai Alai, saying that because his family was large, his income was not enough to cover his expenses, so he stole letters to steal the postage stamps attached to them. Judge Ye Shengchao verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained and the hearing to be postponed for seven days.

### Rickshaw Owner Sued for Paternity Acknowledgment

Zheng Afu Requests Acknowledgment at the Local Court; Court Orders Forensic Examination

Zheng Changshan, a native of Jiangbei, is over fifty years old, and comes from a poor background. In recent years, he has opened a rickshaw company on Haichao Temple Road in Nanshi and accumulated wealth. Recently, Zheng Afu hired lawyer Zhou Yingcai and requested the local court to acknowledge Zheng Changshan as his biological father. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang questioned him. Zheng Afu stated that he was indeed Zheng Changshan's biological son. His biological mother, Zheng Sun, was driven out, and his father cohabitated with Xiong and refused to acknowledge his flesh and blood. He requested the court to order adoption, etc. Zheng Changshan flatly denied that Afu was his son. Zheng Sun stated that she was 58 years old, from Yangzhou. At the age of eighteen, she was betrothed to Zheng Changshan in her hometown and officially married at the age of twenty. Two months later, her husband accidentally injured someone and fled to Suzhou, where he worked as a foot massager in a bathhouse. He wrote a letter to me in Suzhou, and we cohabitated in Liujiabang. At the age of twenty-three, I gave birth to Afu. At the age of three, we came to Shanghai and lived in Lujiabang. At that time, we took in a goddaughter, Xiong. Unexpectedly, my husband became licentious and took Xiong as a concubine, forcing me and my mother back to our hometown. Now that Afu is an adult, he naturally wants to reunite with his flesh and blood. Zheng Changshan said that Sun was just someone with whom he had an affair and there was no child. Please examine Sun for verification. The court ordered Sun to be sent to the Forensic Institute for examination before the next hearing.

### Hotel Bed Reveals Dead Child

A Traveler from the Mountains Abandons the Child, Police Report and Forensic Examination Requested

At 4:45 PM yesterday, a male guest arrived at the Zhejiang Hengji Hotel, No. 25 Tongyun Street, west of Yanghang Street outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession. He wore a white short shirt and trousers, claimed to be Wang Fuan, 22 years old, from Jiangsu, spoke with a Shanghai accent, and stated he was a fish merchant seeking accommodation. A receptionist led him to room 110, costing 7 jiao per day, and he paid 1 yuan in legal tender. He then left, returning about five minutes later with a male and female guest. The male guest wore a green turned-down collar shirt and black trousers, was about twenty years old.

He went inside to check and saw a child sleeping on the bed, covered with a blanket. Two double-hao coins were placed on the blanket, which he found strange. He touched the child and found it was no longer breathing. He lifted the blanket and saw that the child had died. The body was cold.

### Ban on Showing Anti-Smuggling Slogans Due to Failure to Pass Inspection

Shanghai Municipal Council Explains the Reasons

The Shanghai Municipal Council’s ban on showing slogans against buying and selling smuggled goods has caused dissatisfaction from all walks of life. The Anti-Smuggling Association also believes that this case concerns the national character and has made representations to the council. The association has now received a reply from the council stating: "Regarding your letter of July 9, we have learned that the claim that our staff prohibited the screening of anti-smuggling slogans is incorrect. The police received information that the Guanghua Cinema on Avenue Edward VII was showing films that had not been approved by the Film Censorship Board according to the licensing regulations, and requested the cinema to explain the reasons. So far, Guanghua and other cinemas have not submitted these films for review. This is our reply."

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Four New Ships Named

Upper Yangtze Ships Named Ba River and Min River, Coastal Ships Named Huainan and Hainan

Three Rivers in the Upper Reaches The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to develop Yangtze River shipping to connect the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River for transportation and to restore river routes, specially built the Jinjiang ship to run on the Shanghai-Chongqing line. It also built two new-style steamships, each with a load of 400 tons, to operate on the Hankou-Yichang and Changsha routes. These two ships were also built by the Jiangnan Shipyard and are scheduled to be launched next month. The names of the two new ships have been drafted by the bureau and submitted to the ministry for instructions. Yesterday, instructions arrived in Shanghai stating that the names of the two new ships, as determined by the ministry, are (1) Ba River and (2) Min River. Together with the Jinjiang ship, which was launched on the 26th of last month, they will be the three rivers of the upper reaches. The ministry will send personnel to Shanghai to hold the naming ceremony when the two ships are launched next month.

Two Souths Overseas The bureau also purchased the Bailinan and Dieshi ships in the United States, preparing to send them on the South China and Southeast Asian island routes. The ships are already en route and are expected to arrive in China in late next month. The names of the two ships have been approved by the ministry, designating them as (1) Hainan and (2) Huainan. The naming ceremony has been agreed to be held when the Ba River and Min River are launched. It is reported that the Hainan will operate on international routes, and the Huainan will sail on the Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong routes.

### Yangtze River Alert: Yichang Water Level Surges

Similar to the Flood of the 20th Year, the Situation is Tense and Extremely Worrying

The water level in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has risen sharply again. This year's major flood season is about to begin, which is truly worrisome. The details are recorded as follows:

Yichang Water Level Surges

According to the Yichang water level report received by the Jianghai Customs today, the situation is extremely serious. The Yichang water level was only 16 feet 5 inches on the 13th of this month, rose to 27 feet 8 inches on the 16th, and rose to 37 feet 8 inches on the 18th. Yesterday, it rose to 44 feet. In one week, the water level rose sharply by 27 feet 5 inches, and the severity of the situation cannot be overstated.

The Situation in the Lower Reaches is Still Slow

According to yesterday's Yichang water level, it is similar to the major flood of the second year. Fortunately, the water levels in Hankou and other downstream areas are rising slowly, so the customs has not received reports of levee collapses. Yesterday's water level in Hankou was 34 feet 8 inches, Jiujiang was 35 feet 9 inches, Anqing was 34 feet 6 inches, Wuhu was 23 feet 3 inches, and Zhenjiang was 15 feet.

### Suspension of Eurasia Aviation Flights

It has recently been rumored that Eurasia Aviation has temporarily suspended the Beijing-Hong Kong and Beijing-Lanzhou routes. This report is inconsistent with the facts, as the Hong Kong-Taiyuan and Lanzhou-Suiyuan routes are still operating as usual. Only the Taiyuan-Beijing and Suiyuan-Beijing routes have been suspended due to the Lugouqiao Incident.

### Summer Special

The Fatty in Summer The curtain of time has lifted on the scorching sun, and most people stay indoors during the day, avoiding the sun that burns like fire. The powerful escape to famous mountains to avoid the heat, the wealthy enjoy air conditioning, and only the common laborers contend with the scorching sun. But although the scorching sun is fearsome, we are determined to fight it, and we don't feel much. It's truly distressing for a fat person to spend this hot summer. Their bodies are full of fat, their muscles tremble when they walk, they pant for breath, and they wave their fans all day long, yet sweat pours down their foreheads like rain. But someone who understands martial arts says: "Fat people become fat because they eat a lot and exercise little. If they could practice martial arts every day, their bodies would naturally be very strong." But the fat person is always unwilling to put in the effort!

Sleeping with a fat person in the summer has many advantages, because fat people are more afraid of the heat than skinny people. They keep waving their fans in bed, and the skinny person also gets the breeze without waving a fan. And the fat person's body is cold. Fat people don't get any advantages from others. They need more fabric to make clothes, and tailors charge more. They have difficulty moving, they have to pay extra for rickshaws, and they are left behind when getting on and off vehicles. No one pities them because they are fat and gives them a seat. It's even more unsightly for women to be fat, but no fat person doesn't want to lose weight. The best way to lose weight is to cheer up, do more labor, diligently practice martial arts, and abstain from fatty foods, to turn a fat body into an iron man, and to do their part in this extraordinary time for the country!

### Summer Night in the Lower Class

— Wei Jing

Although the fiery sun has gone to another continent to exert its power, the residual heat in the slums is enough to force every person who needs rest after excessive fatigue during the day to use what little energy they have left to move to the streets, receiving some of the cool of the night that doesn't cost a price to obtain.

The ice sellers, who have been struggling all day, still struggle with their already hoarse throats, selling in the crowd, dragging their heavy steps, struggling, and making a final effort in a life that has not yet met their needs. The sweat oozing from their skin, which is as dirty as can be, makes them look as if they have just crawled out of a small pond. The mood of the people cooling off is somewhat disturbed, but few people take out money to buy a little coolness.

The moon gradually moves from the east of the street to the west, gradually disappearing behind the houses. The laughter of the adults gradually subsides. The cries of the children gradually stop. Some of the people cooling off return to the fiery houses to spend the rest of the night. Some people bring their broken mats and tattered quilts, and fall asleep on the quieter sidewalks. At this time, under the dim street lights, one, two, unimaginable women gradually appear, secretly soliciting physical transactions from passersby. Bursts of teasing sounds sometimes disturb the good dreams of those sleeping in the open and cause curses.

It's the time when the movie theaters let out, it's the time when the dance halls close, it's the time when the air in the suburbs has been filtered by the night sea breeze and is very cool, and it's suitable for driving. At this time, streamlined cars with snub noses speed by silently. Snake-like women fall into the arms of pig-like gentlemen and rush to the suburbs to pursue the coolness of the second half of the night. These 1937-style cars, although they pass by without any noise, the dust stirred up often covers those sleeping in the open with an extra quilt with the summer night wind.

### Bathing in Nantai

— Lu Da

The arrival of summer makes people feel uncomfortable, so they go to the bathroom to take a refreshing bath. At this time, I can't help but think of the bathing situation in Nantai, my hometown of Rongcheng.

Bathing in Nantai is very convenient. The bathrooms are divided into common pools and private pools. The structure of the common pools is similar to that of the hot spring pools in general bathhouses, but the water is often changed and is relatively cleaner. The private pools are made of ceramic tiles, and the pool water is clear and the temperature is high. It is led by water pipes from hot springs four or five miles away, so it contains a lot of sulfur and is a good remedy for various skin diseases.

There are many hot springs here, from Tangbian Township in the northeast of the city to near Wangzhuang, covering an area of about six or seven miles. The temperature of the water is as high as 70 degrees Celsius, so there are many bathhouses in that area. The price of bathing is also relatively cheap. In bathhouses such as Shicao and Bajiaojing, it only costs sixteen copper coins (in Fuzhou, copper coins are called "pieces") to bathe once, so the men and women of Fuzhou have a habit of "water covering the skin" like the people of Nanjing, and they have to bathe every day to satisfy our "bathing addiction"!

In the past, there was a time when men and women bathed together. In the Baihe Company Mingyuan Bathhouse in the city, there were many modern men and women going to the bath together, but now, due to the intervention of the Public Security Bureau, men and women bathe separately.

### Ningbo Grass Mats

— Xiao

Summer has come to the world again. Summer is a hot and distressing season when the god of fire rages and the scorching sun shows its power! Humans can't stand its ruthless and fierce attacks, and everyone needs a "fan" to resist. Therefore, every year in the summer, the sales of fans are very wide and popular.

Ningbo, a land of abundance, is originally a "paradise" on earth, and its various edible local products are famous and well-known! Now, let's talk about "grass mat fans"!

Grass mat fans, as the name suggests, are of course woven from grass mats. These grass mat fans are almost all woven by women in rural villages, and they are one of the side businesses of women in rural villages in the summer.

Ningbo women are intelligent and lively, and they are also willing to work hard to study, so although grass mats are a very rough thing, only used for mats, after being woven by their skillful fingers, they are woven into a delicate and beautiful fan. The fans are painted with beautiful women, cranes, lotus flowers, and other pleasing animal and plant pictures, with realistic shapes and bright colors, and a bit of artistic meaning. And it is light and windy to carry, without any effort!

Speaking of prices, it couldn't be more economical! Each grass mat fan only sells for a dozen or twenty copper coins, because there are also high and low prices! In the past, grass mat fans were only available in Ningbo, and it was impossible to find them anywhere else. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the rural collapse, rural families, in order to increase their income, have transported grass mat fans in large quantities to other places, introducing Ningbo's unique inexpensive and high-quality handicrafts to various places, so that people in various places have the opportunity to buy and enjoy Ningbo grass mat fans, and their income every summer has increased a lot, which is really a "win-win" thing.

### It's Swimming Season

— Pei

——Review of Shanghai Swimming Pools——

The swimming season has arrived, and almost all public and private swimming pools in Shanghai are open. Here, I will make a rough review of the Shanghai swimming pools I know:

Speaking of swimming pools in Shanghai, the first one that should be recommended is of course the swimming pool in the city center. It is magnificent in scale, perfect in equipment, wide in pool, and there is a smaller pool specially for women and children who are learning to swim. Before entering the pool, there are shower heads and washing facilities, which are clean and hygienic, very particular, and the tickets are cheap, only two jiao in legal tender.

There are two swimming pools in Hongkou, one indoors and one outdoors, and the equipment is also very good, but the tickets are expensive, requiring five jiao in legal tender on Sundays and four jiao on weekdays. It is established by the Public Works Bureau. Its biggest drawback is that although clothes and other items can be handed over to the storage office for safekeeping, the rules state that it is not responsible for any losses. It is said to be storage, but it is not responsible for any losses, which I don't know what the reason is, it is really confusing.

There is a swimming pool in the Chinese YMCA on North Sichuan Road. The equipment is more for swimming than the Hongkou swimming pool, and it is only for the members of the association. During the summer vacation, summer members are recruited separately.

The Western YMCA across from the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road has a swimming pool. The equipment is quite good, but most of the swimmers are Westerners, and Chinese are rarely seen.

The swimming pool of the Jué Dū Ballroom on Met Hust Road has a small pool and luxurious decorations. The ticket price last year was one yuan, but now it has been changed to five jiao. It was originally a private swimming pool.

The Lanyuan swimming pool on Maisi'ai Road is not large in pool and the equipment is not very good. The pool water is sometimes very dirty. There are many Russians. The ticket price is four jiao. There is also a tennis court in front of the pool.

There are natural swimming places on the coast of Minhang, Gaoqiao, Wusong, etc. The best in terms of equipment is Gaoqiao. The ticket price is one jiao, but it can be used to pay for food at the stall, which is actually equivalent to not selling tickets. This method is very good, and it can restrict people who are not interested in swimming from entering, but the food at the stall is too expensive, and it costs one jiao to eat a bowl of cold steamed water.

In addition, there are private swimming pools such as the Diàoxìndé family pool, Mùshèng pool, and group swimming pools such as the Youyou pool. The schools have Southeast Sports College, East Asia Sports College, Jiaotong University, Shanghai Industrial College, and Qingxin and Liangjiang. The equipment is best at Jiaotong University.

### Today's Hangzhou Fan Industry

— Yafei

Speaking of fans, everyone will think of Hangzhou, the fan production base! Because Hangzhou is not only the scenery of West Lake that makes people linger, but its local products are also really lovely. For example, silk, lotus root powder, scissors, tea, and pickles are all Hangzhou's specialties, and they are all famous all over the world. Fans are also one of Hangzhou's specialties, and their history is also very long.

The gathering places for manufacturing fans are in Guanxiang, Taipingfang, and Fanzi Lane in the city of Hangzhou. In particular, Fanzi Lane is named after fans, and there are the most fan-making workshops there.

There are many kinds of fans, but the most commonly known are folding fans, round fans, silk fans, feather fans, cattail fans, and banana leaf fans. However, the most famous of the Hangzhou fans is the folding fan, which is not only exquisite and beautiful in style, but also very ancient and interesting. Among the folding fans, there are also white paper, black oiled paper, and red oiled paper. White paper folding fans are mostly used by literati and elegant scholars, while black oiled paper fans are used by the working class. As for red oiled paper fans, because many big-headed ghosts and small-headed ghosts, or white impermanence and black impermanence, are often painted on the fan surface with colored powder, they feel that they look good.

Exquisite white paper folding fans, in addition to the calligraphy and painting of celebrities on the fan surface, the fan bones must also be polished and carved to increase their value. However, art lovers also love to use gold paint to depict figures or characters on black oiled paper fans.

The second is the silk fan, which is mostly round in style, and its popularity has been quite long. The ancient poems "Round fans are only afraid of the white dew autumn" and "Light silk small fans pat fireflies" refer to this fan.

Originally, Zhejiang Province was a region that produced silk and damask, especially Hangzhou, where the silk spring, Hangzhou silk, and cooked silk produced were already well-known, so the silk fans produced were also very famous. As for feather fans and seagull copper fans, they are all made of the feathers of birds, such as peacock feathers, goose feathers, swallow feathers, pheasant feathers, goose feathers, seagull feathers, etc., which are all materials for making fans. Cattail fans are woven from the stems of cattails after drying, but their prices are cheap and not very practical. Cattails are produced in wet areas such as ponds and ditches, and the price is very wide. The banana leaves of banana leaf fans, except for a small part produced in Zhejiang Province, mostly come from Fujian and Guangdong. These fans also come in two types, thick and thin, and the thick ones must be further divided into large and small, the large ones are called ox hearts, and the small ones are called goose hearts, and they are woven in two shapes: peach and round.

As for the price of folding fans, the price of silk folding fans is at least one yuan or more per fan, and paper ones range from one jiao to more than one yuan per fan. The wooden bones of feather fans are exquisitely carved, and the feathers are brightly colored and precious, and each handle is even worth forty or fifty yuan, while the dyed feather folding fans also cost four or five yuan to more than ten yuan each.

In recent years, since electric fans have become popular at low prices, the business of folding fans and feather fans has been greatly affected, and the Hangzhou fan market has also declined. The high-priced ones are almost unsalable in the country, and there are only a few sales abroad. There are more than 20 fan shops in Hangzhou with a relatively large scale, among which Shulianji has the largest scope, Zhang Ziyuan has the oldest brand, and Wang Xingji has the most varieties of colors.

The total amount of Hangzhou fan business is about 200,000 yuan per year, but the business is most prosperous in the summer, and the other three seasons of spring, autumn, and winter are in a state of closure. And fan shops and fan merchants in various ports mostly send personnel to Hangzhou to wholesale in the early summer, and some are transported overseas by foreign firms.

### The Mated Luan and Phoenix

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Episode 16 (News from Afar, Yu Nan's Window Speaks of Dreams, Romantic Resignation from the Gathering, A Carriage Turns Back in the Brothel Alley)

Youmei twisted her body at his words, and lowered her head, unable to continue speaking. Guoqì poured a cup of tea, held it with both hands, and handed it to Youmei, smiling: Are you very free now? Saying that, he still retreated and sat on the chair opposite her. He couldn't help but look at Youmei's face. Youmei first picked up the cup and held it higher than the tip of her nose, with a bit of a covering meaning. But before long, she put down the teacup and immediately straightened her expression. She said: As a student, there is no such thing as being busy or not, it all depends on how diligent or lazy you are. If you want to be lazy, you have free time every day. Guoqì said: But you are not a lazy person. Youmei didn't say anything, but smiled slightly. Guoqì said: You came this morning, there must be something you want to teach me, right? Youmei looked at the door and window, picked up the teacup in her hand, took a sip, and shot a glance at Guoqì from the edge of the teacup, sipping the tea with a smile. Guoqì said: Indeed, if you have something to teach me, just say it clearly. Youmei said in a low voice: Why are the novels that cousin published in the magazine written so mournfully? When I saw them, I really felt sad. Guoqì smiled: Then don't blame me for making harsh criticisms of you. A person like you, who has been washed by civilization, shouldn't make the mistake of crying while listening to storytelling and worrying about the ancients. Youmei said: It's not that I cried after reading your great work. To tell you the truth, I'm almost a person of dead ashes and withered wood, and it's impossible for me to be saddened by ordinary words. Cousin must have said, if you are not moved, why are you saying this? You need to know that I'm saying this for others. When Guoqì heard this, his heart moved, and his face naturally changed. Youmei smiled slightly: Regarding this matter, cousin can always know, there's no need for me to say it in detail, right? Guoqì said: Of course I know. Since she has had a place to belong, I haven't heard a single piece of news. I wrote this novel just out of a sudden impulse, writing it like this, I didn't expect it to cause others to be unhappy. Youmei said: Others don't cry, but people who are in the same boat, wouldn't they cry when they see this kind of writing? Guoqì said: I didn't go into that. Miss Li suddenly mentioned this matter, it must have been when she saw him crying while reading in person, right? Youmei said: Although he and I are very good friends, the place he lives in is a strange place, and it's hard to say whether it's like the previous place, where I can go and play casually. So until now, I haven't been there. But he didn't forget his old friends, and came to my house in person to talk to me. It was really like a girl going back to her mother's house, reluctant to leave, and didn't go home until after 9:00 at night. Guoqì said: Was it still that night? (198)

Talk

### Stop Negotiating

— Parker

So-called negotiation uses language and writing to resolve all disputes between parties; therefore, negotiation is only a means, not a necessary condition for resolving disputes. What naturally lies behind negotiation is strength. Unless one party yields to the strength of the other and compromises, there is no basis for negotiation at all.

The relationship between China and Japan is now very clear. Japanese soldiers are rampaging in the Pingjin area of Chinese territory in a steady stream, and they have inhumanely strafed the Pinghan train from airplanes. Under the consistent policy of inciting traitors in various places, their vicious tactics are constantly being implemented against us. However, our military officers, who bear the front line of national defense, are hesitant and indecisive. Surrounded by a large number of traitors, they still want to negotiate with the Japanese army. We are not opposed to negotiations that do not cede rights and humiliate the nation. But if you say that China and Japan can negotiate without ceding rights and humiliating the nation, even children will not believe it. Moreover, in this kind of negotiation, Japan can threaten with a large army on the one hand and calmly arrange things on the other. Our soldiers, although they are said to be loyal and brave for the country, cannot avoid having their "courage" of "striking at the first drum" somewhat dampened under the indecisiveness of their commanders.

Now the commander is surrounded by the honeyed words of traitors and enveloped in an atmosphere of negotiation. The fact is very clear: if the negotiation succeeds, China will be forever in a state of utter ruin. At the same time, General Song's heroic reputation for resisting the enemy will also be lost along with the country's sovereignty and territory. General Song's current situation is complicated, but if we focus on the big picture and take the country's interests as the premise, it seems like a "battle with one's back to the river," where one can only survive by fighting to the death. The question is whether General Song is willing to make a decision. In our opinion, General Song has the support of the central government above him, the willingness of his soldiers to fight below him, and so many people who are willing to pledge their support as a national shield. He can not only "respond" to the battle, but also "decide" the battle; he can not only "resist" the enemy, but also "annihilate" the enemy. If he lightly gives up this great opportunity to serve the country, then we must say bluntly that this is simply courting death.

A telegram sent by five groups, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association, to General Song said it most thoroughly. It said that there is no compromise now, and compromise is just another name for humiliation (paraphrased). Because the fact is very clear, China has compromised with Japan several times, and has lost its rights and humiliated the nation several times. Compromise can never lead to survival; only resistance is the way to live. The reason why we support General Song and the soldiers of the 29th Army is only because they can fight. Under the current situation, responding to the battle is no longer our active strategy. In terms of the odds of winning, "responding" to the battle is not as good as "initiating" the battle. We are being deceived by the smoke screen of peace, allowing them to transport troops and equipment into our territory to slaughter us. The famous Soviet saying "strike the striker" is well said: "We must not only strike them within our territory, but also fight them within their own territory!"

China's current position is like this: without striking the striker, there will never be true peace. Although we do not want to use Pingjin as a battlefield, we will not hesitate to do so until the enemy is driven out of the country. General Song bears the responsibility of defending the territory and is at the forefront. His responsibility is naturally greater than that of ordinary generals. We comfort General Song, and we solemnly tell General Song that now is definitely not the time to bring Chen Juesheng, Qi Chuyuan, and others to visit Xiangtian to negotiate peace. What is the use of negotiation? The people of the country all say "fight!"

### Song of Slaves

— Fang Hei

Forever a humble slave, you, head bowed, face pale, only knowing how to beg for pity, living in a corner of the world, basely sharing some sunlight, a little ration; but you are not living for yourself, a prisoner's chain forever weighing on your ankles.

You have lost yourself, but the enemy has already made himself your master.

Even if someone slaps your cheeks, spits on your forehead, you always endure humiliation, swallow your anger, you dare not be angry at all, dare not grind your teeth, glare your eyes. Sometimes, you also want to shout, but the shout turns into a weak sigh when it reaches your lips.

You are timid, but why are you timid?

You also try to stand up, stand on your own feet and be a human being, but why do you fall down again, hand dragging your head, clutching your chest? Forever a slave, you, living for humiliation, for slaughter, for shame.

Arise, slaves, stand on your own feet and walk, and throw away your hands to shoulder the ambition that a person should have. Remember: you are living for yourself, you have to restore the self that has been deprived, do not always hang your head, pale your face. Slaves, resist, take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and be the masters of your own land.

Calendars printed with scarlet blood are torn off one after another, adding new bloodstains to the scarlet bloodstains. The days are pale, and under the gloomy sky, no one can breathe. "Today in a certain year..." Speeches starting like this are mostly tragic stories, stories of bloodshed.

You cannot be a permanent slave. Think of those palms that once slapped your cheeks, those whips that lashed you, those sharp blades that once cut off your body, those humiliations that you have all endured. You should fight back. Yes, you have fought back, and you have also obtained a temporary piece of glory; but you have lost your ambition again, and you have fallen down again, hand clutching your head, clutching your chest, not even gritting your teeth.

Now arise, slave, the time has come. The guns of freedom fighters have already aimed at your chest, you must be the master of your own land, rise up to resist, for self-defense and for revenge.

Let us make one last resistance, shed the last drop of blood, and let our defense of the territory be our glorious tomb.

"People who refuse to be slaves, let's build our new Great Wall with our flesh and blood..." The same song of shouting rises again;... I seemed to have seen a pen drawing on the cover of a magazine, drawing a leg stretching straight, seemingly a manifestation of strength.

### Water Country

— Kang Li

The weather starts to act up in May, half rain, half sunny, sometimes the sun is even mixed with rain, the gentlemen lying in the high-rise lobbies only feel listless, and eat more ice cream, while the farmers in the fields patrol the dikes day and night with trepidation, praying in the temples, hoping that the weather will clear up soon.

My hometown is by Dongting Lake. From a young age, my heart was filled with the fear of water. Whenever it rained, the adults said worriedly, "Flooding weather! Flooding weather!" I would dream of floods coming, the roofs floating on the water, small snakes living on the tops of trees, drowned people, their bellies swollen like water buffalo, and when the big waves rolled in, there would be many red lacquer furniture, black leather suitcases, and things like white gauze curtains and red flower clothes. Sometimes, many big poisonous insects and big ants would drill into the trouser legs of the corpses, scaring me to cry and wake up from my dream.

"How many inches did the river rise last night? How many inches did the lake rise last night?" Everyone ran around in the rain asking. If it rained for three days in a row, the families who planted "low fields" would not have to say anything. They would quickly wrap up dry food, cook the chickens and ducks, eat a big meal, and then pile up the big door, the door of the room, the door of the kitchen, and the bed frame to form a big "raft" to escape for their lives. Tears had long been cried dry, and there was only a soft sigh, "Heavenly Lord, save us! If you want us to die, let us die on dry land before we close our eyes!" Even more fatalistic people did not dare to complain about the heavens, only hating that "fate should be so!" They would tie a long hemp rope tightly around the waists of their families, so that the flood would come and they could die together without being scattered, which was their only hope of great luck in misfortune.

Sometimes the river water would rise sharply, and the lake water would be backflowed by the river water, dyeing it red. Coupled with a few days of rain, washing down the yellow mud in the mountains, scouring the red soil on both banks, and rolling up the half-ripe yellow rice, it was truly mighty and vast, with red light for thousands of miles. If an art appreciator saw it, they would definitely call it "God's masterpiece." Whenever I came to such a time, I would often sit alone on the top of the mountain, so that the miserable cries would not enter my ears, but my eyes could still see this beautiful picture dyed with blood, the thatched cottage like a duck in the water, things floating in the wind. Yangliu Village turned into aquatic plants, floating in the water in clumps. The people who had not died were like swimming fish playing in the duckweed. There were very few boats coming and going, only "rafts" like wild geese swaying in the waves. Sometimes a big wave would break them up, and the people on the "raft" would be taken away by the waves. Sometimes the "raft" would row close to the woods. A group of people like wild beasts would squeeze up on it, and the "raft" could not withstand such a large pressure, so it had to roll over in the water, and the people would fall into the water to become dinner for fish and turtles.

When the flood came, human life was lighter than a fish or shrimp, and corpses were swollen into piles, and no one dared to look at them. Sometimes a backwater bay would accumulate hundreds of corpses, and tens of thousands of crows would fly to have a big banquet, and wild dogs would also swim in groups to eat as much as they could chew, making the corpse meat a mess. The most interesting thing was that the crows would peck the human intestines and fly all over the sky, fighting with each other, turning the gray sky into a battlefield with banners flying and spears like forests.

I have been through seven major floods and have not died, which can be considered "Heaven gave me special favor." Now that I live in this high-rise building in Shanghai, there is no danger of drowning, but whenever it rains heavily, terror still strikes in waves, as if someone is shouting: "The lake water has risen sharply, the river water has risen five inches overnight!" Then the old mother tremblingly says: "Child! Put the boat down into the water earlier, move the important things onto the boat quickly, don't be like your uncle's family last year..." Ah, this is so heartbreaking! I can't bear to think about it anymore, I only hope that the Heavenly Lord will open his eyes and not put disasters on the poor farmers alone.

The rain is getting heavier, this must be "flooding weather! flooding weather!" Soon there will be bad news spreading all over the country, I think.

### Please Accept the Enthusiasm of the People

— Xing An

As soon as the news of the front-line resistance spread, the national spirit was stirred up, and patriotic compatriots volunteered to donate money to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers. This not only shows the progress of national consciousness, but also shows the determination of the people to fight against the enemy with one heart. However, it is extremely disappointing that this enthusiasm of the people across the country cannot be accepted by the highest-ranking generals on the front lines! Even the fundraising activities of all walks of life in Ping City were considered "although the intention is commendable, it inevitably hinders traffic," and could not be carried out. The reason for declining donations to comfort the troops was that "this incident is only a local conflict, and there are few casualties. Moreover, the country has been raising soldiers for a thousand days to use them for a moment. It is the duty of soldiers to serve on the frontier."

Considering the Lugou Bridge Incident as "only a local conflict" is enough to admire the calmness of the authorities. Unfortunately, the facts are hard to reassure people: "A total of more than 8,000 Japanese troops have gathered between Fengtai and Tongzhou. The commander of the Kawaguchi 10th Division and the commander of the Kawabe Brigade are currently in Fengtong, and the encirclement of Ping City has been completed." Also, according to reliable information: "The Japanese government has recently detained 31 merchant ships, loaded with a large number of troops and munitions, coming to our country. Five divisions, the 5th, 6th, 10th, 12th, and 16th, have been ordered to depart, with a total of about 100,000 people. Among them, in addition to two divisions that have been designated to go to Pingjin, the remaining three divisions will temporarily go to Korea to stand by, and are scheduled to complete the transfer within a week. In addition, the Japanese reserve troops stationed in Korea and other places have also been ordered to prepare." Such a small local conflict, and the Japanese are deploying troops and generals in this way, can be said to be a fool's errand.

Declining donations to comfort the troops is still a minor matter. What is more noteworthy is the progress of peace talks. In recent days, it has been rumored that the North China authorities will accommodate the Japanese demands. But regarding this matter, it is said that "there are demands, but we will never admit them. There is no agreement yet, and there is no loss of national sovereignty." If this is really the case, it is reassuring. However, the people of the country have been taught too deeply by the past. This incident is so serious, how can the Japanese not take the opportunity to advance? According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman: "Talks between the North China Garrison and the Hebei-Chahar authorities are still in progress. The Hebei-Chahar cadres are still sincere. What is being discussed now is the details based on the agreement." I wonder to what extent the North China authorities are sincere? International negotiations naturally value sincerity. However, being too sincere with ambitious people may be a bit dangerous!

In recent days, all parties have sent telegrams to encourage the front-line generals, taking the spirit of fighting for the nation's righteousness. Overseas Chinese have also sent telegrams requesting resistance to defend the country. And many enthusiastic people are still donating money enthusiastically. However, it is worrying that the people in the rear want to come out to help, but the highest-ranking generals on the front lines are unwilling to accept it, which is a bit embarrassing. Fortunately, the people's donations are voluntary, out of patriotic enthusiasm, and will not be discouraged by being rejected. Comforting the loyal and brave soldiers is the obligation of fellow countrymen. The front-line soldiers are fighting the enemy in blood. Shouldn't the people of the country give them some comfort?

### "Lord's Ship"

— Tian Qing

Under the scorching sun of July, there is a desolation like that of an autumn night.

There is no desolation of the west wind, no groaning of fallen leaves; what replaces them are people's crying and the flying ashes of ghost money, circling in the sky.

Pneumonic plague, Black Death - this ferocious demon king, stepped over every family's roof ridge, broke into every family's empty courtyard, harming human health, and seizing the lives of livestock.

Thick black coffins, and thin coffins without paint, flash before people's eyes like shuttles. The crying is more miserable and complicated than the chirping of insects on an autumn night. Pigs are lazy in the pen, with purple spots on their bodies, and do not feel the smell of feed at all: the owner secretly discusses with the butcher in worry, and sells them at half price. The cat loses its prestige in front of the mouse, and the owner hangs a handful of ghost money on the tree. (There is a superstition in the countryside that dead cats are hung on trees, and the mice can no longer muster the courage to dig walls and roofs, quietly rotting in the wall holes and on the roofs, allowing insects and maggots to erode them.

What kind of world has this become, with people and animals suffering together?

A rumor flies everywhere like wingless poplar flowers - "The Lord's Ship" drags down the fields for three li, and the god's palanquin resides on the eastern enemy tower. The Lord goes on patrol every year to investigate human good and evil, no wonder so many wronged souls are being caught for trial.

Why does the trial of wronged souls also include livestock?

Livestock may have been people in their previous lives. If anyone doesn't believe it, please look at the early rice in the three li of fields, all lying down in a continuous line.

Conclusive evidence makes even those who are unwilling to believe the rumors become suspicious. So the Taoists are busy, the monks are busy, and even the little monks are putting on cassocks to make up the numbers; banquets are set up and rituals are performed in the surrounding villages and societies, and naturally there are plays to be performed: on the one hand, praying for the blessing of the Bodhisattva; on the other hand, catering to the interests of the Lord, so that he indulges in enjoyment and forgets the task of handling cases.

Under the scorching sun, everyone sincerely burns incense and makes vows, and also crowds together to watch the banquets and watch the plays. The scene is even more lively than the Lantern Festival. However, this kind of superficial liveliness does not have any cheerful and enthusiastic elements, and everyone's heart is hiding a touch of desolation.

Someone under the stage is spitting red saliva (this is also a kind of acute infectious disease) and is taken back by his companion. Everyone says that this person must have committed a crime in front of the Bodhisattva: some people also say that he was found out by the Lord for his sins in his previous life.

The death of people and the death of livestock are becoming more and more lively with the liveliness of the rituals, and even the coffins are feeling panic. The sound of crying fills the sky, covering up all the laughter and covering up the noise of the gongs and drums on the ritual and stage. Death is like a shadow, closely following behind everyone, and everyone's heart feels suffocated, feels the threat of death, and the atmosphere of panic increases in intensity with the passage of time. Faith in the Bodhisattva has also wavered. A group of people, however, declared that this was a sign that the period for handling cases had expired, and the Lord was about to depart, perhaps the Lord's trip was by land, so he ordered "corvée labor", perhaps these many people were all named in the Lord's files and should be tried.

The Taoists came up with a better idea, teaching people that the banquets should be made more sumptuous and the plays should be performed more lively, so that the Lord's servants would also forget the task of corvée labor; guaranteeing that after three days, the Lord would depart and everything would be peaceful, and the sick could be cured without medicine.

Many people who were unwilling to wait for death understood the horror of the expansion of this situation; they asked the epidemic prevention team to come out and give the people enlightenment through practice, and use knowledge to unravel the psychology of the people who were tightly entangled by superstition. But the captain of the epidemic prevention team was also sick, and there were no vaccines for epidemic prevention injections in the epidemic prevention institute, nor were there any medicines for treating epidemics: several team members were nervously learning to make gas masks, afraid that others would transmit the germs of the epidemic to them.

The Baojia head came back from a trial and immediately spread an unexpected message: "Seeking gods and being superstitious is detrimental to the national spirit: those who watch are like walls, there is mutual transmission of disease, the air is turbid, and public health is hindered, and should be strictly prohibited immediately: those who deliberately violate will be investigated."

A wave of injustice is rising in people's hearts: should people just wait for death in vain?

No, people should have the desire to live, and cannot wait for death in vain.

But apart from superstition, who will save them from the ferocity of death?

### Notes on Painting and Calligraphy

The famous painter Cai Heting, owner of the Di Lu He studio, is intelligent by nature, knowledgeable, deeply understands the mysteries of the Six Canons, and has been taught by famous teachers. His Chinese paintings, even on small pieces of paper and silk, have long been regarded as treasures and have become famous in the art world for more than a day. However, in order to seek further study, Cai has traveled extensively to famous mountains and rivers, experienced hardships, and tasted hardships in order to explore. I have learned that Cai visited friends in Shanghai the other day, staying at the home of Yuan Weixing, a stage designer at the Great Stage. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a while. For a time, those who asked him to paint were constantly coming and going, and the orders were overflowing. Although the weather was hot, Cai still wrote and painted while sweating, with absolutely no perfunctory attitude, which is truly commendable. Therefore, in recent days, the number of people asking for paintings has been even more enthusiastic, which is also good news for the world of calligraphy and painting.

The joint painting exhibition to comfort the front-line generals, sponsored by three painters, Shen Yiqian, Zhang Wenyuan, and Yu Chuangshuo, has been attracting a lot of viewers since its opening on the fourth floor of the Great New Company on the 17th. The details have been recorded in the local newspapers. Among the more than 700 items produced by the association, all are based on the actual writing and sharp satire cartoons in the Hebei-Chahar area of North China, which is different from the general pure art exhibitions. The contents include Zhang Wenyuan's "Red Land Thousands of Miles" map, the long scroll "Hell on Earth," Shen Yiqian's hundreds of realistic sketches of North China and knights going to the enemy, Cha Bei's uniquely independent horse groups, etc., and Yu Chuangshuo's hundreds of photos of Hebei-Chahar, such as Beiping Kunming, lakeside, and the 29th Army's combat exercises and life sketches, which are dazzling and beautiful. It is said that the exhibition will last for six days. Those who love art and pay attention to the North China issue, please do not miss it. Correspondence address: No. 7, Lane 366, Beikaier Road, Shanghai.

### Entertainment

Today (Tuesday) afternoon, if the weather is clear, the Municipal Council Orchestra will play brass music in the Bund Park from 5:30 onwards. The program includes seven items such as selected pieces, marches, and Spanish night songs. Listeners who rent cloth chairs will be charged 20 cents per chair, otherwise it is free.
