### Failed Attempt to Cross Zhoujia Bridge; Enemy Attacked Southward Along Zhenbei Road and Was Repelled

Fierce Fighting at Huangxia Residence; Our Troops Charged Out of Trenches and Inflicted Heavy Casualties on the Enemy. We Continue to Defend Xiaonanxiang; Enemy Attacks Were Unsuccessful. Enemy Shelling of Toyota Mill; Stray Bullets Killed Four British Soldiers.

The focus of the Shanghai battle has shifted westward. For the past two days, the enemy has been continuously bombing the northern bank of the Suzhou River, including Beixinjing, Huacao Town, and the area from Qiujiang West to Jiangqiao and Xiaonanxiang, with airplanes and heavy artillery. In the areas of Fanwangdu and Zhoujia Bridge, the two armies are confronting each other across the river, and the fighting is fierce. At 7 PM the night before, the enemy launched an attack from the Great China University, assaulting our Zhoujia Bridge. Both sides exchanged heavy artillery fire. By late evening at 11 PM, about four to five hundred enemy soldiers attempted to cross the river in the area of Zhongshan Road. Our troops immediately countered with machine gun fire, the bullets as dense as rain. The enemy found no opportunity to exploit and quietly retreated. Yesterday, the two sides exchanged fire across the river all day, the sound of gunfire and artillery clearly audible. The enemy's attempts to cross the river stealthily are unlikely to succeed. As for the enemy in the Zhenru area, they attacked southward along Zhenbei Road, holding positions at Panjia Residence, Jijia Warehouse, Qijia Village, and other locations on the north bank, confronting us. Our troops also formed a line on the north bank, with their backs to the river, occupying Huangjia Residence to the west of Zhenbei Road and Majia Residence, Xiajia Residence, Jinjia Residence, and other locations to the east of Zhenbei Road, constructing solid defensive positions. At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy advanced with two regiments. We launched three fierce counterattacks, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers and routing them. The enemy and we are currently still in a standoff, with a distance of less than one thousand meters between us. The enemy on the Zhongshan Road side, starting at 1 PM yesterday afternoon, bombarded our positions on the southern bank of the Suzhou River with dense artillery fire. The Toyota Mill was one of the enemy's targets. We also returned fire. For a time, the roaring sound shook western Shanghai. It did not stop until late evening. Many enemy shells landed in the extraterritorial road construction area of Brenan Road. Four British defense soldiers were killed by stray bullets, and two were injured. Nearby residents also suffered casualties. However, the damage to our military positions was minimal.

### Our Army's New Defensive Positions Are Exceptionally Solid

From Xiaonanxiang via Jiangqiao to Fanwangdu, the Defenses on the South Bank of the Suzhou River Are Particularly Strong.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 8:05 PM on the 29th that the front lines on both sides of the Suzhou River from Nanxiang have been arranged. From Xiaonanxiang, going southeast at Wujiafen, it crosses the Datong-Nanxiang Highway, then to Luoyang Bridge, along a section of the Zhenru-Nanxiang Highway, and then southwest, crossing the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway, passing through Jiangqiao Town, and then in a straight line south along the west bank of the Shenji Creek, reaching Yaojiadu on the north bank of the Suzhou River and Yaojia Residence on the south bank, mutually supporting each other and blocking the river. It then continues southeast along the south bank of the Suzhou River to Beixinjing and then to Fanwangdu. The fortifications along the river on the south bank are particularly solid. The enemy has been bombing with airplanes and heavy artillery for days, but there has been no damage. There have been no changes in the positions north of Xiaonanxiang.

The Central News Agency reports that after the enemy troops occupied Zhabei and Datong, they feared an ambush by our troops. Therefore, they advanced westward along the western line of Zhongshan Road and Jiaotong Road, one route going directly to the Suzhou River via Great China University. However, the bridges have been cut, preventing them from crossing. Another route went through Zhenru and reached Zhoujia Bridge Town on the north bank, confronting our troops across the river. The Qiujiang River to the west is still being defended by our troops, forming a solid front line with Jiangqiao. Xiaonanxiang and Guangfu are still firmly held by our troops. In the Luodian area, our positions at Shi Xiangong Temple and Cao Wang Temple are exceptionally solid. However, for the sake of adjusting the defensive line, they have been slightly shifted westward automatically. The previous reports that they had retreated to Dengqiao Town are now known to be inaccurate. The line north to Liu River is unusually quiet. A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 8:05 PM on the 29th that the enemy on the north bank of the Suzhou River west of the concession was active and very busy throughout the day. In the northeast of Caojiadu in the morning, there was a movement of enemy troops. In the afternoon, near the Rihua Mill, there were more than fifty enemy plainclothes personnel, coming and going to spy. A unit stationed at Great China University was busy constructing fortifications. An observation post was set up on the roof of the school. Artillery positions were also deployed near the school. In the afternoon, in the Tanzhi Bay area, an enemy balloon was raised to observe our military positions and then landed shortly thereafter.

The Central News Agency reports that our agency's war correspondent reported at 8:05 PM on the 29th that starting this morning, the enemy bombarded our military positions west of the Toyota Mill on the south bank of the Suzhou River with heavy artillery, concentrating especially on Huacao Town. Enemy aircraft also came back and forth to scout and drop bombs. It was a bit quieter in the afternoon. However, at 4:30 PM, the artillery fire started again. The Toyota Mill was hit by a shell and caught fire, which had not been extinguished as of the time of the report.

### Two Enemy Stealth Crossing Attempts Were Repelled; Fierce Fighting at Huangjia and Xiajia Residences

Enemy Dead and Wounded Littered the Ground; Fighting Did Not Stop Until Midnight.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 8:05 PM on the 29th that the enemy army moved south from Zhenru along Zhenbei Road and then advanced westward along the north bank of the Suzhou River, operating in areas such as Lujia Warehouse, Jinjia Residence, Houjia Mound, and Xi'antou, and constructing fortifications along the north bank of the river and the east bank of Xibin. Xibin is parallel to Shenji Creek, with the narrowest distance about half a kilometer. At dawn today, three small boats were discovered in the Xi'antou area, fully loaded with enemy troops attempting to cross the river stealthily at Xibin. Our troops immediately launched a fierce attack with machine guns and hand grenades, immediately sinking two of them. Enemy soldiers tried to escape by swimming, but our troops took aim and killed many of them. The remaining boat, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately turned its rudder and fled. In the afternoon, across from Beixinjing, there was an enemy motorboat loaded with enemy soldiers, also attempting to cross the river stealthily, which was also repelled by our troops. At the same time, enemy troops on the opposite bank opened fire with small artillery and machine guns, exchanging fire for a long time. The fighting gradually intensified in the evening. Our troops have been on high alert and are determined not to let them cross.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:00 AM on the 29th that starting at 5:00 PM this afternoon, the enemy army bombarded the Huangjia Residence and Xiajia Residence area on the north bank of the Suzhou River with mortars, with great intensity. At around 7:00 PM, the enemy army charged our positions. Our troops also came out of the trenches to meet them. The enemy dead and wounded littered the ground. The fierce fighting did not stop until midnight.

### Enemy Troops Attacked Xiaonanxiang Twice Yesterday

After Our Fierce Counterattack, the Enemy Suffered 800 Casualties.

The Central News Agency reports that our agency's correspondent reported at 12:00 AM on the 29th that after our troops retreated to the new front lines, the enemy continuously attacked our Xiaonanxiang positions. The two sides fought fiercely more than ten times. However, our troops have always held the area. Yesterday morning, the enemy attacked our positions with more than a brigade. After our brave resistance and five hours of bloody fighting, the enemy was repelled. At 4:30 PM in the afternoon, the enemy came to attack again with reinforcements. We immediately returned fire with fierce artillery fire and engaged in a bayonet charge. The fighting continued until midnight. In total, the enemy casualties were over 800. After this heavy blow, the enemy has shown signs of wavering.

### Enemy Shelling of Toyota Mill; Stray Bullets Killed British Soldiers

Four Killed, Two Wounded; Many Innocent Residents Died.

Yesterday afternoon, the enemy troops entrenched on the north bank of the Suzhou River in western Shanghai continuously shelled our army positions at the Toyota Mill on the south bank of the river. Stray bullets flew in the extraterritorial road construction area, such as Brenan Road and Great Western Road, with as many as fourteen shells landing. The above-mentioned areas are garrisoned by British troops. Around 6:00 PM in the evening, the shelling intensified. Two shells landed next to the Suzhou River on Great Western Road, killing three British soldiers on the spot and wounding two others. A total of eight nearby residents were killed by bullets. Another shell landed inside No. 1475 Yu Yuan Road, seriously wounding one British soldier, who soon died. Two Chinese were killed and wounded British soldiers were sent to Hong En Hospital for treatment. They are expected to recover soon. At the same time, five men and two women near Zhaofeng Garden were injured by artillery shells and were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, six shells landed in the Caojiadu Triangle Field in western Shanghai, killing one person and injuring fourteen. The injured were sent to Shi En Hospital by the rescue team for treatment. Their names are as follows: Zhang Genrong, 25 years old; Wu Anru, 37 years old; Wu Gendi, 25 years old; Zhou Zhangshi, 30 years old; Gu An'an, 23 years old; Zhang Linsheng, 20 years old; Peng Lushi, 44 years old; Zhang Amao, 35 years old; Chen Heshang, 25 years old; Lu Guiru, 16 years old; Wan Bo'fu, 30 years old; Yang Rugen, 26 years old, etc. A small steel artillery shell suddenly fell from the sky near the Columbia Road West Flag General Assembly on the Da West Road, which was built by Wanxi beyond the boundary, but fortunately, no one was passing by at the time, and no injuries were reported. Also, in Hejiajiao, Zhongshan Road, at about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a stray bullet flew and landed in the field next to Yangcun Elementary School and did not explode.

### Enemy Armed Motorboats Actually Sailed into the Suzhou River Yesterday

Attempting to Attack Our Troops, but Were Repelled by British Troops.

Two enemy armed motorboats, fully loaded with naval marines, sailed into the Suzhou River from the Huangpu River at 3:30 PM yesterday, attempting to sail west. When passing the Old Zha Bridge, they were stopped by British troops. The two sides confronted each other for about two hours. After senior officers of the British, American, French, and Italian garrison forces went to negotiate, they retreated at about 5:00 PM. At that time, a temporary curfew was declared along the river, and the situation was very tense. Traffic was restored ten minutes after the issue was resolved. The reporter's eyewitness account is recorded below:

Armed Boats Entered the Suzhou River

The enemy boats were painted in a gray-blue color, with the rising sun flag hanging at the stern, fully loaded with armed marines, about forty or fifty in total, along with several news reporters, holding cameras, mixed among them. At that time, there were many civilian boats parked in the river, and the waterway was extremely narrow. Because the two boats could not move smoothly, they ordered the boatmen on both sides to give way, threatening them with guns from time to time. When they approached the Old Zha Bridge (Fujian Road) near the Old Garbage Bridge (Zhejiang Road), they were discovered by the British garrison troops on both banks and on the bridge, who immediately ordered them to stop and prohibited them from passing. The British troops also took cover in defensive positions to prevent any eventuality. At that time, the situation was extremely tense. The patrol room immediately sent Chinese and Western police officers to the scene to disperse the pedestrians, and set up barbed wire at both bridge piers, temporarily prohibiting pedestrians from passing.

Blocked by Garrison Negotiations

The enemy boats stopped in the middle of the river, refusing to leave. At about 4:00 PM, senior officers of the British, American, French, Italian, and International Settlement Municipal Council came together and immediately negotiated with them. At that time, all that could be seen on both sides of the river were cars and motorcycles busy traveling back and forth on the north bank. After about half an hour, the British, American, and other garrison officers left first. Then the police officers notified the civilian boats to move out of the way, clearing the waterway. At about 5:00 PM, the two boats began to retreat in single file. When passing the Old Zha Bridge, one person released five carrier pigeons, apparently to transmit a message. About ten minutes later, traffic was restored.

Purpose Was to Attack Our Troops

Afterwards, according to the person in charge of the British garrison troops, the Japanese troops had complied with the order to retreat and would probably not come again in the future. As for the enemy boats' intention for this trip, it seemed to be to test the attitude of the concession authorities, trying to open this route to attack our troops. It was heard that the enemy even argued strongly at the time, saying that the Suzhou River has always been managed by our country, and now that the enemy troops have occupied Zhabei, they have the right to travel there. Later, due to a lack of reason, they said that they could not retreat without orders from their superiors. Their barbarity and unreasonableness can be imagined. However, in the end, due to the strong attitude of the British side, they had no choice but to retreat. What will happen in the future is worth our attention.

### The National Flag Fluttered, A Mighty Sight, Our Isolated Army Repelled the Enemy Four Times

So far, it has been three days and three nights, totaling one hundred hours. The enemy fears our machine gun fire and uses police dogs to drag back the corpses. Brave soldiers shout, "Long live the Republic of China!"

Our 88th Division's Xie Regiment, Yang Battalion's isolated army of eight hundred, remained safely stationed yesterday in the Sihang Warehouse on Guangfu Road, north of Suzhou Creek, using their minimal ammunition to make a final stand against the enemy, vowing to defend this piece of Zhabei to the death. Although the enemy forces attacked continuously from morning till night, they remained unshaken, with no casualties among the brave soldiers. Nearby citizens voluntarily fasted for a day, using the saved grains of rice to support the isolated army. Comfort items piled up like mountains. Chinese and foreigners alike flocked to admire them, shouting "Long live the Republic of China!" across Suzhou Creek. The bright and dazzling blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag fluttered atop the tall building, boldly proclaiming its inviolable spirit. This truly sets an unprecedented and magnificent record in the history of European wars.

Holding Firm for One Hundred Hours Without Retreating

It is verified that these eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers, led by Deputy Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu, retreated into the warehouse from their original station at the North Railway Station at 1:00 AM on the 26th. They have now been defending this piece of Zhabei to the death for three days and three nights, totaling one hundred hours. During this time, the enemy forces have exhausted all means to try to drive away our loyal and brave soldiers, but they have been repelled by the extraordinary spirit of our isolated army. The British troops stationed in the area, many of whom had participated in the European war, believed that there had been no such loyal and courageous spirit even in the European war. Therefore, they sincerely and earnestly advised our troops to lay down their arms and ammunition and retreat into the concession, so as not to make a heroic sacrifice. Our army was very grateful for the British troops' loving friendship, but all eight hundred of our brave soldiers were determined to sacrifice themselves for the country and were willing to shed their last drop of blood to defend this precious last position, making the most glorious sacrifice in a final stand against the Japanese army. Therefore, apart from expressing gratitude to the British troops, none of the brave soldiers were willing to accept the request to escape. Seeing this situation, many of the British troops were also moved and praised them.

Four Fierce Attacks All Repelled

At 3:00 AM, 7:10 AM, 3:45 PM, and 5:10 PM yesterday, the enemy forces launched four fierce attacks on the warehouse where our army was stationed, all of which were repelled by our army. The two attacks in the afternoon were the most intense, killing more than forty enemy soldiers. The bodies were abandoned by the Suzhou Creek, and the enemy did not dare to collect them, instead using police dogs to drag them away. The four attacks are described in detail below: (1) At 3:00 AM and 7:10 AM, each time the enemy forces consisted of only a dozen or so soldiers, carrying guns and ammunition, sneaking in along the wall from next door. Our army had already detected them, but pretended not to know. When the enemy approached the warehouse door, they immediately took advantage of the high ground, throwing grenades fiercely at the enemy. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the enemy hurriedly fled westward for their lives, and many of them were shot and killed. (2) At about 3:30 PM, the enemy used two motorboats, each carrying more than a hundred soldiers and a light machine gun. The soldiers each carried rifles or grenades and sailed from the Huangpu River into the Suzhou Creek, heading towards the Sihang Warehouse. When they sailed past the Waibaidu Bridge to the embankment of the old garbage bridge, they were discovered by the British troops stationed along the Suzhou Creek. They immediately blocked their advance, advising the enemy troops in extremely amiable language not to advance, so as not to endanger the concession. After two hours of negotiations, they finally left. (3) At 3:45 PM, rifle and machine gun fire erupted from the area near the new garbage bridge embankment, interspersed with the sound of grenades and steel cannons. More than sixty enemy soldiers had attacked for the third time from the Shanghai Bank warehouse. When the enemy approached, our army peered out, concentrating their minds, boosting their courage, and firing machine guns and grenades like rain. Most of the attacking enemy soldiers were hit and fell to the ground, and the rest fled. Enemy corpses were abandoned in front of the warehouse door and by the Suzhou Creek, and the enemy did not dare to come to collect them for a long time. After a while, several police dogs, as tall as children, were seen coming forward to grab the enemy corpses in their mouths, intending to drag them back. Our army immediately fired with rifles, and one dog was also hit and killed. (4) At 5:10 PM, more than ten enemy soldiers launched a fourth fierce attack. After our army fired a machine gun for about two minutes, the attacking enemy was finally repelled. In this battle, four or five enemy soldiers were killed, while our army suffered no casualties.

National Flag Fluttering, Spirit Soaring

Yesterday, from morning till night, the reporter stood on a high building at the intersection of Changsha Road to observe. What I saw cannot be fully described in words. At about 5:00 AM, the nearby alleys were already crowded with people, including some foreigners, admiring our loyal and brave soldiers across the river. Comfort items piled up like mountains at each road intersection. There were more than ten trucks at the garbage bridge embankment on Xiamen Road, filled with food such as bread, candy, and fruit. Among the crowd, there was also a foreign woman throwing a bundle of cigarettes from the south bank to the north bank, but unfortunately, her aim was inaccurate, and they all fell into the Suzhou Creek. Two national flags were hung on the left and right of the south-facing window of the Sihang Warehouse. On the roof of the building, a blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag, about six feet long and four feet wide, was raised high, fluttering in the wind, boldly proclaiming its inviolable spirit amidst the surrounding enemy flags. The people looked up at it, feeling even more excited, and respectfully admired the loyal and courageous spirit of the eight hundred soldiers. They took off their hats and waved them across the river to salute our army. Our brave soldiers also shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" from the high ground, their voices both strong and fierce. This kind of magnificent and great spirit inspires infinite admiration and emotion.

People Stand and Take Off Their Hats to Salute

After the news spread that the eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers of our isolated army were holding firm in the Sihang Warehouse on Guangfu Road in Zhabei, refusing to retreat, the whole country was excited and the world was shocked. What was most exciting was that yesterday morning, as the first rays of dawn rose, the glorious national emblem of the blue sky and white sun, representing our great Republic of China, was firmly established on the top of the high warehouse, fluttering in the wind, making it even more brilliant. Foreigners and Chinese people flocked to observe it, endlessly. The area around Yu Qiaqing Road and Xinzha Road was jammed. People across the river, passing through the area, took off their hats and faced north, saluting the national flag and the loyal and brave soldiers. At that time, foreign people, seeing this scene, also expressed deep sympathy. The reporter also participated in this grand roadside ceremony and personally heard two Westerners talking to each other, roughly saying that Japan, which has been recuperating for sixty years and is known as a first-class power in East Asia, has been fighting bitterly with China, which has been in civil war for twenty years, in a corner of Shanghai for more than seventy days, and has only made five miles of progress. It is enough for the Japanese to feel ashamed now that the world is watching. On the banks of the Suzhou Creek in Zhabei, which the Japanese army has allegedly occupied, the brilliant national flag of China, with its blue sky and white sun, is found flying high. What could be more interesting than this? Japan has left a stain on the history of its invasion of China that cannot be washed away.

Division Commander Sun Urges Brave Soldiers to Defend to the Death

Sun Yuanliang, the commander of the 88th Division, wrote to the brave soldiers defending the stronghold in Zhabei on the 29th. The original letter reads: "Deputy Regiment Commander Xie, Battalion Commander Yang, and my loyal and brave soldiers, I am currently on the front line. Although I am on the front line, my heart and soul are with all the soldiers in Zhabei. I was ordered to operate the defensive axis of Zhabei to protect our territory. Comrades, you have bravely resisted the enemy and defended it for two and a half months. The Japanese invaders have ultimately failed to cross the Lei Pool boundary. You have served the country, and I am fortunate that you are not behind others. Recently, due to the movement of a hair, the entire line shifted westward, and our army was also ordered to transfer its position, entrusting the responsibility of defending Zhabei to my loyal and brave soldiers. Comrades, you can obey orders, defend the stronghold to the death, and vow to coexist with Zhabei. I and all the officers and soldiers of the army pay the highest respect to this kind of firm and unwavering spirit of being ordered in danger. Since ancient times, the Chinese nation has had many brave people who are willing to face difficulties. The Yue Family Army stood firm, and General Qi's soldiers were brave and repelled the enemy. They dedicated themselves to the country, and their heroic spirit will forever remain in the world. Our National Revolutionary Army is endowed with this virtue, and with the teachings of the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, we do not hesitate to sacrifice and have long embraced the determination to become benevolent. This battle has been fought to kill the enemy, truly opening a historical miracle that shook the world. Hundreds of millions of descendants of our Yellow Emperor, and hundreds of millions of people all over the world, will surely read this page of history with sincerity. Comrades, you have been guarding Zhabei in isolation for three days. The enemy's timidity and our bravery have been seen by the whole world. Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai admire you, and the people are running around to help, all bearing the wish that "if it can be redeemed, a hundred lives will be spent." This is truly the glory of our Chinese nation, the glory of our Republic of China, and the glory of the soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army. I hope that you will continue to fight bravely, complete the mission of resisting the enemy, and shed the last drop of blood. - Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, is particularly pleased with the heroic sacrifices of all the comrades. I respectfully relay this message. Sun Yuanliang, October 29th."

Regiment Commander Xie's Letter Is Passionate and Inspiring

Yesterday, a certain organization in this city obtained a letter from Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan, who is holding firm in the Sihang Warehouse at the northern end of the new garbage bridge. It roughly stated that "Soldiers take obedience as their bounden duty, and it is their duty to defend the country and protect the soil. We will spill the last drop of blood and demand a considerable price from the Japanese pirates. We will also use every gun and bullet to deal with the enemy to the end." His passion and generosity are admirable.

The Sihang Authorities Consider It an Honor

Since our isolated army stationed themselves in the Sihang Savings Society Warehouse on Guangfu Road in Zhabei, they have held firm and refused to retreat despite the persuasion of all parties and the encirclement and attacks of the enemy. People from China and abroad have admired this spirit of sacrifice and struggle. The reporter made a special trip yesterday to visit Mr. Qian Xinzhi of the Sihang Bank to inquire about his thoughts on our army's stationing in the Sihang Warehouse. According to him, the magnificent actions of our army are sufficient to add a final and particularly brilliant page to the glorious war history of our Zhabei. Our warehouse has also been greatly enhanced by this. Even if the warehouse is destroyed as a result, we will not care. Furthermore, the achievements of our loyal and brave soldiers this time are even more valuable than the martyrdom of Tian Heng's subordinates in history. It would be very fortunate if the warehouse in its insignificance could become as immortal as Tian Heng Island in the future. We should carve this glorious achievement in stone as a permanent memorial.

He Xiangning's Letter Is Full of Comfort and Encouragement

Ms. He Xiangning sent a letter yesterday to comfort the brave soldiers holding the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei, saying: "To Regiment Commander Xie and all the dear eight hundred heroes, I saw your heroic and courageous spirit in the newspaper, which moved me to tears. But when I ran to the bridge, I couldn't pass through. I can only quietly look at the other side and send you my full and pious love. Every one of you has the revolutionary spirit and the spirit of sacrifice. Whether you succeed or become benevolent, you can be worthy of yourselves. The martyrs will become more great because of you, the soldiers on the front line will become more brave because of you, the people of the whole country will become more united because of you, and international people will also be able to advocate justice more because of you. I have tried to send you some first aid supplies and food, to express my heart. I hope you will fight hard and be full of Sun Yat-sen's and the Party's representatives' hard struggle and sacrifice to the end. Respectfully salute to resist the enemy, He Xiangning, October 29th."

Eight Hundred Thousand Workers in Shanghai Pay Their Respects

The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions sent a letter to the eight hundred heroes, saying: "To Deputy Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu of the 88th Division, and all the eight hundred brave soldiers, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan on August 13, our loyal and brave soldiers have fought bravely with their hot blood and heads under the fierce fire of the powerful enemy. Wherever the banner of righteousness pointed, they have repeatedly frustrated the enemy's advance. The glorious and great achievements have aroused unlimited sympathy from the international community and warm admiration from the people in the rear. After fighting hard for two and a half months, we had to painfully withdraw from Zhabei because the large-scale position was broken through by the enemy. However, all the officers and soldiers of your regiment, even though they were in the midst of fire and enemy encirclement, were still willing to shed the last drop of blood, hold the Sihang Warehouse in isolation, and demand the final price from the enemy, fighting for the great personality of our Chinese nation. The uprightness and grandeur are truly shocking to the heavens and moving to the ghosts and gods. The loyalty and greatness can obscure the sun and moon and shine brightly. The Federation of Trade Unions respectfully dedicates its sincere blood and represents eight hundred thousand workers in Shanghai to pay the highest respect and deep comfort to the eight hundred heroes of your army. I am moved to tears as I write this letter. I hope you will accept it. Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions respectfully."

Public Comfort Can Be Converted to Cash

Since the eight hundred heroes of Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan have been holding firm in the Sihang Warehouse, donations from all parties have been extremely enthusiastic. However, there is too much food, which will inevitably rot. It is best to convert it into cash and hand it over to the Shanghai Comfort Committee, so that the items needed by Regiment Commander Xie can be purchased at any time. However, when donating, please specify that it is for the use of Regiment Commander Xie's regiment of the 88th Division.

The Women's Movement Association Telegrams to Plead for Withdrawal

The China Women's Movement League telegrammed Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "To Madam Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, the isolated army in Zhabei is holding firm and refusing to retreat. Their righteous courage is heart-stirring. Please represent our women's community and beg Chairman Chiang to immediately order a withdrawal to preserve the lives of these eight hundred patriotic soldiers, so that they can be used for long-term resistance. Sincerely, the Shanghai China Women's Movement League."

Western Newspapers Describe It as Admirable and Moving

The North China Daily News said that the Chinese soldiers in the Continental Bank warehouse on North Suzhou Road were still holding the building yesterday. It was reported that many people were urging Chairman Chiang to order them to withdraw from Zhabei. Yesterday, at least two foreign military commanders stationed in Shanghai also telegraphed Nanjing. However, the soldiers of the battalion were unmoved despite all kinds of persuasion. The appeals to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek from all parties showed that the whole city was concerned about the fate of the brave soldiers and expressed sympathy for them. Their courageous spirit was praised by everyone. Yesterday, Chinese and foreigners applied to Mayor Yu and other Chinese officials to find a way to get the brave soldiers to withdraw. One woman was crying while talking on the phone. Many people inquired about the safety of the brave soldiers. A foreigner told Mayor Yu with a surprised voice that there was a shocking rumor that the Japanese army planned to destroy the two warehouses held by the battalion at noon yesterday. Yesterday, people went to Yu Qiaqing Road to see the brave soldiers, causing a traffic jam. It was difficult for the police to maintain order. A representative of the North China Daily News also looked forward from near the Shanghai Waterworks, seeing two Chinese women wiping away tears with towels. The observers were all moved and praised the bravery of the soldiers of the battalion. After the Japanese army occupied Zhabei, they tried to occupy the warehouse from Tuesday morning, but each time they went, they were driven back by the defending soldiers. This resistance could be seen from high places across the river. According to reports, the battalion had refused to retreat into the concession no less than five times on Tuesday, after being persuaded by foreign military officers and the Municipal Council. Yesterday, friends from China and abroad continued to urge them, but to no avail. There were occasional machine gun and rifle sounds near the area throughout the day yesterday. Japanese soldiers used machine guns to shatter several glass windows of a warehouse, but the defending soldiers ignored it. When the Japanese soldiers approached the building, they threw several grenades at them. At about 3:00 PM, three Japanese planes flew over the two warehouses at a relatively low altitude, and the defending soldiers fired at them with machine guns mounted on the roof. The Japanese planes flew away without dropping a single bomb.

### Atrocities of Our Army in Eastern Shanxi Are Escalating, New Defensive Positions Are Completed

A certain unit has been ordered to begin a counterattack. Division Commander Terada has indeed been killed. The enemy's fierce attack in northern Shanxi was repelled by us. Fierce fighting took place in Mengteng Village, western Xinzhou, yesterday.

[Taiyuan] Our army's new defensive positions in eastern Shanxi have been completed, and a certain unit has been ordered to begin a counterattack. Fierce fighting is expected to occur east of Yangquan within days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)

[Taiyuan] Military intelligence reports that enemy Division Commander Terada was killed by our army during the battle in Xinkou. The enemy secretly concealed this news. It has recently been learned that Terada's body has been transported to Tianjin for cremation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)

[Taiyuan] On the northern Shanxi front, at about 3:00 AM on the 28th, more than a thousand enemy soldiers launched a strong attack on the front and right flank of our certain brigade. They used illumination bombs, incendiary bombs, grenade launchers, and automatic weapons in combination. A portion of them also secretly approached using tunnels. Our defending soldiers were limited in number, and reinforcements could not arrive in time. The situation was critical for a time. For the sake of annihilating the Japanese pirates and ensuring the position, the brigade commander of our certain brigade immediately led his subordinates to fight to the death with the enemy. The morale was greatly boosted as a result, and everyone fought bravely and took the lead, fighting against ten enemies with one soldier, vying to kill the Japanese bandits. The enemy's tricks ultimately failed. Our side won the victory. In this battle, more than two hundred enemy soldiers were killed, and dozens of rifles were captured. More than fifty of our officers and soldiers were wounded. On the 29th, while the two sides were in a stalemate, our reinforcements also arrived and will soon launch an attack on the enemy.

### Atrocities Are Escalating, Enemy Planes Bomb Songjiang and Jiashan

Dropping More Than a Hundred Bombs in Songjiang, City Houses and Ordinary People Were Destroyed

[Songjiang] Songjiang has been in a state of unrest since being subjected to two inhuman bombings by enemy planes on September 7th and October 24th. Yesterday (the 28th), it was again subjected to indiscriminate bombing. The extent of the damage was detailed in yesterday's telegram. Unexpectedly, at 8:15 this morning, two enemy planes flew over the city from the northeast, dropping four or five bombs. Our defending forces returned fire, and they fled in panic. The losses are unknown. Then, starting at 9:00, nine enemy single-wing heavy bombers came again, circling in the sky, taking turns bombing indiscriminately and strafing with machine guns for more than an hour before flying back in the original direction. After the reporter rushed to the scene to investigate, it was found that many bombs had hit the × Mansion, × Bureau, × Academy, and the County Hospital in the city, causing slight damage. More than ten houses were destroyed, and several people were killed or injured in the hospital and the × Bureau. Details are being investigated. Twenty to thirty houses were destroyed at the corner of Hechi Lane and Sanggong Street. Many bombs hit the areas of Dawuqiao, Aijiaqiao, Beicangqiao, and Heiqiao, with no less than a hundred houses collapsing. The area between Fangle Bridge and Fozhi Bridge was the worst. Five to sixty pedestrians were injured by machine gun fire at the Ximenkou, and six people were killed on the spot. From the Diaochao Bridge to the Changqiao area, many bombs were dropped. The Yue Temple Daofang and the × building collapsed, injuring three to four police officers stationed there. At the same time, the Feng residence in Mojia Lane was bombed and destroyed. Zhu Rizhang Silk and Cloth Store, as well as the Zhu residence, Yang residence, Yiren Sauce Garden, Lime Store, and Haisong Barber Shop on the streets across the river were all bombed and destroyed or collapsed, totaling thirty to forty buildings. The American Le'en Church and the Muwei Girls' School established by the Inner Beauty Church caught fire after being hit by incendiary bombs. Six to seven houses near the Gangbang Line (street name) and Yanggongtang were destroyed, and the hall building collapsed as a result. The Tang Yun Chu residence west of Malu Bridge was completely destroyed by a bomb. The main station of the Shangsong Automobile Company was also hit by a bomb and burned. About twenty houses near the Lingfeng Nunnery on the west side of Kuojie Street were bombed and destroyed or collapsed. In addition to the destruction of the buildings, thirteen people were killed or injured at Gushui Hospital. There was a bomb in Xiushui Bangnan, but there was no major damage. The Quanjie Hall in the city was also bombed and destroyed, and the neighboring houses collapsed. Several bombs were dropped on Huayang Bridge, destroying Huayang Elementary School and Wanhengtai Sauce Garden. In addition, more than ten farmers were killed or injured by machine gun fire in the nearby fields while harvesting rice. The fires in various places were extinguished by the brave firefighters from each district. The fires that started at Diaochao Bridge and Weishui Terrace spread fiercely due to the wind, despite efforts to put them out. By 8:00 PM, the fires had not been extinguished and had affected the houses on both sides east to Ximenkou. The injured and dead were rescued and buried separately by the Songyi Red Cross Rescue Team. The enemy planes dropped more than a hundred bombs in this battle. However, the number of deaths and injuries and the details of the destroyed houses are not yet known. The enemy planes disregarded international morality, destroyed cultural institutions, shot innocent civilians, and indiscriminately bombed city houses without any military equipment. Their brutality is extreme. (Special dispatch, 29th)

The third time, four bombers and three fighters came from Yuci, circling over the city for an hour, dropping more than forty bombs and committing great atrocities, destroying dozens of houses and killing or injuring many civilians.

### Enemy Warships Bomb Weitou Port in Southern Fujian Yesterday

Attempted Landing Repelled by Our Forces. Enemy Aircraft Ravage the Coasts of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou.

[Xiamen] After the enemy occupied Jinmen, they attacked Weitou Port, which belongs to Quanzhou, at 5:00 PM on the 28th. Two enemy warships bombarded the shore along with Changdong, and two other aircraft made low-level strafing runs to provide cover for over ten landing craft carrying ground troops attempting to land. Our defending forces engaged them, fighting fiercely until 6:00 PM, when the enemy retreated unsuccessfully. We only had nine civilian militiamen wounded. Weitou is located northeast of Jinmen, facing Jinjiang across the sea. It belongs to the coastal area outside the South Gate of Quanzhou and is also known as Weitou Cape, which is strategically important. After the enemy further occupied Lieyu, nearing Xiamen's harbor on the 28th, they constantly used aircraft to reconnoiter the coastlines of Xiamen Island, Tong'an, and Haicheng. From 12:00 PM to over 2:00 PM, the city of Xiamen sounded alarms four times. Enemy speedboats scouted the waters between Xiamen, Wutong, Tong'an, and Aotou but did not dare to approach. At 11:00 AM, one enemy aircraft attempted to bomb the Jiangdong Bridge on the Jiulong River in Chelu Tu, Zhangzhou, but all four bombs missed due to the intense anti-aircraft fire. Three fell into the water, and one fell east of the bridge, causing no damage. Traffic in Xiamen is normal. Furthermore, the small steamer Tong'an departed from Xiamen to Tong'an on the afternoon of the 29th and was pursued by enemy aircraft en route at Wutong. The steamer Hou'an, bound for Tong'an, was also pursued. (Twenty-ninth Special Dispatch)

[Fuzhou] According to escapees from Jinmen, when over a thousand enemy troops landed the other day, over a hundred of our civilian militiamen fought valiantly. Due to the disparity in numbers, they were forced to surrender and were immediately strafed with machine guns. All the loyal and brave militiamen died in action. (Twenty-ninth Central News Agency dispatch)

[Xiamen] Enemy aircraft ravaged the coasts of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou on the 29th. At 11:00 AM, they attempted to bomb the Jiangdong Bridge on the Zhangsong Road, but all the bombs missed. At 12:00 PM, one aircraft bombed the Wuli Bridge between Anhai and Shitou, Quanzhou, dropping one bomb that only destroyed two stone slabs. This bridge is located in a low-lying area and is not a road for vehicles to pass. Also, on the afternoon of the 29th, the small steamer Tong'an departed from Xiamen to Tong'an, carrying passengers, and was chased back by enemy aircraft, which opened fire with machine guns, fortunately without injuring anyone.

### China National Revolutionary League Announces Formal Dissolution

Sufficient to Enhance the Belief in National Unity, Contributing All Strength to the Government to Serve in the War of Resistance.

[Nanjing] The China National Revolutionary League was organized and advocated by Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Chen Youren, Xu Qian, etc., with the slogan of resisting Japan and saving the nation. Since the Lugou Bridge and Shanghai incidents, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the central government has launched a great full-scale war of resistance. The League believes that all the people of the country should do their best to support the government and resist the war under the leadership of the supreme leader in order to achieve final victory. Therefore, on October 30, it issued a declaration formally dissolving the organization of the League. The declaration is recorded as follows:

Declaration of the China National Revolutionary League

The purpose of the establishment of our China National Revolutionary League lies in promoting the concentration of the entire nation's strength to resist Japan in order to achieve China's independence, freedom, and equality. Since the Lugou Bridge and Shanghai incidents, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the whole country has resolutely waged a sacred war of self-defense. Our nation has shown unprecedented unity. At this time when this great national war is gradually unfolding, we should, with an open and sincere attitude, jointly seek the consolidation of national unity and promote the success of the national war of resistance. Therefore, in August, we issued a declaration calling on League members at home and abroad and compatriots across the country to fully mobilize, do their best, support the government, and resist the war to the end. On October 25, the Supreme Council resolved to formally dissolve the organization of the China National Revolutionary League. We firmly believe that this bright expression is sufficient to enhance the belief in the unity of the entire nation. All the strength of our League organizations at home and abroad will naturally be contributed to the government to serve in the war of resistance in order to implement our long-cherished aspirations. It is hoped that all League members will, from now on, sharpen their skills and, based on their years of determination to resist the war, become loyal soldiers of the nation. We also hope that our government, in this critical moment of survival, will actively mobilize the people of the whole country to jointly participate in this sacred national war in order to strive for final victory, complete the mission of national liberation, and realize a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is solemnly declared. (Twenty-ninth Central News Agency dispatch)

### German Newspaper Praises Our Army's Bravery

[Nanjing] The Panchen Lama recently telegraphed Nanjing, stating: "The brutal Japanese are invading our China. Our nation and our generals are, under the leadership of the Central Government, engaged in a tragic and heroic comprehensive war of resistance for the permanent survival of the nation. Over the past two months, they have dealt a serious blow to the enemy, and good news is frequently reported, arousing excitement far and wide. The Panchen Lama is obstructed in the western regions but his heart is concerned with the south. In addition to giving alms to high monks in major temples in Qinghai and Kangding and setting up altars to chant sutras and pray for the victory of our army, he plans to donate 30,000 legal tender and purchase 20,000 yuan of national salvation bonds for the needs of the war of resistance."

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Says Attacking Nanshi is Quite Difficult

Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: A Foreign Ministry spokesman, when meeting with reporters today, showed them a map of Shanghai and photographs of sandbag defenses built on the borders of Nanshi and the French Concession, explaining the difficulty of the Japanese army's attack on Nanshi to the reporters. He said that the situation was extremely complex and that although the Japanese army was being cautious everywhere, it was feared that unexpected unfortunate incidents might still occur. When asked whether the Japanese government would support Mussolini's proposal to restore Germany's position in Africa, the spokesman replied that the question was too big for him to answer.

### Enemy Warships Bomb Pudong

A Total of Over One Hundred Shells Fired; No Damage to Our Side Whatsoever - Enemy Aircraft Also Dropped Bombs -

The enemy continues to use threatening tactics against the Pudong positions. Yesterday, after 9:30 AM, the ships in the Huangpu River intermittently shelled again. Because it was during the day, the noise was reduced. A total of five warships participated, one anchored off Yangshupu, two off Huazhanpu, and three off the Taikong Wharf. At the same time, three or four enemy aircraft circled over Pudong to reconnoiter and strafed pedestrians with machine guns. The enemy warships stopped shelling around 2:00 PM, after firing over one hundred shells in total, causing no damage to our military. Around 3:00 PM, four enemy heavy bombers flew over Pudong again to circle and reconnoiter and dropped bombs, but because they flew too high and the targets were inaccurate, only a dozen or so civilian houses in the Xinmalu area were destroyed. Most of the bombs fell in the fields, causing no loss to our military. At 5:20 PM in the evening, one ship anchored off the Japanese consulate again shelled Pudong, firing five shots in succession before stopping. Also, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, three enemy aircraft dropped six bombs in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, destroying a dozen civilian houses and killing four residents.

### Jiaotong University Never Used for Military Purposes

The School is Now a Refugee Shelter. The French Side Notifies the Japanese Army Not to Attack.

Tokyo, 29th, Allied News Agency: A Japanese spokesman claimed that Jiaotong University in Xujiahui is now a military base for our army and that the Japanese side will bomb it. However, Jiaotong University is currently the Sixth Refugee Shelter organized by the International Relief Committee and has already taken in more than 1,600 refugees, and it is never used for military purposes. The Japanese claim is obviously inaccurate. It is heard that the French side of the committee has already notified Okamoto, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, asking him to inform the Japanese authorities not to bomb it.

### Zhu Yaohua Not Yet Dead

His Injuries Are Too Severe, and There is Little Hope of Survival

Central News Agency, Field Correspondent, 8:00 PM, 29th Report: ×× Division Commander Zhu Yaohua, because Dachan fell, affecting the overall situation of the Shanghai battle, had no face to meet his superiors and comrades and shot himself yesterday to apologize to the people. The bullet entered from the left chest, pierced the lungs, and exited from the stomach. He immediately fell to the ground, but when collecting the body, it was suddenly discovered that Division Commander Zhu still had a weak breath. He was immediately taken to a hospital in Shanghai for treatment, but his injuries were too severe, and there was very little hope of survival. He may fulfill his intention of dying for the country.

### German Note Replies to Belgian Government, Declining to Participate in Nine-Power Conference

To Avoid Getting Involved in the Vortex; U.S. Delegation Has Arrived in Brussels; Italy Will Be Represented by the Foreign Minister.

[Berlin] Germany has now refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be convened in Beijing next month. The German reply stated that the conference was convened based on Article VII of the Nine-Power Treaty, and the topic for discussion is how to implement that article. Since Germany is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, it feels unable to participate in the conference. However, the reply stated that Germany is willing to participate in actions aimed at resolving disputes when adequate guarantees are obtained for the indispensable preliminary conditions. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)

[Berlin] The German government has recently decided to refuse to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Since the Belgian government invited Germany to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, political figures initially declared that there was no inconvenience for Germany to send representatives to the Brussels conference. However, they later changed their minds, believing that it was better for Germany to maintain a neutral attitude toward the conflict between China and Japan. Although German political figures support Japan's policies, believing that their purpose is to prevent the new development of Bolshevism in the Far East, if Germany openly sided with Japan, it would be regarded as an unfriendly attitude in China. For this reason, the German government has recently decided not to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, preferring to stay out of the conflict between China and Japan. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)

⊙Brussels The U.S. delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, led by Chief Delegate Davis, arrived here from Paris yesterday evening. U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Gibson and representatives from the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed them at the station. After Mr. Davis got out of the car, he refused to make any statements to reporters. (Maritime Telegraph dispatch, 29th)

[Nanjing] Diplomatic sources say that the Soviet Union has decided to send representatives to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The candidate will be led by Foreign Minister Litvinov. Our representative Gu Weijun telegraphed that he will go to Belgium in one day. (Special dispatch, 29th)

[Rome] The Italian delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference may be led by Foreign Minister Count Ciano. If so, Ciano may take the opportunity to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden for discussions. However, this matter will not be definitively decided until the last moment. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)

### Major Powers Should Take Collective Action to Deal with Pacific Aggressors

[Moscow] On the matter of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet government's official newspaper, "News," recently commented that convening a conference to discuss practical measures to stop illegal and criminal adventures is clumsy and useless. On the contrary, the countries directly concerned, if they can take joint action to deal with aggressive actions on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, will be sufficient. After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference opens in Brussels, it may soon produce a new Non-Intervention Committee. The German delegation has obviously obtained Japan's permission to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, seemingly representing allied countries dedicated to aggression and violating international treaties. In this way, even if Japan does not attend, someone can speak for it. What is regrettable is that the so-called Western democratic countries do not have the necessary determination and perseverance to maintain peace in the Far East. In the United States, Japan's aggressive actions are a very serious blow to the interests held by the United States in the Far East. President Roosevelt expressed a more practical attitude towards maintaining peace in his recent speech. This U.S. foreign policy may contribute to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)

### U.S. Newspapers Criticize Japan for Violating International Treaties

[New York] U.S. newspapers hold different opinions on Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The "New York Post" and "World-Telegram" express pessimism about the future of the conference. The "New York Sun" and "Times" criticize Japan's attitude. The "New York Post" (which seems to lean towards the Republican Party) says that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can only achieve a moral condemnation of Japan and non-recognition of the situation created by its aggression in order to save the faces of the participants. Other than that, there is no practical effect, just like the U.S. non-recognition of "Manchukuo". The "New York Times" (which leans towards the Democratic Party) says that Japan repeatedly defends itself, claiming that the invasion of China is for self-defense, which is hard to believe. Japan also says that the Sino-Japanese conflict does not involve the Nine-Power Treaty, which assumes that countries around the world have forgotten Japan's acts of aggression. The "Sun" says that Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference proves that the Japanese military has once again succeeded in obstructing the country's diplomatic authorities. (National Telegraph, 29th)

### New Governor Discusses Far East Problem

[Guangzhou] At a welcome reception in Hong Kong on the 28th, the newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong, Geoffry Northcote, spoke about the Far East issue, saying that today, amidst the prevailing turmoil, China and Japan are at war. I do not wish to comment on the right and wrong of this incident, but the League of Nations Advisory Committee is making its best efforts to find a way to resolve this slaughter of humanity and destruction of humanity. I wish to join everyone in hoping that the Brussels conference will proceed smoothly, so that the crisis developing in China today can be eliminated. Now, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty are engaged in this purpose, and no efforts exceed those of the British Empire. Hong Kong can certainly contribute to this, and I hope that we will do our best to follow it. Finally, Governor Northcote specifically mentioned the "neighborly" policy adopted by the previous governor, saying that he is determined to continue to implement it with the greatest effort.

### Japan's Unquenchable Aggression Arouses Vigilance in Various Countries

Urgently Seeking to Strengthen Far East Defenses; Britain Speeds Up Shipbuilding

⊙Manila The Sino-Japanese war has prompted European countries with territories in the Far East that are affected by Japan's southward policy to urgently seek to strengthen their defense work. Britain is at the forefront, so despite the fierce arms race in Europe, it has to allocate some of its strength to consider the military bases in Singapore and Hong Kong. The Netherlands, due to the fertile land of the East Indies, will further massively strengthen its Asian armaments next month, adding aircraft and warships. The Philippines, being adjacent to Japan, has established an autonomous government for less than two years and is using a quarter of its annual revenue to build an army. The Philippines feels a particular stake in the Sino-Japanese war, fearing that it will be annexed by Japan once it becomes independent. Soviet Russia's military strength in Siberia is comparable to Japan's, with 300,000 troops in addition to a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks. At the same time, French Indochina, in light of Japan's southward policy, has to reorganize its military. Thailand, although on very good terms with Japan, is still purchasing warships from Japan and Italy to establish a navy, showing that Japan's aggressive ambitions have been eyed by the world. (National Telegraph, 28th)

[London] It is claimed here that, according to Britain's armament plan, 32 warships were newly completed in January of this year, including six cruisers, nine destroyers, three submarines, and fourteen minesweepers. Next year's plan is to add one aircraft carrier, five cruisers, sixteen destroyers, ten submarines, and sixteen small ships. As for 1939, four aircraft carriers, seven cruisers, twenty-four destroyers, seven submarines, and eleven small ships will be built. In 1940, the two battleships "George V" and "Prince of Wales" will be built. (Maritime Telegraph, 29th)

### Britain's Far East Policy Still Based on League of Nations

British Undersecretary Speaks in the House of Commons; Pleased with U.S. Participation and Cooperation

[London] Undersecretary Cranborne spoke in the House of Commons today, stating that Geneva will do its best to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute and that Britain's foreign policy is still based on the League of Nations. During the debate on the address to the British monarch, Cranborne rose to intervene and refute the opposition party's criticism that the king's speech did not directly mention the League of Nations, proving that the government had abandoned the League, saying that the opposition party's remarks were completely unfounded, just as if the speech did not mention maintaining the constitution, it would immediately be said that it was the precursor to a red revolution. Cranborne continued that the League of Nations is currently encountering a very special kind of problem. The House of Commons should know that the British government has tried to make close contact with the U.S. government, which is very important. Not only London thinks so, but Geneva also thinks so. This move has had a great impact on the resolution of the 22-member Advisory Committee to deal with the problem. When the committee gathered, it recognized that there are two main tasks: first, to be the mouthpiece of world opinion. The committee's conduct of this work has expressed alarm at the inhuman and barbaric methods of warfare used in the dispute, and it is necessary to review all the facts that have occurred since the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident. After a completely objective and fair review by the committee, it was unanimously decided that Japan should not take the actions it has taken, which have violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Peace Pact. Its report has implemented the first step of the League of Nations' work. The second step is even more urgent, that is, to end the war if possible. The League of Nations must not only decide what kind of action is in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant, what kind of action seems to be effective, but also what kind of action seems to be the most promising basis for consideration, whether the League of Nations acts alone or on other bases. If the League of Nations acts alone, it cannot take any moderate or other actions without the full participation of non-member states whose cooperation it must obtain. This is very obvious. Is there any other more effective basis than the Covenant? It covers all the points whose cooperation seems necessary. In view of these facts, the committee proposed convening a Nine-Power Treaty Conference to consider the dispute. Now, some people still say that the League of Nations, in addition to making suggestions, should take economic action on its own. This is to ignore an important factor, that is, it is necessary to know the degree of cooperation before one can speak of whether any action taken seems to be effective. Since the basis of the League of Nations' independent action has failed to satisfy this condition, if action is taken without knowing whether it seems to be effective, it will not only fail, but it is indeed dangerous. The Undersecretary concluded that the action taken by the League of Nations to consult with the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty is the only promising way forward.

### Ambassador Wang Speaks in the U.S.

Stating That We Are Determined to Resist Japan's Aggression to the End

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting spoke at a luncheon at the National Press Club today, saying that China has made more progress in the past ten years than in a hundred years, and has surpassed Japan in many aspects. Japan is worried that China will complete its work, so it is at war with China in order to stop its progress, but Japan will never succeed. The Chinese people are determined to resist the war to the end, and even if there is only one soldier and one bullet left, they will fight. (Reuters dispatch)

Wang mocked Japan's propaganda that Japan is willing to be friendly with China, saying that I believe that countries around the world will not believe Japan's lies, because there is no one in the world who is friendly to people but attacks them. If one speaks of friendship but actually attacks people, then their purpose must be to kill or enslave people. (National Telegraph, 28th)

[Washington] Six American peace groups today, regarding the policies of the American naval authorities, once again unleashed their eloquent voices, launching attacks, especially expressing deep dissatisfaction with the order from the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, that "if Japanese aircraft attack American defense positions in Shanghai, retaliate as appropriate." They believe that this action is greatly contrary to the spirit of the neutrality law and will inevitably involve the United States in a political vortex. Therefore, they are demanding that the government promptly reiterate its neutrality policy. (28th National)

### Italy Supports Germany's Demand for the Return of Colonies

The Prelude to Joint Practical Action Lloyd George Criticizes British Foreign Policy

[London] Mussolini's support for Germany's demand for the return of colonies is seen here today as the initial step toward joint practical action between the two countries, which is of great significance for the future relationship between Britain and France. Furthermore, according to powerful figures here, after the Great War, it was the governments of the British autonomous dominions, not London, that accepted Germany's colonies. For example, the Union of South Africa took over Germany's colonies in southwestern Africa, which has nothing to do with London. Moreover, if Britain agrees to Germany's request, Britain's position in Africa will also be greatly disadvantaged. For example, if Tanganyika in north-central Africa is returned to Germany, Britain's Kenya will be surrounded by German and Italian territories. Therefore, Britain is even more concerned about this matter than France. (29th National dispatch)

[London] The Times recently published an article arguing that Germany's demand for the restoration of its former colonies is quite legitimate, and believing that if Britain makes concessions on the colonial issue, Germany may be able to assist in the resolution of various European problems. After reading this, officials here expressed dissatisfaction, especially criticizing the idea of "exchanging" colonies for German cooperation, saying that this view is absolutely contrary to Britain's current policy. Conservative Party members said that the party unanimously passed resolutions at its two major conferences last year and this year, advocating that all of the country's colonies must not be divided in any way. This resolution is sufficient to reflect the government's views, which is very clear. (28th Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency)

[London] Lloyd George said in the House of Commons today, roughly saying that the establishment of the Spanish Non-Intervention Committee is the most despicable act of deception by so-called great powers against small and weak nations, and it is also a conspiracy to put Britain and France at a disadvantage in future wars. Mussolini's desire for peace is nothing more than to allow his fellow dictators to have time to prepare. "I don't believe it. Please look at Mussolini's actions and arrangements, such as the deployment of a large number of troops to Libya, the invasion of Abyssinia, the incitement of unrest in Palestine, the construction of air force and submarine bases in the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, and the installation of German heavy artillery in Morocco to target Gibraltar. What is his purpose? It is very clear. Therefore, the position of the British Empire today, whether in the East or the West, is far worse than before." (28th National News Agency)

### Italian Fascists Commemorate with Congratulations from the German Leader

[Berlin] Yesterday was the beginning of the sixteenth year of Italian Fascism. The German leader, Hitler, sent a message to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to congratulate him, pointing out that the Fascist Party's entry into Rome was the key to the progress of the entire Europe, and wishing the Italian Prime Minister happiness and success in his service to the country and his efforts for European civilization and peace. (29th Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency)

### The Non-Intervention Committee Reopened Yesterday

Significant Progress May Be Made on the Issue of Withdrawing Volunteers

[London] The subcommittee of the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee is scheduled to continue its meeting at 3 PM tomorrow. British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne announced in the House of Commons today that, regarding the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers, all national representatives except the Soviet representative have now accepted the draft resolution prepared by the subcommittee. Even regarding the Soviet Union, they may change their attitude at tomorrow's meeting. Therefore, people generally believe that tomorrow's meeting will make significant progress on the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers. However, how the draft resolution should be revised to be accepted by the Soviet Union will inevitably cause Guiping's trouble, so that the work of the subcommittee will still be watched before next week for tangible results. British observers at all levels said that the subcommittee may draft a kind of "agreement in principle." At that time, after the large-scale withdrawal of foreign volunteers, recognizing both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups will naturally be discussed. However, the definition of "large-scale withdrawal" is the main difficulty. (28th Havas dispatch from Central News Agency)

### Spanish Government Decides to Move Capital to Barcelona

⊙Valencia The Republican government will issue an order on the 30th of this month to move the government from this city to Barcelona, the capital of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia. The cabinet held a meeting yesterday to decide on various relocation measures and resolved that the next cabinet meeting would be held in Barcelona. It is reported that the main reason for the government's move is to reorganize the military industry in Catalonia. As for Catalonia, it will still maintain its autonomous status.

### British Resident Officer in Palestine Resigns

[London] Colonial Secretary Gore announced in the House of Commons today that the Resident Officer in Palestine, Wauchope, has resigned. He said that Wauchope took this position in 1931 and took sick leave in September this year to return to England for recuperation. He originally planned to return to his post in mid-November, but now he feels that his health has not recovered and he cannot continue to hold this difficult position for a long time. He has served for six years and has been loyal and diligent in his duties under extremely difficult circumstances, resulting in accumulated overwork and illness. The government deeply admires him for this. (29th Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency)

[London] Political figures here were extremely surprised to hear the news of Wauchope's resignation, because it was a time of great difficulty. These people are deeply afraid that Wauchope's resignation will make extreme elements in Palestine even more active. According to the "Daily Mail," it is speculated that after Wauchope's resignation, he will be succeeded by the former commander-in-chief of the British Army in India, Chetwode, or the Governor of Bengal, India, Anderson.

Commentary

### Political Work Under the Threat of Enemy Aircraft

— Appropriate

In this war, the main areas of activity of the enemy air force are mostly not on the battlefield, but in prosperous cities and towns lacking air defense facilities. For example, Songjiang City is quite far from the war zone, but the bombing disasters it has suffered in recent days have not been reduced compared to the front lines of the battlefield. In just one instance yesterday morning, enemy aircraft dropped more than 130 bombs, targeting mostly bustling markets and peaceful citizens. This inhumane and brutal act only makes our compatriots more aware of the true face of the enemy. Militarily, it is simply meaningless.

Nevertheless, for the sake of the future of our resistance, we cannot simply let these disasters run their course. We must actively work on prevention beforehand and relief afterward. We must also pay attention to the wartime organization of the people, so that local order is not affected in the slightest by the enemy aircraft's rampage. Regarding the specific direction of this effort, I now put forward two points, hoping that military and political authorities and leaders from all walks of life will consider them.

First, in all areas suffering from air raids, military and political authorities and enlightened people from the community should actively utilize the baojia system, ensuring that all residents, regardless of gender or age, are closely organized to automatically undertake all work adapted to wartime needs, such as air defense, digging trenches, rescue, transportation, eliminating traitors, production cooperation, and consumer cooperation.

Second, the government should quickly find ways to ensure that the poor people who have suffered from the war can continue to maintain a minimum standard of living. Regarding this point, the most effective methods, in addition to setting up shelters, are work relief and opening up immigration areas.

### The Responsibility of Americans in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

— Kung Sung Ai-ling

Madame Soong Ai-ling Kung, wife of Minister of Finance H.H. Kung, broadcasted a speech yesterday morning at the Jinling Radio Station, offering many suggestions regarding the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels. The wording was earnest. The following is a special translation:

Good morning, listeners. I am speaking to you at this moment from Shanghai, China. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you and wish you well, because America is like my second hometown. I studied in your country, and I know and yearn for many people in your country. In addition to personal friendship, your country is also a friendly country with similar traditions to my country. Your country deeply knows that Japan's military aggression against China is ferocious, dangerous, and destructive of humanity, not only endangering the survival of my country, but also threatening world peace.

After the last World War, the world thought that the future world peace could be guaranteed by concluding treaties and conventions. The peace of my country has become more secure due to the conclusion of the Nine-Power Treaty, as if there were strong windows, and thieves could hardly enter the house. However, even if there are strong windows, if the police disarm or pay less attention, the thieves will use the technique of drilling holes and climbing over walls. The same is true for countries. Because the major powers were trapped in the world's economic downturn, they did not have time to look abroad. Japan took this opportunity to use its skills, because Japan suffered the least damage in the last World War. He watched the national strength of most countries decline, so he took advantage of the opportunity to devote all his efforts to strengthening his military and increasing his industrial production to seize the world market. He secretly worked hard to accumulate countless military equipment, which he used to invade Chinese territory.

In the eventful times of the world, Japan has made up its mind and made a fortune on the mainland of China. He has also made up his mind to expand a larger empire. He is truly an international thief, taking risks and taking chances, disregarding the world's condemnation, to seize the spoils he envisions. He is willing to do these things because he is confident that if the countries draw their swords to help each other because he trampled on international treaties, he is prepared to deal with them. Since the seizure of Manchuria on September 18, the countries have not stopped him, and he has become even more unscrupulous and unscrupulous.

The guarantees given to my country by the Nine-Power Treaty have been completely destroyed by Japan, so he has gone a step further, wanting to achieve his goals by violent means, so he has massively destroyed lives and property in my country. He feels that the international police cannot stop the behavior of international thieves.

However, Japan unexpectedly encountered an unexpected encounter this time. What he could not have dreamed of was the Chinese resistance, and it was an unprecedented resistance, a resistance with both wisdom and courage. In this resistance, China has revealed two facts. First, China is not cowardly. The second fact is even more important, that Japan is not invincible. Although we have suffered setbacks, a previous misconception of the world has been swept away. Now the great powers can all ask themselves, "Why should we be afraid to force all countries to respect treaties in order to preserve the survival of mankind?" In fact, this kind of fear should not exist in the first place. If the world still harbors this fear, then the future of the world is indeed very dark.

Speaking of this, you will definitely ask me how to achieve peace. I say that there are many peace tasks that you can do. If you want peace, you must have the courage to engage in peace work. Otherwise, even if you shout loudly for peace, neutrality, and isolation, the god of war may suddenly come without choosing a day.

So how can you help China stop Japanese aggression and maintain peace in the Far East in accordance with the conditions of the Nine-Power Treaty? I think your country does not need to join the war. We do not ask your country to join us in fighting. In addition to participating in the war, your country can help us in many effective ways. We are grateful for your country's sympathy and spiritual assistance to us, but we still need your country's help, that is, within the possible range, we hope that your country will provide more material assistance. If your country is unwilling, it is tantamount to helping Japan to destroy our country. We need military weapons and ammunition. We need to relieve millions of homeless women and children and tens of thousands of wounded soldiers and civilians who are not protected by treaties. At the same time, we hope that your country will cooperate with us not to supply money to Japan in order to prolong the time of aggression. As long as your country's citizens do not do business with Japan, all military weapons and ammunition and goods indirectly related to the war will not be transported to Japan to avoid prolonging the war and killing peace-loving civilians in China.

We believe that no matter how stubborn Japan is, it will never be able to defeat the world's justice. Indeed, hasn't it been eleven weeks since the start of the war in Shanghai? We have long known that they are nothing more than that. Do you know that our country's troops are not prepared and that the substance of the weapons is old? However, in these eleven weeks, our troops have used flesh and blood to resist the cruel slaughter of the Japanese army equipped with the latest weapons. When blood and flesh can still resist, we have never stopped. You can know that if the world's powers really want to force Japan to abandon its militaristic policy, it is actually very easy.

You probably also know that the countries of the world will soon meet in Brussels in Beijing to promote the Nine-Power Treaty to find a peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese situation. So now is a very good time. May I ask what your country's attitude towards this meeting is and what steps will be taken in the future to support this Nine-Power Treaty with our country? Japan has deceived the countries of the world. Now he is using his deceptive means again. When he invaded China's three northeastern provinces, didn't he say that he never wanted China's territory? However, now he is invading the mainland of China. In the three northeastern provinces, he established a puppet government, and now he is busy establishing another puppet government in North China and Inner Mongolia to manage the area of North China. No matter how Japan propagandizes that the puppet government is independent, his troops and advisors have supreme authority in the puppet government. May I ask whether your country and other countries can allow him to deceive and not point out straightforwardly?

Our people are extremely concerned about the attitude taken by your country at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, because your country can do everything in the world. Will your country take active measures to respect the treaty, or will it take a vague policy to avoid right and wrong? We are very anxious about this, because the invasion of the three northeastern provinces by Japan has proved that the League of Nations is nominal, resulting in countless changes in the world, and China is afraid that it will be sacrificed again. Countless small and weak nations will inevitably be disappointed with the dignity of this League of Nations, and these many small and weak nations are anxiously watching your country, because they lack leaders, and because they are waiting and watching whether the world can abide by all future treaties. All those who abide by the treaty are now suspicious whether the days of peace will never come again. Everyone in their eyes thinks that your country must be the righteous speaker for the weak and the oppressed, and they can imagine his brave and invincible maintenance of and non-implementation of treaties, and cannot allow one nation to be threatened and slaughtered by another nation, just as today China is suffering from Japan's brutal behavior. The Beijing Conference can restore the dignity of treaties, but it can also make treaties equal to waste paper. Peace can be guaranteed or further destroyed. The great powers all have great responsibilities, and whether world culture is sacrificed, and whether the bloody tragedy in China that Japan is talking about in today's broadcast will be continued in other countries in the future, is all in the hands of this conference.

Our ideal is that your country should not have any other policy in today's position, except to work hard with the great powers to take the same simple steps, so that this kind of uncivilized thing that is not suitable for the age will never happen again. We also think that your country will be able to make all nations have faith in abiding by treaties, and it will be able to lead all countries with a firm and courageous attitude, so that the pain that China is suffering now will never be seen again. It must be implemented now to be effective, and it cannot be shirked by empty words. We cannot deceive ourselves with intelligence, nor can we deceive others with intelligence. We must have courage, especially honesty. If your country and other great powers do not take a firm approach at this Beijing Conference, then the conference will inevitably be the most unconscious conference of world politicians in world history, and the peace, humanity and democracy of the world will never be seen again.

### The Municipal Party Department Promotes a Campaign to Raise Funds for Winter Clothing by Various Groups

People Who Donate Winter Clothing Will Be Awarded Certificates Separately The Number of Clothing to Be Made Depends on the Circumstances of the Provinces and Cities

Because the soldiers fighting on the front lines are thinly clothed, the Municipal Party Department is now actively promoting a campaign to raise funds for winter clothing by national salvation groups in the city. The central government has stipulated ten measures for raising funds for winter clothing to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and ordered the party and government organs of various provinces and cities to comply. The ten measures are listed below: ㊀ Party and government authorities in provinces and cities should supervise lower-level organs in counties and cities to promote large-scale winter clothing fundraising campaigns by national salvation groups (such as anti-enemy support associations and relief associations). ㊁ The types of winter clothing to be raised should be based on the raw materials produced in each locality and can be divided into three types: leather, cotton, and silk cotton. ㊂ The size of the winter clothing must be handled in accordance with the regulations of the military organs. ㊃ The number of winter clothing to be raised should be determined by the highest party and government authorities in accordance with the standard of the number of imports and exports and the wealth of the land in each province and city. ㊄ If people in various provinces and cities donate raw materials or donate money and specify that winter clothing should be purchased, the local party and government authorities may promote textile and sewing workers and housewives to manufacture it. ㊅ People who donate 500 pieces of winter clothing per person will be given a certificate of thanks by the local government. Those who donate 1,000 pieces will be presented to the provincial government by the local government for a clear order of commendation. Those who donate 10,000 pieces will be specially awarded by the National Government. ㊆ Local party and government organs that have made excellent achievements in fundraising will be rewarded by their superior organs and will be used as one of the important evaluations. ㊇ Local organs, groups, and public officials must first respond to the call to set an example. ㊈ The winter clothing fundraising matters in various localities should be completed in the shortest possible time, and government organs should regard them as important political affairs and should not be delayed. ㊉ The winter clothing collected in various localities should be sent to the provincial and municipal authorities in the fastest possible way for consolidated planning and distribution.

### Japan Has Not Allowed Countries to Retrieve Goods

Regarding the matter of foreign merchants in this city going to Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Huishan districts to retrieve the goods stored in their warehouses, Mr. Barentzen, the German Acting Consul-General in Shanghai, proposed the other day and invited the Consuls-General of Britain, the United States, and France stationed in Shanghai to go to the Japanese Consulate-General to negotiate this case with the Japanese Consul-General. After discussion, the Japanese Consul-General did not give a firm answer of permission, but said that this matter must be considered by the Japanese army and navy before a formal reply can be given.

### British Soldiers Recount Rescuing Refugees

A Woman's Children Were All Killed Weeping Bitterly on the Iron Bridge

The China Press reported that the brave men in the two defense posts of British soldiers near the Kasfei Railway Bridge told a China Press reporter yesterday that when the Chinese army made a general retreat on Wednesday, they rescued 30 wounded Chinese refugees on the railway bridge under heavy gunfire. The refugees were advancing along the railway and were caught in the crossfire of the Chinese and Japanese soldiers' machine guns on the bridge. The situation was very dangerous. Therefore, they crawled forward and rescued the refugees to a safe location and transported them to the hospital in the concession by British military trucks. When the reporter asked for details, the brave man answered shyly, because he rescued the victims out of conscience. His chivalry is very commendable. Yesterday afternoon, a small group of British soldiers saw a Chinese woman on the side of the railway bridge, looking panicked and trembling, walking on the damaged bridge, almost unable to take a step. The crowd urged her to move forward quickly because the woman was right in the middle of the Chinese and Japanese positions, but the woman could not move quickly. When she reached the end of the bridge, she burst into tears to the crowd, because all three of her children had been killed. The crowd was heartbroken when they saw this situation. Alas, how many more people like this woman are there? Mayor Yu of this city expressed his sincere gratitude to the British, American, and Italian soldiers for their courageous and righteous actions in helping to rescue the refugees who poured into the Public Concession on Tuesday and Wednesday, and for providing initial assistance to the wounded.

### Closely Monitor the Influx of Enemy Goods

Joint Association Notifies All Manufacturers

The China National Products Manufacturers Joint Association, recently noting the resurgence of activities involving Japanese goods by unscrupulous merchants who have lost all sense of conscience and shame, yesterday issued a special notice to its member manufacturers, urging them to closely monitor enemy goods and prevent them from being disguised. The notice stated that since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai has lasted for more than two months, all sectors have resolutely severed economic ties with the enemy. However, the brutal enemy, while bombing and slaughtering our people, is exploiting unscrupulous profiteering merchants to disguise Japanese goods as domestic products and sell them everywhere. At this critical juncture for the nation's survival and the fate of our people, all citizens with a sense of conscience should advocate using domestic products to strengthen national wealth and empower the people. The association fears that member manufacturers may be deceived, so it is issuing this special notice to all businesses, urging them to pay close attention and refuse to sell any disguised goods. It is hoped that they will not disregard this notice. The association is also printing and distributing a public letter, advising everyone to carefully examine goods when purchasing them to avoid being deceived.

### Find Ways to Facilitate Factory Production

Planning Bureau Instructs the Municipal Chamber of Commerce

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday received instructions from the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that during this period of all-out resistance, all public and private factories, large and small, should increase production as much as possible and should not stop work unless absolutely necessary, in order to benefit both military and civilian needs. Previous orders from the ministry have already instructed the chamber to relay these instructions to all its members for compliance. Subsequently, the chamber reported the difficulties faced by factories in the city in resuming operations to the bureau, which then forwarded the report to the relevant authorities. Now, Instruction No. 21566 from the Ministry of Industries states that the submission has been noted and that the Ministry has already requested the First Department of the Military Affairs Commission to instruct all relevant agencies and troops to protect factories, find ways to resolve the mentioned difficulties, and facilitate factory production. The instructions were to be relayed for notification. Therefore, the chamber is hereby instructed to notify its members accordingly.

### Madame Chiang Returns to Nanjing Yesterday After Recovering from Injuries Sustained in Car Accident

Ignoring Pain After Injury, She Still Personally Went to the Front Lines to Boost Morale

Madame Soong Mei-ling, wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 23rd of this month to inspect the front lines and慰劳 the soldiers. She was accompanied by advisor Donald and one military officer, traveling in a single car. At 4:30 PM that afternoon, while traveling not far from Shanghai, the rear tire of the car suddenly burst. The car was traveling at a considerable speed, causing it to overturn into a ditch by the side of the road. Madame Chiang was violently thrown out of the car, landing fourteen feet away. She immediately lost consciousness. Donald and the officer were also thrown from the car but were not injured. They rescued Madame Chiang and took her to a nearby farmhouse. She regained consciousness after about fifteen minutes. Ignoring her injuries, Madame Chiang insisted on completing her mission to the front lines. After arriving, she inspected the front lines for about an hour before returning to Shanghai at 11:00 PM, six and a half hours after the accident. She immediately consulted a doctor and had an X-ray taken the next day, which revealed a fractured rib. After proper treatment, she has now recovered. Madame Chiang returned safely to Nanjing yesterday. According to Donald, if Madame Chiang had been thrown to the other side of the road, her life would have been in danger, as a car was speeding past at that moment. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, enemy planes have been bombing and strafing the Nanjing-Shanghai highway and railway almost daily. The British Ambassador was also wounded in an attack. Therefore, those traveling on the Nanjing-Shanghai road usually do so at night. Madame Chiang, undeterred by hardship and danger, traveled to the front lines during the day. Her fearless and courageous spirit is truly admirable. Even after the accident and injury, she insisted on completing her great mission, demonstrating her loyalty to the country and devotion to the public, which is highly commendable.

[Nanjing] Madame Chiang, wife of Chairman Chiang, returned safely to the capital this afternoon with advisor Donald. Several days ago, while traveling by car from Nanjing to Shanghai along the Nanjing-Shanghai Road, the rear tire of the car exploded, causing it to overturn into a ditch. Madame Chiang was thrown fourteen feet and remained unconscious for fifteen minutes. After examination by her doctor in Shanghai, it was determined that she suffered from shock and a strained muscle. Donald and one military officer were in the car with her that day. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

### Foreign Residents in Western Shanghai Rush to Evacuate

After the front lines shifted, the situation in the Shanghai western extra-settlement road area became tense. The sound of gunfire and cannons filled the air day and night, and stray bullets flew everywhere. British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Philips, immediately issued a notice, fearing that the war would expand and affect residents, advising Westerners to evacuate if necessary to avoid danger. Since yesterday (29th), Western residents living along Yih Ting Pan Road, Great Western Road, Yu Yuan Road, Route Tenant de May, and Route de Ghisenghien in western Shanghai have been rushing to evacuate. Suitcases and luggage filled the roads, one after another. Garrison troops, together with police officers, were on hand to take care of everything, so order was maintained.

### "North China Daily News" Reporter Inspects the Zhabei War Zone

A Scorched Earth, Beyond Description - Chinese Troops Took Everything With Them When They Withdrew

The "North China Daily News" published an article yesterday detailing the destruction observed by its reporter while touring the war zone in Zhabei. The main points are that the North Railway Station was the main target of the Japanese army's land and air bombardment, lasting for 75 days. The amount of ammunition used by heavy artillery and heavy bombers was incredibly enormous. Now, the Japanese flag flies high over the two railway bureaus, indicating the great victory of the Japanese army. However, Zhabei has become a scorched earth, and the scene of destruction is almost indescribable. The traces of artillery shells and bombs are everywhere. Looking around, it resembles the aftermath of an earthquake. The main feeling at this time is not about the withdrawal of the Chinese troops on Tuesday night, but how the Chinese troops were able to hold on for so long under such heavy pressure from the Japanese army. The Chinese army's defenses were extremely thorough and cleverly constructed, which explains why the Japanese army found it so difficult to attack and had to resort to even more severe measures in addition to street fighting. The article concluded by saying that the reporter did not see any abandoned war materiel or military supplies in the area he inspected. This proves that when the Chinese troops withdrew, they took everything of value with them, regardless of size.

### Enemy Planes Attack German Nationals

Japanese Consulate Has Apologized to Settle the Matter

On the afternoon of the 24th of this month, when enemy planes machine-gunned British troops on Route Ghisenghien, two German nationals traveling there were also affected. Japanese Consul-General Okamoto not only verbally apologized to German Consul-General Dr. Trautmann but also officially sent a letter of apology on behalf of his government. He also guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur in the future and was willing to compensate the victims for all losses. The German authorities were satisfied, so the case has been resolved satisfactorily.

### Indian Trade Union Federation Expresses Outrage at Japanese Atrocities

Boycotts Japanese Goods and Provides Assistance

The Municipal General Labor Union, because the Japanese invaders have invaded our country and massacred innocent people, has sent letters to the general labor unions of various countries, requesting them to launch economic sanctions to curb the atrocities. Yesterday, the union received a telegram from the Indian Trade Union Federation, stating that (omitted above) "All the people of India are extremely indignant at Japan's invasion of your country and the massacre of innocent people. At the same time, we express our utmost admiration for your country's heroic self-defense. We are now doing everything possible to assist your country's great war of national liberation. The president of our federation, Mr. Nehru, has already led all members in implementing a boycott of Japanese goods to curb the ambitions of the Japanese aggressors. Indian Trade Union Federation kowtows."

### Jincheng Shelter Establishes Printing Workshop

Accepts Commissioned Printing Work, Women Substitute for Sewing Clothes

The workshop is currently located in the Jincheng Shelter of the Xia Ling Peck Cinema at 742 Jing'an Temple Road. All sectors can go there to negotiate if they have commissioned printing work, which is also a way to help the refugees. It is also reported that the association also provides six of the shelter with work such as sewing padded vests and clothing for injured soldiers and refugees.

### Seamen's Union Calls for Sanctions Against Japan

Specifically Requests That the Belgian Branch Be Notified to Express Views at the Nine-Power Conference

The International Transport Workers' Federation is one of the world's most famous labor organizations and has considerable authority. The Chinese Seamen's Union, as a member state of the federation, specifically requests that the Belgian branch be notified to gather local workers at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and request the conference to resolve to impose effective sanctions against the brutal Japan, in order to attract the attention of the representatives of all countries. Furthermore, the San Francisco Seamen's Area Council in the United States led its affiliated seamen and dockworkers in a parade and demonstration on the 27th of this month when a Japanese mail ship arrived, implementing a boycott of Japanese goods. The union also sent a telegram of support. The two telegrams sent by the union are recorded below:

Telegram 1

As the signatory nations to the Nine-Power Treaty are holding a conference in Belgium, which is about to open, the Federation hopes that the members will come to an agreement for severe, effective, methods of sanction against Japan. This would diminish the human tragedy, it may even be invisible. However, if Japan's ambitions continue today, then the Chinese people will have no choice but to defend themselves and their survival, vowing to shed their last drop of blood to deal with them and ensure that they do not return with a single piece of armor.

### Shanghai Editors Association Declaration Demands Severance of Relations with Japan

Strengthen the External Expression of the Power of Non-Compromise, Fight for the Only Task of the Final Victory of the War of Resistance

The Shanghai Editors Association issued a declaration for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, demanding sanctions against Japan and severance of relations with Japan. The original text is as follows: "Dear elders, brothers, sisters, fellow countrymen, while our heroic soldiers on the front lines are defending the motherland with their blood and flesh, and while fierce battles against Japan are unfolding in the south and north, we deeply feel that the international community's understanding of our determination for this long-term, all-out war of resistance has not yet reached a thorough stage. The fact that the Sino-Japanese issue is still filled with an atmosphere of mediation on the eve of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is the best evidence. We know that the United Kingdom and the United States, one being the most powerful manipulator in the League of Nations and the other being the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty, the British authorities have repeatedly stated that the task of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is "mediation rather than punishment," and the United States has also stated that the purpose of this conference is primarily mediation. Even the United Kingdom suspects that "China may not be able to resist for so long and there will be no end in sight." This is still a major danger in the international community's view of our long-term war of resistance, and it is also a crisis that we should immediately overcome in our all-out war of resistance today. We want to solemnly inform the friendly countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference that our sacred national self-defense war, united by the whole country, is not only for the independence, freedom, and liberation of the Chinese nation, but also to safeguard the dignity of the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, and at the same time, it is also for the sake of world peace. Therefore, we accept participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in order to demand that all peace-loving countries give collective sanctions and stern punishment to the greatest culprit of disrupting world peace - Japanese imperialism. We oppose any mediation that infringes upon our territorial sovereignty, independence, and integrity. We especially oppose the Nine-Power Treaty Conference becoming a spoils-sharing conference for dividing China. At the same time, we also oppose the possibility of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference becoming the second non-interference committee on the Spanish issue. We believe in our government's determination to resist until the end, but in order to make people all over the world thoroughly understand our determination for self-defense war, to make those who advocate mediation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have no excuse, and to prevent the attempts of the smallest number of people in our country who seek to steal peace and compromise, we demand the immediate implementation of the severance of relations with Japan and the recall of all personnel from the embassy in Japan. We believe that only in this way can we strengthen the government's power to express non-compromise to the outside world, and it is precisely our only task to overcome the current crisis and strive for the victory after the war of resistance. Compatriots across the country, let us rise up, we must work together to demand sanctions against Japan and severance of relations with Japan from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference!"

### Foreign Far East Shipping Lines Still Finding it Difficult to Resume Sailing

Insurance Companies Refuse to Cover War Risk Insurance; All Parties Directly and Indirectly Suffer Losses

After the Shanghai battle, British and American Far East liners, such as those belonging to the Jardine Matheson and American President Lines, immediately suspended sailings to Shanghai. It has now been more than two months, and the direct and indirect losses suffered by the United Kingdom and the United States are enormous. In addition to the losses of these companies, British and American exporters' goods cannot be shipped to China, and at the same time, various Chinese products cannot be shipped out. It is difficult to accurately calculate the total losses. According to what this reporter learned yesterday, although the shipping companies intend to find ways to resume sailings, as a matter of prudence, they must purchase war risk insurance. However, since the outbreak of the war, insurance companies have generally refused to underwrite war risk insurance, so Far East shipping lines will temporarily still find it difficult to resume sailings.

### Letters of Thanks from Various Groups to the British Army for Saving Refugees

The Spirit of Benevolence and Chivalry Will Forever Be Engraved in the Hearts of Our Compatriots

The British Army stationed in Shanghai has provided much assistance in the work of rescuing refugees during our country's war of resistance. Especially on the 27th of this month, when groups of refugees from Zhabei sought refuge in the Shanghai Western District concession, the British troops stationed there all rose up to help. The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association sent a letter of thanks yesterday. The original letter was in English, and is translated as follows: To His Excellency Major General Smelly, Commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, in recent days, the scene of our Zhabei citizens, unable to bear the slaughter of the brutal Japanese army, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing to the Shanghai Western District concession, was extremely tragic and indescribable. At that time, the soldiers of your army, moved by righteous indignation, bravely assisted, supporting the old and weak, and guiding the young, so that they were able to cross the danger and enter safety, preserving their lives. This spirit of benevolence and chivalry will be forever engraved in the hearts of our compatriots. We hereby respectfully send this letter to express our gratitude, and please convey our heartfelt thanks to all the soldiers on the scene. With respectful regards, Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association. The Shanghai Local Association, learning that refugees in the Shanghai Western District were supporting the old and carrying the young, with nowhere to flee, and that the British Army stationed in the area had automatically provided assistance, carrying them on their shoulders and in their arms to safe areas, found their enthusiasm extremely admirable. The chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, Mr. Du Yuesheng, on behalf of all the citizens, sent a letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army stationed in the area, expressing his gratitude. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the British Defense Commander in Shanghai, saying, "We are writing to inform you that your command has provided great assistance to the people in the Shanghai Western District war zone who have fled into the concession, enabling the majority of these people to escape from danger. The Chamber of Commerce is extremely grateful for this spirit of chivalry and hereby expresses its thanks in a brief letter. We hope you will take note of this. To the British Defense Commander in Shanghai."

### Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Report

Yesterday a Fire Broke out at the Toyoda Cotton Mill; Twelve Fire Alarms the Day Before Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Council received a report at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stating that the Toyoda Cotton Mill in the British defense zone was on fire and burning, and that shrapnel had fallen in the Bailinan Road area of the defense zone.

The day before yesterday (the 28th), the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade lookout tower reported twelve fire alarms. The ambulance was dispatched nineteen times. A total of twenty-five patients were transported to various hospitals, sixteen of whom were injured by stray bullets or shrapnel, fourteen from the Western District and two from the Northern District. Fire trucks were called out four times.

### Random Notes from the War Zone (1)

— Geng Ya

"Going to the front line is not like being in Shanghai; you must listen to me. Drivers, pay attention to communication, but do not turn on your headlights indiscriminately. Lookouts, pay attention to airplanes and be careful not to lose anything on the truck. Whoever goofs off will let down his parents!" A former adjutant, who was escorting a large number of military supplies and was about to return to the front line, scanned the drivers standing around him with a bright flashlight and said very simply.

"This is a national matter; of course, we will never goof off!" The drivers answered in unison. Several even puffed out their chests and raised their hands, showing their extraordinary excitement.

With a few "toot-toot-toots," this team of trucks loaded with military supplies rumbled off to the front line. The reporter's car accompanied them. Another adjutant, Mr. Chen Shaowu, rode with me. It is said that he was a member of a certain crack troops that had come from the interior. Last night, he came to Shanghai to purchase electrical wire. He was troubled that he had nowhere to inquire late at night, but happened to meet a worker from the telephone bureau, who gladly volunteered to act as a guide, running around to help him complete the matter. Today, he bought a notepad at a store on Avenue Joffre. Unexpectedly, the boss was a foreigner with a high nose and blue eyes. After learning that he was "fighting the foreign devils," the foreigner gave him some relief items unexpectedly, amidst awkward and stammering compliments.

Mr. Chen had heard that Shanghai was the most snobbish and unwelcoming place, but at this moment, he encountered people who sympathized with him everywhere. Even foreigners gave him an unforgettable encouragement, which made him extremely happy.

He also said that before they set off, they had all received ideological inoculations. In other words, those who usually suffered from "Japanophobia" or had a vague understanding of the meaning of the war of resistance were dismissed early to prevent the bad influence of "one rat dropping spoiling the whole pot of soup." Those who are now going to the front line to fight are all determined "not to return alive without recovering lost territory." The day before yesterday, they had just reinforced a certain place, and a death squad, regardless of heavy casualties, had stubbornly recaptured the key position of Zhujiazhai. This was a small demonstration of their pure and vigorous morale.

From his accent, the reporter could tell that he was from a certain province, where there was a popular saying, "Leave home empty-handed, return home with wealth." This saying was very active in the minds of the average soldier. But now, the brave soldiers of this unit, who had come from afar to fight the Japanese, had transformed and embraced the determination "not to return alive without recovering lost territory." This could not be said to be a guarantee that "final victory will surely belong to us."

Mr. Chen parted ways in the middle of the journey. The reporter looked around and suddenly felt that the dangerous place they had passed through earlier—the sound of enemy and our troops charging and machine-gunning in front, and the deafening sound of our artillery in the rear—had been three days ago. The sound of artillery had moved far forward without a doubt, which meant that we had won the counterattack. However, we know that the journey of "protracted war of resistance" is very long and cannot be completed by fighting a few battles casually. Therefore, we are not proud of this kind of small victory. Perhaps small failures that are expected are about to follow. We should be even more courageous and fight the enemy to the end. Only in this way can we be sure of ultimate and greatest success!

Military transport was frequent along the way, and the journey took a long time. It was late at night when we arrived at a certain place in the direction of XX. At that time, the fog and dew were thick, and the earth was vast like a sea. Adjutant Huang passed through a sentry line and telephoned Mr. Lu, the deputy director of a certain military headquarters, to arrange a meeting with the reporter. There were many comrades and coolies there. They were really afraid that their elder brother, Adjutant Huang, would freeze. Like ants carrying food, they unloaded the mountain of military supplies from the trucks in no time.

Looking at the time, it would soon be dawn, so I decided to sit in the car and wait for daybreak, but I fell asleep without realizing it. Suddenly, I was awakened by a strong electric light. It turned out that the Boy Scouts who were taking care of the wounded soldiers were afraid that enemy planes would come to "drop eggs" and advised us to hide the car in the dark of night. Some of the Boy Scouts even played the Volunteer Army March on their harmonicas. On this autumn night with a slanting moon and dewy dew, hearing this passionate and tragic song, I felt an indescribable feeling in my heart!

The next day's breakfast was hosted by Director Lu. During the conversation, the gentlemen at the table talked about anecdotes from the war:

The enemy troops on the Liuhang line, because they landed four times, were all severely attacked by our army, making it impossible for them to gain a foothold, and they jumped into the Crystal Palace one after another! At the same time, the range of the enemy's naval guns was only thirteen or fourteen kilometers, while the range of our newest heavy artillery exceeded the range of the enemy's guns. This was a major blow to the enemy's ships. However, our artillerymen were very careful with their shells, aiming again and again before firing. They really wanted to hit the target every time before they were willing to fire with a loud roar. Therefore, the enemy troops recently dared not peek at Liuhang again. This is why they are "scared at the mere mention of it."

On the eve of the outbreak of the war, our highest military leader had predicted the ratio of enemy to our casualties, saying that "the ratio in the initial battle would be 2:1," but judging from the actual deaths and injuries in Liuhang, the enemy's huge death rate must be at least three times that of ours. Moreover, our defending troops at the mouth of Liuhang often saw enemy ships full of coffins constantly transporting them out. This was especially true after the fierce battle at Wenzaobang. According to statistics, at least 50,000 coffins have been transported out since the start of the war on August 13. Moreover, these ashes are from the collective cremation of thousands of corpses, which were then placed in a small number of boxes to be transported back to deceive people's eyes, so the exact number of deaths is even more than this.

The enemy troops started the war without a just cause, and they were repeatedly defeated. Their fear of death increased day by day. It goes without saying that soldiers with shallow knowledge believe in thousand-stitched vests or wear small Buddha statues, vainly seeking immortality. But the officers who attacked Zadian last time even carried grotesque and mythological protective flags. They are really not afraid of making the world feel that their so-called glorious and dignified imperial army is nothing more than "monsters and freaks!" (To be continued)

### The Enemy Troops Run Rampant in Zhabei

Committing Adultery, Rape, and Plunder with Impunity; A Batch of Women Were Burned Alive

According to workers who escaped from a certain flour mill on Yutong Road, after the enemy troops occupied Zhabei, they searched everywhere. Any young men who had not escaped were shot. Young women were all raped. Anyone who slightly resisted was shot to death. Moreover, they set fires everywhere and looted grain and money, so that the corpses of our people killed on the streets of Zhabei were everywhere to be seen. The brutal acts of the enemy troops were endless. The worker spoke with tears in his voice, and his grief was indescribable. It was also learned that after the enemy troops invaded Zhabei, they carried out a large-scale massacre of our innocent civilians. Even young children and the elderly were not spared. The cruelty was indescribable. What is even more infuriating is that the enemy troops escorted a batch of our women to the vicinity of the Macheng Road station the day before yesterday. First, they stripped off all their clothes, and then tied them up one by one with ropes, so that they could not move. Then, they poured kerosene all over their bodies and threw them into the fire to burn them. The cries shook the sky and the stench filled the air. Even in the border area of the Suzhou Creek, it could sometimes be smelled. The heartbreaking scene was unforgettable for us.

### Refugees in Shanghai's Western District Separately Resettled

Lacking Clothes for Cold Weather; Donations Urgently Needed

Since the Zhabei front changed and our army moved to a strong defense line, the concession side did not allow refugees to enter. After several negotiations by various agencies and groups, there were no results. Yesterday, Nie Haifan, deputy director of the Accommodation Group of the Refugee Relief Association, under the instructions of Chairman Pan, along with Municipal Council members Feng Bingnan, Lu Bohong, and Du Yuesheng, used their hard work, fearless spirit, and enthusiastic efforts to negotiate repeatedly with the concession authorities using diplomatic means. Finally, the concession authorities agreed. Therefore, from the 27th to the 29th, tens of thousands of homeless war zone refugees from Caojiadu, Daxilu, Haig Road, and the railway area were separately and properly settled. The weather has been getting colder in recent days, and these refugees have mostly escaped alone, urgently needing clothes for warmth. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously donate.

### The Italian Soldier Killed by the Japanese Was Buried Yesterday

Representatives from the United Kingdom and the United States Attended

Italian sailor Paituola was killed by enemy anti-aircraft shells in the defense area of Xiaoshadu Road a few days ago. Afterwards, the Italian military authorities protested to the Japanese side. The Japanese side has apologized to the Italian military authorities. The previous newspaper reported this. After the remains of the Italian soldier were moved to the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, technicians performed embalming surgery. At 2:15 p.m. yesterday, the remains were moved to the base on Jing'an Temple Road. The burial ceremony at 3:00 p.m. was similar to that of the British soldier who was killed on Kaixuan Road last time. Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Far East Naval Forces, Admiral Little, Commander of the British China Naval Forces, and representatives from the military and political authorities of various countries also attended at the time.

### There is Absolutely No Shortage of Food for the Citizens of Shanghai

Rice and Grain Transportation Certificates Must be Registered with the Regulatory Committee

After our army strategically withdrew from Zhabei, transportation on the Suzhou Creek from Caojiadu to the New Garbage Bridge was obstructed. The reporter recently inquired with the Municipal Food Regulation Committee about the food reserves of Shanghai citizens. According to the person in charge, the city has a large amount of grain reserves, and the rice shops also have very large reserves, which can maintain more than two months of food supply. Moreover, inland river rice can still be transported to Shanghai through other routes, so there is absolutely no shortage of food for the citizens. Although a small number of rice merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices, the committee, in addition to limiting prices from being arbitrarily exceeded, is also strictly preventing price increases. Once verified, it will be reported to the competent authorities for strict investigation.

After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce was approved by the Commander-in-Chief to print and issue transportation certificates to facilitate the transportation of commercial goods, hundreds of applications are received daily from various trade associations. Because the Municipal Food Regulation Committee is already handling the registration procedures for the transportation of rice, flour, bran, miscellaneous grains, and other goods, those who apply for transportation certificates for the above-mentioned goods in the future must first register with the Regulatory Committee before they can be issued. The Chamber of Commerce has already sent separate letters to various food-related trade associations to follow this procedure.

### The Municipal Party Headquarters Will Broadcast a Speech Today

The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city has scheduled Mr. Jiang Hao to give a speech on the Transportation Ministry's radio station at 4:30 p.m. today, entitled "The Organization of the Masses During Wartime." Citizens who are concerned about this issue should pay attention. The radio station's frequency is 1,300, call sign XOHC.

### The Cilian Association Pays Attention to the Nutrition of Child Refugees

In addition, children under the age of eight will be given a bowl of soybean milk every morning. It is stipulated that one catty of yellow soybeans should be ground into 25 bowls of soybean milk. Attention should be paid to cooking it thoroughly. The work of grinding soybeans should be done in shifts by the parents or family members of the children in order to improve their nutrition, health, and physique. This notice is hereby given."

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, on the 28th of this month, the department inspected 129 refugee accommodation centers, accommodating a total of 72,447 refugees. On the 28th, 143 refugees were vaccinated and 335 were injected with preventive medicine.

### Continued Hope for Donations of First Aid Kits

In the all-out war of resistance, our troops are bravely fighting and astonishing the world, but since a certain party came to Shanghai to pick up 300,000 first aid kits, the various armies have felt a shortage in their application. It is still hoped that people from all walks of life will maintain their previous enthusiasm and donate generously. Places to receive first aid kits: Jingtuan Temple, Guling Road; Cotton Cloth Trade Association, Zhoujin Lane; East Chuo Trade Association, Shilu, Beijing Road; Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce; Shanghai慰劳委员会; Shanghai Local Association.

### Yu Qiaqing Hospital's Deposits Allocated to Wounded Soldiers' Hospital

Designating Wang Xiaolai and Others to Handle

The Yu Qiaqing Hospital Preparatory Committee held its seventh preparatory committee meeting yesterday at the meeting place at 93 Guangdong Road. Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yaqin, Zhang Jiguang, Yu Qiaqing, and others attended. Wang Xiaolai chaired the meeting and Shen Wangyun recorded it. After the chairman reported, the discussion began. (1) Mr. Yu Qiaqing proposed that the funds deposited by the committee be allocated to the wounded soldiers' hospital in this port. It was resolved that Yu Lao's proposal was patriotic, loving the people, giving long life to others, and prolonging the world. The committee members admired it immensely. Therefore, the method was agreed as follows: A. When necessary, the deposited funds of more than 26,000 yuan will be added by Yu Lao to make up 30,000 yuan and allocated for the use of the wounded soldiers' hospital. B. Hospitals with excellent performance, complete equipment, and financial difficulties will be selectively lent to by the committee. C. The five committee members Wang Xiaolai, Jin Tingsun, Zhang Jiguang, Mao Heyuan, and Gu Yuqi are appointed to follow Yu Lao's instructions and decide on handling it at any time. D. In the future, these funds should be raised in full by the committee members to maintain the original plan.

### The International Relief Society Adds Two Accommodation Centers

Salvation Armies from Various Countries are Working Hard to Rescue Refugees

Since our army moved back from Dachang, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and other places, farmers in the war zones of Jiangwan, Dachang, Nanxiang, and Zhenru all fled to the concession from Caojiadu in Shanghai's Western District, and the number was very large. The International Relief Society of this city specially dispatched staff and Salvation Armies from various countries, and borrowed six cars from the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to drive directly to Caojiadu for rescue. Yesterday, more than 2,000 people were rescued and placed in the three accommodation centers set up by the association, which were already full and could no longer accommodate them. The association is now actively trying to add two accommodation centers and has selected an open space on Xiaoshadu Road and Macau Road as the fourth accommodation center, and an open space on Yanping Road as the fifth accommodation center, and has hired workers to start building reed sheds. It is also learned that the association yesterday also sent rice, steamed buns, bread, etc. by car to Shanghai's Western District to distribute to the refugees to fill their hunger.

### Procedures for Students of Municipal Schools to Reclaim Tuition Fees Due to Non-Attendance

As all schools in the city were preparing for the start of the semester, war broke out in the city, preventing normal school opening. The education authorities, considering the long-term war, decided students should not have their studies delayed, and stipulated temporary opening and enrollment measures. Now, most schools in the war zone have relocated to safer areas and reopened. Students who had pre-paid various fees before the war but were unable to attend classes have been permitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to reclaim their fees at the original payment locations with their receipts. However, for schools that entrusted the Municipal Bank of the city to collect tuition and construction fees, the bank requires a separate procedure before refunds can be issued. This has resulted in many families of students who did not enroll being unable to reclaim the fees they paid, causing them to travel back and forth in vain. After the Social Affairs Bureau learned of the situation, they negotiated a solution: all receipts stamped by the original school proving that the student did not attend classes will be refunded in full. Therefore, students who had pre-paid tuition and health fees to the Municipal Bank for municipal schools but did not enroll only need to request the original school to stamp their receipt as proof of non-attendance to reclaim the fees from the bank. Those who paid fees directly to the school can also reclaim them from the original school. If a reservation fee was paid but no tuition fee was collected, that reservation fee can also be reclaimed.

### Earnest Appeal of the First Special District Joint Association to Citizens on Four Points

Maintain Perseverance and Composure, Hold Firm to a Proactive Attitude; Prolonged Resistance Requires Restricting Consumption in the Rear

The First Special District Citizens' Joint Association, deeply concerned that citizens may misunderstand and believe rumors spread by traitors regarding the strategic retreat of our troops from Jiangwan and Zhabei as part of preparations for prolonged resistance and efforts to deplete the enemy's strength, earnestly appeals to citizens of all districts on four points: ㊀ Cope with abnormal situations like a patriotic citizen. ㊁ Constantly observe the surrounding environment for any traces of traitors and unscrupulous individuals, and report or earnestly correct any plotting of unlawful behavior. ㊂ If financially, mentally, or physically capable, participate in frontline or rear area support work to the greatest extent possible. ㊃ Everyone should deeply empathize with the soldiers fighting the enemy at the frontlines, and restrict all consumption in the rear to enable prolonged resistance and ensure the sustainability of individual livelihoods.

### Deployment of the Entire Frontline Completed, Our Second Line of Defense is Formidable

Enemy Attempt to Forcibly Cross the Suzhou Creek on the Right Flank Repelled by Our Forces; Central Route from Jiangqiao to Xiaonanxiang Completes a Vertical Line; Enemy Forces Bombarding Guangfu Position on the Left Flank, No Change

This newspaper received a frontline report this afternoon stating that the central and right flank units of our army, after gradually retreating southwest, the right flank units had completely moved to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek by the night before last (the 28th), from the southern end of the Fanhuaidu Railway Bridge to the new position at Yaojiadu. The central route, in order to cover the orderly movement of the right flank units, was still distributed along the arc-shaped line in the northeast of Jiangqiao Town, Yinzai (north of the Jinghu Road), Luoyang Bridge, and Wujiafen. In the past two days, they have been strictly blocking the enemy's advance on this line. Now that the right flank position has been stabilized, it began to withdraw west before dawn this morning, retreating to the line between Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao Town, completing a vertical line. At this point, the positions of our central and right routes have been completely stabilized, forming a parallel line with the left flank position in the future to contend with the enemy to the end. From last night to this afternoon, the enemy only used aircraft and artillery to bombard our left flank, in the Guangfu Town to Chengqiao Town area, attempting to destroy our fortifications. However, their infantry did not dare to advance lightly, so there was no fierce battle on this line. On the front of Luoyang Bridge and Yinzai, the enemy forces launched a fierce attack in two directions from last night, one attacking Luoyang Bridge along the Nanda Highway and the other invading Yinzai along the Jinghu Railway. Each used more than ten tanks to cover a large number of cavalry and infantry, advancing in a roundabout way. Our army also concentrated artillery fire, densely shooting, destroying many of their tanks and blocking the enemy's advance. Our frontline troops also fought bravely in different directions, and after fierce fighting until dawn this morning, they were ordered to retreat to the line between Xiaonanxiang and Jiangshu Town, relying on fortifications to defend. Also, on the south bank of Yaojiadu to the line of Zhoujiaqiao, the enemy forces on the north bank, under the cover of their artillery, also advanced in two directions, attempting to cross the river, one using tanks as a vanguard from the Zhenbei Road, intending to forcibly cross the river at Majiazhai and Huangjiazhai, directly reaching Beixinjing, and the other also using tanks as a vanguard from Zhongshan Road, hoping to seize our Zhoujiaqiao. Our army fiercely attacked from the south bank, and although the enemy repeatedly tried to build bridges and forcibly cross the river, they were eventually blocked by our artillery fire and retreated after suffering losses. Also, near the military surface of Zhongshan Road on the north bank, the enemy forces set up heavy machine gun positions, frequently sweeping the civilians who had not withdrawn from the south bank. In order to retaliate, our army erected several mortars on the roof of the Toyota Yarn Factory and suddenly launched a dense attack on the machine gun position. The enemy could not escape in time and two machine guns were destroyed. After a hasty retreat, they used artillery to bombard the Toyota Yarn Factory, resulting in eleven shells hitting it, immediately catching fire and burning it down. However, our side was prepared and withdrew the mortars before the enemy artillery bombardment, so apart from the factory being destroyed by them, we suffered no losses. At the moment, the line is still facing each other across the river.

### Bloody Battle on Zhen Da Road This Morning

Enemy Suffers More Than Four Hundred Casualties, Flees in Disarray; We Capture Five Small Steel Cannons and More Than Twenty Rifles

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1:00 PM on the 30th that a battle for position broke out again on Zhen Da Road at 3:30 AM this morning. The enemy used more than twenty tanks to cover 5,000 enemy soldiers, attacking south along the highway, from Xujiazhai Nanku to Jijiazhai, Panzhai, and Daijiazhai. The fire line was about two kilometers long. The two sides fought fiercely for three hours. At dawn, our army launched a frontal attack on the enemy from the highway, driving the enemy back. At the same time, the left and right flanks coordinated their advance, pressing the enemy into retreat. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 400 casualties and we captured five small cannons and more than twenty rifles.

### Enemy Attacks Guangfu, Bombardment Continues

Fortifications Slightly Damaged, Quickly Repaired; Our Army Charges North of Caowang Temple, Repelling the Enemy

A Central News Agency war correspondent in Guangfu reported at 10:00 AM on the 30th that the enemy's attack on Guangfu was increasingly urgent. From 2:00 AM to 6:00 PM yesterday, they bombarded continuously, firing more shells than at any time in the past ten days. Part of our fortifications were destroyed, but after our army repaired them under fire, they were quickly restored to their original condition. At about 2:00 PM, about several hundred enemy soldiers charged our right flank position, reaching as many as five times, but they were all repelled by us. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and we captured one prisoner.

A Central News Agency war correspondent in Guangfu reported at 10:00 AM on the 30th that at 2:00 AM this morning, more than a hundred enemy soldiers, under the cover of artillery, attacked our Zhao Jiaqiao position north of Caowang Temple. Our army responded calmly and launched a trench charge, driving the enemy back before dawn.

### Our Position at Luoyang Bridge Moves West

Forms a Straight Line from Xiaonanxiang to Jiangqiao

The Jiangqiao Town to Nanxiang position, especially the Luoyang Bridge section, was too prominent, which was extremely unfavorable militarily. Therefore, it was moved backward last night until before dawn this morning, so that it formed a vertical line with Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao Town to facilitate attack and defense coordination. The enemy was completely unaware when our army moved back. This morning, they were still bombarding fiercely, but there was absolutely no damage to our fortifications. Luoyang Bridge is a transportation route between Zhenru and Nanxiang, with a gravel road leading northeast to Dachang, which can be used by cars, tanks, and baggage. After the enemy occupies this place, it will undoubtedly serve as a transportation center.

### Enemy Forces Bombard the Toyota Yarn Factory

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1:00 PM on the 30th that the Toyota Yarn Factory facing the enemy forces west of Zhongshan Road on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek was originally built with strong fortifications, and our army is now stationed there, making it one of the important strongholds. Last night, the enemy forces concentrated mortar fire on the area, with more than ten shells hitting, destroying part of it and starting a fire that burned part of it. After we rearranged it, it was unusually strong.

### Our Army Strengthens Defenses on the Huangpu River

Two Enemy Planes Bomb Villages, Tragically Killing More Than Ten Civilians

The Pudong area has returned to calm after three violent artillery battles the night before last. Only sporadic machine gun fire could be heard from the enemy ships on the Huangpu River near the Qichang Wharf last night, as a precaution against our army's attack. Otherwise, the entire line passed in silence until dawn. Our army is now strengthening its defenses along the Huangpu River, and it will be extremely difficult for the enemy to achieve their goals.

Two enemy planes flew over Weijiazhai, east of Zhangjialou in Pudong, yesterday evening and dropped seven or eight heavy bombs, completely destroying more than thirty farmhouses in the entire village. Four or five men and women were killed on the spot, and six or seven men and women were crushed to death. Those injured include Yang Shunfa, Shen Ronggen, Fei Lu's, Fei Damei, Shen Ruiren, Shen Meilai, Fei Zilin, and Sun Jingen, totaling more than ten people.

### Stray Bullets Flying in the Western District of the Concession

Yesterday (the 29th) from 4:15 PM to 10:00 PM, the artillery battles were quite fierce near the British military defense zone in western Shanghai. Three soldiers of the British Royal Ulster Rifles were killed by bullets, and two were injured. Shrapnel fell at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yuyuan Road and near Bailinan Road. Seven shells flew into the Columbia Road area. One shell hit the house at 1475 Yuyuan Road, and another hit 415 Daxilu Road. Shells also exploded near the Suzhou Creek on Jessfield Road. Five shells flew into the section of Lujia Road near Haig Road.

### The Concession Consular Body's Defense Committee Convened to Discuss Concession Protection Issues

The Concession Consular Body's Defense Committee held a meeting yesterday at the Municipal Council Building on Jiangxi Road, attended by consuls from Britain, the United States, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and other countries. The meeting's content was to discuss protection issues within the western Shanghai and Weihaiwei Police Station areas. The Bureau decided to entrust the full authority for the defense of the concession to the Southern Army Commander Sima Yilai and the Director-General of the Municipal Council Fei Xindun as Chief and Deputy Director, responsible for command.

### Eight Hundred Isolated Soldiers Resolutely Fighting, Repelling the Enemy Twice This Morning

Commander Xie Sends Letters to Division Commander Sun and Deputy Division Commander Feng, Saying That They Will Never Sacrifice Easily Before Achieving Their Mission

Our brave soldiers of the 88th Division's Xie Regiment and Yang Battalion, who have been holding the Sihang Warehouse at the Guangfu Road entrance on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, have persisted for four days and four nights. Although the enemy has done everything they can and used every trick, they have not been able to harm our soldiers in the slightest, let alone our fortress. Starting at dawn this morning, countless Chinese and foreigners went to admire them, and the traffic on Xinzha Road was blocked. Reporters also arrived early in the morning and watched from across the river. They saw our national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flying on the top of the Sihang Warehouse and the top of the Mainland Warehouse, making it even more brilliant. Our eight hundred soldiers were all safe in the warehouse, with calm attitudes. The surrounding fortifications were even more solid. On the south bank of the river and on the new Garbage Bridge, there were also more than a dozen foreign officers watching from the railings. The enemy forces were huddled in the Shanghang Bank warehouse on the western end, and more than a dozen enemy soldiers were lurking in the enemy fortifications, frequently firing scattered rifle bullets at our Sihang Warehouse. But our army calmly ignored them. Then the enemy continued with machine guns and box guns to provoke us. Only then did one or two of our soldiers push open the windows facing the river for a reconnaissance and quietly observe the changes in the enemy's forces. However, the enemy did not notice it. At about 11:00 AM, more than a dozen enemy soldiers suddenly crawled out of their fortifications, seemingly wanting to take the opportunity to launch a sneak attack. Unexpectedly, they were seen by our soldiers at the window, and as soon as the enemy took a step, they fired rifles. After only a few shots, the enemy fled in panic and hid in their fortifications, frantically firing machine guns at us, as if they were afraid of being chased by us. The scene of panic and loss of composure was laughable. Not long after, we saw the previous dozen or so enemy soldiers take off their uniforms and wipe sweat frequently with towels. Presumably, they were exhausted and covered in sweat after this performance. Afterwards, the enemy soldiers hid and did not come out, but instead fired rifles at the onlookers standing on the south bank, as if wanting to vent their shame and anger. Fortunately, no one was hit.

Hand Grenades Defeat Enemy Tanks

The enemy's several charges on the Sihang Warehouse all failed, and many were killed by our army. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy dared not advance further and slowly advanced several tanks from behind the sandbags they had placed. The isolated soldiers guarding the warehouse pretended not to see them. When the tanks advanced to a considerable distance, they suddenly concentrated and fiercely bombarded them with dozens of hand grenades. Seeing the situation was bad, the enemy fled in a panic. This morning, the enemy changed tactics again, gradually moving the sandbags placed on the west side of the Sihang Warehouse closer to the east, and the enemy soldiers lying behind the sandbags used a small grenade fired from a rifle to bombard the walls of the warehouse, and a hole was indeed broken. But our heroic isolated army used the hole to set up a building barrier gun. After a fierce counterattack, the enemy immediately hid behind the sandbags and dared not move, but only fired rifles aimlessly.

Enemy's Dawn Attack Collapses

Since dawn this morning, the enemy forces concentrated their firepower to attack our heroic isolated army. For a time, the sound of gunfire was unusually intense, but our army was exceptionally calm. When the enemy approached, they fiercely counterattacked with machine guns and hand grenades. The enemy could not escape and more than a dozen people fell to the ground after being shot. The remaining enemy soldiers also retreated in disarray to the Jiaotong Bank godown and defended themselves on the rooftops. Until about 7:00 AM, the sounds of machine guns and rifles from both sides were still firing at each other. However, our army's bullets were fired from above and often hit the enemy's vital points.

Repeated Attacks Still Fail

Since about 7:00 AM, the enemy forces gradually showed signs of being unable to withstand it, so they changed their strategy. One side attacked the rear of our army from the side of Wuzhen Road, but before they approached our station, they were shot down by machine gun bullets again. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy stopped attacking. At this point, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided. Later, at about 8:00 AM, two enemy planes suddenly flew to the sky above Wuzhen Road and circled around. Three minutes later, they fled east. At about 11:00 AM, the sound of gunfire broke out again. Our isolated army still responded calmly, and more than a dozen enemy soldiers were shot and killed.

Enemy Sets Up Steel Cannons to Bomb the Warehouse

Starting at 6:00 AM today, the enemy forces set up several small steel cannons on the Guoging Road side, preparing to bombard the Sihang Warehouse. However, the buildings in that area are all steel and concrete, and our army has piled up sandbags around them, so this action of the enemy will definitely not have any impact on our heroic isolated army.

The Central News Agency said that the eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers of our army in Zhabei, who are isolated and defending to the death, have won the admiration of Chinese and foreigners. It is learned that Commander Xie, who commands these eight hundred heroes, has now sent two more letters to Division Commander Sun and Deputy Commander Feng, saying that they will never sacrifice easily before completely accomplishing their mission. After the mission is completed, they will make a heroic sacrifice, which is extremely tragic, commendable, and tearful. Also, Division Commander Sun's letter to Mr. Du Yuesheng, expressing his gratitude for the donations of materials from all walks of life, is also extremely important. The three letters are recorded separately below.

Commander Xie's Letter to Division Commander Sun

Division Commander, may this find you well,

Your subordinate, with the determination to sacrifice, respectfully follows your intentions and fights to the end. Before completely accomplishing the mission, I will never sacrifice easily. Success or death, I have carefully considered it. I will certainly not fail your intentions, seek temporary ease, mislead the country and the people, and fail your trust. All publicity and news from the outside world are transmitted from outside. Your subordinate has never made any requests or talks to the outside world at this time. Having the determination to die, I have no thoughts other than accomplishing the mission. The entire fortification, after three days and nights of construction, has reached the intended level. If the enemy attacks, they will certainly not succeed. According to the reports of the watchtowers, the results of the enemy's attack on the 27th resulted in more than eighty enemy deaths. Yesterday (the 28th) at around 6:00 AM, your subordinate personally sniped and killed two enemy soldiers, and the people in the concession watching applauded and cheered. Now your subordinate's aim is to make a heroic sacrifice after the mission is completed. I beg you to release your thoughts.

Your subordinate, Xie Jinyuan, respectfully, October 29, 10:00 AM.

Commander Xie's Letter to Deputy Division Commander Feng

Deputy Division Commander, may this find you well,

Now your subordinate is determined to die for the country. Within the limited time, the mission will be achieved, and I will never retreat easily. Whether now or in the future, I will never make any plans to seek a moment of survival. The Division Commander and the country have treated your subordinate well, and I should work even harder to fight the Japanese pirates for a long time. Internally, we are actively strengthening closed fortifications. Everything has a detailed plan. Before your subordinate seeks sacrifice, the entire battalion of officers and soldiers will definitely ask the Japanese pirates for a considerable price. Please forward your subordinate's intention to the Division Commander, and I will not fail the mission.

Your subordinate, Jin Yuan, respectfully, October 29, 12:00 PM.

Division Commander Sun's Letter to Chairman Du

Division Commander Sun Yuanliang's letter to Local Collaboration Association Chairman Du Yuesheng regarding thanks to all circles for donating goods reads:

Chairman Yue Sheng, great greetings,

Recently, I heard that people from all walks of life in Shanghai are comforting one regiment of our army who are defending Zhabei to the death, and the goods are very many. I am very grateful, but the goods are not only difficult to transport, but also do not meet the needs, and are too piled up, making them very easy to rot. Fighting against the war is the duty of soldiers. Success or death are originally not different paths. Please ask Mr. to convey to all circles that there is no need to donate. If it is difficult to decline, it is best to buy national salvation bonds, or donate cash, as pensions for national anti-Japanese sacrificed officers and soldiers, so as to avoid waste and be practical.

Sun Yuanliang, October 30.

### Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Newspaper Reporters to Shanghai to Seek Contact with News Circles of Various Countries

And to Investigate the International Situation in Shanghai; Enemy Increases Troops in Large Numbers, Attempting to Attack in Two Directions

According to reports: ㊀ In order to investigate the international situation in China and to win over the news circles of various countries in Shanghai, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specifically sent more than 20 reporters from the Hochi Shimbun, etc., including Masao Konan, to Shanghai on the 27th of this month to carry out activities. They are now staying at the Donghe Foreign Firm on Peng Road and have established a joint office in the Cathay Hotel to engage in activities with diplomatic officials and naval and land officers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, etc., and to contact news circles of various countries. ㊁ The enemy troops in the Dachang and Zhabei areas have been transferred to Yangshupu, Wusong Road, Jiaxing Road, and other places to rest, and the newly added 12th Division has taken over the defense of Dachang, and the 29th Brigade of the 3rd Division and the 10th Naval Landing Force have taken over the defense of Zhabei.

㊂ The enemy forces plan to attack Nanxiang on one side, directly to Kunshan, and to attack Zhenru fiercely on the other, advancing to Zhongshan Road, and decide to use a large number (reported to be about 70,000) of army, equipped with 70 machine guns, 75 tanks, and 21 heavy artillery pieces, to launch an attack. It is also learned that the attacking enemy army will issue three large cakes to each person, which can provide food for three days.

㊃ The enemy side continued to arrive with 11 warships yesterday afternoon, carrying approximately 40,000 enemy soldiers.

㊄ The enemy forces abandoned the fortifications in the area of Henan Road and Shuidian Road and arranged defensive positions as the second line of defense.

### The Tyrannical Japanese Can't Bear the Burden, Eagerly Willing to Cease Fire in Shanghai

Will Concentrate All Efforts on North China; Our Country Will Never Fall for Their Trick

A Reuters dispatch from London on the 30th via the Central News Agency reported that according to reliable sources, Japan is now eagerly willing to cease fire in Shanghai. The Japanese warlords are also gradually becoming anxious and uneasy about Japan's huge burden in North China. It is widely believed that China will definitely not agree to a ceasefire in Shanghai, because this move will allow Japan to focus its efforts on North China. A member of a certain important country's parliament said to a Reuters reporter that he believed that Japan's consumption was very high and its strength was declining, and other countries were very happy about it. If Japan is aware of this, then the best opportunity for peace has arrived. As for China's amazing recovery power, it is well known. At the same time, military observers are paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese conflict, and now they are praising the Shanghai Chinese army's skillful retreat and the order of its alignment, and they believe that the Chinese army's new position is more solid than the old one, and it will be even more difficult for the Japanese army to break through it.

### The Presidents of Four Universities Telegraph the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Urging the Adoption of Collective Measures

Bombing Universities Destroys Culture; Threatens Peace and Should be Punished

Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University, jointly with Weng Zhirong, President of Shanghai Tongji University, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, and He Bingsong, President of Jinan University, etc., telegraphed the representatives of the countries party to the Nine-Power Treaty meeting in Beijing, requesting them to uphold justice and impose sanctions on Japan. The telegram has been sent. The original telegram stated: "We urgently plead (request the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to adopt strong and effective collective measures to stop Japan's aggression against China, and to punish Japan for destroying international law and treaties, deliberately bombing universities and other cultural centers, and threatening world peace and culture."

### Brief Comments

— Xiang

Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet government commented that convening the conference to stop illegal and sinful adventurism is both clumsy and useless. On the contrary, if the countries directly involved can act in concert, that will be sufficient. This is a sharp and insightful comment. I am deeply disappointed by the various circumstances leading up to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was originally scheduled for the 25th, then changed to the 30th, and then to November 3rd. The severity of the situation has reached a critical point, yet they deliberately delay and procrastinate. This is the first disappointment. Before the meeting even started, various countries declared their positions. One says to provide spiritual assistance, another says to condemn morally, and yet another says to mediate the Far East dispute using peaceful methods, fearing to offend the mad god of war and bring disaster upon themselves. This kind of fearful attitude determines that there will be no positive results. This is the second disappointment. Furthermore, looking at all kinds of conferences in recent years, which one has achieved unexpected effectiveness?

"So, the practical issue of mobilizing the masses is what worries all parties, both government and public. At the very first step of starting this work, some people are worried about the issue of leadership. This cannot be said to be a reef in the future." — Me.

"Leadership, I don't think it should be a problem!" Mr. Chen said excitedly. "This is a matter of life and death for the entire Chinese nation, an extremely dangerous situation! If, unfortunately, there is a military failure in the final stage! Looking at the current situation, if it really fails, the upper level will be the enemy's rule, and the lower level will be a large number of traitors. In addition, there will be a crowd of people living in complacency. Beyond that, there will be nothing else! At that time, may I ask, what leadership is there! What can be led!"

"The facts are indeed so. But what I said is also the actual situation recognized by all parties. The current urgent problem is: how to effectively mobilize the broad masses!" — Me.

"I think the masses should mobilize themselves! It seems unnecessary to first ask who will lead!" — Mr. Chen.

"That's right. At present, theoretical exploration is already sufficient; the most necessary thing is to do it practically. This approach must be effective; moreover, it must be accepted and trusted by all parties. According to the news we have received, various parties are already conceiving action plans for this approach." — Me.

"However, no matter what approach is taken, to achieve significant results, it must be integrated with the lives of the masses. Although some people may suspect this; but in fact, unless the concepts of loving the country and loving the nation are unified with their own interests, then the masses will not be mobilized." — Mr. Chen.

One of the gentlemen present, who had been listening attentively, roused himself from deep thought at this moment. He straightened his collar, nodded, and said: "Absolutely right! Absolutely right! This is the conclusion drawn from Mr. Chen's long-term work experience!"

The conversation had lasted for more than an hour and a half. The serious atmosphere relaxed slightly. We asked about Mr. Chen's health.

"Very good! Very good!" Mr. Chen replied with a smile; and his spirited complexion, together with his words, answered our question.

We also asked if his actions were restricted. He immediately declared:

"Everything is very free. There is nothing of that sort here."

Mr. Chen and the three colleagues from our newspaper each took several photos in turn. At the time of parting, he repeatedly exhorted:

"Today's conversation — today's conversation —." We keenly felt his boundless concern.

Mr. Chen probably didn't want his conversation to be misconstrued as violating the various highest principles that the whole of China has tacitly accepted. — This thought, like after visiting other celebrities, surfaced in my mind again at this moment.

### Japanese Warships Blocked Zhongshan City, All Shops Have Resumed Business

European and American Goods Replace Enemy Goods; HSBC Bank Sets Up an Office

Shantou Correspondence: Since the enemy's Third Fleet blockaded the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, three to five enemy warships often patrol outside the port of Shantou, taking turns on guard, intercepting our country's sailing boats and fishing boats, and questioning foreign ships entering and leaving Shantou. The coasts of Nan'ao and Chaoyang have been attacked by enemy warships several times, but the losses are minimal, and our military defenses are also extremely tight. Therefore, the morale of the Chaoshan people is becoming more stable day by day. Shops that have resumed business in Shantou City account for nine out of ten. Army Commander Li Hanhun has also issued an order to all counties and towns in the Chaoshan region, stipulating that all shops that have not resumed business must resume business by October 30, otherwise all goods will be auctioned off, and the proceeds will be used to purchase national salvation bonds, or the owners will cancel their leases and rent them to others for business. The order in Shantou City is excellent, and air defense facilities have also been completed. There are currently one British and one American warship in the port of Shantou. Our military is stepping up protection for foreigners, churches, hospitals, and schools. Foreign firms have greatly increased their import and export of goods, rising to replace the power of Japanese goods. The Taiwan Bank, established by the enemy in Shantou, has stopped operating. HSBC Bank has sent people to Shantou to set up an office to assist European and American businesses and develop in the Chao and Mei areas. Passenger and cargo ships on regular routes to Southeast Asia and Hong Kong are more crowded than ever before.

### Tomorrow is the Deadline for Qianzhuang to Handle Loan Extensions

Exchange Notes and Pay Interest for Those Due; New Loans Temporarily Suspended Due to the Inability to Recover Old Loans

Tomorrow is the tenth period for Shanghai's industry and commerce. At this time of our country's all-out war of resistance, although Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) are routinely urging industrial, commercial firms, and companies that have borrowed long-term credit to repay when due, borrowers are all affected by the war and cannot repay as scheduled, requesting accommodation to extend the deadline to the end of April next year. Qianzhuang, in view of the actual difficulties, have agreed to extend the deadline, but they must exchange extension notes and pay the previous period's interest. The above extension procedures were originally scheduled to be handled tomorrow, but as it is Sunday, a holiday for Qianzhuang, they will be postponed to one day. At the same time, because Qianzhuang cannot recover loans, they have had to temporarily suspend all new loans. As for the deposits of Qianzhuang shareholders, they are all settled at the interbank rate of five yuan and five jiao, as agreed upon by the trade association. Yesterday, the market's foreign exchange interbank rate was one jiao and five fen, which was very stable, which is very different from the seven jiao rate in previous years.

Wartime Youth, 26th Issue

### Dedicated to the Soldiers Defending Zhabei

— Ai Qun

A message to you, loyal and brave warriors, surrounded on all sides!

We respectfully admire and revere you with the greatest revolutionary salute!

This time you have struggled for a long time to defend Greater Shanghai.

But you disregarded military tactics and bravely resisted as an isolated army!

You have stirred up a huge wave of national resistance!

You have fought for the long-suppressed glory of roaring,

This is the first page in the history books,

Because you regard your great lives as insignificant as ants,

The whole world sheds tears of heroic sympathy for you!

The weak nations of the world also mournfully break their hearts with courageous enthusiasm!

Listen! All nations are praising the skills of the heroes,

Look! The world admires your thoughts,

The enemy is terrified!

The dwarf devils have shattered their brains!

We will not be slaves:

We want to let the Chinese nation shine brightly!

We will not enter the concessions:

We are willing to be trapped to death on the national defense line!

Although there is only this last drop of blood left!

It has been sprinkled all over the East Asian battlefield of all-out war of resistance,

We will spare no effort to look forward to the final victory,

And sing the song of triumph together.

### The Youth of the Soviet Union (1)

— Liu Yucai

The Soviet Union government pays special attention to the training of youth, especially young students, and educates them with a kind of political education. Therefore, young men and women from the age of ten to sixteen are organized into a kind of youth group, and they are guided by the Youth Party. The number of people in this kind of youth group is now more than four million. They have so-called five proverbs and five laws to teach them how to behave.

The so-called five proverbs are:

(1) Adhere to all healthy actions, with great joy; adhere to the habit of getting up early and doing exercises.

(2) Save time and act quickly.

(3) Be diligent, persevering, and patient, and always abide by the actions of the group. In any situation, one should have a coping strategy.

(4) Maintain everyone's property: one should value one's books, clothes, and work area.

(5) Never curse people, and be careful to abstain from drinking and smoking.

This is an aim of the Soviet Russian youth education, but it is also a very interesting organization.

There is also another kind of youth group, which is an organization for people over the age of fourteen; there are more than five million members in it.

These two kinds of youth groups also bear some social missions. For example, when they are riding on a streetcar, they are doing the work of cracking down on people riding without tickets and checking tickets. Or sometimes, they run to the countryside to supervise the planting and harvesting of farmers. Lenin once designated this kind of group as the Soviet Russian Navy Protection Group, and later designated them as the protectors of the Soviet Russian Air Force.

The leading figures of the Soviet Union, in the guidance of the Youth Party in their own country, especially advocated the patriotic movement. Two years ago in May, when the Youth Party advocated the highest law of life, the so-called patriotism and the spirit of loving one's hometown aroused great enthusiastic discussion among general administrators and newspapers and magazines. Taking advantage of the disaster suffered by the Soviet Russian Arctic exploration ship Chelyuskin, they aroused the enthusiasm of the people for the rescue movement and started a fierce patriotic movement.

The advocacy of this kind of patriotic movement, the so-called patriots who love the Soviet Russia, have a spirit of mutual love for their motherland, language, and people. At the same time, each person gives play to his own talents and accomplishes great things for the country together. They are doing their best to avoid any actions that are detrimental to the Soviet Russia. Based on this proposition, those in power seize various opportunities to cultivate the patriotism of the general public. What is worth paying attention to is that they are working hard to make many audio films about the Chelyuskin rescue movement and audio films of sports competitions. The use of these things to give the people excitement and stimulation is nothing more than wanting to use these opportunities to cultivate the people's patriotism.

Their method of reward is to give various medals, badges, and titles. Among them, the title of "Hero of the Soviet Russia" is the most noble honor. This is a reward method that was only established two years ago in April. As for the rewards in sports, the title of "Meritorious Athlete" is the best. These titles, medals, and badges are all for rewarding and encouraging these patriots.
