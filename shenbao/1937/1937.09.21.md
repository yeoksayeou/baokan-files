### Luo Dian Still in Our Army's Hands, Main Force Battle to Unfold in a Week

Enemy Suffers Three Crushing Defeats and Begs for Aid from Home Four Times - Our Fortifications are Solid, Morale is High, Preparing for a Decisive Blow - Enemy Advances on Liu Hang from Two Directions Yesterday Morning Were Repelled

The enemy forces recently suffered a severe beating from our forces in Luo Dian and Liu Hang, losing their offensive capability. They are now awaiting reinforcements and supplies. A major battle between the two main forces may not occur again until a week later. Moreover, Luo Dian is currently still in our army's hands, and there are absolutely no enemy troops in Liu He. The enemy forces in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas have also made no progress. Our first line of defense is extremely solid and can definitely be held for a long time. These were the key points of a conversation between a certain Commander-in-Chief at the front lines and a reporter from the Central News Agency. The reporter left Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday, heading to the headquarters of the ×× Army, returning to Shanghai around 7:00 PM. During the several hours at the army headquarters, apart from meeting with a certain Commander-in-Chief at the headquarters at 4:00 PM, he also met with many important military officers. In recent days, due to the enemy's rout, the front lines have been relatively quiet, allowing the military officers to dedicate more time to providing the reporter with detailed accounts of the recent front-line situation.

Luo Dian Still in Our Hands - Absolutely No Enemy Troops in Liu He

When the reporter met with a certain Commander-in-Chief, he first declared that the news of Luo Dian's fall was inaccurate. According to him, the enemy forces landed in Luo Dian a month ago. Except for an initial attempt to advance, which was repelled by us, they have been consistently surrounded and pressured by us. Only after our right-wing troops retreated to the first line of defense and the enemy's rear positions expanded slightly did they significantly reinforce Luo Dian and make every effort to attack. However, after a week of fierce fighting, our troops retreated and advanced repeatedly, persisting with renewed vigor, defeating the enemy's main force and firmly holding their original positions. Currently, the southeast and west three sides of Luo Dian are still controlled by our main forces. The enemy forces only hold the northeast position of the Hantong rear area. However, the town of Luo Dian has now been reduced to ashes, with not a single intact building. As for Liu He, the enemy has repeatedly dispatched troops from Luo Dian to harass the area, but they have all been repelled by our forces. There are absolutely no traces of enemy troops there now.

Enemy Forces Severely Beaten by Us - Main Force Battle Still Pending

In the past week, during the fierce fighting in Luo Dian, the enemy used even stronger forces to attack our army's positions in the Liu Hang area, aiming to complete a central breakthrough strategy before September 18th to cut off our entire line of communication. When our troops retreated from Yang Hang to avoid the threat of enemy naval gunfire, they had already assembled heavy troops in the positions before Liu Hang. Therefore, although the enemy attacked with its main force and fought desperately, our troops were well-equipped and ready, waiting in full battle array. After a week of fierce fighting, on the 17th, the enemy's main force was broken by us, leaving corpses strewn across the field and retreating in disarray. The scale of the defeat was unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battle. Our army's positions, however, remained steadfastly unmoved. Currently, the enemy forces are reorganizing their remnants and requesting a fourth round of reinforcements from home. It is reported that a small part has arrived today. It is expected that the enemy will launch another major offensive in about a week at the earliest. Therefore, the front lines have been relatively quiet in the past two or three days, with only occasional minor skirmishes.

Zhabei Possesses Great Strength - Enemy Forces Dare Not Advance

The reporter asked a certain Commander-in-Chief whether it was true that, as reported in various foreign newspapers, our army's strength in the Zhabei area was very weak and that there were no fortifications to defend. He replied with a smile that such reports were completely rumors spread by the enemy. The truth is quite the opposite. In the Zhabei area, after our army abandoned its offensive strategy, the enemy forces repeatedly harassed us but never dared to engage in a major battle. The enemy also knows deeply that if they attack with their main force, they will only pay a heavy price and will definitely not achieve any results. In short, our army is determined to resist to the death and will not easily give up an inch of land. In the Pudong area, our army also has solid fortifications to defend and will not allow the enemy to land.

Entire Line of Fortifications Solid - Absolutely Can Be Held for a Long Time

The reporter also asked whether the enemy had any possibility of achieving a central breakthrough strategy to cut off our army's communication. According to him, since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, the enemy has been determined to fight a quick war, attempting to end the war early with a central breakthrough strategy. However, the enemy must now realize that this is just a dream. Although the entire front line is long, all battles are purely village-grabbing battles. Often, in a single day, there are advances and retreats, with the only objective being to fight over a single village. Our army is advancing step by step, consolidating its positions, and it is impossible to affect the overall situation by disturbing one part. Moreover, our entire line has been planned in advance, the fortifications are extremely solid, and we firmly believe that we can hold out for a long time and inflict serious damage on the attacking enemy forces.

Enemy Casualties Exceed 10,000 - Our Army Also Suffers Sacrifices

Regarding the number of enemy troops fighting in Shanghai, according to reliable reports he obtained, in addition to the naval marines, the army has six divisions, totaling twelve brigades. Each division is organized for wartime, so the actual number of troops is 150,000. After 40 days of fierce fighting, the enemy's casualties are estimated to be between 15,000 and 16,000, with the battles at Zhang Huabang, Qiujiang Wharf, Yang Hang, Liu Hang, and Luo Dian being the most devastating. As for our army's sacrifices, the reporter personally reviewed the casualty reports of various units, which were far less severe than those of the enemy. A certain Commander-in-Chief finally spoke about the strength of the two armies, saying that although the enemy's weapons are more sophisticated than ours, our army's high morale and courage in combat are far beyond what the enemy can match. Currently, our army is adopting a steady and solid approach, implementing a long-term attrition strategy, and the future of the resistance war is very optimistic. Regarding the benefits of retreating to the first line of defense, he said that in addition to avoiding the threat of enemy naval gunfire, it can also adjust our army's positions. In the past, the front lines were intertwined, making it extremely difficult to coordinate. Especially in the downtown area, our army had to defend against the enemy forces in Yangshupu on one side and monitor the enemy forces in Zhang Huabang on the other, making our army face a dangerous situation of standing back-to-back. After achieving the goal of depleting the enemy's strength, we should make urgent adjustments.

### Enemy Attack on Liu Hang Repelled by Our Forces

To Threaten Our First Line of Defense - Our Forces Intercept and Annihilate Many Enemy Troops in Separate Attacks

After the enemy's plan to attack Luo Dian failed, they changed their target the night before last, invading Liu Hang in an attempt to make a central breakthrough and threaten our first line of defense. The area is located between Luo Dian and Dachang, a major town on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Our army had made preparations early and stationed heavy troops there. The enemy launched an attack from two directions starting at 10:00 PM the night before last (the 19th). One part launched a fierce attack on our Wu Zhai position, north of Liu Hang, but made no progress after being met with a head-on counterattack. On the other hand, an extremely elite unit, under the cover of several armored vehicles, launched a fierce attack on our warning line at Chao Wang Temple, Zhu Zhai, and Xiao Zhu Zhai, in front of Liu Hang. We used machine guns to sweep the area, killing many enemy troops. Although the enemy was struck hard, they still tried to push forward stubbornly. Our troops were exceptionally strong, rushing out of the trenches and engaging in hand-to-hand combat for over an hour, eventually breaking through the enemy's line. Our troops then retreated slightly, confronting the enemy on both sides of the Jinjiawan small river. Soon, our fresh troops arrived, charging across the river, engaging in multiple hand-to-hand combats with the enemy, advancing relentlessly, and finally repelling the enemy and restoring the original warning line. In this battle, both sides' elite troops fought bravely in close combat for several hours, resulting in heavy losses on both sides, but we were ultimately able to restore our original position, and fresh troops continued to arrive, immediately issuing an order to counterattack.

After a respite, the enemy forces advanced from the Yong'an Bridge line, crossing the Bao-Liu Highway and attacking our positions near Liu Hang, but were bravely repelled by our forces. The enemy retreated to the east bank of Panjing, and our army is currently in pursuit. Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th report: After a respite, the enemy on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River in Jiangwan, Shanghai, attacked our warning positions but were immediately repelled. The enemy launched two attacks to the east of Liu Hang on the evening of the 19th and one on the 20th, all of which were repelled. Our artillery concentrated its firepower and fiercely shelled the enemy, causing them great losses. The enemy and our forces fought several fierce battles for a small high ground east of Liu He, which is still occupied by our army.

Enemy Retreats to Northeast of Luo Dian Town

The enemy forces launched three attacks on Luo Dian, suffering heavy losses after our brave resistance. Although their troops once again occupied the town, it was nothing but ruins after the enemy's intensive shelling and indiscriminate burning, and threatened by our heavy troops from the Xiaotangzi area, they did not dare to stubbornly defend it. Therefore, they retreated to the northeast of the town to deploy their defenses and await reinforcements. As a result, the front-line battles have been quiet, with occasional artillery shelling of our rear positions, but we have suffered no damage.

Enemy Attempts to Attack Jiangwan Town

The enemy's attempt to break our line from Luo Dian to Dachang has failed. It is reported that the enemy forces are now concentrated in the city center, west of Xiangyin Road, in front of the city stadium, and in the Sanmin Road area. Their outposts, about two companies strong, have reached Fudan University, attempting to attack our Jiangwan Town.

The enemy forces opened fire from newly built artillery positions in the city center yesterday morning, shelling our positions near Jiangwan and Chi Zhi University. At the same time, the Pudong area was also shelled by enemy forces, but our army suffered no losses.

Yesterday, a team of enemy naval marines, together with the enemy from Xiangyin Road, advanced along the Tiyu Hui Road and reached the eastern end of the Shuidian Road, where they were met with a head-on attack by our army and retreated in disarray.

Enemy's Failed Attack on Zhabei

Around 8:00 PM the night before last, the enemy suddenly launched an attack with dense forces on the area near the Eight Character Bridge and the North Railway Station. At the same time, the enemy's artillery also concentrated its fire on the area, indiscriminately shelling it in the hope of suppressing our army's rear, but all were ineffective. Our army, in addition to launching an immediate counterattack, also dispatched artillery support for fierce bombardment. After about an hour of fighting, a fire broke out near the enemy's headquarters in Hongkou Park after being hit by our artillery. At around 7:40 AM yesterday morning, another small unit of enemy forces attacked near the North Railway Station but was swept away by our army with machine guns. The enemy retreated with more than a dozen casualties. Shortly after, they attempted to probe again but were still repelled by our army. Our army still holds its original line.

Yesterday morning, the enemy forces attacked our North Railway Station positions. Our army responded calmly, waiting for the enemy to approach before launching a concentrated machine gun sweep. The enemy forces attacked several times but were unsuccessful. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, enemy naval marines attacked our Tiantong'an area positions again but were also repelled by our army. Our artillery used mortars to shell the enemy's positions in the Hongkou area several times yesterday, causing significant damage to the enemy.

More Enemy Ships Transporting Military Supplies Arrive

Yesterday, two more enemy transport ships arrived in Shanghai. One was named Wuling Maru, docked at the Osaka Wharf, and the other was unnamed, docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, transporting countless enemy military supplies and goods. Among the six enemy transport ships that arrived in Shanghai one after another, the Shanghai Maru and another unnamed transport ship were already fully loaded with enemy corpses and sailed out of the Songkou Port before dawn yesterday to return home. The remaining Ryoyo Maru, Kinugasa Maru, Chida Maru, and the Fifth Unkai Maru are still docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, Osaka Wharf, and Huangpu Wharf, respectively.

### Pudong's Thorough Defense Makes Enemy Landing Attempts Difficult to Achieve

Tidal Surge of the Eighteenth - Guarding Against Enemy Ships Taking Advantage - We Were Prepared Early - Foiling Their Conspiracy

According to a person from Lujiazui in Pudong yesterday, the enemy forces are wary of our forces attacking their ships in the Huangpu River, and have been scouting, but not as much as rumored. On the night of September 18th, when our air force attacked the enemy's base in Yangshupu, the enemy ships fired their anti-aircraft guns wildly, with stray bullets flying everywhere. The enemy's shells also occasionally struck eastward from afar, but since there were no specific targets, the shells all fell in the fields, causing no damage. However, some local residents moved south temporarily to avoid the calamity. Donggou is far from the coast, about two or three miles away. In reality, for the enemy to land there is as difficult as ascending to heaven. As for Yangjing, it is closer to the Huangpu River and therefore more dangerous, and more residents have moved away. There are not many remaining residents along the coast. What is troublesome is that enemy planes are constantly flying around scouting, causing farmers to be wary, because their indiscriminate dropping of bombs and machine gun sweeps are bound to cause unfortunate casualties. Now that the tidal surge on the eighteenth day of the lunar August is approaching, it is hard to say that the enemy will not take advantage of the high tide to launch an attack. However, the ground in Pudong is vast. Apart from the area north of Laiyi Ferry and west of Qingzhai Temple, as well as various factory wharves, Donggou Gaoqiao has only a very small wharf neck, and other beaches are not suitable for their landing. Therefore, we dare to predict that the enemy's Pudong landing conspiracy will be difficult to achieve.

Enemy Deaths Exceed 20,000

The Dagong News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle on August 13th, the total number of enemy deaths has exceeded 20,000. In addition, air force deaths are not included. At the same time, the most severely damaged was the enemy's Kurume Division, which first attacked our Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Shizilin, and Luodian areas, because this batch of enemy troops suffered repeated heavy blows from our army, and hardly any survived. The enemy's Special Naval Landing Force entrenched in the Hongkou District was also almost completely wiped out. Therefore, the enemy's losses in invading Shanghai this time set the highest record in the history of Sino-Japanese wars. According to reports received from relevant parties, the enemy's fifth reinforcement unit, consisting of one division, has now been mobilized from Nagasaki, Kobe, and other places, and is expected to arrive here around tomorrow or the day after.

Enemy Planes Distribute Absurd Leaflets

The Central News Agency reports that at around 10:00 AM yesterday, an enemy plane scattered absurd picture leaflets over southern Shanghai. One large bundle of leaflets did not scatter when dropped and landed on the roof of No. 26 Deyu Lane, Tiantang Street, breaking a hole in it. At around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, enemy planes scattered written leaflets over the Tangqiao area in Pudong, with content that exhausted their usual absurd tactics. The leaflets were co-signed by the "Shanghai Citizens' Liberation Association." This kind of fictitious name, creating something from nothing, is enough to prove their childish ignorance, not worth a knowing smile from intellectuals.

At around 9:00 AM yesterday (the 20th), more than a dozen enemy planes scouted in Pudong, southern Shanghai, and other places, dropping more than a dozen bombs in Zhenru Zhongshan Road and other places in an attempt to disrupt our rear transportation, but our damage was minimal. Subsequently, the seventeen planes gathered and flew to the southeast. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, fifteen enemy planes, formed into five groups, circled over the Qichang Wharf area several times before scattering and flying away. They flew back one after another at 5:15 PM and scattered absurd declarations everywhere, causing great indignation among the residents, who picked them up and threw them into latrines.

Our Air Force Conducted a Night Raid Last Night

A team of our air force flew over Shanghai last night at 11:00 PM, flying along the river to bombard enemy ships and enemy positions. The extent of the enemy's damage has not yet been ascertained.

Western Newspapers Praise Our Air Force's Superb Skills

The Shanghai Times reports that neutral military observers told the Shanghai Times that the Chinese aircraft attack on Shanghai on Saturday night attacked near the Japanese airfield in Yangshupu at 7:45 PM. After that attack, no explosions were heard in the Public Concession. Witnesses claimed that the attack at 11:45 PM involved at least two aircraft advancing along the Huangpu River towards the Huishan District, but only one returned by the original route, while the others took different routes. The aircraft flew very low and could be clearly seen in the moonlight. When passing the former Japanese Club, the anti-aircraft guns on the roof fired heavily, and the aircraft returned fire with machine guns calmly and unhurriedly, flying across the river towards Pudong and then climbing straight into the clouds.

An Enemy Plane Crashes into the Huangpu River

Before dawn the day before yesterday, several enemy planes flew over our positions in the Pudong area to scout. Among them, a seaplane was damaged by our machine guns. In a panic, it tried to escape to Songkou, but unfortunately, when it flew near the Mitsui Wharf, the damaged fuselage suffered severe vibrations, causing it to give way and crash into the river surface near the Mitsui Wharf, sinking immediately.

### United States, British, French, and Italian Notes - Our Side Has Officially Replied

Aircraft Flying Over Concession Endangers Life and Property - Reason Lies in the Japanese Army Using the Concession as a Base for Aggression - To Obtain Protection, Efforts Should Be Made to Eliminate this Root Cause

U.S. Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Yarnell, British Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Little, French Navy Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Le Bigot, Italian Navy Commander-in-Chief Captain Saller, and Dutch Navy Commander-in-Chief Commander Holtzmuller jointly authored letters on the 15th, separately addressed to Mayor Yu and Japanese Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa, requesting that aircraft not fly over the concession and its vicinity, and that attention be paid to the firing of anti-aircraft guns to avoid endangering non-combatant people. Mayor Yu replied with a letter yesterday, which stated: "To the respected Commanders-in-Chief, I have received your joint letter of the 15th of this month, stating that in the past month, residents in the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek and the French Concession have been harmed by anti-aircraft guns from time to time, and requesting that our military authorities take appropriate steps to prevent Chinese aircraft from flying over the concession and its vicinity, and to pay attention to the firing of anti-aircraft guns to avoid endangering non-combatant people. It is also stated that your Commanders-in-Chief have made the same proposal to the Japanese authorities. I hereby acknowledge this. Having investigated, the Japanese army is relying on the concession and the center of the Huangpu River as its military base for aggression. Our air force is fighting for self-defense in our national airspace, which I believe friendly nations deeply sympathize with. Our military authorities deeply regret the dangers that Chinese and foreign people in the concession have encountered in the past. In consideration of the safety of the concession, strict orders have been issued to our air force and other combat units to pay attention at all times and to do everything possible to avoid actions that could endanger non-combatant people in the concession within the scope of possibility. However, the root cause of endangering the lives and property of people in the concession lies in the Japanese army's use of the concession as a military base for aggression against our country. Therefore, this mayor and our military authorities believe that if your Commanders-in-Chief wish to obtain security for Chinese and foreign non-combatant people in the concession, efforts should be made to eliminate this root cause. I hereby reply for your information and consideration."

### Enemy Informs About Outer Bridge - Attitude of Various Countries in Beijing is Cold and Indifferent

All Unwilling to Have Their Nationals Leave - Ambassador Kawagoe Visits Hasegawa Yesterday for Talks

Japanese Navy Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa sent notes to the heads of missions in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 19th, stating that the Japanese naval air force would bomb our capital on the afternoon of the 21st of this month, and requested that the heads of missions immediately notify their nationals in Beijing to evacuate to safe locations before noon on that day to avoid danger. All warships and merchant ships docked there are also requested to sail to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It is reported that the French Consul-General in Shanghai replied to the Japanese side yesterday morning, stating that the French Embassy and Consulate in Nanjing and the warships on the river surface in Xiaguan could not be evacuated, and that attention should be paid to all French interests in the capital of China. Central News Agency reports that Japanese Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa openly stated that Japanese aircraft would go to Nanjing for bombing today (the 21st), causing various speculations among the people in Shanghai. However, according to reliable sources, Japanese aircraft, if given the opportunity, will bomb a certain foreign embassy and some foreign properties.

Ambassador Shigeru Kawagoe, who is hiding in his private residence on Bishun Road, suddenly left his residence at 2:10 PM yesterday, accompanied by Secretary Hoshida and four guards, and went to the naval headquarters office behind the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road via the Baidu Bridge. He met with Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa, Eleventh Squadron Commander Hibino, Army Commander Matsui, and other military leaders in Shanghai, and did not return by the same car until 3:50 PM. According to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Dagong News Agency, the motive for Ambassador Kawagoe's sudden meeting with Hasegawa and others yesterday was to exchange views on how to deal with the overall situation after submitting to the heads of missions a limited deadline of 12:00 noon today (the 21st) for military and civilian officials of each country's embassy in Beijing to evacuate Nanjing to avoid danger. Hasegawa had previously used similar threatening language on the 19th, saying that he would send planes to bomb Nanjing after 12:00 noon today (the 21st), sending notes to the embassies of various countries, requesting that the embassy personnel in Beijing should evacuate to a safe zone by that time. However, the embassy personnel of various countries believe that since China and Japan have neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations, there is no reason for Japanese universities to bomb non-combat zones, so they are unwilling to leave.

### The Enemy Continues to Invade Along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line

Fierce fighting is underway on the Xingji front. The enemy suffered heavy losses west of Machang. There is ongoing warfare southwest of Tianjin. The enemy's flanking strategy has clearly failed.

[Nanjing] According to sources in the transportation sector, the enemy is determined to continue its invasion along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line and is now actively preparing everything. For days, large quantities of supplies, military equipment, etc., have been seized from civilian ships and transported to the front lines. On the morning of the 20th, enemy planes again departed from Tianjin to bomb various locations. (Central News Agency)

[Jinan] Fierce fighting is currently underway on the Xingji front, with no changes in the battle lines. (20th Special Dispatch)

[Jinan] The enemy, who was attempting to advance towards Yao Guantun along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, has already been bravely repelled by our forces. As of the morning of the 19th, there was no more artillery fire at the front. Our main and left-wing positions are now being guarded by newly arrived reinforcements. Four or five li from Yao Guantun station, we are facing the enemy, approximately three or four li away. On the morning of the 19th, two Japanese planes were spotted scouting over Cao County, Yizhou, Jinan, Ningyang, Ziyang, Yutai, and Zou County. Also, two Japanese planes arrived in Cangzhou and circled over the station before flying south to Dezhou and then turning back north. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Jinan] According to a telephone call from Cangzhou at 9:00 PM on the 19th, there were no major changes on the Tianjin-Pukou front. On the left flank, a unit of our reinforcements engaged in fierce combat with the enemy. Under heavy artillery fire, they charged into the enemy's ranks, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties and retreated in panic. We also suffered significant losses. We initially recovered several villages but, due to the lack of defensive fortifications, retreated back to our original positions. However, another unit has advanced to the Niangniang River area, two or three li south of Xingji. The enemy troops have now withdrawn from Xingji Station, only using armored trains to shell us, which we also repelled. It is anticipated that the enemy will attack again on the night of the 19th, and we are preparing for them. The enemy surrounded in Li Lou remains under siege due to the cover provided by civilian houses and the excessive flooding. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Jinan] A certain unit of our reinforcements, having circled around to the rear of the enemy forces on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, launched a fierce counterattack on the enemy's positions at Dongjiazhuang, four or five li west of Machang, on the morning of the 20th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Jinan] There are no changes on the main front today. A certain unit of our reinforcements is engaged in very intense fighting with the enemy on the left flank, killing many in hand-to-hand combat. We managed to recapture several villages, but due to the lack of fortifications, we returned to our original positions. A certain regiment of ours has arrived two or three li south of Xingji Station. The enemy at Xingji Station has retreated, and we are guarding Niangniang Ke south of the station. Road workers at Xingji and Machang have been ordered to prepare to return to their posts. Several enemy planes bombed Cangzhou Station this morning, injuring one person. The telegraph lines were destroyed. One plane scouted this city and Qihe via Sangyuan. At 4:00 PM, twenty-one planes passed over Linyi and Tengxian, scouting Xuzhou, before flying back to Haizhou. Also, three planes strafed south of Xingji. Simultaneously, an enemy armored train arrived at the Xingji area. It seemed to be attempting an attack tonight, but it was repelled by our armored forces. In addition, over eighty of the remaining enemy troops in Li Lou have been surrounded by us. (19th Special Dispatch)

[Beiping] According to a reliable source within the Japanese military headquarters, the Japanese army is continuing its advance south of Beiping. At the same time, it acknowledges that the Chinese army is moving towards the southwest in excellent order. This source points out that the Japanese attempt at encirclement has been confirmed as a failure by the Japanese themselves. In Shanxi province, the Chinese army's positions are extremely solid, and the Japanese army's repeated attacks have been unsuccessful. (20th National Dispatch)

[Tianjin] According to news received here today, the Japanese military's plan to encircle Chinese troops in North China has been proven a failure. 50,000 Chinese troops 50 kilometers south of Beiping have completed their fortifications during heavy rain. The Japanese military used mechanized units for bombing and pursuit, but failed to achieve the desired victory. The Japanese view the Chinese army's change of position as an elusive strategy, causing them considerable doubt. (20th National Dispatch)

[Beiping] According to a reporter from Hai Tong News Agency who personally inspected the Japanese positions in Huaping and along the Ping-Han Railway, the Japanese routes can be traced by shell holes and ruins. The deep trenches dug by the Chinese army to block tanks are visible everywhere. However, the reporter did not see the corpses of soldiers killed in battle because they were buried by both sides. The reporter continued, stating that the failure of the Japanese encirclement attempt can be proven by the small number of prisoners taken when Bazhou fell on Saturday. Twelve hours before the Japanese army entered the city, the Chinese army had completely evacuated in an orderly manner. The Japanese army's offensives elsewhere were met with fierce and strong resistance from the Chinese army. (30th National News Agency)

[Beiping] Heavy trucks transporting wounded and dead Japanese soldiers back to Beiping from the front lines along the Ping-Han Railway have been seen incessantly in recent days. This shows that the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses in its recent attack on the Gu'an and Shuiqing areas. According to a certain foreign reporter who recently returned to Beiping from the front lines, the number of Japanese soldiers killed in the attempt to cross the Shui Ding River and were repelled by the Chinese army is estimated to be over 2,000. (20th Express News Agency Dispatch)

[Beiping] The heroic defense by a Chinese battalion before the fall of Gu'an has now been discovered by a Reuters reporter behind Japanese lines. This Chinese battalion, under extremely intense enemy artillery fire, vowed to stay to the death, until their defensive works were reduced to ashes. The reporter personally visited the site and witnessed the remains of brave Chinese soldiers clinging to a destroyed city tower. Where the shells had struck, the city was a wasteland, and many civilians also died. The remaining 2,000 Chinese soldiers departed safely on the morning of the 19th, two days before Japanese officers claimed to have occupied Gu'an. The Reuters reporter personally witnessed large carts loaded with dead Japanese soldiers being transported north along the road. The number of wounded was even greater, most of them injured by machine-gun fire. Currently, trucks loaded with munitions and military supplies for the front are clogging the roads. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tianjin] Warfare has now broken out southwest of Tianjin. The Japanese Noda unit, supported by aircraft, has launched an offensive against the strong Chinese defensive line west of the canal near the Bo Du River (transliteration), from Fengjiazhuang (transliteration) to Bo Fang (transliteration). It is reported that the Japanese army is now less than 50 kilometers from the Chinese lines. (20th Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch)

### Hasegawa Threatens Foreign Nationals in the Capital to Evacuate

He notified the embassies of various countries in the capital, setting a deadline of this afternoon for complete evacuation. The US embassy personnel actually complied.

[Nanjing] The British and American embassies notified their nationals on the 20th to leave Nanjing, 11 miles from the city, before 11:00 AM on the 21st, but many were unwilling to leave. (20th Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] On the afternoon of the 19th, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai personally handed Mr. Gauss, the US Consul General in Shanghai, a notice from the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet warning officials and citizens of all countries residing in and near Nanjing to evacuate from Nanjing by noon on the 21st. He requested that he forward the notice to the American embassy to inform American nationals in Nanjing and to ask the American ambassador to inform the other foreign embassies and legations in Nanjing to do the same. The full text of the notice from the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet is as follows: "The Japanese naval air force considers Nanjing to be the main base for Chinese military activities. In order to eliminate hostile actions by the Chinese army and to end the current state of hostility as soon as possible, it will, after 12:00 noon on September 21, 1937, take bombing or other means against the Chinese army in and near Nanjing, and all construction works related to the military work and activities of the Chinese army. During these attacks, the safety of the lives of friendly people should be closely watched. However, in order to avoid the unforeseeable dangers of Sino-Japanese hostilities for friendly people, the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet has no choice but to advise officials and nationals of all friendly countries who are now residing in or near Nanjing to take appropriate steps to voluntarily withdraw to a safer area. Foreign warships and other ships in the Yangtze River should also be anchored upstream of Xiaguan to avoid danger." After receiving the notice, the embassies in Beijing held a meeting to discuss it. Personnel from the Soviet and British embassies decided to stay in Beijing, while the German and Italian embassies would not move for the time being, pending instructions from their home countries. However, the United States decided to comply, and on the evening of the 20th, they boarded the American gunboat Luzon and sailed to the Xia San Shan area upstream of the Yangtze River. (Central News Agency)

[Nanjing] After the news came out that the commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet advised officials and civilians of all countries in Beijing to withdraw from Nanjing before the morning of the 21st so that the Japanese army could attack the capital by bombing and other methods, the officials and people in our capital were unusually calm. They believed that after more than a month of fighting in Shanghai, the Japanese army had made no progress, so they changed their strategy and prepared to launch a large-scale attack on the capital with the most brutal tactics. The Japanese may think that this move will threaten the people of the capital and reduce their courage to resist, but it is far from the case that our government and people have the greatest determination to resist for a long time. Even if the capital is unfortunately reduced to ashes, we will never surrender. The barbaric behavior of the Japanese can only enhance the Chinese people's hatred of the enemy. Moreover, since the 15th of last month, enemy planes have repeatedly violated our capital. Especially in recent days, enemy planes have often attacked in dozens, but each time they have been severely attacked by us and failed to bomb us at will, which shows our ability to defend ourselves and makes it difficult for the enemy to succeed. According to international law, Japan has no right to ask foreign diplomats to withdraw from the capital of the country in which they are stationed before the formal war, and foreign consular officials are not obliged to accept this unreasonable request. In fact, since the enemy invaded us, they have never considered the safety of the lives and property of foreign nationals in China, such as the sniper attack on British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the bombing of the American flagship Augusta, and the destruction in Zhabei and other places, which are clear evidence. It is now heard that the embassies of the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, and France attach importance to their diplomatic missions and have decided to reject Japan's unreasonable demands and continue to work in Beijing as usual. People in Beijing are deeply gratified, but it is quite unexpected that the staff of the US embassy accepted Japan's request to withdraw from the Chinese capital where they were ordered to be stationed. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Hasegawa, the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, recently warned the embassies and legations of various countries here, saying that the Japanese air force was preparing to bomb the Chinese capital on a large scale. Therefore, he asked the embassies and expatriates of various countries to completely evacuate before noon on September 21. The German Embassy here believes that the time is too short, but it has tried its best to move the German expatriates who are not limited by their business to a safe area. It is said that there are about 100 German expatriates in Nanjing. It is not yet known what the attitude of the British Embassy is. The American Embassy is preparing to evacuate American expatriates in Nanjing to Wuhu, a port upstream of the Yangtze River. (20th National Hai Tong News Agency Dispatch)

[Washington] Diplomatic observers here said today that the United States may withdraw its embassy staff from Nanjing due to the warning from Japanese Commander Hasegawa. The State Department stated that the Japanese notification has not been received, and Ambassador Johnson to China has not reported to the department. However, Mr. Johnson is fully entitled to implement the plan if he believes it is necessary to withdraw the embassy staff. Observers believe that the US government will demand that Japan be responsible for any loss of American government property. (19th National Dispatch)

### The Capital Was Again Attacked by Air Yesterday

Enemy planes bombed Beijing four times. Our air force fought back in the suburbs, shooting down multiple enemy planes in succession. The cities of Ji, Xu, Cang, and Zheng were also attacked by air. Hundreds of refugees were tragically killed at Suzhou Station.

[Nanjing] Multiple enemy planes attacked in two groups at 10:10 AM this morning. Upon receiving the report, our air force urgently dispatched teams to intercept them, shooting down one enemy plane near Qixia Mountain, two near Zijin Mountain, and one near Jiangyin. Several houses in the Xiangpu Camp and Dengfu Lane of West Street outside Zhonghua Gate were bombed, but the damage was not great. (20th Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Japanese planes came to Beijing again today, disturbing the peace no less than four times, with a total of about 80 planes. The first two waves of attacks each had 12 fighter planes, the third had 25, and the fourth had 31. In the last two waves, each heavy bomber was accompanied by an average of two fighter planes. It is reported that many civilians were killed or injured, and bombs fell almost all over the city, including near the National Government, Central University, Yijiang Gate, Heping Gate, the arsenal, the water plant, and the airfield. A large explosion was also heard near the weather station on top of Zijin Mountain. The roads that were destroyed include Guofu Road near the National Government and the northern section of Zhongshan Road near Gulou. During the first two waves of enemy attacks, the anti-aircraft guns roared continuously for almost two hours. It has now been confirmed that four Japanese planes were shot down this morning, two near Qixia Mountain, one between Zhenjiang and Jiangyin, and one outside Jiangdongmen. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The Air Force Headquarters received a report from the Suzhou local authorities late at night on the 20th, stating that after attacking Beijing at noon on the 20th, the enemy planes all came east in succession. When they passed over Suzhou, citizens witnessed two enemy planes shaking violently from side to side, flying unsteadily. Shortly after, black smoke was seen billowing out, and they suddenly fell downwards. This shows that they had been severely damaged by us and could not hold out. The two planes crashed to the ground in an area about ten miles away from Suzhou. At that time, a huge explosion was heard, far and wide. People have now been sent to search, and they will be transported to Beijing for exhibition as soon as they are found. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Fifty enemy planes launched a large-scale air raid on Beijing at 10:20 AM on the morning of the 2nd. However, the bombs dropped by the enemy planes all landed in the southern part of the city and in the densely populated areas of the city center, wantonly wreaking havoc, resulting in the deaths of 15 civilians and the injury of six others. More than 50 houses were destroyed by the bombing. (Central News Agency)

[Nanjing] The Air Force Headquarters has just received a report from the Danyang County Government stating that at around 11:00 AM on the 20th, when our air force was fighting with enemy planes, a wounded enemy bomber suddenly flew in from a distance, crashing near Danyang Lake. It did not catch fire at the time. The strong men of the area all rushed to search. The entire fuselage was very complete, and the damaged parts were also very minor. The two combatants inside the plane had been shot dead. The county government has now sent people to take custody and will transport it to Beijing for exhibition within a few days. According to reports, our air force has shot down four enemy planes before and after the morning of the 20th, making a total of five planes including this one. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Fifty enemy planes, in two teams, invaded Beijing at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 20th. Upon receiving the report, our army immediately dispatched planes to intercept them. A fierce battle took place in the suburbs of Beijing. Our army fought bravely, shooting down two enemy planes in a row on Zijin Mountain, which caught fire upon landing. Seeing the dangerous situation, the enemy planes, except for three or four that sneaked into Beijing's airspace to wreak havoc, fled in droves. Our army chased them to the sky above Qixia Mountain, where another battle ensued. The enemy bombers were clumsy and difficult to escape, and our agile shooting caused one to be injured on the spot and burned upon landing. Our army took advantage of the victory to press the threat, reaching the Jiangyin area, where the tail of one enemy plane was hit by our fire, and it immediately caught fire and crashed into the river. Our army returned to defense safely. After the investigation, the enemy dropped many bombs in the city this time, but there was no major loss. At 12:40 PM, the alarm was lifted and everything returned to normal. On the 19th, the enemy in Shanghai told foreign reporters that when the enemy planes attacked Beijing on the 19th, they had almost destroyed all our buildings in the capital. Such absurd propaganda is not worth a knowing smile, and the enemy planes attacked again on the morning of the 20th, when four enemy planes were shot down by our brave air force, which further proves that the enemy's propaganda is false and only deceives itself and others. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Britain's Statement on Japan's Blockade of Chinese Coast

Britain Did Not Agree with Japan's Policy; Two Conditions for Inspecting British Ships

[London] The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a declaration last Saturday, stating that the British government had accepted the Japanese navy's inspection of British ships off the Chinese coast. Responsible officials here recently clarified this, stating that in a note to the Japanese government on September 10, the British government stated that the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coast was illegal. However, Britain suggested that if Japan complied with the following two conditions, the British government would not insist on its legal rights. These two conditions are: ① If Japanese warships wish to inspect British ships and there is a British warship nearby, the Japanese warship should first obtain permission from the British warship before boarding for inspection. ② If there are no British warships nearby, the Japanese warship should immediately report to the British authorities after inspecting British ships. As for the policy actually stated in the declaration issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry last Wednesday, it has not been agreed to by Britain before or after. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)

### American Public Opinion

[Washington] According to a survey conducted by the Public Opinion Research Association, 95% of the American people oppose lending money to both China and Japan. The report states that this phenomenon is sufficient to show that the majority of the American people tend towards neutrality and is also sufficient to show the depth of the impact of war issues on the United States. Finally, the report states that at the outbreak of the European War, the U.S. State Department also opposed lending war bonds, but after only one year, the trend changed drastically, leading to the United States being drawn into the vortex. (19th National News)

[Washington] The Washington Post commented on the U.S. neutrality policy today, stating that "It is only natural that the Chinese government is dissatisfied with the arms embargo that is unfavorable to China. President Roosevelt cannot implement the Neutrality Act; judging from the current legal standpoint, there is no war in the Far East. How can the government take the opposite action? If we want to cultivate world peace, we should not treat the nation that resists brutality in the same way as the actions of an aggressor nation." (19th National News)

Current Commentary

### The Application of Geneva Diplomacy

— Auxiliary

After the expansion of the war in North China, the reporter proposed several diplomatic steps that our country could take. One of them was to submit a complaint about the Sino-Japanese incident to the League of Nations. It was explained that "Although Japan has now withdrawn from the League of Nations, according to Article 17 of the Covenant, the provisions of the Covenant can also be applied to disputes or wars between member states and non-member states. However, regarding this point, many people, based on past experience, do not quite agree. But the reason why we advocate submitting this matter to the League of Nations is not to use the power of the League of Nations to stop Japanese imperialism's aggression. Our intention is to use the League of Nations stage as a radio station to announce the aggressor's atrocities. At the same time, although the League of Nations cannot provide us with any assistance in actual action after accepting China's complaint, it can always obtain moral sanctions." (See July 16th Current Commentary) Although this opinion did not attract attention at the time, our government has now taken this step, submitting a complaint to the League of Nations, and the Executive Yuan has resolved to submit this matter to the Sino-Japanese Dispute Advisory Committee for discussion.

Our government formally submitted a complaint to the Council of the League of Nations on the 12th of this month. Before the complaint was submitted, statements were made on the 30th of last month and the 8th of this month, explaining the recent Japanese imperialist aggression against our country and requesting the Council to forward them to the governments of the member states. The articles we cited this time are Articles 10, 11, and 17. Regarding the steps that the League of Nations can take, our representative Gu Weijun proposed three points in his speech at the League of Nations General Assembly on the 15th for the Council to choose from. These three points are for the Council to consider and take action on its own, to submit this issue to the League of Nations General Assembly, or to submit it to the Sino-Japanese Dispute Advisory Committee organized by the League of Nations after the Manchurian Incident. At a closed meeting on the 16th, the Council decided to take the third step and submit our complaint to the Advisory Committee for discussion. Our representative immediately expressed his acceptance, but with a reservation that China still has the right to submit this matter to the Council for consideration and retain various rights under Article 17 of the Covenant. This diplomatic step taken by our representative on the Geneva stage is indeed very appropriate.

However, some people think that this method is too circuitous and cannot achieve rapid results. They believe that according to the articles we cited, the two countries in the Sino-Japanese dispute can be invited to attend the Council of the League of Nations or the General Assembly to discuss ways to prevent the expansion of this matter. If Japan does not comply with the resolution and continues to attack China, the provisions of Article 17 can be applied to impose sanctions on Japan. If this step can be implemented, it would certainly be very straightforward. However, past experience has already told us that the League of Nations is not yet so sound and powerful. At the same time, the United States, which has significant interests in the Far East, has not yet joined the League of Nations. Therefore, without the cooperation of the United States, the League of Nations will not take firm action. Under these complex circumstances, our acceptance of the resolution to submit the Sino-Japanese incident to the Advisory Committee for handling is indeed very appropriate. Moreover, we have attached reservations.

The League of Nations organized the Sino-Japanese Dispute Advisory Committee in 1933, originally wanting countries with interests in the Pacific to participate in the handling of the Sino-Japanese incident. Because at that time, not only was the United States not a member of the League of Nations, but even the Soviet Union had not joined the League of Nations. Later, the reason why the League of Nations was able to pass the resolution not to recognize "Manchukuo" was the result of the efforts of this Advisory Committee. We are now complaining to the League of Nations, hoping that it can take some action against Japanese imperialism's aggression. Naturally, we cannot but make the United States also participate. Moreover, the power of isolationists in the United States still occupies a considerable proportion. In addition to using the medium of the League of Nations mechanism to make the United States participate in sanctioning the aggressor in the Far East, we have not seen a better way to promote American assistance to our war of resistance.

Now the Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet today. Although there may not be any practical action for a while, as long as we firmly resist to the end, international assistance will definitely be on our side.

### Speech by British Foreign Secretary at the League of Nations General Assembly

No Benefit for Either Victor or Vanquished; Britain Willing to Reduce Tariff Barriers

[Geneva] The League of Nations General Assembly held a meeting this morning and continued the general debate. The British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech, stating, "Between countries, there is no conflict that cannot be resolved peacefully. We are prepared to accept any disarmament agreement, but at the same time, we must make all necessary efforts to defend the British Empire and its colonies. The world is now turbulent. Fierce battles are taking place in both the East and the West. This is due to the fact that various countries have not yet recognized the following principle: War is not beneficial to either the victor or the vanquished." Eden then praised the non-intervention policy in the Spanish civil war, saying that this policy was initiated by the French government, and France's desire for peace is well known throughout the world. "Thanks to the non-intervention policy, the Spanish war has been localized. If this policy has to be abandoned, the European situation will inevitably fall into a more dangerous situation. Britain is doing its utmost to maintain peace and promote the implementation of the non-intervention plan. The Mediterranean agreement signed in Nyon recently is one example. However, it is a pity that Italy has not cooperated with this agreement." Referring to the economic situation, he said that the general situation was satisfactory and that it was inappropriate to accuse Britain of adopting protectionist policies. "The first to propose the issue of raw materials to the League of Nations was Britain. The issue of raw materials is not the issue of colonies. The raw materials produced in the colonies account for only 3%. Although the British government is still preparing for its various governments to start negotiations to amend the tariff rates in British colonies, we know that even if the tax rate is revised, the raw material problem cannot be solved, because the difficulty felt by some countries is not the acquisition of raw materials, but the payment for the purchase of raw materials. Now, if we want to solve the payment problem, we must allow free exchange before it is possible, and if we want exchange to be free, we must abolish the system of offsetting accounts, exchange control, and quota import system before it is possible. Therefore, if we want general economic improvement, the various regions that adopt self-sufficiency policies must first change their course before it is effective. Britain is prepared to abolish the exchange control system, because this is the best way to maintain peace." After Eden finished his speech, the Iraqi Foreign Minister took the stage to deliver a speech, expressing his congratulations on the resolution of the dispute between Iraq and Iran and condemning the policy proposed by the British government to divide Palestine. Finally, the General Assembly adjourned until 4 PM. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)

### Politicians from Eight European and American Countries Address the World on Peace

Hull Says Aggression Cannot Lead to Lasting Peace; Eden Says Prepared to Cooperate Economically with the United States

[New York] The National Peace Conference today broadcast the speeches on world peace issues by important politicians from eight countries to 100 million listeners in over 60 countries. U.S. Secretary of State Hull was one of the speakers, stating, "We are determined neither to insert ourselves nor to be drawn into armed conflicts between other countries. But this policy must be supplemented by something. We must make contributions to realize the conditions on which peace can be maintained everywhere. Otherwise, we will eventually have to maintain ourselves in a world trampled by force and war. Complete isolation is impossible in this new world. If regulations and laws no longer exist in the world, the safety of the United States will definitely be greatly affected. Some may think that peace can only be achieved after aggression and conquest, but this is wishful thinking. A country that starts a war, initially thinking that permanent peace lies in the complete defeat of the enemy, will eventually see that the future of the enemy country still exists." Hull also said that any country that does not pay attention to the safety or affairs of its overseas Chinese will soon have its preliminary rights despised. In his view, economic improvement is the best hope for peace, because prosperous people are not easily driven into the spur of fighting, and poor countries, which despise life, are more likely to make desperate bets or resort to force to achieve their goals. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 19th)

[New York] The "Global Peace Conference" held a World Economic Cooperation Propaganda Conference today. U.S. Secretary of State Hull and important European figures, such as British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Prime Minister Chautemps, and Czech Prime Minister Hodža, delivered speeches to the American people, elaborating on the issue of world economic cooperation. Foreign Secretary Eden, speaking from Geneva, stated that the total amount of world trade in 1936 was the highest since 1929. We are therefore optimistic about the prospects of the world economy. He then mentioned the efforts made by the United States and Canada to reduce tariff barriers, saying, "Canada has signed a reciprocal trade agreement with the United States, and I very much hope that Britain can establish a similar agreement with the United States. This kind of agreement is of great benefit to the economic life of the whole world. I remember that a year ago, the United States and Britain signed a currency agreement, which was the first cooperation between the three major countries since the financial panic, a clear proof of promoting world prosperity, because world prosperity is not only a guarantee for people to live and work in peace, but also an element to promote peaceful politics." This speech by Foreign Secretary Eden was very much noticed by people here, because in the words, he expressed that Britain is willing to establish an economic agreement with the United States in a short period. Then, the proposition advocated by U.S. Secretary of State Hull that all countries should formulate commercial contracts based on the principle of reciprocity has won another victory. In addition, Canadian Prime Minister King also issued a broadcast speech from Ottawa, advocating that countries should cooperate economically and compromise politically, and use free discussion to avoid war.

### Election of Council Members of the League of Nations

Turkey and Chile Lose; Iran and Peru Elected

⊙Geneva At the League of Nations General Assembly held this afternoon, Iran and Peru were elected by a majority as non-permanent council members of the League of Nations Council to succeed Turkey and Chile. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)

[Geneva] Regarding the Spanish government's request to be re-elected as a council member of the League of Nations Council, the voting results of the League of Nations General Assembly today failed to pass with a two-thirds majority. As a result, the country lost its eligibility for re-election. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)

[Geneva] When the League of Nations General Assembly met this morning, the representatives of Spain and Turkey requested to be re-elected as council members of the Council, but were both rejected by the General Assembly. According to the law, after the term of office of a council member of the Council expires, if they want to be re-elected as a council member within three years, they must first obtain a two-thirds majority vote from the General Assembly before they can be eligible to be a candidate. The terms of office of Spain and Turkey both expire this year. When the votes were submitted for approval today, there were a total of 47 votes, and 32 votes were required to pass. However, Spain only received 26 votes, and Turkey only received 25 votes, so they were both rejected. It is learned that in this General Assembly, the term of office of Spain as a semi-permanent council member of the Council has expired, and the terms of office of Turkey and Chile as non-permanent council members have expired. There are four countries that have submitted candidacy: Spain, Turkey, Iran, and Peru. Now that the candidacy of Spain and Turkey has been rejected, Iran and Peru will be voted on by the General Assembly this afternoon, and they only need to obtain a majority to be elected. If so, then Iran will replace Turkey, and Peru will replace Chile. What remains is only the seat of the semi-permanent council member held by Spain, and the election will be held after several countries submit their candidacies. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)

### Mediterranean Pact: Britain and France Invite Italy to Join

Representatives of the two countries visit Ciano, requesting clarification of "equal footing."

[London] News today reports that Britain and France are moving towards a compromise that preserves Italy's dignity, aiming to satisfy Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's demands and enable Italy to join the Nyon Agreement. The British and French representatives, respectively, Ingrams and Blondel, have met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, stating that the Nyon Conference representatives are prepared to listen to "practical criticisms." Previously, Britain and France had indicated their unwillingness to compromise further with pro-Franco elements. This new move is quite unexpected. Subsequently, the Italian Foreign Minister issued a statement, reiterating Italy's demand for equality. However, informed observers believe that behind-the-scenes compromise talks are underway, leading to a more moderate tone in the statement. These talks will have no impact on the joint British and French patrol plan in the Mediterranean, scheduled to begin on Monday. (National News Agency dispatch, 20th)

[Rome] Two Italian warships, the submarine "Vascio" and the destroyer "Avier," were completed and launched today at Taranto and Livorno respectively. Local civil and military officials, along with numerous civilians, attended the ceremonies. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 19th)

[Rome] Regarding Italy's participation in the Mediterranean monitoring arrangement, the government issued a statement this afternoon stating that when the British representative Ingrams and the French representative Blondel presented the full text of the Nyon Agreement to Foreign Minister Count Ciano yesterday, they inquired about the interpretation of the Italian government's demand that "Italy should have an equal footing with any other country in any region of the Mediterranean." Foreign Minister Ciano responded orally to the British and French representatives, stating that Italy's demand for equality referred to the Italian fleet having an equal status with the British and French fleets if it participated in the monitoring arrangement. This response represents a specific suggestion. The Italian government has informed the German government of the situation. Italian political figures now claim that the current situation has greatly improved since the Italian government made this response, as Italy's demand is for spiritual equality, not technical equality. This means that the tonnage of the Italian warships assigned to monitoring duties does not need to be equal to that of the British and French warships. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 19th)

### Large-Scale German Naval, Land, and Air Exercises in Northern Germany

Berlin simultaneously conducts air defense drills on an unprecedented scale since the war.

[Berlin] German leader and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Hitler, arrived in Mecklenburg today to review the national military exercises. The exercise area includes most of Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and the Baltic coast. This is Germany's largest exercise since the Great War. Starting tomorrow, the exercise will last for a week. The exercise area (including Berlin), with a population of 4.5 million, must be completely blacked out every night. One of the important subjects in the exercise is the cooperation between the army and the navy. It is expected that the struggle between the "Blue" and "Red" forces, and the naval landing operations, will be spectacular. Foreign military observers attending include British Army General Deverell, Air Marshal Longmore, Italian Army General Badoglio and General Pariani, and Hungarian Defense Minister Röd. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)

[Berlin] Air defense drills began in the city this morning. From 8:30 AM, large formations of aircraft attacked the city. The entire population was alerted and took shelter in underground bunkers. Street traffic immediately stopped, and tram and bus passengers, along with pedestrians on the road, rushed to the nearest shelters. The city's air defense forces rose into the sky to engage the "enemy" aircraft in fierce combat. The alert was lifted after about half an hour. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 20th)

### Our Forces Firmly Defend Luodian and Liuhang Fronts

Intense fighting occurred overnight around Doujia Lane; a large unit of enemy soldiers was annihilated in Sucun. The enemy continues to reinforce, making a final desperate struggle.

The entire front has been relatively quiet for several days. Although there have been continuous small-unit skirmishes, or advances and retreats in certain villages, these have not significantly affected the overall battle situation. After three failed general offensives, the enemy's morale is severely depleted, and their soldiers lack fighting spirit. They seem to be actively reorganizing their remaining forces and waiting for reinforcements to arrive, hoping to make a final attempt. Our army is proceeding cautiously, step by step, and resolutely dealing a head-on blow to the enemy when they attack. This morning, three enemy cruisers and a large number of transport ships gathered outside the mouth of the Song River, bringing an enemy division as reinforcements, waiting to land. As for the Luodian and Liuhang areas, the enemy constantly harasses our positions with small units, but they have been repelled each time. There have been absolutely no changes on our front lines. The enemy's plan to break through the central route and cut off our lines of communication has been completely shattered by our loyal and brave soldiers. In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, the enemy has concentrated their forces in the city center. Since last night and into this morning, they have been extremely busy moving supplies, seemingly planning to aggressively attack our Jiangwan front. They also frequently use small units to launch guerrilla-style raids to probe our army's strengths and weaknesses. We are fully prepared, calm and composed, and have strengthened our defensive works. The enemy will definitely not succeed.

### Fierce Fighting Occurs in Luodian and Sucun

The enemy attacks the line of Sucun and Gushou Village, but they are hit head-on and routed.

There was intense fighting northwest of Luodian last night. Enemy aircraft heavily bombed our army's positions in Yangjia Village and Sucun, about three kilometers north of Chaobumiao, starting in the afternoon. Our army's positions in Gushou Village, north of Sucun, were also the target of concentrated enemy artillery fire. Most of the enemy's artillery positions were located in Shenjia Village, about two kilometers east of Sucun. They fired more than a thousand shells, bombarding until about 11:00 PM. The enemy's infantry then began to move, with a force of more than one battalion attacking our positions in Sucun and Gushou Village. Our army stood firm and did not retreat. To deliver a head-on blow, we also sent a considerable force to jump out of the trenches and meet them in battle, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat more than five times. Under our fierce counterattack, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in disarray. Our lines in Sucun, Gushou Village, Jiangzhai, and Xisongzhai are extremely solid. Yesterday afternoon, enemy artillery bombarded the area again, and our artillery also returned fire. Last night, small groups of enemy troops attempted to raid and harass, but some were routed and the rest were annihilated.

### Stalemate on the Dijing River

(Special Dispatch from this newspaper) Last night, an officer of a certain division came to Shanghai from the Liuhang front. According to him, there has been occasional contact between the enemy and our forces in the Liuhang area in recent days, but these have all been local clashes. The enemy, having suffered heavy losses in repeated fierce battles, dares not take risks lightly. It is expected that they will launch a fourth general offensive after the arrival of the next reinforcements, as Liuhang is the key transportation route between Dachang and Luodian, and the enemy has the ambition to cut off this line. Our army is aware of their plot and has made preparations early, and the air defense units have also been properly equipped. Therefore, no matter how stubborn the enemy's land and air forces are, if they come again, they will not be difficult to destroy in one fell swoop. The officer also stated that as of last night, our army was still holding the west bank of the Dijing River, facing the enemy across the river, forming a confrontational situation. Our country does not want to advance, and the enemy is afraid to cross the river. Their plan for a quick victory has become an illusion. The Dijing River runs south through Dachang and north to Luodian, parallel to the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, and is of great importance to the current battle situation.

### Enemy Attack on Liuhang Repelled Again

The enemy attacks our Baojia Lane position and is pursued and routed at dawn this morning.

The enemy army has repeatedly attacked our Liuhang, attempting to break through our central front line, but has been repelled in recent days. Intense fighting occurred around Doujia Lane the night before last. From morning to night, the enemy concentrated their artillery fire, heavily bombarding our positions near Doujia Lane, Mengwan, and Wangjiufang. They also used multiple aircraft to scout our positions. At night, their infantry attacked under the cover of artillery fire. Our army fought bravely and all night, and finally repelled the enemy. Yesterday morning at dawn, traces of the enemy were found again in the Chenzhai, Wangzhai, and Yangjiufang areas, attacking our positions. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated in disarray by noon. Last night, the enemy added reinforcements, and fierce fighting occurred again overnight in the Doujia Lane area. By dawn this morning, the enemy had been forced to retreat.

### Enemy Attack on Zhabei Fails and Retreats in Disarray

More than half of the enemy's 400 infantry soldiers were killed or wounded; five tanks were damaged by our counterattack.

The enemy, who have been trapped in the line between Zhabei and Jiangwan for a long time, not only have made no progress after 40 days of fierce fighting, but are also showing signs of exhaustion. If the focus of the war had not shifted to the Luodian coastal area, the enemy in that area would have been swept away and annihilated by our army long ago. Although the fighting in that line has continued without stopping in recent days, they have all been vanguard skirmishes and there have been no intense battles. At dawn yesterday, the enemy again used five tanks as a vanguard, covering more than 400 infantry soldiers, and launched a dawn attack on our position near Dijia Bang along the Sports Association Road and Zhoujiazhai. At the same time, the enemy's artillery bombarded fiercely, and they used a small number of troops to disrupt the left and right wings of that section in an attempt to realize their dream of breaking through our army's defense line in that section. After our army bravely fought back, the enemy's five tanks were severely damaged by the concentrated fire of our flat-trajectory guns, small mortars, and machine guns. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy finally could not withstand the attack and retreated in a panic, and more than half of the more than 400 infantry soldiers they were covering were killed or wounded. Last night and this morning, the enemy attacked several times, but achieved nothing.

### Enemy Warships Come and Go Hastily in the Huangpu River

(Central News Agency) Reports that before dawn this morning, three enemy cruisers of more than 10,000 tons arrived at the mouth of the Song River and are now anchored in the waters of Sanxia outside the mouth of the Song River. Their names are Kino, Yrno, and another unnamed ship. The hulls of all three ships are dark gray, and each ship has three funnels, with two white stripes on the funnels. Presumably, they are again carrying enemy reinforcements to Shanghai. In addition, an enemy Red Cross ship also arrived at the same time and is also anchored in the river outside the mouth of the Song River. The ship is named Americon and is presumably preparing to carry wounded enemy soldiers back to their country.

Another report states that, as of noon today (August 21), only the Daitamaru and Ryoyu Maru are still unloading military supplies at the Huangpu Wharf and the North Bund of the China Merchants Bureau. At the same time, dozens of green enemy military vehicles were unloaded at the Huangpu Wharf. The Kinugasa Maru, Daigo Unkai Maru, Boryo Maru, and another unnamed transport ship have all successively sailed out of the mouth of the Song River before dawn today and returned to Japan.

### The Entire Pudong Front Temporarily Becomes Quiet

Our army is on full alert at all ports.

Since the enemy's repeated attempts to land in Pudong failed, rumors had been circulating for the past few days that they would launch a large-scale attack soon to eliminate the threat posed to Japanese warships by our artillery and to obtain large quantities of coal stored in various wharfs along the Pudong coast, and then attempt to advance further. However, our side saw through their plot and calmly deployed strong forces in advance, constructing solid fortifications, which made the enemy's dream of landing turn into a bubble. The enemy also knows that they cannot easily attack our front lines, so the most tense period in the past five days has become quiet, with no fierce actions day or night. Although Japanese aircraft sometimes strafed civilians with machine guns and dropped bombs, and there were intermittent artillery battles between Japanese warships in the Huangpu River and our artillery, these were all irrelevant to the overall situation, and our army did not suffer any damage. Since last night until noon today, our army has been on full alert at all ports along the Pudong coast, so there is absolutely no possibility of conflict occurring. According to general observations, the enemy's plan to attack Pudong has not been abandoned immediately, as they have been busy with preparations in recent days.

### Situation of Enemy Naval Deployment around Shanghai and Songhu

The super-dreadnoughts Mutsu and Nagato have both come to Shanghai; a total of 114 ships from Shanghai and Songhu to Lianyungang.

(Special interview with this newspaper) Today marks the 40th day since the outbreak of the Shanghai war. The enemy has mobilized as many as eight divisions, and even dispatched the Kanazawa 9th Regiment, which they consider invincible, and the Kume 3rd Division, equipped with mechanized units, to Shanghai. Each general offensive has been met with failure, and the Japanese belief that the Shanghai war could be ended quickly and the idea of ​​forcing the Chinese army to retreat have been fundamentally shaken. Our country, with simple infantry, relying entirely on flesh and blood and morale, has resisted the enemy's three-dimensional offensive of land, sea, and air forces, and has been able to hold out for as long as forty days on defenseless positions, preventing the enemy's vehicles from advancing. The enemy then sent the "Nagato," the super-dreadnought battleship they used to "prepare to dominate the Pacific," to Shanghai to help in the battle, but it was still ineffective. Now, they have added the Mutsu, which they consider the most powerful battleship and the first super-dreadnought in the country, to Shanghai to assist in the battle. As for how many other warships are participating in the battle in Shanghai, this is what the general public urgently wants to know. After a detailed investigation, it was found that within the Shanghai-Songhu battle zone, including the blockade zone of the East China Sea ports, and up to Lianyungang in Haizhou, there are as many as 114 large and small warships. Most of them are concentrated outside Wusong, Liuhang Estuary, and the Huangpu River in Shanghai, while the rest are divided among the ports of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, attempting to harass our rear. It is found that the Japanese navy has sent more than 60% of its entire navy to participate in this battle, and almost 80-90% of the warships they consider to be the most powerful and newly built in recent years have been sent to Shanghai. The breakdown is as follows:

The enemy navy's mobilization this time is also considered to be unprecedented in the past 40-50 years since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. In the past month, those who have joined the Shanghai-Songhu battle include: ㊀ two super-dreadnoughts, ㊁ a total of twenty-two cruisers and coastal defense ships, ㊂ nine gunboats, ㊃ a total of fifteen squadrons of destroyers, totaling forty-four ships, ㊃ torpedo squadrons, and the Shimizu Fleet, totaling twenty-nine ships, ㊅ three aircraft carriers, and ㊆ five transport ships. As for ships that are temporarily converted from merchant ships (for transporting troops, food, ordnance, baggage, medical supplies, etc.), there are a total of more than forty ships, coming and going back and forth endlessly. The names of the ships are roughly recorded as follows: (A) Super-dreadnoughts, (1) Mutsu, (2) Nagato, each with a displacement of 33,000 tons, the main guns are 15-inch caliber, now at Wusong and Liuhang Estuary, with multiple squadrons of destroyers and torpedo boats around them for protection, because each ship costs 200 million yuan. (B) Cruisers and coastal defense ships, including: (1) Chōfū, (2) [Unnamed], (3) Kasuga, (4) Natori, (5) Kinu, (6) Yura, (7) Kirishima, (8) Takao, (9) Maya, (10) Nachi, (11) Haguro, (12) Ashigara, (13) Okishima, (14) Kamui, (15) Izumo, (16) Tenryū, (17) Myōkō, (18) Kiso, (19) Abukuma, (20) Kitakami, (21) Oi, (22) Tatsuta. (C) Gunboats, including: (1) Ataka, (2) Uji, (3) Seta, (4) Katata, (5) Hira, (6) Hozugawa, (7) Atami, (8) Futami, (9) Notoro. (D) Destroyers, some of which have two ships in a squadron, and some of which have four ships in a squadron, which are attached to the various battle squadrons and equipped according to the situation. The squadron numbers are not listed, the ship names are Wakatake, Kuretake, Sanae, Asagao, Fuyo, Karukaya, Kikutsuki, Mikazuki, Mochizuki, Yuzuki, Kamikaze, Harukaze, Satsukitsuki, Minazuki, Hazuki, Nagatsuki, Asakaze, Yūkaze, Isonami, Uranami, Shikinami, Ayanami, Amagiri, Asagiri, Yūgiri, Ariake, Yūgure, Shiratsuyu, Shigure, Kiyo, Wakaba, Hatsuharu, Hatsushimo, Uzuki, Kisaragi, Yayoi, Akebono, Oboro, Ushio, Kuri, Ume, Hasu, and Watsutsuki. (E) Torpedo squadrons, the ships are Yubari, Chishima, Manazuru, etc. The names of most of the ships have been erased, making it difficult to know the details. (F) Aircraft carriers, such as the Ryūjō, etc., there are three ships, and it is said that one ship has already left Shanghai for other places. Recently, the country has added another aircraft carrier fleet to the battle.

### Anti-War Sentiment Overflowing in Japan

The people cannot bear the burden of the war; anti-war publications flood the country.

(Special Dispatch from Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo) Since the Japanese warlords launched wars in North China and Shanghai, the Japanese Diet has repeatedly increased the budget, and the Japanese people have felt the suffering of being unable to bear the burden. In addition, thousands of conscripts are carried out of Tokyo Station every day, and the old fathers and beloved wives are covered in tears of sorrow, resulting in the long-accumulated anti-war sentiment finally exploding. First, Sei Morihiro, a well-known Japanese lawyer and former lecturer at Meiji University, wrote an article last month entitled "Warning to Militarists," which exposed the ambition of the Japanese warlords and pointed out the reasons why Japan cannot fight in China. He said that if Japan wants to fight, wartime finance would be difficult, and if taxes are increased again, the people will not be able to bear the burden and will cause a revolution. The full text is full of anti-war sentiment. The article was published in the Hawaii Business Report on August 12. After the article was published, the Japanese warlords were very dissatisfied. A few days ago, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police immediately arrested Mr. Sei on suspicion of violating Article 99 of the Military Criminal Law and prosecuted him. In addition, both the left and right wings in Japan oppose Japan's launching of a war against China. Therefore, anti-war publications have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In recent days, anti-Tokyo publications have been published in the Japanese mainland. The police agencies in various places are paying close attention to them. Recently, a large number of anti-war publications have been seized, such as pamphlets such as "People's Friend" and "Peaceful Warrior," and extremely large numbers of leaflets. The Japanese authorities attach great importance to them. The Japanese government, seeing that the people are full of anti-war sentiment and the unstable atmosphere is spreading throughout the country, is deeply afraid of causing an incident. Therefore, Japanese politicians have been taking to the streets for days to make purchases, hoping to make the people sympathize with the government's claims. Fumimaro Konoe, in his capacity as Prime Minister, also condescended to speak to the people at Hibiya Park. This shows one aspect of the anti-war sentiment in Japan.

### Japan's Unreasonable Demands Resolutely Rejected by Britain

US Embassy staff continues to work in Beijing, and states that Japan is responsible for any losses.

[London] Japan's demand that British officials, civilians, and warships leave Nanjing has caused great concern in Britain. The British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Archibald Clark Kerr, and the Commander of the Far East Fleet, Vice-Admiral Charles Little, have already rejected this demand. British politicians expressed great approval upon hearing the news, and said that Japan's demand was unreasonable, and the British side resolutely does not recognize that country's right to issue orders or make recommendations to the British authorities within the territory of a third country. Therefore, although Kerr and Little did not seek instructions from London in advance for the decision they adopted, the government will definitely approve it. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 20th)

[Washington] After the Japanese naval authorities demanded that diplomats and overseas Chinese of various countries leave Nanjing before the afternoon of the 21st of this month, the US ambassador to China, Johnson, has moved to a gunboat to work. Acting Undersecretary of State Moore recently issued a statement on this matter, stating that the government has instructed the ambassador to act at the opportune moment when the situation is dangerous, and the decision to leave Nanjing this time is in compliance with the order. As for the compensation for the damage suffered by the US overseas Chinese, the government has previously negotiated with that country, and it does not intend to submit further negotiations at this time. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 20th)

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Hasegawa, the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, threatened to bomb our capital and illegally sent notes to various countries, requesting that the embassies and overseas Chinese in Beijing evacuate. Envoys from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union decided to continue working in Beijing as usual and did not heed the request. However, the actions of the United States, such as the US Ambassador Johnson and the embassy staff moving to the US gunboat to work, have aroused dissatisfaction among people from various countries. According to reliable information obtained in this port, the temporary move of the US ambassador to the gunboat is actually a temporary expedient measure and not a complete departure of the embassy from Nanjing. The US Embassy still has a second secretary in the embassy working as usual. It has been stated that if the embassy suffers losses from Japanese aircraft bombing, the Japanese side will be held fully responsible for compensation. As for the two US warships, the Luzon and the Guimaras, both are moored at the Jardine Matheson Wharf in Shanghai and will not sail elsewhere in the short term. As for the British side, it has expressed a more resolute expression and may lodge a protest with Japan.

### Our Right Wing Makes Progress on the Jinpu Line

We recaptured Yao Guanzhuang and several villages west of Xihua; the enemy's attempt to land outside Lianyungang failed.

[Jinan] There was fierce fighting north of Yao Guanzhuang today, and the sound of artillery was especially loud. It is reported that we recaptured Li Xinzhuang and Liujia Yard northwest of the station, six li away from the station. We recaptured Chenjia Yard and two other villages at 6 PM, killing many enemies. Those villages have been set on fire. Our right wing has made great progress. The enemy's fire headquarters is in Gao Guanzhuang, northwest of the station, and our army is attacking it. (Special telegram, 20th)

[Jinan] Three or two enemy planes arrived in Chenzhou from time to time to bomb and shoot, but the bombs fell into the mud and did not explode. At 2 PM, five enemy planes passed through Taierzhuang and flew to Xuzhou, and then returned to Lianyungang via a neighboring city. At 3 PM, 60-70 enemy planes covered the landing attempt of the Marine Corps at the port. Our garrison returned fire with artillery. After two hours of battle, the enemy ships were defeated and retreated outside the port without being able to land. (Special telegram, 20th)

### Enemy Planes Bomb Guangzhou

Three enemy planes were shot down; many bombs were dropped, but no damage was done.

[Guangzhou] At 6:20 this morning, more than 20 enemy planes appeared in the sky over Guangzhou. Our planes immediately took off to fight the enemy. For a time, the sound of machine guns shook the entire city. After 8:10, the enemy planes fled in confusion, and a total of three were shot down by our planes. Although the enemy dropped many bombs, the damage was minimal.

### The League of Nations Advisory Committee to Meet Today

The U.S. to Send an Observer

[Geneva] The League of Nations Assembly's Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue is scheduled to meet this afternoon to discuss the complaint submitted by the Chinese government. The U.S. government has dispatched its Minister to Switzerland, Harrison, as an observer, ready to attend the meeting. As for the Japanese observer, it is said that they will be watching the meeting informally. According to sources, although Japan has withdrawn from the League, it still participates in the work of various League bodies as usual. If the League takes measures unfavorable to Japan, Japan will inevitably stop participating altogether (Central News Agency, 21st, Havas dispatch).

[Washington] The U.S. government has dispatched a representative to Italy to participate in the League of Nations Advisory Committee which is starting discussions today about China's complaint. The representative is the current Minister to Switzerland, Harrison. However, the U.S. has verbally notified the League that the U.S. cannot say to what extent it can cooperate with the Advisory Committee until it receives notification specifying the duties it should fulfill. Furthermore, Harrison's participation in the meeting, his position and intention, should be the same as that of Wilson when he participated in the Manchurian Question Committee in 1933. The State Department, in order to avoid misunderstandings, specifically stated that "The U.S. government must state that the U.S. cannot bear the obligations that League of Nations members occasionally incur because of their membership. The U.S. government deeply believes in the principle of cooperation among all countries in the world and is willing to seek peaceful solutions to international conflicts. The U.S. government will carefully consider specific suggestions made by the League to the U.S., but it is not prepared to engage in ideal consultations on policies or plans, etc." (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters dispatch).

[Geneva] British Foreign Secretary Eden will return home tonight to attend the cabinet's weekly meeting (Washington dispatch, 22nd of this month). Before departing, he had lengthy talks with French Foreign Minister Delbos, and it was agreed that they would adopt a consistent attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute and the League of Nations Administrative Council's semi-permanent directorate elections (Spain is no longer eligible for re-election). (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas dispatch).

### Random Comments

— Xiang

Kidnappers kidnap valuables, bandits rob. This works on wealthy and influential millionaires, but if they encounter a penniless pauper with "only one pair of pants and a rope," they cannot apply their skills. The Japanese notified the diplomatic missions of various countries the night before last that Japanese aircraft planned to attack the capital again, demanding that all foreign diplomats and expatriates residing in Nanjing evacuate the capital before noon on Monday. This kind of behavior is clearly a scare tactic. However, our country has long been prepared to sacrifice and endure scorched earth in this war of resistance. No threats or coercion can shake our resolve. Furthermore, since China and Japan have not formally declared war, the Japanese side is actually using the status of the Third Fleet Commander to arbitrarily direct the representatives of third-party nations, the foreign diplomats, to evacuate the capital. This attitude not only disregards the existence of international law, but also disrespects the dignity of various governments to such an extent. This kind of base and ridiculous behavior is enough to show the impoverishment and despair of the nation. I implore those in the Japanese camp to stop and let others laugh at your incompetence.

### A Special Account of the Fierce Battle at Xishengtang

— Ping

The fall of Baoshan, with the entire battalion of our Yao Zixiang martyred in the city, this tragic spirit of sacrifice shocked and admired people all over the world. The hundreds of densely packed cannons on the enemy's warships, while destroying the lives and property of countless civilians along the coast, could not shake the resolve of our front-line soldiers to resist the enemy in the slightest. Without hesitation, they have already given the war-mongering country a severe lesson.

Yesterday, at the Eighth Military Hospital on ×× Road, I met several brothers from our □□ Division who were stationed at Xishengtang in Baoshan. A certain Tang Yushan, a deputy company commander, told the reporter about their loyal and courageous battle on the 16th—that day, at five o'clock in the morning, the hundreds of cannons on the enemy's warships once again densely bombarded our positions. But thanks to our "of the same culture and race" gunners, the shells flew over the heads of our brothers, turning the ponds upside down and digging many huge holes in the earth. After receiving this grand gift, our brothers jumped into the holes to build fortifications.

After the work of the "salute cannons" was completed, the second lesson was three aircraft coming to our positions to bomb aimlessly. But unfortunately, one bomber had just circled around for reconnaissance when it was shot down by our anti-aircraft guns, falling from the sky like a dragonfly skimming the water. It is said that the Kisarazu Air Group had a grand "farewell ceremony" when it departed, and the pilots secretly carried "thousand-stitch belts" and other amulets. However, the Bodhisattva was not effective, so the widow, Mrs. Minzi, wrote in a letter to her father-in-law, Uzhuta Unosuke, "I hope you have the spirit of Sergeant Kurosaki who avoided death in battle." The soldiers have no fighting spirit, and the power of airplanes and cannons can only be applied to our non-combatant refugees.

After this plane was shot down, the remaining two also flew towards the outer Wusong port. Based on our brothers' experience, the charge will naturally follow. Sure enough, starting at eight o'clock, the enemy advanced with machine guns, attacking us. Perhaps the reader has not seen the words published by an enemy army officer in a certain newspaper, who said, "Modern warfare is scientific warfare. Melee combat and broadswords are no longer applicable." The first two sentences are indeed facts, and the unspoken meaning of the latter two sentences is that they have been subdued by our brothers' brave melee combat and broadswords. That day, there were as many as seven or eight melee combats at Xishengtang. This does not mean that the enemy also adopted this "unscientific" combat method; it means that their charge retreated when they encountered our brothers fixing bayonets and fighting them desperately, waiting for another opportunity to come again. This happened again and again until four o'clock in the afternoon, when they knew it was difficult and retreated. That deputy company commander and several brothers only suffered minor injuries, which shows the result of this battle.

One thing that is worthy of our grief is that the enemy used Northeastern compatriots as vanguard during their charges. When our army approached, they shouted that we are 400 million compatriots, Chinese should not fight Chinese, and the front-line brothers were forced to stop fighting and invite them to our positions. And the painful thing happened here. When our brothers fought the enemy for the second time, they disrupted our rear, so we had to painfully resolve them.

Haven't the Northeastern compatriots suffered enough oppression from the invading country? Absolutely not! But they already know that "Chinese should not fight Chinese," so why did they turn against us in our rear positions? This situation is very obvious. Under Japanese oppression, they have been completely enslaved. The deeper the poison they receive, the more they forget that they are still real Chinese. Their insane actions are indeed hateful, but their situation is pathetic.

Therefore, recovering the Northeast is not just a slogan. We must do it practically. There are so many pitiful compatriots there who are eagerly awaiting our rescue.

### Epidemic Kills People

Court Reports 277 Deaths in 19 Days Based on Hospital Reports

Since the beginning of autumn, a severe epidemic has been rampant, with hundreds of people dying from cholera and dysentery. According to the death toll reported by the isolation hospital of the Public Works Bureau to the procuratorate of the First Special District Court alone, there were 22 deaths on the 10th, 14 on the 11th, 15 on the 12th, 29 on the 13th, 30 on the 14th, 23 on the 15th, 16 on the 16th, 51 on the 17th, 40 on the 18th, and 37 on the 19th, totaling 277 people. Since the causes of death were all severe cholera and dysentery, it is hoped that citizens will pay special attention to their diet and keeping warm to avoid contracting these diseases.

### Bumper Cotton Harvest

Totaling Over 19 Million Dan, War Affects Purchasing Power

Since various cotton-producing provinces in our country have been engaged in the promotion and improvement of cotton planting, cotton production in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan and other twelve provinces has greatly increased, especially in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces, which have the largest output. The total cotton field area in the above provinces is 62,423,934 mu, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year. This year, new cotton from various provinces has begun to be marketed. Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and other provinces have reported bumper harvests due to favorable rainfall. According to the estimate of the Central Cotton Improvement Institute of the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Ministry of Industry, the output of lint cotton is 19,661,755 dan, an increase of more than 16% compared to last year, which is the highest number ever. However, due to the outbreak of war, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces have become war zones. At the same time, various Chinese and foreign yarn factories in Shanghai have been forced to stop work, and all industries have been affected by the war, so although cotton has been harvested in various provinces, cotton merchants are unable to purchase it, especially cotton in the war zone. Various banks are carefully considering investing in cotton purchases. The China Cotton Industry Company, which has strong capital, has also greatly reduced the amount of cotton purchased this year compared to previous years. The provincial governments of various cotton-producing provinces have been trying their best to encourage purchases to avoid affecting the livelihoods of farmers.

### Stagnation in Shanghai's Chinese Yarn Trade

Factories Transport Yarn to Other Ports for Sale

There are a total of 31 Chinese yarn factories in Shanghai, with 1,208,076 spindles. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, various factories have been forced to stop work. Although factories in western Shanghai, such as Shenxin, Yongan, Xinyu, Tongyi, and Hongzhang, have managed to resume work, the yarn sales are stagnating due to transportation issues and the cessation of purchases by merchants from various regions stationed in Shanghai. Therefore, various factories in Shanghai are transporting their yarn to other ports for sale. The market price in other ports is about 270 yuan per package for standard Chinese yarn, which is more than ten yuan higher than before, but the transaction volume has decreased slightly compared to before. As for the yarn factories in Jiangsu, Hubei, Henan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other places, they are all operating as usual.

### Shanghai Local Court Tightens Budget

Only Four Bailiffs Remain, Deputy Police Chief Dismissed

The Shanghai Local Court, due to financial difficulties caused by the war, has been ordered to tighten its budget. On the bailiff side, it has been disbanded, leaving only four people. Its procuratorate continues to work as usual due to its duties. However, all judicial police officers remain completely unchanged and report to the court every day for duty and are not allowed to leave without permission to strictly guard against breaches. Anyone found to be derelict in their duties will be dismissed. The recent resignation of Deputy Police Chief Chen Xihui has been approved. It will be replaced by a court police officer. It is learned that the court police organization of the local court has two chief and deputy police chiefs and two police sergeants. However, the deputy police chief's duties are handled by the chief police chief, who carries out orders from above, and the police sergeants handle official duties under the police chief, so the deputy police chief is no longer needed. It is reported that it has been ordered to be dismissed.

### Red Swastika Society Continues to Rescue Wounded Soldiers

Various Branches Work Hard to Help

It is reported that the Red Swastika Society rescue team continued to depart the night before last to rescue five wounded soldiers in the ×× area and send them to the ×× Hospital outside the concession for treatment. However, the hospital is already overcrowded, and the Red Swastika has no way to set up a hospital outside the concession due to various factors such as manpower, financial resources, and location.

### Two People Killed by Stray Bullets

On the evening of September 18, when our air force soldiers bravely attacked enemy warships and enemy army positions in the skies over the Huangpu River and Hongkou area, the enemy panicked and fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns indiscriminately to resist. That night, an enemy stray bullet flew into the third-floor pavilion room at No. 12, Jin Shenfu Road, in the French Concession. At that time, Wang Shaohua, a 40-year-old maid from Nanjing who lived in the room, was sleeping when a bullet shot in from behind her left shoulder and turned into her abdomen. She woke up in a dream, bleeding profusely, shouted "Ah!" and then died. Gao Wanshi, who was sleeping in the same room, felt that she could not be saved and immediately reported to the landlord to report to the French police. The body was sent to the coroner's office. Yesterday, a report was filed with the Second Special Court, and the county Wang, the prosecutor, and the forensic doctor came to examine the body. The bullet could not be taken out. It was confirmed that he died from a stray bullet. Because the body belonged to someone from the countryside, the official instructed the body to be handed over to Ge's association for storage in the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for his family to claim. Also, Xu Linfu, a seven-year-old boy living at No. 87, Lanwei Ai Road, was playing idly on the drying platform behind the house at eight o'clock that night when he was hit by a stray bullet in his back and left waist. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at ten o'clock yesterday morning. The mountain hospital notified the French police to send the body to the coroner's office, waiting for the court to examine it today.

### Fufeng Flour Factory Warehouse Catches Fire Yesterday Afternoon

The intensity of the fire was unstoppable. The Public Concession Fire Brigade received the news and rushed various vehicles to put out the fire. However, due to the excessive intensity of the fire, it was difficult to see immediate results. It was not until about 1:30 p.m. that the fire was gradually extinguished. As a result, several warehouses and a huge amount of socks stored there were completely burned. The cause of the fire is being investigated in detail.
