Original Text of He Yingqin's Opening Address

[Chongqing] The original text of Minister He's opening address at the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee meeting at 11:00 AM on the 6th is as follows: Comrades, today is the inauguration of the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee. Military reorganization is the responsibility of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Therefore, upon receiving orders from the National Government and Chairman Chiang, I, despite being very busy, came to Chongqing with Director Gu to participate. Director Liu, although newly recovered from a long illness, also came with the committee members as scheduled. Therefore, we have the opportunity to meet and discuss the methods and steps for implementing military reorganization in Sichuan and Kang, striving to fully implement the established plan. I feel very pleased about this and should first express my gratitude to Director Liu and all comrades. Speaking of military reorganization, this is an important task after the completion of national unification. It can also be said that only by thoroughly completing military reorganization can true national unification be achieved. Let's take a look at the major continental military powers in the world. For example, the Soviet Union has only about 690,000 regular and militia backbone troops, organized into 35 regular infantry divisions and 15 cavalry divisions. France has 455,000 troops, organized into 25 infantry divisions, 5 cavalry divisions, and 2 brigades. Germany has 450,000 troops, organized into 36 divisions. Italy has about 300,000 troops, organized into 31 infantry divisions, 2 light divisions, and 3 Alpine brigades. Japan has about 250,000 troops, organized into 17 divisions (totaling 70 infantry regiments). The standing army of each country is at most only several hundred thousand. Once there is a foreign war, these several hundred thousand troops serve as the backbone, and reservists and veterans are called up to form the necessary force. Their combat effectiveness can be maintained for several years to fight the enemy to the final victory. This is why each country implements a conscription system, with reservists and veterans who can be called up for replenishment. Unlike our country, which maintains a standing army of more than two million troops in peacetime, but due to loose organization and lack of unified command, once the country faces foreign aggression, these two million troops may not be fully utilized at the front. Even if two-thirds can be used, once there are casualties, illnesses, and attrition, there are no reserves to replenish them. At the same time, because of the large quantity but poor quality, the strength of our one division is not as strong as that of one brigade from the major powers. For example, in the Battle of Shanghai and the Great Wall Campaign, the enemy's strength was almost equal to ours, but we still could not win. This is entirely due to the large quantity but poor quality. The country spends a lot of military expenses to support these two million troops in peacetime, but they cannot fully fulfill the responsibility of protecting the country and its people. This is a very dangerous thing and a great shame for our military. In order to complete the necessary military preparations for national defense and ensure that the fighting force can be replenished continuously, we must implement a conscription system. To enhance the combat effectiveness of our army, we must first reorganize the military, so that the organization, personnel, management, education, training, and command system of the army are completely unified under the central government. Moreover, our military budget amounts to tens of millions of yuan each year, but this amount is only enough to maintain the basic living of officers and soldiers, and there is no mention of enriching weapons and equipment, let alone supplementing new weapons and equipment. We must make the national army uniform and modernized, capable of undertaking the task of national defense and responding to modern warfare. In particular, we must reorganize the military, save unnecessary expenses, and use the savings to enrich new weapons and increase special forces. Therefore, since 1936, the Ministry of Military Affairs has been following the military reorganization principles approved by Chairman Chiang and has begun to carry out the work of military reorganization, starting with the centrally controlled troops. In a year and a half, dozens of divisions have been reorganized, and it is planned to gradually nationalize and modernize all national troops. The reorganized troops will be listed as the backbone of the national defense forces and bear the important responsibility of national defense. Since the implementation, everything has been very smooth and effective. In mid-February of this year, the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee was held, and a report on the national military reorganization principles approved by Chairman Chiang was submitted. These principles include five points: First, unify the organization. There are currently six types of organizations. Considering the needs of modern warfare, the possibilities of equipment, and the ease of adjustment and implementation, unify them into two types: A and B. (Omitted) Second, reduce large units and enrich small units. (Omitted) Third, increase the combat effectiveness of the troops. (Omitted) Fourth, do not increase recurring expenses. Within the existing budget of each division, reorganize and appropriately reduce the organization, reorganize and improve the treatment of officers and soldiers, and issue national disaster allowances to ensure that the organization and expenses are suitable, without increasing additional expenses, and achieve the purpose of reorganization. Fifth, personnel and management are handled entirely in accordance with laws and regulations. For example, the appointment, tenure, transfer, punishment, and retirement of officers in each unit must be in accordance with the provisions of personnel laws and regulations. In particular, the appointment, removal, and transfer of officers must be submitted to the central government for approval and must not be appointed independently or reported after the fact. In addition, those who have appointed managers in each division must gradually change to actual expense management, implement roll call issuance of salaries, implement annual and temporary accounting inspections, compile budgets, and eliminate the past malpractices of contracting and embezzlement. These principles have been approved by the central government, and the reorganization of the national army will be carried out in accordance with these principles. Sichuan and Kang are the base for national defense, and the resources of the people of Sichuan and Kang are excellent and rich in national and ethnic concepts. In recent years, the military personnel of Sichuan and Kang have made many contributions and great efforts to the work of the National Revolution. However, due to historical reasons, many units have expanded their large units day by day, increasing a large number of unarmed soldiers, and have not been able to enrich their weapons and equipment. It can be said that many of them are not used by the major powers before the war. In terms of the number of troops in Sichuan and Kang, the number reported to the central government is eight armies, 26 divisions, and nine independent brigades, totaling 171 infantry regiments. Comparing based on regiments, it is more than two and a half times the number of troops in the entire Japanese army. It is no wonder that it is difficult to enrich the quality with Sichuan Province supporting such a large army. Therefore, the military of Sichuan and Kang must be reorganized, which is a unanimous request of the generals of Sichuan and Kang. Its motivation began around March 20 of this year, when Chairman Liu sent Secretary-General Deng and Director Lu to Beijing on behalf of him. At that time, Acting Director He of the General Headquarters was also in Nanjing. After everyone met, they talked about the issue of national unification, the issue of enriching national defense forces, and the issue of nationalizing the local troops throughout the country. Therefore, they felt that the military of Sichuan and Kang urgently needed to be reorganized in advance. At that time, I had already drafted a few opinions and asked Secretary-General Deng to convey them to Chairman Liu for reference. The most important point in these opinions was that Sichuan is the only base for national defense, and it is hoped that the central government and local areas will unite sincerely to build the foundation for national restoration and ethnicity. It is best to achieve the nationalization of the military in Sichuan and Kang. Chairman Liu adopted the opinions I contributed very humbly, and then repeatedly discussed them based on these opinions and submitted them to Chairman Chiang for approval. Finally, the formal decision on the Sichuan-Kang military reorganization plan was made. This plan was telegraphed to Chairman Liu by the Ministry of Military Affairs on June 22, and then telegraphed to the army commanders. Chairman Liu replied to the Chairman on June 25, expressing his respectful acceptance, and the army commanders also replied one after another, expressing their support. The spirit of Chairman Liu and the army commanders of serving the country impartially is deeply admired. Everyone has seen the original text of the plan, so there is no need to repeat it now. The mission of this meeting is to study the implementation methods based on this plan. At the opening of the meeting, I would like to state two points that I hope for from this meeting: First, the main purpose of this meeting is to thoroughly implement military reorganization in Sichuan and Kang. In other words, it is to nationalize the military in Sichuan and Kang. I hope that everyone will not be polite and will fully explain the current situation of the army and personal opinions orally or in writing for reference in the discussion, so as to determine an implementation step and method that is as perfect as possible. Second, the duration of this meeting is very short, and the duration of the military reorganization is also clearly stipulated in the plan. The standards for all opinions and requests should be based on the principles of the plan and within the limits of what is permitted by the facts and financial resources, and should be proposed with discretion. In general, it is expected that it can be put into practice immediately after the decision. This meeting focuses on researching implementation methods, not on empty talk about theories or making requests and opinions that are too far from reality. I hope everyone will use this short amount of time to express insightful and unique opinions. In short, all the troops in Sichuan and Kang must be thoroughly reorganized to become a modern national army, and all must be commanded and dispatched by the central government to meet the needs of national defense. Only then can we achieve the true purpose of our military reorganization. Finally, I have a few more points to report incidentally: First, our military reorganization is aimed at enriching national defense forces, and the universally implemented military reorganization is to nationalize all local troops with different historical organizations and inconsistent pay scales, rather than reducing or disbanding troops as speculated by the general public, and the central government will not send additional personnel to join the various units. Therefore, the result of the military reorganization is that not only will the strength of the various units not be reduced, but the overall strength will be increased and enriched. Second, recurring expenses will still be organized within the original budget scope, and unnecessary expenses must be effectively saved to improve the treatment of officers and soldiers and supplement weapons, clothing, and agricultural tools. Third, if there are officers and soldiers who are dismissed from the various units, in addition to the old, weak, and disabled, the central government will definitely find ways to settle them, either by sending them to schools for training or by having them settle in the border areas. They will definitely not be left without a livelihood and suffer the pain of being displaced. Fourth, the central government's military reorganization is entirely from the perspective of the country, relieving local difficulties and sharing the responsibility of the generals. Everything is handled with a fair and peaceful attitude, without any prejudice. However, whenever something is handled, there will inevitably be a very small number of people who are used by villains, who, without clarifying the facts, will use all kinds of methods to provoke and alienate, and their intention is nothing more than to hinder the success of the matter and make the country never progress and never unite. I hope that all comrades will pay close attention to prevention, and on the one hand, uphold our spirit of mutual trust, calm down, and discuss a feasible and well-managed step and method openly and honestly. Never listen to the instigation of these people, so that everyone's loyalty, dedication to the country and the people, and painstaking efforts will be in vain, and the great cause of national rejuvenation cannot be completed quickly. This is my sincere hope, and I hope everyone will pay attention to each other and encourage each other, and when you return to your units after the meeting, you must also explain this meaning in detail to the officers and soldiers, so that everyone can deeply understand the significance of the central government's military reorganization and move forward together on the bright road.

Vice Chairman Liu Xiang's Speech

[Chongqing] Liu Xiang's speech at the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee on the morning of the 6th is as follows: Minister He, Director Gu, army commanders, division commanders, officers, today is the first day of the Sichuan-Kang military reorganization meeting. Minister He has clearly stated all the issues and methods related to military reorganization. I originally had nothing more to say, but because the Sichuan-Kang military reorganization is very important, I would like to report a few simple reasons to everyone at today's meeting: First, the principles of Sichuan-Kang military reorganization have long been stipulated by the central government, and the generals at all levels in Sichuan and Kang have unanimously telegraphed their respectful acceptance. Although I have just recovered from illness and fear the fatigue of traveling, I must personally come to Chongqing to participate in the important military reorganization meeting, so that I can be of some help to the smooth progress of military reorganization. I feel that this Sichuan-Kang military reorganization is a necessary requirement of the country. At the same time, from the perspective of our country, I feel that the country's various forces cannot be improved, and we soldiers have a great responsibility. This time, I and the generals telegraphed to the central government to accept the principles of military reorganization, entirely for the benefit of the country and the sincerity of supporting the leader. But with this expression of sincerity, there must be a method of implementation. If there is no appropriate and practical method, it cannot be implemented or cannot be achieved as expected, then the meaning of this meeting will be lost and we will fail to live up to the leader's expectations of us. Therefore, I am attending the meeting despite my illness, hoping that the things discussed at the meeting can proceed smoothly. Second, the significance of military reorganization lies in our ability to implement the expected implementation thoroughly. From the perspective of military reorganization methods, the most important thing is the aftermath of military reorganization. There must be officers and soldiers who are dismissed from the various armies in accordance with the new organization. We have already accepted the principles of military reorganization, but we must have good methods. Therefore, what must be studied at the military reorganization meeting is the issue of the placement of the dismissed officers and soldiers in the future. This is the second significance I want to say today. The above two points of significance are my hopes after accepting the principles of military reorganization. If there is a suitable method for the second point of significance, we believe that military reorganization will be easy and will definitely proceed smoothly and be realized on schedule. This time, Minister He came to Chongqing to preside over this meeting, and we can refer to the local situation at any time in accordance with Minister He's intentions and discuss it together. I will not only contribute opinions, but also the army and division commanders and committee members who participate must also contribute opinions as much as possible. When I arrived in Chongqing yesterday, regarding everything,

[Chongqing] Liu Xiang issued a written statement to visiting reporters today as follows: This time, I was ordered to reorganize the troops in Sichuan and Kang. The significance is extremely important. Reorganizing the organization, enriching the content, and striving to increase the strength of the troops in Sichuan and Kang to be loyal to the Party and the country is an urgent task. Therefore, upon receiving the Chairman's telegram on military reorganization, I sincerely supported the military reorganization methods. Now, the central government has specially sent Minister He and Director Gu to Sichuan to preside over the affairs of the Military Reorganization Committee and appointed me to assist in the management. In order to promote the smooth implementation of military reorganization methods, I am attending the meeting in Chongqing despite my long-term illness. At this meeting, I do not have any special proposals, but in view of the responsibilities of my original position, Minister He and Director Gu have places to consult, and I will naturally do my best to contribute or assist Minister He and Director Gu in completing their mission. If there are difficulties in any of the troops due to reorganization that should be forwarded, I will also discuss with Minister He and Director Gu to forward them to the Chairman and provide appropriate solutions. Therefore, the smooth progress of this military reorganization meeting can be asserted. Regarding the settlement of the dismissed officers and soldiers of the various troops, the army and division commanders have repeatedly stated, and I have also briefly seen it in the newspapers. I am discussing a specific method with Minister He and Director Gu and will immediately submit it to the Chairman for approval. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)

### Sheng Shicai's Representative Discussed the One-Time Turmoil in Xinjiang

The Commander of the Sixth Division was used by others, Suddenly Rebelled Against the Provincial Government, Pacified and Reorganized by Sheng Shicai

[Nanjing] Zhao Guoyuan, representative of Xinjiang Governor Sheng Shicai, arrived in Nanjing and stated that Ma Buti, commander of the Sixth Division of Xinjiang, suddenly rebelled against the provincial government, obviously used by a certain country. Two months ago, Governor Sheng Shicai deployed troops to suppress them. Ma's division was defeated and retreated towards the Indian border. At that time, the provincial army did not pursue them aggressively, still hoping for a final awakening. However, Ma Buti regrouped on the border and received a large amount of military equipment and funding from a certain country, and launched a counterattack. After several days of fighting, Ma was defeated on the 30th. Sheng resolved the situation, and all the troops of the Sixth Division were reorganized, and the situation is now calm. The Xinjiang Provincial Government is currently implementing a three-year economic plan. In addition to the fact that economic construction has certain limits, the military aspect is that Xinjiang is divided into several reclamation areas, each with a garrison of troops engaged in reclamation. In the first year of reclamation, seeds and funds are provided by the government, and the military's salary remains the same. In the second year, in addition to the salary remaining the same, seeds and funds are halved. In the third year, seeds and funds will be self-sufficient in each reclamation area, and the government will supervise. In the future, production and economic development will gradually become independent and will be able to repay the various expenses subsidized by the government. This is beneficial to the government, the army, and the people. The people of Xinjiang are of both Han and Hui ethnicities. Among the Hui people, there are Chanhui and other Hui people. The Hui people account for 85% of the province's population. Previously, provincial administration and military power were controlled by the Han people, and the Hui people had no opportunity to participate in military and political affairs. All treatments were not equal between Han and Hui ethnic groups, and they were often hostile to each other. In Xinjiang, there was a major massacre every forty years and a minor massacre every ten years. Now the politics of Xinjiang have changed, and all ethnic groups are equal. For example, the administrative head of each county has Hui people participating. The ethnic boundary has been eliminated, and massacres have not occurred in recent years. Four years ago, there were only more than 600 students in Xinjiang, and only dozens of schools. Now the number of schools has increased to more than 1,500, and the number of students has increased to 4 million, and primary school students do not have to pay tuition. The promotion of education is extremely rapid. Due to transportation reasons, most of the local products are sold to the Soviet Union, and in exchange for machinery and various items and tools. The Xinjiang Provincial Government Governor's Office does employ Soviet consultants and technicians, but there is no special political relationship with the Soviet Union. (Special Dispatch, 6th)

[Beiping] The situation in Xinjiang is chaotic, and telegrams between Beiping and Xinjiang have been blocked for many days. However, mail to Xinjiang is still being accepted and dispatched as usual, so there is a large backlog of mail in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan. (Special Dispatch, 6th)

Recently, it was reported that there has been rain in Pingxiang, and the locusts have been killed. Only Pengxian, Quzhou, and three other counties have not been cleared, and strict orders have been issued to the counties to take measures to eliminate them. (Special Dispatch, 6th)

### Ministry of Industries Announces Measures to Suppress Speculation in Exchanges

Prices of Government Bonds and Securities are Not Restricted

Nanjing: The Ministry of Industries, considering that cotton cloth, flour, miscellaneous grains, and oil cakes are all essential daily necessities for the people, and that their price fluctuations, if they exceed normal limits or are incompatible with market supply and demand, will not only affect the people's daily lives, but also may cause fluctuations in other commodity prices and the rural economy. The unanimous rise in market prices of various exchanges in Shanghai this time is unprecedented in recent years. Various industry associations and related parties in Shanghai have successively requested the establishment of measures to suppress speculation and, if necessary, to limit buying and selling prices to stabilize prices. Therefore, the Ministry, in accordance with the instructions of Premier Jiang, has successively drafted: ㊀ Twelve articles on measures to suppress speculation in the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Exchange, ㊁ Eleven articles on measures to suppress speculation in the Shanghai Exchange of Chinese Machine-Made Flour, and ㊂ Eleven articles on measures to suppress speculation in the Shanghai Exchange of Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes. All were promulgated and implemented on the 6th. As flour and wheat are the two most important commodities for the people's livelihood, the Ministry, based on the daily closing prices of each exchange last month, considered a suitable and reasonable maximum price and ordered that all future buying and selling should not exceed this maximum price. On the one hand, this will prevent speculators from having the opportunity to raise prices and manipulate the market. If there is a need to change this maximum price in the future, the Ministry will re-examine and approve it in consideration of the actual market situation. The buying and selling of government bonds and various securities are different from flour and wheat. The current social and financial situation is good, and the market is gradually becoming prosperous. The rise in government bonds is an inevitable trend, and the government has no reason to restrict prices. In addition, for commodities traded on various exchanges that are not related to the people's daily lives, there is no need to impose restrictions on their buying and selling prices. However, if there is speculation and manipulation, it should be investigated according to the law and will not be tolerated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Industry announced on the 6th the measures to suppress speculation.

### The Unfolding Situation in Sichuan Province

— Du

The Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Conference commenced yesterday in Chongqing. Chief Commissioner He Yingqin and Deputy Chief Commissioners Gu Zhutong and Liu Xiang arrived beforehand to preside over the conference. Various reorganization committee members, such as Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, Pan Wenhua, He Guoguang, Xia Douyin, and others, along with leading figures from various regions, are assisting in this grand undertaking. Military colleagues are gathered in one place, sharing the same aspirations. Never before has a conference of Sichuan generals been as organized and solemn as this. It is expected that the discussions will cover extensive and significant strategies. Not only will the military reorganization plan be implemented on schedule, but there is also hope for a renewal of the Sichuan situation. Therefore, we spare no effort in focusing our full enthusiasm on the progress of this conference.

When the military reorganization plan was first proposed, letters and envoys flew back and forth, seeking opinions. The spring clouds briefly appeared but were soon overshadowed by doubts. The complexity of the Sichuan situation made it difficult to resolve quickly, and the long distances created many obstacles. With troublemakers stirring things up, it was hard to believe that the matter could be settled. However, as the negotiations became more concrete, all parties expressed their support. The National Government even issued a clear order to establish the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee and drafted its organizational outline. Now, central government officials have arrived in Sichuan with earnest intentions, and the official conference is being convened as scheduled. Our excessive worries have been dispelled. Before He Yingqin's arrival in Chongqing, there was already a prevailing sense of optimism. There may have been room for last-minute reversals, but with the conference convened, it has reached the stage of implementing the plan, and there should be no possibility of conflicting principles. This is the first thing that makes us feel gratified. He Yingqin issued a written statement immediately after disembarking from the plane, solemnly declaring that the significance of the military reorganization lies solely in enhancing the quality of the troops. The actual number of personnel will not be reduced, and funding will not be cut. Supernumerary officers will be resettled. The central government will not insert personnel. The difference from the past is that the organization, personnel, funding, and education after the reorganization will be directly under the central government. Some generals other than Liu Xiang may not fully understand the motives for the reorganization, fearing the reduction of their subordinates and the restriction of their power. Military minds are not good at analysis, and suspicion can easily lead to misunderstandings. Now, He Yingqin has clarified everything that they are concerned about, which will surely put the generals at ease and inspire them to unite and work hard. Therefore, there should be no major obstacles at the conference table. This is the second thing that makes us feel gratified.

Regarding the merits and demerits of military reorganization, we have already published commentaries. Now, speaking specifically about Sichuan, we feel that the outcome of this conference has the potential to lead Sichuan on a path of renewal. The fact that military personnel in Sichuan have been building their own strongholds and engaging in mutual killings for a long time has created a fragmented and chaotic situation. As a result, the people are impoverished, the land is barren, the provincial treasury is depleted, and vitality is lost. Frequent disasters have made it impossible to survive. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity for generals from all sides to meet in one room, it is time to repent, reflect earnestly, abandon prejudices, and cooperate for mutual progress. We believe that the formation of all animosity is partly due to misunderstandings. If they can be open and honest and communicate regularly, there is no reason why they cannot dispel past grievances. Moreover, after the reorganization, there will be no more factions. As members of the same national army, they should think about coexisting. Sichuan is known as the Land of Abundance, with abundant resources and rich mineral deposits. Cultivation and development depend on human effort. How to utilize the assistance of the military to revive Sichuan should be thoroughly considered at this conference.

### American and British Airplanes Successfully Cross the Atlantic in Opposite Directions

Meeting in the Sky and Arriving at Their Destinations Almost Simultaneously - Scheduled Transatlantic Air Service Can Be Launched

[London] Yesterday's transatlantic trial flight by American and British airplanes marked a new page in aviation history and the beginning of scheduled flights between the United States and Britain in the future. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 6th)

[London] The significant transatlantic trial flight was successfully completed today. The 18-ton British Airways flying boat Caledonia and the Pan American Airways Sikorsky flying boat arrived safely at their destinations within minutes of each other. According to British Imperial Airways, the American Sikorsky flying boat flew 1,960 miles at an average speed of 156 miles per hour, while the British flying boat Caledonia flew 1,990 miles at an average speed of 132 miles per hour due to headwinds and fog along the way, resulting in a lower speed. (Reuters, 9th)

[London] The Pan American Airways seaplane "Pan American Clipper" and the British Imperial Airways seaplane "Caledonia" departed from Newfoundland and Foynes Island in Southern Ireland, respectively, for trial flights to establish a scheduled air service. They have now completed the northern transatlantic flight. The details are as follows:

After departing from Newfoundland, the "Pan American Clipper" landed in the waters off Foynes Island this morning at 10:47 a.m., taking a total of 12 hours and 40 minutes. Over a thousand local residents warmly cheered Captain Gray and the six other pilots. President de Valera of the Irish Free State Executive Council, Minister of Industry and Commerce Lemass, representatives from the British Air Ministry and British Imperial Airways were all waiting on land and welcomed the airmen. Captain Gray then made a speech, saying, "We had favorable winds on this trip and encountered no difficulties, which is very gratifying. We only encountered rain and clouds when flying near the coast of Southern Ireland, which made it slightly gloomy. The weather conditions along the way were consistent with the meteorological forecasts. This is a great victory for meteorologists."

After departing from Foynes Island in Southern Ireland, the Caledonia met the "Pan American Clipper" midway and flew to the waters off Newfoundland at 9:20 a.m. Suddenly, it encountered heavy fog, delaying its landing at Botwood Harbor until 10:06 a.m., taking a total of 15 hours and 11 minutes. After receiving the news, British Air Minister Lord Swinton immediately sent a telegram to Captain Wilcockson, the pilot, congratulating him, and also congratulated Captain Gray, the pilot of the Pan American Clipper.

### American Female Aviator Feared Lost in the Pacific Ocean

Naval Ships and Airplanes Search Without Success - Signals Received Are Unreliable

◎ Honolulu: Approximately 3,500 American naval personnel and radio operators are participating in the search for female aviator Oerl Har in the Pacific Ocean, along with the American aircraft carrier Lexington and four destroyers. As of tonight, the hope of finding her is very slim. (National, 6th)

[San Francisco] The Coast Guard cutter Itasca glimpsed a flare launched by aviator Oerl Har 281 nautical miles from Howland Island and immediately advanced at full speed. Upon hearing the news, people thought that Oerl Har could be rescued and celebrated. However, the Itasca sent a telegram this morning at 10:25 a.m. stating that the flare was also seen on Howland Island, or it could be a shooting star. The ship is still using searchlights and sending radio signals to continue the search. (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)

◎ Honolulu: People here are gradually believing that American female aviator Oerl Har crashed 281 miles north of Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean. The American Coast Guard cutter "Itasca" is now rushing to the rescue and is expected to arrive at its destination at 8:30 p.m. today. Whether Ms. Oerl will be rescued remains questionable. At 4:00 a.m. this morning, the destroyer "Moultray" arrived 90 miles northeast of Howland Island, and the "Swan" arrived 410 miles northeast of the island. It is now learned that Ms. Oerl crashed north of Howland, and the ships are all searching northward. (National Telegram, 5th)

### South Manchuria Railway Company's Financial Difficulties

Various New Projects Face Challenges in Progress

[Tokyo] Due to financial constraints, the South Manchuria Railway Company (Mantetsu) is facing great difficulties in undertaking various new projects. Since this year, those capable of investing in Mantetsu have not shown enthusiasm. Therefore, Mantetsu was only able to issue bonds worth 25 million yen in the first half of the year. Mantetsu relied on this amount and the 20 million yen in equity payments from the Japanese government to operate in the first half of the year. In order to realize the various projects planned for the second half of the year, Mantetsu needs 20 million yen in July, 10 million yen in August, and 20 million yen in September, totaling 50 million yen. Mantetsu is currently negotiating with banking syndicates to obtain the above funds and is trying to borrow 10 million yen to meet urgent needs. However, the banking syndicates have clearly expressed their unwillingness to lend more money to Mantetsu. Therefore, how the negotiations will proceed is noteworthy. (Central News Agency, 6th)

### Palestine Divided into Three Zones

Arabs and Jews Both Oppose

◎ Jerusalem: The United States has mobilized 8,000 troops stationed in Palestine to prevent disturbances after the committee publishes its report. The authorities have also published leaflets in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, preparing to declare martial law if necessary.

[London] Informed sources here say that the Palestine Committee is about to submit a report recommending that Palestine be divided into three parts: a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a neutral zone under British rule. According to reliable sources, the Jewish state will occupy two-thirds of the area of Palestine, with Haifa or Tel Aviv as its capital, and will be named "State of Israel." Its political system will be a republic. The remaining one-third, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Nazareth, will be designated as a British-administered area. A "corridor" from the Arab state to the coast will also be under British administration. The Arab state will include the mountainous region of Jordan, which will be governed by the local chieftain. The 250,000 Arabs scattered throughout Palestine will be forcibly relocated to the Arab state, and the relocation costs will be borne by Britain. According to informed sources, this new arrangement will be implemented on January 1, 1940. (National Hai Tong Telegram, 5th)

◎ Jerusalem: The Palestine Committee is about to submit a report recommending that Palestine be divided into three parts. Most Jewish newspapers have expressed opposition. Among the Arabs, opinions are divided. The Mufti faction opposes the partition, while the Nashashibi faction supports it. It has been learned from British sources here that, to prevent disputes when the report is published, preparations have been made to transport Egyptian troops to Palestine by plane in case of emergency. If riots occur, martial law will be declared, and the proclamation has already been printed. (National Hai Tong Telegram, 5th)

### Japanese Inspection Group Arrives in Britain - Kadono Gives Speech

Difficult to Speak Due to Competitive Position between Japan and Britain - Japan Ready to Cooperate with Britain on the China Issue

[Tokyo] The Japanese business inspection group to Britain, led by Kadono Jukuro, arrived in London on the afternoon of the 5th. The following passage from Kadono's speech to the Japanese press corps is noteworthy: "Japan and Britain are in a competitive position, making it difficult to speak. Especially on trade issues, if the remarks are not careful, they will inevitably involve the global market, which will greatly hinder Japan's developing trade. However, on the China issue, Japan is fully prepared to cooperate with Britain and believes there is room for discussion, which may lead to unexpected developments. He believes that public and private sectors in Japan have reached a consensus on acknowledging British interests in China and the possibility of a lasting partnership between Japan and Britain. He will strive to find ways to promote economic cooperation between Japan and Britain." (Central News Agency, 6th)

### New Developments in the Attitude of Various Countries Towards the Situation in Spain

Diplomatic Negotiations on Compromise Mature - Rebel Authorities Allow British Mine to Resume Operations

[London] Reuters learned today that after repeated consideration, the British government still believes that it is most appropriate for Britain and France to fill the gap after the withdrawal of German and Italian warships and take on the task of supervision, which will surely be supported by the world. The British government's previous opposition to the German and Italian plan to recognize the Spanish belligerents as having belligerent rights remains unchanged. However, it is actively seeking a solution and has proposed placing observers at Spanish ports, giving them the right to inspect all goods and foreign ships entering Spain. Although this proposal may not be agreed to by the Spanish belligerents, it may be studied by the Non-Intervention Committee. If volunteer soldiers withdraw from Spain and the war becomes a purely Spanish war, the British government will be even more willing to consider granting both sides belligerent rights. This is undoubtedly the case. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 5th)

[London] The iron ore mine in Volozera, near Bilbao, Spain, which was originally invested in and operated by a British mining company, was shut down after fighting broke out near Bilbao. Now that Bilbao has been occupied by the Spanish Nationalist forces, the British Commercial Attaché in Spain, Mr. Barker, negotiated with the Nationalist authorities. As a result, General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, has approved the British mining company to resume work at the iron ore mine. It is now learned that in addition to the British Commercial Attaché's negotiations, Mr. Bolín, General Franco's special envoy to Britain, also mediated. Mr. Bolín was formerly a London correspondent for the Spanish newspaper ABC and is currently the director of the information and propaganda department of the Nationalist government. He recently led two subordinates to Britain for a few days to try to improve relations between Britain and the Spanish Nationalist government. (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)

[Rome] There is hope for easing the international tension caused by the Spanish issue. Italian political figures have expressed their welcome. It is rumored that Italian Prime Minister Ciano may come forward to mediate, which is appropriate and would be welcomed here. Italian political figures believe that it is not difficult for Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to reach a compromise and are confident that any actions that may hinder such a compromise will be avoided by Britain.

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden recently announced in the House of Commons that the Adjustment Committee for the Non-Intervention Plan in the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to meet on the 9th of this month to discuss the new plan for maritime supervision in Spain. (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)

### French Ambassador Returns Home for Instructions Before Returning to Post and Meeting with British Foreign Secretary

Comprehensive Discussion of Overall Issues - British Ambassador Also Visits German Foreign Minister

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden met with French Ambassador Corbin this morning and had a long discussion on the new plan for maritime supervision in Spain and the overall issues of the Non-Intervention Agreement in the Civil War. It is rumored that British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson told German Foreign Minister Neurath yesterday that if foreign volunteers can withdraw from Spain, Britain intends to recognize the belligerents in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities. This needs to be denied by the British government. (Central News Agency, 6th)

[London] Regarding the Spanish issue, it is heard that the British side believes that the Spanish Civil War is now in danger of developing into an international conflict. If it is desired to limit its scope to a normal civil war, the only practical step is to withdraw all foreign volunteers currently fighting in Spain. For this reason, if the relevant countries can reach an agreement on the withdrawal of volunteers, Britain is willing to recognize the belligerents in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities. Regarding this, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin recently returned to Paris to seek instructions from his Foreign Minister Delbos and has now returned to London. He will hold talks with Foreign Secretary Eden this evening or tomorrow, at which time the situation should become clearer. According to diplomatic sources, France will likely continue to oppose recognizing the belligerents, but will definitely support Britain's firm advocacy of the withdrawal of volunteers. Therefore, according to observers, this issue may reach a compromise on the following outline: ㊀ If the maritime supervision plan cannot be maintained, then a new path must be found, replacing maritime supervision with port supervision in Spain. Observers should be stationed at all Spanish ports and have the right to board foreign ships to conduct inspections. This suggestion is sure to be approved by Germany and Italy. ㊁ After abandoning the maritime supervision system, Britain and France should resolutely insist that not only should the foreign volunteers currently fighting in Spain be withdrawn, but the principles of non-intervention and supervision should also be applied to the air force. It is heard that Germany is willing to accept the method of withdrawing volunteers, but Italy is not. As for the belligerents in the Spanish Civil War, if the London Adjustment Committee proposes to withdraw all foreign volunteers, the Valencia Republican government will surely accept it, but the Nationalist side may reject it. However, informed sources with close ties to Nationalist Commander-in-Chief General Franco say that Franco has recently changed his attitude and may be able to accept the method of withdrawing volunteers. (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)

[Berlin] Political circles here believe that British Ambassador Henderson's visit to German Foreign Minister Neurath yesterday was because the British government wanted to inquire whether Germany intends to put forward new suggestions at the next meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee. It is expected that Neurath has given a negative answer. According to political speculation, the British Ambassador's visit was purely an inquiry and did not represent the British government in putting forward any new suggestions.

### British Foreign Secretary Explains Current Situation

No German Warships Currently in the Mediterranean

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden, in answering questions from various members of parliament in the House of Commons today, explained the situation in Spain after Germany and Italy rejected the British and French supervision plans, stating that the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee decided to submit the British and French plans and the German and Italian counterproposals to all countries participating in the Adjustment Committee so that the committee could hold a plenary meeting within this week to discuss them. As for the issue of withdrawing volunteers from various countries in Spain, it is still on the agenda of the Adjustment Committee. The British government hopes that this issue can be further discussed in the near future. The Foreign Secretary then answered a question from the opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee, stating that there are currently no German warships in the Mediterranean. Conservative MP Sandy then asked, "The government previously stated that recognizing the belligerents in the Spanish Civil War as having belligerent rights does not conflict with the non-intervention policy. Is the Adjustment Committee considering using the recognition of belligerent rights as a compromise solution, but not to replace the supervision system, but only to supplement this system? Can Foreign Secretary Eden inform us of this?" The Foreign Secretary replied that the proposal is currently being discussed, but there are a large number of foreign nationals currently in Spain, thus creating a special situation in Spain. As for the recognition of belligerent rights, it is not regarded as a replacement for the entire supervision plan. (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)

### Spanish Rebels Agree to Withdraw Foreign Troops

Optimism in Paris

[Paris] According to reliable sources, General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist government, is no longer opposed to the withdrawal of foreign volunteers in Spain. French political figures recently declared that if this news can be confirmed, the international disputes caused by the Spanish issue may soon be resolved. (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)

### England and America Actively Strengthen Military Preparations

Dictatorial Countries Should Be Wary – Speech by US Ambassador to England

[London] US Ambassador to England, Bingham, recently gave a speech here on the American Independence Day, stating, “The military buildup of England and the United States is actually caused by the coercion of dictatorial countries. We hope that before the outbreak of World War II, it will serve as a warning to warmongers. Looking around the world, democratic countries are thriving, while people under dictatorial political rule are becoming increasingly impoverished and enslaved. In short, the rearmament policy of England and the United States is the greatest pillar of peace. I personally hope that within these dictatorial countries, there are still people with reason and sound minds. They must understand that if they engage in an arms race with England and the United States, the result will undoubtedly be defeat.” (Central News Agency, May 5th, Havas Dispatch)

### A Record of the International Exposition of Art and Technology (Part 2)

— Xiaoke

Now we divide the French section's buildings into three groups: specialized, regional, and colonial. There are a total of two hundred and thirty-six halls and buildings. Due to space limitations, we can only describe the general outline. Now we select the important ones and briefly describe one or two:

The specialized group includes:

Railway Building, Modern Art Building (solidly built, prepared for preservation), Printing and Publishing Industry Building, Public Education Building, Science and Invention Building, Radio Building, Travel Building, Merchant Ship Building, Aviation Building, Newspaper Office, Tavern, Hygiene Hall, etc…

Public Education Building – located in Champ-de-Mars. It is divided into elementary and advanced education, vocational education, and other groups. The first floor represents seventy-two thousand schools, including children's schools, elementary schools, high schools, and normal schools. There are many models of newly built elementary schools on display. Fifty million francs have been spent on this improvement over the past decade. Advanced education displays models of famous architectural structures in French culture, such as the National Library of Versailles, Casa Velasquez in Madrid, the University District of Ronci, and the new nursing school in Lyon. There are also handwritten manuscripts of writers during their university years. Advanced education has no spatial or temporal limits, and from the same level, it continues from elementary education and introduces the portals of various knowledge. Anyone concerned with education should not miss this place.

Science and Invention Building – As the name suggests, the things displayed in this building represent the processes of various new inventions over the years applied to modern life. We know that if there were no inventions of Voltaire and Ampere, the application of electricity would not be as widespread as it is today. Without Lavoisier's inventions, the chemical industry would not have the development it has today. Just looking at botany in the biology group, Professor Braylinham is in charge. During the exposition, he uses scientific principles to instruct the audience on all flowers in sequence. Every day at 5 pm, he uses film to popularize scientific knowledge to the public. There have also been improvements in grape cultivation in France over the past fifty years. Plant pathology also retains a large portion of the space. There is also a section for various strange dwarf plants (the so-called Japanese-style gardens), proving that future city dwellers can install a small garden at home that is laid out like a large park. Isn't this the connection between science applied to art and technology?

Women and Children's Family Hall – The organizers of the exposition did not neglect this important social issue. A total of seven pavilions were built, representing all of France's social charities for children and women. Questions about women's career inclinations and other issues can be answered and introduced. There is also a small park with all the entertainment organizations for children.

Aviation Building – located in Invalides Square and in front of its station, 180 meters long and 36 meters wide. The front protrudes into a conical and transparent shape. It displays the latest French military aircraft: Nieuport 761, Hanriot 220, Potez 63, Morane 405, Hanriot 782, and Breguet 730. At night, you can see the huge silhouettes of the planes from the outside. The top floor of the building is a large dining hall, operated by the transatlantic shipping company, the Normandy Grand Mail Ship. Outside the house, there is a small aviation parachute landing tower, 65 meters high, with safety equipment, for tourists to try landing for the first time. During the exposition, the aviation competitions include: the aviation grand review on July 14, the public aviation day on August 29, and the international aviation speed and competition race on October 3.

The famous French national tapestry factory, Gobelin, has been preparing for two years to weave 150 square meters of precious paintings for the exhibition. The factory was established in the fifteenth century and produces 65 square meters of tapestry annually. Each technician can only weave one square meter per year. Among the exhibits is a large tapestry "Peace" 5 meters 20 inches long and 4 meters wide, which will be used to decorate the new League of Nations building after the exhibition.

### Soviet Literary Giant Gorky's Letter to Mr. Sun Yat-sen

Brothers in Spirit, Comrades in Method – Hoping to Work Together to Eliminate Hatred Among People

June 18th is the anniversary of the death of the great Soviet writer Gorky. The Soviet Union held a grand memorial service nationwide. The Soviet newspapers published a letter from Gorky to Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the autumn of 1912. At that time, Gorky was the editor of the "Modern" newspaper, which had a column called "Foreign Life," and the letter was published in it. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Yixian:

I am a Russian, fighting for the victory of the same ideals as you. Wherever this ideal triumphs, I share your joy. I congratulate you on the outstanding success of your work. All conscientious people pay attention to this success, and feel happy and amazed for you—the Chinese Hercules.

We Russians also expect what you have accomplished. We are brothers in spirit and comrades in method, but the Russian government and its slaves put the Russian people in the position of enemies of the Chinese people.

We socialists, we deeply believe that people all over the world can and will live a fraternal life. Can we ignore and let greedy and stupid people promote the development of ethnic hatred, and thus perhaps cause the future of socialism to encounter dark and solid walls?

On the contrary, we will use all our strength to destroy the attempts of our enemies, the enemies of all good people in the world, who are preparing to extinguish the sun in order to carry out their dark and greedy tricks, spread hatred in the world, and suppress the enemies of the people.

We socialists must declare as often as possible that there is hatred between governments in the world, but there should be no hatred between people, this hatred is being aroused by the ruling class. Mr. Yixian, I implore you to write an article on the following topic: What is the attitude of the Chinese in general and individually towards the European capital's attempt to invade, and what is their attitude towards the actions of Russian capitalists and the Russian government? What are these actions, and what kind of opposition do they encounter from your people? If you do not have time to write it yourself, please entrust your friend to write it, and correct it yourself. When writing, please use any European language and send it to my mailing address.

I am asking you this because Russians must know about the regeneration of China from honest Chinese, and not from European journalists who serve capitalism.

I have seen the paper you wrote in "The Activities of a Socialist" and read your notes. I deeply admire you and am sure that you will be willing to answer my request. Gorky in Capri, Italy, October 28th. (TASS)

### Traitors Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu Conspire to Disrupt the Security of Tianjin and Other Places

Collecting Scattered Bandits to Form a Puppet Anti-Communist Army – Our Side is on Alert, Security is Not a Concern

Tianjin Correspondence, In the past week, there have been many rumors about security in Tianjin and its surrounding areas. At the end of last month, the Tianjin municipal authorities received a confidential report stating that traitors Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu had received 500,000 yuan in funding from a certain source to form a North China puppet anti-communist army. They were collecting two to three thousand scattered bandits to go to the border of Chahar and Suiyuan to increase the strength of the puppet army. The organization of the troops was being prepared in "Jidong." Yin Ni and Yin Ni's cronies, Li Ni Binzhang and Liu Ni Zongji, were also assisting in everything under the orders of a certain source. After departing along the Great Wall line, they would harass Tianjin and the surrounding areas of Daxing County and Lugouqiao. If they could proceed smoothly, they would unite with the spies lurking on the Pinghan Railway to harass Baoding. The Beiping municipal authorities, to guard against any eventuality, began to implement summer defense early on June 27. The inner and outer three cities were heavily guarded by the 29th Army assisting the police force. At the same time, they began searching for traitors. On the 28th and 29th, several wanted criminals were captured at the Qianmen Railway Station. All had evidence of plotting wrongdoing, further confirming the rumor that traitors were causing trouble. Tianjin is close to Beiping, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. On the evening of the 30th, Tianjin heard that Beiping and Baoding had been placed under martial law, causing considerable anxiety. However, the Tianjin local area relied on the strength of the three thousand police officers, and the deployment was very thorough. From the 1st, special precautions were taken during the summer defense period: ㊀ Joint defense was carried out with the water and sea police bureaus to ensure the safety of the Haihe waterway. ㊁ Joint defense and patrols were carried out with the police bureaus of Tianjin and Ninghe counties until the green gauze tents disappeared. According to the authorities, the security is absolutely guaranteed. (4th)

### Traitor Li Yicai Arrested in Bengbu

Bengbu Correspondence, Li Yicai, the main culprit of the Jinxiandao, who was wanted by the public, was used by a certain source to preach in Bengbu under the guise of spreading the gospel, secretly plotting wrongdoing. He was recently arrested with his partisan Zhang Yongzhen by the local garrison. After repeated interrogations, his confession was cunning. Li's followers numbered over a thousand and were quite active among the traitors. He and Gu Shuaiyuan, the main culprit of the Holy Sages Society, who was also arrested, are being held in the division headquarters.

### Foreign Nationals in Xiamen Refuse to Pay Income Tax

Japanese Nationals and Taiwanese Also Refuse Investigation – Income Tax Office Issues Another Notice Demanding Payment

Xiamen Correspondence, Foreign nationals and citizens in Xiamen refuse to pay income tax. Japanese nationals and Taiwanese citizens also refuse investigation, declaring that citizens are not obligated to pay income tax. In response, the Fujian Income Tax Office issued another notice on July 3, urging foreign nationals and citizens to pay according to regulations. If they still deliberately delay, it will be handled according to regulations. The original text of the notice reads: "The Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulate the scope of taxation, divided into three categories: Category 1: Profit-making business income, A. Profit-making income of companies, merchants, firms, factories, or individuals with capital of more than 2,000 yuan, B. Profit-making income of official-merchant joint ventures, C. Profit-making income belonging to temporary business. Category 2: Salary income of civil servants, freelancers, and others engaged in various industries. Category 3: Income from public bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, and deposit interest. The income tax on civil servants' salary income and public bond interest income has been levied since October 1st of last year, and other categories have also been levied since January 1st of this year, all of which have been ordered by our National Government to be followed. All foreign nationals, regardless of nationality, living in the Republic of China, whose source of income comes from within this province, should report and pay taxes to this office as soon as possible. However, many are still watching and hesitating, which is not in accordance with international practice. This office feels deeply regretful and hopes that all foreign nationals and citizens will deeply understand the way to cultivate friendly relations and quickly pay the income tax payable in accordance with the various provisions of our country's Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules, either by self-payment or withholding, to the Central Bank nearby, and at the same time fill out the current standard form and send it directly to this office for review and registration. Do not delay. If there is still deliberate negligence in the future, this office will handle it in accordance with the provisions of Articles 18 to 20 of the Provisional Regulations. Do not say that you were not warned. This notice is hereby issued to foreign nationals and citizens in this province." It is reported that Japanese nationals and Taiwanese citizens account for the majority of foreign nationals in Xiamen, accounting for about one-tenth of the population of Xiamen. Their income also accounts for one-tenth of the total income of Xiamen. Therefore, if they can be made to comply, there will be no problem with other foreign nationals. (4th)

### Yang Yongnian Discusses Fujian Province's Epidemic Prevention Plan, Emphasizing Fundamental Work

The Epidemic Atmosphere in Southern Fujian Turns Fierce Again – More Than 400 People Have Died in Xianyou County

Fuzhou Correspondence, Yang Yongnian, a special epidemic prevention commissioner sent by the Ministry of Health, went to Beijing to discuss the province's five-year epidemic prevention plan with the Ministry of Health. Now that the matter is over, he flew to the province on the 1st of this month with Dr. Hou Zonglian, the newly hired president of the Provincial Medical College, and nutrition expert Cheng Li. He immediately went to the provincial government to report on the results of the negotiations in Beijing. According to him, the province's five-year epidemic prevention plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan and can be started immediately. In addition to establishing a provincial epidemic prevention office in Quanzhou, a branch will be established in northern and western Fujian. The northern Fujian epidemic prevention affairs have been established in Jian'ou, and the western Fujian epidemic prevention office is planned to be established in Longyan. Offices will be established in counties with epidemics. The expenses will be jointly borne by the province and the central government. Previously, due to limited financial resources, only emergency rescue and prevention and other temporary measures could be taken. In the future, research work will be planned, and the most scientific methods will be adopted for systematic research to carry out fundamental work. As for the provincial government, Chairman Chen pays great attention to the general public's clothing, food, housing, and hygiene. Regarding housing, the Health Section of the Civil Affairs Department has built a model hygiene residence outside the Shuibu Gate in the provincial capital as an experiment. If it can meet the needs of the countryside, it can be gradually promoted to various counties. Regarding food, Cheng Li, who came with him this time, will be hired to specialize in nutrition and hygiene affairs. Mr. Yang himself is scheduled to go to Quanzhou on the 7th to inspect the provincial epidemic prevention office. On the 11th, he will go to Xiamen. On the 17th, he will take a ship to Java to attend the World Epidemic Prevention Conference in August. He will return to China at the end of August. Mr. Yang also plans to take the opportunity to inspect epidemic prevention affairs in Java to serve as a reference for our country's epidemic prevention.

In the coastal areas of southern Fujian, Fuzhou, Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, Jinjiang, and Yongchun counties, the plague was discovered in the late spring and early summer of this year and spread widely. After the government and the people worked together to prevent and control it, it subsided. However, in the past half month, it has been raining continuously, and the weather has been sultry. The epidemic atmosphere has turned fierce again, especially in Putian and Xianyou counties. In Xianyou County alone, more than 400 people have died recently. The seriousness of the situation can be imagined. The provincial government has ordered the Health Section of the Civil Affairs Department to rush personnel and medicines to put it out. (July 3)

### The Yellow River in Shandong Province Has a Strong Current

Dikes Collapsing One After Another – Officers and Soldiers Bravely Protecting Along the River

Jinan Correspondence, The Yellow River in the province has been rising sharply for several days. The water level of the Luo River is only two decimeters away from the highest record last year. Although it has gradually fallen, the current is turbulent, and the erosion of the dikes is very serious. According to a telegram received by the Construction and Defense Department on the 4th, in the first section of the south, in Li Shengcun, Puyang County, the top of the third dike and the fourth brick dike collapsed for more than ten meters. In the second section of the south, in Zhangzhuang, Licheng County, the corner of the fourth earth dike was severely eroded. In Gejiagou, Jinan City, the front of the twenty-fourth stone dike collapsed. In Xiezziwan, Bin County, the third section of the south, the twenty-third dike collapsed into the water for twenty-four meters. In Fengjia, Putai County, the fourth section of the south, the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dikes showed signs of collapse. The ninth, tenth, and seventeenth stone dikes in Wangwangzhuang were all submerged. In the second section of the north, the Luan Stone Dike of the Wulongtan Dam in Changqing County collapsed for eight meters. In the third section of the north, the upper mouth of the fourth stone dike of the Yin River in Changqing collapsed for more than seven meters. In the fourth section of the north, the third, fourth, sixth, and seventh earth dikes in Gujia, Luoyang County, collapsed for more than five meters. In the second section of the south, the first dike in Fuzhuang was eroded for thirty meters, and the upper corner of the second dike collapsed for ten meters. The situation is very tense. The Construction and Defense Office reported to the provincial government and the Yellow River Conservancy Association. At the same time, it allocated piles, rope, sacks, and stones, and ordered the soldiers to protect them. Because the dikes of Wulongtan in Changqing County were incomplete, the county magistrate was ordered to quickly repair them. As for the Huainan Dam, more than three thousand five hundred people were working on the top every day, and 50% of the work has been completed. Wang Kairu, the director of the Construction and Defense Office, went to inspect on the 3rd, guided the defense along the river, and telegraphed Kong Xiangrong of the Yellow River Conservancy Association to quickly allocate funds for the project. In the twenty-two counties along the Yellow River, in addition to Heze, Yuncheng, Feicheng, Zhangqiu, Guancheng, Huimin, and Licheng counties, the telephones were used to urge the people to defend them. The county magistrates of the remaining counties were telegraphed to quickly set up shelters for the people.

### Songjiang

The Police Station's Lost Gun Incident

The police station's lost gun, the detention of four police officers, etc., were recorded in this newspaper on the 5th. Now we have received a letter from the county police station correcting it, saying, "The news on July 5 in your newspaper that the county police station lost a gun and that four police officers were arrested is quite different from the facts. After the bureau was ordered to reorganize, the special service team's police officers were slightly transferred. After moving the houses, the team leader reported that a pistol belonging to police officer Xu Bingkui was lost. Because the case involved military supplies, police officers Xu Bingkui and Men Shu Zhu Hongsheng were first supervised. Later, it was found that police officers Jiang Fang (not yet appointed) who had passed the examination had been to the police dormitory, so they were also detained. The gun was found in the storage room of the police station. However, whether the police officers' loss of the gun was intentional or negligent is still under investigation to determine responsibility. The above-mentioned process is the fact. A letter is hereby prepared to apply for correction."

The salt industry trade union has been ordered to start organizing.

### Hefei

The Electricity Tide Mediation Breaks Down

The tide of electricity improvement here has not been resolved for half a month due to the two sides holding on. On the 2nd of this month, Yang Lüqiao and others came forward to mediate. The Hefei All-Circles Electricity Improvement Committee held a general meeting and decided on five conditions, which were handed over to Yang to meet with Gong Yangwu, the manager of the company, for discussion. Gong believed that they could not be accepted and refused. The mediation therefore broke down. The Improvement Committee is currently planning coping measures.

Lu'an Celebrates the Annihilation of the Communists

The people of Lu'an County, western Anhui, stated that the county had been ravaged by the Communists for eight years, and the city was destroyed twice. Fortunately, in the past month, Wei Lihuang, the superintendent of the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, supervised the various armies and severely suppressed them. Now they have all been wiped out. From now on, the people can emerge from the water and fire and ascend to the throne, so they initiated the organization of a meeting to celebrate the elimination of the Communists.

### Baoshan

Appealing to Exempt the House Tax

The collection of house tax in this county has been decided to be implemented from this year and has been included in the budget by the county government, totaling 4,800 yuan, which will be used for police expenses. The county chamber of commerce and other public groups believe that in addition to the 8,400 yuan that the Shanghai municipal government plans to allocate annually for police expenses, an additional 1% is charged on the deed tax, and 4% is levied on each mu of land. The burden on the people is not small. At present, they have suffered repeated disasters, and the people are in extreme difficulty. Therefore, on the 5th, they telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, appealing to them to consider the local situation and order the exemption of the tax to alleviate the people's hardships.

### Haizhou

Purchasing Machinery to Mine Mica

The Lin Hai Mica Mine Company of the third district of this county has been producing a substantial amount of mica since it began mining at Qinglong Mountain last year. However, as the mine shafts have become deeper and the mica stones larger, the company felt that relying solely on manual labor was becoming increasingly inefficient. In light of this, the company has temporarily suspended mining operations and sent staff to Shanghai to purchase machinery. Once the machinery arrives, large-scale mining will commence.

At the market in Jing'ao Street, Wenling County, on the 30th of last month, merchants from various trades gathered. The tax police team stationed at Shiqiaotou went to patrol for smuggled goods. They seized two loads of smuggled salt in the market, and the two salt smugglers fled. The tax police were unable to catch them. A tofu vendor made a flippant remark, angering the tax police, who then beat him. Seeing this, the citizens felt indignant and surrounded the tax police, leading to a clash. The tax police fired their weapons in self-defense, and the crowd dispersed. Two tax police officers suffered head injuries and lost a firearm. Three citizens, Chen Kuanjie, Chen Maofang, and Chen Damei, were injured and arrested, and on the first, they petitioned the court to examine their injuries. It is said that the perpetrators have all escaped, and the three arrested are tofu vendors.

### Danyang

Tax Police Absconds with Funds

Jin Xiaonan, a tax policeman from the county government, took a two hundred yuan promissory note from the clerk Tang Yisheng to the clerk's office for redemption on June 30th, when the clerks were settling the accounts. However, the clerk was temporarily unable to prepare the funds and paid the policeman one hundred yuan first, requesting a three-day extension for the remaining one hundred yuan. Unexpectedly, the policeman Jin Xiaonan not only did not hand over the one hundred yuan to the county government but also absconded with his luggage and the unredeemed promissory notes from various firms around dawn on July 3rd. Upon learning of this, the tax police captain ordered the police to apprehend him, but there was no news. It is reported that the county government has detained the policeman's guarantor, Mr. Ji, and ordered him to bring Jin back to justice within a limited time for punishment.

### Changshu

Cotton Fields in Shazhou Suffer Damage

Shazhou Township in the seventh district of this county is renowned for its cotton production. However, cotton thrives in dry conditions and does not tolerate moisture. Shazhou is a newly formed landmass resulting from silt deposition from the Yangtze River over the past decade or so, and the soil is mostly gravelly. This year, however, there has been frequent rainfall since the beginning of summer, causing waterlogging in the cotton fields in the Nanfeng area of the district. Coupled with the high tide in the Yangtze River, the water level in the river has increased, making drainage impossible. The cotton seedlings, which had just sprouted, have been devastated. The harvest this autumn is bound to be reduced. Currently, the farmers in the district are using water pumps to drain the fields.

### Jiaxing

County Magistrate Takes Office on a Set Date

After Wang Xianqiang, the magistrate of Jiaxing County, submitted his resignation, Weng Cheng was appointed by the provincial government to fill the vacancy. He is scheduled to arrive in He on the 10th and take office on the same day. Various agricultural, commercial, and educational groups here have telegraphed their welcome. The key personnel of various departments have been largely decided.

### Various Factors in Shanghai's Municipal Development Over the Past Decade

— Zhang Qun

Since the Treaty of Nanking was signed in 1842, Shanghai was opened as a treaty port in the following year as stipulated. As a result, this remote county on the coast leapt to become the center of foreign trade in the country. Later, during the Taiping Rebellion, Li Hongzhang used Shanghai as a base to quell the rebellion in all of Wu. Commentators believe that Shanghai's opening as a port provided the advantage of maritime transportation and the accumulation of wealth, making it easier to raise funds and procure equipment. Li's success was indeed due to this. Since then, Shanghai has often influenced the overall situation from its corner. In the 1910 Revolution, after Hanyang fell and Nanjing had not yet been recovered, the Wuchang Uprising, which started everything, was in a precarious position. In the end, Shanghai declared independence, shifting the nation's attention and laying the foundation for the Republic of China. The National Revolution of 1927 also resulted in the establishment of Nanjing as the capital and the unification of the country after Shanghai was stabilized. Moreover, due to the mix of Chinese and foreigners and earlier contact with Western civilization, in terms of culture and education, it often took the lead and became a model for the country. Shanghai's position, whether in economics, politics, military affairs, or even culture and education, is crucial to the overall situation. However, for decades, the political system's construction has failed to keep pace. During the late Qing Dynasty, only the Suzhou-Songjiang-Taicang Military Commissioner was stationed here. During the 1910 Revolution, Mr. Chen Qimei established a government here, calling himself the Shanghai Military Governor. However, in the initial stages, although the title was grand, the scale was insufficient, and it was soon abolished. After 1912, a garrison commander was established, along with a separate naval headquarters, responsible for land and sea security. For external negotiations, a special commissioner for Jiangsu negotiations was stationed here. As for municipal facilities, only the Engineering Bureau was under the jurisdiction of the garrison headquarters. It was not until 1926 that a municipal superintendent was established. Although the powers and responsibilities were more prominent and the scale was larger, Shanghai remained just one administrative district of Jiangsu Province. It was not until the establishment of the National Government in 1927 that the Shanghai Municipal Government was established, placing it in the administrative system as a local government directly under the Central Government, on par with the provincial government. Over the past ten years, despite many adversities, various construction projects have progressed smoothly. Details can be found in the administrative statistics and reports of previous years, and a quick review reveals remarkable achievements. Upon examination, there are four reasons: Tracing back to the early days of the Municipal Government's establishment, Mr. Huang Yingbai, as a pioneer of the revolution, was the first to be elected as mayor, creating systems and laws with long-term vision. He was succeeded by Mr. Zhang Boxuan, who implemented practical policies with sincerity, benefiting the people, who still remember him today. As for myself, with my limited abilities, I participated in this period, but I am ashamed to say that I made no significant contributions. Although the Greater Shanghai Plan was finalized and implemented during this time, the idea came before, and the implementation came after. I merely initiated it. Other municipal administration was also just advanced as needed to avoid falling behind. Later, Mr. Wu Tiecheng succeeded me as mayor of Shanghai, just as the January 28 Incident occurred. The aforementioned plan was inevitably greatly affected, but it was still able to proceed step by step. Although the complete picture is still pending, the framework is already complete. Indeed, Shanghai's position is important. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has been like the Fengyi and Fufeng regions, guarding the capital. Every mayor has been diligent and conscientious, striving to live up to the Central Government's trust. The progress of Shanghai's municipal administration is truly an important factor and a matter of fact, and I cannot omit it for fear of appearing biased. Secondly, Shanghai is a gathering place for people from all over the world. Citizens are exposed to modern knowledge and have more opportunities to receive it than people in the interior, thus raising the general cultural level. Moreover, with frequent contact with foreigners, a sense of national strength and weakness inevitably arises, leading to a particularly developed concept of the nation. Since the late Qing Dynasty, Shanghai citizens who sympathized with our party and worked hard for the revolution have been in the vast majority, deeply feeling the importance of national freedom and equality and believing that only revolution could achieve it. Even after the failure of the Second Revolution in 1912, Shanghai citizens showed our party the deepest sympathy. Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, they have made every effort to cooperate and support municipal construction. In my experience, the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration owes a great deal to the cooperation of its citizens. In the future, promoting municipal administration must continue to rely on this kind of cooperation as an important factor, without a doubt. Next, the Municipal Government receives instructions from the Central Government and the support of the citizens, and at the same time, it has the support of the local party headquarters and military organizations. Over the past ten years, it has faced numerous challenges, but the party, government, and military have always been closely integrated, working together through difficulties. Even with the devastation of the January 28 Incident, local order did not collapse, and construction plans did not stop. In just a few years, a brand-new city center area has been built on the ruins and trenches. This is the result of the concerted efforts of the party, government, and military. Next, the colleagues of the Municipal Government, from the heads of various bureaus downwards, mostly have specialized knowledge and are rich in administrative experience. They all regard Shanghai's municipal administration as a career, sharing weal and woe. They have swept away the bureaucratic habits of the past, and despite having higher positions and better treatment, they are unwilling to leave. As a result, the current and former mayors, such as Yu Hongjun, have all held their positions for a long time, enabling them to make the best use of their talents and abilities. Administrative efficiency has also been improved. Although the mayors have changed several times, the core personnel are sound, providing a central force for promoting municipal administration. In my opinion, the cadre-ization of the organization and the scientification of administration are the characteristics of the Shanghai Municipal Government. As for the harmonious cooperation of colleagues, that is just a bonus. This year, July 7th, marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. A special publication is being compiled, and I have been asked to contribute an article. Therefore, I am recounting the various factors in Shanghai's municipal development over the past decade to commemorate the difficulties of creation and the ease with which the masses are alerted. Ten years have passed, and a hundred years can be expected. By relying on the prosperity of the city to elevate the country to strength, I cannot help but long for it.

### Shanghai's Retrospect and Prospect

— Wu Tiecheng

1.  Shanghai and My Relationship

The city of Shanghai has a particularly deep and special relationship with me personally. Although I have already left Shanghai, I still feel a very close and profound connection with it, along with boundless concern. This is because I have served in the Shanghai Municipal Government for more than five years, which can be said to be the longest period I have worked for the Party and the country in one place and with comrades in one area. In my personal life history, Shanghai occupies a very important position, and my administration in Shanghai happened to coincide with a major catastrophe since the establishment of the city of Shanghai. The outbreak of the January 28th Incident gave Shanghai a great blow and damage. During the wartime, maintaining order and pacifying the area, comforting and rescuing victims; and after the war, recuperating and rebuilding, reviving and renewing the city, it can truly be said that I exhausted my efforts and endured great hardships. Therefore, Shanghai leaves an especially deep impression on me.

This time, the Shanghai Municipal Government is holding a grand celebration for the tenth anniversary, which makes me, who has such a close relationship with Shanghai, feel particularly happy and gratified. My joyous and encouraging emotions are beyond words.

As the old saying goes, "The deeper the love, the more eager the hope." This sentence perfectly expresses my feelings towards Shanghai. Because I love Shanghai so deeply, my expectations for Shanghai are perhaps even more ardent than those of ordinary people. Now, taking this opportunity, in addition to specially noting my sincere congratulations, I would also like to briefly state my wishes for Shanghai as a gift from me to Shanghai.

2.  The Importance of Shanghai

If we compare the city of Shanghai with a province, although its area is relatively small and its population is also relatively small, its position is quite important. And its importance has been increasing day by day since the January 28th Incident, along with the intensification of international struggles. The reason why Shanghai's position is more important than any other part of China lies in the fact that Shanghai is the gateway to all of China. The safety of Shanghai is the safety of the entire country, and every move of Shanghai can have a very significant impact on the entire nation and the entire country.

Recalling the past, I came to Shanghai to preside over municipal administration, and soon the Shanghai War broke out. The Shanghai War was something that people both Chinese and foreign in all of Shanghai never imagined. Shanghai has very complex international relations, which are intricate and check and balance each other. Therefore, not only did the citizens of Shanghai never imagine that Shanghai would have this great war, but also people in any place outside Shanghai could not have expected that Shanghai, which has these international relations, would suddenly have a war. After the war, the place suffered extreme damage. It has been more than five years until this year. For these more than five years, through the consistent efforts of all my colleagues in the Municipal Government and all the citizens of Shanghai, not only has the damage in the war zone gradually been restored to its former appearance, but we have also built the city center area. We were able to establish these achievements and receive these results in the most difficult and arduous period in Shanghai's history. It can be said that it was beyond everyone's expectations. Because of this point, it is clear that as long as we do it, as long as we work hard, without asking how difficult the process is, without asking what the future harvest will be, we will be able to work hard as much as possible and do as much as possible, and there will inevitably be many results in the future.

In the difficult and arduous period of the past five or six years, why were we all not only able to overcome the continuous difficulties, one by one, time after time; but also, in the social aspect, in the cultural aspect, and in the economic aspect, still have a little bit of achievement? This is all due to the guidance of our central government, the support of all sectors of society, and the efforts of all the citizens. However, while we are still able to feel relieved, we must still intensify our efforts. In the passive aspect, we should enable the little foundation that has been formed by the hard work of the 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai over the past five or six years to be maintained; in the active aspect, many unfinished construction projects should continue to be built continuously. And Shanghai is a gateway to our capital, so how can Shanghai be worthy of being the gateway to our capital? I am afraid that in this environment, the future work will be even more difficult than the past.

3.  My Wishes for Shanghai

Regarding the issues that should be paid attention to in future municipal administration, now I would like to provide several points based on my feelings:

A. Public Security Issue

The first is the public security issue. Shanghai's public security is very important, and public security issues can often affect the overall situation. I hope that the responsible comrades of the Shanghai military and police will still pay close attention to the public security issue in Shanghai in the future based on the experience of the past few years. At the same time, it is even more necessary for all parties to cooperate sincerely and jointly protect peace and tranquility. The reason why Shanghai's public security has not had problems in the past can be explained from three relationships:

1.  The Sincere Cooperation of the Party, Government, and Military

In the past five or six years, the Party, government, and military in Shanghai have not only had no estrangement, but also have had consistent opinions and sincere cooperation. No matter what the matter is, everyone has been completely cooperating. Therefore, no matter whether they are people within the Party or people within the government, the impression of our Party-government relationship has been very good. We cannot deny that in the past, in many places, especially in the interior, the opinions of the Party, government, and military were inconsistent and they could not cooperate, so many opinions arose, which was very unfortunate. However, in Shanghai in the past few years, everyone has been cooperating sincerely, everyone has been consistent, and everyone has been cooperating. No matter what the matter is, we have opened Party-government-military talks to jointly discuss the progress. Although the resolutions of the Party-government-military talks do not have legal effect, once we have resolved it, everyone follows it and does it. This kind of relationship of sincere cooperation between the Party, government, and military is very valuable, and I hope that it will continue to be maintained in the future.

2.  The Cooperation Between the Government and Local Organizations

The Shanghai Municipal Government has also cooperated very well with local organizations in the past. Everything has been discussed with everyone openly and honestly. Because every move of Shanghai is enough to affect the overall situation, the government and local organizations should be united and cooperate sincerely. The reason why Shanghai has been peaceful and uneventful over the years is not unrelated to this. I hope that this spirit will also be maintained in the future.

3.  The Maintenance of Friendly Relations with Foreigners in the Concessions

Shanghai has two concessions. There are forty or fifty countries of foreigners residing in Shanghai. The rights of these forty or fifty countries of foreigners often conflict with each other and cannot be reconciled. We must find ways to maintain friendly relations with the international community. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Government should regard itself as the main body in Shanghai, and treat the foreigners residing in this city as residents. We should stand in the position of the owner and take on the responsibility of protection. Before the two concessions are recovered, we cannot ignore the facts. Unnecessary disputes should be avoided as much as possible, and we must maintain friendly and cooperative relations. There are many places where the concession needs the help of the municipal government. The municipal government also has many places where it needs to cooperate with the concession under this special circumstance. Therefore, the friendly relationship between the municipal government and the two concessions must still be maintained in the future.

B. Material Construction

Next, when it comes to municipal construction, since the Shanghai War, the spiritual construction and material construction that all the colleagues of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the citizens of Shanghai have worked together for five or six years, although many have been completed, there are still many that need to continue to be worked on, and there are still many that have not been done due to funding and the situation. These works are all needed by our Shanghai. I hope that when the finances are abundant in the future, we will be able to do them one by one. Now, as far as I can remember, I will provide the "various items separately as follows:

1.  General Construction of the City Center Area

This point is most important for the construction of Greater Shanghai. We must continue to work hard step by step within the possible scope of the overall situation and finances. In particular, the development of the Qiujiang Wharf and the city center area is most related, so we should urge its early completion. Because the investment of the municipal government and the people in the city center area has reached as much as 40 or 50 million yuan, we must not only continue to maintain it, but also continue to build it to seek prosperity and development.

2.  City Museum and City Library

Although the City Museum and the Library have now been established, the content has not yet been enriched, and it must be actively improved in the future.

3.  Civil Welfare Undertakings

In the past, we all had a great ambition to improve the lives of the people of Shanghai and increase the welfare of the people. Therefore, even when the administration was extremely difficult, we still allocated a sum of money to build new civilian villages to replace the shacks. However, now only four civilian villages have been built, which can only solve one-tenth of the city's shacks. There are still many that are not enough. In the future, how should we continue to promote the construction of civilian villages to improve the lives of the people and increase the welfare of the people? It remains to be seen that we must continue to intensify our efforts.

4.  Other Social Undertakings

Over the years, the Shanghai Municipal Government has founded many cultural and social undertakings, such as establishing schools and establishing hospitals. Social and cultural undertakings are extremely important. We must complete what has not been completed. For example, Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Memorial Hospital, Mr. Wang Yiting's Memorial Pavilion in the Longhua Scenic Area, etc., we should try to complete them within the possible scope, and we will continue to promote this kind of undertaking in the future.

Because our time and financial resources are limited, we cannot take care of everything at the same time. In the past few years, because we wanted to revive the war zone and build the city center area, we did not have extra time and financial resources to do other aspects of the undertaking, so there are still many jobs that should be done but have not been done. Of course, I hope that we can take care of everything at the same time in the future and lift up all the abandoned.

C. Spiritual Construction

The above is mostly about material construction. Regarding the spiritual aspect, there are still a few points:

1.  Literacy Education

There are almost more than 400,000 illiterate people in the urban area of Shanghai. We have been running literacy education for two years, and we have only taught more than three-sevenths of the total number of people. There are still about 200,000 people waiting for us to teach them. Therefore, we still need to continue to work hard on the literacy education movement in this city in order to complete it. The concession authorities have never paid attention to the cultural and educational undertakings of the Chinese people in the concession, but we cannot but pay attention to the cultural and educational undertakings within the concession. Therefore, literacy education must still be promoted to the concession in order to improve the intellectual level of the citizens of Shanghai.

2.  Regarding the Centralized Training of Students

In the past two years, the centralized training of students in this city was held in Suzhou, which cost a lot of money and felt a lot of inconvenience. Therefore, this year, a barracks was built in Shanghai. In addition to the centralized training of students, this barracks can also be used for scout training, police training, training for all the city's principals and teachers, security team training, and civic training. The centralized training of students and civic training are very important. We must invigorate the spirit of the citizens, improve the knowledge of the citizens, rectify the discipline of the citizens, strengthen the physique of the citizens, and instill ordinary military knowledge to the citizens. We must rely on the centralized training of students and civic training, so the centralized training of students and civic training must still be paid attention to in the future. Do not abandon food because of choking due to financial difficulties.

D. Economic Construction

1.  Regarding Agricultural Production

In the future, we must find ways to improve the production technology of the farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai, increase the production of farmers, improve the livelihood of farmers, in order to supply the needs of this city. Shanghai is a large metropolis with more than a million people. The rice, wheat, cotton, vegetables, melons, beans, eggs, and even flowers consumed every day are quite a lot. These must all be supplied by the farmers of this city. I originally had a plan, but because of financial and time constraints, it has not been implemented to this day. This plan is to spend money to rent 1,000 mu of land in the urban area, such as Jiangwan or Wusong, to grow grain. Set a ten-year plan or a five-year plan, use the latest production methods, and hire local farmers to plant. This is both a production undertaking and also implies education. Use the improved new production methods to increase the knowledge of farmers. At the same time, it can also solve a part of the unemployment problem. For example, a garden can be set up in Pudong, and a vegetable garden can be set up in Zhenru. We can do these things in this way. These are all things that are related to production, related to education, and related to society. In the past, because of financial and time constraints, we have not yet started to look forward to it. It can be specifically realized in the future.

2.  Regarding the Financial Aspect

Although the financial situation has been extremely difficult in the past few years, the money spent is indeed more than in previous years. Therefore, the financial aspect must always require a fundamental solution after the collection. Finance must always have a condition. Although it cannot be spent according to income, it should not differ too much. In the future, how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, how to reorganize, is also an important issue.

3.  Regarding the Land Administration

First, we must complete the land survey, and secondly, the land administration procedures must also be improved to simplify it. Land administration is probably not easy to improve at once due to the deeply ingrained habits, but it must always be paid attention to and work hard in this direction.

Because I have a very deep feeling for the city of Shanghai, I cannot help but have particularly eager concern and hope for the city of Shanghai. The above points are all the "farewell remarks" that I gave to my colleagues when I left Shanghai this spring. Now, taking advantage of the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of Shanghai, I would like to present my feelings at that time, based on my memory, as a congratulatory gift, and sincerely pray for the bright future and development of Shanghai.

### Municipal Progress in Shanghai Over the Past Ten Years

— Yu Hongjun

Those who discussed governance in the past emphasized practical action, while those who speak of administration today prioritize efficiency. Though their methods of identifying causes and exploring results may differ, their ultimate goals are the same. Shanghai has implemented the municipal system for ten years, under the tenure of four mayors. Its initiatives have consistently drawn attention from both Chinese and foreign observers. While opinions and judgments may vary, a careful examination reveals that the achievements of these ten years are not accidental. They are the result of close coordination between the central and local governments, consistent policies in all matters, and dedicated efforts from officials at all levels, enabling steady progress to this day. As a member of the municipal government for a decade, I commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Municipal Government's establishment by summarizing key historical points for the reference of all sectors.

The city of Shanghai was established on July 7, 1927. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army had just unified the north and south. Given Shanghai's importance, it was designated a special municipality directly under the National Government. The first mayor, Mr. Huang Yingbai, a veteran of key positions, was specially appointed. During his brief two-month tenure, he formulated the organizational regulations for the Shanghai Municipal Government and essential single-item rules. He established bureaus for various administrative functions, selected talented individuals for appointments, and reorganized existing local authorities in Shanghai, such as the Hubai Engineering and Patrol Donation Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Office, and the Shanghai County Land Survey Bureau, assigning them to new bureaus. He also petitioned the National Government to delineate the municipal area. Although his tenure was brief, his pioneering work laid the foundation for Shanghai's future development. His successor, Mr. Zhang Boxuan, continued to build upon the established framework and principles, working diligently to expand the city's boundaries. He quickly resolved the issue of the municipal area's scope. He incorporated the townships and villages of Shangbao County, uniformly renaming them districts, thereby expanding the city's jurisdiction severalfold. The foundation of Greater Shanghai was firmly established during this period. When Mr. Zhang Yuejun succeeded him in April 1929, he continued to focus on practical municipal improvements, promoting benefits and eliminating abuses in all aspects. Priorities were set according to their urgency. After the old city area was largely organized, he proceeded to plan the new city area, aiming to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision of Greater Shanghai. On July 7, 1931, the cornerstone laying ceremony for the new municipal building in the city center was held. The grand scale of today's city center originated from this time. The five years from the establishment of the city to the end of 1931 can be regarded as the formative period of Shanghai.

In January 1932, Mr. Wu Tiecheng assumed the mayorship. Within weeks, he faced the tragic January 28 Incident. In the midst of adversity, he remained calm and focused on relief efforts, providing assistance to refugees and saving countless lives. Post-disaster reconstruction was a key priority, and bonds were issued to fund these efforts. Concerned about the weakness of local police forces, he established the Security Bureau in August of the same year to strengthen defense. At the same time, he continued to promote the construction of the city center. At the end of 1933, the new municipal building was completed, and the government moved in the following spring. He then focused on promoting the prosperity of the new city area and social development. Over the next year, important buildings such as the stadium, museum, library, and municipal hospital were successively completed. The National Games of 1935 were held in the newly built stadium, attracting a large crowd and marking a grand occasion. He also initiated a compulsory literacy campaign, eliminating half of the city's illiteracy within a year. New villages were built for the common people, providing clean and comfortable housing. Other initiatives included group weddings to promote thrift and the New Life Movement to reform society. These achievements are well-known and need not be repeated here. During these five years, he devoted himself to public health, welfare, and education, giving comprehensive consideration to all aspects. However, limited by the city's financial resources, many tasks remain unfinished. This stage can be regarded as the construction period of Shanghai.

In March of this year, Mr. Tiecheng was ordered to serve as chairman of Guangdong Province. I, Hongjun, have temporarily assumed his duties, aware of my limited abilities. I can only follow the guidance of the central government, adhere to the established policies of my predecessors, and seek the supervision and assistance of the city's residents. I will carefully study and implement urgent tasks such as national economic construction and local self-government within a short period of time, hoping to maintain the consistent spirit of Shanghai's administration. This would be most fortunate.

### Social Administration in Shanghai

— Pan Gongzhan

Article 14, Paragraph 1 of the Municipal Organization Law promulgated by the National Government in May 1930 stipulates that the Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for the items listed in Article 8, Paragraphs 1 to 10 of the Law. These ten items, summarized, constitute social administration, and are listed as follows: (1) Household registration and personnel registration matters; (2) Facilities for childcare, elderly care, poverty alleviation, and disaster relief; (3) Grain storage and regulation matters; (4) Improvement and protection of agriculture, industry, and commerce; (5) Labor administration matters; (6) Protection and regulation of afforestation, land reclamation, animal husbandry, hunting, and fishing; (7) Supervision of privately operated public utilities; (8) Organization and guidance of cooperatives and mutual aid enterprises; (9) Improvement of customs and morals; (10) Education and other cultural matters.

Because the city has a Bureau of Public Utilities, the aforementioned item 7 regarding the supervision of privately operated public utilities is under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Public Utilities. To facilitate handling matters, item 1 regarding household registration and personnel registration was also transferred to the former Public Security Bureau, now the Police Bureau. As for item 10 regarding education and other cultural matters, after the merger and reorganization of the city's Education Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau in October 1936, it remains one of the responsibilities of the Social Affairs Bureau. Therefore, social administration in Shanghai today mainly refers to the eight items mentioned above, excluding items 1, 7, and 10.

Under the guidance of the mayor, we serve the Shanghai Municipal Government and are responsible for the city's social administration. As mentioned above, the scope of social administration is extremely broad, covering many aspects, much like the all-encompassing meaning of the word "society" in the general public's imagination. China is advancing on the path of building a modern nation, and the trend of administrative specialization is becoming increasingly evident, with increasingly complex laws and regulations. Over the past ten years, we have implemented national policies and handled local affairs. Even a brief account of our measures would require volumes, which is beyond the scope of this article. Now, I would like to present a brief overview of the major aspects of social administration in the city, categorized into four types.

First, agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration matters. Shanghai is the most populous and commercially prosperous city in the country, but it still has 500,000 mu of cultivated land, with over 54,000 farming households, totaling about 300,000 people, relying on agriculture for their livelihood. Therefore, the improvement and protection of agriculture, industry, and commerce in the city cannot be neglected. Regarding agriculture, the primary focus is on improving crops and increasing yields. The Social Affairs Bureau has established an agricultural and forestry farm in Pudong, with experimental areas for rice, wheat, and soybeans, distributing improved seeds, guiding farmers with technology, and preventing insect pests and rice borers. The farm also cultivates a large number of seedlings, flowers, and grasses, and distributes them to citizens during the annual afforestation campaign to encourage planting, aiming to regulate the climate, improve public health, and promote the urbanization of rural areas. To promote farmers' sideline occupations, the Social Affairs Bureau has organized chicken-raising cooperatives, starting with the Gaoqiao and Luxing districts, with good results. In addition, strictly enforcing fishing vessel registration, preventing foreign vessels from encroaching on fishing grounds, studying aquatic product economics, and guiding the improvement of fishing grounds are all important agricultural policies. Regarding industry, the promotion of the new system of weights and measures was announced on July 1, 1931, unifying weights and measures in the city. Over the past six years, approximately 1.5 million measuring instruments have been inspected, and over 2,000 old instruments have been inspected and destroyed each year, not including those transferred to the courts for legal action. Unfortunately, due to obstruction by the Municipal Council in the First Special District, inspections have not yet been implemented. Other relatively important matters include the testing, research, certification, and encouragement of industrial products, as well as the establishment of industrial product standards and the registration of factories. Regarding commerce, important matters include company registration, business registration, group registration, review of practitioners, mediation of disputes, suppression of monopolies, prevention of speculation, and the compilation of commercial, financial, and price statistics.

Second, labor administration matters. Since the promulgation of the Factory Law, the city has been preparing to implement factory inspections. However, negotiations regarding factory inspections in the concessions have been delayed for a long time and have not yet been resolved, resulting in the inability to effectively implement city-wide inspections, leading to frequent factory disasters, endangering the lives of workers, and causing significant losses to industrial capital, which is truly regrettable! Labor issues are a major and important part of modern social problems. To solve them, it is necessary to study the facts first. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau has devoted considerable effort to compiling statistics on labor in the city and has achieved rich results. Over the past ten years, the following have been compiled and published regularly: (1) Statistics on wages and working hours, including "Trial Compilation of Wage Index," "Wages and Working Hours," and "Wage Rates in Shanghai," and "Statistics on Actual Income of Workers" and "Survey of Wage Systems in the City" are being compiled. (2) Survey of Workers' Living Standards: "Living Standards of Shanghai Workers" has been published, providing detailed analysis of workers' family population, age, gender, occupation, distribution of income sources and amounts, and the average household expenditure on food, clothing, housing, etc. (3) Cost of Living Index for Workers: Compiled and published in book form from 1926 to 1931, and continued to be compiled monthly since 1932, published in newspapers as a basis for resolving wage issues. (4) Statistics on Strikes and Lockouts: "Strikes and Lockouts in Shanghai in the Past Fifteen Years" has been published, and statistics continue to be compiled and published monthly. (5) Statistics on Labor Disputes: Published in special books from 1928 to 1932, and statistics continue to be compiled and published monthly. In addition, the mediation of labor disputes, the review of factory regulations, and the registration of labor unions are all handled in accordance with central government laws and regulations or the city's own regulations.

Third, social welfare administration matters. This category includes childcare, elderly care, poverty alleviation, disaster relief facilities, grain storage and regulation, the organization and guidance of cooperatives and mutual aid enterprises, and the improvement of customs and morals. The scope is broad, and a lot of funds are needed. The city is limited by its financial resources and has not been able to carry out all of them one by one. For example, childcare, elderly care, poverty alleviation, and disaster relief can only be done by supervising, improving, and assisting existing private facilities. Regarding grain regulation, although the Social Affairs Bureau has worked hard to open up sources, prevent waste, encourage hoarding, crack down on speculation, and conduct investigations and statistics, these are ultimately stopgap measures because it lacks the ability to carry out storage. Every time there is a grain shortage, it is difficult to cope. Only the consumer and sales cooperatives have made some progress in the cooperative business, and the number is gradually developing. However, although there are plans for rural credit cooperation, it has not been carried out due to financial limitations. Regarding the improvement of customs, the promotion of the New Life Movement and the holding of group weddings have been quite effective in saving the city's decadent customs.

Fourth, education administration matters. The city's education has progressed every year since the establishment of the municipal government. Detailed information is included in the municipal government reports and education statistics books, which cannot be listed here. Currently, there are municipal secondary schools, 201 elementary schools, kindergartens, and other affiliated institutions, such as the Public Education Center, the Circulation Library, the Zoo, and the Public Simple Sports Grounds, and various tutorial schools, which promote social education and are very effective. The Social Affairs Bureau has made special efforts to promote short-term elementary schools, compulsory elementary schools, and literacy education in order to eliminate illiteracy in the city. At the same time, it advocates vocational education to meet social needs. In addition, strict limitations on teachers, certification of teachers, training of private school teachers, rectification of private schools, narrowing down substandard private schools, and focusing on teacher training are all ongoing.

All of the above are important social administration matters in the city. Among them, due to the existence of the concessions, inconsistent governance, and frequent obstructions, it is sometimes not possible to carry out the various matters related to agriculture, industry, commerce, labor, education, and culture smoothly. However, we have been carrying out national policies and working hard for ten years to avoid making mistakes. As for local welfare matters, it is a pity that due to limited financial resources, there have been few achievements and little benefit. This is what I feel most uneasy about after the review.

### Reflections on the Tenth Anniversary of the Establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government

— Zhang Dingfan

Looking back to the autumn of 1927, I was honored to be appointed to lead the city of Shanghai. At that time, the military situation had just stabilized, and there was no time for construction. I tried my best, and nearly two years have passed. I am deeply ashamed that I have not achieved anything. Time flies like an arrow, and ten years have passed in a flash.

This year, July 7th, marks the tenth anniversary of the Municipal Government. A gathering was held and a special publication was compiled to commemorate the occasion. Examining the past and expanding the future is of great significance. Not considering me as ignorant and foolish, you requested an article from me. Shanghai is an internationally renowned commercial port and the economic and cultural center of the country. Its importance, the complexity of its administration, the uniqueness of its environment, and the difficulty of its measures are well-known to the people of the country. In the past ten years, thanks to the continuous efforts of the colleagues in the Municipal Government and the multi-faceted assistance of all citizens, all aspects of construction have made significant progress. This is reflected in the charts and figures in the statistics, which can be easily reviewed.

Recalling this day ten years ago, Shanghai was just beginning its reform, just a newborn baby that had just fallen to the ground. After years of nurturing, it has now reached childhood. To reach the prime of life with a healthy body, it is not far away. Following the progress of the wheels of the times, it seeks to fulfill its historical mission. This depends on the Municipal Government catching up quickly and relying on the deep cooperation of the citizens, working together with one heart and one mind, and supporting each other, in order to break through the encirclement of difficulties and enter the door of victory.

However, municipal construction is a large-scale undertaking with many details. At a time when national fortune is declining and people's livelihood is withering, it is difficult to achieve all success with one effort. It is difficult to assume the responsibility with meager strength, and it is impossible to do so. The key is to weigh the importance and urgency, identify the needs of the times and the welfare of the citizens as the main body, and determine the order. Material construction should be implemented step by step, and spiritual construction is particularly urgent. The New Life Movement is the axis of our spiritual mobilization and should be actively promoted to the entire citizenry, so that they can establish firm beliefs and generate great power. If this is the case, material and spiritual aspects will complement each other, and the people and the government will become increasingly integrated. The speed of municipal progress will compete with the passage of time, and the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Great Shanghai Plan will be guaranteed in the twentieth anniversary celebration. The inscription on the basin of King Tang of Shang says, "If you can make it new one day, renew it day by day, and again renew it." I cannot help but feel overjoyed!

### Shanghai's Finances

— Xu Fu

Shanghai is a major commercial port in East Asia and the financial center of the country. Its position is important and its environment is unique. Municipal construction is particularly important to both Chinese and foreign observers. However, to promote construction, it is necessary to strengthen financial resources first. Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, in order to complete the construction, special attention has been paid to the promotion of finance. In the past ten years, the municipal treasury's annual revenue and expenditure have increased from more than 3 million yuan to more than 10 million yuan. The gradual realization of construction plans has been pioneered by finance. The following briefly describes the financial evolution of the city for those who care about municipal affairs:

The evolution of the city's finances can be roughly divided into three periods: (1) the period of receiving and reorganizing, (2) the period of gradual advancement, and (3) the period of the impact of the incident and post-disaster revitalization. Before the establishment of the Municipal Government, the city's local finances were managed by the former Shanghai Municipal Office, Zhabei was managed by the former Hubai Engineering and Patrol Donation Bureau, and Pudong was managed by the former Tanggong Relief Bureau and Yangjing Municipal Office. The financial power was not unified, and the measures were extremely diverse. After the establishment of the Municipal Government, the Finance Bureau successively took over the finances of the former municipal agencies, merged and reorganized them, and the Municipal Government established a Financial Reorganization Committee to jointly promote progress. Various taxes and donations were gradually unified, and the burden on citizens was averaged. As a result of the reorganization, the annual revenue and expenditure in 1927 were more than 3 million yuan, and in 1927, they increased to more than 4 million yuan. The initial foundation of finance was laid at this time. This was the period of receiving and reorganizing. Later, various donations and taxes, such as house tax, vehicle tax, and ship tax, were able to gradually increase and collect more widely. In 1929, a municipal bond of 3 million yuan was issued, which was used for the construction of municipal main roads and the construction of the city center area. In addition, funds were allocated to establish the Shanghai Municipal Bank, in order to regulate finance and facilitate society, and the old road administration bridge road and Yimiao Yutuan and other public bonds were reorganized and completed, and the finances became more organized. In 1929, the annual revenue, excluding public bonds, reached more than 6.25 million yuan, and the annual expenditure was more than 6.19 million yuan. In 1930, the annual revenue was more than 7.2 million yuan, and the annual expenditure, including payments under public bonds, reached more than 9.5 million yuan, all showing a trend of advancement. This was the period of gradual advancement. Then came the January 28 Incident, and the rising finances were greatly affected. Although various taxes and revenues were gradually restored after the incident was quelled, on the expenditure side, post-disaster relief, restoring and building the city, and continuing to complete the construction of the city center area all required large sums of money. Therefore, in 1932, a disaster area reconstruction bond of 6 million yuan was issued, and in 1934, a municipal bond of 3.5 million yuan was issued. In the autumn of 1933, a temporary land value tax was launched, and in the winter of 1934, the house tax and vehicle tax rates were increased to meet the needs. In recent years, various construction projects in the city have gradually progressed. In terms of public security, security teams have been added, and attention has been paid to the promotion of sanitation and education. The financial burden has become heavier. From 1931 to 1935, the municipal treasury's annual revenue increased from more than 7.5 million yuan to more than 10.3 million yuan, and the annual expenditure increased from 9.5 million yuan to more than 12.8 million yuan. As of the end of April 1936, the municipal treasury's revenue reached more than 9.9 million yuan, and the expenditure also reached more than 9.6 million yuan. It is expected that both revenue and expenditure will exceed the previous year's figures by the end of the year. From this, we can see that the city's revenue has been reorganized effectively, but the construction is vast and the financial resources are still insufficient, so we have to rely on fundraising and allocation to meet the urgent needs. This is the period of the impact of the incident and post-disaster revitalization.

The general situation of the evolution of finances over the years has been described above. As for the reforms in financial administration in recent years, the main ones are as follows:

(1) Improving the inspection system and reorganizing tax collection. The most important thing is strictness, so the inspection system should be highly valued. The bureau originally had an inspection section, but the inspectors were stationed in various tax collection offices and were directly commanded by the directors of the offices, which could not fully perform the function of inspection. Therefore, in April 1936, the inspection powers of the entire bureau were concentrated in the bureau's inspection section, and all inspectors were distinguished, transferred to the bureau, and assigned to the inspection section for distribution and assignment. Since its implementation, it has been effective in cracking down on omissions and eliminating embezzlement.

(2) Improving the accounting system of affiliated institutions. The amount of taxes collected by the bureau's tax collection offices is very large. If the accounting personnel sent by the bureau are not responsible for registering and reporting the accounts, it will not be enough for auditing. Therefore, in August 1936, the regulations of the tax collection offices were revised, stipulating that the accounting affairs of each office should be handled by the accounting personnel selected and sent by the bureau; for the ship donation offices under the bureau, officers were also assigned to specialize in accounting affairs, in order to comply with the purpose of accounting independence and fulfill the function of auditing.

(3) Improving the house tax collection method. The city's house tax has always been collected by pre-filling out actual tickets. The pre-filling process is cumbersome, and post-audit is inconvenient; and the number of tickets returned and discarded each quarter is as high as more than 20,000, and the collectors may not be able to hide and report the situation. The loss to the municipal treasury is not small. In order to thoroughly improve and eliminate long-standing malpractices, after careful research, it was approved by the municipal government that the method of cutting-number blank receipts should be adopted from the autumn of 1936; a collection register should be created, and the collectors should collect donations according to the register, and the receipts should be cut and given to the donors temporarily. When the collectors submit the money, the tax collection offices immediately audit the tickets and money. Since its implementation, it has been easier to prevent problems such as the return of tickets and remittances, as well as the transfer of A to B, big head and small tail; it can also save the waste of discarded tickets; and the efficiency of collection has also been improved.

In short, the city's finances have been reorganized as much as possible in its own aspect. Considering the objective environment, it is different from other cities, and the promotion of finance may be hindered or need to be coordinated. In the future, we can only continue to move forward on the path of balancing revenue and expenditure, and make efforts to reduce expenditure and increase revenue, so as to concentrate financial resources on construction projects. The completion of the Great Shanghai Plan still depends on finance as the pioneer.

### Shanghai Municipality's Police Force

— Cai Jinjun

The establishment of a police organization in Shanghai began with the General Patrol Bureau of the late Qing Dynasty. In its initial stages, it was merely a rudimentary structure, comprising only about 260 patrol leaders and police officers. Although it underwent repeated changes and gradual expansion thereafter, the system remained disorganized, and the division of authority was unclear. In terms of its nature, it was simultaneously government-run and gentry-managed, and in terms of its name, there were separate county police and commercial port police within the same area. Furthermore, police affairs offices were separately established in Nanshi and Zhabei. In January of the second year of the Republic (1913), the one in Nanshi was renamed the Shanghai Commercial Port Patrol Bureau, and the one in Zhabei was renamed the Zhabei Patrol Bureau. After four months, the two bureaus were merged into the Songhu Police Department, with internal divisions into sections and external establishment of six district offices and nineteen sub-stations. In addition, it directly controlled a security police team, four patrol police teams, and a water police detective team, totaling more than 3,000 people. The following year, it was renamed the Superintendent's Office of the Songhu Land and Water Police, and the northern and southern cities were reorganized, with separate branch offices established. However, after only half a year, the old system was restored.

During the National Revolution in the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), the army established its presence in Nanjing and Shanghai. In July of that year, the Shanghai Municipal Government was established, and the police force was reorganized into the Municipal Public Security Bureau. However, with order just beginning to be established, the police force was scattered, and only about 500 officers remained. At that time, the urban area expanded, the population increased sharply, and the security police force urgently needed to be strengthened. Consequently, the four patrol police teams were reorganized into security teams, and the police officers trained in the first phase of the training institute were formed into two teams, creating a total of six security teams. In addition, there was a water patrol team, a detective team, and a military band, and externally, 2,000 police district centers and sub-stations were established. By the end of the sixteenth year of the Republic, there were 3,799 official police officers, and by the end of the nineteenth year, the number had increased to 5,033. From December of the twentieth year, after receiving the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Team, the authority of this Bureau's water patrol team was unified. However, after the January 28th Incident, the police force and equipment suffered great losses. Efforts were made to restore the force afterward, and by the end of the twenty-second year, the total number of official police officers was 5,438. By the end of the twenty-third year, the total number of official police officers had increased to 5,553. During this stage, although the scale was somewhat established, there were still many aspects of the police's poor quality and inadequate equipment that needed to be supplemented and corrected. This is the general situation of the past.

The mission of the Shanghai police, in its passive aspect, is to prevent problems before they occur and to ensure the safety of the lives and property of all citizens. In its active aspect, it is to complete the new metropolis and enhance the welfare of the lives of all citizens. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to rectify discipline and strictly enforce rewards and punishments. Moreover, one must be humble, persevering, courteous, honest, diligent, thrifty, prudent, enthusiastic, brave, unyielding to power, and unenticed by profit. One must painstakingly hone oneself amidst hardship and adversity to increase one's knowledge, experience, and abilities, and with passion and vigor, move forward bravely to serve as a model and example for all citizens. Furthermore, one must organize and train the populace to arm the populace, militarize the populace, and policize the populace so that they become one in mind and help each other in the same boat. Not only will the safety of Shanghai be guaranteed, but on a larger scale, the permanent cornerstone of national rejuvenation will be laid.

Having realized this, since taking office in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935), I have strived to reform and actively build, such as establishing a smokers' registration section to implement the prohibition of opium and drugs, establishing a New Life Movement section to actively promote the New Life Movement, adding female police officers to maximize special investigative capabilities, setting up a gun examination team to adopt scientific inspection methods, and setting up a police vehicle fleet for effective prevention of crime. These are all new creations that did not exist in the old system. Furthermore, the Supervisory Office was expanded to give full play to its supervisory and security functions, the Detective Team was reorganized to fulfill its responsibilities for investigation and arrest, and the Police General Team was expanded to meet the needs of the times. These were all present in the old system but have been improved and enriched. Currently, the internal organization of the General Bureau is divided into four sections and one office. The First Section is dedicated to general affairs, divided into seven divisions: personnel, documents, compilation, statistics, accounting, general affairs, and armaments. The Second Section handles police administrative affairs, divided into eight divisions: public security, household registration, foreign affairs, commercial affairs, health care, relief, transportation, and fire protection. The Third Section handles judicial affairs, divided into four divisions: interrogation, detention, affairs, and fingerprints. The Smokers' Registration Section is dedicated to drug prohibition affairs, divided into four divisions: licensing, investigation, inspection, and affairs. The Supervisory Office is in charge of internal and external duties, special investigation, and all security affairs, divided into eight divisions: internal duty, external duty, police affairs, training, New Life Movement, special affairs, security, and investigation. As for the external organization, the entire city is divided into eight districts, with eight branch bureaus, twenty-two police stations, thirty-four substations, and a total of one hundred and eight land and water police posts. In addition, there are also the Police General Team, the Detective Team, the Water Patrol Team, the Police Training Institute, and the Detention Center, etc. In total, there are more than 800 internal and external staff members, more than 7,000 police officers, and more than 1,000 petitioning police officers.

Today's Shanghai has become the commercial throat of the country and the central hub of the national capital. Not only are merchants gathered here, but it has also become a political center. Chinese and foreigners intermingle, and the dense population is gradually becoming a source of cultural development and a general hub for the contact of national minds. According to my ideal of a new metropolis, its form should advance daily towards order, solemnity, grandeur, and the magnificent spectacle of progress, and its spirit should contain the beautiful qualities of love, benevolence, sincerity, and peace. Therefore, in the past two years, in addition to improving the organization, expanding the police force, and strengthening the police force itself, attention has also been paid to revising the uniforms of officials and police officers, reforming case-handling procedures, eliminating student and worker movements, and eradicating corruption and local bullies. These are the most prominent aspects. In addition, the four items of training officials and police officers, investigating household registration, prohibiting opium and drugs, and promoting the New Life Movement are marked as the central tasks. This is the current situation of the city's police force.

Regarding future facilities, there are still many matters that urgently need to be improved and promoted, such as increasing the number of police officers, raising salaries, adding new equipment, and constructing suitable bureau offices. All of these are matters that cannot be delayed, but it is necessary to broadly raise funds, recruit specialists, and devote all efforts to them. Only then can the city's police administration be expected to make progress in the new era. It is my sincere hope that colleagues in the municipal government and the virtuous leaders of all sectors will provide guidance and assistance, and work together to promote its success.

Shanghai's environment is unique. As long as the concessions exist, the police power cannot be fully exercised for even a single day. Moreover, consular jurisdiction has not yet been revoked, and it is particularly difficult to manage foreigners in the urban area. Therefore, no matter how big or small the matter, one must take great pains and handle it with caution. One must have a mind as clear and bright as a sunny day after rain and reason as if one is striking gold and jade. Regardless of the myriad of principles, one must be grounded in reality and not rely on a momentary feeling or an irrational impulse to cause trouble. All difficulties will naturally be resolved easily. It is hoped that our police personnel will pay special attention to ensuring that all police administration can be rationalized and modernized to increase the trust of foreigners, so that in the future, there will be corresponding assistance in the handling of concession issues and the abolition of unequal treaties.

Everything in the past has evolved into the present, and the present will change into the future. Cause and effect are intertwined, and fortune and misfortune are interdependent, forming such a complex process. Any success is not a cause for joy but can be seen as a failure. Any failure should not be despaired of but should be strived to make it a success. As long as everyone can prepare their own strength through self-awareness and self-improvement and engage in large-scale unity to break through the current difficulties with great combined strength. It should be known that national rejuvenation is not only the enrichment of military preparations but also the common progress of efforts in all aspects of society. The contribution of the people to the country is not only the soldiers fighting at the front but also the determination and perseverance of everyone in the rear to act as their support. In the face of a serious situation and a dangerous encounter, we should break through it with the great, upright, central, and righteous spirit of the great Chinese nation and with arduous and unyielding struggle! Everyone should be a "great man who cannot be corrupted by wealth, moved by poverty, or subdued by force"! Everyone should actively "love to learn, practice diligently, and know shame" in order to advance to the realm of "wisdom, benevolence, and courage"! Regardless of any class or occupation, all the people are important members of enriching the national power. We must unite under the same ideology, the same goal, the same steps, and the same action, under the command of our highest leader, to fight against the enemy with the same hatred and make a desperate struggle! We must seek the total achievement from the individual efforts of the people throughout the country. This is the truly most reliable and greatest strength of the entire nation.

Based on my experience in serving as a police officer for three years, I deeply know that the relationship between the police and the people must be that the police do a good job, and then the people have excellent teachers and nannies. Furthermore, by training the people and organizing the people, it is possible to mold the general populace into modernized citizens. Then the entire nation can overcome all difficulties, can speak of self-existence, and can also speak of co-existence. The wind and rain are dark, but the rooster does not stop crowing. I will carefully devote my humble efforts and work doubly hard, and I hope that the gentlemen of the country will encourage each other.

### Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau

### Public Works in Shanghai Municipality

— Shen Yi

Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, under the two major guidelines of constructing a new urban area and reorganizing the old urban area, all works, such as the planning of road systems and city zoning, the construction of roads, ditches, bridges, wharves, embankments, and municipal houses, the dredging and repair of rivers and seawalls, and the supervision and control of private construction, have been implemented sequentially and actively promoted. A summary is given below:

(1) Planning of Road Systems

The construction of a modernized city requires road systems and route plans, and the planning of road systems is the basic work for constructing and reorganizing urban areas. This is because it is of utmost importance to urban traffic and the arrangement of buildings. In the past ten years, the following have been successively stipulated and announced: the main road system of the whole city, the road systems of each district of the whole city, and the routes of each road included in the road systems of each district.

(2) Planning City Zoning

In order to promote the sound development of municipal administration, the city, after considering various needs and investigating actual conditions, has divided the following areas:

㊀ Administrative Area: The central part of the city center.

㊁ Industrial Areas: Both banks of the Wusong River and the Yunzaobang River, south of Guohuo Road in Nanshi, the area along Liuying River and Hengbang River in Zhabei, and the area along the bank from Qingning Temple to Yangsi Port in Pudong.

㊂ Residential and Commercial Areas: Within the city walls of the Hubei area, south of Yu Yuan Road in Huxi, north of Hongqiao Road, west of Haige Road, and east of Kaixuan Road.

㊃ Oil Pond Area: Gaoqiao Sand

㊄ Timber Industry Area: The area along the river from the south end of the Beipiao Coal Mining Company to Jiangshan Road.

(3) Construction and Reorganization of Roads and Ditches

㊀ The main roads in the city center that connect commercial ports, wharves, railways, and traffic in various districts have been completed, including Qimei Road, Huangxing Road, Sanmin Road, Wuquan Road, Songhu Road, Shuidian Road, Zhayin Road, and part of Zhongshan North Road. The secondary roads that have been completed include the roads within the scope of the first and second reclamations and the staff reclamation. The roads within the scope of the third reclamation are under construction. The sewers under each road adopt a combined system, and preparations are being made to build sewage treatment plants at the points where the main pipes enter small rivers, using sedimentation methods to remove the sludge and discharge the remaining water into the river. All ditches and pipes in the first and second reclamations and the staff reclamation have been completely laid out, and the laying of ditches and pipes in the third reclamation is currently underway.

㊁ In the Hunan area, the original streets were mostly hardened street surfaces. In the past ten years, the main roads have been opened and reorganized in order, such as Dongmen Road, Heping Road, and the section of Guoma Road from Dongmen Road to Damatou Street, all of which have been equipped with ditches and pipes and paved with asphalt road surfaces. In addition, new ditches have been laid out at Lujiazui Road, Xietu Road, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Dapu Road, and Luban Road.

㊂ The roads in the Zhabei area are mostly paved with cobblestones. After successive renovations, Datong Road, Gonghe Road, Hengfeng Road, and a section of Baoshan Road were rebuilt with asphalt road surfaces and equipped with water pipes. After the "January 28th" Incident, the construction in the area was almost completely destroyed. Therefore, according to the prescribed plan, the routes of each road were thoroughly reorganized, and the northern section of Baoshan Road, as well as Qiujiang Road, Baoxing Road, Binchang Road, Hongdian Road, and Baoyuan Road, were rebuilt with cold asphalt road surfaces, and Shuidian Road was rebuilt with poured asphalt road surfaces. In addition, the streets in Jiangwan and Wusong were completely destroyed by the war, and they were reorganized according to the prescribed routes. For example, Songxing Road and Tongyu Road in Wusong, and Wan'an Road in Jiangwan, have all been equipped with ditches and pipes and the road surfaces have been rebuilt.

㊃ In the Pudong area, Pudong Avenue was opened and built, and Chunshan Street was reorganized. In total, 84,171 meters of asphalt roads, 3,915 meters of small square stone roads, 5,098 meters of gravel roads, 23,125 meters of cobblestone roads, and 222,071 meters of cinder roads have been built in the past ten years. A total of 189,508 meters of large and small ditches have been laid out.

(4) Construction of Bridges, Wharves, and Embankments

㊀ Bridges: The largest rivers in the city are the Huangpu River, followed by the Wusong River and the Yunzaobang River. In order to develop transportation on both banks, a total of 258 bridges have been built in the past ten years, with a total construction cost of more than 938,000 yuan. The larger ones are the Hengji Bridge, Wuzhen Bridge, Caojiadu Bridge, and Zhongshan Road No. 3 Bridge, which cross the Wusong River, and the Yunzaobang Bridge, which crosses the Yunzaobang River (the bridge was destroyed in the "January 28th" Incident shortly after its completion. Although the debris was salvaged and repaired, it can only carry vehicles weighing about six tons).

㊁ Wharves and Embankments: The city is a commercial port, and water and land transportation is extremely complicated. Foreign ships all rely on the Huangpu River, while inland river steamers mostly travel on the Wusong River. Therefore, the construction of wharves and embankments is extremely important. In the past ten years, a total of 94 wharves have been built, costing more than 320,000 yuan. A total of 3,771 meters of new embankments have been built, costing a total of more than 279,000 yuan.

(5) Municipal Buildings: Municipal buildings are roughly divided into the following four categories:

㊀ Buildings related to administrative offices: the municipal government and office buildings of various bureaus in the city center.

㊁ Buildings related to cultural and educational undertakings: sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, libraries, museums, zoos, botanical gardens, and newly built school buildings of various schools.

㊂ Buildings related to public health and public facilities: municipal hospitals, municipal Hunan hospitals, health test laboratories, Shanghai North District health offices, municipal infectious disease hospitals, municipal first cemeteries, vegetable markets in various places, Wusong Park, First Park, Confucius Temple Park, etc.

㊃ Buildings related to civilian welfare undertakings: three civilian residences, such as Quanji’an Road, Xietu Road, and Jiaotong Road, and four civilian villages, such as Zhongshan Road, Qimei Road, Pushan Road, and Taipingqiao Road. A total of 1,848 rooms.

In the past ten years, the construction cost of new municipal buildings has totaled 4,999,248 yuan and 68 cents.

(6) Rivers

The rivers in the city are intricate and mostly tidal, making them prone to siltation. In terms of water conservancy, all of them are in urgent need of dredging; however, due to limited financial resources, only selective projects can be undertaken. In the past ten years, a total of 104,031 meters of rivers have been dredged, 2,806,814 cubic meters of earth have been excavated, and a total of 687,725 yuan and 10 cents have been spent on engineering. The main projects are dredging the Wusong River, Pu Hui Tang, and dredging the wharf area in Hunan.

(7) Seawalls

The city has three seawalls, which are about 24 kilometers long. They have been in disrepair for many years and are in danger of collapsing. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works took over the seawall project in June of the eighteenth year (1929) and made overall plans. However, due to limited funds, the most dangerous parts were repaired first in June of the twenty-first year (1932) and September of the twenty-third year (1934), with a total project cost of more than 686,000 yuan.

(8) Suppression of Construction

Housing is one of the four major needs of life. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works is responsible for guiding, supervising, and suppressing the construction of the entire city. Therefore, construction companies that contract projects must register with the Bureau, and licenses of A, B, or C grades are issued according to their capital and experience so that citizens know what to choose. All buildings in the city must apply for permits in accordance with the regulations, and personnel are dispatched at any time to conduct detailed inspections. If there are any places that do not comply with the regulations, suppression is carried out repeatedly to ensure that they are consistent with the approved original plans, in order to ensure public safety. In the past ten years, the number of new houses has increased greatly, and the quality has also improved a lot. From the establishment to the end of June of the twenty-fifth year (1936), a total of 17,893 licenses were issued, with a total construction area of 4,220,260 square meters and an estimated construction cost of about 136,311,630 yuan.

In addition, houses that have been in disrepair for many years are prone to tilting and are dangerous, especially in public places. In addition to the owners taking the initiative to apply for permits to dismantle dangerous buildings in the urban area, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works first notifies them, then urges them to dismantle them. If they still do not comply, they will submit a request to the Municipal Government for approval and then dispatch workers to dismantle them on their behalf to ensure public safety. From the time of establishment to the end of June of the twenty-fifth year, a total of 670,330 square meters of old houses were dismantled.

(9) Conclusion

The construction undertakings of the city are related to the outlook of China and foreign countries, and it is difficult to simplify them due to inferiority. Therefore, the design adopts the modern urban zoning system to seek the sound development of municipal administration. At the same time, the construction of the new urban area and the reorganization of the old urban area are planned and considered together, in order to avoid any bias. The goal is to achieve the construction of a greater Shanghai. However, the jurisdiction is vast, and the financial resources are limited, so it is necessary to weigh the priorities and proceed step by step. Time flies, and ten years have passed. This is a brief account to inform the people of the country.

### A Brief History of the Evolution of Hygiene in Shanghai Municipality Over the Past Decade

— Li Ting'an

Shanghai is one of the world's commercial ports. Before the past decade, there was no modern hygiene undertaking to speak of. Epidemics were prevalent, and deaths were numerous. Cholera, in particular, was a scourge that was unavoidable every summer and autumn. It was not until August of the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926) that the modern hygiene undertaking began. Since the establishment of a dedicated agency for hygiene affairs, the tap water in Hunan and Hubei has been greatly improved, free cholera vaccination and smallpox vaccination have been carried out, hygiene education, hygiene experiments, suppression of poor food and beverages, management of medical and pharmaceutical professions, school hygiene, and promotion of maternal and infant hygiene have been initiated. All of these are essential measures to reduce disease and improve health. Over time, they have had an indelible effect on epidemic prevention and health care. In addition, what is particularly noteworthy is the progress of citizens' hygiene concepts, the increasing number of cases in which citizens ask the hygiene authorities for guidance and assistance, and the smooth implementation of hygiene laws and regulations, which can be regarded as clear evidence.

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Hygiene is in charge of the city's hygiene administration and is one of the administrative agencies directly under the Shanghai Municipal Government. It was reorganized on July 7 of the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927) after taking over the former Songhu Bureau of Hygiene. The person in charge, from July 7 of the sixteenth year of the Republic to October 5 of the twenty-first year (1932), was the former Director Dr. Hu Hongji. Because Dr. Hu died in a car accident, the Shanghai Municipal Government requested the National Government to appoint Ting'an as his successor. He took office on October 24 of the twenty-first year and has served until now. Currently, the Bureau has three sections. The First Section is divided into six divisions: Documents, Accounting, General Affairs, Pharmaceutical Management, Hygiene Education, and Life Statistics. The Second Section is divided into three divisions: Cleaning and Sanitation, General Hygiene, and Meat Inspection. The Third Section is divided into five divisions: Maternal and Infant Hygiene, School Hygiene, Labor Hygiene, Epidemic Prevention, and Medical Treatment. The Bureau of Hygiene is located in the city center, and the Municipal Hospital and Hygiene Test Laboratory are also located here. It is planned to establish hygiene offices in each district of the city to promote various works of preventive medicine, and to set up hospitals or clinics in each district to establish contact with the Municipal Hospital and promote various works of therapeutic medicine. There are also organizations such as infectious disease hospitals and smoking cessation hospitals to meet the needs of special diseases.

The construction of the Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Undertaking has been limited by funding, and there are still many things that need to be completed. However, there has been a gradual progress over the past decade. Especially after January 28, we have spared no effort to build in the midst of oddities in funding. For example, the original Wusong Hygiene Model District Office was destroyed, and the Zhabei Clinic was destroyed. Now, the Wusong District Hygiene Office and the Shanghai North District Hygiene Office have been established. The Jiangwan District Hygiene Office has also been established in the ashes of the war. In addition, permanent treatment beds were not available before January 28. Since January 28, treatment places such as the Wusong District Hospital, Jiangwan District Hospital, Infectious Disease Hospital, Drug Rehabilitation Center, Smoking Cessation Hospital, Municipal Hospital, and Shanghai South Hospital have been set up, with more than 1,100 permanent beds. The Nursing School, Shanghai South District Hygiene Office, New Hygiene Test Laboratory, and Municipal Cemetery were also opened after the January 28th Incident. As Shanghai is an area of ​​interest both at home and abroad, its hygiene undertaking is also noted by municipal administration, hygiene, medical, and other experts at home and abroad. Many public health experts who visited Shanghai have made straightforward criticisms, praising the set policy guidelines and the efforts of the work, which are beyond reproach. Therefore, the harm of epidemics has been greatly reduced, and citizens' hygiene concepts have gradually become widespread. However, various constructions and works are still in the initial stages and need to be expanded in order to achieve complete objectives. The internal reasons for this progress over the past decade are: First, the mayors of the past have attached importance to the relationship between hygiene and municipal administration and have urged them vigorously, and the various agencies under the Municipal Government have been able to cooperate and promote them. Second, the selection of employed personnel is stricter, and they are allowed to stay in their posts for a long time, so that they can be relied upon to persevere and achieve considerable progress. The summary is used to seek the guidance of the reader and to be the south needle for the future.

### Public Utilities in Shanghai

— Xu Peihuang

The establishment of public utilities in Shanghai dates back to more than forty years ago. The first to be founded was the Inland Waterworks Company, followed by the Chinese-owned Electric Power Company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Baoming, Pudong, Zhenru, Xianghua and other electric power companies, as well as the Shanghai-Taicang, Shanghai-Nanhui, Shanghai-Minhang, and Shanghai-Chuansha long-distance bus companies, which were successively established. As a result, the city gradually had adequate supplies of tap water, electricity, trams, and long-distance buses, and public utilities were roughly established. However, the shortcoming of various industries at that time was that they only paid attention to quantitative development and rarely made qualitative improvements. For example, the total daily water output of the Inland and Zhabei water plants in 1927 was only 76,800 cubic meters, which was not enough to meet the needs, and the water quality was extremely polluted, which was detrimental to health. In terms of electricity, there were as many as six power plants in the city at that time, but the power generation was not enough to meet the demand, so the power plants had to purchase electricity from foreign companies to supplement the supply. In the urban area, there were many places such as northern and western Shanghai where foreign power plants supplied electricity across the border, and the sovereignty and interests were doubly damaged. As for telephone and transportation services, the Ministry of Transportation's telephone bureau was too weak at that time, and the equipment was mostly outdated, making communication inconvenient. Therefore, there were also many places within the city where foreign telephone companies operated across the border. Furthermore, the lack of transportation in southern Shanghai and Zhabei not only inconvenienced the citizens, but also affected the development of the city.

Since the establishment of the municipal government, a Public Utilities Bureau was established to specialize in public utilities, and for the past ten years, it has been proceeding separately from the aspects of rectification and development. Fortunately, with the joint efforts of the government and business people, the city's public utilities have undergone a complete transformation. The Inland and Zhabei companies that operate tap water services have both been urged by the Bureau to add equipment. As a result, the daily water output of the Inland Company has increased to 97,000 cubic meters, and that of the Zhabei Company to 68,200 cubic meters, which is quite sufficient to supply the water demand in their respective business areas. The water quality has also been improved and is quite pure. Currently, both companies are carrying out construction projects such as adding water plants, which will increase the water output of the Zhabei Company by 35,800 cubic meters and the Inland Company by 68,000 cubic meters in the future, so the water supply should be even more adequate. The tap water in Pudong has also been planned by the Bureau over the years. The water plant was built by the Municipal Industrial Trust Company and officially started producing water on June 19th this year, with a daily output of 14,500 cubic meters. The tap water in the Wusong area was contracted to be operated by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in February 1935, after the Bureau signed a contract with the company. The Bureau's water supply department also provides water to the wharves in Xujiahui and southern Shanghai for ship use. As for the places where foreign water companies supplied water across the border in the city, except for the area where roads were built across the border in western Shanghai, which the Bureau is negotiating to recover according to the principles set by the central government, those in the Zhabei and Xujiahui areas have been negotiated and recovered, and are now supplied separately by the Zhabei and Inland companies. The pipelines are gradually becoming more widespread, so it is becoming increasingly convenient for citizens to obtain water.

The rectification of the city's electricity industry was decided by the Bureau in 1927 to unify the power plant plan. Over the past ten years, it has been carried out step by step. The total power generation capacity of the Zhabei Company has been increased to 22,500 kilowatts, the Chinese Company to 16,000 kilowatts, and the Pudong Company to 600 kilowatts. However, this is still not enough to supply the users of the five electric power companies in the city. Therefore, the Bureau urged the Zhabei and Chinese companies to expand their equipment. The Zhabei Company has added two 12,500-kilowatt generators, one of which has been completed and the other is in progress. The Chinese Company is adding two 15,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators, which are still under construction. At the same time, the Pudong Company is also building a 10,000-kilowatt power plant, and all the projects are in progress. Once the equipment of these companies is expanded and completed, the city's electricity consumption will be self-sufficient. As for the area where roads were built across the border in western Shanghai, which was originally supplied by the Shanghai Power Company across the border, the Bureau also negotiated with the company and formed a Sino-foreign joint venture, the Shanghai Western Power Company, which is supervised by the city. The city's telephone service is operated by the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession area. The rest of the area is operated by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. Five years ago, the telephone service in the city did not meet the expectations of the citizens. Recently, the bureau has expanded its equipment and replaced the manual switchboards with automatic telephones to make it convenient for citizens to use and communicate quickly. As for the telephones installed by the telephone company across the border in various parts of the city, the Bureau also negotiated with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the company. A temporary telephone contract was signed, stipulating the rights and obligations to protect sovereignty.

As for transportation, the public transportation in southern Shanghai, Zhabei, and Pudong has always been insufficient. Currently, in southern Shanghai, in addition to the Bureau urging the Chinese Electric Power Company to change the second and third tram lines to circular lines, the Bureau is also running municipal buses, and the routes extend from southern Shanghai to Caohejing and Pudong. In Zhabei, buses have also been running since 1928. The routes of the Chinese Bus Company now extend west to Zhenru and east to the Qiujiang Wharf in the city center. As for water transportation on the Huangpu River, since the Bureau established the municipal ferry, travel has gradually become more convenient.

When we talk about the city's public utilities, looking back on the past, it is roughly as described above. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the city, looking to the future, I would like to express my expectations based on what I remember. Shanghai is a major industrial and commercial city with more than 3.8 million citizens. In recent years, affected by the global economic panic, industry and commerce have long been shrouded in a slump and are in a state of decline. Now that the economic tide has shown signs of recovery, the prosperity of the city's industry and commerce will inevitably occur. Affected by this, the demand for water, electricity, and transportation will also increase. Therefore, it is an urgent task to have a good supply of public utilities.

The city currently has three tap water companies, and their locations are quite appropriate. Now, the Inland and Zhabei water plants are both expanding their equipment. It is estimated that after the project is completed, the Inland Company can increase its water output to 165,000 cubic meters, and the Zhabei Company can increase it to 104,000 cubic meters. If we calculate based on the current average daily water consumption per person, the Inland Company is 1.15 liters, and the Zhabei Company is 0.85 liters, then the Inland Company can supply a population of 1.5 million, and the Zhabei Company can supply 1.2 million people. If we estimate based on the population growth rate in the business areas of the two companies in the past ten years, then the current water output of the two companies can maintain the supply for more than ten years, and there is no need to expand in the near future. The Pudong water plant has a daily water output of 14,500 cubic meters. The area is vast and sparsely populated, and the current water demand is still small. As more construction takes place in the future, the plant will be able to exert its capacity. As for the water supply in the Zhenru area, the Bureau has also planned to provide tap water in the near future to facilitate the drinking water of the residents there.

As for the electricity industry, the Zhabei, Chinese, and Pudong power plants are currently actively expanding their equipment. It is estimated that after the prosperity of industry and commerce, the demand for electricity will increase greatly. The three major power plants should continue to expand, and attention should be paid to improving technology and business to reduce the cost of each unit of electricity, so as to reduce the price of electricity and enable citizens to obtain the most enjoyment at the lowest cost. The supply should be universal within the city, and electricity should be supplied from the city to neighboring counties to share the benefits of centralized power generation. The urgent task of the telephone service is to continue to expand the lines and universally install automatic telephones to make it convenient to install and communicate. Previously, in order to limit the telephone company from expanding telephone users in the city, a temporary contract was signed. However, for a fundamental solution, a permanent contract should be signed. Then, the problems of direct communication between the special zone and the city, and the abolition of telephone charges, can be discussed in a timely manner. Although this is the responsibility of the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, the Bureau, in order to seek the welfare of the citizens, should do its best to assist in its completion.

As for transportation, the Bureau has previously determined a five-year plan, which will be implemented step by step and in phases to improve it. The biggest shortcoming at present is the lack of connection between the north and south of the city. The method of connection is suitable for running high-speed subways or elevated trains. However, subway construction is not suitable for the city's geology, and the project is huge, requiring a lot of money, which the city's current financial resources cannot afford. As for elevated trains, the project and funding must be approved by the concession authorities. In the current situation, the connection of ground transportation is also urgently needed. However, public transportation in Zhabei is still lacking. Therefore, the Bureau is comprehensively solving the problem of how to promote convenient public transportation in Zhabei and how to connect the north and south traffic, so as to facilitate the travel of citizens and benefit both time and economy. The above is what we look forward to in the future, and it is our responsibility. We should aim for this goal and strive to achieve it. As for whether the promotion can be smooth, we hope that the citizens of the city will supervise and support us, so that Shanghai's public utilities will become more and more developed, which would be very fortunate.

### Land Administration in Shanghai

— Xu Fu

The area of the districts already taken over by the city is 530.7 square kilometers, with 786,891 mu of land, of which 529,107 mu belong to the old Shanghai County and 257,784 mu belong to the old Baoshan County. Of the old Shanghai County, 438,178 mu of household land have been surveyed and measured, and 90,929 mu have not been surveyed and measured. After the survey and measurement, 171,906 households have surrendered their old deeds and been issued land certificates. Since registration began on April 1st this year, 6,540 households have applied for registration.

Since the establishment of the municipal government, a Land Bureau has been specially established to handle land affairs, with precise designs for surveying and thorough rectification of land registration. However, because the old fish scale maps were lost early, and the existing grain registers were disorganized and confusing, lawsuits over property rights were almost daily occurrences. Due to the high land prices in the city, even a slight difference can amount to tens of millions of dollars. People compete for interests, and the registers have no clear records, making it difficult to resolve disputes, delaying the process. The rectification work has been difficult, and the progress of land administration has been slow.

The city area is divided into Shanghai and Baoshan counties. The Shanghai County part has not been re-measured since the land survey in the fifth year of Xianfeng, so there are many disputes. The current survey work is actively underway, and it is expected to be completed by the end of March next year. However, after the survey, people must look at the map to identify the boundaries themselves, sign and submit it to the bureau, and it will be confirmed if there are no objections from the neighbors. However, people are still indifferent to registration. The old deeds have not been submitted to the bureau, and the maps cannot be viewed and identified. Although the survey has been completed, the boundaries have not yet been determined. Registration is delayed, and new certificates cannot be issued. If strict supervision is not enforced to complete the work in one go, the process will be prolonged, the terrain will change, and all efforts will be wasted. Therefore, for each district that has been surveyed, the municipal committee has been consulted to send personnel to practice in order to assist in the district registration. If the trial is effective, the registration of the old Shanghai County part can be successfully completed within a few years.

The old Baoshan County part was surveyed and measured in the third year of Xuantong, and the maps and registers are complete. However, because the road foundations have not been removed in many places after road construction, and there are occasional changes in the terrain that have not been re-measured, it is easy to make mistakes if registration is based on them. Therefore, it is temporarily postponed in this area. Once the survey of the old Shanghai County part is completed, a plan will be made for the next step. If people must request registration, it can be done after the survey.

The registration of land ownership is based on the surveyed land registration, and the implementation of land policy is based on the registered status quo. In addition to reorganizing the land, we must also consider the land use problem, the housing relief problem, the estimation of land prices and fixtures, and the determination of tax rates. Therefore, after the registration is completed, we should classify and count, and determine the overall plan according to the results. We must not only ensure that farmers have their land, but also ensure that residents have their houses. Adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, so that the burden is evenly distributed and life becomes stable, is the only way to talk about land administration.

Although the Bureau has only been reorganized into the Land Bureau for more than a hundred days, it has been promoting and proceeding in accordance with the above plan based on the Land Law every day, such as the implementation of registration, the compilation of land tax registers, the promotion of land price tax, and the design of estimating standard land prices, all of which are recent important works. In the future, after the land price tax is extended to the rural areas, the land with low land prices will be lighter than the land tax. Although it affects revenue, if land administration can be implemented and it is beneficial to the citizens, we should strive to achieve it.

Today is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government, and also the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Bureau. In the past ten weeks, through the management and planning of successive mayors and directors, we have achieved today's achievements. In a few more years, all the complex problems and difficult tasks will be completely transformed into neat maps and registers. Any problem can be reviewed at a glance. All the factories, markets, residences, schools, and rural areas in the city will be set up in districts, interspersed with gardens, sports fields, and entertainment venues for citizens to rest and play. All tax rates will be fair and appropriate, affordable for the citizens, and they will be happy to pay. This is the success of the city's land administration, and the success of the Greater Shanghai Plan. Fu, as the person in charge of land administration, respectfully offers a word of congratulations to the municipal government, an announcement to the citizens, and an encouragement to his colleagues.

### Public Security in Shanghai

— Ji Zhangjian

Shanghai is one of the front lines of national defense, connecting north and south, shielding several auxiliary areas, with merchants gathering and goods converging. It is not only an important government for commerce, but also a metropolis of China. Since the January 28th Incident, the essence of the area has been tragically destroyed. The areas of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong have become ruins. After the establishment of the May 5th Truce Agreement, the bandit atmosphere in Fujian and Jiangxi became more and more rampant. Our national army stationed in Shanghai was ordered to be transferred to Jiangxi, so the defense of Shanghai became empty. At that time, the responsibility for maintaining public order was borne by the temporarily organized police force. Later, due to the vastness of the area and the hidden dangers of bandits, the municipal government, in order to consolidate defense, followed the example of Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces and requested the government to establish a Security Office to specifically assume the responsibility for public order in this area. With the approval of the Executive Yuan and the Military Commission, the Shanghai Security Office was established on August 1st, 1932. This was the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai security system.

When the Security Office was first established, it had two regiments under its jurisdiction. The First Regiment was originally the Beijing Police Brigade, which was ordered to be transferred to Shanghai and placed under the control of the municipal government to assist in maintaining public order in the city. Its initial organization was quite different from that of the army. When the Security Office was established, it was transferred to the Security Office and reorganized, and it has become what it is today. The Second Regiment originally belonged to the Sixth Regiment of the Military Police, which was ordered to be transferred to Shanghai to take on defense tasks. It was also transferred to the Security Office. The organization of the regiment was still sound. Only the team number was changed when it was transferred.

Initially, the position of Director of the Security Office was concurrently held by Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai. Later, Mayor Wu resigned from his concurrent position on October 1st of that year because he was too busy with municipal government affairs. The vacancy was succeeded by Director Yang Hu. Director Yang made many plans for Shanghai's security during his three and a half years in office. When Director Yang was promoted to Commander of the Songhu Garrison, the municipal government was approved to reorganize the Security Office into the Security General Regiment in April 1936, and Zhang Jian was appointed as the Commander of the General Regiment. Looking back on the Security General Regiment since it was ordered to reorganize, its scale and rules are roughly the same as in previous years. However, because the municipal government has been financially strained in recent years, former Mayor Wu Tiecheng has repeatedly encouraged us to economize on expenses. Since Zhang Jian took office, he has strictly followed the collective training, and all facilities are based on reducing expenditures. It is estimated that there are only more than 20 officers above the rank of warrant officer in the General Regiment.

Since the establishment of the headquarters, there have been many soldiers who have deserted, taken long leave, or are old and weak. Therefore, on September 1st, 1936, we requested to recruit soldiers to supplement the ranks, but the organization remained the same as before. This is the general situation after the reorganization of the General Regiment.

Furthermore, because the training of this unit cannot be delayed or slowed down, we have formulated an outline according to the actual situation of the unit and implemented phased training. The training scope is divided into recruit training, non-commissioned officer training, heavy weapons team training, and officer training. In order to accurately understand the progress of all units, inspections are held regularly to ensure that officers and soldiers are brave and know how to defend the territory and protect the people.

Maintaining local public order is the sole responsibility of the Security Regiment. However, Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the good and bad are mixed. Moreover, the concession is located here, and there are many obstacles in administration. Bad people hide in the concession, plotting to do evil, and guiding and dealing with them is often difficult. On September 23rd, 1936, the Japanese marine incident occurred. The situation was tense, and rumors spread. The citizens of northern Shanghai were in a state of panic. The rich moved to the concession, and the poor were startled several times a night. At that time, public order depended entirely on the Security Team and the police to maintain it, and they went to various places to inform the citizens not to easily believe rumors, so as not to expand the incident. Although the situation has now eased, we are still on alert as before and dare not slack off. Therefore, since the establishment of the General Regiment, no unexpected incidents have occurred. The mission has been well received by the public. As is customary in Shanghai, winter defense must be prepared at the end of each year. According to the winter defense orders and winter defense plans issued by the Songhu Garrison Command, vigilance is carried out, and there has been no interruption for several years. In addition, the General Regiment and the police are also responsible for the security of various airports in Shanghai, the suppression of labor and student strikes, and the special vigilance of railway stations. As for the garrison area, the troops are scattered in various places in southern and northern Shanghai, and the garrison locations are scattered like stars. Starting from the Shizilin Fort in the north and ending in Longhua in the south, the defense area is about 50 kilometers wide. Defense is set up according to the location to ensure its thoroughness, and special attention is paid to the security of Zhabei, where people live densely. The above is the actual situation of public security and administration in Shanghai in the past five years. July 7th is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. A special issue is published, and Zhang Jian is asked to contribute an article. Zhang Jian is not literate, so he recounts the experience to record the evolution.

Then, Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, saying, "Our country's thousands of years of civilization can be proven in literature. Since it is called literature, it should be presented to the public and not treasured as a secret. Moreover, when studying calligraphy and painting, we should not only view it with aesthetic eyes but also savor its meaning, perhaps emulating its fine words and deeds."

Apart from submitting a separate case to the National Government for record-keeping, we are sending the approved list by telegram in advance, as follows: Agriculture Association: Yu Zhenhui, Lin Meiyan, Ding Mocun, Zhang Sheng, Pan Hongding, Shen Ruoxu, Wu Rugui, Tang Chengzong, Lu Jingtan, Zhu Wenxiang, Wu Zijiu, Lin Kanghou; Labor Association: Lu Jingshi, Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Li Hua, Zhou Funong, Ye Xianggao, Lu Yinchu, Liu Jintai, Peng Bowei, Wang Jiyi, Ma Bolin; Commerce Association: Yu Lide, Wang Xiaolai, Guo Shun, Luo Qinghua, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Zhuang Dezhi, Shao Yanshan, Ma Jiliang, Chen Chuxiang, Chuan Zuoheng, Hu Yongqi.

Absence from the Venue Deemed as Abstention

"To the Election Supervisor of Shanghai Municipality: Regarding the supplementary methods for voting by illiterate citizens and those who are blind or disabled and unable to write, this office has reviewed and decided that each voting inspector should be responsible for reading out the names of all candidates in order, prefacing each name with the words 'Number [ordinal number],' so that illiterate citizens can circle their choices accordingly. For those who are blind or disabled and unable to write, designated personnel appointed by the election supervisor may write on their behalf, and the election inspectors should sign or affix their seals to prevent malfeasance. As for those who are too old or weak, or ill, and unable to attend the venue to vote, they should be deemed to have abstained and may not appoint a proxy.

Candidate Vacancies Will Not Be Filled

"To the Election Supervisor of Shanghai Municipality: This office previously set the end of June as the deadline for various candidates to apply to withdraw, which has been circulated separately. Now, considering that the date for the re-election is approaching very closely, and the procedures that election offices in various places must complete after receiving the list of candidates approved by this office are extensive, if the matter of replacing candidates is still delayed indefinitely, the back-and-forth communication will delay the process and inevitably cause the election period to be missed. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that after July 2nd, if vacancies occur among any of the various candidates due to any reason and replacements are required, all vacancies may be left unfilled, and there is no need to submit a request for replacements. Apart from separate circulation, this is urgently notified for your information. National Election General Headquarters, winter (no date printed)."

Recently, he came to Shanghai from West Lake, as the weather became hotter and to avoid the hustle and bustle. He temporarily resided in the He Lu of the Huisheng Society within the Baohua Temple in Dachang. The flowers and trees were lush, and the pond was surrounded by tranquility.

### Money Exchange Industry Unanimously Refuses to Exchange Fake Manchukuo Currency

Printing Forms to Implement Swearing; Civic Associations Rise Up in Opposition

The news that Japanese banks such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Bank of Chosen, and Shanghai Bank are transporting and exchanging "fake Manchukuo" Central Bank notes in Shanghai has drawn significant attention from all sectors of our country. Yesterday, reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with money exchange businesses and learned that these fake Manchukuo notes are in denominations of one, five, and ten yuan, calculated in Japanese yen (103 yen per day is approximately equal to 100 national currency). The first batch has already arrived in Shanghai and is exclusively used in Japanese stores. The association has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate member money changers, making it clear that they should unanimously refuse to exchange these notes. Once the swearing forms are printed, they will immediately swear to refuse to exchange them, and those who violate the oath will be subject to the most severe penalties. Because money changers refuse to exchange them, these notes will not flow into Chinese stores and can only be used in Japanese stores. At the same time, various Chinese stores and people have decided to refuse to use them. It was also learned that the Shanghai South Office of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association issued an emergency notice yesterday, stating that upon reading the newspaper report of the Money Exchange Association warning its members not to exchange fake Manchukuo Central Bank notes, our industry should pay particular attention. At a time when the public is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the municipal government and holding lantern festivals, it is inevitable that villains will take the opportunity to mix in and exchange with our members. We hope everyone will pay attention and avoid mistakenly exchanging them, resulting in losses. Furthermore, the 39th, 38th, and 40th district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Association of this city, based on reports that Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Bank of Chosen, Shanghai Bank and other banks in this city recently transported a large number of "fake Manchukuo" Central Bank notes to Shanghai for exchange and have entrusted six money changers to promote and exchange them, are deeply alarmed. If this matter is true, it will not only disrupt the market's finances, but also, since "fake Manchukuo" is an illegal organization, if unscrupulous merchants covet petty profits and use counterfeit currency, it would indirectly acknowledge the relationship with fake Manchukuo, which is extremely important. Therefore, after collective discussion, it was decided to first send personnel to conduct district investigations and advise merchants and residents that if such counterfeit currency is found in the market, they should refuse to use it. At the same time, they also plan to petition the party and government authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and stop it.

### Representatives of Students Studying in Japan Petitioned Xu Yesterday

Xu Immediately Telegraphed the Embassy to Rescue Them First

Ye Wenjin, a representative of various student groups studying in Japan, Yao Qianxiu, a classmate in Shanghai, and Lu Yaowu, a student who was arrested and sent back to China, visited Mr. Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, at No. 588 Rue du Père Robert, at 4 PM yesterday (the 6th). Mr. Xu, despite being ill, came downstairs to meet them and said that he was very sorry that he was unable to rescue the Chinese students who were repeatedly arrested, detained, and sent back to China by Japan recently because he was staying in the country. He didn't know if similar incidents were still happening. Mr. Ye said that Huang Yihuan (i.e., the son of Mr. Huang Keqiang), Chen Qiuhuan, and Li Yisan, among others, had recently been arrested and detained without release. Mr. Xu instructed Secretary Huang to draft a telegram to the embassy in Japan to negotiate for rescue as appropriate. While they were talking, Mr. Huang drafted the telegram, and Mr. Xu read and dispatched it immediately. Next, Mr. Ye handed over a letter from various student groups in Japan to Mr. Xu. After reading it, Mr. Xu said that he had already informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education separately when he returned to China about the areas that should be improved in the protection and management of students studying in Japan. He did not know if it had been enacted into law. Now that the situation of students studying in Japan is like this, he will specifically go to Beijing to seek a proper solution to satisfy the students' wishes. Mr. Ye also presented several points that students studying in Japan wanted to request from the authorities, divided into four items. Mr. Xu studied them one by one and agreed to study and proceed with the steps when he arrived in Beijing, and said that the third item had already been taken care of. Ambassador Xu was very concerned about the students studying in Japan and talked with the three gentlemen Ye, Yao, and Lu for about two hours. The four requests of the students studying in Japan to Ambassador Xu are recorded as follows: (1) Please forward a protest to the Japanese government from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against the arbitrary arrest and expulsion of our students studying in Japan. (2) For the currently arrested students Huang Yihuan, Chen Qiuhuan, Deng Keqiang, Li Yisan, and others, please telegram the embassy in Japan to negotiate reasonably and release them immediately. (3) Make representations to the Japanese authorities that, in the future, students should not be detained in the police station, subjected to private torture, or arbitrarily beaten and humiliated. (4) Please ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find a way to effectively protect the safety of students studying in Japan.

### National Goods Loan Syndicate Established

Eleven Banks Including the Bank of China Formed a Joint Venture; Handling Drafts and Factory Loans

The development of national goods has been extremely rapid in recent years. Since the establishment of the National Goods Joint Venture Company, the future of the national goods industry has become even more optimistic. The former National Goods Office, in view of the urgent need to seek further development of our country's national goods industry and to enrich the circulation of funds, specially negotiated with the banking industry to transport funds to support the growth of the national goods industry. The banking industry also believes that the cultivation of the national goods industry is of great importance to the national economy, so they unanimously expressed their approval. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were responsible for contacting various banks to determine the organization of a national goods banking group to concentrate their efforts. The principle has long been determined, but the total amount of funds in the banking group and the number of allocations to each bank have not been completely determined. According to reporters from the Shenzhou News Agency, due to the eager expectations of all parties, the banking group specially convened a meeting of representatives of various banks and representatives of national goods manufacturers at the Banking Association yesterday to discuss various specific issues. It was agreed that the total amount of funds in the National Goods Banking Group would be 3 million yuan, and the number of allocations to each bank would be allocated as follows: (1) Bank of China, 1 million yuan; (2) Bank of Communications, 800,000 yuan; (3) National Goods Bank, 300,000 yuan; (4) New China Bank, 200,000 yuan; (5) Four Banks Savings Society, 100,000 yuan; (6) China-South, 100,000 yuan; (7) Continent, 100,000 yuan; (8) Jincheng, 100,000 yuan; (9) Salt Industry, 100,000 yuan; (10) Shanghai, 100,000 yuan; (11) Fuyuan Money House, 100,000 yuan. Each borrowing bank will elect one or two representatives to be responsible for hosting the banking group's business, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will be designated to be responsible for drafting the silver dollar regulations. As for the general outline of the silver dollar, it has been finalized and approved, and the signing procedures will be formally implemented within the week. The main business of the banking group has been decided to be (A) handling drafts, (B) handling acceptance drafts, and (C) national goods factory loans.

### 16th Hygiene Campaign Opened Yesterday Morning

Li Tingan Reported the Significance; Yu Urged Hygiene to Save the Country

The opening ceremony of the 10th Summer Hygiene Campaign, initiated and organized by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, was held at the Municipal Public Education Hall on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Chairman Li Tingan delivered the opening remarks, stating that today is the closing day of the 16th Summer Hygiene Campaign in Shanghai. We have hygiene campaigns every year, but the results are not obvious, which is truly regrettable. The hygiene campaign is initiated by the Municipal Health Bureau and sponsored by various organs and groups such as the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This campaign is divided into four groups: publicity, epidemic prevention, inspection, and training. Each group is responsible for dispatching personnel from various organs and groups. In addition to the grand ceremony held here today, there will also be a lantern parade and a motorcade parade. The time is 5:00 PM today, gathering and departing from the Municipal Government's Wuquan Road. One is to make citizens pay attention and recognize it, and the other is to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government. At the same time, this kind of campaign cannot be undertaken by one or two people. It depends on the power of the masses and common sponsorship, so I especially hope that everyone present will not hesitate to teach us in the future. Deputy Mayor Yu, on behalf of Zheng Xuehai, delivered a training speech, stating that the significance of the hygiene campaign is nothing more than to make citizens pay attention and recognize it. If we want to save the country, we must first exercise and strengthen everyone's body, especially the power of mind, intelligence, thought, and wealth, because only when this kind of power is sound can a person's whole body be considered sound. If the people are not sound, it will affect the whole country, so if we want to revive and save the country, we must start with paying attention to hygiene. Finally, he shouted slogans. Starting at 5:00 PM, a lantern parade was held, with participants from more than 20 organs and groups such as the Health Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, the Police Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Social Bureau, the New Movement Promotion Association, the Security Committee, the Public Works Department Health Department, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Education Association, the YMCA, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, the New Pharmaceutical Industry, and the Public Education Hall. In the evening, Mayor Yu and others broadcasted their speeches.

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce Jointly with Police and Social Bureaus Reviewed the Yarn Exchange Account Books Yesterday

The Market Opened Yesterday; Yarn Prices Plummeted and Trading Was Halted

Following the administrative punishment by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for the market turmoil at the Chinese Yarn Exchange, the part concerning the suspected manipulation by public officials Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi has been handed over to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yan Shenyu, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, led the Kuang and Wang section chiefs, along with central representatives and personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Police and Social Bureaus, to re-examine the account books from related brokers yesterday morning. They extracted the account books from 9:00 AM and reviewed them at the Central District Social Bureau until 4:00 PM. Furthermore, the cotton yarn market opened yesterday, and cotton yarn prices plummeted, causing trading to be halted.

### The Times Reports New Progress in the Concession's Opium Suppression

Seriously Considering the Issue of Issuing Licenses; Agreement on Methods Must Be Discussed with the Consular Body

The Shanghai Times reported that the Municipal Council has in principle agreed to establish opium registration offices in the Public Concession. Therefore, at the meeting on June 30th, the Council appointed Chairman Fessenden, Chief of Police Jarrad, and Council Solicitor Boland to form a special committee to study the most appropriate methods for establishing the agency for the Council to adopt, and to study the agreement that the Council must conclude with the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding the opium suppression procedures of the Nanjing Government. According to reliable sources, the Council believes that the Chinese authorities should be responsible for the issuance of licenses to opium addicts in the concession, and the Council opposes the opening of licensed opium dens in the concession. In other words, although opium registration offices are established in the concession, the Council will only notify the Chinese authorities of the names of those who register, and the Council's responsibility is limited to this. Once registration offices are established in the concession, opium addicts in the concession should register at the offices, or they will suffer adverse consequences. The committee is currently considering allowing the Shanghai Municipal Government to appoint several representatives to participate in the opium registration offices in the concession. The resolution previously passed by the Council had allowed the Chinese authorities to issue licenses to opium addicts in the concession. Therefore, the committee is now seriously considering the issue of whether these licenses should be issued by the concession registration offices. It is rumored that if the funds for the concession registration offices are insufficient, they can be subsidized by the Chinese authorities, but according to those closely related to the issue, this does not seem necessary, as the expenses required for the registration offices can be covered by a portion of the registration fees. In other words, the registration fees will be paid directly to the Municipal Council, which will allocate the license fees to the Shanghai Municipal Government. Furthermore, the most complex issue that the committee must discuss is how to deal with those who violate the opium suppression laws. According to the current method, violators are sent to the First Special District Court for punishment. Yesterday, a senior official of the Council expressed the opinion that the Ward Road Prison is detaining a large number of drug offenders, and this issue will be fully discussed. It is rumored that the Council intends to hand over all drug offenders to the Chinese authorities and detain them in the Caohejing Prison. It is now known that this statement is unfounded, as the Council has not made any decision on anything other than agreeing in principle to establish registration offices in the concession. It is said that Chief of Police Jarrad's participation in the special committee may indicate that the police will play an important role in the management of the registration offices, and the registration offices may even be managed by the police. However, what requires special attention is that before the Council agrees on any methods with the Chinese authorities, it may be necessary to consult with the Consular Body.

Yesterday's Temperature Reached 94.1 Degrees; Sudden Increase in Patients at Plague Hospitals

The weather in Shanghai yesterday remained extremely hot, and there was a sharp increase in patients at various plague hospitals. The details are recorded below:

Heatwave Didn't Subside

Although there was a thunderstorm in Shanghai the night before last, it stopped soon after, so the weather yesterday was still extremely hot. According to the observatory report, the temperature rose to 94.1 degrees at noon. The roads were exposed to the scorching sun for days, causing them to melt and stick to shoes, which could be seen everywhere. Residents all suffered from the heat and tried to find ways to cool down.

Sharp Increase in Patients

Since the Shanghai Plague Hospital on Avenue du Roi Albert (Yu Qiaqing Road) opened its plague department on the 1st of this month, the number of patients admitted has been increasing daily.

### Japanese Youth Recounts Almost Falling into a Love Trap

The Horror of Being Lured by a Japanese Woman; A Poor Scholar's Comedy and Tragedy

The Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily" reported that a young man from Tokyo, 25 years old, took a vacation to Nagasaki. On the train, he met a young Japanese woman, and they had a pleasant conversation. After arriving in Nagasaki, the young man decided to pursue the woman, so they went to Shanghai together. However, before he even set foot on shore, his dream was shattered. After spending one night in Shanghai, he took the Shanghai Maru back to Japan on Sunday morning. According to the young man, he told the Japanese Consulate Police that the woman claimed to be single and willing to marry him, and said that he could easily find a job in Shanghai. He thought it was a fortunate coincidence and should not be missed, so he followed her across the sea to Shanghai from Nagasaki. During the 28-hour voyage, he felt as if he was in a paradise. However, when the ship arrived at the wharf, he first saw the woman waving a handkerchief to a man on the shore, and then saw the man board the ship to take care of her luggage. In an instant, the woman and the man came to him, and the woman happily introduced the man as her husband, and thanked him for his kindness along the way. At that time, he was stunned and speechless. After regaining his composure, he went ashore and wandered along the Bund. A police officer from the Japanese Consulate saw that he looked different and took him to the consulate. He told the whole story and said that he had no money. He pawned his watch and ring for money to stay at a Japanese hotel. The next morning, he returned to his country, feeling both funny and tragic.

### Conclusion of the Inquiry into the Workers' Horseplay Case Resulting in Death

Awaiting Sentencing

Gong Zhaolu, Li Jinfu, and Cao Changshan from Taizhou were workers in the fine yarn workshop of the Japanese-owned Yufeng Cotton Mill at 2866 Yangshupu Road. On the afternoon of May 29th, around 7 p.m., they pulled their 22-year-old colleague Miao Changwang (also from Taizhou) into a small room to engage in horseplay, pulling off his pants. Miao resisted vigorously and was injured in the abdomen. At that time, a Japanese inspector arrived, notified by child laborer Jiang Xiaojin, and they all returned to their work positions. Miao suddenly felt severe abdominal pain at midnight and was taken by someone to the Yufeng Workshop Clinic on Dinghai Road. He died at 7 a.m. the next morning. Subsequently, Gong and others paid for a coffin and encoffined the body, temporarily placing it in a deserted area of Jiangjiabang on Huade Road. Later, Dong Dexian, a Taizhou native who cooked meals for the workshop, sent a letter to the deceased's father, Miao Senxiang, in Shanghai. Miao Senxiang's entanglement with Gong Zhaolu and others broke down, and he reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. Chinese and Western detectives arrested Gong, Li, and Cao and sent them to the First Special District Court. Miao Changwang's body was exhumed for an autopsy, and it was also found that She A'er, the foreman of the fine yarn workshop at the time, also participated in pulling off Jiao Changwang's pants and putting them over his head, so Yin was added to the defendant list. The deceased's father, Miao Senxiang, hired a lawyer to file a civil suit, demanding compensation for various losses, totaling 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Dai Rongduo came to court for a continued hearing. Yin A'er hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. The judge ordered them to be remanded in custody and await sentencing.

### French Officials and Merchants Prepare to Celebrate the Anniversary of Democracy

July 14th is the anniversary of the French Democratic Republic. The French officials, gentry, merchants, scholars, overseas Chinese, and other communities in Shanghai have held enthusiastic celebrations in previous years. As the date approaches, the French Consul ordered the engineering department of the French Municipal Council to prepare for the decorations. Blacksmiths are constructing archways decorated with pine, cypress, and colorful lights in front of the French Concession and the Municipal Council on Avenue Joffre. Electric light bulbs are being hung every few feet along Avenue de la République, westward from the Bund, through Rue Massenet (Baxianqiao), Avenue Joffre, to the intersection of Avenue de la Mission (Hualong Road), in preparation for the installation of five-colored electric lights. A wooden triumphal arch with five-colored electric lights is also being erected at the entrance of the Gujiazhai Park (Hualong Road). Various lanterns and decorations are being placed inside the park, and a reed shed is being built for showing movies to entertain guests. The lanterns and decorations will be lit on the evening of the 13th. On the morning of the 14th, the French Consul and the commander of the French defense forces will hold a military parade and flag-raising ceremony in Gujiazhai Park. At noon, a celebration will be held at the French Consulate. In the evening, a dance party will be held at the French Chamber of Commerce and in the park.

### The Contribution of the Christian Literature Society to Literature

The Shanghai Municipal Museum, the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office, and collectors from various circles have launched a literature exhibition and have collected a large number of treasures. Here is a brief introduction to the books from the Christian Literature Society in the collection, in order to give visitors a full understanding, and also to let the public understand the great efforts the Christian Literature Society made in introducing Western learning and contributing to culture in the early days of the Reform Movement in China. The Christian Literature Society is tucked away in a corner of the Museum Road, specializing in religious and literary undertakings. The new era and the figures of the new era no longer pay attention. However, the editors and writers of the Christian Literature Society, such as Westerners like Timothy Richard, Young J. Allen, Williamson, Ting Tik-liang, Calvin Mateer, and Chinese like Cai Erkan, Shen Jueqi, and Zhao Jinqing, were all first-class scholars from China and the West. As for the "Wan Guo Gong Bao," "Da Tong Bao," and "Zhong Xi Jiao Hui Bao," which they sponsored in 1889, they were not only the authorities of public opinion, the pioneers of culture, and the mentors of youth at that time, but many of the writers were also giants of the Reform Movement, such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. In the culture of the past, the Christian Literature Society really fulfilled its duties as a nanny. The books published by the society that have historical value are briefly reported one by one below: (1) "The Complete Account of the Sino-Japanese War," edited by Young J. Allen and Cai Erkan, two volumes in total. The first volume of the first volume is incomplete. This book is based on accurate reports from the Chinese government at that time and historical materials from European and American intelligence agencies. It is indeed the only credible history of the Sino-Japanese War. (2) "From West to East," edited by Hua Zhian (first published in Hong Kong, then reprinted by the Christian Literature Society). This book was the only book that introduced new knowledge and Western administration to China sixty years ago. At that time, Chinese scholars were eager to read it. (3) "Universal History," compiled and translated by Li Silun from Johnston, and written by Cai Erkan, three volumes in total. This is a complete world history, not only with detailed materials, but also with beautiful writing. (4) "A General Investigation of Women's Customs in the Five Continents," compiled and translated by Young J. Allen and Ren Baoluo, ten volumes in twenty-one books in total. This book records the customs of women in various countries in great detail. Although the times have changed, there is still no women's series published in modern China that surpasses it. (5) "Children's Newspaper," edited by Mu Dasheng, a bound volume. This book is the earliest and most precious reading material for adult children. (6) "Wan Guo Gong Bao" (from 1889 to 1907), (7) "Da Tong Bao" (from 1904 to 1917), (8) "Zhong Xi Jiao Hui Bao" (from 1891 to 1917). These three magazines were the most valuable publications in early China. The writers were all famous scholars at that time, and they worked hard to impart new knowledge. (9) "New Testament" (hardcover one volume), a copy presented to Empress Dowager Cixi. (10) Three copies of the "Old and New Testaments," published by the Yinghua College in Hong Kong, translated seventy-three years ago, are also very valuable. (11) In addition, there are two volumes of Timothy Richard's posthumous works, five volumes of Morrison's Chinese-English Dictionary, and three thousand kinds of illustrations made by the Christian Literature Society in the past fifty years, which not only show the efforts of Christian scholars at that time for China, but also allow us to glimpse all the situations of Chinese society.

### A Legendary Marriage: The Sister Replaces Her Brother as the Groom

Chen Dequan Enlisted in the Army During the January 28 Incident and Never Returned; Ling Yuxian Was Unwilling to Wait in Vain and Petitioned to Cancel the Marriage

Chen Xiaoxiang, a local of Caoxi Hejing Town in the western district of the city, owned the Sensheng Lace Company. He had a son named Chen Dequan, who was about to turn thirty. When he was young, he was betrothed to Ling Yuxian of 1371 Xinshi Road, Jiangwan. Yuxian is 27 years old this year. However, Chen Dequan was a heroic man who joined the army during the January 28 Incident and has never been heard from since. His life and death are unknown. Unexpectedly, while the sound of gunfire was shaking Shanghai, Chen Xiaoxiang suddenly notified the woman's family, saying that there were many long nights and unpredictable events, so they should get married as soon as possible while they had the chance. Because both sides respected the old etiquette, the fiancé had never met her, so a funny drama like a legend occurred. They got married on April 19th of the lunar calendar that year. However, since the groom Chen Dequan was not at home at the time, Chen Xiaoxiang ordered his daughter (that is, Dequan's sister) to dress up as a man and act as the groom. They bowed to each other, drank the wedding wine, and paid respects to the parents and elders. The bride saw that the groom had a feminine air, and although he was dressed like a man, his gestures resembled a woman. After the ceremony, she returned to the room and found out that it was the sister who had replaced the brother in the marriage. She was shocked and cried out. Chen Xiaoxiang and others comforted their daughter-in-law and said that their son would return soon, so there was nothing to worry about. So the same-sex "husband and wife" lived together until the second day of the first month of the Republic of China's 22nd year. Yuxian could not remain silent and lived with her aunt for three years. Until April 27th of last year, Chen Kaoxiang falsely claimed that his son had returned, and Ling Yuxian was overjoyed and returned home, thinking that she could finally get her wish. Unexpectedly, it was still just an illusion. The anger in her heart was indescribable. She waited until now, but her husband still did not return. How could she wait in vain as a nominal wife, and how could a same-sex marriage with her husband's sister be valid? Therefore, she specially hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a lawsuit in the local court against Chen Kaoxiang, Chen Dequan, and his daughter, requesting the annulment of the illegal marriage, the dissolution of the marriage contract, compensation for damages, and consolation money. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Zhifen opened a mediation hearing to inquire about the cause, but the defendants did not arrive. The court ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed.

### Travel Agency Solicitation Meeting for Tour Groups

Recently, in order to seek wider popularity, the regulations have been revised and the benefits of members have been greatly expanded. A solicitation meeting was organized and held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao last night, with a banquet for the captains and members of each team. Li Fuhou, Miao Yonglou, Liu Shiqing, Bao Chengde, Zhang Diesheng, and others were present. During the meeting, acting president Zhou Sizhong reported the origin of the organization of the association, and then the association's manager, Bao Xianqiang, talked about the planning of a fixed clubhouse for the group. Various plans that are beneficial to the body and mind, according to the needs of the members and similar personalities, will be implemented in order, so that each member will not only obtain the greatest convenience when traveling outside, but also treat the group as a second home in peacetime. Then Shen Xingchu, the group's staff member, reported on this solicitation, which is named after the Five Sacred Mountains and the Four Famous Mountains of China, divided into nine teams: Taishan, Huashan, Songshan, Hengshan, Hengshan, Jiuhuashan, Putuoshan, Wutaishan, and Emeishan. Finally, Jin Zongcheng, the captain of the Songshan team, said on behalf of Liu Shaoping that joining the group is not only beneficial to individual travel, but also greatly contributes to the prosperity of townships and the development of national culture and transportation. Finally, Zhou Sizhong thanked the guests for their presence and support. The meeting ended at ten o'clock. It is reported that the group is scheduled to start soliciting members on July 10 and end on August 10.

### The Development of Shipping in Various Countries Drives Up the Prices of Old Ships

According to shipping industry news, in the past ten years, the shipping industry has been affected by the expansion of military preparations in various countries and the purchase of scrap iron and steel, resulting in increased shipbuilding costs and higher prices for old ships. According to a survey, the prices of several old ships are as follows: (1) The Class A single-decked "Great Victorian" freighter, weighing 5,187 tons, built in 1919, originally named "Azores," was sold for £21,500 in May 1936. It has now been sold to a Japanese company for £55,000. (2) The single-decked freighter "Seven Seas Star," originally named "Andinia," weighing 2,495 tons, built in 1920, was sold for £9,300 in January 1933. It has now been sold for £31,250. (3) The Yugoslavian Class B freighter "Prince Paul," weighing 5,263 tons, built in 1918, originally named "Florence," was sold for £13,750 in November 1934. It has now been sold in the Far East for £54,500. (4) The Greek freighter "Blankwether," weighing 4,355 tons, built in 1912, was sold for £6,750 in October 1933.

At 3:15 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, Huadong Yangshupu Road's Chinese-owned Xiangmao (also known as Lihua Chinese Soap Factory) announced new treatment conditions, which triggered a strike. Some workers injured the Chinese and Western detectives who went to suppress the situation with bricks and mud. The troublemaking workers, including Chen Daobiao, were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for punishment according to law. The day before yesterday afternoon, the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case arrested two ringleaders from Ningbo, Lu A'cai and Ruan Weny, on Ningwu Road and brought them to the Yangshupu Police Station.

### The Art & New Silk Factory Workers Sued the Factory Owner for Instigating Injury; The Court Heard The Case Again Yesterday Afternoon

Shu Guirong Attached Civil Suit Demanding Living Expenses; The Defendants Still Insisted on Their Previous Statements, Denying Instigation

Zhou Yueren, a 47-year-old man from Hangzhou, runs the Art & New Silk Factory at 41 Jinjiang Village, Dapuqiao, Xujiahui Road, French Concession. He employs many workers, all from Hangzhou and Shaoxing. Recently, Zhou was sued by worker Shu Guirong in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for instigating workers Zhao Jinshui and Wang Jinzhong to commit injury, requesting an investigation and filing a civil suit to recover monthly living expenses of 100 yuan. According to the lawsuit, on May 26th, the plaintiff and the workers in the factory had a dispute over trivial matters. Zhou Yueren immediately ordered twenty or thirty workers to use wooden sticks and iron rulers to beat the plaintiff, causing injuries and fainting before stopping. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and was admitted to Guangci Hospital, where he has been receiving medical treatment until now. He has not recovered after a long time. The plaintiff is a poor worker and has elderly parents at home who rely on the plaintiff's work income for support. Now that he has been beaten and injured, he cannot work. He requests that Zhou Yueren, Zhao Jinshui, Wang Quanzhong, etc., be punished accordingly, and that they be ordered to pay a monthly living expense of 100 yuan to the plaintiff until the plaintiff's injury is healed. Based on the lawsuit, Judge Sun Penghan opened a court hearing and summoned the parties. The plaintiff could not move due to his injury and was carried to the court on a rattan chair. He described the beating. When questioned, the defendants all denied instigating the injury.

### A Japanese Man Harasses a Chinese Maid

Li Xiaomei Files a Complaint with the Police

According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, Yoshihara Eitaro, a 28-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture, currently residing at 192 Tuqing Road, runs a photography business. Two years ago, he hired a Chinese woman, Li Xiaomei, as a maid. Li is only 29 years old and is quite beautiful. Before long, she was seduced by Yoshihara, and the relationship between master and servant turned into cohabitation. After about half a year, they had a quarrel over trivial matters, and Li left, never to return. After Li left, Yoshihara was consumed by longing for her. Not only did he lose his appetite and sleep, but he even lost his mind to work, almost like a madman. He often went out to look for Li Xiaomei's whereabouts. Until 5 p.m. on the 4th, he suddenly met her on North Sichuan Road. Yoshihara was overjoyed and immediately ordered Li to return home. Li refused. They argued on the road. Li had no choice but to twist Yoshihara to the North Sichuan Road Police Station. According to Li's statement, she had been beaten by Yoshihara and was particularly unhappy about the defendant Yoshihara's adultery. The police station notified the Consulate General and took Yoshihara to the consulate for questioning.

After searching for days, someone said that her husband was working as a weed puller at Longhua Airport, so she went to look for him. However, she was refused entry due to strict security. The woman returned with tears in her eyes. The day before yesterday, her child suddenly died, causing her great sadness and misery.

### New-Style Rickshaws Began Operating in the City Center Yesterday

Fifty Rickshaws Available Today

The Public Utilities Bureau has manufactured fifty new-style rickshaws to facilitate traffic in the city center. Manufacturing began in mid-May. It was originally planned to put them into service in early August, but due to the 10th anniversary celebration of the Municipal Government, traffic was insufficient. The rickshaws were completed ahead of schedule, so the newly manufactured rickshaws appeared in the central area yesterday. Today, fifty rickshaws will be fully operational. The style of these vehicles is generally similar to chartered cars, but the body is painted blue, and the side panels are trimmed in black, making the colors very harmonious. They are also equipped with odometers, costing four cents per mile, so there is no need for customers to haggle over the price. However, these vehicles are not allowed to cross the Songhu Railway and can only operate in the city center. The rental fee is six yuan per month, which is different from the daily rental fee for ordinary rickshaws, making it much more convenient for the rickshaw pullers. Blue cloth uniforms have also been made. Rickshaw pullers must wear them to avoid being bare-chested, which would be unsightly.

### Xin Fu Bank's Shanghai Branch Declares Closure Yesterday Morning

Based on the Board of Directors' Resolution on the 5th, the Settlement Method will be Determined by the Shareholders' Meeting

### The Pavilion Buildings of Shanghai

— Hua Ling

The pavilion building can be said to be a unique building in Shanghai. Although some people say that some are not worthy of the name, because the pavilion is named, but it does not fly in fact. However, the pavilion building has nearly twenty years of history in Shanghai, and in terms of the current situation, as long as Shanghai exists for one day, the pavilion building will always follow and will not disappear, because the lovers of pavilion buildings are really not a few in Shanghai.

Although the status of the pavilion building is above the kitchen and below the drying platform, and it always opens windows to the north, with cold winters and hot summers as its characteristics, however, the pavilion building is not without its advantages. Its biggest advantage is silence. If the door is closed, it is completely isolated from the other neighbors in the same shikumen. Therefore, some people used to say that "at least half of those who hide beauties in golden houses in Shanghai prefer to use pavilion buildings as golden houses." Although this is a bit of an exaggeration, it is said that hiding beauties in pavilion buildings is indeed a wonderful way to prevent spring scenery from leaking out.

Don't look at the ordinary pavilion building, which is only about 100 square feet, and it is so small. In the pavilion buildings of Shanghai, there are full small families living everywhere. The rent of an ordinary pavilion building is always in the range of four or five yuan to seven or eight yuan, which is just enough for those with meager monthly income. Therefore, there are many new couples who have just formed small families and are spending their honeymoon in the pavilion buildings.

Many impoverished writers also use pavilion buildings as writing places, because in the middle of the night, the surroundings are obviously infinitely silent. There is no sound of mice gnawing things, no snoring from the neighbors, and no crying of children. At this time, it is a good time to pour out their hearts and write quickly in order to exchange for living expenses tomorrow.

But in recent years, in the pavilion buildings of Shanghai, some have rented to manufacture drugs, some have rented to harbor kidnappers, or rented to do other illegal activities, so the mystery of the pavilion buildings is becoming more and more great.

### In the Rice Paddy

— Chen Liang

The villagers have planted the rice seedlings well, so neatly, row by row, plant by plant, standing in the water, the rice seedlings are emerald green and lovely. Running outside the village, the view is endless. Although there are a few cotton and bean fields mixed in the middle, because they are also emerald green, they feel quite harmonious. Summer is originally a season of lush green fields, with willow shade at the roadside and reed marshes by the beach, lining a green wilderness.

People who go to the countryside for outings may feel a different kind of "rural scenery." Sitting on a privately owned or public long-distance bus, the springy leather cushions are soft and comfortable, and looking out the window at the vast rice paddies beside the highway, the gentle breeze blows the slender and weak rice seedlings, and the sun shines on the water surface, reflecting a silvery mirror-like luster. Frogs hide under the rice seedlings and sing songs of midsummer. It only increases the beauty of sight and sound, however, this kind of beauty is built on the hard work of the farmers.

The scenery of the rice paddy is indeed pleasant, but the farmers alone know the hardship of transplanting rice seedlings. Bare-chested and bending over, with their backs facing the sky, they are baked by the scorching sun, turning into a deep orange color, almost like the roasted pigs in the city. They either lie on the waterwheel to water the rice seedlings, or transplant rice seedlings in the field. The water is forced by the sunlight to emit water vapor, which熏s the face and mixes with sweat. How uncomfortable.

Even more uncomfortable are the leeches in the rice paddies. They have sharp heads and are best at maneuvering, shrinking and stretching in the mud, with an ugly and frightening appearance. The farmers have bare legs and feet, stepping in the paddy field, their legs buried in the mud. The leeches have a maneuvering object and use their sharp heads to drill straight into the flesh. Because at first they only feel numb and itchy, they don't pay attention. After they feel pain, most of the leech has already drilled in. They can't pull it out, and if they pull it hard, it will break inside. The leeches live by sucking blood in the muscles, and the poor farmers have to be exploited by these small insects.

There is a local method, it is said that only oil needs to be applied, and when half of the leech has drilled in, tapping the muscles with your hand will also make it retreat. I once saw a farmer's leg bitten by four or five leeches, and the blood was dripping. Therefore, during the rice transplanting season, people are afraid to go to the field barefoot. Only a few can afford "water shoes." But for the sake of life, there is no way. Urban women are fashionable in summer to expose their legs and bare feet, because they don't have to go to the rice paddies to be bitten by leeches. Compared, the bitterness and joy are naturally worlds apart.

### Another Letter to Rong'er (Part Two)

— Zhou Shoujuan

Your brother Zheng has been ordered to go to Zhenjiang for military training since May 1st, making the home even more desolate. If Er was here, it wouldn't be like this. In the past two months, I have received more than twenty letters, detailing his life, saying that no matter how hard the work is, he will gladly go to it and dare not be lazy, and he often encourages himself to serve the country. Each letter is three or four pages long, like a lover writing a love letter, chattering endlessly, but never a word about Er. I suspected that he was indifferent to fraternal love, but it was not so. When I read his letter to your sister Ling, the pain and mourning were overflowing. I realized that the reason why he didn't mention Er in his letters to me was probably because he was afraid of rekindling my grief. During these two months, I went to Zhenjiang twice to visit, and I was relieved to see that your brother was as healthy as ever. According to both brothers, he has been dreaming of Er lately, as happy as in life. So, is Er also thinking of his brother so much that he goes to visit him from time to time? What I find difficult to bear is that I remember a year ago, Er also came to Zhenjiang to participate in the National Boy Scout Jamboree, showing his bravery and activity. But now he is sleeping under Lingyan, a dead man. Looking at the present and thinking of the past, how can I not be heartbroken!

In mid-May, the county's entire Boy Scout troop, as usual, held its annual camp. I still remember the day after last year's camp, I came to the public sports field with your mother and your younger siblings to see what Er was doing. At that time, Er was lying in the camp tent after dinner, lifting the curtain and looking like a duck, smiling. This scene is still vivid as yesterday. This time, when I saw the Boy Scouts marching into the field, I suddenly remembered the past, tears welled up in my eyes, and I lowered my head and walked around. Alas, alas, my heart is not stone, how can I bear to go through the sports field again?

Usually, your mother treats your seven brothers and sisters equally, never favoring one over another. Whenever there are snacks, she always divides them equally among you, like Chen Ping dividing meat, striving for fairness. The other day, I brought back cakes from Shanghai, and your mother was happy and still divided them into seven equal portions. Suddenly, she remembered that Er had passed away and could no longer enjoy this food, so she secretly shed tears for him. When Dragon Boat Festival came around again, your mother followed the custom of making zongzi, and she remembered that Er had always loved this food, but now he could no longer eat it. Unexpectedly, her heart ached and her hands trembled, and the rice in the basket fell down, almost stopping the process. Alas, Rong'er, all these trivial things, the reason why I don't mind being verbose and want to tell Er everything is that I want Er to reflect on his momentary recklessness, which caused his parents endless pain. How will he face his parents? If Er knows, will he also regret it?

Your uncle works on the Longhai Railway, and he has been unable to return home for more than ten years due to his busy schedule. Now, upon hearing of Er's death, he suddenly returned home at the beginning of the month, and he held my hand sadly, unable to say a word. More than ten years ago, Uncle came to Shanghai once, and Er was just learning to speak. Now he can't see Er grow up, but only stares at Er's portrait obsessively. Your uncle also said that in early March, about a week before Er's death, Er sent a letter to Xianyang to greet him. This was the first letter in more than ten years, and also Er's last letter, but he never mentioned it to me. Did Er know that his end was approaching, and wanted to leave a memento with your uncle?

Since I published the previous letter, letters of condolences have poured in from friends from all over the world, all saying that I should not dwell on mourning, so as not to make Er even more uneasy under the spring. Mr. Yu Kongwo of the Xinwenbao also wrote an article in the newspaper, advising me to shed fewer tears. Furthermore, Mr. Mai Gongsan, an old friend of mine from Shenbao for thirty years, sent a letter from Hanao, more than a thousand words, discussing Buddhism in detail, using repeated metaphors to relieve my grief. My dear friend Mr. Wang Yizhi, who is currently a guest in the Netherlands, also comforted me from thousands of miles away with a postal tube, and gave me a copy of "Bao'er's First Awakening" by the poet Aedon of his country, which was written to mourn his beloved son. His argument is that the death of our physical body is actually the awakening of the spirit. So, Er's closing his eyes today is probably the first time Er's spirit has awakened? Telling this to your mother comforted her greatly.

Alas, Rong'er! My pain over Er's death has already wasted thousands of words of ink, and I could have stopped here. But the above things must be made known to Er. This letter was written in late June, during my second visit to Zhenjiang to see your brother. I was constantly thinking of Er because of your brother, and I couldn't help but feel sad. In the lonely lamp of the guest house, I couldn't sleep at night, so I took out a pencil and wrote, stopping when my mind was exhausted. The next day, I finished it in the car, the tip of the pen was like drawing lotus silk, continuous and unbroken, unexpectedly exceeding two thousand words again. From now on, I will expect Er in my dreams, and I will no longer write letters to Er. I won't go on. Father's words to the close friends here. (Written on the hundredth day after Rong Jian's death)

Seasonal Fruit Column

### Ma Mountain Yangmei (Chinese Bayberry)

— Ousi

Maji Mountain (or called Ma Mountain) in Wujin County has high peaks and ridges, surrounded by lakes on all sides, and the scenery is extremely beautiful. Recently, it has been developed into a scenic area by the county government. Ma Mountain Yangmei: Saying it will not feel unfamiliar. Not only is it cheap, but also its taste is exceptionally beautiful. Those who taste it for the first time truly have the feeling of "not letting go even if slapped in the face." Now is also the time when the trees are full of red makeup.

In recent years, many Yangmei trees have died. Because everyone sees that there is not much harvest, they gradually stop paying attention to it, and it looks like it is disappearing, especially the white one, commonly known as "Crystal Plum," is even rarer. At the same time, there are also many difficulties in transportation; therefore, it is impossible to taste it in places a little further away, and even if there is, it is not very fresh and delicious.

### Li Mountain Drunken Plum

— Bō Guāng

Lijiaxiang in Changxing County, which belongs to the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, has quiet mountains and rivers, and the scenery is pleasant. There is a plain in the deep mountains and valleys, half of which is natural terrain, and half of which is built by artificial techniques. Houses are lined up one after another, and merchants converge, with tens of thousands of workers gathered and living there. It turns out to be a place of production of lime, stones, and stone powder. There are two stone mining companies, organized on a large scale.

Li Mountain in Lijiaxiang produces very famous Drunken Plums. The size of the Drunken Plum is a bit larger than a chicken egg, and the color is the same as a red rose. The plum skin is very thin. Tearing off some skin, you can put it on your lips and suck up the honey-sweet fruit juice, and there is a kind of fresh taste. It is a pity that the production is not much. People in Lijiaxiang specially pre-order from the producer and give them to the shareholders, bosses or relatives in Shanghai and Hangzhou. One yuan of legal tender can only buy eight. The shareholders and bosses in Shanghai and Hangzhou, after tasting the exotic flavor, entrust people in the company to pre-order every year, so they have priority.

A certain important person in Beijing heard of the famous Drunken Plum produced in this place, and turned to ask someone to taste the exotic flavor before giving it the elegant name "Amber Pearl." But I don't know what the intention is to name it Drunken Plum? Presumably its color is dark red, like a drunken face when people are drunk?

### Lintang Peach

— Fang Zheng

I haven't eaten Lintang peaches for many years. Now there is a possibility of re-tasting the old taste. Shouldn't I be happy that my appetite is not bad?

Lintang is a small village under the jurisdiction of Xiuning County, Anhui. The residents are good at planting, especially peaches. Where is the "Lintang Peach" famous? It turns out there are several advantages: 1. Sweet and crispy, 2. No worms, 3. Thin skin and small core, 4. Not many outer hairs. In short, the goodness of Lintang peaches is truly indescribable by my clumsy pen.

There are also many peach trees planted in our village, but the peaches that are produced are not as delicious as Lintang peaches, and they simply have a sour taste upon entering the mouth. For this reason, I once asked my cousin who lives in Lintang. According to him, when the peach tree grows to about the height of a person and has not yet bloomed, another kind of branch (such as plum, loquat, etc.) is wrapped with mud between the peach tree branches. The fruit that results will be sweet and delicious.

It is difficult to find traces of "Lintang Peach" in Shanghai, because it is too far away, and transportation is inconvenient, so it cannot supply the people of Shanghai like Baisha loquat. However, the waves of material civilization have already flown into our villages. Isn't the Beijing-Ganzhou Railway about to be completed? The virgin-like Lintang peach will surely be appreciated by the young masters of Shanghai. If this can be the case, it will be a small help to the residents of Lintang.

### Swapping the Nest, Bending the Phoenix

— Zhang Henshui

Chapter 14 (Wax Tears Pull Silk Curtains Bid Farewell to Good Dreams, Jade Face Moon Thins, Water Pavilion Mourns Remaining Glory)

Youmei said: I know you are in a bad mood. However, he, he, he shouldn't have. As Youmei spoke, she was pouring a cup of tea and bringing it to Menglan. She said it very casually. Menglan suddenly stood up, pressed the teacup with both hands, looked up at Youmei, and asked: Did he do something wrong? Youmei said: I saw a novel of his in a magazine. It wrote about a man who participated in the wedding ceremony of a confidant. At that time, a sharp knife was really cutting into his heart. However, at the banquet, he sang, played finger-guessing games, and toasted, seemingly extremely happy. So after returning home, he slept a great sleep with the help of wine, sleeping straight for three days before waking up. The story is very simple, but his description of the man's inner grief, while also being happy with people, that contradictory state of mind, was written really well. I, a person on the outside, couldn't help but shed two or three tears. While listening to him, Menglan's face changed, her eyes were fixed, and it seemed that tears were about to fall out. After he finished speaking, she immediately laughed, laughing as if very fiercely, throwing her head back and forth, messing up her hair. Then she took out a handkerchief to wipe her face, and rubbed her eyes twice, and smiled: You are also talking nonsense. A broad-minded person like you will listen to storytelling and cry, worrying about the ancients. And you have counted the tears yourself and there are only two or three, Youmei had already turned on the lights. Under the electric lights, they were not far apart from each other, and her eyes were already red, how could he not know? Her burst of laughter came too nonsensically and suddenly! Why like this, already understood in the heart. Because laughed: I am afraid that you will not be easy to digest after eating, especially lead you to laugh, is this not good? Menglan said: Okay, thank you very much for the kindness of my old friend. I have eaten and laughed, I should go. Saying, he flicked Youmei's hand and said: There are many things we want to say, but I have not said a word. You are my classmate for many years, and you know my temperament, so there is no need for me to say it. I know that I have let people down, but I have no choice. The moon is thin, there will be days to become round again, people are sick, old, can not go to find the lost youth again. I'm leaving, I can't help but say, excuse me for not expressing myself properly. Youmei knew that he was not speaking to himself, so he nodded a few times, and said in a low voice: I understand, if there is a chance, I will speak for you. Menglan said, what? Are you also waiting for an opportunity? Youmei also had Youmei's difficulties, how to talk to him well, just held his hand, shook it a few times only. (193)

### Occasional Notes of News

Benefit Oneself and Others

My residence is in the alley, this morning when I got up, I idly looked out the window, and accidentally saw two servants sweeping outside the door of the neighbor, and next to them was a housewife directing them, telling them to mix the Asian forest deodorant in the water and sprinkle it on the ground, and even sprinkled it at the door of her two neighbors. Her hygienic behavior is really able to benefit herself and others.

Curing Dampness

This kind of skin disease of "dampness" not only occurs on the feet, but can occur all over the body. A friend of mine named Wu had dampness on his neck, and a friend of mine named Xue had dampness on his hands. They both felt it was unsightly. After I introduced them to wash with "Asian Forest Sand," they both reported that they were cured, because my foot problem was also cured by washing with that kind of medicine.

### Shanghai and the Five Continents

— Weizai

Shanghai is not only a metropolis in the East, but also an important commercial port on the five continents.

Now is the period of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and all sectors are holding grand celebrations to show their joy and encourage the future. This is really meaningful.

I remember last year, Shanghai had a grand scene, that is, the Wuzhou Pharmacy held its 30th anniversary and the completion ceremony of the new building, which was sensational and near and far. This impression is still engraved in people's minds.

Wuzhou Pharmacy produces various good medicines, sanitary products, and soaps, with excellent results and sales at home and abroad, and Shanghai can be considered its important source.

I sincerely wish Shanghai and Wuzhou a future with unlimited brightness.
