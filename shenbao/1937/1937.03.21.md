### Last Words

[Guangzhou] Huang Musong's last words were: I have been studying and serving as an official for more than 40 years. I have no great learning or career to repay the country. I am deeply ashamed. Last year, I was ordered to preside over Guangdong. I was not capable of it, but because of the heavy trust placed in me by the central government and the earnest expectations of the elders, I dared not refuse to take on the task. I originally planned to fulfill my long-cherished ambitions and do something to make the unified Guangdong follow the right track and seek progress. Unfortunately, after returning to Guangdong for several months, I was troubled by illness in the middle. After a slight improvement, I was invaded by new illnesses, which became heavier day by day. According to my own estimation, I am afraid that I will not recover. It is a pity for me personally, but I am deeply burdened by the central government's trust and the earnest expectations of my elders and brothers in Guangdong, and I am uneasy. Fortunately, the whole country has been unified. Under the leadership of the wise leader Chairman Chiang, and with the care of Director Yu for the local area, I believe that the successor will be able to uphold this spirit and take on greater responsibilities for the benefit of Guangdong. Then I will have no regrets even in death. The gentlemen who are currently at my sickbed are all my dearest or have followed me for decades. Now, when I am about to die, I may as well briefly tell you about my life. The purpose I have always held is to restrain myself with integrity and encourage a clean life, and to seek progress with peace in dealing with things. Therefore, I have no great achievements in my life, nor any great mistakes. As far as the current political situation in our country is concerned, we should strive for practical unified production and construction as the only way out for saving the country. I returned to Guangdong this time with this in mind. My ambition was not fulfilled, and my life is over. What else can I say? I am of meager virtue and talent, and I am not worthy of being learned from, but I hope that you will encourage each other with this heart and this ambition, and serve the country. Then the day of my death will be the year of my life, and I will always be connected with you in spirit. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)

### Recent News on Bandit Suppression on the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border

Bandit Leader Fang Buzhou's Wife Captured, Anfu County Magistrate Dies in Bandit Suppression

Nanchang correspondence: Liu Xing, the director of bandit suppression in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border area, has long divided the bandit areas bordering western Jiangxi, northern Jiangxi, eastern Hunan, and southern Hubei into five major bandit suppression zones, each with a commander responsible for active suppression. The county magistrates also supervised local defense forces and the baojia system to handle the aftermath. According to reports from Pingxiang, ㊀ the first bandit suppression unit, Zhu's division, killed more than 30 bandits in Shuangkeng, and the remaining bandits fled to Huangjindong, bordering Xiuwu, Pingxiang, and Liuyang. ㊁ The political training sub-unit of the second bandit suppression zone has been effective in recruiting the pseudo-district committee of Xiu Shui County. ㊂ The third bandit suppression unit, Wu's division, engaged in a battle with Fang Buzhou, the bandit leader of the three-province border area, on the 2nd in a place 10 li north of Taipingtang, killing hundreds of bandits. Fang's wife was captured alive, and more than 80 bandits were captured, along with more than 100 guns. ㊃ The fourth bandit suppression zone has already defeated the pseudo-guerrilla battalion of Fenshuiba. At the same time, County Magistrate Yu of Tongshan cracked a bandit organization and obtained the pseudo-Northwest District's operational plan for February and March of the 26th year of the Republic, as well as other important documents. In all bandit areas bordering various counties, the political training sub-units and model guerrilla teams are using reformed elements to dismantle the lower-level organizations of the bandits and the secret organizations of the bandits in various places, cutting off their lifelines.

In addition, Zhu Mengzhen, the magistrate of Anfu County, recently led national troops to search for bandits in the countryside. Local bandits took advantage of the small number of local defense force troops and surrounded them on all sides. County Magistrate Zhu led his troops in a desperate battle, but was outnumbered and died a heroic death. After receiving the news, the provincial government expressed great sorrow and has appointed Cao to be the county magistrate to handle the aftermath.

### De Wang's Ambition ㊀

— By Our Reporter Qian Hua

Wants to Use Foreign Force to Become Genghis Khan, A Mongolian Scholar with Genius

The former Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee was located in Bailingmiao. The office was a very large Mongolian yurt, lavishly decorated inside. It could accommodate more than 200 people for major conferences each year and was divided into many small rooms. The conference hall was carpeted with thick rugs and equipped with new-style stoves, no different from Western-style buildings. Many Mongolian princes and dukes frequented the place, and Secretary-General De Wang was even more of a regular visitor. Bailingmiao has always been a religious area and a major trading center for Mongolians and Han Chinese. Since the establishment of the Mongolian Political Council, it has become the political center of Inner Mongolia. With the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, it has also become the base of operations for bandit and puppet troops. Its strategic importance has truly increased day by day.

In the past, any Chinese and foreign travelers or other groups who visited Bailingmiao would definitely pay a visit to De Wang, the new-style leader of Inner Mongolia and Secretary-General of the Mongolian Political Council. The impression they got was unanimously good. Now, this De Wang is a puppet leader issuing orders for the bandit and puppet troops, and the puppeteer behind the scenes is the certain party pointed to by the world. Based on that consistent Manchu-Mongolian policy, the certain party shouted the slogan that Inner Mongolia is the first line of defense for the empire, and after decades of operation and arrangement, incited and provoked, causing internal division and collapse, in order to reap the benefits of a fisherman. This is also a matter of course and nothing to be surprised about. But why is the intelligent De Wang willing to be manipulated and used by a certain party? This is indeed a question worth studying, and it is also a key to solving the Inner Mongolia problem. The so-called know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle. When I was in Bailingmiao, I investigated this matter and interviewed many people who used to be close to De Wang. I also collected a lot of materials in Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and Beiping. Now I summarize it as follows.

㊀ Does Not Understand Japanese

De Wang's full name is Demchugdongrub, and he is 36 years old. He was born in Sunit Right Banner (also known as West Sunit Banner) in Xilingol League, Chahar. It was not until the 34th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty that he inherited the title of Zasag Prince of Sunit Right Banner. When he was stationed in Zhangjiakou in the first year of the Republic of China, he was given the title of Prince. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he officially took over the Zasag Seal. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Duan Qirui convened a post-war conference in Beiping, and De Wang represented the three leagues of Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Ih Ju and attended the conference. He was appointed as a Senator of the Provisional Senate. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, he was promoted to Deputy League Leader of Xilingol League. In the nineteenth year, he served as a member of the Chahar Provincial Government. In the twenty-second year, the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee was established, and he served as a member and Secretary-General. In the twenty-third year, the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee of various leagues and banners in Chahar Province was established, and he served as chairman. De Wang studied at the Mongolian-Tibetan School in Suiyuan and Beiping in his early years, and had a solid foundation in Chinese. He spoke fluent Beiping dialect. Later, he hired an American teacher in his palace to study English and the political, economic, and military knowledge of European and American countries, and he was quite clear about the general international situation.

His English level was barely enough to deal with British and American people, but he was very hardworking, subscribing to many Chinese and foreign newspapers and concerned about the evolution of world affairs. Among many Mongolian princes and dukes, his thinking and knowledge were indeed the most novel. Because of the relationship between the bandit and puppet troops and a certain party this time, many people say that he is a Japanese student. In fact, he doesn't speak Japanese at all. Recently, many Japanese soldiers came to the palace to visit him, and they were all translated by Major General Nagashima, the head of the special service agency. From the perspective of his personal historical process, he is more inclined towards Europe and the United States. His footprints have never set foot on the islands of Japan except for the three northeastern provinces and northern China. His dealings with the Japanese have only been in recent years. It is too imaginative to say that he is a Japanese student who speaks Japanese. (To be continued)

### Fundamental Problems of China's Economic Construction

— Lian Shisheng

The reason why England has dominated the world for three hundred years is because she is an advanced industrial country. The reason why the United States and Japan have dominated the East and West Oceans after the war is because their productivity has made amazing progress. The reason why the Soviet Union has been so influential in recent years is because her two five-year plans have been successfully completed one after another. Living in today's highly competitive world, a country without active economic construction as a backing cannot only fail to make the masses live and work in peace and contentment, but also cannot resist foreign aggression and seek survival. Therefore, our current task must be to urge the government to formulate a rationalized economic construction plan on the one hand, and to encourage the masses to embrace the determination to work hard and implement the plan on the other hand, so that we can overcome difficulties and achieve the goal of rejuvenation.

In fact, the government has long known the importance of China's economic construction, and has been consciously undertaking some work in recent years - the most obvious is the repair of roads. These achievements are indeed commendable, but from the perspective of economic construction itself, we still have many things that need to be supplemented urgently. I believe that if China's economic construction is to succeed in the near future, we must awaken the public's attention: to awaken the public's attention, there must first be practical achievements; to have practical achievements, we must start with the following fundamental problems.

What are these fundamental problems?

First, capital must be concentrated. The trend of modern industry is large-scale production, and large-scale production is based on large-scale organization. However, this production method and organization method can only be hoped to succeed in large companies and state-owned enterprises with strong capital, and the meager abilities of a few people are really out of the question. The benefits of large-scale production are: producers can obtain cheap raw materials, reduce unnecessary handling fees and office expenses, and make full use of the capabilities of factories and workers. As a result, costs are reduced, prices are lower, and markets can be monopolized everywhere. The reason why the modern Japanese cotton industry was able to defeat the British is mainly because it merged many cotton factories across the country into 71 companies, increasing the total capital to more than 500 million yen. Among them, the paid-up capital of companies such as the Toyo Cotton Company is as high as 55 million yen. With such strong capital, factory owners have the ability to build the most suitable factories, hire the most capable experts, and equip the most modern machines, which also helps them to be well-informed and efficient, and of course, manipulating the market is as easy as flipping their hand.

In principle, I believe that no one would object to concentrating capital. However, China is a poor country. Where can we get so much capital for the government to carry out economic construction step by step? I think that in addition to the method of public sales of matches and cigarettes mentioned by Mr. Chen Gongbo in his four-year industrial plan, two other methods can be adopted for the preparation of capital. One method is to reduce expenditure. There are really too many agencies in the central government now. Some things that can be handled by one agency are handled by several agencies separately, resulting in many increased expenses. Just in terms of economic construction, it is enough for the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways to jointly handle this matter, but in recent years, in addition to establishing an Economic Commission, we have also established the National Economic Movement Committee, the National Economic Planning Committee, and other agencies. With more agencies, expenditures will naturally increase, and the laxity of organization is even more of a concern. If the central government can merge these agencies into a National Economic Construction Committee, it can save a large expense every year. Also, most of China's military expenditure is used for food and salaries, and military equipment is not given much attention. These soldiers who are not enough to resist the enemy and are more than enough to cause trouble should be largely eliminated, and the expenditure on food and salaries should be saved to purchase munitions and supplement economic construction funds. Another method is to use foreign capital. After 1923, Japan's economic construction was maintained by loans from Britain and the United States. When the Soviet Union's first five-year plan was just implemented in 1928, it also had the help of foreign talents. Now that the central government intends to engage in construction, it may as well sincerely propose methods and conditions for cooperation to our true allies. If this road is successful, we don't have to worry about the source of our capital.

Second, we must adapt to the times. The lack of capital is a major obstacle to China's economic construction, so we must base our allocation of funds on reliable statistical surveys, and then plan which undertakings to handle first, which to handle later, which to handle more, and which to handle less. Otherwise, if the pace is disrupted and the measures are inappropriate, we will not see the achievements of construction, and our limited capital will have been used up. It will be ten times more difficult to raise capital and start over in the future than it is today. I believe that China's current economic construction must strictly adhere to the principle of regional division of labor. The central government should coordinate the overall situation, issue instructions, and the local governments should make full use of the most abundant special products and specialize in developing one or two industries, such as rice in the Yangtze River Basin, cotton in North China, leather goods in the Northwest, aquatic products in the coastal provinces, silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, porcelain in Jiangxi, medicinal materials in Yunnan and Sichuan, lacquer in Fujian, and fruits and plants in Guangdong. If we guide them according to their strengths, the results will definitely be more impressive than learning from Handan and abandoning ourselves to follow others. In recent years, those who talk about economic construction in the country mostly focus on developing transportation and heavy industry. These are certainly important, but in reality, the cost of heavy industry is too high, and we are really unable to do it for the time being. At the same time, transportation is just a tool. The most important thing is that we need to produce more things to use this tool. Otherwise, if our productivity is always lagging behind, then the development of transportation tools will only increase the convenience of smuggling for the enemy. Why bother to spend so much effort to serve the enemy exclusively.

Third, we must be practical and not superficial. The common fault of most people is that they love to show off and are not practical, and people engaged in economic construction are no exception. People say to prosper cities, and we also want to prosper cities, and the way to prosper is not to spend tens of millions of dollars to build dozens of tall Western-style buildings to serve as a façade, but to spend millions of dollars to repair antiques to decorate a scene of prosperity. Officials enjoy themselves, managers embezzle, and the masses not only cannot taste a bit of the taste of construction, but also increase countless burdens out of thin air because of construction. It is difficult for such construction to gain the sympathy of the masses. I think that the fundamental problem of China's economic construction is not the lack of plans, but too many plans; not the inability to start, but the inability to persist. No matter who comes to power, they will come up with a grandiose plan. Once there is a plan, they will not ask whether the economic source is reliable, whether a certain undertaking can be successfully carried out, and they will rush to carry it out, and even only have plans and agencies, and are not willing to seriously undertake one or two undertakings. The way to remedy this in the future must be to make rationalized plans based on possible economic sources. After the plans have been reviewed and announced, they must be implemented with all efforts, and it is best to be able to implement them successfully within the scheduled period, just like the Soviet Union's five-year plan being completed in four years. In the event that the incumbent official is relieved of his duties for some reason, the successor must be good at understanding the will of the predecessors, prioritize the future of the country, not lightly change the plan, not set up too many agencies, and not casually advance or retreat personnel, with the overall goal of completing the unfinished plan in a timely manner so that it will not be abandoned halfway. Only in this way can we get practical results, awaken the public's attention, and gain the public's support.

Now the call for economic construction has spread throughout the country. I sincerely hope that those who are directly responsible can prepare sufficient capital, develop the existing industries in the locality, be less ostentatious, work more, and if we do this for ten years, China will definitely have hope of rejuvenation. At that time, all the great disasters of the country can be solved easily.

### Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Declares to the House of Representatives That He Will Immediately Commence Concrete Negotiations with Various Countries

His Previous Speech Was Merely a Supplement and Not a Correction; His Determination in Handling Affairs Hereafter Will Be No Less Than That of the Military

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee deliberating on the supplementary budget proposal for the twelfth year convened at 10:30 AM. Seiyukai member Masayoshi Motomura requested Navy Minister Yonai to provide a detailed explanation, without recording, of the Japanese Navy's attitude towards the Chengdu and Beihai incidents. Subsequently, Minseito member Tetsuo Kudo questioned Foreign Minister Sato's new diplomatic policy, which the public is closely watching. He noted that the opinions expressed by Sato in both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives have been repeatedly corrected, which may cause confusion. He asked why it was necessary to supplement the opinions expressed in the House of Representatives in the House of Peers, and requested an explanation.

Foreign Minister Sato replied that there was no need to correct his speeches in either House, and that he did not believe there was anything that needed correcting. However, the meaning of "supplement" was not to overturn previous statements. He offered the same explanation in the House of Peers. He stated that he will immediately commence concrete negotiations with various countries and hopes that preparatory steps will facilitate progress.

Kudo asked that, in this era of expanding military strength, the Foreign Minister should exert utmost calm and recruit talent from all sectors into the diplomatic arena to rejuvenate diplomacy. He asked if Sato had such determination.

The Foreign Minister replied that he believed all previous foreign ministers had such determination. In today's critical situation, this determination is even more necessary, needless to say. The current cabinet should be in complete agreement with diplomacy, and the military should be integrated with it, mutually supporting each other, which goes without saying. The military stationed abroad handles affairs with extraordinary determination, and this enthusiastic spirit is truly admirable. He feels that he must also handle affairs with a determination no less than that of the military, especially in light of the development of Japanese commercial rights. He keenly feels the necessity of such determination. Although his strength is limited, he will pay full attention to the reform of institutions and the recruitment of talent, and will strive to promote suitable individuals.

Prime Minister Hayashi replied that he is currently studying the reform of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and personnel matters with great enthusiasm.

Next, Seiyukai member Saburo Yatsukado asked whether the Foreign Minister believes today's Japanese budget is expanding military strength, and asked for an explanation of the "crisis" language used since the Manchurian Incident. He also asked whether "patience" should be exercised even when both sides refuse to concede, and whether there is an intention to create an exclusionary group when the time is right. He asked the Foreign Minister about the fundamental principles of diplomatic policy. The Foreign Minister replied that he only addressed the question of determination in response to Kudo's question. Regarding the diplomatic crisis, it can be understood by reading the records of the time. The so-called "patience" is based on international justice, and there is no need to despair if negotiations stall. If the other party adopts an attitude that violates international justice, they should be responsible. As for the so-called exclusionary group, he believes it is not yet the time. The fundamental principles of diplomatic policy were decided before he took office, and he will formulate policies accordingly.

Yatsukado reiterated his request for an explanation. The Foreign Minister replied that he also feels that strengthening national defense is extremely necessary. Today's national defense budget is the minimum necessary to strengthen national defense and should not provoke other countries.

Tadahiko Ikezaki asked about the Foreign Minister's statement in the House of Representatives Red Ink Committee that extreme nationalistic thought leads to narrow-minded patriotism. He asked what this meant and whether the principle of economic reciprocity contradicts the fundamental principles towards China.

The Foreign Minister replied that his remarks about nationalistic thought were originally directed at the words and attitudes of foreign residents in Japan. He added that the principle of reciprocity is a basic element of diplomatic policy towards China.

Yoshinuma Yutani of the Toho-kai asked about the Foreign Minister's speeches and their potential impact on foreign countries.

The Foreign Minister replied that it should not have a negative impact on foreign countries in general.

Yutani asked that, for example, Chinese media organs are taking an aggressive attitude toward Japan, in his opinion. The Foreign Minister stated that he believes improving international public opinion is a fundamental task to be undertaken before engaging in various negotiations, with the aim of harmonizing the feelings of the other party.

There was a recess at 1:15 PM, and the meeting reconvened at 2:25 PM. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM. (Twentieth-day Allied Press dispatch)

### The Situation of Japanese Nationals Selling Narcotics in Our Country

British Newspaper Publishes Commentary

[London] The Manchester Guardian recently published an article on the Chinese narcotics problem, stating in brief: "The center of opium and its derivatives production is currently in Shenyang and other Manchurian cities, eastern Hebei, and the Japanese concessions in Tianjin. All kinds of narcotics are sold in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, and the prices are low and the supply is extremely convenient. Although Chinese authorities strictly prohibit opium within their own jurisdiction and even punish drug traffickers with death, it is impossible to prohibit this within the areas under Japanese influence. Moreover, Japanese merchants who sell and smuggle drugs travel throughout China, even in provinces currently governed by the Nanjing government. It is alarming that poor Chinese people, regardless of age, are tempted, knowingly or unknowingly, and often become addicted to drugs." (Twentieth-day Central News Agency dispatch from Le Havre)

### Japan to Establish Aircraft Manufacturing Company

Capital of 30 Million Yuan

[Tokyo] Japan's massive military budget, totaling 1.4 billion yuan, includes 300 million yuan for the development of the army, navy, and air force. The Ministry of Communications has also allocated over 10 million yuan to promote civil aviation. Therefore, a large aircraft manufacturing company will soon be established here. Aircraft manufacturing is the most important sector of Japan's military industry, and until now has been controlled by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Nakajima Aircraft Factory. However, according to information received today, Japan's largest aircraft company is being founded by Tamaki Makino, Jukuro Kadono, Masatsune Ogura, and Toranosuke Furukawa, centered around Mitsui, Sumitomo, Furukawa, and Okura, to compete with the two companies mentioned above. The new company's capital is expected to be 30 million yuan, and the factory will be located in the suburbs of Tokyo. Japan's aircraft manufacturing industry lags behind the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union in terms of technology and production capacity (it is expected that there will be considerable progress in the future).

### Quezon to Hold Initial Negotiations with US Authorities

Discussion of Committee Procedures; President of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce Supports Quezon

[Washington] Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles announced today that the US-Philippines Joint Committee will be formed within ten days, and then begin studying revisions to the Philippine Independence Act. US commissioners will be selected by committees from various departments, while the Philippine side will be appointed by President Quezon. As for the procedures, Quezon will continue discussions with US State Department officials. Both the US and Philippine Congresses will take action after the committee submits its report, but are also free to take action earlier. It is understood that responsible members of Congress have indicated a willingness to follow President Roosevelt's recommendations. (Nineteenth-day National News Agency dispatch)

[New York] Philippine President Quezon declared here today that the US government committees have not yet accepted his suggestion to grant the Philippines independence before 1946. However, it has clearly indicated that it will be open to discussion once the special committee has submitted its report. A professor at the Columbia University School of Journalism hosted a banquet for President Quezon today. During the banquet, Quezon spoke about the reasons why Filipinos are demanding independence, and spoke to student groups about the Philippine Constitution, saying that it is based on the US Constitution, but was drafted by enlightened people who understood current changes, and is therefore superior to the original. The Philippine Constitution contains the life philosophy of the Philippine people's collective life. He stated that what the US President is now advocating for are judicial reform and limiting the power of Congress to decide on budgetary matters, which the Philippine Constitution has already taken into account. Although the United States is rich, it is still insufficient; although the Philippines is poor, it has a surplus. Quezon will stay here this weekend and is scheduled to return to Washington next Monday to discuss the selection of special committee members with Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles. US High Commissioner to the Philippines Paul McNutt will visit Quezon in Washington, and Quezon will reciprocate the following day. (Nineteenth-day National News Agency dispatch)

[Manila] President Aquinado of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce telegraphed US President Roosevelt today, supporting Philippine President Quezon's suggestion for early Philippine independence. He requested that President Roosevelt take action in Congress as soon as possible to achieve immediate Philippine independence. Aquinado is also the leader of the Philippine minority party.

### A Brief History of Naval Negotiations After the War

French Publish Report

[Paris] The Naval Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has recently published a report outlining a brief history of naval negotiations since the Great War, and commenting on the new naval situation resulting from last year's London Naval Treaty (concluded by the UK, France, and the US). It states that "the Washington Naval Treaty only recognized the UK, the US, and Japan as major naval powers, dividing naval control among them, and completely ignored France's need to protect its colonies. Last year's London Naval Treaty finally recognized France's need, and since then, the autocratic ranking system in the naval field has ceased to exist. The provision that each signatory must notify each other of naval shipbuilding procedures has greatly facilitated the cause of spiritual disarmament. All of this is the greatest achievement of last year's London Naval Treaty." The report also states that last year's London Naval Treaty demonstrates the rapprochement between the three major democracies of the UK, France, and the US, but it is regrettable that Japan and Italy have not yet signed on to the treaty.

Over 400 Bodies Recovered; Cause Determined to Be Gas Explosion

⊙Austin Gas explosion expert Dr. Askey is currently investigating the New London school explosion tragedy. According to the investigation, the school walls were full of gas, and the tragedy was caused by a gas explosion. After carefully examining the six gas radiators that remained intact after the explosion, he discovered that only one had a good ventilation hole. The bodies of the deceased children show that they were killed by the explosion, not by fire. (Twentieth-day Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency)

⊙New London After searching the elementary school building that was tragically destroyed on Wednesday, a total of 425 teachers and students' bodies have been found. The death toll is estimated at about 620. A six-member investigation team has begun to investigate to determine the cause of the explosion. According to initial reports, the tragedy was caused by the accumulation of gas in the boiler room. The investigation team will now summon witnesses and survivors to testify. At the same time, the Washington Mining Department has sent four experts to investigate, and the Texas State House of Representatives has passed a proposal to investigate the matter. As workers cleared the rubble, they found a blackboard with the words "East Texas' oil and natural gas are the greatest mineral welfare.

⊙New London Yesterday's unprecedented tragedy at the elementary school due to a boiler explosion has resulted in the excavation of the remains of the victims in the wreckage of the school, which was finally completed this afternoon. According to a report from Colonel Burke, the commander of the militia assisting in the excavation, a total of 425 bodies have been recovered, including 17 confirmed teacher bodies, most of whom have severed limbs and are too horrible to look at. However, it is possible that other bodies will be discovered later. According to the authorities, there are more than 40 teachers and more than 700 students in the school, indicating that more than half of the victims are dead. Texas Governor Allred has mobilized the militia to rush to the scene of the accident to provide relief. The American Red Cross has also been ordered by President Roosevelt to immediately send personnel to rescue. All oil mines in the town stopped working during the accident, and the rain today added to the misery. Many parents of students, unable to find their children, are unwilling to leave the scene of the accident. Nearby hospitals, schools, and churches are full of injured and corpses, many of which have not yet been identified. Yesterday's water explosion occurred at 2:20 PM, only a few minutes before the students were dismissed. As for the cause of the explosion, the reports vary. The Texas State Assembly has passed a resolution calling for an investigation to clarify the truth. (Nineteenth-day Central News Agency dispatch from Le Havre)

This tragedy is different from the war, but it is enough to make those who see it sad and those who hear it grieve, even more so. (Twentieth-day Central News Agency dispatch from Le Havre)

### Hull Delivers Speech: US Concerned About Welfare of the Far East

Neutrality Not a Barrier to Avoid War; Europe Unlikely to Avoid Looting if It Does Not Disarm

[Washington] The House Ways and Means Committee today released a recent letter from Secretary of State Hull, containing a warning that if European countries do not rein in their plans to expand armaments, they will inevitably invite military and economic looting. If European countries gradually eliminate trade barriers, the stability of exchange rates and the cessation of armaments can be easily resolved. The letter states that the situation in the Far East has not been stable throughout the year, and the protection of American citizens in China has been a constant concern for the State Department, sometimes causing serious concern. The US government is concerned about the lives and property of American citizens, as well as the peace and welfare of the countries in the Far East, causing it to pay close attention to any developments in that region. The House Ways and Means Committee today passed the regular expenses of the State Department, the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Labor, totaling $121,223,000. (Nineteenth-day National News Agency dispatch)

[Washington] The House Appropriations Committee met today, and Secretary of State Hull elaborated on the issue of neutrality, stating in brief: "When war breaks out in the future, the United States cannot use its neutrality policy as a shield. The policy we pursue to protect the rights of neutral countries has the danger of dragging our country into the vortex of war. This danger must be eliminated with great effort, but this does not mean abandoning all the rights of neutral countries. If we do this, the belligerent countries will treat us as servants. What the American people should keep in mind is that the neutrality law is not a reliable guarantee that our country will never be involved in the vortex of war." Hull also addressed the world economic problem, stating in brief that the trend of developing international trade is becoming increasingly clear. "Otherwise, the great economic disasters that may occur cannot be avoided." Finally, Hull advocated for the establishment of commercial treaties with various countries based on the principle of reciprocity, as only then can we discuss other issues with various countries, such as the issue of arms "truce." (Nineteenth-day Central News Agency dispatch from Le Havre)

[Washington] Regarding President Roosevelt's plan to convene a world economic conference in the near future, with a capital city of a Scandinavian country as the venue, Secretary of State Hull revealed the news at the House Appropriations Committee today, saying that he had earnestly advised the authorities of a certain European country to take action in reference to the Pan-American Peace Conference, and told them, "The economic situation is so unsound, and the political situation is so extremely chaotic, how can you be content with sighs and lamentations? Why not think of what the Pan-American Peace Conference is doing?" Responsible people here believe that since President Roosevelt has spoken of convening a world economic conference, and Hull has issued such a declaration, they are paying extreme attention to it.

### Taiwanese Arrested in Zhangzhou for Smuggling Arms

Smuggling Arms Is Actually Sheltered by the Baozhang; Cai, Zeng, and Qiu Have All Been Captured

Xiamen Correspondence: Guo Tianfeng, a platoon leader of the 157th Division stationed in Songyu, Haicheng County, across from Xiamen, was ordered to lead a team together with District Chief Lin Xiaomu to Zhongshanwei Township at 2:00 a.m. on the 12th to surround and search the residence of Baozhang Cai Jun. Cai Jun, Zeng Hongxi, and Qiu Jian were captured and sent to the Zhangzhou Division Headquarters for investigation on the same day. It is reported that Zeng Hongxi and Qiu Jian usually travel between Taiwan, Xiamen, and the coastal areas, specializing in smuggling arms and private goods. Their influence extends throughout the coastal areas of southern Fujian. Last month, a large batch of private goods was transported to Kinmen and seized by the county's security team. The remaining accomplices fled to Hui'an County and smuggled 10,000 taels of opium into Zhangzhou, all related to Zeng Hongxi. This time, Zeng and Qiu were arrested because they secretly transported hundreds of long and short guns from Taiwan last month and unloaded them in Xin'an Village, hiding them at the home of villager Qiu Lian, who then transported them inland. Baozhang Cai Jun actually provided shelter, which was discovered by the division headquarters. Therefore, Cai, Zeng, and Qiu were arrested and investigated on suspicion of smuggling arms. After this incident, Zeng's mother, Zeng Wang, published a notice in the newspaper stating that her son was a legitimate businessman from Xiamen who went to Zhongshanwei Village to ask Cai Jun to help purchase brown sugar for sale in Xiamen. He was falsely accused and had no involvement in smuggling arms. She had already submitted a plea to the Zhangzhou Division Headquarters. As of the 15th, the Japanese newspaper in this city acknowledged that Zeng Hongxi was Taiwanese who traveled between Xiamen and Haicheng to sell groceries and purchase local sugar, but was detained due to malicious false accusations. This case is currently under investigation by the Zhangzhou Division Headquarters. According to reports, a large number of Taiwanese have privately entered the mainland in recent years, especially in Quanzhou. A recent investigation shows that there are also hundreds of people in Zhangzhou, but the reported ancestral homes are all counties in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. In fact, the ancestors of Taiwanese people originally migrated from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. Taiwan was only transferred to Japan 40 years ago. Those who return to Zhangzhou and Quanzhou naturally have their ancestral homes, relatives, and clans there. It is extremely difficult to identify them unless they admit to being Taiwanese. However, whenever there is a criminal incident, their status as residents is revealed. For example, when Zeng Hongxi committed a crime, he immediately claimed to be Taiwanese. (March 17th)

### Yu Xuezhong's Troops Fully Enter Northern Anhui

Transportation Trains Are Fully Arranged; Depart from Xi'an and Xianyang; Housing Demand in Bengbu Exceeds Supply

Bengbu Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong's troops are moving to Anhui and have been gradually moving eastward from Gansu. They will be concentrated in Xianyang for train transport. The railway transport plan for the Gansu Pacification Commissioner's Office and its subordinate units has been formulated. The number of trains required by each unit, the start date of transport, the route, the train commander, and the disembarkation location have also been fully arranged, compiled into a table, and submitted to each unit for reference. It is learned that starting from the 26th of this month, transport will be carried out separately from Xi'an and Xianyang, passing through the Longhai and Jinpu railways, and disembarking in Bengbu. A total of one hundred and five trains are expected, and the transport will not be completed until approximately April 20th. As for the location of the Pacification Commissioner's Office and its various departments, Camp Commander Liu Zhenhe has been responsible for surveying and determining the location. It is reported that the entire staff of the Commissioner's Office, estimated at over a thousand people, and most of the officers in various departments are bringing their families. Public housing surveys and private housing rentals have been conducted for days, with demand exceeding supply, resulting in a shortage of housing throughout the city. As a result, housing prices have soared, which has never happened before. Once a large army gathers, the market can be expected to prosper. The residence of Yu Xuezhong and his family has been rented at Tangyuan. In addition, part of Zhang Xueliang's family has also moved to Bengbu. Yu will come to Bengbu to deploy everything. The local community here is preparing to welcome him at that time. (19th)

### Jiangsu High Court Hears Case of Foreigner Donating Property to Chinese Government

The Witness Is Former Acting Minister to Italy, Jiang Fanwu; Liu Wendao, Former Minister to Italy, Investigated the Case and Requested Inquiry

Suzhou Correspondence: The Jiangsu High Court recently received a case from the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee for trial. The case involves Jiang Fanwu, a native of Suzhou and former acting Chinese Minister to Italy, accepting a property donated to the Chinese government by a foreigner, Bass. Bass, a German Jew residing in Italy, had always admired Eastern culture. He passed away six years ago, leaving an estate worth approximately 800,000 Chinese yuan, which he bequeathed to the Chinese government for the purpose of promoting Eastern culture. When Acting Minister Jiang in Italy received a notice from the Italian authorities, he decided that whether the Chinese government was willing to accept this estate should be consulted first. Therefore, he telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At that time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs was Luo Wengan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to Acting Minister Jiang's request at first. At this time, Bass's family suddenly raised objections to Bass's will, claiming that the estate should be inherited by the family. They filed a property lawsuit with the Italian judiciary, naming the Chinese government as the defendant. Acting Minister Jiang in Italy then telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again, requesting further instructions. At the same time, he hired an Italian lawyer to deal with the lawsuit. Subsequently, the case was adjudicated, and Bass's estate was to be accepted by the Chinese government. The plaintiff, Bass's family, was ordered to issue a written apology to the Chinese government. After Acting Minister Jiang received the verdict, he received a reply from Foreign Minister Luo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Chinese government was unwilling to compete with foreigners for property and therefore did not want to accept the estate. After receiving the reply, Acting Minister Jiang said that according to Italian law, anyone unwilling to inherit property must declare it to the local Italian authorities within six months. When the Ministry's reply arrived at the Chinese embassy in Italy, the above-mentioned statutory period had already expired. Moreover, since the estate had already been adjudicated to be accepted by the Chinese government, Bass's funeral should be taken care of as an example, and the litigation costs, including the hiring of lawyers, totaled 160,000 yuan. Therefore, a portion was withdrawn from Bass's estate to pay for it. However, regarding the Ministry's reply, there were practical difficulties, so he hesitated. As a result, except for the 160,000 yuan used to cover the above-mentioned expenses, the rest was not touched. The matter came to an end here. Until the year before last, Liu Wendao was ordered to Italy as Minister. After taking office, he reviewed the case files and found that in addition to the Ministry's reply, there were no documents in the case file that could be used for reference. Liu learned about the process and believed that Acting Minister Jiang had disobeyed government orders. He reported the details to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then sent the case to the Control Yuan for review. The Control Yuan decided to transfer the case to the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee for deliberation. Now, the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee has decided to send the case to the Jiangsu High Court for trial. All the case files have been sent to the Jiangsu High Court, and the High Court is investigating the case and will schedule a hearing.

### Wuxi Public Organizations Oppose Collection of Land Value Tax

Committee Designated to Study Land Value Tax; Telegraph to Officials Requesting Temporary Suspension

Wuxi Correspondence: The local government has begun to levy land value tax. Previously, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau sent Ma Yulin to Wuxi as a land value estimator to conduct preliminary estimates. Recently, the Wuxi Native Place Association in Shanghai believed that once the land value tax is levied, the tax rate will be too high to bear. Out of concern for their hometown, they telegraphed the County Chamber of Commerce the other day, asking them to pay attention. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce convened the County Party Department, various public legal organizations, and local people at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 20th) to discuss the matter publicly. More than 100 people attended. Tang Yifang from the County Government and Yan Baozi from the Land Administration Bureau attended as observers. Qian Sunqing, Li Tiping, and Zhang Jichang were publicly elected as the presidium. Qian Sunqing first reported the purpose of the meeting. After deliberation by the public, it was decided: ㊀ In accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions, the collection of taxes should be temporarily suspended before autonomy is completed. A report should be submitted to the province requesting consideration and indicating when the collection will begin. Sun Xixia, Xu Yiting, Zhang Jichang, Li Tiping, Qian Sunqing, and others were appointed to draft the report, which will be jointly discussed on the 22nd. ㊁ Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions regarding the Land Law and Provisional Measures will be compiled into a booklet. Qian Sunqing, Li Tiping, Chen Zhanru, Zhang Jichang, Sun Xixia, Xu Yiting, Cao Hengzhi, Gao Jianxi, Huang Huiru, Hua Chun'an, Tang Lisheng, and others were appointed as members of the Land Value Tax Research Committee, with Li Tiping responsible for convening meetings. The liaison office will be located at the Lawyers' Association. Finally, the Jiangsu Provincial City Land Value Declaration Measures and the issue of the Land Administration Bureau's collection of interest income were discussed. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. It was decided that the interest income already collected by the Land Administration Bureau should be reported by the County Property Office to the county for verification and return. The collection of uncollected interest should be suspended. The meeting concluded at around 6:00 p.m. After the meeting, the five drafting committee members drafted a telegram to the central and provincial authorities requesting a suspension.

### Ministry of Finance Increases Salt Tax in Beijing

Salt Industry Groups Petition to Stop the Tax

Beijing News: After the opening of Beijing's salt market and the permission of free trade since the year before last, the tax rate was 7 yuan and 1 jiao per dan, which was originally balanced with the tax rates of nearby franchised areas. However, recently, at the request of nearby franchised merchants, the financial authorities actually increased the Beijing salt tax by 6 jiao, 6 fen, and 5 li per dan, nominally called a public welfare donation. Various salt industry groups believe that the increase in Beijing's salt tax not only violates the previous opening purpose, but also contradicts the central government's repeated orders to abolish exorbitant taxes. On the afternoon of the 19th, they went to the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Administration to meet with Minister Kong and Director Zhu to petition for the cessation of the tax. The Ministry of Finance specially sent Secretary Zhang Shiyun and the Salt Affairs Administration sent Section Chief Zhang Tonggao to receive them. Both agreed to convey the original intention of the petition to stop the public welfare donation for verification. According to the representatives of the petition, this public welfare donation for salt has not gone through the national legislative process, and the people have no obligation to bear it. The current Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage already has clear provisions. They hope that the authorities will stop the tax immediately. If the goal is not achieved, they will petition the municipal government and party headquarters. (Continental News Agency)

Nervous Breakdown After Failing to Win Lottery

At the end of last month, Xi went to Shanghai for business and bought a strip of lottery tickets with different numbers. The sales clerk strongly advised him to buy another strip. Xi initially agreed and copied the numbers into his diary. However, after buying the tickets, he hesitated and returned the strip with the number 173879.

The money was then divided equally among the five workers. The first person to discover it received 800 yuan, and the others received 400 yuan each.

### Wujiang

Doctor Bribed, Sent to Court

Cai Baojun, a doctor at the county hospital in this county, accepted a bribe from Gu Dai. He was exposed in court by Song Gengsheng. Section Chief Zhang of the county government immediately arrested Song Gengsheng and released Cai Baojun on bail for investigation. The other day, County Magistrate Xu returned to the county and paid special attention to the case. He personally interrogated Song Gengsheng and Doctor Cai. Because the case was significant, it has been transferred to the Suzhou High Court for legal action.

### Danyang

Dragon Bones Discovered in Bailong Mountain

In the northeast township of this county, there is a Bailong Temple, which enshrines the Dragon God. There is a mountain in front of the temple that produces a lot of stone. The scholars have always relied on quarrying stone to burn lime as their livelihood. The other day, while the stone workers were quarrying, a small cave was suddenly discovered in the mountain, with a stream of green smoke emerging from it. The stone workers were greatly surprised. Looking into the cave, there were two very long dragon-shaped remains, complete with heads and horns, causing a sensation far and wide. The villagers carried hoes and shovels to dig up the dragon bones, amounting to about two stones. The heads and horns were scattered. The incident was learned by the Nanjing Central Geological Research Institute, which sent personnel to Danyang to collect them. County Magistrate Jiang specially ordered the deputy captain of the security team to accompany them to the township to collect multiple pieces of dragon bone for research in Beijing.

### Yangzhou

Provincial Commissioner Comes to Clear Old Taxes

The Jiangsu Department of Finance recently sent Li Bingsong to Yangzhou to clear land taxes. However, County Magistrate Ma believes that the county is currently collecting new grain taxes, and it is difficult to proceed at the same time. He specially discussed the matter with the official and agreed on a method to wait until the committee has completed the review of each year's outstanding taxes and know the exact number of civilian debts and official debts before starting the clearance, which will be easier to handle. Yesterday (the 19th), it was jointly reported to the department for verification.

### Nantong

Training for All District Baozhangs

There are more than 8,400 Baozhangs in the district under Nantong. The special commissioner's office has scheduled to gather them in batches for training starting from April 15. The classroom will be borrowed from the Nantong Theater and the Provincial Nantong People's Education Hall.

### Gaoyou

Preparing to Establish Yixing Pawnshop

This county originally had two pawnshops, which were closed down after being looted by the Northern Army in 1927 and have not been restored since. There are only two pawn brokers, Fuchang and Gongji, who deduct 40% per yuan and require waiting five days to redeem items, which is very difficult. Now, Pan Songping and others, merchants from Jiangdu, have gathered 40,000 yuan in capital to open Yixing Pawnshop for the purpose of alleviating poverty. The monthly interest rate is 20%, plus a storage fee of 4%. After submitting the application to the county chamber of commerce and then to the county government for submission to the province for record, it can be opened.

### Legal Tender Exchange Rate Soars

In this county, the exchange rate of copper coins has been soaring recently due to the surplus of copper coins in the market. On the 15th, each yuan exchanged for 2,130 copper coins, which was 120 copper coins higher than 10 days ago, and it is expected to continue to rise.

### Jiaxing

Questions Arise Regarding Advertising Donations

The county chamber of commerce believes that the advertising donations collected by the county government from various industries are not handled in accordance with the regulations. For example, advertising donations must be collected for neon lights and flags set up by stores on their own storefronts or corners of the house, which seems to be in conflict with the regulations for collecting advertising donations. As a result, various industries and stores are quite suspicious. The county chamber of commerce has submitted a report to the provincial chamber of commerce federation for transfer to the construction department for a detailed explanation in order to comply.

### Jiashan

Reorganizing the Collection of Land Tax

County Magistrate Yu Shuluan is currently planning to reorganize the land tax system in the county. It is stipulated that those who complete payment of each term's tax within the first month will receive a 10% bonus of the regular tax and a certificate of commendation. Those who complete payment three months after the start of collection will be penalized 10% of the regular tax. This is to ensure that the tax is cleared annually. The Land Administration Office is also ordered to quickly compile the total number of fields and rivers in the county to plan for submitting a request to the province for reducing surtaxes. On the other hand, after the land registration and issuance of certificates are completed, land value tax will be implemented to equalize the burden on the people. The salaries of the personnel responsible for tax collection will be changed to a commission system. When the collection is smooth, all expenses for collection, except for the commission, will be accumulated and returned to the public.

### Dinghai

"Ao Jiang" Ship Sailing Between Shanghai and Shenjiamen

There has been no dedicated ship running between Shenjiamen, Dinghai, and Shanghai. Passengers have had to transfer via Zhoushan and take ships on the Shanghai-Oujiang route. This was particularly inconvenient during the peak fishing season. Recently, shipping merchant Chen Tianshou and others raised funds to lease the "Ao Jiang" ship to run exclusively on the Shenjiamen-Shanghai route, stopping at Shengshan, Sijiao, Huanglong, Daishan, Qushan, and other ports. It is scheduled to run once every five days, with the maiden voyage on the 23rd.

### Over Five Hundred Students Participate in the Middle School Outstanding Students Association

Director Pan Reports on the Significance of the Association, Tao Baichuan, Jiang Jianbai, and Others Give Speeches

The Joint Meeting of Outstanding Students from Middle Schools, jointly organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters, was held yesterday morning at 8:00 AM at the Hubei Society on Guizhou Road. More than five hundred outstanding students from senior and junior high schools attended. Director Pan presided over the meeting and delivered a report. Tao Baichuan, Jiang Jianbai, and others gave speeches. Students also gave impromptu speeches after drawing lots. At the end, a movie was shown and gifts were distributed. The atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:

Attendees

A total of Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Tao Baichuan of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Jiang Jianbai, Chief of the Fifth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Liu Xuru, Director of the Training Section, Yu Zhongbiao, Executive Secretary of the Education Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and more than five hundred outstanding students from over a hundred schools attended (list attached). The presidium consisted of Pan Gongzhan, Tao Baichuan, and Jiang Jianbai. The General Secretary was Liu Xuru. The Masters of Ceremonies were Nie Haifan. The Recorders were Wang Gongxia and Chen Dongbai. The hosts were Yu Zhongbiao, Peng Zhenqiu, Fan Jiabiao, Wu Xianren, Yang Jialin, Qian Kezan, Jin Zhan, Chen Hongnian, Xiong Pengnan, Gong Xia, Zhai Guanghan, Cao Peimin, Lin Bingcheng, and Xie Chengxun.

Chairman's Report

Director Pan, the chairman, began by reporting that the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters jointly organized the Chinese Outstanding Students Association. The Municipal Party Headquarters had previously held such events. It was not held last semester due to other events. It has now been decided that the Party and government will jointly organize these events. Not only middle school students, but also university and elementary school students will participate in similar joint meetings of outstanding students. The significance is briefly reported as follows: (1) We feel that our country has reached the beginning of a period of revival, and the nation has transformed from a period of decline to the beginning of a period of prosperity. During this period, efforts are needed in all aspects to enable the nation to accelerate its progress on the road to revival. The efforts of young people are especially necessary. Young people are the treasures of the country. If all young people can develop in an all-around way in terms of intellect, morality, physical fitness, and social skills, it will lay the foundation for the revival of the country. Especially young people who are studying in schools should be encouraged to work hard and make progress. On the one hand, it depends on their own efforts, and on the other hand, the supervision and encouragement of the environment also has an impact. Therefore, holding this outstanding student association can help them encourage each other, so that the excellent foundation will not be destroyed, and at the same time, even better talents can be established. (2) No one can say that they are absolutely flawless. Everyone has some strengths and some weaknesses. Therefore, we are not asking everyone to be flawless, but we are asking everyone to give full play to their strengths, so that their strengths exceed their weaknesses. The ancient Chinese sage kings took hiding evil and promoting good as the basis for governing the country and pacifying the world. However, the social customs of China in recent decades have been the opposite. Everyone pays attention to criticizing the shortcomings of others and exposing the bad deeds of others. As a result, there are really no good people in society. Therefore, we must change this and unreservedly hide evil and promote good, and do it from schools. Teachers examine and select outstanding students. In this way, everyone will be willing to be a good student. Although "Is he not a gentleman who does not feel resentful when others do not know him?" Good students do not necessarily have to be known, but they will definitely be happier when they are known. The Analects say, "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?" There is a reason for this joy. Because they study hard, friends from afar come to see them, of course, they are happy. Therefore, the association is to change the bad habit of promoting evil and hiding good. The famous American diplomat Franklin said that his success was that he never spoke of other people's shortcomings, but only praised their strengths. It can be seen that the truth is unbreakable and universal. (3) The greatest help in seeking knowledge is from famous teachers and good friends. The so-called famous teachers are not necessarily famous, as long as they live up to their name and fulfill their duties, they are famous teachers. Of course, there are famous teachers in schools, but good friends are more difficult to find. Therefore, the association is to choose a group of the best friends for you to encourage and supervise each other, which has a great impact on you and the country and nation. There is a Tongwen College in Shanghai, which does not seem to be well known to everyone. However, when Chinese people do not understand the situation in China, they go to Tongwen College. They are all fully aware of it, because their students travel to various parts of China during the holidays to conduct inspections and report to the school. Over time, they naturally understand everything. There are many schools in Shanghai, and they come from all over the country, but why can't they know the situation in their own regions? Because there is no organization, education is a place. Therefore, the association is to give full play to the strengths of each person, unite together, learn from each other, and do it batch by batch. It will definitely make a great contribution to the country and the nation.

Speech by Committee Member Tao

Next, Tao Baichuan, a committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a speech, introducing the youth movements in Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Because these three countries represent three different political systems: Fascism, Communism, and Democracy. (1) The German youth movement has the Hitler Youth, which stipulates that those aged ten to eighteen should participate. In the past, participation was voluntary, but now it is compulsory. The method is to set up summer camps in various places. Many young people go to nearby camps during the holidays, camp together, and live on their own, so that they can meet each other, connect their feelings, and exchange knowledge. The German summer camps have made a great contribution to the world. We hope that Shanghai can also have this facility, so that Shanghai students and young people from the mainland who come to Shanghai can enjoy it, which is much more beneficial than staying in hotels. The second is the labor service corps. China also has it now. They stipulate that those over the age of nineteen must join, otherwise they will not be able to find a job after graduation. The time is half a year. The work is building dikes, logging, shipbuilding, and improving cultivated land. They serve eight hours a day without remuneration. After graduation, they are given a certificate. With this certificate, they can find a job in society, so this has become an obligation. China is still voluntary. (2) The Soviet Russian youth training is the Pioneer Team. All those aged ten to sixteen should participate. They have five rules: (1) Team members should protect their own and other people's bodies. (2) They should be economical with time and not waste it, and use their spare time. Work should be done quickly. (3) They should be diligent, persevere, and be able to cooperate with others. (4) They should cherish public and private property. (5) Do not make oaths, do not smoke, and do not drink. In addition to the rules, there are five wishes, of which one can be put forward. The first wish is that team members should be determined to work for the welfare of workers, peasants, and civilians in the future, that is, not to add flowers to the brocade, but to send charcoal in the snow. The fifth wish is to study hard, because knowledge and skills are the greatest power to seek welfare for workers, peasants, and civilians. Above the Pioneer Team is the Communist Youth League, that is, CX. In the past, they specialized in waving flags, shouting slogans, and posting slogans. Starting last year, they were not allowed to do this political activity, but they did three things: reading, sports, and military training, especially paying attention to sports. Currently, Russia has 4,550 sports fields and 800 swimming pools, which can be seen at a glance. The central government gives CXO medals to those who are good at sports. The meaning is preparation for labor and national defense. (3) The American youth movement organization has CCC, that is, the Citizens' Voluntary Conservation Corps, which does the work of preserving forests. Because the United States produces a lot of wood, and there are large forests everywhere, if they are infested by insects or burned, the losses will be great. Therefore, unemployed young people are recruited and sent to the army. After being organized by military officers, they are sent to forest houses to camp. In the morning, they receive military training. During the day, they build bridges and roads and pay attention to forests. They work eight hours. In the evening, they read books in the camp, teaching vocational knowledge. Food and clothing are supplied by the state, and the monthly salary is thirty yuan, but twenty-five yuan must be sent home. It started to be organized three years ago. According to statistics last year, there were more than 500,000 people. They built 100,000 miles of roads, 30,000 bridges, cleared insects from 5 million acres of forests, and built 150 dams. Its greatness can be seen. From the above youth training of Feng Guojia, we can get the conclusion: (1) The youth movement in the past was done by schools, but now schools are doing it, and government party departments are also doing it, which can be a unified step. (2) The training in the past was only training people, but now, in addition to training people, they also have to be trained into citizens. The words people and citizens are different. People are seen in social aspects, and citizens are seen in national aspects. Citizens are of course people, but people are not necessarily citizens. Good citizens are good people, but good people are not necessarily good citizens. (3) The training in the past was static, and the training now is dynamic. Our Chinese New Life Movement and Labor Service Movement are also like this. I hope everyone will work hard.

Speech by Section Chief Jiang

Next, Section Chief Jiang gave a speech, saying that when he was in middle school, there was also a selection of model students. The standard was to select those with excellent intelligence, morality, physical fitness, and service ability. These model students often served other students. During the May Fourth Movement, these model students were elected to lead the patriotic work. The work went smoothly and the students believed in them very much. Therefore, I got two thoughts from this: (1) Excellent students should be serving others, so they are service students. (2) Since the May Fourth Movement, the students who do the work only know how to move around, and their knowledge, morality, and physical fitness are not good, so they cannot lead. Therefore, we want excellent students to create an atmosphere and set an example.

Student Speeches

The presidium then drew lots to determine three senior high school students and three junior high school students to give speeches. The topics were designated by the Social Affairs Bureau as twelve topics below: (1) Loyalty and courage are the foundation of patriotism. (2) Filial piety is the foundation of managing the family. (3) Benevolence and love are the foundation of dealing with others. (4) Faithfulness and righteousness are the foundation of establishing a career. (5) Peace is the foundation of dealing with others. (6) Etiquette is the foundation of governing the world. (7) Obedience is the foundation of responsibility. (8) Diligence and thrift are the foundation of service. (9) Neatness is the foundation of strengthening the body. (10) Helping others is the foundation of happiness. (11) Learning is the foundation of benefiting the world. (12) Perseverance is the foundation of success. Those who were drawn chose a topic each, and each person's speech time was five minutes. The senior high school students were Zhuo Baoheng of Nanyang Middle School, who spoke on benevolence and love as the foundation of dealing with others; Yao Lianjuan of Wuben, who spoke on perseverance as the foundation of success; and Huang Yanping of Private Shangzhong, who spoke on etiquette as the foundation of governing the world. The junior high school students were Yang Renji of Yucai, who spoke on perseverance as the foundation of success; Huang Nanchang of Zhonghua Vocational School, who spoke on learning as the foundation of benefiting the world; and Shen Dehua of Shenmei Girls' Middle School, who spoke on perseverance as the foundation of success. The topics of each student's speech were drawn on the spot, but they were still able to speak fluently, which was quite commendable.

Distribution of Gifts

After the meeting, gifts were distributed. In addition to a bag of fruits and snacks for each person, there were also gifts such as books. There were 300 packages of Qianmen Tooth Powder from the Family Industry Cooperative, three dozen tubes of Invincible Toothpaste, three copies of the "Complete Map of the Chinese Provinces" from the Shenbao Library, Mussolini's Biography, Kemal's Biography, Roosevelt's Biography, Mussolini's Collection of Speeches, Knowledge of New Weapons, National Defense and Aviation, and Vitalism from Zhengzhong Bookstore, two copies each; Outline of Air Defense, Nursing, and Poison Prevention, New Life of Children, New Life of Students, four copies each; White Girl, Baby Eating and Drinking, Regret of a Misstep, Competition in the Human Bacterial World, Strengthening the Body and Strengthening the Species, Self-Reliance, Huaisheng's Inspection Notes, First Aid, Hailin Liang Practicing Martial Arts, one copy each; two dozen toys from Kangyuan Can Factory, one brocade box, five sets of Middle School Graduation Test Preparation Books from Dadong Bookstore, thirty copies, twenty-eight copies of Children's World from Commercial Press, twenty copies of Oriental Magazine, twenty copies of Education Magazine, three copies of Student Dictionary from World Bookstore, three copies of Scientific Knowledge, three copies of Model Chinese Small Dictionary, one copy of Biography of Scientists, ten copies of Standard National Phonetic Student Dictionary from Zhonghua Bookstore, five copies of Chinese Idiom Dictionary, ten copies of How to Use Punctuation Marks, ten copies of the complete set of National Defense Series, twenty pieces of New Youth Magazine annual subscription certificates for self-collection from Kaiming Bookstore, ten pieces of Middle School Student Magazine annual subscription certificates for self-collection.

### Feng Nianhua's Absence Causes the Chinese Basketball Team to Lose to the Military Academy

The Result is Forty-Eight to Fifty-Nine Feng Arrives For The Second Game Today

▲Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) The Shanghai Chinese basketball team, led by coach Li Baojun, arrived in Nanjing on the 19th. At 4:00 PM on the 20th, they played against the Military Academy for the first time at the Amateur Sports Association. More than a thousand spectators attended. The Chinese team was greatly weakened by the absence of Feng Nianhua and Chen Xianglong. The Military Academy won 59-48. The first half was 29-25, with the Military Academy winning by only four points. In the last five minutes, the score was tied at forty. The Chinese team was unable to sustain their energy, which led to the defeat. Wang Yuzeng played despite being ill and did not perform well. Bao Wenpei and Guo Zhenji were very active. Wang Nanzhen and Zhou Dayun were the most outstanding players in the Chinese team. The second match will be held at the same venue at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Feng Chen and the two generals of the Chinese team will arrive on the evening of the 20th, and the outcome is unpredictable.

### Fourteen Teams Participate in Today's Jiangwan Cross-Country Race

One Hundred and Forty Chinese and Western Athletes Set Off at 11 O'Clock in Hongkou Park

The six-mile Jiangwan team cross-country championship, organized by the Shanghai Sports Association, is scheduled to start at 11:00 AM today at the west gate of Hongkou Park. The Suke and Ermai teams did not register due to events. Therefore, only fourteen teams are participating. The top eight players from each team will be selected. Seventeen individuals are participating, including athletes from China, England, the United States, France, Russia, Japan, India, and other countries. Ninety-one of them are Chinese. The details are recorded as follows:

Competition Rules

(1) Each team shall consist of eight or ten players. However, only the first eight players to reach the finish line will be counted. The remaining players will be considered as individuals. (1) The awards for each team will be determined after the competition. The team with the fewest points will be the winning team. (1) Athletes must not go beyond the prescribed route twelve yards on either side and must not take shortcuts. Violators will be disqualified. Referees will be stationed at each section. After the competition, the numbers of the athletes will be reported. If it is found that they withdrew midway or took shortcuts, etc., (1) Athletes must wear the number cloth on their chest and back. Each team leader should check whether their members have followed these rules. (1) Athletes must not walk slowly. (1) If any disputes arise, the chief referee will decide. (1) Athletes must have resided in this city for more than two months.

Among the teams, the strongest is undoubtedly Wuhe. However, Wuhe only has Wang Zhenglin, Wu Wenlin, Ling Xuewen, Guan Youwen, Zhang Liang, etc. However, the lineup is not very neat. The second is the Shanghai Sports Association A team, which has Niu Hongquan, Li Duan, Ma Riji, Gao Basheng, Xi Peng, Niu Qibao, etc., all of whom are well-known players. The championship will undoubtedly be contested between Wuhe and the Shanghai Sports Association.

Individual Aspects

The individual championship will be contested by Wang Zhenglin, Wu Wenlin, Niu Hongquan, Ling Xuewen, etc. However, Wang Zhenglin's strength is not as strong as Wu Wenlin's. During each practice, it is common to see Wu Wenlin letting Wang Zhenglin arrive first. Recalling the last champion, Wang Zhenglin, and Wu Wenlin were only a foot apart. He, like Li Duan, Ma Riji, Gao Basheng, Xi Peng, etc., all have hopes of finishing in the top ten.

Traffic Issues

Among the sixteen measures for holding the Shanghai Festival annually, the eighth measure stipulates that traffic vehicle and ship fares should be appropriately reduced during the Shanghai Festival. It was originally planned to be jointly organized by the Social Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, convening relevant companies and businesses. It is reported that this matter requires consultation with various transportation companies and the Railway Bureau in charge of the Songhu (Shanghai-Hangzhou) Railway and requires requesting instructions from higher-level agencies for approval, which takes a lot of time. In fact, it is too late to implement it this year.

### Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation

Political Obstacles Must Be Removed First

Central News Agency reports that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, left Nanjing by night train at 11:00 PM the night before and arrived at the North Shanghai Railway Station at 6:50 AM yesterday. He went directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest and plans to stay in Shanghai for two or three days before returning to Nanjing to preside over the Yuan's affairs. According to Sun, cooperation is welcome with any country that treats us equally and does not harm our sovereignty and territorial principles. However, "we will not discuss what is taken, and we want cooperation." We absolutely cannot accept this kind of national cooperation that betrays national interests. Sino-Japanese economic cooperation must first remove political obstacles before it can be realized. Before the issues of eastern Hebei, northern Chahar, and smuggling are resolved, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is impossible to discuss. I would like to tell the people of the whole country that cooperation between the two countries can only be achieved when their strengths are equal. If we want to cooperate with others, we must first have the determination and strength to resist the war. The issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction also depends on our self-improvement. The British coronation ceremony will be attended by Kong Xiangxi, Chen Shaokuan, and Guo Taiqi. I have not yet decided when I will go to Guangdong for inspection.

### Finance Minister Kong Hosted Tea Party Yesterday to Bid Farewell to British Consul-General Brennan

Sir Brennan Boards Ship Today to Return Home

The outgoing British Consul-General in Shanghai, Sir Brennan, and his wife are scheduled to depart for their home country today on the Empress of Asia mail ship and will not hold formal ceremonies. It is reported that they will have lunch on the ship and then receive farewells from friends between 3:00 and 4:00 PM. The Empress of Asia is scheduled to leave the Hongkou Wharf at 4:00 PM, taking the route through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and then to Vancouver. After arriving in England, Sir Brennan will work in the Far East Department of the Foreign Office. On Thursday night, the Shanghai Consular Corps and on Friday night, the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce and the China Association hosted banquets at the Shanghai Club to bid farewell to Sir Brennan. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, and his wife hosted a special tea party at their residence on West Ainsworth Road to bid farewell, and invited Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Shanghai Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, Bell, the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy, Herbert Babbage, the Secretary of the British Embassy's Shanghai Office, Rogers, the British Economic Advisor's representative in Shanghai, Muller, the Commissioner of Customs for Jianghai Customs, Chen Xing, the Vice President of the Central Bank, Xi Demao, the Director of the Business Bureau, and Xu Jianping, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, and their wives. Minister Kong was unable to return to Shanghai due to business, so his son, Ling Kan, represented him in hosting the event and read Kong's farewell speech, which stated, "Sir Brennan and his wife will depart for their home country tomorrow (today). Today, we are honored to gather together. Sir Brennan has made great contributions to promoting Sino-British relations. He will now return home to take a key position in the British Foreign Office. My friendship with Sir Brennan dates back to 1926 when Sir Brennan was the Consul-General in Guangzhou and I was the Director of the Guangdong Finance Department. Our friendship is very close. Today, I recall the process of resolving the issue of the land ownership purchased by the British authorities in Guangzhou City to build the consulate, and I still have joy. Before Shamian was opened as a British concession, the British authorities purchased a piece of land in Guangzhou City to build a consulate. After Shamian had a British concession, the land became useless. At that time, I was the Director of the Finance Department and proposed to return the ownership of the land to the provincial government. Sir Brennan immediately agreed with my proposal and submitted a request to the US Embassy to discuss with the British government and return the land. This matter was resolved and satisfied both parties. Today, I bring up the old matter because it can serve as a clear proof of the British diplomatic spirit of fairness and Sir Brennan's service in the British diplomatic circles, which can be called one of the best. Sir Brennan has been in China for many years and has met many friends from China and abroad. I have been busy with official duties in Nanjing and Shanghai, and I can only hold a brief banquet before their departure to England, and I cannot provide more support, which is a pity. However, what we are happy about is that Sir Brennan's future position will further help his government. Sir Brennan is knowledgeable about the situation in China and has always maintained a friendly attitude towards the Chinese government and people. It is expected that he will be able to make more contributions to consolidating the existing friendly relations between China and Britain. The gentlemen present here will join me in wishing Sir Brennan and his wife all the best for the future," etc. Then, Sir Brennan stood up to reply, expressing his gratitude to Kong and his wife for their hospitality and praise. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 6:00 PM when they dispersed. It is reported that Sir Brennan came to China in 1905 and served in the British Inspectorate of the Chinese Maritime Customs in Beijing. He then successively served as British Consul in Guangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Jinan, and Tianjin. Later, he was transferred to Shanghai as British Consul-General and has been in office for seven years. He is highly regarded among the foreign diplomatic representatives stationed in China and has a particularly deep friendship with the Chinese authorities. Moreover, he has lived in this country for a long time and is knowledgeable about the national situation and the people's sentiments. It is expected that after taking up his new position in the Foreign Office in the future, he will be able to make more contributions to Sino-British relations.

The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent a letter to the British Consul-General and Senior Consul of the Consular Corps, Sir Brennan, on the 20th. The translation is as follows: "Your Consul-General will leave office tomorrow and be honorably promoted to a new position in the Foreign Office. The Council of this Bureau is deeply saddened by the imminent separation. Your Consul-General has cooperated with this Bureau for many years and has always been harmonious. This Bureau is deeply grateful. We hereby express our thanks and wish your Consul-General and your wife a bright future and a smooth and pleasant journey."

### Kong Xiangxi Returned to Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday

Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, accompanied by Vice Minister Xu Kan, Counselor Li Yuwan, and Secretary-General Tan Guang of the Central Bank, took a train from Nanjing at 3:00 PM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 9:26 PM. Kong, who also serves as the Governor of the Central Bank, usually takes the night train to Nanjing every Monday to attend important central meetings and handle important official matters. On Thursdays, he comes to Shanghai from Nanjing to preside over the Central Bank's business and local finance. This time, because he will soon be going abroad, all financial matters must be properly arranged. He has been busy in Nanjing for days revising the Central Bank's Organic Law and reviewing the national revenue and expenditure budget for the 26th year, which has been quite hectic. Therefore, he was delayed until yesterday to return to Shanghai. It is reported that the Central Bank's Organic Law has been reviewed for the last time by the joint meeting of the Legal, Financial, and Economic Committees of the Central Political Committee and will be submitted to the Political Committee for discussion next Wednesday. Regarding the national revenue and expenditure budget for the 26th year, it was reviewed at a meeting of ministers from various Yuan (branches of government) the day before yesterday and has been generally finalized. Although the new budget has increased education and construction allocations compared to before, the balance between revenue and expenditure is a good sign for China's financial future.

### Yesterday Morning's Continued Talks by the Sino-Japanese Trade Association at the Zhou Residence

Noon Banquet by the Three Banks for Kodama and Others, Evening Reciprocal Banquet by Kodama and Others for Various Circles

The Japanese economic leaders, including Kenji Kodama, who have come to China, have been very busy with banquets in Shanghai in recent days. Yesterday, in addition to attending a banquet hosted by the Three Banks and a tea party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, they also went to Zhou Zuomin's residence in the morning to continue their talks, and inquired in detail about the financial and industrial situation in China. They did not leave until noon. It is reported that Ambassador Xu Shiying and Zhou Zuomin, among others, are scheduled to host a banquet for Kodama and others today. The details are as follows:

Continued Talks

Although Kodama Kenji and others have stated that their visit to China is solely for attending the first general meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association held in Shanghai, their main task is to take this opportunity to exchange views on economic cooperation between the two countries. Although all the people who came with him are members of the association, they are also important figures in the Japanese financial and business circles. Kodama and others went to Zhou Zuomin's residence again yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to hold talks. Many directors from both the Chinese and Japanese sides of the association were invited to participate. During the meeting, Kodama and others inquired about the financial and industrial situation in China, and the Chinese directors provided detailed answers and presented various publications for reference. At the same time, the Chinese side also inquired in detail about the economic situation in Japan. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

Progress of the Talks

A reporter from the Central News Agency learned that Zhou Zuomin, Kodama, and others held three symposiums in the International Hotel and Zhou's residence in recent days. All directors of the association and the visiting Japanese personnel participated. The first one was held on the morning of the opening day of the general meeting at Zhou's residence, which was merely to introduce the personnel from both sides and to have general conversations and exchange of opinions. The second one was held the day before yesterday at the International Hotel, which was to continue discussing the progress of the association's affairs. Regarding the establishment of investigation departments by the association in both Shanghai and Tokyo, Zhou Zuomin and Kodama, the two chairmen, were entrusted to be responsible based on the principles passed by the general meeting. The third meeting yesterday morning was more important, as Kodama and others had been able to learn the general will of China through various contacts. However, in order to further understand the actual situation of China's economy and industry, they inquired in detail, and the actual situation in Japan was also clearly explained. When talking about the past, if there were any gaps or misunderstandings, the Chinese side raised questions, and the Japanese side explained them sincerely. As for the sugar, match, and textile industries, the relations between the two countries are more extensive, and many members of both sides are important figures engaged in the above industries. They had earnest discussions, but it is not known whether concrete results have been reached.

Banquet by the Three Banks

The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications hosted a banquet for Kenji Kodama and others at the Central Bank Club on Lujiazui Road in Shanghai West at 1:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 guests and hosts attended. In addition to Japanese Embassy secretaries Tajiri, Yoshioka, Somi, Shimizu, Commercial Attaché Iwai, Financial Attaché Inamori, Consul General Kawai, Consul Fukui, and our Mayor Wu, Director Zhou, the Chinese and Japanese guests were mostly leaders from the financial and business circles of both countries. President Kong Xiangxi of the Central Bank was unable to attend due to official business in Beijing. Vice President Chen Xing, Chairman Song Ziwen of the Bank of China, General Manager Song Hanzhang, General Manager Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications, and other important staff members of the three banks were responsible for the reception. There was much toasting, laughter, and lively conversation.

Chen Xing's Speech

Chen Xing gave a speech on behalf of the hosts, saying, "Chairman Kodama, members of the delegation, today, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have prepared a simple banquet to welcome you. President Kong of the Central Bank is in Beijing on official business, and Chairman Song of the Bank of China is unable to speak due to a cold. Chairman Hu of the Bank of Communications has also entrusted me to speak on his behalf. Therefore, I will represent the three banks to say a few words to you. "You are leaders in the Japanese financial and industrial circles, with rich knowledge and experience. You will definitely be able to provide accurate observations on the development of our country's industry and the improvement of our finance. Since the Meiji Restoration, the development of Japan's financial industry has been very rapid. Of course, there have been difficulties and obstacles, but you have overcome these difficulties and eliminated these obstacles to achieve today's prosperity. You have personally experienced all of this and made great contributions. All of this experience is enough for our country to learn from. Today, we gather together, and I hope that you can give us some guidance. The economic relations between China and Japan have always been very close and have a very long history. There was commercial exchange as early as the Later Han Dynasty. During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, Sino-Japanese trade was at its peak. At that time, the financial relations between China and Japan also arose. Although there were some periods in between when obstacles arose due to other influences, they soon returned to their original state. Therefore, from a historical perspective, the economic relations between the two countries have sometimes been uncoordinated, but through the efforts of the people of both countries, any gaps have been immediately eliminated. In recent years, Sino-Japanese exchange rates have often fluctuated greatly due to the rise and fall of world silver prices. Trade between the two countries has been largely speculative. This is a major obstacle to the future of Sino-Japanese economic coordination. However, since the reform of our country's currency system, this obstacle has been removed, and Sino-Japanese exchange rates have become stable. In the future, Sino-Japanese trade should achieve sound development. Now, with the opportunity of the visit of distinguished guests to China, we can gather economic figures from China and Japan together to study and discuss with a sincere attitude and frank words, and work together. I firmly believe that the future of economic coordination between the two countries and the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity can be achieved." Today's banquet is very simple, and we are deeply honored by your presence. On behalf of our three banks, I would like to raise a glass to wish Chairman Kodama and all members of the economic mission good health and success."

Kodama's Reply

Kodama then stood up and gave a reply, saying, "I am deeply grateful for the gracious hospitality of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications today. I am especially grateful that Chairman Song of the Bank of China attended despite his illness. I have just heard Vice President Chen's speech on how to seek Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, which is a very pertinent point. Our delegation has come to Shanghai and Beijing from Japan, and we have had repeated banquets and speeches, which have been nothing more than three things: how to adjust diplomatic relations, how to harmonize national feelings, and how to advance economic cooperation. I also think so. As the ancient Chinese proverb says, 'As long as we can be honest with each other, it is not difficult to become bosom friends.' If actions do not follow words, then pleasant words are only superficial friendship. I hope that we can all be open and honest with each other and treat each other with sincerity in order to achieve ideal friendship. Today, I am honored to receive such a grand banquet. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to thank you and raise a glass to wish you all good health." The banquet ended at about 3:00 PM.

Zhou's Tea Party

Zhou Jue, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, also held a tea party at the office from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM yesterday. The guests of honor, Kenji Kodama and others, arrived in succession at about 5:00 PM and were personally received by Zhou Jue, Zhao Tiezhang, and others. They were entertained with champagne, tea, and refreshments, and had a pleasant chat for a long time before leaving. The Chinese and Japanese guests who were invited to participate included Xu Shiying, Yang Hu, Zhou Zuomin, Yu Qiaqing, Huang Bodu, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Yisheng, Du Yuesheng, Xu Xiuzhi, Wang Yutong, Zhou Wenbin, Chen Bofan, Hu Boxiang, and Consul General Kawai, Consul Fukui, and Embassy Secretaries Shimizu and Tajiri, totaling more than 100 people. The atmosphere was very grand.

Kodama's Reciprocal Banquet

Kenji Kodama hosted a reciprocal banquet for various circles in China and Japan at the Sixth and Third Garden at 7:00 PM last night. The guests included our Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, leaders of the financial and business circles Chen Xing, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Xinliu, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Zuoting, Li Fusun, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunzhai, Zhong Bingfeng, Xu Xiuzhi, and Japanese Embassy Secretary Tajiri, Consul General Kawai Tatsuo, Commander of the Third Fleet Hasegawa Kiyoshi, Chief of Staff Sugiyama Rokusa, Commander of the Special Naval Landing Force Okawauchi Denhichi, Commander of the Eleventh Squadron Tanimoto Matataro, Naval Attaché Honda Tadao, and leaders of the financial and business circles Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Yoshida Seiji, Sato Kiichiro, Urabe Takuo, Shihi Sen, Tanaka Kanji, Tanabe Teruo, Nishikawa Reiji, Ishida Shuji, Ueda Kenjiro, and Kanou Masaburo, totaling more than 90 people.

At the end, songs and dances were performed to entertain the guests, and the banquet ended late at night.

Future Actions

Kodama will remain in Shanghai and will be the last to leave Shanghai, taking a ship directly back to China.

### Chu Minyi Speaks on Impressions of the Suiyuan Trip

Central Committee member Chu Minyi recently accompanied Chairman Wang on a trip to Taiyuan and then to Suiyuan to attend the memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the Suiyuan defense war and the military parade. He completed his official duties on the 18th and returned to Beijing. He left Beijing on a night train last night at 11:00 PM and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He went straight to his private residence on Avenue Albert for a rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chu yesterday afternoon and had the following conversation:

Impressions of the Suiyuan Trip

According to Chu, Suiyuan is a place he has visited before. He has been there twice before, and this is his third time. He deeply feels that the construction of Suiyuan has made great progress compared to before. It is admirable that Suiyuan is still devoting itself to construction in the midst of war. The morale of the people of Suiyuan is very high, and the officers and soldiers have no arrogance at all. This must be attributed to Chairman Fu Zuoyi's effective leadership. Suiyuan is currently focusing on citizen training. The citizens who were trained also participated in the military parade held in Suiyuan this time. Although they only had one month of training, their steps were neat, and their spirits were full, which was no less than that of the soldiers. This is truly "the strength of the North." Chairman Wang gave two speeches at the memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the Suiyuan defense war and the military parade, which greatly moved the military and civilians.

Construction in Shanxi Province

Director Yan (Xishan) is working hard on economic construction in Shanxi. During his stay in Taiyuan, he talked about the economic construction plan passed by the Third Plenary Session. Yan expressed his determination to promote it. This was my first visit to Taiyuan. I took a short tour of the city and its suburbs in a hurry and deeply felt the progress of Taiyuan's construction. It is a pity that I did not have time to visit various well-equipped factories, which I deeply regret.

A Week-Long Tour of Beijing and Yunnan

For several years, the National Economic Commission has been committed to the construction of highways, and the results have been exceptionally satisfactory. Although Beijing and Yunnan are far apart, a direct highway has been completed. The Executive Yuan has organized a week-long tour group of the Beijing-Yunnan Highway. I was ordered to be the head of the group and invited representatives from various departments, ministries, commissions, business leaders, and the press circles of Beijing and Shanghai. We are scheduled to depart from Beijing on April 5 and reach Kunming via seven provinces: Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan. Then we will return north in two routes. One route will take the sea route back north via Chongqing, and the other route will take the train back north via Guilin and Hengyang. We will stay for one or two days or three to five days in the important cities along the way to conduct inspections in groups. In addition to publicizing the central government's intentions and expressing sympathy for the people's suffering in order to closely communicate between the central government and the local governments, I will also inspect the situation of transportation, education, economy, sports, and national elections.

Progress of National Elections

The preliminary election of representatives to the National Assembly is nearing completion. Now that the election law has been changed, it must wait for the Standing Committee to discuss and pass it next week, and then hand it over to the Legislative Yuan for amendment before proceeding with the second election. The National Art Exhibition is scheduled to open on April 1. I am responsible for the photography aspect. In addition to the more than 100 pieces that have been received, I will also collect the works of famous artists in Shanghai. After the review in Shanghai on the 26th, they will be sent to Beijing for exhibition. I am scheduled to return to Beijing next Tuesday, he said.

### Sixteen Organizations Welcomed Xu Shiying and Xiong Xiling Yesterday

Xu Reported on Various Matters Since His Year as Ambassador to Japan

Xiong Reported on His Attendance at the Conference on the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children

Sixteen organizations, including the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, the Local Association, and various charitable organizations, held a joint tea party at the Sixth Floor of the Pudong Native Place Association yesterday afternoon to welcome Xu Shiying, our Ambassador to Japan, and philanthropist Xiong Xiling. More than 100 representatives from various organizations attended, including Li Dachao, representative of Mayor Wu, Zhang Binghui, representative of Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing, and Chen Heqin.

Wang's Speech

Wang Xiaolai was elected to deliver a welcome speech, which briefly stated, "Today, sixteen organizations are holding a joint tea party to welcome Mr. Xu and Mr. Xiong. I am honored to be able to participate. Ambassador Xu has worked hard for the country and has made remarkable achievements in handling Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Now he is returning to China on leave. Mr. Xiong has been engaged in charitable undertakings in the country, benefiting the disaster victims, and his merits are immeasurable. Now he has returned from attending the Far Eastern Conference on the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children. The colleagues of various organizations in this city admire Mr. Xu and Mr. Xiong for their dedication to the country and the public, and they are holding a tea party to welcome them and gather together to reminisce."

Ambassador Xu's Reply

Ambassador Xu gave a reply, saying, "I was ordered to serve as Ambassador to Japan, and I departed from Shanghai on March 26 of last year and departed from Tokyo on March 26 of this year. I served for a total of one year. Recalling that before I took office, I was warmly welcomed by the elders and friends at sea. The feeling of reluctance at that time is still vivid in my mind. Today, I am also grateful for the welcome from various public organizations. I know the care of you all, and I would like to report on various matters during my year in office. The term of office can be divided into four periods. The first period, from March to July, was a chaotic period because incidents of Japanese people being victimized occurred in Chengdu, Beihai, and Shanghai one after another, and Sino-Japanese relations were becoming increasingly chaotic. In August and September, the incidents of Japanese people being victimized continued to occur, and Sino-Japanese relations became increasingly tense. Therefore, the second period can be called the tense period. After the recovery of Bailingmiao, Japan began to realize that it was necessary to re-examine its policy towards China, and there was a slight opportunity for a shift in relations between the two countries. Therefore, the third period can be called the transition period. After the Xi'an Incident was resolved, the Japanese increasingly realized that our country, both above and below, has been able to unite as one, and the re-examination of the policy towards China has spread throughout the Japanese government and public, and relations between the two countries have been improving. Therefore, the fourth period can be called the improvement period." Xu continued, "I have never handled diplomacy before. This time, I was ordered to serve as Ambassador to Japan, but I only adhered to the four words 'justice and sincerity.' All diplomatic negotiations with Japan were conducted in accordance with the central government's intentions. I deeply feel that the victory or failure of diplomacy lies in seeking oneself, not seeking others. I often hear people say that Sino-Japanese diplomacy is on the verge of collapse. It must be known that those who fear collapse will see collapse immediately. Those who do not fear collapse will never collapse." Ambassador Xu concluded by saying, "In my year in Japan, I saw the virtues of tension, constant tension, and tension in everything filling the country, and I deeply hope that the people of the country will pay attention and follow suit."

Xiong's Report

After Ambassador Xu finished his speech, Mr. Xiong Xiling gave a speech, which reported on his visit to Southeast Asia to attend the Far Eastern Conference on the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children and the current situation of overseas Chinese in the Southeast Asia region. The general content was the same as the report given by Mr. Xiong when he returned to China. The words are long and omitted.

### Japanese and Korean Rogues Transported a Large Number of Copper Coins for Export Yesterday Morning

Seven of Our Customs Officers Were Beaten, One Officer's Hand Bone Was Broken

Central News Agency reported that at 3:00 AM yesterday, about 60 rogues from a certain country transported a large number of copper coins (worth more than 10,000 yuan in national currency) to the Huishan Wharf, hoping to load them onto the Shanghai Maru for export. Upon arrival at the wharf, they were discovered and stopped by our customs officers. The rogues pulled out iron rulers and other weapons and violently attacked the customs officers. Seven officers were injured, one of whom had a broken hand bone. More than 10,000 yuan in copper coins were loaded onto the Shanghai Maru for export.

Shenzhou News Agency reported that after 12:00 PM yesterday, more than 100 Japanese and Korean rogues gathered in the "Japanese Hall" opposite the Huishan Wharf in Tilanqiao, Hongkou. Each person wore specially made clothes made of thick cloth, covered with large pockets, which were special tools used to carry copper coins to Japan. At about 2:00 AM, the more than 100 rogues were all equipped with copper coins, each person carrying about 5,000 coins, totaling about 17,000 to 18,000 yuan. They boarded the Shanghai Maru one after another from Huishan Wharf. Dozens of Japanese and Korean people were stationed along the way from the "White Book Hall" to the Shanghai Maru, and their security arrangements were very strict. After the first group of rogues arrived at the Shanghai Maru, they took over the first-class cabins as if they were high-class passengers. However, at 3:00 AM, just as the last group of rogues was boarding the ship, they were discovered by customs officers, who immediately stepped forward to stop them. The Japanese and Korean rogues then surged forward, surrounding all the customs officers and pulling out their pre-placed iron rulers, short sticks, and other weapons to violently beat the officers. Because there were only seven officers, they could not resist and were all seriously injured. Among them, three Western customs officers suffered particularly severe head injuries. After receiving notification from the customs authorities, the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai sent personnel to the port to mediate and first rescued the officers from danger. Then they ordered the rogues to hand over a portion of the coins. The rogues immediately handed over 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, which were loaded into two trucks and transported to the customs. All the injured officers went to the hospital for treatment separately. On the one hand, the situation was reported verbally to the customs authorities, and they waited for instructions. After this incident occurred, a reporter from Shenzhou News Agency visited Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, to inquire about the customs' opinion on this matter. According to Maze, he had not yet received a written report from the Commissioner of Customs, Bairunson, as of last night, so he was unwilling to express any opinion.

### The Changde Ship Ran Aground Yesterday, All Crew Members Left the Ship

Ran Aground 21 Feet into the Reef, No Water Leaked into Any of the Cabins, The Company Urgently Telegraphed to Stop Them Yesterday

The Changde, owned by the Liyuan Shipping Company in Shanghai, has a deadweight of 2,662 tons, a length of 312 feet, a width of 40 feet and 2 inches, a depth of 24 feet and 7 inches, and a draft of 22 feet and 6 inches. On the 18th, it loaded coal in Qingdao and came to Shanghai. At 2:40 AM on the 20th, the ship arrived northwest of Sheshan, a distance of 20 nautical miles, that is, near Xiaoweishan. Due to the darkness and fog on the sea, it ran aground due to careless navigation. At that time, hundreds of methods were tried, but it was unable to escape danger. The shipowner issued a distress signal at 4:00 AM yesterday morning and telegraphed Shanghai for help. First, it was received by the pilot ship of the customs stationed in Tongsha, which immediately rushed to rescue. However, the ship was heavily loaded and had a deep draft, and it was trapped in the shallow water. The pilot ship tried hard to tow it, but not only did it fail to tow it out, but it also broke its own stern rudder leaf, fearing danger, it had to withdraw. At about 3:00 PM, the owner of the Changde ship continued to send two telegrams to Shanghai (briefly stating that after the ship ran aground, it was observed that fortunately there was no water leakage in the cabins, and all the crew members were still safe, and they hoped that a tugboat would be dispatched quickly to help rescue, etc. After receiving the telegram, the company immediately negotiated with the Ship Insurance Association and sent a tugboat to rescue. Just at about 5:00 PM, it received a third telegram from the ship, saying that the ship had run aground on the reef, more than 21 feet deep. Although the cabins on the ship had not been flooded, the wind and waves in the sea were very strong, and the waves were washing onto the bridge. The shipowner, a Russian named Gu Xun Chu Fu, believed that it had reached a very dangerous situation, so he reported to the Shanghai company that all the crew members had prepared to leave the ship and transfer to the pilot ship accompanying the ship, which would send them back to Shanghai, and decided to abandon the Changde ship, etc. At about 6:00 PM, it received a fourth telegram, saying that the crew had decided to abandon the Changde and leave the ship. The Shanghai company and the Ship Insurance Association were shocked by these two reports and believed that the ship's captain and crew's claim was absurd. As for the point of despair, the ship's cabins were said to have not taken in water, and the shipowner and crew were allowed to leave the ship without authorization and abandon the entire ship without regard. The company immediately telegraphed the Changde ship at 6:30 PM through the coastal radio station, urgently stopping the shipowner and crew from leaving the ship before it sank, and fearing that the crew members were not on the ship, it transferred the telegram to the pilot ship, notifying all the crew members to return to the ship quickly and wait for the rescue ship sent by Shanghai. At the same time, it contacted Leshiaoyang Company and dispatched a large tugboat, which was scheduled to sail to the rescue at noon today. The Ship Insurance Association also sent ship inspector Xu Zufan to the scene to inspect and assist in finding a way to rescue.

### Open Letter to All Workers in the City from the Agricultural and Industrial Life Improvement Association

The Shanghai Agricultural and Industrial Life Improvement Association held its second preparatory meeting at the Xiaoximen Boy Scouts Association at 1:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Dai Youheng, Zhu Guilin, Xu Baoming, Lu Yinchu, Wang Xianqing, Zhang Sheng, Yu Zhenhui, Jin Yaoqiu, Li Weiran, Huang Rusong, Mao Xiaxuan, Wang Gang, Wang Youmei, Zheng Zhenchang, Zhu Chengtuo, Zhou Funong, Yin Yong, Jiao Simian, Hu Menglin, and others attended. Zhang Sheng was elected chairman, and Dai Youheng recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported the approval of the registration with the Social Bureau, and then the discussion began: (1) The draft charter of the association was discussed, amended, and approved; (2) The open letter to all workers in the city was discussed and approved; (3) The solicitation of members was decided to end on April 15; (4) The determination of the work plan was decided to appoint Wang Xianqing, Zhang Sheng, Wang Gang, Lu Yinchu, and Lan Simian to draft it. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM. The open letter to workers is recorded below: Dear workers, our association is meeting you under legal organization. From now on, we will do our best to discuss and study with each other in order to strengthen agricultural and industrial production and improve the lives of agricultural and industrial workers. We will not just issue declarations and stick slogans on the streets, publicizing unfulfilled work on paper to deceive ourselves and others. We vow not to be brokers for our laboring comrades, but to sincerely shoulder the great mission of the labor movement, which is beneficial to the country and the nation. Reviewing the past labor movement and observing the current social situation, we have decided on the correct path for our laboring comrades in the future, contributing to the authorities and assisting them in realizing it as much as possible in order to stabilize social order and save the nation from danger. For nearly a hundred years, we have been subjected to the invasion and oppression of imperialist capitalism, which has sucked the blood and fat from the entire Chinese nation. It can be said that every class has been poisoned, resulting in national poverty and exhaustion, which is beyond remedy. Under these circumstances, we can only work hard and encourage each other in our respective positions. Dear workers, your lives are even more unspeakably painful. You work twelve or thirteen hours a day, and the wages you receive can only maintain the most basic living conditions for some, while others are even ill-clad and hungry. Families cannot support their parents, and children cannot be educated. When disasters, man-made calamities, illnesses, or deaths occur, it is even more miserable. Comrades, the sight of workers enduring hunger and starvation makes us unable to bear thinking about it any longer. But we must also say that are the hardships of laboring life are purely caused by the oppression and exploitation of capitalists? The simple answer is what we said above: "We have been subjected to the invasion and oppression of imperialist capitalism, which has sucked the blood and fat from the entire Chinese nation. "The painful moans of all classes are also unspeakable, but the suffering of laborers is more obvious. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "There are no capitalists in China. Compared with countries with developed foreign capital, there is only a difference between the great poor and the small poor." Then the workers are the great poor, and the so-called Chinese capitalists are only the small poor people. With the labor and capital classes of the great poor and the small poor, their nascent industries need to cooperate with each other and support each other in order to resist the invasion of industrial developers. How can we bear to kill and conflict with each other? Therefore, in a China with backward production, if we want to catch up, we must increase production with one heart and complete the mission of economic construction. This depends on the efforts of each individual in their respective positions, and even more on the laboring comrades and entrepreneurs working hand in hand. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "All the surplus value of industrial production is not solely the result of the labor of workers in the factory. All useful and capable people in society, whether directly or indirectly, contribute to production." Based on this principle, we believe that most useful and capable people will survive together if they unite, and perish if they separate. This is a certain principle. Recently, labor strikes have been rising and falling in the city. Shanghai is full of factories, the environment is complicated, and a slight misstep will have a great impact, not only hindering local public order and production construction but also suffering a major blow. We believe that labor-capital disputes are a normal symptom in countries with developed capital, but in our backward China, we should try our best to avoid them. Therefore, it is hoped that laborers will consider the difficulties of industrial constructors and take legal steps to request improved treatment. Entrepreneurs should also consider the painful lives of laborers, be sincere with each other, and provide as many opportunities for improvement as possible. Do not stubbornly adhere to prejudices, which may lead to the expansion of the situation and cause major social concerns. In short, the entire country has reached a final juncture. We cannot bear to see labor and capital fighting each other and failing to reach a settlement. To restore the country's fortune and revitalize the nation, we can only bury ourselves in hard work, coordinate labor and capital, be tolerant and understanding with each other in order to reach a bright and open road.

### Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association Forms Rural Credit Cooperative

In the past two years, the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association has handled large-scale agricultural loans and established more than 50 production mutual aid societies, achieving excellent results and being praised by the general public. Recently, due to the start of spring plowing in various townships, it has specially worked with the Bank of China to continue handling loans and immediately began to organize production mutual aid societies into formal cooperatives in order to lay a preliminary foundation for rural finance. This work began on the 10th of this month. In addition to the specialists appointed by the association, the Bank of China has also sent Mr. Qian Qixiang to handle the work full-time, going to various townships every day to engage in publicity, meetings, organization, establishment, and reporting to the Social Bureau for registration, etc., without regard to wind or rain, which is commendable. It is reported that there are currently nine established cooperatives, including Wangjianqiao, Shishancheng, Tangjiazhaizhai, and Chenjiazhaizhai, etc., and seven or eight others are in progress. It is expected that about 30 cooperatives will be established by the end of this month. It is expected that loans can be started around April 15. The speed and clarity of the handling and the sincere cooperation of the people with the association are rare.

### Korean Bank Acquires Japanese Shanghai Bank

Accepted by the Bank's Shareholders Meeting Yesterday

According to the Xinsheng News Agency, in order to further its economic aggression in the Yangtze River basin of China, Japan has instructed the Korean Bank to acquire the Japanese-owned Shanghai Bank on Wusong Road in this port to expand its business and make it responsible for this mission. Initially, the shareholders of the Shanghai Bank expressed opposition, but after Mr. Kato Keizaburo, the president of the Korean Bank and a member of the Japanese economic survey delegation, ran around Shanghai for days, a complete agreement has been reached. The Shanghai Bank held a shareholders' meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday and passed the acceptance. The Shanghai Bank originally had a capital of only 100,000 yuan.

### Municipal Hospital Opening Soon, Yesterday Hosted the Press

Li Ting'an Reports on Shanghai's Entire Health Plan, Weng Zhilong Reports on Service Details, Equipment is Excellent, X-ray is First in the Far East

Shanghai Municipal Hospital, after its construction was completed some years ago, and the various departments within the hospital were arranged, began accepting outpatients on January 4th of this year and inpatients on February 17th. The official opening ceremony is scheduled for April 3rd. With the official opening date approaching, the Bureau of Health and the hospital authorities held a tea party in the hospital's reception room at 3 PM yesterday to entertain the city's press. Li Ting'an, Director of the Bureau of Health, Weng Zhilong, the Hospital Director, and Wu Liguo, the Vice President, attended and delivered speeches and reports, and led a tour. Our reporter has recorded the details as follows:

Li's Report on Health Plan

First, Director of the Bureau of Health, Li Ting'an, reported on the entire plan for Shanghai's health undertaking, briefly stating that since Wu Tiecheng became Mayor, more attention has been paid to health facilities. Shanghai's current health facilities are being carried out according to an overall plan. After the Songhu Battle in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], our municipal authorities actively constructed the city center area. In October of that year, the Bureau of Health planned the architectural design of the municipal hospital. By June of last year, the building was inspected and accepted. In August, a director was appointed. The official opening next month will mark the establishment of three health institutions in the city center area. The Bureau of Health will manage the city's health facilities, the municipal hospital will treat citizens' diseases, and the health laboratory will engage in chemical research and other work. In the future, specialized hospitals such as neuropsychiatric hospitals, leprosariums, and tuberculosis sanatoriums are planned to be established. If citizens have minor illnesses, they can go to the health clinics and hospitals in Huhang, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places for treatment. Patients with tuberculosis and other diseases will also have specialized hospitals to enter in the future. Those with more serious illnesses can come to the municipal hospital for diagnosis and treatment. According to the overall health plan, there are eight major affiliated buildings beside the municipal hospital, which will be realized sequentially based on the actual situation. Shanghai is a major port in East Asia, with international attention focused on it, so it is determined to make the municipal hospital's management perfect and seek benefits for the citizens. The hospital will also cooperate technically with National Tongji University in order to develop academics and career simultaneously. Therefore, we have infinite expectations for the municipal hospital.

Hospital Director's Report on Service Situation

Next, Hospital Director Weng Zhilong reported briefly, stating that the Municipal Government and Director Li aim to promote academics, so the municipal hospital is cooperating with Tongji University, one from the government's perspective and one from an academic perspective. Cooperation naturally takes serving society and benefiting citizens as its standpoint. The most important aspects of the hospital's operation are: (1) Emphasizing the courtesy of doctors, nurses, staff, and workers, because patients are sick people and should be treated with extreme gentleness; otherwise, even the slightest lack of courtesy can affect their health. (2) Making things as convenient as possible for poor patients. Therefore, first-class hospital beds account for one-tenth, second-class account for two-tenths, and third-class account for seven-tenths, charging the lowest possible fees and completely waiving fees for the destitute. (3) The Medical Advisory Department. The hospital has specially established a medical advisory department for consultations on academic issues, personal health, or public health. Whether inquiries are made in person or by letter, detailed answers will be provided, which is also an aid to health education. (4) The Social Services Department. A person's illness is related to their personal life, family situation, and social environment in every way. Therefore, treatment methods not only rely on medicine but also require attention to their life and environment. The hospital's responsibility to patients is not only limited to in-hospital treatment or ending after discharge. Regular follow-up visits should be conducted to provide relief or guidance, so that social pathologies can be made healthy, which is what our ancient saying "treat the disease, treat the body, treat the mind" means. In view of this, the hospital has established a social services department with the following objectives: (a) To conduct detailed explorations of the patient's personal, family, and social environment to supplement the tasks of diagnosis and treatment. (b) To promote the above work through investigation, research, and cooperation. (c) To implement relief measures, such as reducing or waiving fees for patients who cannot afford to pay, or subsidizing them with money or introducing them to jobs. (5) Training nurse assistants. The issue of medical care and service for hospitalized patients is of utmost importance. Because the hospital felt that this work could not be done by servants, it recruited nurse assistants and provided them with training. In addition to providing them with the necessary knowledge of medicine, it also provided them with reasonable guidance on etiquette. Last November, a recruitment examination was held at the Bureau of Health, with over a hundred applicants. As a result, 30 people were admitted. Training began on December 1st, teaching subjects such as physiology, anatomy, ethics, and ward work. After one month, practical training began in January of this year, with a plan to assess their fitness for application after two months of practical training.

Wu Liguo's Report on Construction

Finally, Vice President Wu Liguo of the hospital reported on the construction of the hospital, saying that the hospital building is a three-dimensional building that serves as the management office and medical school in the overall plan. Currently, it is only temporarily used as a hospital. It is 80 meters long and 16 meters deep, with six floors in the middle connected to the basement and four floors on both wings. The entire structure is made of reinforced concrete, with artificial stone for the exterior walls. The partition walls of the interior corridors are built with hollow bricks, and the interior partition walls are mostly made of fine wood strips for easy removal and remodeling in the future. The walls of the operating room, delivery room, and disinfection room are made of green tiles. The floors of each patient room are covered with rubber blocks, and the floors of the X-ray room and electrotherapy room are covered with rubber. The floors of the kitchen, dining hall, operating room, and each workshop are covered with polished stone. The patient lounges, reception rooms, and offices on each floor are all made of sandalwood floors. The layout of each floor is summarized as follows: the basement is for installing boilers, meters, machines, etc.; the first floor is for the lobby, reception room, general office, head nurse's office, pediatric clinic, obstetric clinic, dermatology and venereology clinic, X-ray electrotherapy room, social services department, medical advisory department, etc.; the second floor is for the surgical hospital; the third floor is for the internal medicine hospital; the fourth floor is for the pediatric hospital in the east and the obstetric hospital in the west, with the doctor's examination room and patient lounge in the middle; the fifth floor is for the kitchen, dining hall, etc. The hospital's overall plan includes nine main buildings, including two internal medicine hospitals, two surgical hospitals, one obstetrics and gynecology hospital, one pediatric hospital, one outpatient department and eye, ear, nose, and throat hospital, one nursing school and dormitory, and one management office and medical school. In addition, there is one pathology and drug research institute built by National Tongji University, one clinical classroom, and one student dormitory.

Tour of the Hospital's Interior Equipment

Finally, Director Weng and Vice President Wu led a tour of the hospital's internal equipment. (1) The hospital has a total of 181 beds, including 11 first-class beds, 22 second-class beds, 136 third-class beds, 9 intensive care beds, and 3 infant beds. (2) The surgical operating room has all the necessary instruments and sterilization equipment for surgical applications, especially the latest automatic surgical table and shadowless lamp. (3) The physical therapy department has a high-altitude sun quartz lamp, a Kolomeia quartz lamp, an Oken-style thermal light lamp, a Gaiffe-Erbe galvanometer, a short-wave diathermy machine, and a Sanatao X-ray machine. In particular, the X-ray therapy machine is the latest German product, sold to the Far East, and this is the first one. (4) The kitchen uses hot steam to cook rice, gas to cook vegetables, and electric stoves to cook liquids and soft foods, in order to avoid smoke from firewood and coal. When the food is cooked in the main kitchen, it is sent to the small kitchens on each floor by an automatic food delivery machine, and then distributed to the patient rooms by nurses. Both the main kitchen and the small kitchens on each floor are equipped with refrigerators and steam sterilizers. Utensils such as bowls, plates, spoons, and chopsticks are always steam-sterilized after each use. (5) The gauze and medical equipment used in the hospital are sterilized with high-pressure steam each time. (6) The hospital rooms use electric lights instead of electric bells for patients to call, and the management is very thorough.

### Old Gate Police Station Dectects Arson Group

Organization Set Up on Dongxi Huade Road, Defendant's Bag Searched Out Seals, Westerner Hawkins Testifies in Court

The Old Gate Police Station recently received a tip-off that someone was organizing an arson group to defraud insurance money, so they conducted a strict investigation. As a result, Chinese detective Lu Gengsheng, detective Wang Yingjie, and Bao detective Zhu Shangwu, etc., successively arrested Chen Wentao (employee of Baohong Insurance Company), Wu Youfu from Jiaxing (also known as Wu Yingbai), Shen Zixiang (also known as Yin Boji), Zhou Wenwei from this city (employee of North America Insurance Company), Jiang Baoru from Zhejiang (employee of Weili Insurance Company), Zhong Wenbin from Ningbo (manager of Shenchang Insurance Company), Cao Yufu from Jiading (associate of Shenchang), and seven others. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, this case was brought up for trial in the First Criminal Court by Judge Qian Hongye. The defendants hired lawyers such as Fan Gang, Jiang Baoli, Lu Qi, Xiong Fei, Deng Jiabing, Huang Xiubo, and Ling Qihong to defend them. Many relatives and friends of the defendants also attended the court. First, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the defendants in this case were related to the arson that destroyed the building at No. 4, Lane 1024, Dongxi Huade Road on January 19th of this month, so they were prosecuted for arson and fraud under Article 173, Paragraph 1, and Article 339 of the Criminal Law. He presented the facts of the case in detail, taking over an hour. The following is a summary: According to lawyer Ru, the defendant Wu Youfu previously discussed arson with someone named Little Hu, who is currently at large, in order to obtain insurance money. At that time, Wu paid Little Hu 600 yuan as a fee for handling this matter. They then rented the house at No. 4, Lane 1024, Dongxi Huade Road for 60 yuan per month, and found a Gao couple to live in it, giving them considerable compensation. However, they did not have any familiar insurance brokers, so last October, Wu

Met Zhou Wenwei at the Tongyu Chun Tea House

Through Zhou's introduction, they entrusted Zhong Wenbin and Cao Yufu to insure 3,500 yuan in the name of Lu Yunfu with Weili Insurance Company, 3,000 yuan in the name of Cen Ziying with Weili, and 2,700 yuan in the name of Yin Boji with Baohong Insurance Company, all of which obtained insurance policies. Then, on January 19th, they carried out the arson. However, after the fire, the police suspected arson. According to the insurance company's regulations, policyholders who have suffered a fire must apply to the company for compensation within 15 days, so they ordered detectives to wait at each insurance company. However, as a result, no one applied to the company for compensation within these 15 days. It was only learned now that, two days after the arson by Wu et al., the Fuzhou Road Fanhua Clothing Company arson incident occurred.

The case was solved by the police

And severely punished by your court. All newspapers have records of this matter, so they did not dare to immediately apply to the insurance company for compensation. Baohong Insurance Company received a confidential letter before this incident, stating that the policyholders handled by Chen Wentao all had intentions of arson. The company paid attention to Chen and notified the police to monitor his actions, but because there were no flaws, they could not arrest him. However, on February 15th, a fire also broke out at the Dazhong Flower Factory at No. 1455 Huade Road, but it did not cause a disaster and was quickly extinguished. However, the fire brigade and the police did not receive a report, and the factory had fire insurance of 23,000 yuan with Baohong Insurance Company. This insurance was handled by Chen. Afterwards, Baohong Company sent Hawkins, a Westerner from Yunping Public Firm, to assess the value. Hawkins determined that the factory's loss was 166.2 yuan, but the factory's application for compensation requested 500 yuan. At that time, Chen Wentao visited Hawkins at Hawkins' private residence at No. 432 Hamilton Building and discussed with Hawkins, saying that he intended to have Dazhong withdraw the 500 yuan application

And change it to 700 yuan

Then have Hawkins re-evaluate it to 500 yuan, promising to pay Hawkins 100 yuan. However, Hawkins had been entrusted by Baohong to pay attention to Chen's actions, and the police were also monitoring Chen very closely, so Hawkins agreed to do so at that time. As a result, Baohong did issue a Macali Bank check for 532.2 yuan and handed it over to Chen to forward to Dazhong. On one hand, detectives tracked Chen Wentao. After Chen received the check, he immediately went to Macali to cash it, and then went to Hawkins to give him 100 yuan as a reward. At the same time, he also talked to Hawkins about the Dongxi Huade Road case, also asking Hawkins for help, promising to give Hawkins 500 yuan if it was successful. At that time, Hawkins needed to meet with the policyholder Yin Boji. On the 8th of this month, Chen led the defendant Shen Zixiang to Hawkins to meet, saying that he was Yin's representative. However, Shen was hired by Wu Youfu for 50 yuan to impersonate Yin Boji. Later, fearing that Shen would cheat, Wu, Chen Wentao, and Shen Zixiang went to Hawkins' home on November 11th and were arrested by detectives.

Copied Out From Shen's Bag

An Yin Boji seal, and a Cen Ziying seal was copied out from beside Wu. After confessing, Zhou Wenwei, Zhong Wenbin, Cao Yufu, and Jiang Baoru were arrested. The relationship between Jiang Baoru and this case was that he had been entrusted by Wu Youfu et al. to lobby Liang, a buyer from Weili Company, asking him to make this happen, promising to give Liang 500 yuan as a reward, and he could also get 100 yuan. Therefore, the police prosecuted him together. Next, Hawkins testified about the process of Chen Wentao's negotiations with him. After Judge Qian Hongye interrogated each defendant, he ordered that the case be adjourned for further questioning. Defendants Jiang Baoru, Zhong Wenbin, and Cao Yufu were each allowed to post a 500 yuan bail, and the rest were returned to custody.

### Defamation of Xue Xiangyun Case, Wang Yongquan Sentenced to Six Months

Verdict Announced in Court Yesterday, Wang Genbao and Xu Shi Were Found Not Guilty

Xue Xiangyun, the daughter of the late dye tycoon Xue Baorun, had been married to real estate merchant Xu Liangchen for more than ten years and had no children. Suddenly, Wang Yongquan, the former chauffeur of the Xue family, requested in the civil court of the First Special Court to confirm that his son Wang Genbao was the illegitimate child of Xu Xue Shi. After the verdict, Wang Yongquan lost the case. Xu Xue Shi then hired lawyers Zou Sentang and Shen Pei to file a separate criminal case in the First Special Court, accusing Wang Yongquan and his son Wang Genbao of jointly defaming, instigating perjury, and defrauding money. After repeated interrogations, Xu Xue Shi obtained a review from the Zhenru Forensic Institute, confirming that Xu Xue Shi had indeed not given birth, as reported in this newspaper. At 2 PM yesterday, Judge Pan Zhenyang took the seat in the Second Criminal Court to continue the interrogation. After questioning Xu Xue Shi and the two defendants Wang Yongquan and Wang Genbao, the defendants filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The court ruled that the case was clear and ordered the debate to begin. The lawyers for both sides debated for a long time, and Judge Bo delivered the verdict in court. Wang Yongquan was found guilty of attempted fraud and sentenced to six months in prison. Wang Genbao and Xu Xue Shi were both found not guilty. During the appeal period, Wang Yongquan was sent to jail.

### Jade Art Pre-Exhibition Closed Last Night

The pre-exhibition of jade art pieces for China's participation in the Paris International Exposition, which began on the 6th at the fourth floor of the Da Xin Company, ended successfully at 6 PM yesterday after fifteen days. In total, over the past half month, the number of visitors each day has been extremely crowded, reaching over 100,000. For the first ten days, there were many group visits, with people rubbing shoulders and hardly any room to move. Therefore, the exhibition was extended for five days and limited to individual admission tickets, so important figures in Beijing could leisurely observe the exhibition. The grand situation can be described as unprecedented. The various treasures are now being collected and packed. The three jadeite masterpieces are also being disassembled and packed into 30 boxes. The boxes are all made of mahogany and lined with velvet to prevent shaking. The box manufacturing alone cost 3,000 gold. The date of departure to France has not yet been decided.

### Cigarette Tax Increase, Wholesale Price Increase

Shanghai South Tobacco Exchange Store Requests Association

Please Tobacco Companies Distribute Tobacco According to Households

The Shanghai South Branch of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association received a letter yesterday, jointly sealed by over 500 members, including Wanshengyuan, Dashun, and Chengchang, stating that they heard that the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance plans to increase the unified cigarette tax from April 1st, changing it to a four-tier system, adding 20% to the original amount of 50, 100, 200, and 400 yuan. After inquiring with various tobacco companies, they said that they had not received a clear document from the authorities, so it was difficult to confirm. Our stores purchased tobacco from wholesale stores on the 19th and 20th, and the prices had already increased, with inconsistent chaos. The price of each carton increased by 5 fen, 1 jiao, and 2 jiao, etc., and they could not be approved as usual. Wholesale peers could pre-order whole batches of tobacco for storage from the company, but our retail peers had money but no place to approve it, resulting in retail peers having no tobacco to meet the market demand, and business was greatly affected. Therefore, we jointly sent a letter requesting that your association quickly request each tobacco company to distribute a certain amount of tobacco to each member peer on a daily basis to meet the needs of retail customers, so as to maintain business and ensure livelihood. According to this, the branch held an emergency meeting at 4 PM yesterday. After public discussion, it was decided that (1) a letter should be sent to various tobacco companies such as Nanyang, Huacheng, Hexing, Zhongnan, Fuxin, Ruilun, and Yongtaihe, requesting that they distribute tobacco to each member store according to the household. (2) Members should be notified to send a responsible representative to the association office at the Dananmenkou from 8 AM to 9 AM on Monday (i.e., the 22nd of this month) to discuss the procedures for receiving the allocated tobacco. (3) Others omitted. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 6 PM.

### Wu Zhenjue Sues for Return of Wife's Coffin

The Jiangsu High Court Remands the Case, Wang Xiaoshu Taken Into Custody

Wang Xiaoshu, 33 years old, is an administrator of the Zhabei Charity Group. He previously seduced Wu Zhou Shi, the wife of Wu Zhenjue, a staff member of the Road Bureau living at No. 330, Lane 148, Shanzhong Road, and ordered her to abscond. In June of last year, Wu Zhenjue privately prosecuted Wang Xiaoshu for abduction in the local court. Judge Shao Qinzhi heard the case, released Wang Xiaoshu on bail, and ordered mediation to no avail, so he ruled that the case was not proven and declared Wang Xiaoshu not guilty, and rejected the plaintiff's private prosecution. Wu Zhenjue was unwilling to accept the fact that his wife was seduced and he lost the case, so he narrated the facts and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court for relief. After the High Court reviewed the circumstances, the first-instance judge's judgment was found to be inappropriate, so the original judgment was revoked and remanded to the Shanghai Local Court for retrial. Therefore, Chief Judge Cai Dingcheng opened the court for trial yesterday. According to Wu Zhenjue's statement, Wang Xiaoshu abducted my wife Wu Zhou Shi. My wife has not divorced me. My wife was abducted in June of last year. Now I hear that my wife is dead. During the first instance, Judge Shao persuaded us to mediate. Because Wang was a classmate, I considered the friendship of classmates, so I asked the judge to judge the defendant leniently, not for the purpose of money. Therefore, the judgment based on this was unreasonable, so I disagreed. Now I ask for a retrial according to the law, etc. To this, the judge asked Wang Xiaoshu to state that he had known and lived with Wu Zhou Shi since 1934 for three years, but Wu and his wife had already divorced. As for in July 1936, because the plaintiff came to snatch the divorce certificate, he went to the Public Security Bureau to investigate. Wu Zhou Shi and Wu Zhenjue divorced, which was certified by lawyer Fei Guoxi, so the plaintiff later withdrew the lawsuit. Wu Zhou Shi died of illness on September 14th of last year. At that time, I was not in Shanghai, and my younger brother entrusted the charity group to collect the body. To this, the plaintiff Wu Zhenjue stated that the divorce certificate was forged, and presented Wang's personal contract, and requested a judgment ordering the return of his wife's coffin and compensation for damages of 5,000 yuan, etc. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for investigation and retrial, and the defendant Wang Xiaoshu was taken into custody.

### Shanghai County Limits Deadline for Eliminating Opium; Implements Measures for Elderly Smokers

Those Over Sixty Years Old: Three Warnings Will Be Given

The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stipulating that elderly smokers should be given warnings in stages before being required to quit, urging them to voluntarily reduce their consumption. The original order stated: "Upon investigation, elderly smokers in various counties often suffer from physical weakness and multiple illnesses. Once forced to quit, other ailments often develop, endangering their lives, which is truly pitiful. However, setting a deadline for eliminating opium is a established government policy, and it cannot be altered due to a small number of elderly smokers. For the sake of reducing the pain and danger of the quitting period, smokers themselves should voluntarily and gradually reduce their consumption before being forced to quit. The smaller the consumption, the easier it will be to quit. If they can quit on their own, it will be even more appreciated by the government. This government is deeply concerned that many ignorant smokers lack the opportunity to become aware of this themselves. Therefore, it is stipulated that county governments should give elderly smokers aged sixty and above their first written warning six months before the quitting deadline, reminding them that the deadline is only six months away and that they should immediately voluntarily reduce their consumption in order to reduce the pain and danger of quitting. Two months later, the government will issue a second written warning, alerting them that the quitting deadline is approaching and that they should further voluntarily reduce their consumption. Two months after that, the government will issue a final written warning, urging them to reduce their consumption and comply with the deadline for quitting, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating opium by the deadline. Elderly smokers entering the rehabilitation center should be carefully cared for to facilitate the implementation of the prohibition policy. In addition to issuing separate orders, the county magistrate is hereby ordered to implement this earnestly, and the county hospitals or opium addiction treatment centers are ordered to comply." It is said that the county has already instructed the various opium addiction treatment centers to comply after receiving the order.

### A Major Fire Broke Out at Jihua Hall on Yunnan Road Last Night

Fire broke out in the middle of the night; all employees were already sound asleep. Ladder broke, two people were burned and injured in falls

At 11:43 last night, a sudden fire broke out at Jihua Hall Pharmacy, located at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Six Malu. Although the entire Central Fire Brigade was dispatched to fight the fire, the result was that the decades-old store, with six large bays, was completely destroyed. Details are as follows:

Self-Made Products All Destroyed

The main branch of Jihua Hall Pharmacy in this city is located at the Yunnan Road intersection, with street numbers from 41 to 51, totaling six large bays. It is a giant in the Shanghai pharmaceutical industry, founded by Yuan Yaoqing from Zhenjiang. Since its establishment, it has had a very long history. In addition to its most famous self-made products such as Chicken Brand Yuan's Bone Pain Relieving Liniment and Bone Pain Essence, the store also sold products from major pharmacies and cosmetics, with extremely prosperous business.

Fire Extinguished After One and a Half Hours

At 11:43 last night, a fire suddenly broke out downstairs at number 51, the fifth bay north of the Central Cinema on the side next to it. The Central Fire Brigade dispatched all vehicles to fight the fire. It took one and a half hours to extinguish the fire, but the entire store was completely destroyed. Renji Shantang to the south and the Central Theater to the north were not affected.

Ladder Breaks, Employees Injured

The store closes at around 9:00 PM every night, so when the fire broke out, more than 20 employees in the store were already asleep. The most unfortunate incident was that the fire broke out downstairs at number 51, where the ladder was located. It was the first to break, causing apprentice Mao Yinchang (age 17) from Jiangbei and old clerk She Fufa (age 28) from Jiangbei to be burned and seriously injured in the jumps from the building.

Six People Escaped?

Firefighters rescued partners Wang Peisen (age 27) from Yangzhou and employee Wu Chunheng (age 29) from this city from the fire. All four were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to eyewitnesses, only six people were rescued after the fire broke out. According to the number of employees that the store had, being 20 to 30, it is still in doubt whether or not all the employees had gotten out as only 6 were seen rescued. Because the situation was chaotic at the time, it was impossible to investigate in detail.

Fragrance Filled the Air During the Fire

As for the cause of the fire, some say that the pharmaceuticals contained highly explosive substances, while others say that it was caused by an electrical short circuit. There are many rumors, but the police are investigating to determine the cause. Also, because the store sold cosmetics, a fragrance filled the air during the fire, causing more passersby to stop and watch. At the time of this newspaper's deadline, the fire had not yet been completely extinguished.

### Zhu Qinglan and Others Telegraph Regarding the Tragic Situation of the Henan Disaster

Hoping that Colleagues in Shanghai Will Do Their Best to Solicit Donations; Donating One More Yuan Means Saving One More Person

Xin Xin News Agency reports that Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the Relief Committee, and Mu Ouchu, Lu Bohong, and others departed from Shanghai last Tuesday to go to Henan for disaster relief. Zhu and others telegraphed the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations in this city, which is raising funds for the drought in Henan, stating, "We arrived in Kaifeng this morning and met with Chairman Shang and others. We have a deep understanding of the tragic situation of the drought in western Henan. Many victims are eating vegetable roots and tree bark. The most severely affected counties number as many as twenty-seven. There has been no rain to this day, and it is impossible to plant seeds, causing immense suffering. The provincial government is indeed doing everything possible to provide relief, and the Relief Association is also enthusiastically working to benefit the disaster victims. However, the disaster is widespread, the population is large, and the provincial funds are exhausted. We deeply hope that colleagues in Shanghai will do their best to solicit donations. May compassionate relief and righteous aid come continuously, as donating one more yuan can save one more person. In addition to telegraphing Minister Kong to request disaster relief funds, we are telegraphing on behalf of the disaster victims, hoping for your consideration." Zhu Qinglan, Mu Ouchu, bowed.

### A Lawsuit Between Two Partners at Xu Chongdao's Tenth Branch Over One Dollar

Colleagues Suing Each Other is Quite Absurd; The Case is Already Clear, and the Verdict is Scheduled for the 27th

Zhang Bin, a native of Nantong, age 46, the manager of the tenth branch of Xu Chongdao National Pharmacy, located on the left side of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Second Special District Court, Criminal Division, accusing Yu Zhixiang, the director of the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Department in the same store, of two crimes: interfering with freedom and defaming reputation, requesting that he be investigated and prosecuted according to the law. According to the complaint, the court summoned both parties to the Criminal Division Two courtroom yesterday morning to be questioned by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. Both parties had lawyers present. The plaintiff claimed that he had been working at Xu Chongdao Pharmacy for more than ten years and had been the manager of the tenth branch for several years. On the fifth of last month, the defendant made phone calls at will without following store rules. The plaintiff stopped him with the shop rules, leading to an argument. The defendant then publicly said that the plaintiff had stolen one dollar from his Ginseng and Bird's Nest Department in the twenty-first year of the Republic, thus interfering with the plaintiff's freedom and reputation. The plaintiff requested an investigation and trial. The judge said, "You are colleagues in the same store. It is quite absurd to sue each other over one dollar." Zhang replied, "Although one dollar is a small matter, he said that I stole one dollar. Since I cannot gain the trust of others and cannot restrain the store's staff, reputation is the second life of a person. Since my reputation has been damaged, I cannot survive in society and must request a thorough investigation." When Yu Zhixiang was questioned, he testified that he had been the director of the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Department at Xu Chongdao for several years. "My business requires making phone calls. He (referring to Zhang Bin) unreasonably prevented me from making phone calls. In the twenty-first year of the Republic, one dollar was missing from my department, which is a fact that everyone knows. I never said that he stole it. His lawsuit is completely because he asked me for three yuan in illegal commissions every month. From the twenty-first year of the Republic until the end of last year, I paid him a total of 154 yuan. At the end of last year, I declared that I would stop paying. He held a grudge against me. On the fifth of last month, I was making phone calls. He used that as an excuse to stop me and fabricated accusations. I want to countersue him and request that he be prosecuted for false accusation." When the plaintiff was questioned about whether he had taken three yuan from the defendant every month, Zhang replied that it was a shop bonus and not an illegal commission. At this point, the court believed that the case was clear and ordered the closing arguments, then announced that the verdict would be announced at 9:00 AM on the 27th.

### An Old Woman Angrily Accuses Her Lover

Zhu Shao Shi Is Heartbroken Over Lost Fortune, Zhang Changfu Abandons Old Love for New

Zhu Shao Shi, an old woman from Nantong, is 62 years old and lives at Qichang Zhan in Pudong. She has been a widow for a long time and has considerable savings. When she was 54 years old, she cohabited with Zhang Changfu, who was 44 years old. The old woman spent eight hundred yuan in cash on him and bought him clothes totaling more than one thousand yuan. Since July of last year, Zhang has not returned. When she went to look for him, she was driven away. Zhang also lured away and hid the old woman's young daughter. The woman was very angry and had run out of money, which made things difficult for her. Therefore, she sued Zhang Changfu in the local court, requesting that he pay her five yuan per month for maintenance for ten years, and return the one thousand yuan she was cheated out of, as well as return her daughter. The court was convened yesterday by Judge Wang Kequan. The defendant did not arrive. The judge ordered that litigation fees of 33.5 yuan be paid for a further hearing.

### An Employee Steals Blank Checks and Chops, Forging Them for Fraudulent Gain

Shu Fushun Fraudulently Withdraws Funds; Wu Houbao Pays a Settlement

Shu Fushun, an employee of the Tonghe Meal Company located at 217 Wuchang Road, secretly stole two blank checks from the company between January 6th and February 1st of this year. He carved a chop of the owner, Cantonese Wu Huanan, and had his friend Chen Axiang withdraw a total of 922.3 yuan from the Yong'an Hongkou branch of the North Sichuan Road Bank. After fraudulently withdrawing the funds, he fled back to his home at 47 Yangmiaoqian in Hainanmen, Ningbo Town. After the incident, the Hongkou Police Station dispatched Detective Fang Fucheng, carrying a letter from the First Special District Court, to Ningbo to cooperate with the local Public Security Bureau. He was arrested at his address, and five yuan in cash, a gold ring, and a watch worth about 28 yuan were found on him. He was brought to Shanghai and handed over to Criminal Division Three. He confessed that he had spent 420 yuan of the money he had obtained on buying groceries, and that 500 yuan was deposited in the Shanghai Savings Bank at Xiaodongmen in this city, but the passbook was left in a suitcase in his Ningbo home. He was ordered to be detained and the hearing rescheduled. However, the funds in the bank were withdrawn by someone. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen convened court for further questioning. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that the defendant's relative, named Wu Houbao, had paid the plaintiff 300 yuan. The stolen goods bought by the defendant were worth over one hundred yuan and could be sold to obtain funds for compensation. The plaintiff's civil lawsuit was being mediated. For the public prosecution of forgery, he requested that the case be prosecuted according to the law. Judge Xiao questioned the defendant and learned that the Shanghai Bank passbook was indeed taken to Shanghai by his family to withdraw funds after he was arrested. The judge then ordered him to be detained again and scheduled a verdict. The stolen goods and property obtained from the stolen goods will be returned to the original owner.

After hearing the statement, the police chief found the situation pitiful and ordered the local constable Zhang Qinpu to report the death to the court for examination.

On the 8th of this month, two of the newspaper's workers, Tong Deyue and Yang Zhaoyun, encountered Bai Luoji and his friends on Avenue Dubail near the Cathedral of Our Lady, and went up to demand the money, resulting in a conflict and argument. They started to fight, and as a result, Tong's eye and thumb were injured by Bai and his friends.

### Securities

Government Bonds Still Being Pushed Up

Adopting the Speculative Tactic of Buying Near-Term and Selling Far-Term Contracts

Raising "Jin Chang" and "96" to Flank and Harass

Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange still saw a forced continuation of the upward trend. Except for Category A bonds, all varieties saw new high prices again. The market price was so high, yet buyers did not consider it expensive. Various rumors circulated, but all seemed inconsistent with reality. In practice, it had little to do with the rise in government bonds. The reason for this rise was mostly due to the gold and yarn gangs imitating the methods used to push up cotton yarn prices. One party bravely bought near-term contracts, not hesitating to raise market prices to arouse the interest of the general public. The other party bravely sold far-term contracts, with the amount exceeding the number of contracts bought. The near-term contracts were prepared for delivery upon payment, while the far-term contracts were prepared for future physical delivery. This kind of maneuver only requires [missing text]. Therefore, the market price prospects from next week onward, with two days remaining in this month, it is feared that the market price will not be allowed to suddenly decline. After the end of March, the market price rise and fall will not be the concern of the manipulators, and it will be allowed to run its natural course. However, because a large number of physical goods are being delivered, the market price will naturally collapse due to the outflow of funds from retail investors. Therefore, the danger still lies ahead. Looking at yesterday's activity, in the morning opening, only Category E bonds saw a compensatory rise of 7 jiao and 1 jiao, and then immediately weakened, with a slight rebound, falling by 1 jiao to 4.5 jiao. Numbers 5, 10, 32, and 43 were sold. In the second session, the bulls again tried to push up prices, leaving no effort unspared. Except for the Category E bonds for this month, which rose by a small 4 jiao, the rest rebounded by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. However, the upward force was already limited. In the afternoon opening, they raised the price of Category E bonds for the far term, which suddenly rose by 7 jiao. Later, some retail investors naturally helped to raise prices. However, the sellers, fearing the strong buying sentiment, gradually withdrew, so the bulls did not need to push up prices any further. The front rows were slightly lower, and the back rows were slightly firmer. However, the bulls, fearing that morale was not strong enough and that their strength was already insufficient, engaged in raising the prices of "Jin Chang" and "96." "Jin Chang" soared by 3 to 4 yuan, and "96" broke through the 10 yuan mark again, flanking and harassing to confuse people. The danger of the future is also increasing day by day. The market price results showed a uniform increase of 2 to 3 jiao to 1 yuan. There was no change in Category C bonds for this month. The total transaction volume was 11,843,500 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan; transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Yarn and Cotton

Spot Sales Relatively Lackluster

Near-Term Yarn Plummets in the Afternoon

The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the momentum turned mediocre. American cotton, which had been soaring continuously, suddenly fell for three consecutive days, and the price of three-grade yarn also fell back. At the same time, although the spot yarn sales floor was not bad, it was less than the previous day. It has been found that the transaction volume has been as high as 25,000 to 26,000 bales in the past week. There may be a temporary pause. Therefore, the bulls took profits, and the market showed a slight pullback. However, part of the gold industry gang turned from short to long, and many Indian merchants also covered their short positions. As for the future situation, it should still depend on the actual demand for progress and retreat.

Future Marked Yarn Fluctuations Still Slight

The marked yarn market opened in the morning, and the price of each month saw a slight decline due to the American variety falling for three consecutive days, and the price of three-grade yarn also fell. Unexpectedly, when the second session opened, the near-term market suddenly tightened, and retail investors were particularly eager to cover their positions. This was mainly because yarn sales had improved in recent days, and some gentlemen were holding on tightly. Therefore, the market was relatively firm, but the far-month was flat due to the impact of the overseas yarn and cotton market rebounding and weakening. The marked yarn results showed that the near month rose by 1 yuan to 1.1 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the far month fell by 0.9 yuan. The market situation was mixed when the afternoon session opened, and the situation was slightly frustrated. After the second session, the near-term price fell step by step. At the same time, the spot yarn business was not as strong as the previous day. It is said that Dafeng Factory sold 2,000 bales this month. The closing price fell more sharply, while the far month was still flat. As a result, the near month fell sharply by 2.1 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning, and April also fell by 1.2 yuan. The far month rose by 0.1 yuan and remained unchanged. Hengyi sold 1,100 bales, Hexing 5,200 bales, Gengfeng 2,950 bales, Changji 800 bales, Wang Taixing 3,800 bales, Taichang 1,250 bales, Yichang 3,100 bales, Mingde 4,700 bales, and Chengji 850 bales. Dafeng bought 2,000 bales, Dafu 1,000 bales, Jinchang 4,750 bales, Shenda 1,100 bales, Senkang 2,350 bales, Changfeng 8,000 bales, Dachang 1,300 bales, Shengyuan 2,400 bales, and Tonghe 2,250 bales. The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Sales Volume Over 2,000 Bales

Overseas Yarn and Cotton Plummets

Cotton Market Also Turns Downward

Sufficient Deliveries of Cotton This Month

The Trading Floor Is Full of Selling Voices

The cotton market continues to be weak due to the further decline in American cotton, which has fallen by 50 points compared to the high price. Indian cotton has also fallen sharply. The price of three-grade cotton has fallen even more severely. In addition, there are sufficient chips for delivery this month, and most of them are 16-count raw materials. The demand for this cotton is currently not strong from the factory side. Therefore, the market is even more depressed.

Marked Cotton Falls Again with External Cotton

The marked cotton market opened in the morning, and the price of each month continued to fall because American cotton continued to fall by 19 to 23 points, Indian cotton fell sharply, with 5.5 to 7.75 rupees, and Osaka's three-grade cotton fell by more than 1 yuan. Therefore, morale was slack, and in addition, there were sufficient chips for delivery this month. The marked cotton results showed that the price of each month fell by 0.15 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The situation was more or less the same when the afternoon session opened, and those who took profits covered their short positions. The market situation was firm, but later the market trend became weaker due to the lack of strength in the yarn market. As a result, the near month fell by 0.15 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning, and the rest rose and fell by 0.05 yuan. It has been found that Changfeng sold 23,600 dan, Jinghua 5,500 dan, Jifeng 2,800 dan, Zhenda 2,500 dan, Renfeng 2,000 dan, Taichang 8,900 dan, Hengchang 2,200 dan, Tonghe 3,500 dan, Yichang 2,800 dan, Changji 1,100 dan, Meiji 1,200 dan, and Yongda 1,000 dan.

American Cotton Bulls Continuously Liquidating

Difficult to Rise Without New Stimulus

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with a weak trend, with prices falling by 11 to 19 points. Trading activity in the early morning was sluggish. However, due to unfavorable foreign news, domestic and foreign bulls liquidated. Labor disputes and Washington's opinions on goods were difficult to predict, so the market price fell. Fellow traders and short-sellers bought in a considerable amount. However, the bulls continued to liquidate. Judging from the current situation, new stimulus seems to be needed to rise. In Germany, trading was very smooth, spot cotton was quiet, and the cloth market was sluggish. The closing price was flat and weak, with spot falling by 23 points and futures falling by 19 to 23 points. English cotton spot fell by 16 points, and futures fell by 13 to 14 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to bull liquidation, then firmed due to broker purchases, and finally weakened again due to short-seller selling.

### Piece Goods

Rumors of Increased Unified Tax

Spot Cotton Cloth Becomes More Popular

Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, Dongpi white goods continued to be extremely firm and expensive. The demand from the northern routes of Tianjin and Jinan was still good. Approximately 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, both spot and futures, were traded, with the price increasing by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan per piece. The Four Gentlemen broadcloth produced by domestic and foreign factories increased by 0.005 yuan per yard due to the strong sales in the north. The Tianjin and Shanxi gangs purchased more than 120 boxes yesterday, and the market price was 0.2725 yuan per yard. Japanese merchants lacked spot fine cloth and fine twill, and were unwilling to sell futures. In addition, there were rumors that the unified tax would be increased, and large traders padded their stocks, waiting and watching, resulting in the spot market becoming more popular, especially Yanghe, Longtou, Wufu, and Sanpai. In terms of actual sales, except for the northern routes, the rest of the regions were not active, and the Sichuan gang was the most sluggish, so the sales of blue cloth from various factories were also the weakest.

Summer Woolens Already Being Prepared

The sales of woolens were still strong yesterday. Large-volume goods had less trade due to the lack of activity in the retail stores in this street. Western-style clothing was in great demand, and there were large transactions in the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes. However, due to the short spring season, buyers are purchasing summer goods early, and the market atmosphere has changed greatly. The sale of spring-season herringbone woolens and other types of wool with deep colors and slightly thick flannel has become sluggish. However, the sales of French flannel, wool serge, "Barker" wool cloth, "Paris Venting" yellow twill, and other items that are not yet in demand are very strong, which is very different from the situation in previous years. Yesterday, Ruiven "Paris" sold for 4.5 yuan, Shililuo wool "Barker" sold for 4 yuan, and American Chen French flannel sold for 5.25 yuan.

### Grains

Futures Flour Turns Stable After Falling

—Continuous Sharp Drop Triggers Short Covering—

Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of first falling and then stabilizing in each month. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago fell by 0.91 yuan, Canada fell by 1.12 yuan, and Liverpool fell by 1 penny. When the opening price was quoted, the market was extremely uncertain due to the reverse drop in foreign wheat. Therefore, the opening price of this month once fell as low as 0.81 yuan. However, the continuous sharp drop in recent days was too large. Therefore, short sellers covered their positions smoothly, and the market became firm. The price of this month rose step by step, rebounding by 0.3 yuan compared to the initial opening. The price of April also fell slightly at first and then rebounded. The weather in July and August has already cleared up, and the market is exhausted. By the time the afternoon session opened, the transaction of this month was not very smooth, and the market had stabilized. There was only a 0.1 yuan fluctuation in April. In July and August, the market became flat and weak due to new short sellers. It is estimated that there will be only four days of trading for this month in the market. Since actual sales are still quiet, it should pass quietly.

This Month's Wheat Recovers Well After Short Covering

Yesterday, the daily wheat market was generally calm in each month. Although the foreign wheat quotations rebounded sharply, the long and short sides gradually approached each other in the near term. As soon as the shorts entered this month, it rebounded by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan. There was no change in April. Before there is certainty about the new wheat in June and beyond, trading is naturally limited, so the fluctuation is also limited. By the time the afternoon session opened, this month was still stable at first. However, due to the slight improvement in the recent flour market, customers covered their short positions, so this month was again raised by 0.02 yuan. In June and beyond, the weather is fine, and the far-term flour is also weak, so it fell by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. In the spot wheat market, the standard has improved, and the prices of each grade have also increased by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. The price of Kaitiantai wheat was 6.22 yuan, Jiangsu wheat was 6.32 yuan, the second grade was 6.27 yuan, and Guangshui wheat was 6.09 yuan. A total of 6,000 to 7,000 bags were opened and purchased by Fuxin and Shenda.

Customers' Indica Rice Sales Become Sluggish

Customers' indica rice has arrived in recent days, still seeing 10,000 to 20,000 bags per day. Only because the Guangdong gang's consumption is extremely greedy, the market has gradually expanded. Yesterday, Guangdong's demand was weak, and the eating price was particularly tight. Most of the cargo owners were willing to sell, and the market immediately turned flat and weak. If the consumption tomorrow and the day after tomorrow is still weak, the market may have to step down somewhat. Yesterday, Guangdong gang transactions were less than 2,000 bags. The northern ocean and northwest routes were only more than 1,000 bags. The rest were purchased by this street. However, this street's appetite is not as lively as it was a few days ago because the customer sales are not strong. The daily open sales of Jiangxi rice were 8,800 bags, Hunan rice was 300 bags, and Wenyong rice was 630 bags.

River Rice Price in Northern Shanghai Slightly Recovers Due to Clear Weather

(Southern Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for each gang was the same as before, still only 3,300 to 3,400 shi of goods from the 15th and 16th. Among them, thin rice was from the 11th and 12th. Although the arrival of goods was rare, the local sales were particularly weak, resulting in a soft situation and a decline in the market. In addition to the fact that the price of thick japonica rice was secretly adjusted by a few points, early rice depreciated by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The thin rice was also because the purchase by the gangs was not satisfactory. Only the Xi'an gang handled 800 to 900 bags, and the purchase price was relatively large. The market also fell by a corner. Judging from the future trend, it seems difficult to gain a foothold. The supply and demand of Dujian and Yinyuan is similar, all flat.

(Northern Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various routes under the river was sparse, about the 12th and 13th. The sales of each goods in the market turned weak because the weather has turned clear. The store's appetite was loose, the market white japonica rice price turned a small 0.07 or 0.08 yuan, and the thin rice price was also soft.

However, the arrival of 100 yuan goods was scarce, and the zero appetite was still possible, and the price was good by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan.

Soybean Cake Sales Are Smooth

The soybean cake sales floor has continued to be strong in recent days, with South China being the main destination, and the mainland's intentions are also good.

The delivery period was set for about ten days, and the market was slightly higher than the previous market.

Standard Soybean Cake and Oil Still Depressed

Yesterday, the standard cake and soybean oil markets were still lifeless. Although the Dalian telegram saw continuous step-building, the sales in Shanghai were very sluggish. In particular, there was ample arrival and storage of soybeans, and both the car factories and customer gangs lacked interest. Most of the trading houses and customer merchants intended to sell the standard, but the filling and hoarding were sluggish. The near month of the opening market was immediately down 0.06 or 0.07 yuan, and the far month was down 0.04 yuan.

### Methods for Preparing Income Tax Return Forms (11)

— Pan Shihao, Pan Mingshan

(5) Report Form for Salary and Remuneration Income of Public Servants (with List)

Article 1 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that income from salaries and remuneration of public servants falls under the second category of income tax, which includes income from salaries and remuneration of public servants, freelancers, and others engaged in various occupations. All are taxed according to the tax rates stipulated in Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations. Therefore, in terms of the nature of the tax system, all salaries and remuneration, regardless of whether they come from public servants, freelancers, or others engaged in various occupations, are subject to income tax without any difference. However, in terms of the types of income earners and the withholding agents, there are differences. Also, there is a distinction when observing the source of tax revenue. Therefore, the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance has divided the income report forms and attached list formats stipulated for this type of income tax into three types: A, B, and C, as follows:

Type A: Report Form for Salary and Remuneration Income of Public Servants, Withholding List for Income Tax of Public Servants

Type B: Report Form for Salary and Remuneration Income of Freelancers and Others Engaged in Various Occupations (for Self-Payment)

(Note) This type of report form does not specify a list.

Type C: Report Form for Salary and Remuneration Income of Freelancers and Others Engaged in Various Occupations (for Withholding)

Withholding List for Income Tax of Freelancers and Others Engaged in Various Occupations

According to the above formats, public servants should use Type A report forms and lists for reporting and payment of their salary and remuneration income tax. This article explains the preparation method of this type of report form. As for Type B report forms and lists, due to the large number of inquiries from readers, their preparation methods have already been published starting from the 13th. In the summer of 1927, the Central Party Headquarters, due to the urgent need for funds for pensions for party members, created a system of income donations for service personnel, with the tax scope covering personnel of all agencies under the National Government whose monthly salaries exceeded 50 yuan. Those with 51 to 100 yuan were taxed at 1%. Those with 101 to 200 yuan were taxed at 2%. Thereafter, the tax rate increased by 1% for every 100 yuan increase in monthly salary, up to 8% for those with 701 yuan or more. Since the promulgation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementing Rules, income tax for public servants was first levied according to law from October 1, 1936. This income donation was then abolished. Therefore, in terms of the second category of income tax, public servants shouldered the burden earlier than freelancers and others engaged in various occupations.

According to Article 1 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for this category (i.e., Draft Collection Guidelines for the Second Category of Salary and Remuneration Income Tax), the scope of public servants is as follows:

1. Personnel of party departments at all levels and their affiliated agencies.

2. Personnel of central and local governments and their affiliated agencies.

3. Staff and teachers of national, provincial, municipal, and county schools.

4. Personnel of state-operated enterprises.

5. Personnel of local self-governing bodies.

6. Other personnel engaged in public service according to laws and regulations. (To be continued)

Children's Special

### "Shanghai Festival" and New Children

— Wei Ji

Little friends! Today, when this publication meets you, it happens to be the "Shanghai Festival" officially designated by all sectors of Shanghai! All the people of Shanghai are warmly celebrating and cheering!

Today, ten years ago, was when the National Revolutionary Army successfully completed the Northern Expedition and recovered Shanghai: we want to review the successes of the past and promote the glory of the past! Therefore, commemorating this "Shanghai Festival" has great significance! But we are not commemorating and celebrating for the happiness of Shanghai alone, but for the success of the revolution! For the hope of national unification and national rejuvenation! However, in these ten years, the country has experienced countless hardships, the territory has suffered endless trampling, and compatriots have endured displacement and suffering! Although the whole country has always adhered to the purpose of saving the country and worked hard to make determined struggles! However, so far, the revolution has only achieved a part! The lost land has not yet been recovered by an inch! What a sad and indignant thing that is!

Little friends! You are the new life of the country! The lifeline of the whole country is linked to every child! The maintenance of national affairs in the future depends on you, the recovery of lost land depends on you! The success of the revolution depends on you! The rejuvenation of the nation depends on you! You are the pillars of the country! You are the foundation of the nation! You are the future masters of the country! What a heavy responsibility you have! What a great mission you have! Arise! Roar! Children of the new China!

Let our entire Chinese nation warmly commemorate and celebrate it! Who is the creator of the "National Rejuvenation Festival"? It is the children of the new China!

Children of the new China! It's time! Arise! Roar!

### The Importance of Salt in National Defense

— Chen Jingjian

Little friends! Did you know? If modern warfare is to achieve final victory, it must have the great power of the masses and sharp new weapons. This is almost universally known. However, some people neglect the storage of wartime military supplies, which are extremely important to national defense, and this is very dangerous. Remember, wasn't one of the main reasons for Germany's failure in the European War of 1914 the internal economic panic?

Now, let me first talk about the things that are urgently needed in national defense, military affairs, and people's food: salt.

The chemical name of salt is sodium chloride, which is a daily physiological necessity for humans. Because it strengthens vitality and the heart, the body will become weak without it. A few years ago, when the Red Bandits occupied Jiangxi, the authorities' implementation of a salt blockade was also a major reason for their success. It can be seen that salt has a close relationship with military affairs. In peacetime, our country's salt is originally sufficient for consumption, but the export of Changlu salt to Japan has resulted in a situation where the interior still has a light diet, which is very painful. Moreover, now we have reached a critical period. If we do not store enough salt and a war breaks out, once the coastal provinces are occupied or blockaded by the enemy's huge navy, then the lack of salt is foreseeable. Why don't we store it up first?

Secondly, electrolyzing salt is the main raw material for manufacturing chlorine gas, mustard gas, phosgene, and other toxic gases - sodium and chlorine. Although we love peace and do not produce toxic gases to kill the enemy, we certainly cannot sit still and wait for death when the enemy uses toxic gases. If poison gas invades, the only disinfection method is bleaching powder, and the most important raw material for manufacturing it is chlorine, which is also a molecule of salt.

Another component of salt is sodium. According to Soviet scholars, sodium and oxygen combine violently with water vapor, and the heat generated allows sodium powder to be used as incendiary bombs. Therefore, salt is also an important thing in military affairs.

In summary, salt is an indispensable substance for national defense in critical times. We should now store it as much as possible to cope with enemy invasions. This is an urgent measure.

### Body Temperature

— Zhen

One day, Min'er was careless and caught a slight chill in the morning. At first, it was just a cold, but later she developed a fever, and her body temperature unconsciously increased a lot. Her brother Cong'er wanted to know exactly how high her temperature was, so he put a thermometer under her tongue (this thermometer is not a thermometer for measuring the weather, it is specially for measuring human body temperature). After about four or five minutes, he took it out and saw that it was much higher.

"Brother, how high is my temperature? What is the normal temperature for a person?"

"You have a fever of about two degrees. Sleep well. A normal person's body temperature is between 36.5 to 37 degrees Celsius or 97.7 to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. You are now over 39 degrees, aren't you more than two degrees hotter?"

"How is body temperature generated? Why is the normal body temperature a fixed number?"

"You need to know that the generation of body temperature is like wood burning, which can generate heat. This is all because nutrients undergo oxidation in the human body, which can also be said to be combustion, because combustion is a type of oxidation. Therefore, the warmth in the human body is emitted by the oxidation of body components. Since warmth is generated in the body, it must be dissipated, which is the same as a stove needing a chimney. But there are three ways to dissipate body temperature: (1) dissipated through the skin surface through the air, (2) dissipated directly through the skin surface without air as a medium, (3) dissipated along with the moisture on the skin surface and the water vapor in the exhaled air. Isn't the moisture on the skin surface sweat? Isn't the sweat that just came out of the skin warm? Isn't the water vapor I exhale from my mouth also warm? The emission of body temperature changes with the state of the body, and the dissipation of body temperature also differs depending on the state of the body and the cold, heat, dryness, and humidity of the air. But our body temperature can often maintain a certain degree because there is a body temperature regulating effect that can maintain the amount of body temperature generated and the amount of dissipation, which is in a state of equilibrium. Because of this regulatory effect, body temperature will not be too high or too low and can often maintain a certain degree. If body temperature is too high or too low, then you will get sick."

### Shanghai Festival and Shanghai Children

— Ba Ling

Today, March 21, is the "Shanghai Festival" designated by the Shanghai Municipal Government. In addition to warm celebrations throughout the city, various exhibitions are also being held to welcome the birth of the "Shanghai Festival." This indeed has profound significance and considerable value.

I remember Mayor Wu said at the Municipal Government Memorial Week last Monday: "We have established the Shanghai Festival with a very deep meaning, which is in line with the spirit of the times. We thought of using this Shanghai Festival to encourage industry, agriculture, commerce, and learning, to encourage citizens to be dedicated to their work, be gregarious, be loving, be united, help each other, cooperate, strive, produce, be lively, be optimistic, be progressive, and have upward-looking spirits and emotions, so that the entire Shanghai society and individuals will have a thriving atmosphere." These words are very sincere and worthy of our careful consideration.

We acknowledge that children are the roots of the nation and the future masters of the country, especially the children of Shanghai, who bear an even greater mission for the nation and the country. Therefore, on this Shanghai Festival commemoration day, all the children of Shanghai must deeply recognize that the Shanghai Festival is not an ordinary festival, nor is it a children's entertainment festival. The Shanghai Festival is the starting point for the children of Shanghai to begin diligently cultivating diligence in learning, love, unity, mutual assistance, cooperation, striving, production, liveliness, optimism, progress, upward-looking spirits, and virtues. So that the future Shanghai society can first establish a very solid foundation in the bodies of all the children in the city and gradually reach the realm of building a new Shanghai.

Children! Dear Shanghai children! I hope that from today's Shanghai Festival, you will accept the several excellent virtues indicated by Mayor Wu and strive to cultivate them. This is the true meaning of celebrating Shanghai.

### The Egg Can Stand Upright

— Cao Yiqiong

An oval egg can be made to stand upright! First, shake the egg vigorously to disperse the yolk and white. Then, use a bottle, any soda or beer bottle will do. Also, use two forks, insert them into a cork. However, one end of the cork must fit the tip of the egg. According to the picture, the egg can stand upright on the bottle cap. Be careful when playing this trick that the egg does not fall and break, because raw eggs will break when they touch a glass bottle or fall on the table.

Reason

This is because the yolk and white are heavier and sink to the bottom. Secondly, the two forks placed on top of the egg can balance the center of gravity. This is the same reason as a tumbler.

Distinguishing Raw and Cooked Eggs

Place four eggs on a plate, three raw and one cooked. Do not say in advance which one is cooked, so that people can distinguish between raw and cooked. This is originally very difficult. Now I have a method to teach you, which is to spin the four eggs one by one on the table with your hand. You can see that the one that spins very well is the cooked egg; the one that does not spin well is the raw egg.

Reason

The inside of a cooked egg is cooked and hardened, becoming a solid, so it can spin very well. The inside of a raw egg is liquid, so although the outer shell can spin, the liquid inside cannot spin at the same speed.

### Martial Games

— Liang Guangjing

After the New Year holiday, the school had the first semester exams. One afternoon, after handing in the exam papers, I walked along Green Willow Road, intending to find a sunny place to study. I happened to look up and saw seven or eight children fighting on the dirt pile in Jie Shou Park across the bank. They agreed that whoever fell would immediately stand up. Seeing this group of lively little angels, so innocent and lovely! I asked with concern: "How did you do on the exam?" They replied: "Not bad!" Then they affectionately asked me: "May I ask what your surname is, sir?" I said my surname was Liang. After walking a long distance, they all shouted in unison, "Mr. Liang!" From this, I have two insights:

(1) Being with children brings an indescribable joy in spirit! Therefore, primary school teachers are nobler than middle and university teachers! (2) Elementary school lower and middle-grade students should do martial games - who says Chinese people love peace? Look at the children's martial nature! However, parents and teachers forbid children from fighting to avoid damaging their clothes! You should know that cultivating children's martial spirit is more valuable than clothes! Parents and teachers who care about small profits affect the decline of the Chinese national character!

### Patriotic Thought of Turkish School Children

— Te

Turkish school children must sing twice a week, and the songs contain phrases such as "We are Turks" and "We are honest and hardworking." Every Monday and Saturday, which are the first and last days of the week, all schools hold flag-raising ceremonies, even schools that teach foreign children and children of ethnic minorities, such as Jews, Albanians, Greeks, etc., must also perform this ceremony. During the ceremony, all students stand around the flagpole on the playground. As soon as the Turkish national flag is raised, all students sing the Turkish national anthem. After the national anthem is sung, they sing a pledge song, the meaning of which is "We should protect those weaker than us, we should respect the elderly. We should love our homeland and our country more than ourselves. Progress can improve the country's knowledge level, and we should make this our goal. Our existence depends on the existence of the Turkish nation. We should sacrifice everything for the Turkish nation, and if necessary, we should also sacrifice our lives." After singing, they salute the national flag, and then they carry their schoolbags home.

### Reading

— Da Zhai

People cannot not read,

Nor can they read books to death;

Reading is originally for practical use,

Not just biting words and chewing phrases like bookworms;

We must find the source of life in books,

We must seek tools to save the country in books;

In addition to reading time, we must often go to nature to experience,

Go to nature to experience!

Go to nature to experience!

Verify and confirm what you have read in books.

### Kite

— (Yang Zhigang)

"Eat melon seeds in the first month,

Fly kites in the second month."

Kite is also known as Feng Zheng, commonly known as Yao Zi. February is the season for flying kites. In this gentle spring breeze and warm sunshine, it is a very interesting game to hold a kite in one hand.

According to the research of physiologists, flying kites is said to be very hygienic, no wonder so many celebrities are advocating it, holding a kite competition in the east and a kite competition in the west.

The inventor of the kite is said to be Han Xin during the Han Dynasty. At that time, Han Xin persuaded Chen Xi to rebel against Han, promising to respond internally when he raised his troops; because he wanted to dig an underground passage to the Weiyang Palace, he created the kite, wanting to fly it high to measure the distance to the Weiyang Palace. However, whether this legend is reliable is still a question.

### A Set of Small Furniture (Handicraft)

— Cheng

...Made with three yarn cores...

Little friends, does your mother or sister use yarn cores when sewing clothes? When the yarn is used up, there will be a piece of wood left with high ends and a recessed center. It can roll around on the ground and is very fun to play with. Now, please collect them and accumulate three, and you can make a set of exquisite and small furniture.

If you don't have yarn cores at home, then go to a nearby familiar tailor shop and ask for three. They will definitely give them to you.

Now that you have the yarn cores, let's start with the table, which is the simplest: just cut a circle out of thick paper and glue it to one end of the yarn core, like in picture (A). Isn't it a very good small round table?

The second is to make a vase, which requires colors and paintbrushes: use them to paint some nice things in the middle section of the yarn core, flowers and plants, or landscapes. Then pick some green grass and insert it into the small hole in the center, and you have a pair of adorable vases (picture B).

Finally, make a chair, which is a bit more difficult, but not very difficult. Cut the shape of a chair back out of thick paper and glue it to half of the yarn core, and the chair is successful. Then find a small piece of cloth and a little cotton. Stuff the cotton into the cloth and sew it up on all sides to make a comfortable cushion. Put the cushion against the back of the chair (picture C), and the whole set of furniture is complete. Naturally, it would be even more beautiful to paint a darker color on the white surface.

If you show these three pieces of furniture to your father, mother, and sister, your father will definitely like the chair, because he thinks: how comfortable it would be to sit on such a chair and read the newspaper. And your mother will definitely like the vase, she loves flowers as much as her life, and she thinks this vase is good. Your sister, however, likes to do "algebra" on such a smooth little table. How great!

It's a pity that these three things are too small.

### Linlin and Beibei

— By Xiaohui

(Explanation)

(1) Linlin and Beibei got lost while traveling in the countryside.

(2) A passerby said to them: Little friends! Come with me, I'll take you back.

(3) Linlin and Beibei followed that person.

(4) When they reached the beach, that person told Linlin and Beibei to get on the small boat.

### Arctic Explorers (2)

— Xi

The ship he boarded was a large, square-rigged brig called the "Progress." The route he took was directly through the Davis Strait. When passing the Danish colony of Greenland, they hired an Eskimo youth, half of whom had been educated, to specialize in hunting. They also acquired a team of dogs to pull sleds across the ice during exploration. The ship stopped in Renfan Bay. This location was west of Smith Sound, between latitudes 79 and 80 degrees. The date was only September 10, but the ice had already surrounded it, making it impossible for the ship to proceed. On November 7, the sun made its last appearance (in the Arctic region, there is sunshine for half a year, and darkness for the other half, so from July onwards, the sky gradually darkens). From then on, it was dark for as long as one hundred and forty-one days. During this dark period, "even the dogs felt pain, because they were used to lying under the hatch, enjoying that line of light, but now they couldn't see anything.

Before the sun disappeared, Dr. Gann hurriedly sent people out to hunt for various foods and other useful things. Taking advantage of the fact that the ice had not yet broken, he planned to set off with a snow army, hoping to find the route to Polynia, which leads to the Arctic Basin. He thought that Franklin might be trapped in the basin. In early spring, the sun returned, and when the first rays of light were discovered in the sky, they resumed their search. On March 18, a sled loaded with eight people set off in high spirits. On the 29th, near midnight, Dr. Gann and the others left on the ship were warmly lit in the cabin and sewed their soft leather shoes. Suddenly, they heard a sound of footsteps above. After a while, three people, with swollen faces and exhausted, walked down, unable to say a word. It turned out that four of their companions had frozen in the tent and could not move, and another brave Irishman, Thomas Hogan, volunteered to risk his life, stayed there to serve the four with food and drink, while the three of them hurried back for help. Just because the journey was so arduous and exhausted, they had no energy to speak.

Dr. Gann's first idea was of course to set off immediately to rescue his companions. So he set up a sled, brought a small tent and some dry meat cakes, everything was prepared. Of the three, only Urson was relatively strong, so he wrapped him in a fur bag, wrapped his legs in dog skin and duck down, and tied him to the sled with a leather strap, asking him to be a guide. At that time, there were a total of nine people, including Dr. Gann, who resolutely set off into the icy world in the severe cold of 78 degrees below freezing.

### How to Be a Strong Child

— Self-reliance

Children are the future masters of the country. To create a strong country in the future, we must first create strong children now.

Nurturing and development are different. Nurturing only counts as doing one's duty, and development counts as achieving results.

The roots of trees are deep and the branches and leaves can flourish, and the bones of children are strong and development can be sound, so the first thing to pay attention to in nurturing children is to strengthen children's bones.

The elements of strengthening bones are calcium and vitamin D, which are very much needed during the period of children's development. If there is no extra supplement, development will be incomplete, or diseases such as rickets and dental caries will occur.

How to supplement these two elements to children? Now there is a kind of "Jiale Calcium" chocolate candy. The taste is the same as ordinary chocolate, but it contains appropriate amounts of calcium and vitamin D. Children eat one or two pieces each time, and several times a day, which can make the bones and teeth develop well, and the body is strong, creating the masters of the strong country in the future. (Go to Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy "Jiale Calcium".)

### Fourteen Inches Versus Sixteen Inches

— Me

According to a London report yesterday, the Japanese government will reject the "fourteen-inch" main gun caliber stipulated in the 1936 London Naval Treaty. Naval sources claim that even if this news is true, the United Kingdom does not plan to make any changes in the next three years. The opposition is because fourteen inches is still considered insufficient, and they advocate for a sixteen-inch caliber to be truly satisfactory. Although there is only a two-inch difference between fourteen inches and sixteen inches, the increase in firing power and the magnitude of destructive power are vastly different. It's not like buying cloth at a store, where you can easily add two feet to one foot. It is extremely important in terms of naval combat.

Therefore, the question of quality arises, which then affects the question of quantity. The London Naval Treaty stipulates that battleships should not exceed 35,000 tons, but 35,000-ton battleships are only suitable for mounting fourteen-inch caliber guns. If sixteen-inch caliber guns are mounted, 45,000 tons would be required. Thus, not only is the fourteen-inch caliber opposed, but even the 35,000-ton battleships are overturned. Therefore, The Times commented that if the main gun caliber is raised from fourteen inches to sixteen inches, the impact will inevitably lead to a country using technical reasons as an excuse to increase the battleship tonnage to above 35,000 tons, and naval shipbuilding competition will never end. This is a natural trend and need not be elaborated upon.

In fact, simply put, it is impossible to limit the arms race among countries with a mere piece of paper. Assuming the treaty stipulates a 35,000-ton battleship, but in reality, a 45,000-ton or even a 55,000-ton battleship is built, what can the signatory countries do about it? Take a recent example, the Treaty of Versailles was of utmost importance, but now Germany's military has been rebuilt, and the national flag of the National Socialist Party is once again flying on the banks of the Rhine. What can be done about it?

In short, the world today is a world of force, a world of arms competition, a world without justice or humanity. So-called treaties and alliances are mostly tools to deceive people and are completely useless. Now, one can only assess one's own national strength and manufacture sophisticated weapons. As long as you have the ability and talent, you can build eighteen-inch or even twenty-inch caliber guns if you want, who would dare to question you? Therefore, it is reported that the United States government intends to propose a peace plan at an opportune moment, with arms reduction as the main point. This statement was recently denied by President Roosevelt because the United States likes to do peace and compromise work the most. President Roosevelt may have this kind of ideal, but in view of the current arms race reaching a fever pitch, such an idealistic proposal would only be laughed at as foolish or pedantic, so he could only deny it.

As for limiting arms and reducing arms, there is inherently no such thing in the world. In a militaristic country, its military strength is certainly better the stronger it is, and no other country can interfere, nor will it allow other countries to interfere. Even other non-ambitious countries, each country has its own national policy and its own necessary military preparedness, how can they be restricted? For example, in ancient China, weapons included broadswords weighing eighty-two catties and spears weighing fifty-two catties. It all depended on each person's skill and strength. It is impossible to restrict combatants to using only a certain weight of weapon. For me to use a spear of a certain weight and you to only be able to use a sword of a certain weight, this is both impossible in reality and unnecessary in the situation.

### Gleanings from a Country Stroll

— Jia Yi

Spring Suburbs

Dragging my weary mood, I left a corner of this tedious city and walked into another world. This accidental miracle was like a scene change on a silver screen.

Before my eyes was a field of lush green wheat seedlings, looking like a deep sea from the yellow soil; and when the cool spring breeze swept through, the verdant leaves gently swayed like ripples of green water, coming and going from afar, wave after wave.

Yellow wildflowers floated randomly. Although they have no fragrance and no alluring colors, they are enough to provide a pleasant touch to this vast expanse of green fields.

Full rivers and ponds, abundantly filled with spring water after the lingering rain, allow the willows by the river to reflect their graceful bodies, newly dressed in green-dotted spring attire. Several peach trees on the opposite bank, with budding blossoms, held a mouthful of smiles like young girls, perhaps thinking the willows were too charming! Yet, how could they know that the fallen petals behind them would be entrusted to the merciless flowing water!

What kind of food is falling from the clear sky! People only see that the withered land is now surging with the vigorous power of life. This power is infused into the veins of all creation, and invincible youth will break through the remaining power of winter, and the newborn universe expresses happiness as joy.

Although I did not see the swallows flying lightly, the spring scenery is too tempting with children holding kites in their hands.

Girls

Spring scenery is too tempting, stirring the souls of young girls. In the working fields, they even lengthen their own seedlings, and the weary work cannot restrain

## Page 21

this growing springtime heart. Their hearts, like willow catkins, flutter with the wind, who knows where they will land.

They are in groups of two or three, accompanied by women wrapped in headscarves, aged by life. Laborious and tired mothers have perhaps forgotten the springtime in their children's hearts! She shouts:

—Hurry up and watch, it will be late soon.

The girls gave a deep, lazy stretch, raising their weak arms, their arms were numb and about to collapse.

Those washing clothes by the river should be reflecting their rosy faces! When pairs of swimming fish swim past their eyes, this provocation is even more unbearable! ... But they only wish their father a good business tomorrow, bringing back a pair of fashionable shoe uppers…

From the tall chimneys that spew out blood-sucking black snakes day and night, a miserable sound howls. Yet another group has been released: some with pale yellow faces, others painted with urban extravagance – alarmingly colored red lips and powdered faces. Some have learned love songs from female students, others curse their fate like pear blossoms in the rain.

The youth of the country girls fades away before the spring scenery has ended! When female students wearing light spring dresses and their lovers walk past their eyes hand in hand, smiling.

Barren Graves

What are those piled up mounds? I can't help but think that they are barren graves!

On the bun-like clods of earth, no spring breath is evaporating. Only withered and broken grass stalks are sadly dying! Yet, the surroundings are all green! This division of life and death saddens me!

In these two worlds, who can say that is happiness? An old man who just walked to the barren grave, I saw him staring deeply at the grave with extremely sad eyes. This silent gaze is so poignant. He carried his heavy burden and finally walked away weakly.

The people in these barren graves, like their living descendants, spent their lives with the land. They painstakingly grew vegetables, picked clean every night, and carried them on their shoulders to the city every morning (at that time, the city people were having good dreams!). But the price they got could not buy their children a salted fish or a pair of socks!

The ancestors vented their anger on their children, whipping their livestock with willow branches; the children also retaliated on their own children in the same way. Work harmed the spring of their lives, and the land gnawed away their withered blood. When they leave with their hands empty, what they leave behind is still a piece of land that wears down life.

Successive generations of poverty, the fate of poverty. The accumulation of barren graves is increasing on the land! The land is their god of life, but also their fatal demon. Their process in the world is only to look up at the fiery lights on the horizon in front of the coffin-like hut on the nights they stop working, unfolding their comforting fantasies!

The old people are approaching their ancestors' graves, but the young people are stubbornly growing their youth. When the roar of the land boils, the sleeping people in the barren graves will see what a smiling face their descendants have!

### Memories Under the Bridge

— Harris

Last night I wandered on the lonely Sichuan Road Bridge. When I came back, I had a strange dream, as if I had returned to my distant hometown. I crossed the quaint Zhuxi Bridge, and I could see the door of my long-lost home.

It was like early morning, or perhaps dusk, everything around was hazy. My eyes, as a returning wanderer, were also hazy. But, I grew up in this countryside, and I will never forget that there are fertile fields, green hills, and gurgling streams here. How could I not recognize my peeling, bronze-colored door, and the red paper couplets on the door—the door was not bolted, and it opened with a creak as soon as I pushed it.

"Who is it? A frail and weak voice asked."

Oh, isn't that familiar voice my old grandmother's? She hobbled out, and who else could it be but my old grandmother with her kind and elderly face? She tried her best to open her old eyes and looked out the door… then my shadow appeared; I clearly saw her body stiffen… I hurried forward and opened my mouth to her with a trembling call, and then helped her into the house.

"Why didn't you send a letter first… I was wondering why I hadn't heard from you for so long! Your return is so sudden! Oh, let me see, you left home at thirty-one, and now it's been a full nine years. Thank God! You've become so strong and tall, just like your father… Good, you sit here, let me light the lamp." Muttering all the way, we went to the hall together. My old grandmother struck a match, but it was immediately blown out by the wind. So she struck a second match and then lit the lamp with an extremely trembling hand. Under the yellow firelight, I gazed wistfully at my old grandmother; and I was surrounded by a noble warmth. My old grandmother finally smiled and said, "Thank God, you've grown up so well!"

"Where's Aunt?" I asked. Because I felt lonely.

"She went to the city to see your cousin's illness. She probably won't be back tonight. Have you had dinner? Let me cook you some dinner!"

Grandmother was too old, I said, and I really wanted to see Uncle Qing next door at the moment, maybe I'll eat there

Uncle Qing's house was on the other side of the bridge, and it took less than ten minutes to get there. With the same shock, this honest middle-aged man received me. But I was surprised to meet Uncle Qing's daughter, Ah Hui, here; wasn't it said that she had already married and become a mother? This beautiful childhood companion.

Dinner was eaten at Uncle Qing's house. Fearing that it was too late, and I was really a bit tired, I said goodbye and came out. There was a rustling mountain breeze and insects chirping in the fields. The moonlight in the sky was very clear; but the water in Zhuxi was even clearer. When I leaned on the bridge railing and looked at the water, what I saw was the gurgling water; flowing, flowing, reminding me that the water I saw here in my childhood was also flowing like this.

And my childhood was like flowing water, I don't know where it flowed to! What was left was this memory on the bridge.

In the memories under the bridge, there was Ah Hui with two braids. When we were young, we climbed hills all day long, ran in the fields, and watched the flowing water on the bridge. When we got a little older and understood some of the ways of the world, I once asked her:

"Hui, what are you thinking about?"

"I'm thinking that the water keeps flowing, and our childhood will one day flow away; what will we do then?"

I was embarrassed at the time and didn't answer; and now, nine years later, the reality has given the most cruel answer: Ah Hui is already someone else's wife, the mother of two children, and I am a single man wandering around the world.

This incomprehensible life!

When I woke up from the dream, it made me even more painfully aware that I was still staying on a strange sea, and I hadn't even returned to my hometown once—my wandering life has been going on for nearly ten years

### Aftersound

The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (1300) will have Mr. Lu Zhixue of Wuzhou Pharmacy lecture on "The Relationship Between Sulfuric Acid Industry and National Defense and Chemical Industry" from 6:40 PM to 7:00 PM today. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention at that time.

The "Song of Spring", a world-famous song published at the end of last month in the "Chinese Harmonica World, Volume 3, Issue in the Famous Song Column" of the Chinese Harmonica World Monthly Magazine, 157 Anren Street, Xinbeimen, this city, was composed by F. Mendelssohn and adapted into a harmonica piece by the famous Chinese harmonica expert Bao Mingshan. Since the publication of this song, it has been enthusiastically welcomed by readers from all over the country, who have sent letters and telegrams to the magazine requesting Mr. Bao to personally teach the various playing methods and expressions, strengths, weaknesses, and musical terms of the song on the radio. Mr. Bao, unable to refuse the enthusiasm, has agreed to broadcast on the Youlian Radio Station (frequency 880) from 5:40 PM tomorrow (Monday). In addition, at the request of listeners who love harmonica music from business and academic circles outside the city, the director of the Wenlian Radio Station has specially agreed with Mr. Bao to change the teaching time from 4:10 PM to 4:30 PM every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon to 5:40 PM to 6:00 PM from tomorrow. Please pay special attention to the readers who love harmonica music so that they can listen and study on time.

The Lingying Opera Troupe is a newly emerging group specializing in singing majestic songs. Since broadcasting, it has received good reviews from the outside world. Now, in order to expand its operations, the troupe is recruiting several female members and a violinist (both male and female are accepted, and those who can volunteer are qualified). Those who are interested in joining the troupe can write to the Lingying Opera Troupe, 876 Zhoujiazui Road, Hongkou.

### Hardworking Proofreader and Field Reporter Zhao Dan's Performance in "Crossroads"

Old Zhao is an unemployed intellectual. He lives in a corner of the city, in a simple and dirty apartment, and still owes the landlord several months of rent. His life is so difficult that he can't continue, and his heart is very anxious to find a job and survive. He runs around outside every day, but in the current situation where there are more people than jobs, selling one's intellect is still not an easy task.

As a result, one morning, he received a letter from the postman, which brought him good news. He has a job. He is a proofreader in a newspaper. Although the remuneration is so meager and the position is so low, it is still a great opportunity for him. From then on, his life may be a little more stable.

He happily ran to the newspaper. Although the work was so busy, he only focused on doing it. Whenever he had free time, he also studied writing articles. By chance, the editor-in-chief discovered his writing talent and assigned him to be a feature writer and field reporter. Holding two positions, he was really too busy to breathe, but he still worked desperately. He ignored the ridicule of his colleagues. His answer was:

"I won't die anyway. I think it's always better to have something to do than nothing, and it's always better to have food to eat than nothing..."

Friends! What a painful statement. For the sake of "living," we have to work. How about you?

### The "1939 Drama Society"

### Will Stage "Sunrise"

The script has been approved by the Social Bureau

Xia Xia, Mei Xi, and Sun Jingjun Participate

The "1937" newly emerging drama society, born with the 1937 drama year, has been preparing for a long time. Originally, they planned to stage Mr. Ling He's "Black Hell" as the script for their first performance, but later, because the play failed to pass the review twice, it was temporarily put on hold; on the other hand, they immediately submitted Mr. Cao Yu's "Sunrise" for inspection, while working hard on the play's technical aspects.

Two days ago, not only did the complete four-act script pass, but the actors were all talented people on the stage. Such as Xia Xia, Mei Xi, Gao Buxiao, Sun Jing, Manna... etc., and the role of Little Thing in "Sunrise" has also found considerable talent to play it, who is Shu Xiuwen's sister, Shu Na.

Director? The first is of course Zuo Ming; at the same time, they need more people to direct them. With such a wealth of talent, the theater is about to explode again!

### Grand Theater Presents "Adorable Wildcat"

New Production Starring Child Star Shirley Temple

Shirley Temple's acting can be considered among the best of the Hollywood child stars. Her previous works have been very popular and have garnered much praise. Now, her latest masterpiece, "Adorable Wildcat" (The Little Colonel), is being shown at the Grand Theater. In the film, Shirley Temple plays an innocent and mischievous young lady who repeatedly causes trouble within the Navy Department, making the Admiral dizzy and causing the entire crew of sailors to laugh until their teeth hurt! However, she inadvertently uncovers a spy's plot and performs a remarkable feat for the Navy Department. The content is both serious and humorous, with songs and dances, and it can truly be considered Shirley Temple's unprecedented masterpiece.
