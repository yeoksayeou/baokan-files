### Important Meetings Held by Both Chinese and Japanese Sides in Beiping and Tianjin Last Night

A Pivot for Deciding the Tension in the Northern Situation: The Japanese Side Declares Troop Withdrawal Will Occur After the Overall Situation is Stabilized; Japanese Troops Arrive at Langfang and Fire Machine Guns as a Show of Force

[Beiping] On the evening of the 25th, Song Zheyuan convened a meeting of important figures from Hebei and Chahar at the Jinde Society. Zhang Zizhong rushed to participate, and the meeting had not yet adjourned late into the night. Important discussions were held regarding the current situation, corresponding remotely to the meeting held by the Tianjin Japanese military headquarters on the 25th. They are equally important.

[Beiping] A certain related source stated that most of the Japanese troops in the Da Jing Village, Da Wayao, Wulidian, and Shagang areas have not been withdrawn. Only a small portion has been rotated for defense. Our troops have successively retreated as agreed. The defensive area left by the 37th Division has been taken over by Zhao Dengyu's 132nd Division. Now, the Japanese side is strongly claiming that the number of troops taking over from Zhao's division is greater than the original defense force, and they have suddenly raised a protest. Upon investigation, it is clear that this move by the Japanese side is an attempt to delay the date of troop withdrawal. Their intentions are profound. Temporary peace at the moment is by no means long-lasting, and the future is predicted to be quite pessimistic. (Central News Agency telegram on the 25th)

The overall situation in North China is still in a serious state. There has been no development in the overall situation between China and Japan, and no diplomatic talks have taken place. The authorities in Hebei and Chahar are currently mediating. The central government has great confidence in Mr. Song, and Mr. Song will definitely be able to maintain his past spirit of persevering through difficulties and meet the expectations of the central government.

### Four Japanese Military Attaches Stationed in North China

— One Hidden Person

Japan's policy towards China has historically emphasized two approaches: "internal division" and "military intimidation." These two methods have been quite effective since their implementation, especially the first, which is the most effective. Because this bloodless method not only reduces scrutiny from other countries, but also requires no military force, it can be achieved easily. The method of division involves sending so-called "military attaches," "chiefs of special service organs," and other elements who exploit the weaknesses of Chinese traitors. The brief biographies of the four military attaches currently stationed in North China are detailed below:

㊀ Kiyotomo Katsuki, aged fifty-seven, from Saga Prefecture, is a key figure in the Saga faction of the army. He is stubborn and headstrong. He graduated from the 14th class of the Military Academy, two years later than Army Minister Sugiyama. Initially, he was just a platoon leader with the rank of second lieutenant. After the Russo-Japanese War, he was promoted to lieutenant and later assigned as a military attache to the Japanese Embassy in Germany. Before long, he was promoted to adjutant in the Ministry of the Army, section chief in the Education General Directorate, and chief of the Army's Military Affairs Section, thus ranking among the young and hawkish faction, considered the orthodox faction within the army. He was then promoted to commander of the 30th Brigade. Four years ago, he was promoted to major general and transferred to the position of Commandant of the Infantry School. Not long after, he was promoted to commander of the 12th Division. After the February 26th Incident, he was unexpectedly promoted to commander of the Konoe Division. When Senjuro Hayashi formed his cabinet and Kōtarō Nakamura became Army Minister, Katsuki suddenly jumped to become the head of the Education General Directorate. When Tashiro became seriously ill, it was very difficult for the Ministry of the Army to find a successor. Army Minister Sugiyama recalled that during the Jinan Incident in 1928, Katsuki was the chief of the Army's Military Affairs Section. He came up with a plan to urgently transfer a large force from the Kwantung Army's Outayama brigade to Shandong. However, within the Ministry of the Army, Matsumoto's regiment within the Outayama brigade was unwilling to move. Katsuki, only a colonel, engaged in a fierce debate within the Ministry with those who opposed it. Katsuki strongly argued that "the opportunity for achievement should not be missed," and strongly encouraged the regiment to seize the opportunity to send troops to Shandong. As a result, the soldiers of the Matsumoto regiment were greatly moved, and Katsuki's proposal was implemented. Thus, his reputation grew day by day. Why? Because the Northern Expeditionary Army reached Jinan and was blocked by the Japanese army, thus opening the precedent of using force to suppress China. And the brains of their military headquarters became even more reckless after this. When the incident ended and rewards were distributed, five members of the Matsumoto regiment received the Order of the Golden Kite, considered the most glorious achievement since the Russo-Japanese War. Two of them were those who most forcefully attacked the northwest corner of Jinan City. And Katsuki, because his proposal was victorious, was praised by the military headquarters. He became arrogant and exceptionally pleased. From then on, his career flourished greatly, rising to the commander of the 30th Brigade, from brigade commander to division commander. This time, when the Lugouqiao Incident erupted, Army Minister Sugiyama recalled Katsuki's proposal to block the Central Army during the Jinan Incident. After consulting with the army's top leaders, they decided that the most suitable person for the job was him. After receiving the order, he rushed from Tachikawa Airfield to Tianjin by plane and took office. As soon as he arrived in Tianjin, he treated the Chinese people as enemies and issued a so-called "Japanese Army Pacification Proclamation." Later, he issued a tough statement towards China, repeating the old trick of the Jinan Incident, telegraphing for a large army to come to China and forcing the Jicha authorities into a treaty under duress. Looking at it this way, no matter how much China endures and desires peace, hoping to prevent the situation from escalating, it is unlikely to be allowed in reality. Why? He advocated using force against China even when he was in Japan. Now that he has come to China, if he does not achieve aggressive achievements, how could he possibly stop there?

㊁ Heisuke Hashimoto, aged fifty-two, from Hiroshima Prefecture, is a mid-level member of the radical faction within the Army advocating aggression towards China. He graduated from the 20th class of the Military Academy in the cavalry department. He is outwardly gentle but inwardly tough, comparable to Doihara. He served as a military attache at the Japanese Embassy in France, after which he was transferred to the Staff Headquarters, instructor at the Field Artillery School, commander of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment, and chief of the Staff Headquarters section. Due to the Nagata Incident, he resigned to take responsibility. Unexpectedly, misfortune turned into fortune, and he was promoted to commander of the Chinkai Fortress. Last year, he was promoted to major general and became the leader of the fascist-leaning Greater Japan Youth Party, and was assigned as the chief of staff of the North China Garrison Army. He thought his opportunity had arrived and began to play his game of using aggression against China as a tool, engaging in extensive activities in Tianjin and Beiping. It is said that he took advantage of the Lugouqiao Incident to contact Tianjin traitor groups such as the "Greater Asia Association" and the "Puan Association" in an attempt to launch an autonomous movement against anti-Japanese elements and the 29th Army of the Jicha Political Affairs Committee. His intention was to first make Tianjin and Beiping special, and then gradually encroach on other neighboring provinces. He disagreed with Tashiro, finding Tashiro's methods too weak and believing that Tashiro's talent was not sufficient to cope with the North China environment. Now that Tashiro is dead and Katsuki has arrived, it naturally suits his taste. Therefore, the future situation in North China, if not forming a third puppet organization, they are probably unwilling to give up. Moreover, his luck-seeking mentality is even greater than Doihara's.

㊂ Taijiro Matsui, Colonel, aged fifty-one, from Fukuoka Prefecture, graduated from the 22nd class of the Military Academy. He secretly operated in Vladivostok and various parts of Siberia. Because he was detected by the Russian army, he committed a major espionage crime and was arrested and imprisoned. The Russian army originally wanted to execute him, but after Japanese diplomatic negotiations, he was imprisoned for three months and deported. While in prison, he learned Russian from Russian prisoners. After returning to Japan, he was selected to serve as a member of the Staff Headquarters, a member of the Army Ministry's Press Section, a staff officer of the Kwantung Army, commander of the Osaka Regimental District, and commander of the Manchurian Garrison, highly valued by the Kwantung Army. In March of this year, he was appointed as the chief of the Beiping Special Service Organ. The Jicha Political Affairs Committee, for the convenience of negotiating with the Japanese army, also hired him as an advisor. Thus, he was like a fish in water, shouldering a special mission, and began to play his favorite tricks of dividing the internal affairs of North China and absorbing pro-Japanese elements, and provoking the relationship between the central government and North China, often traveling between Tianjin, Tongzhou, and Beiping, wanting to realize his ideal of "specializing North China" and expanding the Jidong puppet organization.

Imao Takeo, Major, aged forty, from Nagano Prefecture, graduated from the 30th class of the Military Academy. After graduating, he immediately entered the China Section of the Staff Headquarters, specializing in the study of Chinese affairs. He was selected to serve as a military attache in various parts of China. He is even more familiar with the situation in the Guangdong and Guangxi areas, and his footprints have covered almost all of Guangdong. He served as the chief of the Fengtian Special Service Organ and is currently an assistant military attache at the Japanese Embassy in Beiping. This person is very cunning and leaves no stone unturned in his manipulation of China. He speaks Chinese and considers himself a "China expert." He often uses clever words and flattering expressions when negotiating with the Jicha authorities, gaining the trust of some pro-Japanese elements. Looking at the above four people as a whole, they all regard aggression against China as the only tool for promotion and advancement, stubbornly going their own way, and have not yet recognized the unity within China and the strength of national psychology. They are accustomed to using divisive tactics. Then, the relationship between China and Japan, I fear, will be like the relationship between Germany and France, with hatred deepening. The author recalls that when Takashi Fuse, a commentary member of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun, came to China last year, he said to local Japanese reporters, "The constant disputes between China and Japan are all due to a group of military attaches stirring up trouble. If China and Japan truly want to be friendly, they should urgently withdraw all the military attaches back to Japan..." This sentence is truly a clear and correct view of China.

### Russian Newspapers Observe the Situation in North China

Japanese Military's Challenge Actions. The Result of the German-Japanese Agreement.

[Moscow] Soviet newspapers recently commented on the dispute between China and Japan, all believing that the situation is extremely serious, not only for the Soviet Union, but also for the whole world.

The Moscow Daily News stated, "The occurrence of this dispute near Lugouqiao, Fengtai, and Beiping is not accidental. The reason why Japan chose this place as the area for its offensive is that these places are the intersection of the main railways in North China. If they can be occupied, troops can be transported to Chahar via the Ping-Sui Railway to deal with the growing anti-Japanese movement in Chahar Province. Not only that, Japan also hopes to control the entire North China, in order to open up the road for Japanese imperialism to invade northwestern and central China, and Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union are also its targets."

The Moscow Evening News stated that North China's wheat production accounts for 55% of the total in China, cotton accounts for 65%, wool accounts for 92%, coal accounts for 52%, iron ore accounts for 60%, and the length of railway lines accounts for 46% of the total in the country. The population is about 100 million. Once North China is lost, China will economically become an agricultural country dependent on Japan. It will feel a lack of coal and iron, the industry will have no hope of development, and independence will naturally become a problem. It is found that the latest Japanese challenge to China is the result of the military agreement between Germany and Japan. Japan is currently negotiating with Britain to divide spheres of influence in China, so it has taken this action to pressure Britain, creating a fait accompli that North China will completely succumb to Japan, and placing it before Britain. As for National Socialist Germany, it wants to take this opportunity to shift Britain's attention, so that Germany can act completely freely in Spain without any scruples." The conclusion is that "After the Shenyang Incident, Japan seized the entire Manchuria within seven days, but in North China, even though dozens of incidents have occurred, it has only managed to establish the Jidong anti-communist puppet organization after two years of hard work, which only shows that its efforts are diminishing."

### Record of Hearing the Appeal Case of the Yang Assassination

Hankou Correspondence: The appeal case of the Yang Yongtai assassination case was heard by the Hubei High Court yesterday morning. The defendant, Liu Lu Yin, had already submitted a petition to the Supreme Court for transfer of jurisdiction. According to regulations, the trial should be temporarily suspended. Therefore, he was not brought in for questioning. Meanwhile, the defendant, Ji Baizhou, also submitted a petition to the Supreme Court on the 21st, requesting transfer of jurisdiction. Therefore, Ji was also not brought in for questioning. When the court convened yesterday morning, the interior and exterior of the High Court were heavily guarded by military police. Dozens of onlookers were present, and all were subjected to two rounds of searches by military police before entering. At 8:30 AM, Xiong Shichang, presiding judge of the High Court's Criminal Division I, judges Hu Shitao and Yu Jianxun, clerk Ye Huixia, and prosecutor Lang Dechang took their seats in the First Criminal Court and declared the trial open. Defendants Cheng Xiechao and Cao Bingrong were assigned defense lawyer Hu Sijiang. Defendant Li Qunjian was assigned defense lawyer Xiao Buyun. Defendant Yang Qixin retained defense lawyer Li Guojiao. Defendant Wen Maoguan retained defense lawyer Lu Jihui. Yang Yongtai's family's private prosecutor's representative, lawyer Xie Shengkan, and sub-agent lawyer Huang Can, also arrived in court one after another. Yang Qixin's father, Yang Chunfu, in the capacity of a legal assistant, was also permitted by the court to attend the trial. Then, presiding judge Xiong Shichang signed the order to bring defendants Cheng Xiechao, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Li Qunjian, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan to the court. Cheng's leg shackles had been removed, and his attitude was particularly calm. Li Qunjian and Wen Maoguan were emaciated and severely ill. They were escorted into the court by bailiffs. After all the defendants were present, presiding judge Xiong Shichang asked Cheng Xiechao, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, and Nie Jingquan about their age, place of origin, address, and occupation. After this formality, he stated that because the defendants Liu Luyin and Ji Baizhou had petitioned the Supreme Court for transfer of jurisdiction, it was unknown whether the case would be tried by this court. This matter would be determined only after the Supreme Court made a ruling. However, today's investigative hearing was exploratory in nature. He hoped to gain a clearer understanding of the facts of the case. He urged them to answer all questions truthfully and without concealment.

Cheng Xiechao's Testimony

Immediately afterwards, the interrogation began. (Judge asked) Cheng Xiechao, do you know Yang Erqian, also known as Yang Xiaoming? (Cheng answered) Yes. (Judge asked) Where and when did you join the assassination organization? (Cheng answered) I joined in Hankou Hotel last September. (Judge asked) Yang Erqian and Fan Qishu, did you both meet them? (Cheng answered) Yes. (Judge asked) Do you know someone named Liu Luyin? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) What is the structure of the Anti-Japanese Elimination of Traitors Group? Do you know? (Cheng answered) No. You say you joined an assassination organization, didn't Yang Erqian and Fan Qishu tell you about the organization's details when you joined? (Cheng answered) Fan Qishu was my superior when I was in the army. He told me that the Anti-Japanese Elimination of Traitors was specifically for resisting the violent Japanese and eliminating traitors. I was a soldier and of course supported such an organization, so I joined. However, only a month passed between joining and the assassination of Chairman Yang. In this short period of time, they certainly wouldn't tell me the detailed inside information. (Judge asked) When did you arrive in Hankou last year? (Cheng answered) Around July or August. (Judge asked) Who instigated the assassination of Yang Yongtai? (Cheng answered) Yang Xiaoming. (Judge asked) Do you know Liang Jiubao? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) How did you previously confess that after seeing Chairman Yang's photo, Ji Baizhou, Liang Jiubao, and you went to Wuchang to scout Chairman Yang's whereabouts? (Cheng answered) … (Judge asked) How many times did you go to Wuchang to scout Chairman Yang's whereabouts, and where did you scout? (Cheng answered) Three times, at Sandaogai and the Provincial Party Headquarters in Wuchang. (Judge asked) When did you assassinate Chairman Yang in front of Jianghan Customs? (Cheng answered) Around 2 or 3 PM on October 25th last year. (Judge asked) How many people were present when Chairman Yang was assassinated? (Cheng answered) Ji Baizhou and I. (Judge asked) Where did the handgun used for the assassination come from? (Cheng answered) Yang Xiaoming gave it to me. (Judge asked) Was Yang Xiaoming still in Hankou on October 25th last year? (Cheng answered) Yes, but I don't know where in Hankou he was. At this point, Cheng gave a very detailed account of the assassination that day. (Judge asked) Was Cao Bingrong present when you assassinated Chairman Yang? (Cheng answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) Are Cao Bingrong and you in the same assassination group? (Cheng answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) How did you previously confess that Cao Bingrong was standing somewhere as a marker? Was Cao Bingrong present or not? Tell the truth. (Cheng answered) I ran into Cao Bingrong around 1 or 2 PM that day. I don't know if he was present during the assassination. (Judge asked) Did you fire two shots when you assassinated Chairman Yang? (Cheng answered) Yes, I fired two shots, and Xiong Baizhou fired one. (Judge asked) Since Chairman Yang only had two gunshot wounds, did you hit him with both shots, or did you hit him with one shot and Xiong Baizhou hit him with one shot? (Cheng answered) I hit him with both shots. (Judge asked) How far away was Xiong Baizhou standing from you? (Cheng answered) He was standing by the iron railing, about three or four feet away from me. (Judge asked) You previously confessed that Yang Xiaoming told you and Xiong Baizhou to do something. What was it? It was said in code, referring to assassinating Chairman Yang. Cao Bingrong was also present at the time and did not avoid it. Is this true? (Cheng answered) Yes. (Judge asked) Do you know that Yang Xiaoming used aliases such as Xu Chao and Xu Qun? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) Have you seen the Special Agent Team plan drafted by Yang Xiaoming under the alias Xu Qun? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) Do you know that the Special Agent Team plan was endorsed with the words "Monthly allocation of two thousand yuan to be sent by Ru Yun"? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) How much money did you receive each month for joining the assassination organization, and who gave it to you? (Cheng answered) Yang Xiaoming gave it to me, saying it was eighty yuan from Fan Qishu, but I only used thirty-odd yuan of it. (Judge asked) If you had the opportunity to escape after the assassination, would you have had travel expenses? Who would have given them to you? (Cheng answered) Yang Xiaoming.

Cao Bingrong's Testimony

Next, Cao Bingrong was interrogated. (Judge asked) Do you know Yang Erqian? (Cao answered) No. (Judge asked) Did you join an assassination organization? (Cao answered) No, I don't know anything about assassination organizations. (Judge asked) If you don't know anything, why did you previously say that on October 25th last year, you and someone else found out in Wuchang that Chairman Yang was going to Hankou, and then went to the Xintai'an Inn to listen to Cheng Xiechao's assassination? (Cao answered) No, that's just how I answered whatever the judge asked because I was afraid of being tortured. (Judge asked) Where were you when Chairman Yang was assassinated? Were you really acting as a lookout in front of Jianghan Customs? (Cao answered) No. At this point, the judge stated, "Cao Bingrong, you must know that the court of first instance has already sentenced you to life imprisonment. You have now appealed to this court, hoping to seek relief according to the law. Therefore, this court is paying special attention to your and Cheng Xiechao's cases. However, you must answer my questions honestly. If you conceal the truth, it will be harmful to yourself." (Judge asked) Do you often go to the Xintai'an Inn in Hankou? (Cao answered) Yes, because there are fellow villagers living there. (Judge asked) Did Xiong Baizhou and Cheng Xiechao have handguns? (Cao answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) Did you just hear me ask Cheng Xiechao about Yang Xiaoming telling Cheng Xiechao and Xiong Baizhou to do something? What was it? It was said in code, referring to assassinating Chairman Yang. Cao Bingrong was also present at the time and did not avoid it. If you didn't join the assassination organization, how could they not have avoided you? (Cao answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) Didn't you confess in the Capital Police Department that you were acting as a lookout when Cheng Xiechao and Xiong Baizhou assassinated Chairman Yang? Why are you denying it now? (Cao answered) I confessed in the Capital Police Department because I couldn't bear the torture.

Yang Qixin's Testimony

Next, Yang Qixin was interrogated. (Judge asked) When and where did you join the assassination organization? (Yang answered) I didn't. (Judge asked) What is your relationship with Yang Xiaoming? (Yang answered) He is a cousin who is no longer in mourning. (Judge asked) You confessed in the Capital Police Department that your group leader was Yang Xiaoming, is that right? (Yang answered) That was said under duress. (Judge asked) You once said that the highest leader in your organization was surnamed Liu. Who exactly is he? (Yang answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) Is the person surnamed Liu Liu Luyin? (Yang answered) I don't know. The judge stated, "Yang Qixin, you are very young. You have submitted written statements expressing remorse several times in prison. Now, you refuse to confess anything. This shows that you are not sincere in your remorse. You must be clear-headed and tell the truth." (Judge asked) Didn't you say that your organization was a union of frustrated military personnel, with the first step being to assassinate Chairman Yang, and then to assassinate ministers Zhang, Jiang, Yu, and Chairman Chiang, is that right? (Yang answered) … (Judge asked) You also said that you were responsible for communications and for investigating the movements of Minister Zhang and others in the capital, is that right? (Yang answered) I didn't join the organization and didn't take on any work. (Judge asked) Did you and Xiong Baizhou really scout Chairman Chiang's movements? (Yang answered) No. (Judge asked) Did you go to Lushan? (Yang answered) I did go there… (Judge asked) Did you know about the assassination of Chairman Yang? (Yang answered) I didn't know. (Judge asked) What is your father's name? (Yang answered) Yang Chunfu.

Yang Chunfu's Testimony

Next, Yang Chunfu was interrogated. (Judge asked) How old are you? (Yang answered) Forty-eight years old. (Judge asked) Where are you from? (Yang answered) Xingren, Guizhou. (Judge asked) Where do you live now? (Yang answered) Doujiying, Wuchang. (Judge asked) What did you do before? (Yang answered) I have always served in the academic world. (Judge asked) What is Yang Qixin to you? (Yang answered) He is my son. (Judge asked) When was Yang Qixin born? (Yang answered) On the second day of the twelfth month of the Wuwu year in the Chinese zodiac. (Judge asked) Do you have any statements to make today? (Yang answered) I have a written opinion to present. Everything I want to say is inside. My son is young and ignorant and was tempted by others to violate the law. I hope the court will show leniency and give him a lighter sentence.

Nie Jingquan's Testimony

Next, Nie Jingquan was interrogated. (Judge asked) Do you know Wen Maoguan and Fan Qishu? (Nie answered) Yes. (Judge asked) How did you get to know Fan Qishu? (Nie answered) I am a doctor. Fan Qishu was introduced to me and came to me for injections three times, so I got to know him. Later, he said he wanted to buy a handgun and asked me to introduce him to someone. (Judge asked) What country manufactured the gun that you introduced Fan Qishu to buy? (Nie answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) When you introduced Fan Qishu to buy the gun, did you know that he was going to use it to kill someone? (Nie answered) I didn't know.

Li Qunjian's Testimony

Next, Li Qunjian was interrogated. (Judge asked) Are you Yang Erqian's adopted son? (Li answered) Yes. (Judge asked) When did you come to Hankou last year? (Li answered) I left Shanghai on October 7th and arrived in Hankou on October 22nd. (Judge asked) What did you come to Hankou to do? (Li answered) Yang Erqian's family didn't have money, so he asked me to come to Hankou to get money from Yang Erqian. (Judge asked) Yang Qixin said that you were responsible for communications at Yang Erqian's house, is that right? (Li answered) No. (Judge asked) Why did Yang Qixin say that? (Li answered) Yang Qixin is here now. If he says I was responsible for communications, tell him to produce proof. (Judge asked) What illness are you suffering from now? (Li answered) I have alternating chills and fever. The doctor said it's very dangerous. He cried incessantly.

Wen Maoguan's Testimony

Finally, Wen Maoguan was interrogated. (Judge asked) Did you work in the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters before? (Wen answered) I worked as a temporary member of the Investigation Section of the Garrison Headquarters. (Judge asked) Was it detective work? (Wen answered) Yes, but I was just helping people. (Judge asked) The court of first instance ruled that your case was not admissible. You appealed to this court because you didn't want to be tried by a military tribunal. Regarding your identity, the court of first instance sent an official letter to the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters to investigate, and the result was that you were an extra probationary warrant officer in the Investigation Section, is that right? (Wen answered) …

Lawyers' Statements

After the interrogation was completed, the court asked lawyer Huang Can, the sub-agent of the private prosecutor's representative of Yang's family, and the prosecutor if they had any comments. Huang and others replied that they had no comments. Next, Li Guojiao, defense lawyer for Nie Jingquan, Xiao Buyun, defense lawyer for Li Qunjian, and Lu Jihui, defense lawyer for Wen Maoguan, made statements one after another. Finally, Cheng Xiechao made some statements about the motives for the assassination. At 10:30 AM, the court adjourned. The bailiffs escorted the defendants back to custody. Yang Qixin cried to his father, asking for help. Cheng Xiechao did not want to return to the detention center and was persuaded by several bailiffs to return to custody. (Reporter's note: The confessions recorded in this article are based on what was heard in the audience. There may be discrepancies with the court records. The official court records shall prevail.)

(And the "secretary" of the "attached village" must also possess: ㊀ Have a passion for upholding fairness and justice," ㊁ Be able to mobilize people under the age of 38 in the "attached village".) (D) The selection criteria for the so-called "group leader" are: ㊀ "Be able to be trained by the group leader," ㊁ "Be able to lead a small group to uphold fairness." (E) The selection criteria for the so-called "instructor" are: ㊀ "Have a clear understanding of the "regiment's goals"," ㊁ "And be able to enthusiastically support it." (F) The qualifications for the so-called "group member" are: ㊀ "Being in the village," ㊂ "Being between the ages of 18 and 38," ㊂ Not having any of the following circumstances: (A) "Having acts of corruption and bribery," B) "Smoking opium," (C "Being disobedient and unfilial")"Having been criminally punished," (D) "E" Being an idler with no regular employment."

According to the above organizational system and conditions, there are now 105 "county regiment headquarters," 1,424 "district regiment headquarters," 11,151 "village regiment combinations," 190,281 "small groups," and 1,009,094 "regiment members" in the entire province of Shanxi.

Second, the Mission and Task of the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Corps" - What exactly is the mission of such a large, political mass organization? I have asked many Shanxi people, and their answer is: "Unite the good people and uphold fairness and justice." This is a very general answer. To be more specific, it is: "Unite the good people, punish the bad people, eliminate social injustice, establish social fairness, eliminate the communist scourge, and strengthen the country and save the nation." Especially the latter two points, I think, can be used to divide its establishment into two periods: "Eliminating the communist scourge" is the main mission of its first period; "Strengthening the country and saving the nation" is the mission of its second period. Therefore, in its 25th and 16th degrees of work, the item "Assisting in reporting traitors" is specifically stipulated. As long as a "regiment member" reports to the "village regiment headquarters" and the county government verifies it, they can receive a reward of 100 yuan. The fifth verse of the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Song" says: "Upholding fairness and justice, the first thing is to sacrifice, sacrifice can achieve great benevolence, someone is a traitor, colluding with the enemy, execute them, execute them, show no mercy." These are clear evidence of its emphasis on "strengthening the country and saving the nation."

Its specific tasks roughly include the following: ㊀ "Reporting officials for violating the law and neglecting their duties," ㊁ "Reporting unscrupulous gentry and local bullies for taking advantage, being unreasonable, and behaving unfairly," ㊂ Preventing the Communist Party from turning the villages red," ㊃ "Persuading idlers and bad elements who do not engage in honest work to turn over a new leaf," ㊄ "Supporting all administrative matters in the village that benefit the people and eliminate abuses."

We can perhaps say that it is a mass organization with a very strong political nature. Its task is to "organize the masses and train the masses," using collective power to clarify political darkness and eliminate social injustice; its mission is to prevent communism internally and resist the country's enemies externally. And at its root, it is still about upholding what they call "fairness and justice."

Third, Its Work. The Shanxi authorities say that the most successful aspect of the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Corps" in the past two years has been reporting violations: from May to September of the 25th year, in four months, a total of 5,607 cases were reported. The people who were reported included not only senior officials but also county magistrates, judges, prison wardens, public security chiefs, inspectors, district chiefs, and anti-communist defense chiefs, etc. There were reprimands, demerits, dismissals, and even executions. However, these are only passive efforts to clean up the officialdom. If viewed from the standpoint of a mass movement, I believe that the greatest achievement is in the area of "organization." Just imagine, in Shanxi, a society full of ancient customs, it was possible to organize 1,009,094 people in just two years. This is truly an extraordinary feat! The next most successful aspect of its work, I think, is "propaganda." When I was in Shanxi, I saw slogans and Spring Festival couplets created by the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Corps" everywhere. In theaters, cinemas, and other public places, there were often propagandists speaking about "upholding fairness and justice." They repeated "Upholding Fairness and Justice" with great enthusiasm in the Shanxi dialect. Once, I bought a bag of candy, and when I opened the paper bag, a piece of paper flew out. On it was printed: "Punish bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people," "Support good officials, good gentry, and good people," and a horizontal inscription with four characters: "Upholding Fairness and Justice." This propaganda can truly be called "all-pervasive!"

Its work in the 25th year was divided into "daily" and "assistance" sections. There were six types of daily work: ㊀ organization, ㊁ training, ㊂ mutual assistance, ㊃ mutual evaluation, ㊄ reporting, ㊅ propaganda. There were four types of work to assist other agencies: ㊀ assisting in reporting traitors, ㊁ assisting in promoting local goods, ㊂ assisting in banning opium and drugs, ㊃ assisting in training young people and women (temporarily absent in the 25th year). One pilot project: "Corps members delivering and receiving documents." The work in the 26th year can be divided into ten items: ㊀ selection, ㊁ training, ㊂ mutual assistance, ㊃ mutual evaluation, ㊄ reporting, ㊅ propaganda, ㊆ assisting in reporting traitors, ㊇ assisting in promoting local goods, ㊈ assisting in banning opium and drugs, ㊉ assisting in training the people. Plus one item: "Corps members delivering and receiving documents." Compared with the 25th year, there are two differences: ㊀ The first work in the 25th year, "organization," has been cancelled in the 26th year and changed to "selection." Because in terms of organization, it has already expanded to more than one million people, which is almost all the able-bodied men in Shanxi Province between the ages of 18 and 38, there is no need to do more organization work; the current work is naturally to select cadres. Moreover, in this year, the "group leader" is also elected by the "group members" instead of being approved by the village regiment leader. ㊁ The work of assisting in training the people has officially begun. In accordance with the regulations of the National Government, it is divided into three items: A able-bodied men training, B youth training, and C women's training. Among them, the women's training item is organized by the "People's Training Committee" of each village, and the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Corps" assists it.

### The Greatest Effort Has Been Made for Peace

— Yi

In the past few days, our country's military and political authorities have made the greatest effort for East Asian peace. However, the invading troops are still entering the pass in a steady stream, intending to permanently occupy our Hebei territory. According to yesterday's Beijing telegraph, not only did the Japanese troops east of Wanping City not withdraw, but they also occupied the highlands of Shagang Village as an artillery position, forcibly conscripting our farmers in the area to dig long communication trenches reaching Fengtai. This action proves that Japan has no sincerity in the so-called troop withdrawal negotiations a few days ago, and our unilateral implementation of troop withdrawal is simply another trap. Even so, we believe that the heroic soldiers on the front line will not be discouraged by this. When the invaders challenge again, they will definitely be able to inflict a fatal blow on the invaders with the support of the people across the country.

The expanded all-out war at that time would be even more tragic to imagine. However, since the Japanese side has shown such an attitude, we will not vainly hope to avoid this tragedy. Since the September 18th Incident, the speeches and actions of our central and local military and political authorities have shown the world that China loves peace and is determined not to seek war. Even after the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, our country's authorities' painstaking efforts to maintain peace were witnessed by the world. However, the invaders disregarded world opinion and insisted on using means that would destroy peace to dominate our great nation with thousands of years of history. How can we continue to endure and compromise? Therefore, the four points of Chairman Chiang's presentation of our country's position on the Lugou Bridge Incident greatly inspired the 450 million soldiers and civilians across the country. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, we are now prepared to make the final sacrifice to defend our country's territory and sovereignty.

We believe that this kind of national determination has great significance. Because historical facts show that the revival of a nation is mostly through a baptism of blood. At this moment when the gunpowder keg in the Far East has already caught fire, it is clear that only the Japanese imperialists can withdraw the sparks they have thrown to prevent the world's human race from suffering a major explosion. However, we feel that this hope is very slim.

### Romania Inquires with Britain About Organizing Anti-Communist Front

British Attitude is Cold; Polish Spies Discovered on Russian Border

[London] It is generally known that Romanian King Carol II, when he inquired here the other day, proposed that Poland and Romania organize an ideological "epidemic prevention line" to prevent Bolshevism from spreading to European countries, and inquired with British politicians about this matter, but the British attitude was extremely cold, and the policy of organizing any kind of ideological group was opposed by Britain, (Havas News on the 24th).

[Moscow] The government recently issued a bulletin stating that on the 5th of this month, two people were discovered in front of the Slavik Ziek border defense post on the Soviet-Polish border, entering Russian territory from Poland, and firing at a team of Russian border guards. After the border guards opened fire and retaliated, the two people were shot and killed. Various pieces of evidence and documents for engaging in espionage were found on their bodies, proving that one of them was Polish border guard Lieutenant Cirofsky. The Soviet government has instructed its ambassador to Poland to protest to the Polish government (Havas News on the 24th via Central News Agency).

### The Bessarabian Sovereignty Question

Russian Newspaper Raises Old Issues, Urging Romania to Reflect

Rome - Romania's Bessarabia Province, originally Soviet Russian territory, was only recognized as Romanian after the European War in 1920 by the Five-Power Ambassadorial Conference. The Soviet Union has never explicitly recognized it. The Soviet "Pravda" newspaper yesterday, because Romania's political orientation has recently seemed to please Poland over the past few months, raised the issue of Bessarabian sovereignty again to urge Romania to reflect. The "Business Daily," a radical socialist party newspaper, commented: Regarding the cession of Bessarabia Province to Romania, the Soviet government only indirectly and temporarily recognized it. In 1934, Romania's former Foreign Minister Titulescu, in London, requested Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov to jointly issue a statement, saying that the province is currently under the administration of the Romanian authorities and can be considered to belong to Romania. There are actually nuances here. It seems that Romania's foreign policy is more advantageous if it is close to the Soviet Union; otherwise, the question of the province's sovereignty will inevitably be raised again. At this moment, Romanian King Carol II has already engaged with German leader Hitler and plans to host German Aviation Minister Göring after returning to his country. "Pravda's" re-raising of the province's sovereignty issue will naturally have a considerable effect. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)

### German-Puppet Economic Collusion

French Newspaper Reveals Inside Story

◎Translated by Wai Lun She, Published in the Beijing Daily: According to reliable sources, a manager of a certain German trading company in "Manchukuo," named Knoerl, is said to be a representative of Germany's three major steel manufacturers. Knoerl, with the status of a Taipan (chief manager) of a German trading company, after arriving in Changchun, immediately began negotiations with the "Manchukuo" authorities for a loan. It is said that the German side is willing to assist "Manchukuo's" industrial construction plan with economic power. It is reported that the amount of this loan is 100 million Manchukuo Yuan, "exclusively for" the purpose of "Manchukuo's" industrial construction. It is also said that this loan is only of a short-term nature, as Germany is also currently experiencing poverty.

The conditions of this loan that can be made public include two items, the contents of which are as follows:

Article 1: The total amount of the loan is 100 million "Manchukuo" national currency, provided by related German trading companies doing business in Manchuria. The repayment period is set at six years.

Article 2: With respect to this loan amount, the "Manchukuo" authorities can order machinery, etc., from Germany without having to pay in cash, but it should be guaranteed by the Japanese government. The negotiations regarding this credit loan were held in Changchun in early July. As for the parties involved in the negotiations, in addition to the "Manchukuo" authorities and representatives of the three German trading companies, representatives of the Kwantung Army also participated, as some of the construction is quite related to military national defense. According to general observation, this German-Manchurian loan agreement was actually initiated by the Japanese side, because the Japanese side needs German assistance in carrying out its five-year construction plan in "Manchukuo." According to news from the Tokyo newspaper in Japan, Japan originally planned to negotiate a loan with the British side, just as Britain did to China, and apply it to "Manchukuo." However, the British side politely declined the request, as the negotiations between Britain and Japan in London had not yet been completed. Having no other choice, Japan turned to Germany for negotiations, and because Japan and Germany have a relationship of the Anti-Comintern Pact, it succeeded once negotiations were held. However, in order to avoid stimulating Chinese sentiment, it was changed to German merchants in Manchuria coming forward. It is now reported that the detailed items of the loan treaty are being negotiated by the Japanese, German, and Manchurian sides.

### Explosion at Yugoslavian Armory

Cause of Death and Injury to People and Animals Unknown

Yugoslav Capital - Forty-five tons of gunpowder suddenly exploded today at the military depot in Kragujevac, killing at least five people and injuring more than forty. Hundreds of cattle, horses, sheep, and other livestock nearby were killed or injured by the explosion. A local factory and residential buildings were destroyed by the fire, which also spread to nearby forests. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital - After an explosion occurred at a chemical plant in Kragujevac, the town is now guarded by troops. It is reported that there were no deaths. Another report stated that one person was killed and several were injured, and several houses were also destroyed by the explosion. The town is a center for the manufacture of military supplies. The authorities are now conducting strict censorship of news to prevent conflicting reports. At the same time, the army authorities have also begun investigating the truth of the explosion.

### German Workers' Income Increases

▲Haitong News Agency, Berlin Dispatch - According to the National Trust Bureau's report, the total income of all German people in 1936 was 61,500,000,000 marks, of which the income from salaries and wages was approximately 35,000,000,000 marks, an increase of 2,500,000,000 marks compared to the previous year. This increase is not due to the increase in labor prices, but due to the increase in the number of workers and the extension of working hours. In terms of quantity, there were a total of 18,000,000 workers in 1936, which is even more than the 17,870,000 in 1929. In terms of working hours, the average daily working hours per person in 1935 was 7.41 hours, while in 1936 it was 7.66 hours. Last November, it was further extended to 7.8 hours. This year, due to the implementation of the Four-Year Plan, there will inevitably be a greater need for extension. German workers who work more than 48 hours per week must have their wages increased by 25% above the normal rate, so the result is one of the reasons for the general income. In addition, the increase in senior workers and the establishment of disability insurance are also reasons for increasing income. The stability of salaries and wages in Germany indirectly prevents the rise in prices. From November 1935 to November 1936, the German cost of living index increased very slightly, only from 121.9 to 124.3.

### Another Black Person Sentenced in the Case of Insulting White Women

Sentenced to 75 Years in Prison

Tuscaloosa, USA - The case of a black man raping a white woman, which shocked the world, has now come to a devastating end. There were a total of eight defendants in the case. Two had already been sentenced. Today, another person named Wim was sentenced to 75 years in prison. The other five had their lawsuits withdrawn by Alabama. According to the case, two homeless white women were in a freight car near Scottsboro and were raped by black men. Several white men in the car were also beaten and insulted. During previous trials, radical groups in the country mostly claimed that the treatment of black people was unfair, so the state government also included black people in the jury. This is a pioneering initiative in Alabama since the North-South conflicts. (24th)

### The Fall of Brunete, the Northwestern Bulwark of Madrid

Gains and Losses Affect the Overall Situation of the War, the Rebel Offensive is Irresistible, Two Strong Government Brigades Completely Annihilated

Navalcarnero Dispatch - Special dispatch from Havas News Agency reporter, Brunete Town, on the northwestern outskirts of the capital, was captured by the Nationalists yesterday. The most advanced were three cavalry teams, who furiously shot at the defenders amidst the flying dust and charged into the town's main streets. Previously, twelve squadrons of Nationalist aircraft had bombed the Government troops' positions in the town. The Government troops' aircraft were unable to resist due to their small numbers. The column led by Nationalist Central Route Commander General Varela broke through the Government troops' lines under the cover of aircraft. However, the Government troops still fought hard to resist with cannons and mechanical weapons. The Nationalists then launched a second attack and entered the town around noon. The Government troops then retreated in a panic. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)

Navalcarnero Dispatch - Special dispatch from Havas News Agency reporter, it is heard that in recent days, more than two thousand soldiers of the Government troops on the central front have been captured. All of them are poorly clothed, exhausted, and have been taken in and accommodated by the Nationalist authorities in designated detention areas. In addition, it is heard that two of the Government's most combat-capable brigades have been almost completely annihilated. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)

Madrid - Brunete Town, on the northwestern outskirts of the capital, is a strategically important location. Its gains and losses are sufficient to determine the outcome of the Madrid battle, so the two sides fought fiercely for it. It has been gained and lost countless times. As of the time of dispatch, the town has been completely recaptured by the Government troops. The battle yesterday was very fierce. The Nationalists first used cannons and aircraft to bombard the Government troops' positions in the morning, and then bravely advanced. By noon, they had occupied many of the houses in the city. However, the Government troops were unwilling to show weakness and immediately launched a fierce counterattack, driving back the Nationalists. The battle resumed in the afternoon. Under the cover of cannons and a large number of tanks, the Nationalists again charged towards the town, pursuing the Government troops and abandoning the town. The Government troops stationed in the town were the 11th and 14th Division troops, and they immediately withdrew safely, regrouped outside the village, and took a roundabout route. They re-entered the town in the evening and street fighting immediately broke out. The two sides engaged in close combat, and the Spanish Moroccan indigenous troops belonging to the Nationalists also arrived at this time to join the battle. By late at night, the Nationalists could not hold out and retreated. However, it is generally believed that the Nationalists will launch another attack. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)

Madrid - The two sides are still fighting fiercely on the Brunete Town front on the northwestern outskirts of the capital. The Nationalists have assembled a large number of troops and military supplies there, including a large team of Moroccan indigenous soldiers and many tanks. They launched a fierce attack on the Government troops' positions in the afternoon. The Government troops also fiercely resisted. For a time, cannons and aircraft dropped bombs and bombed, and the battlefield was raining bullets. However, Brunete Town has always been in the hands of the Government troops. Later, because the cannons used by the Nationalists had a larger caliber, the Government troops were forced to retreat slightly. Until the evening, the Nationalists continued to attack, trying to estimate Brunete Town, because the town is located at the intersection of the Estrada Madura Province and the Avila Province, and it is a place that the Nationalists must fight for. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)

Madrid - The Madrid government announced today that Brunete Town, which the government troops and rebels have been fighting over for a long time, is located sixteen miles west of the city. The rebels have now been defeated, abandoning many corpses and war equipment. According to news from Seville, the Nationalist army used tanks as a vanguard to attack the town. Military experts believe that the gains and losses of the town are related to the overall situation of the civil war. Judging from the news on the government side, at least for now, the government troops seem to have the upper hand. Today, there was also a major air battle in Madrid. The sound of anti-aircraft guns firing was continuous. The rebels used forty trimotor German aircraft and dozens of fighter planes to attack. According to a government report, they have been repelled. (24th, National Electricity)

### British Attempt New Efforts on the Spanish Issue

The Non-Intervention Conference Convenes Today to Comprehensively Discuss a Compromise Plan

[London] - Britain will soon make new efforts to resolve the deadlock in the non-intervention plan. After consultations between Foreign Secretary Eden and representatives from Germany and France, it is expected that the sub-committee will convene a meeting on Monday to discuss new proposals for the British compromise plan. It is said that the British compromise avoids the procedure of discussing the proposals in order, and replaces it with a comprehensive question, distributed to representatives of various countries, for them to fill in one by one. And because of the interconnected relationship between the proposals, it is specifically stated that the questions are a whole question, and the order of the proposals in the original plan book and the current comprehensive question is not important. In this way, the true attitude of various governments towards various issues can be clearly obtained. It is also heard that the ambassadors of Germany and France have given preliminary agreement to the above-mentioned compromise. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters dispatch)

London - German Ambassador Ribbentrop held talks today with the Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Lord Plymouth, Chairman of the Adjustment Committee. According to diplomatic sources, Ribbentrop expressed to Plymouth that the British government intends to submit a table of questions to the countries concerned, asking them to answer each item listed in the British compromise plan one by one. Germany believes that this British suggestion will allow the negotiations that have been suspended to continue. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas dispatch)

### King Leopold's Suggestion of Sympathy from All Countries

The United States Believes it is Timely, Germany Seeks Equal Economic Rights

[Washington] - Secretary of State Hull said today that King Leopold of Belgium's suggestion to establish a permanent non-political institution to study economics and promote world peace is very timely, and that the current international relations rely more on a solid economic basis. However, Mr. Hull did not want to express whether the United States will participate in this organization in the future. (24th, National Electricity)

[Washington] - Regarding the letter from Belgian Leopold III to the country's Prime Minister Celan, suggesting the establishment of a permanent International Bureau for Economic Research, Secretary of State Hull recently expressed his opinion, saying that he supports various institutions that can make the opinions of politicians from various countries on international economics more clear. He will support all organizations of this nature. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas dispatch)

[Berlin] - After King Leopold of Belgium suggested the establishment of an international economic research institution, people in political circles here expressed satisfaction, saying that people around German leader Hitler have repeatedly requested that Germany should obtain equal rights in economics. If an international economic research institution is established, it will be especially beneficial to Germany's request. In addition, the German General Report said, "This kind of research institution should directly apply to the three countries of England, France, and the United States, asking them to pay attention to the two issues of raw material distribution and payment methods. Germany hopes that this kind of application can be understood by the three countries of England, France, and the United States." (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas dispatch)

Brussels - After King Leopold III sent a letter to Prime Minister Celan, suggesting the establishment of a permanent international economic research institution, all the evening newspapers here carried long articles to comment on it. One of the evening newspapers said, "Since the Great War, our country has been making continuous efforts in the international arena to remedy the economic turmoil. The King's letter to Prime Minister Celan is a new stage of this effort. The scope of the Belgian mission (referring to Prime Minister Celan being entrusted by the British and French governments to investigate the world's economic situation) is so broad that it cannot be measured by numbers. In short, it is nothing more than wanting to make people in various countries believe that normal and effective economic cooperation is possible. If normal and effective economic cooperation cannot be established, then the world situation will have no possibility of being saved." In addition, the socialist "People's Daily" said, "Regarding the issue of mutual cooperation between the nationalities of various countries, whether it is economic or governmental, the head of state and the government have expressed their enthusiasm. As for the King's letter this time, it recognizes that economic issues and various political events are all interconnected. It means that economic cooperation and political cooperation should be planned and considered together. We deeply hope that the world can understand this, because economic cooperation, if it is only beneficial to a part of the country, and this part of the country not only destroys freedom and rights within the country, but also wants to threaten other international countries, then there is no international cooperation to speak of. This is obvious." Also, some people in political circles rumored that Prime Minister Celan was about to step down, so the King and the Prime Minister agreed that the King would send a letter to the Prime Minister, asking him to serve as the director of the International Economic Research Bureau in the future, so that Celan could save face when he leaves office. However, the last paragraph of the People's Daily's article strongly denies this and believes that it is completely inaccurate. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas dispatch)

### Investigation of Foreign Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War

The Ratio of Personnel is Four to One, Government Officers Mostly Foreigners

According to a military investigation in Paris, there are a total of 80,000 foreign volunteers in the Spanish rebel army, and only 20,000 in the government army. If the volunteers are completely withdrawn, the government army will suffer extremely heavy losses, because General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army, can ensure that the original Spanish army is not affected, while in the government army, officers above the rank of platoon leader are all volunteers, and very few natives can drive tanks, use machine guns, or fly airplanes.

### Traitors Active in Henan and Shaanxi

Secretly Surveying Terrain and Spying on Military Intelligence, Colluding with Bandits to Disrupt Security

Zhengzhou Dispatch: After the Lugouqiao Incident, there have been many foreigners and traitors traveling to the inland areas of Henan and Shaanxi. In addition to secretly surveying the terrain and spying on military intelligence, they are also tasked with colluding with bandits to instigate riots. Therefore, recently, bandit leaders Cui Erdan and Li Molin have sent representatives to Zhengzhou to contact certain parties. The original traitors in Zhengzhou are also preparing to disrupt the local area and sabotage transportation by force. The authorities have convened many security meetings for days in a row, decided on prevention measures, and strictly implemented them, so the traitors have not dared to take any action. Several staff members and family members of the Japanese Consulate in Zhengzhou recently went to Hankou under the leadership of Matsui Masutaro to prepare to return to their country. However, the person in charge of the Japanese Consulate expressed that they would not leave Zhengzhou for the time being, as they are intensifying their activities and work.

Also, the traitor Yu Shaoxiang brought a camera from Tianjin to various places in Henan and Shaanxi to secretly photograph the terrain of fortresses. He was arrested and interrogated by the police station branch station in Xuchang on the 20th. (July 22nd)

### Wuhu Rice Merchants Decide to Prevent Rice From Aiding the Enemy

Hereafter, Rice Purchases in Anhui from Hebei Must Be Certified by the Local Chamber of Commerce

Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu's status as a rice market is due to it being a gathering place for rice rather than a rice-producing region. Therefore, market conditions generally shift based on supply and demand. Those who manage and procure rice in Wuhu traditionally come from the Guangdong, Chaozhou, Yantai, and Ningbo groups. In recent years, the Guangdong and Chaozhou groups have been affected by the domestic sale of foreign rice, leaving the Yantai (Tianjin) group as the sole major outlet market. According to rice industry statistics, over 800,000 shi of white rice and over 500,000 shi of wheat have been shipped this year. Corn amounts to 200,000 shi, and broad beans and silkworm beans exceed 100,000 shi. The sales channels for the aforementioned wheat and miscellaneous grains, in addition to Yantai and Tianjin, also include Qingdao and Tangshan. These are mostly collected by Japanese trading companies and the so-called "Procurement and Transportation Guild" here. Last month, business was particularly brisk. Even after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred and the Shanghai Customs began an embargo, the Wuhu industry still declared that they had not seen a clear order from Wuhu and tried to operate at risk. Only after learning that the Tianjin Merchants Storage was forcibly occupied by enemy troops did things gradually become quiet. Those who had already completed their transactions stored their goods in warehouses or used bank drafts to obtain working capital. Recently, in light of the domestic situation, another meeting of all rice industry committee members was convened. They resolved to prevent the enemy from using traitors to come to Wuhu for procurement under false pretenses, which would be equivalent to directly supplying the enemy with grain. However, in order to consider the daily food needs of compatriots in North China, it was decided that from now on, those coming to Wuhu from North China to purchase rice must have a letter of certification from the local Chamber of Commerce before procurement and transportation would be permitted. At the same time, various circles in the Suzhou area are organizing an anti-enemy support association, which is also paying close attention to the large-scale export of Anhui rice to North China and intends to implement effective auditing. As a result, although the rice and wheat market conditions have inevitably been slightly sluggish recently, purchases of relief rice by various parties in Wuhu and the rush of flour mills in Shanghai and Zhenjiang to collect wheat in Wuhu offset each other nicely, and market prices have remained stable. Currently, top-grade machine-milled rice sells for 9.4 yuan, brown rice for 8.4 yuan, and wheat ranges from 8.1 yuan to 8.45 yuan. (23rd)

### Random Notes on Rural Hubei

— Cheng Jun

General Situation of Rural Huanggang

Huanggang's rural production is mainly rice, wheat, cotton, and miscellaneous grains. The third district is rich in tobacco leaves, which generated approximately 2 million yuan in national currency in sales to various places last year. The Xinzhou area produces cotton, reaching 150,000 dan (piculs) per year, with each dan worth approximately 40 yuan. It is a pity that cultivation methods are not improved, resulting in the production of mostly coarse cotton. Otherwise, the sales value would be even greater. Other products such as bundled hemp and indigo produced along the river, and the wheat crops of Luohuo and Yadan, are also very abundant, which can be said to fully utilize the land. However, forests are often damaged by wildfires and theft, leaving bare mountains everywhere, which is a pity. It is necessary to promote afforestation and prohibit destruction.

Farmland is measured at 2.5 dou (pecks) or 60 square zhang (units of length) per mu (unit of area), which varies from place to place. The land tax and surcharges per mu are approximately five to six jiao (fractions of a yuan). The relationship between landowners and tenants is divided into two types: "tizhuang" and "yongdian". "Tizhuang" land is wholly owned by the landlord, who temporarily leases it to tenant farmers for cultivation. The landlord collects grain once or several times a year, based on the tenant's lease agreement. If the tenant is in arrears or short on grain payment, the landlord can freely take back the land and recruit another tenant. "Yongdian," on the other hand, involves the tenant paying a lump sum fee and only paying rent grain once a year. The landlord has no right to take back the land and lease it to another tenant. In terms of produce, farmers should be able to provide for themselves, but unfortunately, due to consecutive years of floods and droughts, crop yields have decreased, and prices have fallen. The burden of taxes and levies is too heavy, and corrupt gentry and local bullies add insult to injury. In this environment, the rural economy is inevitably headed for bankruptcy, just like other counties.

Banditry has also been rampant in recent years, and local order cannot be maintained. Prosperous families have long since moved to the cities, making the rural areas even more difficult. Usury has emerged in response. Farmers borrow money at monthly interest rates as high as four or five fen (cents) or even one jiao. Pawnshops, five or six in number, offer slightly lower interest rates, but the appraised value is too low, and the redemption period is too short. Farmers have nothing to pawn other than their clothes and bedding. Fortunately, since 1934, the Hubei Provincial Bank Cooperative Committee, under Liu Wei, has designated this county as one of the counties to promote cooperative undertakings and has established a rural cooperative guidance office. Local farmers were initially skeptical but gradually became trusting. There are now 117 formal cooperatives and 7 federations. The Farmers Bank of China is responsible for providing loans. In the past year, loans to formal cooperatives totaled 38,411 yuan, and 1,000 yuan to preparatory cooperatives.

Education is ostensibly quite developed. There is a provincial Huangzhou Junior High School, and Cangzibu has the private Zhengyuan Middle School, which was founded with donations from Xu Yuanquan. There are a total of five complete primary schools, a central primary school in Tuanfeng, and more than ten private elementary schools. Unfortunately, most of them are in the cities, which is inevitably uneven. The joint defense primary schools exist in name only. Although they have been reorganized recently and have improved compared to before, the salaries are too low, and teachers cannot settle down and serve. The number of literate farmers in the county is only about 15 percent. Popularizing social education is urgent.

### Baoshan

Strengthening Firefighting Equipment

The firefighting efforts in this county have been well-managed, but due to funding issues, equipment has not been adequately strengthened. Now, the authorities believe that firefighting is extremely important during this extraordinary period and have decided to strictly supervise various rescue organizations to thoroughly reorganize existing fire engines. At the same time, they are raising large sums of money to purchase new firefighting equipment to meet needs.

### Kunshan

Discovery of Two Male Corpses

In the river southeast of Beiqingdun Village, Wusong Port, this county, an unidentified male corpse was discovered on the 23rd. The village chief of the township retrieved the corpse, which was approximately thirty years old, had a knife wound on its back, was bare-chested, and wore black suit pants. The village chief has reported this to the local police station and requested the county to examine the body. In addition, a male corpse surfaced in the river near Xiaoshu, west of Wusong Port, yesterday morning. It was approximately twenty years old, wearing a white cloth short shirt and black pants, resembling a farmer. The Lujiabang police station has dispatched officers to investigate and locate the deceased's family members to come forward to identify and prepare the coffin.

### Jiangyin

Rampant Outbreak of Plague in Zhouzhuang

In Zhouzhuang Township, the second district, true cholera has recently broken out, spreading rapidly through the villages. It initially affected mostly children, with more than twenty deaths. Now it has spread to the young and strong. The township health branch is trying to eradicate it, but the epidemic is very severe, with dozens of deaths per day.

Robbery of Shop in Sanguan Township

Hu Yongtao, a resident of Sanguan Township outside the east gate, runs a sundries store. On the night of the 23rd, three hooligans suddenly came, claiming to buy cigarettes, and went directly to the accounting room, stealing 54 yuan in legal tender and a gold ring. Afterwards, the township head reported it to the district and then to the county for apprehension.

### Hangzhou

Nanping Section Begins Operations

The various projects on the Nanping section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have been largely completed. The engineering vehicles have been able to reach Pingxiang directly since the 18th of this month. In order to facilitate travel along the line, tickets will be sold on the material vehicles that run daily. It is understood that the two major bridges across the Ganjiang River and Yuanshui River in this section are being rushed to completion and will be finished by August 15th. The Railway Bureau plans to begin operations on August 1st, with a mixed passenger and freight train running once a day between Nanchang and Pingxiang in sections.

Setting Up a Bureau to Exploit Copper and Zinc Mines

In order to plan the exploitation of copper mines in Qingtian and lead-zinc mines in Zhuji, the Zhejiang Construction Department has proposed that the Provincial Government establish a preparatory office for the Mining Bureau. The candidate for director has already been internally determined and will be announced once Director Wang Zheng returns to Zhejiang. It is planned to start work on August 1st and formally establish the Mining Bureau three months later to gradually exploit the mineral resources. Its organization will be based on business principles, with the first step being to make it able to balance income and expenditure.

Inspection of Sanmen Bay Railway Completed

The Zhejiang Provincial Government, under orders, planned to build the Sanmen Bay Railway to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It commissioned the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to send engineer Xiong Zhengbo to organize a survey team to conduct the survey. After more than a month, the work has been completed, and he returned to the province yesterday to report.

### Ningbo

Achievements of the Central Hospital

Since Xia Yumin took over as the director of the Ningbo Central Hospital, he has been actively reorganizing and making every effort. Mr. Xia is rich in scholarly spirit and is famous for specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. The internal medicine doctor Sun Jingshi, surgery doctor Zhang Fangqing, Ding Xiajun etc. are all rich in experience, and carefully stick to their posts. Therefore, the hospital is getting better and better every day. Recently, a woman from Nanjing, Xu Dai, came to Ningbo specifically for treatment from Shanghai. According to her, there was a hard lump in her abdomen, which started around September or October last year. Shanghai doctors thought she was pregnant, but later felt that the condition was different, and recently she had severe pain. Her family was worried. Having long heard of Mr. Xia's reputation, she travelled to Ningbo with her family. After Mr. Xia examined her carefully, he determined that it was an ovarian cyst that required surgery. She was immediately hospitalized and properly treated. The surgery went very well. She was safely discharged from the hospital in less than twenty days. Afterwards, according to the patient's family, Dr. Xia's surgery skills are superb, and the stitches are neat and unnoticeable. The strictness of his disinfection procedures is unmatched elsewhere. Therefore, there are very few problems after the operation. It is really fortunate that Ningbo has such a good hospital.

Investigation of County Accounting

The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that the county accounting system has a profound impact on the improvement of county administration. It has specially sent accounting guidance committee members Yan Yilin and Pan Jingxing to Ningbo to investigate accounting matters in the seven counties under Ningbo's jurisdiction for study and improvement.

Murder Case Occurs on Yangshan Road

Ye Axiang, a resident of Dalaolai Street, Ninghai, and Xu Jiafa (a rickshaw puller) from Taiwan, have recently been working under foreman A Shui to load cement for the new post office building on Chezhan Road. At noon on the 23rd, A Shui gave each worker one yuan for lunch money, which was handed to Jiafa for distribution. Axiang did not receive any money and argued with Jiafa on Yangshan Road, resulting in a fight. Axiang was seriously injured and collapsed. The police officer on duty took the two to the police station. As the case involved injury, it was transferred to the court prosecutor's office for investigation. Unexpectedly, Axiang died before the cart reached the entrance of the court. The court took Jiafa into custody pending further investigation.

### Jiaxing

Detective Team Leader Accused

Rao Chun, the leader of the detective team of the Jiaxing County Government, is being accused in this incident because Xie Baoshu, an employee of the Shengye Silk Store in Shengze (23 years old), eloped with Shen Fubao (18 years old), a neighboring woman, on July 5, taking 2,200 yuan of store funds. The store reported this to the detective agencies in various places for investigation, stating that they would offer 30% of the recovered money and goods as a reward. Xie's whereabouts were then discovered by his guarantors, Wang Bingqiu and Chen Mengxiong, who found him in Hangzhou. They also found a deposit book for 1,700 yuan at the Shanghai Bank of China and 224 yuan in cash. On the 14th, they were arrested by the detective team at the Dadong Hotel in He Yu. Later, due to the failure to resolve the reward issue, the man and woman were detained for many days. The head of the Rao team dispatched personnel to Shanghai to withdraw the deposit without authorization, withholding a bonus of 570 yuan. The silk store claimed that it had found the escapee itself, and that it had withheld the bonus and illegally detained the people. It filed a complaint with the county government, accusing them of being illegal. Magistrate Weng summoned Rao, the leader of the group, for questioning on the 24th, and transferred him to the court for interrogation in the afternoon. After interrogation, he was ordered to be released on bail with a written guarantee of 800 yuan. At the same time, the county government has appointed Yuan Xiaojun, a service member of the supervisory office, as the head of the detective team.

Change of Water Police Captain

Fang Weizhou, captain of the fifth team of the Jiaxing Water Police, has resigned for some reason. The provincial government has appointed Xu Pucheng to take over and also serve as the director of the Salt Patrol Station. Xu has now taken over.

### Yuyao

Preventing Rice Crop Pests

Insect pests have recently occurred severely in Qinggang and other townships in Yuyao, spreading to more than a dozen townships. Rice crops have been damaged. The insects resemble green caterpillars. On the 22nd, rice stem borers and two- or three-brood moths were also discovered. The county government has repeatedly received requests from various townships for prevention and control, and has sent a telegram to Wu Guohua, director of the insect control area in Zhengxiang, urging farmers to take measures to prevent and control the pests in order to avoid their spread.

### Taizhou

Completion of Xianju Bridge

The east gate of Xianju County, Taizhou, is an important transportation route between Lin and Xian, and the end point of the Lin-Xian Highway. Because the Baishui Creek cuts off the north and south, traffic is blocked whenever there is heavy rain and flash floods. The county government, in view of this, launched a fundraising campaign last winter to build a large stone bridge, which is more than 600 feet long and 11 feet wide. The project took more than six months and was fully completed on the 18th.

### Nantong

Good Condition of Cotton Seedlings in the Reclamation Area

Due to favorable weather, the new cotton in the Jiangbei coastal reclamation area is growing very well. According to the initial survey, it is estimated that 6 million mu of cotton fields can yield 3 million dan of seed cotton. The Cotton Production Improvement Office will implement unified control of cotton seeds this autumn and has established large-scale ginning factories in Nantong, Dongtai, and Yancheng to eliminate inferior varieties.

### Taixian

Pressing Merchants to Contribute Funds for Guiding the Huai River

The merchants in this county should contribute 64,000 yuan for the labor-for-hire fund for the project of Guiding the Huai River into the Sea in Jiangsu Province. However, only 5,000 yuan has been received from the three chambers of commerce, less than one-tenth of the total amount. Recently, the Finance Department telegraphed the county government, ordering it to strictly urge the merchants to pay the funds so that the project could be concluded. The county government called a meeting of the chambers of commerce and decided that, in addition to the part of the county's land survey fee that the county government had diverted to offset the amount, there was still a shortfall of 30,000 yuan. The chambers of commerce were required to strictly urge merchants to pay the money and remit it to the county within the month. To ensure success, the county government has dispatched county committee members and police to the Chenggianghai Chamber of Commerce to assist in urging the debt-owing merchants to pay. However, most merchants are still delaying on the pretext of sluggish business and the summer slack season. It is difficult to expect the full amount to be collected in just over ten days.

### Hefei

Local Bank Collects Salt Tax on Behalf

The Anhui Local Bank has been in operation for more than a year, and its business is booming. Branches and agencies have been established in 63 counties throughout the province. The bank and its agencies collect tobacco and alcohol taxes and tuition fees in various places. The president of the local bank headquarters, Cheng Zhenji, has also negotiated with the Wuhu branch of the Bank of China to have the local bank collect all the salt taxes from various places along the Anhui shore. He has dispatched personnel to Datong, Sanhe, Tangjiagou, Xiangan, Zongyang, Yuncang, and other places to prepare.

Initiating Donations to Comfort the Troops

Teachers and staff of the Qingzhou Normal School Affiliated Primary School initiated a donation campaign on the 23rd. The teachers and staff each donated one yuan as a start, and then ordered all students to freely donate candy money every day in order to gather a large sum. The school's four to five hundred students are all willing to enthusiastically contribute, and as soon as they reach a certain amount, they will remit it to the northern front to comfort the troops. Other schools will also hold similar events within days.

### Raozhou

Establishing a Fish Fry Farming Ground

Poyang Lake in this county is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and is one of the five largest lakes in China. It extends from the Wu Le Changjiang to Hukou, spanning more than 300 li (unit of distance). It is very rich in fish. Most of the fish fry in the country is supplied by the shores of the lake. However, because the fishermen along the lake only know how to fish and do not know how to farm, the output is decreasing day by day. In order to develop the aquatic products of Poyang Lake and increase people's income, the provincial government plans to establish a fish fry farming ground in this county to engage in farming and has included it in this year's plan. The Construction Department is actively planning and implementing it.

Economic Special

### From the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition to Future Industrial Trends

— Pan Wenan

Among the Shanghai Municipal Government's tenth anniversary celebrations, the industrial exhibition was the most significant contribution to national economic construction. It was divided into three parts: a machinery industry exhibition, a handicrafts exhibition, and an industrial safety exhibition, each held at separate venues. After a thorough observation, I have gained many insights and believe that the future direction of industry in our country needs to change significantly compared to the past.

I believe that the displays at this machinery industry exhibition can break with past habits and create a new era in the history of industrial exhibitions. The exhibits were divided into four categories: physical objects, models, manufacturing processes, and work demonstrations. The work demonstrations showed viewers the manufacturing process and working procedures everywhere, which aroused the interest of the Chinese people in emerging industries. For example, Dalong Iron Works, Zhonghua Iron Works, Zhuya Iron Works, Gongqin Iron Works, etc., displayed their manufactured machines in an active way and tested them on the spot. The quantity was not large, but the quality was extremely refined, which was enough to show the progress of our national industry in recent years. The handicrafts exhibition area collected a wealth of items, although not limited to Shanghai, but mostly products from Shanghai. Some say that it is not easy for handicrafts to achieve these results under the pressure of mechanization, but if we observe with a critical eye, we can understand that most handicrafts have gradually adopted simple machinery and have moved from manual to semi-mechanical. The industrial safety exhibition displays were divided into eight categories: photographs, wall charts, statistics, charts, models, instruments, treasures, laws and regulations, and books. Each category of exhibits included facilities and guidance on factory safety and hygiene, statistics on factory accidents, physical objects of accidents, factory safety inspection instruments, etc. Everything related to industrial safety was included. After this industrial exhibition, I believe that those who run industries in the future should pay attention to at least the following five things to guide future industrial trends.

First, the future progress of industry must determine the overall plan. I believe that the superiority of national industry lies in its ability to produce in large quantities and to standardize, so that it can cope with ease and not be eliminated. The biggest shortcomings of the exhibits at this exhibition, except for the well-known factories, are that the styles are inconsistent, the production volume is not large, and they cannot be delivered on time. The situation of extending handicrafts is particularly obvious. I hope that after this exhibition, any factory, when starting up, must first have a comprehensive plan. At the beginning of each year, it must also determine the direction of this year's work based on the business trends of the previous year, so that it can seek corresponding results and not be constrained. The working machines in each factory must pay attention to precision and accuracy, and they should not be greedy for cheapness and affect the standards of the products.

Second, the future progress of industry, whether machine-made or handmade, must first study the tastes and psychology of customers in various places. The biggest shortcoming of the industrial exhibitions visited by various provinces this time is that they did not study whether there are domestic products to replace the popular imported goods in various places. At the same time, Shanghai industrialists did not pay attention to this issue when they visited and inspected various places. I heard that Mr. Zhu Gengtao of Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory went to North China to inspect the cotton market and found that there are two kinds of colored cloths that are very popular among middle-class families. Mr. Zhu returned to Shanghai and spent a month making these two kinds of cloths, which have already sold well in Shandong and Hebei provinces. I hope that in future exhibitions, the products of each factory should be marked with the sales of various cloths, which province sells which kind, and which place sells which kind, which is more meaningful and more likely to attract the attention of visitors from various provinces.

Third, in the future, industry should focus on people's daily needs and the replacement of foreign goods. The domestic goods displayed at the machinery industry and handicrafts exhibitions have not fully paid attention to this point. For example, Dalong's textile machines and Huacheng's motorcars can be said to completely replace foreign goods; at the same time, there are many decorations and toys, although many have the value of national art, but there are more appreciators and fewer inquirers, and most of them still feel that they have not reached the realm of perfection. Therefore, some people still say that the exhibits this time are too broad but not refined, and I hope that the exhibitors will pay attention to them urgently.

Fourth, in the future, industry should pay attention to the national defense industry and heavy industry. The exhibits of heavy industry were particularly lacking in the exhibition. For example, the bamboo steel bars of Xinhe Xing Steel Plant and the various acid alkali products of Yongli Plant were not recruited as much as possible. In this national crisis, what national defense industry do we rely on to maintain our territory? What heavy industry do we rely on to supply? When we think of this, we feel chills down our spines. I hope that industrialists will stop engaging in unnecessary and pointless competition among themselves in the future, causing excessive or contradictory products, and instead join the army and put more effort into heavy industry and national defense industry.

Fifth, the first thing to consider in the future direction of industry is the utilization of local raw materials. For example, the yu grass in Sichuan Province is the raw material for leather hats, the wool in North China is the hat blanks, and the reeds, madder, and yellow grass in Jiangbei, Taicang, and Jiading are all excellent raw materials for any woven fabric. If two or more colors are added, they will not only be liked by the Chinese people but also welcomed by foreigners. China is a country of raw materials, and raw materials are widely produced everywhere, which means that industry can be set up everywhere. If used properly, labor and transportation can be saved everywhere, and the pricing can be low. Local resources depend on this. Unfortunately, there are not many exhibits in the industrial exhibition that can utilize local raw materials to create new and unique things, which shows that natural resources have not been fully utilized.

All of the above is based on the opinions of visitors and my own humble opinions during the ten-day tour of various industrial exhibitions, and I would like to offer them for the authorities to discuss. As for the industrial safety exhibition, it is a brand-new undertaking that I could not have imagined ten years ago. I especially hope that those engaged in industry will pay special attention to its contribution to the future development of industry, which is no small matter.

### The Problem of Rice and Wheat Control in the Current Stage

— Li Yinbei

Rice and wheat control is essentially a branch of the controlled economic system. According to the theory of controlled economics, to implement rice and wheat control, there must first be a way to control rice and wheat. It is impossible in principle to rashly implement rice and wheat control without a way to control it. Today, the reality of rice and wheat control in our country is becoming increasingly clear. The choice of methods for controlling rice and wheat is indeed a task that cannot be ignored. The scope of this article is to discuss the methods for controlling rice and wheat today. The methods for controlling rice and wheat can be summarized into three types: ㊀ Consumption control of rice and wheat, ㊁ Production control of rice and wheat, ㊂ Transportation and sales control of rice and wheat. Now, I will introduce these three methods separately.

㊀ Consumption Control of Rice and Wheat

The consumption of rice and wheat is different from the consumption of general consumer goods. In terms of the consumption of general consumer goods, due to the disparity in purchasing power between the rich and the poor, the consumption volume of the people cannot be determined by the people's "desires." However, from the perspective of rice and wheat consumption, the consumption volume of each person cannot be determined by wealth. Therefore, in terms of the nature of rice and wheat consumption, rice and wheat are a kind of consumer goods with "social nature." Consumer goods with "social nature" should not be operated by private individuals for profit. Therefore, the purpose of controlling rice and wheat consumption is not for profit but to provide for the people. Therefore, its control methods are nothing more than the following two: ㊀ The government directly manages the distribution of rice and wheat nationwide; ㊁ The government indirectly supervises people's rice and wheat consumer cooperatives. The former control method can be called absolute control of rice and wheat, such as the rationing system implemented by the socialist Soviet government in the past. The Ration System belongs to this category. The latter is relative control of rice and wheat. It is entirely based on the principle of fairness and mutual assistance among the people to organize rice and wheat consumer cooperatives. It adopts a government-supervised, privately-operated system to control the consumption of rice and wheat nationwide. Now, should our country adopt the first method or the second method to control rice and wheat consumption? Our country is a country of the Three Principles of the People, and it cannot implement this policy of directly managing rice and wheat distribution like socialist Soviet Russia, in terms of the principle of statehood. Secondly, in terms of the national conditions of China and the Soviet Union: China has always been a society centered on the family economic system, and the socio-economic situation of Soviet Russia is also not close. From these two perspectives, the only way to control rice and wheat consumption is to organize national rice and wheat consumer cooperatives, which is easier to approach. However, from the perspective of implementing consumer cooperation, the following five issues must be given deep attention: ㊀ The private opening of rice boxes for edible purposes, such as brewing wine, making sugar, and feeding livestock, is of course something that consumer cooperatives cannot interfere with. Before the central government controls consumer cooperation, it should comprehensively plan in advance how to restrict brewing and sugar making, and how to find substitutes for feeding livestock. ㊁ The people of our country have low intelligence and lack a deep understanding of cooperation. Often, consumer cooperatives, in order to attract customers, stipulate that members and non-members receive dividends equally. If this continues, the number of non-members will inevitably increase sharply; and the person in charge of the cooperative, because of the need to be a member, non-members, although their numbers increase daily, have no opportunity to participate in the affairs of the cooperative. Therefore, the affairs of the cooperative may be manipulated by a few people! ㊂ Before rice and wheat are sold at half price, the price cannot be controlled by the cooperative. And merchants who sell rice and wheat, in order to compete with the cooperative, will inevitably drop their costs drastically in order to sell more. This situation is of course unfavorable to the cooperative. ㊃ According to the consumption cooperation public covenant, all sales are generally made on a cash basis. It is not possible to accept general customers who are accustomed to credit sales. However, at present, rice and wheat merchants are in the habit of extending credit. Consumer cooperatives, under this situation, should devise practical methods to remedy this. ㊄ Those who understand the operation methods of cooperatives may not be familiar with the situation of rice and wheat, and those who understand the situation of rice and wheat may not understand the operation methods of cooperatives. It is of course not easy to find a person who is well-rounded in all aspects, and at the time of the national rice and wheat control mobilization, the issue of the people who control consumption cannot be ignored.

㊁ Production Control of Rice and Wheat

The purpose of rice and wheat production control is, in general, to achieve a balance between rice and wheat production and consumption. However, strictly speaking, in peacetime, it is necessary to achieve (A) Chinese people eating rice and wheat from their own country; (B) three years of cultivation leaving enough surplus for one year of consumption. And in wartime, it is also necessary to manage the rice and wheat industry of the people nationwide; such as threshing, hulling, milling, grinding, etc. To implement the so-called food national defense line. Therefore, if China wants to embark on the path of controlling rice and wheat production, the following prerequisites must be paid attention to first: ㊀ The so-called Chinese people eating rice and wheat from their own country, in other words, is not eating foreign rice and foreign wheat. To achieve this goal, we must first pay attention to increasing rice and wheat production. According to American Beker's estimation, the arable land in China accounts for about 29% of the total land area; land not suitable for cultivation accounts for more than 70%. And the land that has already been cultivated is only 18,000 acres. In principle, it seems that we can engage in cultivation. However, the border areas are not suitable for cultivation due to the climate and geographical conditions. Therefore, in the short term, there is little hope for an increase in cultivated land. However, the original fertile land is being encroached upon by folk tombs, and the cultivated land is shrinking day by day; in recent years, due to the construction of traffic roads, the occupation of useful land by the people is even more numerous. To say to increase production is truly impossible! ㊁ If the cultivated area cannot be expanded, we must retreat and engage in the improvement of agricultural technology; such as the promotion of improved seeds, the implementation of pest control, the improvement of irrigation, and the improvement of soil fertility. According to this type of agricultural technology improvement, it is effective in collective farms. The agricultural land in our country has always been subject to the inheritance method of different sons. Therefore, the fragmentation of cultivated land is unique to any country. Using this fragmented land to implement this new type of agricultural technology, even if there is an effect, the effect will be extremely small. ㊂ To control the national rice and wheat industry, we must first amend the unequal treaties. Otherwise, the national rice and wheat will be controlled by the government, while the imperialist food industry in China will still refuse to comply. For example, in the wheat flour market in North China, it is almost entirely manipulated by merchants from a certain country. Observing this situation, controlling the national food industry without controlling the food industry of foreigners will not create an opportunity for the imperialists to disrupt the market.

㊂ Transportation and Sales Control of Rice and Wheat

Someone once calculated that the cost of transporting the same amount of grain a few hundred miles in China is more expensive than the price of food shipped across the Pacific Ocean from the United States to China for sale. No wonder there is a surplus of rice and wheat in one place and a panic of rice and wheat in another place in the same province in China at the same time. Therefore, the responsibility of rice and wheat transportation and sales control is to regulate the surplus and deficit of rice and wheat nationwide. However, to regulate the surplus and deficit, it must be done through the consistent operation of the four institutions of purchasing, storing, transporting, and distributing rice and wheat nationwide. There are still many problems hidden in these transportation and sales institutions. If you don't believe it, please try to list the following: ㊀ The prerequisite for purchasing rice and wheat is the control of rice and wheat prices. Because without this, rice and wheat cannot be centralized. However, according to the international economic situation in the country, the price of rice and wheat in China is not only closely related to the price of rice and wheat in the domestic producing areas; it also closely follows the price of rice and wheat in foreign producing areas. Therefore, the determination of rice and wheat prices in our country is sometimes affected by the price of rice and wheat in domestic producing areas; sometimes it is dominated by the price of rice and wheat in foreign producing areas. Therefore, even if the control of transportation and sales can control the price of domestic rice and wheat, the external attack of foreign producing area prices is still a considerable problem. ㊁ The prerequisite for transporting rice and wheat is the soundness of the domestic transportation economy. The transportation construction in our country in recent years has generally focused on highways. However, highways can only be used for military transportation and passenger transportation. Due to the inconsistency of economic conditions, freight transportation has not been opened. Rice and wheat are a kind of heavy cargo, which is obviously not suitable for highway transportation conditions. Therefore, even if highway construction advances rapidly, it will not be of any benefit to the transportation of rice and wheat. As for the railway: although the railway can transport rice and wheat, it suffers from the short railway mileage and other problems. The transportation of rice and wheat is still not competent. Recently, the Yuehan Road has been opened to traffic. In theory, Xiang rice entering Guangdong should not be a problem. However, the facts show that the rice shortage in Guangdong Province is urgent, and Xiang rice is still slow to arrive! From this example, it can be seen that the key to the rice and wheat transportation problem must still be the soundness of the transportation network. ㊂ The method of collecting and distributing rice and wheat in our country has always been to distribute it to local customers through a collection and distribution center. For example, Shanghai is the collection and distribution center for rice and wheat nationwide. Its distribution of rice and wheat has always been procured by the three major customer groups of Nanyang, Beiyang, and the Yangtze River. Then, from the local customer groups to the rice and wheat firms, to the rice and wheat retail stores, and to the rice and wheat consumers. The organization for controlling the distribution of rice and wheat must have rice and wheat purchasing cooperatives in various places to replace the customer groups in the commercial organization. If not, and if transitional or accommodating methods are used, then how can we supervise these rice and wheat intermediaries who are mainly for profit under the principle of equal distribution of rice and wheat to provide for the people.

From the perspective of the above three control methods, the three control methods in the current stage are actually interconnected. To implement rice and wheat control, we should integrate consumption, production, and transportation and sales. There must be no delay. At present, in addition to the control of transportation and sales, the Ministry of Finance has established the National Food Transportation and Sales Bureau. As for the control of consumption and production, the government has also had plans in recent years. The former is like the planned establishment of the National Food Administration, and the latter is like the "China Rice and Wheat Self-Sufficiency Plan" drafted by the Rural Reconstruction Committee last time. It can be said that there has been considerable planning for the entire national rice and wheat control problem. However, the problems will only be known after actual practice; therefore, I wrote this article based on the possible scope of consideration. It is for reference before controlling rice and wheat. As for the problems encountered in actual practice after implementing the entire rice and wheat control in the future, we have no way to imagine them at this moment.

### World Wheat Reserves and Countermeasures China Should Take

— Jingshi

Food and military equipment are the key to victory or defeat in wartime. Therefore, all countries prepare for the occurrence of war and explore methods of food control or food management in advance to ensure that supply and demand correspond at that time, so as to increase or extend the country's combat power. For example, the Food Administration of the United States, the Food Control of England, and the Food Supply Control of France and Russia are all methods used in wartime, which are different from the general agricultural policies in peacetime. Various economic protectionism around the world pay special attention to wheat. Because all countries mainly eat wheat, even those who usually use rice and wheat interchangeably use wheat because it is easy to carry and most suitable for military needs after being made into dry food. Therefore, wheat is no less than the center of the food problem in the modern extraordinary situation.

In the past year or two, countries around the world have focused on expanding their armies and are concerned about the food problem in wartime in the future. The measures that have been implemented, such as the establishment of a food council in the United States last year, and the implementation of a part of its national defense plan, intend to greatly increase the accumulation of wheat, that is, to transfer all of the approximately 50 million bushels that Canada can supply for this purpose. There are also proposals to increase from 50 million bushels to 67 million to 76 million bushels. Italy is also actively absorbing the import of foreign wheat. On January 30 of this year, it implemented the reduction of the wheat import tax from the original tax rate of 32 lire per 100 kilograms to 18 lire, and the flour tax from 49 lire to 27.5 lire. Argentina, due to the increased need for wheat, cancelled the minimum price regulation in December last year, which is equivalent to the cancellation of export subsidies. Lithuania, fearing that the export of wheat would affect the people's food and national defense, ordered a ban on the export of wheat last winter.

As mentioned above, the goal of various measures taken by countries is to absorb wheat reserves for wartime use. However, according to estimates from all parties, the import volume required by various countries for world wheat consumption last year was 52.8 million bushels, which is less than the previous estimate, and the actual supply of exports is only 47.5 million bushels, which is less than the estimated number. Among them, 30 million bushels are absorbed by the United States, which was not available before (because the United States is a wheat-producing country, so the import volume handled by merchants in various needed countries is often less than half of the 900 million bushels in 1928-9.

At the same time, the world's wheat production last year has been reduced to the lowest level in nine years ㊀ Last year, the three major production areas of the United States, Australia, and Canada experienced a severe drought after three years of poor harvests, and the output was even worse than before. Therefore, the United States continued to be a wheat-importing country for the previous two years, at 1.934 million bushels. ㊁ Italy's wheat reserves have decreased, and the condition of new wheat is also poor, so it is more eager to hoard. ㊂ Although Argentina has increased slightly, the number that can be exported is still small. ㊃ In Australia, various countries are competing to buy its wheat reserves; ㊄ It is not necessarily reliable that the Soviet Union's agricultural technology has improved. Because of the repayment of short-term debts and the increase in gold production, it is not necessary to dump a large amount like in 1930-1931.

Due to the above situation, Chicago wheat rose to $1.43 last December. It has been rising ever since. According to the poor harvest, the rise in grain prices is only a temporary phenomenon. If countries hoard for war purposes, the trend will not be easy to decline.

Our country's food relies on both rice and wheat, which are used to regulate each other. However, in this autumn when the international situation is increasingly tense, and with our Eastern neighbor coveting us, we should also plan for self-sufficiency as early as possible. In reality, our country's wheat production has always been insufficient, and a large amount of flour and wheat is imported every year. In the most recent five years, the import of wheat reached 10,714,634 quintals in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and decreased to 1,168,093 quintals last year. The import of flour was 1,957,113 quintals in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and also decreased to 310,018 quintals last year. The reason for this decline is that on the one hand, our country's wheat production has slightly increased, with the harvest last year estimated at 46.1 million piculs, an increase of 7.7% compared to the previous year. On the other hand, the above-mentioned various situations have made it impossible for wheat from the United States and Australia to be imported into our country, and at the same time, it has been affected by it, forming a phenomenon of high flour and wheat prices, which has a profound and significant impact on the future of the people's food.

The reason is ㊀ Last year, the world wheat price generally rose, and although domestic needs felt insufficient, consumers were unwilling to import foreign wheat at a high price: ㊁ Japan's wheat harvest last year was 6% less than in previous years, and at the same time, it retaliated against Australia's wool trade policy, so it turned to our country to purchase a large amount of flour and wheat. According to the customs records, the export of wheat last year was 316,808 quintals, which is close to the more than 400,000 quintals exported in the 20th year, and reached 49,356 quintals in the first five months of this year. The export of flour last year was 92,172 quintals, which also exceeded the previous years, most of which were purchased by Japan. Therefore, the domestic shortage is becoming more and more acute, so the price of flour and wheat is becoming more and more expensive, creating a serious situation for the people's food. This year, the domestic provinces are suffering from floods and droughts, and the harvest has decreased. The hoarding policies of various countries in the world have not changed, and there is a tendency to increase. And Japan's purchases are more than before, so even though the new wheat is on the market recently, the prices in various producing areas have risen sharply. The news of the Japanese purchasing in various places has been recorded in various newspapers, especially in Wuhu, so the highest wheat price in the local area once reached 9.3 yuan per bag, creating a new record for the past years, which is more expensive than rice by 34 cents. This phenomenon is indeed rare in recent years. It is even more unreasonable at the time when the new wheat is on the market. Try to list the prices for the same period in the past five years as follows, and the abnormal bear state will be revealed.

As shown in the numbers in the table, compared with the same month last year, the price of American wheat has increased by 92%, the price of wheat in Hankou and Jinpu Road has increased by about 50%, and the price of flour has increased by more than 60%. In theory, when the new wheat is on the market, its price must fall, but in the past two years, it has suddenly reversed and risen. It is no wonder that the price continued to rise in the second half of last year, reaching a huge amount of one times higher than the price in June and July of the previous year in December. This year is also the same, and with the poor harvest and Japan taking the opportunity to purchase, the price of flour and wheat has risen even more without end. Under this situation, we are already in a situation of food panic among the people in peacetime, and if the previous Lugouqiao Incident breaks out, if there is no way to develop a peaceful path, then the expansion into a war between the two countries is a matter of course. Our country has always lacked thorough food control methods, so once it falls into an extraordinary situation, the urgent need to prepare the national military food and the food for the rear will be more urgent than in any country.

Recently, the export of wheat has been prohibited by the Ministry of Finance, and more than 30,000 bags of wheat flour transported from Shanghai to Tianjin have also been detained by Shanhaiguan. We believe that this move is indeed a necessary measure at the moment. Recently, the local food groups in this city have agreed that in the future, domestic transshipment of food for military use must be certified by the local military authorities, and for civilian use, it must be certified by the chamber of commerce. However, in various trading ports in our country, there are many Japanese military and civilians stationed. If they are driven by high profits, local traitors will inevitably sell them privately. Recently, it has been heard that there is a decision to ban the shipment of flour, rice, and wheat to Dalian, Lushun, and Qinhuangdao. In addition, it is hoped that from now on, the national food control mobilization should be expanded and carried out quickly!

The main points of food control are ㊀ Investigate the supply and demand situation; ㊁ Set up food depots for storage; ㊂ Operate transportation and sales by the government; ㊃ Advocate frugality; ㊄ Transform the existing market institutions, etc. However, judging from the current state, the matter is as urgent as the stars, and we should first start with the first and third points. Regarding the investigation of the supply and demand situation, we can instruct the local military and political organs of each province, city, and county to jointly investigate and register the local storage and transportation and sales situation with the chamber of commerce and the food association, so as to facilitate military use and rear allocation. On the one hand, in order to facilitate wartime transportation, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation can jointly operate transportation and sales, so as to speed up the time and transportation. The other points must be determined by the fullness of time, and they cannot be achieved suddenly. We hope that before this war opportunity has not expanded, and when the new grain is about to be released in succession, the whole country will promote it as soon as possible, which is tantamount to increasing the strongholds of national defense.

### Dried Fruits and Vegetables

Improved Quality of Orchid Seeds: All sand and mud must be sifted out starting August 1st.

Orchid seeds are a type of spice needed by dry tobacco and general incense candle stores. If the price is right, incense candle stores will buy more. However, because the quality of orchid seeds produced in Zhangzhou is not pure, there is often fine sand mixed in. The owners think that the flowers and sand are of equal value, and they have not been screened and improved. However, they do not know that the sales have been hindered because of this, and the foundation is in danger of being shaken. It is also heard that incense candle stores mainly use sandalwood for spices. For example, if four ounces of sandalwood are replaced with orchid seeds, one catty will be needed because it is mixed with sand, branches, and leaves. Having learned from this, the industry association has drafted a method that, starting August 1st, the market price of all orchid seeds will be based on the standard of sifting out the mud and sand. If there are goods mixed with sand, they must be sifted out before the price is determined. At the same time, all the shops have sent letters to the owners, requiring them to sift out the sand in the future to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and to promote domestic goods. Sandalwood is a foreign product, while orchid seeds are local products.

Daylily Inventory Runs Short

According to reliable information from Zhenjiang and Xuzhou, the supply of daylily has recently become scarce, and the production price has rebounded. According to the inspection of the current stock here, most of it has been sold. For example, the ones purchased by the Quanzhou and Taiwan gangs totaled about 400 large packages, and the Guangdong gang also purchased about 200 large and small packages. If all of them are packed and delivered today, the more expensive goods will be in short supply. However, there are still stocks of the lower-grade Zhongxing vegetables, but they do not sell well. Yesterday, the market price for Xuzhou vegetables was 25.5 yuan, the price for ordinary vegetables was 25 yuan, the price for Daxing vegetables was 24.5 yuan, the price for ordinary vegetables was 23 yuan, and the price for lower grades varied. According to the current situation, there will be no sign of recovery within a week.

### Withdrawal of Japanese Marine Corps from Posts - Situation in Zhabei Eases

Okamoto States No Intention to Expand - Citizens' Associations Announce, "Do Not Panic"

According to the China News Agency, the Japanese Shanghai Naval Marine Corps claimed last night (the 24th) that a soldier named Miyazaki went missing. Consequently, troops were dispatched to guard the border between the Hongkou area and the Chinese Concession, inspecting pedestrians and vehicles, and even intruding into the Chinese territory. The situation was serious and unusually tense. Until dawn yesterday, the Japanese military posts had withdrawn one after another, and the situation gradually eased. The tense atmosphere of the previous night was completely swept away. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Okamoto Visits Acting Mayor Yu

Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, Japanese Consul General Okamoto, accompanied by Secretary Fukui, visited Acting Mayor Yu at the Municipal Government. He expressed gratitude to the Chinese side for assisting in the investigation of the disappearance of Japanese soldier Sadao Miyazaki and for their attitude in handling the case. He reiterated the details of the incident, requested the Municipal Government to continue the investigation to find the missing soldier, and emphasized that the Japanese side had no intention of expanding the matter. The sentries deployed last night had already been withdrawn this morning. He hoped to inform all parties to avoid misunderstandings. Acting Mayor Yu responded that after receiving the report, the Municipal Government immediately sent staff to the scene to investigate and contacted the Shanghai Municipal Police. Many suspicious points were discovered. For example, the Japanese youth Okazaki Yoshio mentioned in the report could not be found at the address provided. Furthermore, the incident occurred in a prosperous area, and the time was not late at night. How could no one have witnessed the event? The Japanese Marine Corps, without waiting for the truth to be clarified, mobilized fully armed, and their sentries crossed the boundary of the Concession, causing rumors and a tense situation. It was deeply regrettable. If the Chinese side had not adopted a calm and composed attitude, the consequences would have been unimaginable. He requested that the relevant parties be informed that they must act cautiously in the future. It is better to consult beforehand than to express regret afterward. This would make it easier to maintain local security and avoid misunderstandings. Regarding the request for assistance in the investigation, the Municipal Government considered it appropriate, because the Japanese side had, based on unfounded reports, speculated that the soldier was abducted by Chinese. The Municipal Government did not need to wait for the Japanese request to be eager to know the truth of the case. After about half an hour of talks, the Japanese Consul General departed.

Japanese Military Posts Withdraw Yesterday Morning

The Japanese Naval Marine Corps dispatched posts to inspect pedestrians and vehicles in the Hongkou area and the border with the Chinese Concession on the previous night, and even intruded into the Chinese territory, stationing troops in the Tiantong'an Road and Ji'erpai Bridge area. Until dawn yesterday morning, the Japanese military posts withdrew, leaving only a small number of troops stationed at the Japanese Elementary School on North Sichuan Road, the Japanese Girls' Elementary School on Ouyang Road, the Liu San Garden on Jiangwan Road, the Hanaya Sake Brewery on Garden Street, and the Japanese cemetery at Baziqiao. The Japanese troops stationed in the Liu San Garden were still searching passing pedestrians and vehicles. Liang Fuchu, the chief of the Beizhan Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, visited Takeda, the chief of staff of the Japanese Special Marine Corps, yesterday morning at 9:30 AM to negotiate a halt to the searches. Takeda accepted and agreed to stop the searches.

Tokyo Newspapers Publish in Large Font

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th - All newspapers on the morning of the 25th published in extra-large font the disappearance of the Japanese soldier in Shanghai and the fact that the 37th Division of Beiping had not yet fully withdrawn. However, the Asahi Shimbun took a more cautious stance. According to a Shanghai telegram from the Domei News Agency, the discovery of a military cap and collar badge was reported by a young man claiming to be Okazaki Yoshio, who handed them over to soldier Yanagita at North Sichuan Road. While Yanagita was reporting by phone, the young man escaped. An investigation into his claimed residence revealed that there were no Japanese residences there, making the situation highly suspicious. Miyazaki was granted permission to stay out overnight on the 24th, so his whereabouts are still unknown.

Concession Adds Posts - Shanghai is Peaceful

As the situation in the urban area is as described above, in the Concession, all sections of the extended road connecting to the urban area, such as the main roads of North Sichuan Road, have had additional police posts. Japanese soldiers are stationed at the Japanese Elementary School on North Sichuan Road, and Japanese patrol teams are also frequently seen. The situation in the Caojiadu Zhongshan Road area of ​​western Shanghai is as peaceful as usual. The Toyoda Spinning Mill, both inner and outer mills, has traditionally had Japanese troops stationed there, with no new developments. However, there has been a slight increase in police and Concession police patrols on the main traffic roads of the extended roads.

Consulate Holds Meeting - Japanese Warships Arrive in Succession

Although yesterday was Sunday, the Japanese Consulate General on Huangpu Road remained open as usual. Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun and important officials of the Municipal Government also went to the office. The commander of the Japanese Marine Corps, Okawauchi, and the naval attache of the embassy, ​​Tadao Honda, visited Japanese Consul General Okamoto Kisei yesterday morning at 11:00 AM and held a meeting to discuss the handling of the matter. After the meeting, Okamoto, accompanied by Secretary Fukui, went to the Municipal Government at 11:30 AM to visit Acting Mayor Yu and decided to visit the authorities of the Public Concession again today to request continued assistance in the investigation. Furthermore, the Japanese Residents' Associations also convened a temporary board meeting at the Japanese Club on Pong Road yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to decide on their stance. The "Kuri No. 1," a destroyer belonging to the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, which had previously sailed from Shanghai to Hankou, was ordered to return to Shanghai and entered the port at 11:55 AM yesterday morning. Together with the flagship of the Third Fleet "Izumo" and the destroyer "Ren" that arrived in Shanghai the day before, there are now three Japanese warships in the Huangpu River.

Civil Associations Announce Calm Response

The heads of the citizens' associations in the Hongkou district believe that the Hongkou urban area has been affected by the current situation in recent years, and the economy has already been severely impacted. If another incident were to occur, the future would be even more unimaginable. They were deeply concerned and held an emergency meeting yesterday morning to decide to issue an announcement to the citizens in the district, urging them to respond calmly and not to panic. The announcement is recorded as follows: "It has been learned that the Japanese Marine Corps dispatched a large number of troops last night under the pretext of a missing soldier, conducting inspections and patrols. After negotiations with the Municipal Government, the situation has eased. It is hoped that the citizens in the district will respond calmly and not panic. It must be known that in today's world, there is no distinction between the front and the rear, and there is no such thing as safety. Sacrifice is no longer sufficient to save the country. It is hoped that everyone will maintain their livelihoods and maintain the market as a priority."

Japanese School Builds Observation Tower

According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Japanese High School on North Sichuan Road, established by the Japanese Residents' Association, was suddenly guarded by three Japanese Marine Corps soldiers yesterday morning. A small new building was being rushed to completion on the roof of the school yesterday. Judging from its shape, it appears to be an observation tower.

Japanese Soldiers Scout, Escort Back to Camp

At around 7:00 PM last night, a Japanese Marine Corps squad leader, Nakayama Mizuide, accompanied by a soldier, sneaked into the area of the Sun Temple in Zhabei to scout. The security team, fearing an accident, escorted the squad leader and his soldier to the Beizhan Branch. The head of the branch, Liang, personally escorted them to the Japanese headquarters. The Japanese headquarters expressed sincere gratitude to Director Liang for his prudent handling of the matter.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Subcommittee Approves Existing Mezzanine Floors to Remain

However, Mezzanines in Small Factories Should be Removed - New Ones Can Apply for Permits

Regarding the issue of mezzanine floors built in all Chinese-style houses in the Public Concession, the Municipal Council was petitioned by a Western taxpayer at last year's annual meeting to investigate the current situation, as the construction of mezzanine floors by Chinese citizens hindered fire safety and hygiene. They proposed that the original 80,000+ mezzanine floors be completely demolished. Subsequently, the Council organized various subcommittees to improve housing in the Concession. After a lengthy period of investigation and research, they appointed Chinese members Xi Yuhua, Jiang Yiping, and Jin Jun, the British general manager of a foreign firm, to study the report of the Housing Investigation Committee and decide on the demolition issue. According to the reporter of the East China News Agency, the details are as follows:

All Directors Agree Not to Demolish

Directors Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Jin Jun concluded that the mezzanine floor case in the Public Concession was still an economic issue. Mezzanine floors have existed since the establishment of the Concession. Although there are many vacant houses at present, it has not affected the residents of the mezzanine floors. If all 80,000+ mezzanine floors in the entire area were to be completely demolished, it would not only affect the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of coolie residents, but also result in a loss of material resources of at least three million yuan. At the same time, fires often occur in the Public Concession, and according to statistical research, they are not caused by mezzanine floor residents. In terms of hygiene, mezzanine floor residents are not only very cautious but also pay great attention to morality, because they live and rest in the three-foot mezzanine floor. If there is any uncleanness, it will affect them first. Furthermore, if the mezzanine floors were to be demolished, the industry and commerce in the Public Concession would be destroyed. Therefore, it is advocated that before the Municipal Council builds a large number of public housing units in the Concession, the relevant economic and safe mezzanine floors should only be encouraged to administer and improve, and cautioned at any time to pay attention to fire prevention and hygiene, except for those that are absolutely necessary. However, it should not be demolished. After being submitted to the entire board of directors for discussion, it was unanimously agreed that mezzanine floors should be allowed to continue to exist in their current state without being demolished. It was reported that when the Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Guo Shun, Yuan Ludeng, and Xi Jiang attended, they also explained in detail the plight of the mezzanine floors in terms of economic, industrial, commercial, and social conditions, which finally garnered the sympathy of the foreign directors.

All Original Mezzanine Floors Remain the Same

After more than a year of entanglement, the mezzanine floor issue has finally come to an end. According to the reporter, except for the mezzanine floors in small factories (i.e., those built in factory sites in the alleys that affect the safety of the entire alley), which must be demolished, the remaining residential mezzanine floors can remain the same.

New Mezzanine Floors Can Obtain Licenses

According to the research results of the subcommittee, under the current circumstances, in addition to the existing mezzanine floors in the Public Concession that can remain as they are, citizens can also be allowed to build new mezzanine floors in the Public Concession, given the population density, so that the poor can have a place to live. After the reason was submitted to the board of directors, it was also approved. If new mezzanine floors are to be built, a license can be obtained from the Public Works Department. However, the following points must be noted when starting construction: ㊀ The issue of egress in case of fire must be considered. ㊁ The distance between the upper mezzanine floor and the roof must be eight feet. ㊂ The distance between the lower mezzanine floor and the ground must be at least seven feet, and its area must not exceed half of the floor area of the house.

### Whereabouts of Prominent Figures

The issue of reorganizing the Guizhou monetary system, after Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Economic Council, went to Guizhou to confer with Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others, has now been further negotiated on specific details. According to the reporter of the East China News Agency, the current proposal is to set one legal tender dollar equal to one Guizhou dollar and eighty cents, including settlement. The Guizhou branch of the Central Bank can be established within this year.

### Xu Yiqiao, Who Studied Social Education in Europe, Returned to China Yesterday

### Coal and Rice Merchants Prevent Enemy Support by Traitorous Merchants

Coal Merchants to Hold Meeting in Coming Days to Discuss - Rice Prices Stable, Ample Inventory

Coal Industry

The National Coal Production and Sales Association of this city is deeply saddened that, during this tense period, unscrupulous merchants have gone mad and provided coal to the enemy. Furthermore, most of the coal used in this city is transported from North China. Now that North China is under pressure, transportation is bound to be affected. Once freight transport is disrupted, Shanghai may face a shortage. Moreover, the current inventory in the city is not large. In addition to contacting major coal mining companies for assistance, all coal merchants have been notified to supervise each other to prevent traitors from taking advantage of the opportunity. The Coal Industry Association of this city, in addition to offering material condolences to the industry, will convene a joint meeting of all executives and supervisors in the coming days to discuss strict measures to prevent the industry from providing coal to the enemy and how to alleviate coal shortages when freight transport is disrupted.

Rice Merchants

Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the rice merchants in this city have decided to strictly prevent traitorous merchants from transporting grain to support the enemy. Therefore, rice shops in both the north and south markets have unanimously refused to handle goods for customer groups from Qinhuangdao, Dalian, Yingkou, and Andong. The industry is taking a mutually supervised attitude, which is still united and determined. At the same time, rice prices in this city have recently become stable. According to an accurate investigation, the amount of rice stored in the warehouses includes Shuntai, Mitsubishi, Taikoo, China Merchants, Huazhan, Qichang, Yitaixing, Fuxin, Osaka, China, Continental, Four Lines, Xingye, Shiye, Jiangsu, and Zikang, etc. Sixteen companies have a total of 478,000+ bags. The amount of rice sold downstream in the north and south markets is about 1,000 shi (a unit of dry measure). Therefore, the total amount of rice stored in this city is estimated to be 480,000 bags.

### The Reporter's Inspection This Morning

Baoshan Road Area is Quiet as Usual - Japanese Plainclothes Squads Still Very Active

After 3:00 AM this morning, the reporter revisited the Zhabei area. Compared with the night before and yesterday morning, the situation was significantly calmer. Doushan Road and Xibaoxing Road have returned to the state before 9:00 PM the night before last. However, Japanese Marine Corps soldiers were still scattered near all the bridges along the Yokohama River. Although the number could not be ascertained, it is estimated to be around 200 or more. The Japanese plainclothes squads were very active in various places along the river, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Sometimes, clapping sounds could be heard from across the bank. The distance between the Japanese Marine Corps sentries and each bridgehead was about 200 to 300 meters.

### Sun Ke Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss the Situation in North China

Song Zheyuan Telegrams Central Government Report - States He Did Not Accept Humiliating Conditions

Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, accompanied by legislator Chuan Bingchang, took the 11:00 PM express train from Beijing the night before last and arrived at the Zhenru station at 6:50 AM yesterday morning. He then returned to his residence on Columbia Road to rest. At his residence, Sun met with reporters from various newspapers. He was extremely concerned about the situation in Shanghai and first inquired about the facts of the actions of the Japanese Marine Corps the night before. Then he talked about the situation in North China. According to him, there were various rumors about the withdrawal of troops, but Song Zheyuan's report to the Central Government stated that he had not accepted any humiliating compromise conditions. However, the ambition of the Japanese is insatiable, and although the situation has eased for the time being, its severity has not diminished. The government, while striving for peace, must adhere to the minimum of the four points put forward by Chairman Chiang at the Lushan Conference. His trip to Guangdong is still undecided, as he must wait and see the evolution of the situation.

### Request to Lift the Ban on Silkworm Cocoon Exports: Silk Industry Groups Petition This Morning

Cocoon Prices Soar, Silk Factories Unable to Reel Silk

Silk reeling factories in this city, recently due to the Jiangxi and Hunan Provincial Silk Control Committees' ban on the export of dried cocoons, face a cutoff of raw material supply, threatening a complete shutdown. Over 30,000 workers are in danger of losing their livelihoods. Therefore, labor and management groups have repeatedly met to discuss the issue and have appealed to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, as well as the Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committees, requesting the lifting of the ban to maintain operations. Now, to seek assistance from the municipal party and government authorities, the trade association has appointed Shen Huachen, Zhang Peishen, Xu Peixiong, Tang Yeqin, Chen Xiupu of the Fourth District Silk Reeling Workers' Union, Yuan Yunlong of the Sixth District Silk Reeling Workers' Union, Yang Gengti, Liu Sanbao, and others as representatives to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau this morning. They request that their appeal be forwarded to the central government and that the governments of Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces be consulted to revoke the ban and allow transportation, so as to safeguard the livelihoods of over 30,000 workers. According to sources in the silk industry, the dry cocoons owned by silk factories in Shanghai are now exhausted. The stocks in silk warehouses are all leftover cocoons. Recently, due to the cutoff of supply, the market has been monopolized, and prices have been raised, so silk factories cannot purchase cocoons for reeling. Of the 44 thread factories currently operating in this city, in addition to the Yuan Lü and He Tai factories, which have already been forced to shut down, other factories such as Qin Yi, Fuxing, Jincheng, Yifeng, and Xinchang will soon follow suit. At most, all manufacturers will be shut down within a month. Therefore, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers are of great concern.

### Ministry of People's Training Explains Voting Rights of Organizations

Official Letter Sent to the Municipal Party Headquarters for Verification Yesterday

The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city received a notice from the Ministry of People's Training of the Central Government yesterday, explaining the issue of voting rights when mass organizations hold meetings. The original text is as follows: "The New Life Movement Headquarters has sent a letter regarding the voting rights of proxies when mass organizations hold meetings, and whether the quorum is related to the number of proxies (if each proxy accounts for two-thirds, are the resolutions passed legal?). It is not known whether your ministry has any regulations on this matter. If so, please provide a copy of the materials for reference and a response." Having approved this, it is found that there are no explicit regulations on this point in the various laws and regulations formulated by this ministry. According to the Civil Code, the legal acts of proxies (except for specific ones) are considered valid. Therefore, legal proxies attending mass organization meetings should have voting rights. Furthermore, the quorum should have no relationship with the number of legal representatives attending. That is, if legal proxies account for two-thirds, the resolutions passed are still legal. However, in order to be cautious about important proposals of various mass organizations, if proxies accounting for one-third of the total number express in writing within ten days after the resolution of a certain proposal that the proxy's attendance violates the intent of the authorization and make a proposal and vote, the proposal should be reconsidered. In addition to replying by letter and sending letters to various departments, a corresponding letter is hereby delivered in the hope that you will check it for compliance.

### Money Industry Association Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday

Discussion of Loan Proposal Not Concluded

The Shanghai Money Industry Association held its 44th executive committee meeting of the third session at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Ningbo Road Association Hall. After reporting the minutes of the previous meeting and various reports on the reserve fund, the following was discussed: (1) The Municipal National Products Promotion Association sent a letter stating that it is not appropriate to tighten loans by silver and money industries during the serious national crisis. After the committee members expressed their opinions separately, they all believed that whether or not each money shop tightens loans is purely a voluntary action of each business day, entirely depending on the economic capacity of each. This association can hardly impose mandatory regulations. Moreover, the situation is tense, and it is difficult to find anyone tightening loans, but there are also many who are operating as usual or expanding loans. This association shares the same desire to support industry and commerce in order to coexist and prosper. As a result of the discussion, no decision was made on this issue. Subsequently, many routine cases were resolved before adjourning at around 3:00 PM.

### Postal Knowledge Q & A (33)

(Question) Our store is a bookstore and publishes many books. I read in the 28th issue of your Q&A that the post office has a method for ordering books on behalf of people, and the post office has a catalog of books that can be ordered on behalf of people for anyone to read. I don’t know whether the books entered in this catalog are obtained by the post office through its own investigation or through other procedures (i.e., such as an application from the issuing bookstore or the author to the post office) before they are entered. Please let me know so that the books published by our store can also be included in the list of books that the post office can order on behalf of people.

For the above types of books, if they are published in a place with a post office and have not been prohibited from postal delivery in the year, the publisher can fill out an application form and pay a registration fee of one national currency unit per book to the postal administration to which the place of publication belongs. The application form should be written in regular script in duplicate, stating: 1. Category of book; 2. Title of book; 3. Name of author or translator. If it is a translation, please also include the name of the original author; 4. Name of publisher; 5. Name of publishing house; 6. Address of publishing house; 7. Date of publication and edition; 8. Version; 9. Binding style; 10. Number of volumes; 11. Postage and weight (the so-called postage and weight refers to the gross weight of one book including a suitable wrapping and the postage it should collect. This weight is calculated in grams. If the publisher voluntarily waives the postage, it can be noted with the words "Postage waived" and the weight does not need to be filled in); 12. Actual selling price (i.e., the actual retail price of the store); 13. A brief description of no more than fifty words, or a table of contents; 14.

### Young Son of British Knight Arrested for Theft in Shanghai

Immersed in Cabarets and Dance Halls, Empty Pockets and Exhausted Money - Repeatedly Stole Typewriters, Calculating Machines, etc. - Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison, Suspended for Two Years

He Yongyi, a young man from Guangdong, 25 years old, whose father, He Kai (a transliteration of the English Ho.Kia), has resided in Hong Kong for a long time. Because he has contributed to the British government, he has been awarded the title of Knight, and his entire family has also been naturalized as British citizens. Everyone in Hong Kong and Guangdong knows Sir He Kai. He has more than ten children, one of whom is married to the late national government figure Wu Chaoshu. He Yongyi is the youngest son, so his parents dote on him deeply, allowing him to wander freely and do whatever he wants. His daily needs are all supplied by his mother. Recently, he suddenly came to Shanghai and lived at No. 9, Lane 697, Edward Road. He spends all day immersed in cabarets and dance halls, leading to financial difficulties. In addition, he suffers from illness. Although his brothers, He Yongqian, etc., have high-ranking jobs in Shanghai, they all despise their brother's usual behavior, so He Yongyi has no face to ask his brothers for help, and he has resorted to theft. On June 18th, he went to Room 523 of the HSBC building and stole a typewriter worth 100 yuan. On June 30th, he went to Room 407, No. 2 Beijing Road, and stole miscellaneous items worth 169 yuan, spending the money. On July 10th, he went to No. 181 Nanjing Road, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and stole a calculating machine worth 1,600 yuan. He was just about to escape with the stolen goods when he was seen by the company's clerk and immediately arrested. He was taken to the General Police Station. Because He was a British citizen, he was sent to the British Consulate for interrogation. However, the British Consulate acknowledged that his entire family was British citizens but denied that He Yongyi was a British citizen. Therefore, the police station escorted him to the First Special Court Criminal Division yesterday. Ru Baoyi, the police station's lawyer, explained the defendant's crimes and stated that after the incident, his brother contacted the plaintiffs and reached an agreement. They all requested that the court not pursue the matter. However, the police station believed that the defendant's crime was undoubtedly true, so they still filed a lawsuit with the court, but requested that a suspended sentence be granted at the time of judgment so that he could reform himself. When questioned, He Yongyi admitted to the continuous theft. Then his brother, He Yongqian, turned himself in, requesting a lenient sentence so that he could take him back to Hong Kong, strictly discipline him, and hire Yang Sicheng and Ye Shaoying as lawyers to appear in court, requesting a suspended sentence in accordance with Article 74 of the Criminal Law. After verifying the confession, Judge Feng Shide announced the judgment in court. He Yongyi was sentenced to eight months in prison for continuous theft, suspended for two years, and handed over to his brother He Yongqian for supervision.

### Old Man Repeatedly Extorted Money, Conviction Pronounced After Interrogation

Sentenced to Six Months in Prison, Suspended for Three Years

On June 17th of this year, Gu Xiaofu from Chongming was killed in a jealous fight over a woman on Touba Road, Hongkou. The murderer escaped without a trace. On the 1st of this month, Shi Yongfu, an old man from Chongming (61 years old) residing at No. 38 Touba Road, was cooling off in the China Garden on Suzhou Road when he met Hu Shaojiang (a boatman) from the same hometown. He said, "You are related to the Gu Xiaofu murder case. The police station is issuing warrants for your arrest. If you want to clear your name, you must give me 25 yuan, and I can prevent it. The deceased is my godson, and I will not pursue the matter. Otherwise, you will definitely be included as an accomplice." Hu Shaojiang was afraid that he would be framed and was extremely frightened. He raised 15 yuan on the 3rd and gave it to his home to avoid being identified as one of the murderers. Unexpectedly, after receiving the money, Shi Yongfu met Hu again on the road the day before yesterday and said, "You must give me another 10 yuan to settle the matter. Walking around Touba Road in Hongkou, I guarantee you will be safe." He was invited to Tianxing Laohuzao at No. 217 Tiantong Road to pay the remaining amount. Hu then realized that he was extorting money under false pretenses and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Detective Tang Guangfu was dispatched and marked a 10-yuan Chinese farmer banknote in secret and went to deliver it at the appointed time. After Shi Yongfu accepted it, he saw the detectives arrive and threw the banknote on the ground to escape, but was still arrested and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court Criminal Division III. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, explained the case and requested an investigation. Then, according to Hu Shaojiang's testimony, the defendant extorted money under false pretenses, defrauding him of 15 yuan, and was still not satisfied, so he reported it to the police station to arrest him. According to Detective Tang's report on the arrest of the defendant, he presented a 10-yuan banknote as evidence. When questioned, the defendant confessed, "The deceased Gu Xiaofu is my godson, and the plaintiff Hu Shaojiang both worshiped a 'Lao Tou Zi', so they are brothers from the same industry. That day, I knew that the murderer Wang Laolin invited him to drink, and the plaintiff was also present, so I scolded him and slapped him twice. I did not receive 15 yuan." The remaining testimony was denied. Judge Xiao Xie fen sentenced Shi Yongfu to six months in prison, suspended for three years.

### Case of Person from Guan Nong Injuring Store Owner's Wife

Private Lawsuit Settled Through Mediation; Public Lawsuit Resulted in Fine of One Hundred Yuan

Lu Zhou, the Suzhou wife of the owner of the Yuanxing Fruit Shop at No. 298 Fada Road, was attacked a few days ago by Ouyang Qinghua, a person from Ningbo from Guan Nong in Jianli, behind the shop. In anger, he rushed into the shop from the back door with a knife and slashed her head, arms, and other places four times. The shop assistants subdued the assailant and called the police for arrest. The police sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment and escorted the assailant to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention, awaiting the victim's recovery for further interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is learned that the cause of the incident was that the Yuanxing Fruit Shop has been prosperous in recent years, with crowded goods and a cramped shop. There is no place to store them. There is a vacant house at No. 4 in Jianli, behind the shop, which is owned by the Catholic Church. Lu Zhou, the wife of the owner of the Yuanxing Fruit Shop, discussed the matter with Ouyang Qinghua from Guan Nong in Jianli, asking to temporarily borrow it to store goods. If someone comes to rent it, they can move out at any time. Ouyang replied that the authority rested with the landlord's agent, the Zhou family who collected the rent, and they should contact the Zhou family. Ms. Lu then entrusted Ouyang to discuss the matter with the Zhou family, who agreed to temporarily lend the vacant house No. 4 to Yuanxing to store goods, and Yuanxing would send a monthly remuneration. For several months, they lived in peace. Unexpectedly, the main landlord, the Catholic Church, learned of this recently and investigated the Guan Nong people for privately lending out the vacant house for profit. Ouyang immediately notified Yuanxing to quickly move out the stored goods, but Yuanxing requested a postponement because it was impossible to move so many goods at once, causing a conflict. Later, Ouyang was unable to reply to the landlord, and in anger, he slashed Yuanxing's wife, Lu Zhou, with a knife to vent his anger. Now, in the private lawsuit, the assailant Ouyang's family has asked people to earnestly discuss a settlement with Lu Zhou, paying compensation for medical expenses and losses, and publishing an apology in the newspaper. In the public lawsuit, Lawyer Jin of the police force filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court on the charge of injury. After the trial, the verdict was announced the day before yesterday that Ouyang Qinghua injured a person and was fined 100 yuan as a warning.

### Hurricane Reaches Japan, Huangpu River High Tide

Temperature at Ninety-Four Point Six Degrees, Oppressive Heat

The Pacific hurricane landed on Kyushu Island in Japan yesterday. At the same time, the temperature in this city rose again, and the Huangpu River experienced another high tide. The situation is recorded separately as follows:

Hurricane Reaches Japan

The hurricane originating near Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean initially headed northwest, causing the southeastern coast of China to be in danger of being hit for a time. Then it suddenly turned due north, showing a tendency to approach the Ryukyu Islands. This was not the case, and the wind direction turned north-northeast and continued to advance in this direction without changing. It finally reached 22 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM yesterday. Checking its position, it has landed on Kyushu Island in Japan.

Oppressive Heat

Although the hurricane landed on Kyushu Island, it is not known whether the landing site is a prosperous or remote area, so it is impossible to guess whether there will be any impact. However, since the hurricane has landed, its force will naturally weaken, and it will soon disappear, needless to say. According to the astronomical observatory, the highest temperature in this city before 3:00 PM yesterday was 94.6 degrees, and the heat wave once again invaded Shanghai, making it extremely oppressive.

Sudden High Tide

Also, around 3:00 PM yesterday, a sudden high tide occurred in the Huangpu River and then receded. The Huangpu Bureau predicted a figure of 10 feet and 5 inches, causing the New-New Company side on Guangxi Road, the China Business Company on Sichuan Road, and the Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road to experience backflow from the sewers, causing waterlogging. However, yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the Huangpu Bureau was not working, so the actual amount could not be recorded. It is estimated that it must have been above 12 feet.

When she was 50 yards east of Muer Duck Road, she suddenly knocked down a boy, Xu Binggen (7 years old, from Changshu), who was walking on the road, causing serious injuries. The woman sent the child to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and ordered detectives to investigate. The child's condition deteriorated at 12:20 AM on the previous morning. Rescue was ineffective, and he died. The body was taken to the Feilun Road autopsy station. Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special Court, arrived at the station yesterday morning to examine the body. After confirming the identity of the family, he instructed the father, Xu Furong, to claim the body for burial.

The main points of the lawsuit stated that the defendant, Shou Kangzhi, operated the Dafengchang Cigarette Paper Shop and distributed tickets for the New-New Company rooftop garden. Last month, the defendant ordered his employees Shen and Chen to sell 4,687 of the above tickets to the plaintiffs for sale at their stores. They immediately paid 290 yuan and 57 cents in national currency. It was only later discovered that these tickets were all forged. After the plaintiffs reported this to the police, the defendant was arrested, but no public prosecution was filed. The defendant's actions constitute crimes under Articles 203 and 339 of the Criminal Code. In addition to requesting that the defendant be summoned for punishment in accordance with the law, they also request a judgment ordering the defendant to compensate for damages of 290 yuan and 57 cents in national currency. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai presided over the hearing in Criminal Division II, and the defendant hired lawyer Sun Zuji to appear in court to defend him. After the interrogation was completed, the court scheduled a date for announcing the verdict on the morning of the 28th.

### American Woman, Smith, Captures a White Bear in Sichuan

The white bear is a specialty of northwestern Sichuan Province. Ms. Smith is waiting for a price to sell it to a museum.

Recently, the French ship "Andre Huang Peng" sailed from Shanghai to Marseille. Among the passengers was an American woman named Smith, who was carrying a white bear and several other birds and animals. This white bear is a specialty of northwestern Sichuan Province and can only be found in bamboo forests, because this animal only eats bamboo. Therefore, it is very rare and precious. Last year, Mrs. Harkness acquired a small bear in Sichuan that was only a few months old. Later, in winter, she shipped it from Shanghai to New York and sold it to a museum for a huge price. This time, Ms. Smith captured one male and one female. The male weighed 300 pounds and died of illness on the way down the Yangtze River. The existing female weighs 200 pounds. After Ms. Smith arrived in Shanghai, she kept it a secret to avoid the trouble of people in Shanghai asking to see it. Although this animal usually eats bamboo, Ms. Smith has discovered that it also eats noodles, candies, and sugarcane, so there is no need to worry about food. As for after arriving in Marseille, she will either sell it to the British Museum or ship it to the United States for sale, which has not yet been determined. The price she can get is also yet to be decided. Ms. Smith plans to exhibit it in England before selling it, expecting to charge each visitor one shilling. If exhibited in the United States, she can charge each visitor 25 cents. The admission fees collected should be more than the selling price of the animal, it is said. Ms. Smith plans to return to China in the autumn of this year and go to Sichuan again to capture animals. Ms. Smith has lived in Sichuan for many years and has a lot of experience in capturing bears, so she will definitely be able to continue to capture more in the future.

### Yu Hede Cables to Request Payment of the Former Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Debts

Losses Suffered When the Railway Was Nationalized - The Method of Repayment Should Be Revised

Former Zhejiang Railway representative Yu Hede, at the request of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Debt Group representative, telegraphed to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan yesterday, (title omitted) The current Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was founded by the former Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Company. During the commercial operation period, the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou section and the Ningbo-Cao'e River section in Shaoxing had been opened to traffic. In the second year of the Republic of China, the northern government, disregarding the efforts of the merchants, nationalized the railway. All company shares were exchanged for securities, along with the original bonds issued by the Zhejiang Railway Company, to be repaid in installments. Apart from what has already been repaid, there are still outstanding principal and interest due in the final period, as well as unpaid amounts occupied by the Zhejiang Railway Company, totaling more than 1.58 million yuan. It was originally scheduled to be fully repaid by October of the seventh year of the Republic of China, but it was not paid by the due date and was delayed for as long as eighteen years. It was not until October of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, when the Ministry of Railways negotiated a loan with a banking syndicate to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, that discussions began on repayment. By May of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, when the banking syndicate loan was established, the ministry only allocated 800,000 yuan, which was handed over to the liquidation office of the two railways for proportional distribution according to the share capital and debt amounts. According to the calculation, the amount received was only half of the debt amount. The bondholders repeatedly argued with the ministry, but there was no result. When the railway was nationalized, Hede was the representative of the Zhejiang Railway and was well aware of the significant losses suffered by the merchants. Now, the repayment method set by the ministry saves very little for the government but causes significant losses for the merchants. For the sake of maintaining national credibility and alleviating the hardships of the people, it is necessary for the ministry to revise the repayment method. Now, according to the representatives of the debt group, they repeatedly request that justice be upheld. Hede, as it concerns his hometown, cannot shirk his responsibility. In addition to previously telegraphing to the ministry to make an appeal on their behalf, the representatives of the debt group have also submitted a detailed statement of reasons to the Executive Yuan and the ministry. I would like to implore Your Excellency to consider the merchants' initial efforts and the railway's prosperous operation. The small amount of several hundred thousand yuan is not difficult to raise. Please approve the Ministry of Railways to revise the repayment method so that all bondholders can be fully compensated, thereby upholding national credibility and alleviating the hardships of the merchants. Is this appropriate? I respectfully await your decision. Yu Hede respectfully bows.

### Person Wounded Escapes from Hospital and Dies - Head Nurse and Others Summoned for Questioning

Doctor on Duty at the Hospital - Released on Bail of 500 Yuan

A guest named Hu Jinfu, over fifty years old, was slashed in the head in five places on Kangheng Road in southern Shanghai a few days ago. He was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by the West Gate Branch. Unexpectedly, Hu Jinfu died the day after arriving at the hospital in the Fengji Wharf area. Qin Defang, a local official from the 23rd district, reported to the local court, and Inspector He Jingcen declared that the death was due to injuries and filled out the household form, and a coffin was provided for burial. However, according to a report from Zhu Gonghong, the director of Shanghai Hospital, after the deceased arrived at the hospital, he refused to explain the cause of the attack and did not want to be treated in the hospital, escaping on his own, leading to his death. However, the West Gate Branch believes that when a person is dying, they will seek help to survive and would never willingly give up their life. They sent a medical investigator to investigate. According to reports, Shanghai Hospital requires all patients to pay ten yuan upon admission, as well as other miscellaneous fees, before they can receive treatment. Otherwise, they are refused. The deceased was turned away because he had no money and was then claimed to have escaped. The matter was reported to the General Bureau, which forwarded it to the inspector. If this is true, the hospital's lack of morality and disregard for human life make them indirectly responsible for the death. To determine whether this is the case, Inspector He specially ordered Chen Yongan, the head nurse of the hospital, the doctor on duty at the time, police officers from the West Gate Branch, and Qin Defang, a local official from the 23rd district, to appear in court for questioning yesterday (the 24th). It is rumored that the doctor paid a bail of 500 yuan pending further investigation.

### Song of Lugou Bridge

㊀

Now is the time!

Now is the poem!

Feed my horse,

Sharpen my weapon,

Rush forward,

Resist the enemy.

I only know the nation,

I don't know myself;

I only advance, never retreat,

Though I die, I will live on.

If we win,

I will build my camp at Lugou Bridge,

If we lose,

I will make Lugou Bridge my grave!

㊁

Now is the time!

Now is the time!

Use justice as the sharp point,

Use popular support as the backing,

Rush forward,

Resist the enemy.

Every inch of land,

Is an inch of gold;

Whoever wants to snatch it,

I will fight to the death.

If we win,

I will build my camp at Lugou Bridge,

If we lose,

I will make Lugou Bridge my grave?

### "What Do I Do?"

— Ge Chonglou

'The enemy wants to keep his plundered loot—the four northeastern provinces—and he also wants to send troops to North China to attack our abdomen; and we must not only defend North China, expel the enemy from the border of Hebei and Chahar, but also recover our lost territories in the four northeastern provinces; so this means fighting to the death, and it can be said that survival is at stake. However, the enemy is doing his best to plot against us, and we are doing our best to resist the enemy, so the victory or defeat of this war cannot be judged in a short time; in this period when the great war is opening, we must decide what responsibilities we should bear.

Excitement, shouts, arguments... these are all useless, we should all ask ourselves: 'What do I do?' Destroying one's family to relieve the country's difficulties is of course the most enthusiastic expression; however, small forces should not be despised, such as the work of sharpening a large knife, be sure to do our best, choose strengths to contribute, so that power is not wasted, and anti-warfare is truly beneficial, and then we can hope for the final victory.

In short: except for traitors, everyone must do their best and stay out of the matter! (Transfer remuneration to national defense donations)

### Young Woman Feng Wanzhen

— Ru Hui

In the vicinity of Beiping. Less than ten li from the Summer Palace, is the Xie Village region. Seen from here, one can vaguely make out the ancient city of Beiping, a black and沉沉 unfolding on the skyline. The village’s perimeter still has some trees, in the yellow, sandy north, such a village boasts worthy scenery.

One day at dusk, Xie Village residents from afar witnessed flames rising from Beiping city, along with barely audible cannon fire. The next morning, people seeking refuge in the countryside reported: “The Summer Palace was burned by foreign devils, the Wen Zong Emperor escaped to Rehe, several places in the capital city were also attacked by gunfire…”

Upon hearing this, the village’s people realized that trouble had erupted. A husky man dressed like a hunter even more so, was filled with anger; he turned to that strange man and asked:

“What about the officers? Aren’t they moving to kill the devil soldiers?”

The traveler from the capital city turned his head, “Officers?” He let out a grunt from his nostrils. Afterwards, with a very grief-stricken attitude, he stated: “They only help the foreign devils to rob the common people, the foreign devils rob on the east, they rob on the west, the foreign devils rob on the west, they rob on the east!”

“These officers…” the husky man did not shout out “scoundrel.”

“Aren’t very officer-like.” The guest finished harshly, and picked up a load of sundries along with his family and left.

“Brother Sanbao, we must also defend ourselves.” A young man said.

The husky man nodded. He was actually the village chief of this village, named Feng, and called Sanbao. His ancestors were from Shandong, and his burly frame revealed the valor and strength of northerners. Under his leadership, the people of this village survived by hunting.

One day passed, and as expected several dozen western soldiers seeking to desert secretly approached Xie Village, Sanbao impolitely led all of the village’s hunters and bravely resisted the enemy, in contact akin to a skirmish. The villagers relied on the village for cover. Although only several dozen hunting rifles, they still repelled the western soldiers, and even killed several of them from a distance. This small victory greatly excited everyone. The entire village was filled with lively and happy air. That night, a feast was laid out at Sanbao’s home, Sanbao’s face was full of smiles, and he engaged in impassioned discussions with the village comrades who had participated in the battle. They said: “If the officers in the capital city also had this kind of ability, the emperor wouldn’t need to go to Rehe.”

At this lively banquet, only Sanbao’s daughter Wanzhen sat alone, cheerless with knitted brows. She sat beside her father, neither drinking nor conversing.

“Wanzhen, you are sitting there blankly, is something bothering you?” Finally, her father opened his mouth and asked. Everyone also turned their astonished gazes to her.

“Father,” Wanzhen said worriedly: “Now it seems that we have won, but if a small enemy leaves, a large enemy may arrive soon.”

“But we still have guns and bullets…” a young hunter said unconcernedly.

“However,” she continued: “If the western soldiers use cannons to bombard us, won’t this Xie Village instantly turn to ashes? How can I not be anxious?”

“Ah! Cannons?” Everyone froze as if struck by lightning, the wine cups they were holding, the chopsticks they were gripping, remained suspended in the air, and they stared wide-eyed at each other. The brave men present were clearly startled by the premonition of Xie Village’s painful end as “flying ash.” The dark shadow of the cannons pressed down on everyone at the table, making it hard to breathe; after a considerable silence, Sanbao stammered and opened his mouth:

“Wanzhen’s words, sound like they aren’t nonsense, everyone should think of a way. Everyone…”

Everyone’s throats went dry, and they quietly looked at each other. Sanbao, as cautiously as searching for wild game, carefully scrutinized each guest’s face for a while. His eyes, filled with disappointment, finally landed on Wanzhen, but she opened her mouth composedly:

“Father, elders, I have heard that western soldiers are skilled in fighting with firearms, but are unaccustomed to martial arts. The advantage of firearms is long-range attacks, the advantage of martial arts is close combat. Let’s use our strength in martial arts to attack their weakness in firearms, relying on fortune, perhaps we can avoid this crisis – what do you all think?”

The hunters started to discuss in a flurry, some nodding, some shaking their heads, some debating the comparison between firearms and knives, some talking about their experiences with martial arts. Sanbao also thought for a while, but he felt that close combat was not an easy way to win: the thought of grappling face-to-face with foreign devils made his heart turn cold, so he was unwilling to listen to his daughter’s words, but he couldn’t think of a better way than his daughter’s.

Wanzhen left the banquet, sighing at Xie Village’s ill-fated fortune, but she resolved to save the entire village and protect her elderly father. That night, she summoned the village’s most skilled martial artists, and she said to them with慷慨激昂:

“Do you all know the danger our village is in? Do you all know the danger we ourselves are in? The smashing of the village is as precarious as a pile of eggs, and our demise is also like morning dew. Rather than sitting and waiting to die, it would be better to fight to the death with the enemy soldiers. Now I have decided to go and engage in close combat with the western soldiers, regardless of life or death. If you have the courage, please follow me!” She cast a firm gaze around at the young men and asked: “Who dares to go with me?”

The young men usually admired Wanzhen, and were also moved by her seriousness and courage, so they yelled out “Good!” with a thunderous sound.

The heroine said happily: “With us so enthusiastic, Xie Village will certainly be spared from劫难.”

After preparations were finalized, they were all dressed in black with white blades, the youth’s heroism stirred the heart of chivalry, a group of fifty-odd people, following Wanzhen quietly set out under the starlight. The hunter’s skill, was as swift as a monkey. Four 里 from the village was a dense wood, the lane in the wood was the path the western soldiers were sure to take, Wanzhen directed the youths to ambush on both sides of the lane, quietly waiting for the western soldiers to arrive.

Before long, a team of western soldiers came with cannons. They were just about to calmly arrange to fire the cannons. Suddenly, a deafening cry was heard, the ambushers jumped out from all sides, rushing straight at the enemy, at the fall of a hand and rise of a blade, several fell. The western soldiers were caught off guard, and for a moment lost the ability to resist, each of Xie Village’s youth embraced a resolve to kill the enemy, and they had also received martial arts training. They sent these pitiful western soldiers, capable of nothing more than disturbing each other, fleeing helter-skelter. Wanzhen was like a fierce tiger bursting into a flock of sheep, brandishing two knives, fighting with all her strength, unleashing her full abilities, all that the blade reached had their heads smashed and blood flowing.

In the midst of the chaotic battle, the western soldiers retreated in defeat. She again led the crowd in pursuit, so that they were unable to fire cannons. As dawn approached, only ten-odd enemy soldiers remained, abandoning their cannons and fleeing in a panic. This sharp lesson made the enemy soldiers dare not come again. Xie Village’s life and property was preserved in the hands of a nineteen-year-old young woman.

This is a story from the tenth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, when the Anglo-French Allied Forces captured Beijing. Today, reading about Feng Wanzhen’s defeat of the enemy, and feeling sorrow and indignation at the death of the main general buried in the pile of bayonets and gunpowder, seeking peace, is unbearable. We must not become accustomed to the old method of “defeating” [the enemy], and the old essays of “swearing to death.” Not to mention “retreating?” Author
