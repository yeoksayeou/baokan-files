### Enemy's Sea, Land, and Air Forces Launch Major Counter-Offensive; Our Forces Meet Them Head-On, Achieving Victories on All Fronts

The enemy abandoned both East and West Command Headquarters yesterday. Cruisers and submarines were hit and destroyed by our fire. The Izumo warship was damaged yesterday and quietly redeployed.

As a result of continuous battles between Chinese and Japanese armies, the enemy suffered a disastrous defeat and heavy losses. They resorted to fiercely defending the eastern district's positions while requesting reinforcements, hoping to launch a major counter-offensive. Therefore, after the Kurume Division arrived, they mobilized their sea, land, and air forces yesterday morning to launch a full-scale attack on our various positions. However, our side was well-prepared, and both air and ground forces were dispatched simultaneously to meet them head-on with a severe blow. The enemy forces still failed, suffered significant damage, and retreated in disarray. They also abandoned the Jiangwan Road and Gonda Cotton Mill command headquarters. Our army seized the opportunity to advance and occupied Hongkou Park. The enemy's frontline fell into an increasingly desperate situation, attempting to land in the Wusong and Pudong areas. However, this attempt was unsuccessful, and two cruisers were destroyed by our artillery fire. Furthermore, our air force destroyed a submarine outside the Wusongkou area. The Japanese police station and the postal company were also hit by our bombs, affecting the Japanese consulate and causing numerous casualties among enemy soldiers and civilians. Although enemy planes were dispatched throughout the day yesterday, hoping to cause damage to our side, they were suppressed by our air force and anti-aircraft guns. In particular, the flagship Izumo was damaged last night after breaking through our (censored) and quietly redeployed. The details of yesterday's battle situation are recorded separately below.

The Enemy Has Abandoned Two Command Headquarters

At dawn yesterday, while the enemy's reinforcement forces had not yet solidified their positions, our forces launched simultaneous attacks from all directions. Gunfire and artillery shells rained down like raindrops. Our soldiers fought bravely with bayonets, advancing without retreating. The remaining enemy resisted stubbornly, but all sides were unable to withstand the attacks and collapsed. At 8:15 AM, the soldiers desperately defending the enemy's headquarters at the Gonda Cotton Mill in the eastern part of Shanghai could not hold on and retreated. They are now using the Yu Feng Cotton Mill as a base, planning to resist again. Our army crossed the Gonda Cotton Mill, advancing forward, and dispatched teams to search the enemy's headquarters. In the Yinxiang District, the enemy had reached the south of Hejian Road. In Hongkou, after our army occupied Hongkou Park, the Patriotic Girls' School, and Yu Qing Middle School, they aimed and bombarded the enemy's headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. The enemy, with its forces isolated and weak, was forced to abandon it and retreat to Dixiwei Road, using the Japanese elementary school as a base. In the western part of Shanghai, after the enemy abandoned the Toyota Cotton Mill, they originally used the Inner and Outer Cotton Mills as a base. Yesterday, they also abandoned this and retreated south of the factory. It is reported that the enemy's death toll on all fronts was about several hundred, with corpses scattered everywhere and heavy casualties.

Furthermore, according to reliable information, the enemy's headquarters on North Sichuan Road has moved to the Japanese elementary school on Dixiwei Road. However, a small number of remaining enemy soldiers are still desperately defending the area, and our army is currently surrounding it but has not yet occupied it.

The Japanese-owned Gonda Cotton Mill, located at the end of Yangshupu Bridge's Jungong Road, was originally the enemy's eastern district base. It has been under relentless attack by our right-wing army for days, with bombing assistance from our air force. The enemy's casualties have been heavy, and almost all the factory buildings have been destroyed. It is difficult for the enemy forces there to find cover. Therefore, the enemy forces at the factory withdrew around 2:00 PM yesterday, and the remaining enemy retreated to Pingliang Road and Yangshupu, it is said.

We Achieved a Surprise Victory at Bazihqiao

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Before the outbreak of the war, Bazihqiao in Zhabei was originally occupied by a large enemy detachment. Since the start of the war, our army, in order to easily establish close contact with the eastern part of Shanghai and to coordinate with the Baoshan Road area, with the aim of encircling the enemy's headquarters from three sides, Bazihqiao became a must-seize location. It was necessary to quickly occupy the position. Therefore, at dawn on the 15th, our army had already captured it and occupied the area near the bridge. Although the enemy had counterattacked several times, they were all repelled. At dawn yesterday, the enemy again concentrated armored vehicles to cover infantry and gathered firepower to launch a fierce counterattack on our position. Our army immediately responded and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's position from two directions. The two sides engaged in a bayonet fight for two hours. The enemy finally collapsed and retreated in panic. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and occupied the Japanese elementary school in the area.

At dawn yesterday, our army on Jiangwan Road, coordinating with the troops on Baoshan Road and Bazihqiao, launched a fierce attack on the enemy near the Sports Association Road and the Patriotic Girls' School. After more than four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy collapsed and retreated. Around 9:00 AM, our army occupied the position. Our army on Baoshan Road and Bazihqiao also advanced to the front of the Tiantong'an Railway Station at that time. Therefore, the enemy's headquarters at the end of Jiangwan Road and the enemy in Hongkou Park were heavily surrounded by our army. The buildings surrounding the enemy's headquarters were all destroyed by our artillery fire. Because the building was sturdy and the walls were surrounded by steel plates, the enemy still occupied and resisted. According to a military source in the evening, the enemy forces there gradually retreated to the Dixiwei Road area, and the enemy's headquarters on Jiangwan Road could be occupied by our army at any time, it is said.

The Enemy's Position is About to Fall into a Desperate Situation

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to observations published by a foreign military expert, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai, the Chinese army adopted a large encirclement strategy, advancing without retreating. The future is quite optimistic. However, the Japanese army has been forced into a triangular front, with the Gonda Cotton Mill in the east, the Jiangwan Road headquarters in the north, and the Izumo flagship in the south. The northern route has been surrounded, becoming a protruding point. (Note: A protruding position is most dreaded in strategy. Its narrowest point is only the range of a rifle, and there is a possibility of being cut off by the Chinese army.) The southern point, the Izumo flagship, only serves to cover the northeast lines and has no resistance. Judging from this, the Japanese army seems to be in a desperate situation.

Our Army Occupied Hongkou Park

Yesterday (16th) morning, our army on Jiangwan Road attacked the enemy's position with machine guns and rifles, charging repeatedly. At noon, they defeated the remaining enemy and occupied Hongkou Park, the Patriotic Girls' School, Yu Qing Middle School, and other places. They are now approaching the enemy's headquarters and are opportunistically attacking. On that night, the enemy suffered more than a hundred casualties, and we also suffered some casualties. At dawn yesterday morning, a certain unit of our army, under orders, set out from the Special Vocational College on Shuidaian Road and advanced towards the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road. About half a li northwest of the Patriotic Girls' School, there was a tall building. The enemy jumped out to resist, firing machine guns in a fierce attack. Our army fought bravely and returned fire, finally repelling the enemy and occupying the Patriotic Girls' School, completing the plan to encircle the enemy's Marine Corps headquarters. From here eastward, contact has been made with our army.

Yesterday (16th) at 2:00 AM, fierce fighting broke out again. The enemy attempted a night attack on the Jiangwan area, using a large detachment of about three to four hundred men, under the cover of their artillery. Our army immediately rose up to fight back, using machine guns and grenades to calmly respond. They surrounded the entire enemy force. As a result of the fierce battle, all the enemy soldiers in this unit were annihilated by us.

Two Armored Vehicles Captured on Guangdong Street

Enemy Attempt to Attack the North Railway Station Blocked

Yesterday morning, a team of Japanese soldiers moved west from North Sichuan Road and Bazi Road, attempting to outflank our army's position on Baoshan Road. They were stopped by American soldiers stationed in the area around Bazi Road and North Henan Road. It is reported that there was a minor conflict at the time, and the Japanese army retreated immediately, resolving the situation.

Enemy Attempts to Land at Liuhe

Military sources say that Japanese reinforcements arrived at Songkou yesterday morning. Because our air force carried out fierce and intense bombings, posing a major threat to the enemy, the enemy's reinforcements ultimately failed to land in the concession area. It is now known that the enemy's left wing has changed its strategy, deciding to send reinforcements to the Yanglinkou and Liuhe Jiangmian areas, attempting to repeat the old trick of the January 28th Shanghai War, launching a large-scale attack there to attack our hinterland. However, our side was already aware of their treacherous plot, so the defense was prepared early. Once they attack, we will resolutely annihilate them in one fell swoop.

Enemy Landing at Wusong Unsuccessful

At 0:30 AM on the 16th, Japanese warships anchored in the Sanxia Water, taking advantage of the pre-dawn darkness, had a large number of marines loaded into dozens of rowing boats, hoping to land along the Waimalu Ferry Pier on the Wusong Outer Bund. The enemy warships used artillery to cover them. After our stationed troops opened fire with machine guns, a fierce battle ensued for more than an hour. The enemy failed and retreated towards the sea. At that time, our air force had arrived after hearing the alarm, so they flew to the Sanxia Water to bomb the enemy warships, firing anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. Our artillery also fired from the shore to assist in the battle. The sound of artillery was deafening and extremely fierce. After 9:00 AM, the fighting gradually subsided. Several artillery shells landed in the eastern half of Wusong Town, and more than 600 residents were in urgent need of rescue. It is feared that a large-scale sea, land, and air battle will unfold at Songkou from now on.

Enemy Reinforcements Arrived, Attempting to Counterattack

Reliable sources say that the Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa and the Eleventh Fleet Commander Tanemoto had requested reinforcements from Tokyo. Part of the Kurume Division that arrived yesterday was the two divisions that departed from Sasebo on the 13th. Part of it landed at the Osaka pier to join the battle. The exact number of people is unknown because there is no accurate estimate. Our front line has now been continuously reinforced with large troops, and they are waiting in strict formation.

Japanese Warships Bombarding the City Center

According to a foreigner who arrived in Shanghai yesterday on a foreign ship, after he boarded the ship and arrived at Wusongkou, he changed to a small wheel, protected by armed foreign police, and drove into the Pujiang River.

Lianglu's New House Suffered Heavy Damage

Japan has provoked on many sides in Shanghai this time. Since the start of the war, they have launched simultaneous attacks by sea, land, and air, and have not succeeded after three days of fierce fighting. They have adopted the old trick of the January 28th Incident, specializing in bombarding our positions with artillery and destroying our cultural institutions. The Hujiang University in Binjiang, the eastern district, has been completely destroyed. Our new house of Lianglu Bureau at the intersection of Baoshan Road, which was completed less than two years ago and cost 700,000 yuan, has been severely damaged by the enemy's bombardment in recent days.

All Eyes on Bombing the Izumo

Around 9:00 PM last night, a loud noise suddenly came from the river, resounding through the sky, shaking the earth. The buildings near the Bund were shaken very violently. After investigation, it was our side who launched a certain explosive device to bomb the enemy warship Izumo. Because the ship was surrounded by defensive torpedo nets, it was not hit, which is a pity. At that time, the enemy warships in the Huangpu River, in a panic, used sea searchlights to illuminate our Pudong area. At the same time, they fired artillery shells at our army's position in Pudong. Our army also returned fire with heavy artillery and machine guns. The fierce battle between the two sides was quite intense. At 10:30 PM, the sound of artillery became denser, and the roofs were shaken. The sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of beads, and the light of artillery fire was like lightning.

He commanded soldiers to resist the enemy in the northern Shanghai war zone a few days ago. He led his troops from the front, bravely advancing as a vanguard, resulting in being hit by enemy gunfire, injuring his right lung in the chest. He fell on the battlefield and was rescued by our Chinese Red Cross rescue team and sent to the Chinese Red Cross Rescue Committee's Second Wounded Soldiers Hospital at the Lusi Primary School on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession. Due to the severity of his injuries, doctors tried their best to treat him but were unable to save him. He died at 11:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the Tongren Fuyuan Branch, which provided the company commander's body with a high-quality coffin and shroud and temporarily buried it in the cemetery. It will be claimed by his family after the war is over.

### Japanese Planes Attack Nanjing Again Yesterday, Unsuccessfully

Repelled Five Times by Our Air Force * Eight Japanese Planes Shot Down in Jurong and Sujia Areas * Capital's Air Defense Consolidated, Remains Tranquil

[Nanjing] Today, enemy planes attacked five times throughout the day. The first time was at 6:00 AM. At that time, our side had already received the alert. The capital's police and defense forces immediately mobilized and were on guard in all directions. Based on their experience, they were unusually calm and quick in their actions. At the same time, our air force also mobilized and attacked the enemy planes in the suburbs. An aerial battle took place in the suburbs of the capital. Before long, the enemy planes were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. They returned shortly after, but were ultimately unsuccessful. Until noon, the enemy planes launched a full-scale attack, but were still heavily damaged by our air force and fled in panic. The capital city remained tranquil throughout. Even when the enemy planes attacked most fiercely, residents in the city only faintly heard the sound of our army's anti-aircraft guns from the suburbs. In the evening, confirmed reports were received from various locations, indicating that a total of five enemy planes had been destroyed by our air force and had fallen in Jurong, Yangzhou, Suzhou, Yixing, and Danyang. (16th Dispatch)

[Nanjing] On the 16th, Japanese planes attempted to attack the capital four more times, but were repelled midway by our air force. A total of eight enemy planes were shot down in Jurong and other places. The first time was at 8:40 AM. Upon receiving the report, our army immediately dispatched planes to engage the enemy. They encountered the enemy over Jiaxing and engaged in a fierce battle. As a result, two enemy heavy bombers were shot down by our side, with no damage to our own. The second time was at 9:30 AM, when two groups of enemy planes, totaling twenty-two, flew towards Nanjing from both sides of Taihu Lake. The first group of six planes was intercepted over Jurong, with three of them shot down, all of which were heavy bombers. Two of them fell and caught fire in the suburbs of Jurong, while one fell by the river. Our planes safely regrouped and returned at 10:30 AM. The second group was met by our large forces over Danyang, and the enemy planes fled in panic. The third time was at around 11:00 AM, when six enemy planes, flying from east to west along the north bank of the Yangtze River, attempted to attack Nanjing. After receiving the report, our side dispatched planes to emerge from the clouds over Zhenjiang. When the enemy planes flew through the area, our side immediately pursued and shot down one enemy plane near Zhenjiang and two enemy planes in the suburbs of Yangzhou, all of which were light bombers. After suffering a disastrous defeat, the enemy planes scattered and fled, failing to even glimpse the capital. At the same time, it was reported that enemy planes attacked us in large formations of twenty-five. Determined to prevent the enemy planes from reaching the skies above the capital, our side dispatched many planes to patrol around Nanjing. The enemy, having had more than twenty of their bombers destroyed by us in recent days, were timid and fearful. Upon seeing our large forces engaging, they scattered in confusion and retreated. The last time was at 3:10 PM, when many enemy fighter planes were spotted attacking from the southeast of Nanjing. Our side also dispatched many planes to search and deploy, preparing with appropriate thoroughness and occupying an absolute advantage in the air. Knowing that they would not succeed, the enemy fled, and we did not pursue them relentlessly. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Six enemy planes attacked us on the morning of the 16th. Our side received the information very early and issued an emergency alarm at 9:45 AM. The air force also took off and engaged in a fierce attack. The enemy planes were heavily suppressed and were unable to fly close to the skies above Nanjing. They were pursued and strafed by our planes in the Jurong area. Ground forces also fired anti-aircraft guns, shooting down one plane at 10:45 AM, which caught fire upon landing. At 10:50 AM, another plane was shot down. The remaining three enemy planes fled in panic. At 11:20 AM, enemy planes attacked again. As of the time of dispatch, both sides were still engaged in fierce combat. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] On the 15th, sixteen Japanese planes attacked the capital but were bravely resisted by our air force, which shot down six planes between Dajiaochang and Jurong. The British Ambassador, along with Military Attaché Lord Faversham, Secretary Gage, and Tian Bolie, the Nanjing correspondent for the British Manchester Guardian, drove to Jurong to inspect the wreckage on the afternoon of the 16th. Due to time constraints, they only inspected two destroyed planes before returning. According to them, they personally saw seven fallen Japanese pilots next to the wreckage, whose bodies were all equipped with safety parachutes. Another Japanese plane was shot down 200 yards away, with the remains of a Japanese pilot also found next to the plane. According to their observations, the Japanese planes were clearly shot down by Chinese planes. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Around 6:00 AM, several of our planes went to intercept and fiercely attack, reaching Danyang and encountering the enemy planes, beginning a battle. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy planes were repelled by us. At 7:00 AM, the alarm was lifted in Nanjing, and things returned to normal. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Baoding] The enemy plane that was shot down over Baoding and crashed in Xiong County a few days ago was transported to Baoding on the 16th. The plane is a single-wing light bomber. Due to transportation reasons, it has now been dismantled. Despite the heavy rain on the 16th, residents of Baoding braved the rain to see our spoils of war, causing traffic congestion. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

(16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

(Local News) According to military sources, Japanese heavy bombers flew to Nanjing several times yesterday, hoping to bomb the city. Our side was prepared, and before they could approach the capital, anti-aircraft guns and machine guns fired fiercely at the enemy planes. At the same time, a large number of our country's air force mobilized and responded calmly. The fighting between the two sides was very fierce. Under the attack from all sides, the enemy planes were unable to withstand it and were shot down by our army in succession, totaling six planes. Three fell in Jurong, two of which have been destroyed, two in Yangzhou, and one in Zhenjiang. According to another report, a total of ten planes were shot down. Nanjing has been extremely strict with air defense preparations, so enemy planes have repeatedly tried to bomb the city but have ultimately failed. The air raid alarm was in effect from 5:30 AM until 6:00 PM.

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters

Hidemasa's Withdrawal Does Not Mean Severing Diplomatic Relations

[Tokyo] On the afternoon of the 16th, when asked by foreign reporters whether Hidemasa's withdrawal from Nanjing meant the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson replied that it did not mean the severance of diplomatic relations. The Japanese government has not asked the Chinese ambassador to Japan to return home, nor has it heard of any move by the Chinese ambassador to return home voluntarily. When asked whether US Secretary of State Hull had proposed not to use Shanghai as a battlefield, the spokesperson replied that the US ambassador to Japan had not made such a proposal to the Foreign Ministry. When asked about the proposal to neutralize Shanghai, the spokesperson replied that the British acting ambassador to Japan, Shade, had mentioned it when he visited Hirota, but had not made any concrete proposals. At that time, the situation in Shanghai was not as critical as it is now. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### The British Manchester Guardian Criticizes the Bombing of Shanghai

Says Foreign Governments Should Protest to Japan

[London] Today's editorial in the Manchester Guardian criticized the bombing of Shanghai. Comparing London to Shanghai, it said that if a British pilot were to shoot at an enemy warship anchored on the Thames River from a high altitude in strong winds, it would be very easy to accidentally hit the buildings next to the river. This is especially true if the driver's skills are poor or the nerves are too excited. Foreign governments should protest to Japan, because Japan is the aggressor, forcing the Chinese to use any methods available to defend their country. If one is arguing for justice, it would be appropriate to order the Japanese to move their warships downstream, but the destruction found in Shanghai could not be avoided by requesting either side. The cases of Guernica in Spain, Tianjin and Shanghai in China, are all the same, demonstrating that destruction will never end until bombing is abolished. (Reuters, 16th Central News Agency)

### British Nationals, Women, and Children Prepare to Leave Shanghai

### Japanese National Shot, Evidence Found

Japanese Ammunition Discovered

[Qingdao] Regarding the shooting of two Japanese nationals here, citizens passing by at the time all witnessed the shooter being a Japanese sailor. The injured were two Japanese men in plain clothes. However, the Japanese side immediately rushed the two men to the hospital, claiming two Japanese sailors, Hattori and Koremoto, were harmed by Chinese plainclothes officers. This was clearly a premeditated plan. On the evening of the 14th, both sides negotiated and investigated the truth. By the morning of the 15th, everything was peaceful. Five Japanese warships remain stationed in the rear harbor, ready to land at any time. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)

[Qingdao] Both sides are still investigating the truth of the Japanese shooting incident. Diplomatic channels have not been abandoned. On the evening of the 14th, the municipal government sent councilor Zhou Jiayan and section chief Xie Zuyuan to negotiate with the Japanese side and conduct an investigation. However, there were no witnesses or material evidence, so no results could be reported. The Japanese side drafted an investigation report, stating that the perpetrator was a Chinese person in plain clothes, riding a bicycle and wearing yellow clothing. Our side refused to sign because they had no concrete evidence. The two sides agreed to continue talks on the morning of the 15th. That night, both sides were on high alert, but no incidents occurred.

Shen handed over the bullet found by our police to Otori and Shimomura for examination. The two sides talked for half an hour, agreeing to continue the investigation and strive for a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. However, based on the current situation, it appears the Japanese side is still using delaying tactics, so the future developments are difficult to predict. While engaging in diplomatic negotiations, our side will naturally make the necessary preparations. It is reported that five Japanese warships are still docked, and an aircraft carrier is reportedly heading towards Qidao. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)

### Over Five Hundred Students from Beiping Head South to Ji'nan

Describing the Tragic Situation in Pingjin, Residing in Various Schools in Jinan

[Jinan] Over five hundred male and female university students from Beiping, after traveling by British ship from Tianjin to Yantai and Longkou, took cars to Weixian, and boarded the Jiaoji train, arriving in Jinan on the morning of the 15th. They were greeted by the Provincial Education Department and the Youth Association. At noon, the students sent three representatives to the Provincial Government to meet Chairman Han, reporting on their escape and requesting relief. The Education Department then selected accommodation, with the male students residing at Yuying High School and the female students at No. 1 High School. The situation was extremely dire. According to the student representatives, about two thousand students had fled from Beiping. Some have already gone to Nanjing and Shanghai. Since the 29th Army withdrew, a puppet organization was established in Beiping, maintaining order under the watchful eyes of the Japanese. Zhang Zizhong was long ago abandoned by the Japanese and resigned to go to Tianjin. It is rumored that he has been detained in the French Concession's Xinhua Building. There is also the so-called Yellow Society, an extremely pro-Japanese group that constantly distributes pamphlets with absurd language, even plotting to organize a puppet state in North China. The current Chief of Police of Beiping, Pan Yugui, is willingly a top-tier traitor, repeatedly stating that he will not protect the following four types of people: 1) the Blue Shirts Society, 2) Communists, 3) the cultural sector, 4) personnel affiliated with central government agencies. In addition to the arrest of Central News Agency branch personnel, they will also implement inspections of various schools and cultural institutions. Because of this, the university students had to risk escape. First, they took the Beining Railway to Tianjin. The director of the railway bureau is still Chen Juesheng. The situation along the road was extremely tragic. Armed Japanese soldiers on the train constantly conducted inspections with great arrogance. On both sides of the railway, crops about to ripen were forcibly cut down by the Japanese army to prevent the possibility of Chinese troops being hidden. Langfang and Huangshibo, among other places, have been reduced to rubble. After arriving in Tianjin, there were a large number of refugees in the French Concession. Fortunately, the British Concession had a reception center jointly established by the World Red Cross and the Kailuan Mining Company, providing refugees with food, lodging, and some travel expenses. Entering the Chinese-administered area involved a thorough inspection by the Japanese army. The first batch of students arriving in Jinan numbered 317, including over 30 female students. The second batch consisted of over 200 students, mostly from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Min University, Chaoyang University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Zhongda University, and students from other provinces who went to Beiping to take exams. Their ancestral homes were in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and the northeastern provinces. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)

Current Commentary

### Two Major Problems in Maintaining Order in Shanghai

— Liu

Unemployment and Food Supply

Since Shanghai became a war zone, people throughout the city have been carrying luggage, leading the old, and helping the young, all moving towards the area south of the Suzhou Creek, north of Min'guo Road and Xujiahui, and east of Zhongshan Road, which they consider relatively safe, as a place to entrust their lives and property. The lives and property of foreign nationals are also intertwined with those of our Chinese people. As a result of this sudden population density, not only is there a sudden shortage of accommodation, but also the supply and demand of all necessities of life has become unbalanced. Prices are high, and supply cannot meet demand. In addition, unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard and speculate, raising prices and extorting money. This has led to incidents of shops being robbed. Although this is the fault of the unscrupulous merchants themselves, it has a major impact on local order. Now that the war has begun, the Ministry of Finance, in order to stabilize the financial situation, has ordered the banks and money shops in the city to close for two days. Yesterday (the 15th), seven articles of the measures to stabilize finance during the emergency period were announced, restricting deposits and withdrawals, and operations could resume. However, due to the intensity of the war, banks and money shops need to find safer areas to operate, so closures have resumed. Due to the disruption of financing, Shanghai's industry and commerce cannot operate, and more and more businesses are closing. As a result, the number of unemployed people is increasing. Moreover, for every person who loses their job, an entire family loses their livelihood. This is a hidden concern for local order. The cost of living in Shanghai is high, wages are low, and the burden on individuals is great. How many people can save enough to prepare for emergencies, aside from daily expenses? Today, it is impossible to ensure that everyone has a job, but reducing the number of unemployed should be done. The longer the banks and money shops are closed, the greater the losses to the area and the more uneasy people become. Therefore: 1) Financial institutions should resume operations as soon as possible. Even if there are concerns about areas near danger, they should find safer (?) areas to operate as soon as possible. 2) Banks and money shops should quickly decide on any supplements to the measures to stabilize finance that they believe are necessary. 3) Industry and commerce should establish close ties with financial institutions as soon as possible to obtain financial assistance so that they can resume operations. Even if business is slow, they must do everything possible to maintain the minimum livelihood of their employees to reduce the severity of the unemployment problem. 4) Those who cannot stay in Shanghai should be assisted in contacting transportation agencies, and the entire municipal government should use its resources to organize the safest possible methods to send them back to their hometowns by land and sea. No one should be allowed to wander around Shanghai. In short, reducing the number of unemployed people in Shanghai by even one person will increase the area's safety by one point. This is the first point.

"Hunger breeds discontent." Except for a very few, no one wants to resort to desperate measures. However, since the outbreak of the Shanghai incident, grain prices have soared, and people are panicking as if they cannot survive. Why is this? Not long ago, newspapers unanimously believed that even if there was a war in Shanghai, there would be no shortage of food. We doubted this. Whenever there is stormy weather in Shanghai, the supply of grain is slightly reduced, and rice prices still rise. How much more so when a war breaks out? Everyone believes that the war will be prolonged. Wealthy families are hoarding in advance, while the poor can barely afford to eat. In this uneven situation, it is easy to cause unrest. What's more, grain merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate prices, hoarding and speculating, disregarding the difficulty people have obtaining food and thinking that closing their doors can ensure safety. What good will this do when starving people swarm in? The current situation is not due to a shortage of food, but to uneven distribution and poor management. Earlier, this newspaper reported that there were over 450,000 bags of rice in storage in Shanghai. Those responsible were smug, considering this clear evidence of an ample food supply. However, this reporter was concerned because the stored rice was distributed in warehouses in Pudong and western-style warehouses. If transportation on the Huangpu River is disrupted, how will the rice be supplied? Then having rice would be like having no rice. As for how high rice prices in Anhui and Jiangxi are, that is a distant water that cannot put out a nearby fire and has nothing to do with the current food situation in Shanghai. The most important thing for the people of Shanghai today is how to solve the current and future food problems. This should be done by seeking practical solutions, not by empty talk.

Simply put: 1) The food problem in Shanghai today is a holistic problem. Therefore, it should be the joint responsibility of the municipal government and the authorities of the two concessions, and they should work together within an organized structure to deal with it. 2) First, make the best use of Shanghai's stored grain. Invite those in the industry to conduct a detailed survey and statistical analysis, and find ways to remove it from the various storage facilities and store it in safer places that are easy to distribute. 3) Strictly crack down on grain merchants raising prices. Place the assessment of grain prices under joint management. 4) Divide the city into several locations to provide subsidized grain to maintain the food supply for ordinary people. There should be many locations. 5) Find ways to protect rice merchants or ships transporting rice to Shanghai, or even have the government prepare funds to directly purchase and transport rice from various producing areas to Shanghai. 6) Persuade households and shops not to hoard too much food. Everyone should have a spirit of mutual assistance in times of crisis. The public must be able to eat before one's own food can be guaranteed. 7) Strictly prohibit rice shops from closing their doors and refusing to sell. However, it would be appropriate for the government to limit the quantity of rice that each person can purchase, and the price per unit should still be fair. 8) It was previously rumored that certain bureaus had purchased rice. If they originally intended to use it for regulation, they should sell it immediately. 9) Today's food problem lies in the disruption of transportation and uneven distribution. The Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau should take full responsibility during this national crisis and urgently solve the difficulties of Shanghai's food supply by focusing on the transportation and sales of grain. 10) Investigate the factories in Shanghai that manufacture food, their equipment, production capacity, and the number of workers they employ in order to manufacture food in case of emergency.

The above is a summary of the main points. In order to maintain order in Shanghai and plan for a prolonged war, there is nothing more important than this. Shanghai is a place where people from all countries gather, and it is also a commercial port with the largest population. Its situation is different from other places.

### Our Embassy in Germany Clarifies the Reason for Shells Landing in Shanghai Concessions and Bombings

Stating that Japan is Using the Concessions for Combat, Leading to the Destruction of China's Preventative Plans

[Berlin] It is reported that the Chinese Embassy issued the following statement regarding the bombing of the Shanghai International Settlement: "Regardless of the 1932 ceasefire agreement, Japan transported a large number of troops, and China was forced to take various defensive measures in Shanghai. Japanese naval landing forces invaded Zhabei from the northern part of the International Settlement and opened fire on the garrison troops. Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun protested to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, but the response was to continue the attack. Chinese troops were forced to defend themselves. When China took these measures, it tried its best to protect the safety of foreigners in Shanghai. Unfortunately, accidents occurred, and several foreigners perished, which is regrettable. The reason for the bombing of the International Settlement was that a Chinese pilot was seriously injured during aerial combat, and the bomb rack was damaged, so the bombs could not be controlled and fell automatically. Among the many Chinese people killed and injured, there were a few foreigners. The Chinese government expresses its deepest regrets and hopes that these extremely unfortunate events, which were beyond human control, will not occur again in the future.

The Chinese Air Force was compelled to take action in self-defense due to the large concentration of Japanese aircraft and warships. The Chinese government is extremely willing to avoid the impact of the war on the International Settlement, but the Japanese army is using the settlement as a base to launch large-scale attacks on territory under Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, the Japanese side has destroyed China's plan to not affect the settlement. However, China is still making every effort to take all preventative steps. Settlements that are not used as bases by the Japanese army will not be affected. We have learned that there are currently one hundred Japanese aircraft concentrated near Shanghai, preparing to bomb cities and towns along the Jinghu Line, such as Shanghai and Weiting, which have already been bombed. Japan obviously wants to force China to accept unreasonable demands by destroying China's economic center, but China has decided to resist to the end," it was said. (National Army, 15th)

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting expressed regret today regarding the fact that the Shanghai battle and bombing affected civilians, stating that these civilians were victims in the war of defending democratic sovereignty against the insatiable Japanese militarism. Wang also stated that the Chinese government has repeatedly exercised restraint since the July 7th Incident, but Japan has used aircraft to bomb various parts of China countless times. Not only have war zones suffered, but also civilians and educational and cultural institutions have been destroyed. The recent Shanghai incident was an attempt by Japan to recreate the January 28th Incident in order to destroy China's economic and financial center. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th, Reuters)

### Danger in Shanghai Concessions Created by Japan

No Sympathy Expressed by Various British Parties Towards Japan

London

The annual meeting of the League of Nations is scheduled to be held in Geneva on September 13th. Regarding the Chinese government's application to the meeting concerning the Sino-Japanese conflict, no news has been received to date. As for the discussion here, apart from the issue of protecting foreigners and foreign interests in China, the impact of the Sino-Japanese conflict on international politics is also a matter of concern. Officials are avoiding taking any position and are only expressing doubt about the possibility of a peaceful resolution of this conflict. In addition, political figures, while expressing regret that Chinese aircraft accidentally dropped bombs in the concessions, believe that, given the Japanese method of warfare, such incidents are likely to occur repeatedly. In general, political figures judge Japan's attitude with absolutely no expression of sympathy. This can be seen from the article published in today's Times, which reflects the views of those in the peace camp. As for those on the left, this goes without saying. The newspaper commented that the Japanese flagship Izumo is anchored a short distance from the concessions, so the danger of the concessions being bombed was created by the Japanese authorities. As for the Japanese side's claim that the Izumo should be anchored near the Japanese consulate, the reasons are insufficient, it was said. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th, Havas)

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issues Announcement Urging Merchants to Open for Business

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement yesterday urging merchants throughout the city to open for business. The original text is as follows: "This chamber has learned that many shops in the city have temporarily closed due to the recent tense situation and financial stagnation. However, this city has a dense population, and people from neighboring counties are flocking to Shanghai to take refuge. The daily necessities of life depend entirely on the supply from shops. Once the market closes, residents feel even more panicked. Now that the seven articles of the financial measures set by the ministry have been announced on the 16th, and since measures are being taken to ensure local order, this chamber has already separately requested the responsible authorities in each area to actively implement them. It is hoped that all banks, money shops, and shops throughout the city will open for business as soon as possible within their means. This is most earnestly requested."

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Responsible for Regulating Food Supply

Food Committee Also Established; There is Absolutely No Problem with the City's Food Supply

In the future, grain trucks and ships from various places arriving in Shanghai will not be stopped and will be allowed to pass, and they will be protected. Furthermore, the association has already made arrangements with banks and money shops regarding rice loans, and they will be released as much as possible, it was said.

First Meeting of the Food Committee

### Director Li Junxun Sincerely Informs Citizens and Students That the War of Resistance Has Begun

Proving the Victory of the Chinese Nation with the Spirit of Iron and Blood

Mr. Li Xiangqi, the chairman of the city's National Military Training Association, the director of the Civic Training Office, and the commander of the Civic Volunteer Corps, has actively organized and prepared the troops under his command to join the war at any time due to the aggression of the Japanese bandits and the start of the war. Yesterday, he specially published "Sincerely Informing the Citizens and Students Under Training in This City," encouraging everyone to unite and serve the country with a belief in certain victory. The original text is as follows:

In the name of the glory of the Chinese nation, I now sincerely inform all of you, the citizens and students under training in this city. Today is truly the first day to formally settle many muddled old scores between China and Japan over the past three hundred years with iron and blood. There is no need for excessive discussion if we win, and there is no need to be dejected if we lose. I hope that all of you will understand the current situation of the Chinese nation. Although it is said that our survival is at stake, there is no danger to blood. The wars of the past two days have completely proven that the spirit of iron and blood of the Chinese nation is more than enough to sweep away the enemy's planes and cannons. To decide the victory of the Chinese nation over the Japanese devils, in the long-term battles to come, the victory and revival of the Chinese nation will ultimately prove to be an established fact. I sincerely hope that all of you, the citizens and students under training in this city, will not stand idly by during this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to serve the country, so that our armed comrades may excel in front. I very much hope that all of you will often remember the ambitions of the day you were trained and the emotions you have felt since training, rise up and do your best to contribute to our Chinese nation. Whether at the front or in the rear, if there is a spirit of fearlessness, the Chinese nation will receive its benefit. I finally urge you that in this great and glorious sacred long-term war, I am willing to encourage and support you to carry arms generously with the belief in certain death and certain victory to become members who directly or indirectly participate in the battle.

### Italian Consul Visited Japanese Flagship to Discuss Withdrawal from Shanghai

Italian Consul Considers Safety of Foreign Nationals, Japanese Side Gave No Definite Answer

The Ta Kung Pao reports that since the Japanese army opened the war in Shanghai, the Izumo warship has been anchored in the Huangpu River, using the concession as a base of operations. Our air force, in order to eliminate the crisis, suddenly bombed, causing damage to the Great World on Avenue Edward VII and the Bund on Nanjing Road. The consular corps has repeatedly advised the Japanese warship to withdraw from the Huangpu River, but the Japanese side refused, inevitably increasing the danger to the lives and property of foreign nationals in the territory. The Italian Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Nilon, took a small boat to the Izumo warship at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to meet with the Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, and Consul Okamoto. After about an hour of talks, he was sent back by a small steamship dispatched by the Izumo warship. A Ta Kung Pao reporter specially visited the Italian consulate staff, who said that Mr. Nilon's trip was also to discuss the withdrawal of the Izumo warship with the Japanese side in order to maintain the security of the concession, but the Japanese side gave no definite answer, resulting in no result.

### Public Concession Eastern District Police Station Not Withdrawn

Reporter from Shanghai United Press Personally Visited and Witnessed the Tragic Situation of Compatriots Being Persecuted

The main force of the war is now focused on the Eastern District, especially the Yulin Road area, which is a dense area of artillery fire and machine gun fire. It was rumored yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Council police officers stationed there had withdrawn. A reporter from the Shanghai United Press, accompanied by police officers, ventured to the area to inspect it yesterday morning. Passing through Broadway Road, Japanese soldiers stood guard every three steps, all lying behind obstacles, glaring fiercely. Fortunately, a Japanese police head stood beside the left side of the car, greeting the garrison with passwords along the way, and was able to proceed smoothly. However, the Huishan, Yulin, and Tilanqiao police stations in the Eastern District are still open as usual, but there is no official business to conduct. They cannot go out to perform their duties in the districts under their jurisdiction. Moreover, due to stray bullets flying around, they can only stay indoors. However, the Yangshupu police station is located at the forefront of the fire line. All Chinese and foreign police officers are still stationed there, but they have even less official business to conduct than the three police stations in Huishan. According to the person in charge of the police station, all police agencies of the Shanghai Municipal Council north of the Suzhou River have withdrawn from only the Hongkou and Dixwell Road police stations, while the rest are still stationed as usual. All around the Yulin Road police station are Japanese shops. High-angle guns and machine guns are mounted on every roof. There are still many refugees who have not escaped along the way, but they are afraid that the Japanese will disregard humanity and massacre innocent people at any time, so they hide indoors and dare not go out. The reporter met Mr. Huang Renhe, who said that our army did indeed enter the two spinning mills, Gongda and Donghua, at dawn yesterday morning. The Donghua Mill is located at 1683 Huade Road, near the Liping Road intersection. Gongda and Donghua are both densely populated by Japanese troops. There are indeed no traces of the enemy east of Liping Road and Yangshupu Road. The Jun Gong Road is even occupied by our army. On the way back, the reporter saw more than a dozen Japanese transport vehicles, fully loaded with enemy soldiers and ammunition, hurriedly exiting Broadway Road and turning into Yangshupu Road, speeding eastward, seemingly to reinforce. At the same time, there were seven truck convoys coming from the east and turning into Zhaofeng Road, heading north, seemingly newly landed from enemy ships. The military flags were all rolled up beside the vehicles, so the number could not be seen clearly. When passing the Outer Hongqiao Bridge, the corpses of four innocent refugees who had been brutally killed by the enemy were found at the bridgehead, already rotting and smelling nauseating. The reporter asked the police officers who accompanied him from the police station, who said that they had been lying there for three days and could not be collected. As the reporter was about to look out the car window, he was spotted by an enemy guard at the bridgehead. The reporter was wearing plain clothes, but the guard raised his gun as if to shoot. He quickly ducked back inside and sped south.

### Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Four Banks to Resume Business First Today

Banking Industry to Formulate Four Supplementary Measures, Three Banks to Manage Reserve and Clearing House, Other Banks and Money Shops to Temporarily Suspend Business

Since the Ministry of Finance announced the "Measures for Stabilizing Finance in Extraordinary Times," the Shanghai Banking Industry Association believes that Shanghai is the financial hub of the country, and industries and businesses everywhere rely on Shanghai for regulation. In order to facilitate the circulation of goods, it has formulated four supplementary measures, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. However, in order to maintain the financial order and maintain normal business, the Ministry ordered the two associations to entrust the Central, China, and Communications Banks to effectively manage the joint reserve and clearing house established by them, in order to prevent abuses and stabilize finance. The Ministry ordered the two associations to comply and also sent a letter to the three banks to do so. The original submission from the Banking Industry Association and the approval from the Ministry of Finance are recorded below.

Association Submission

We have investigated and found that the Ministry has already clearly defined measures to stabilize national finance and has issued orders to various places to comply. However, Shanghai is the financial hub of the country, and industries and businesses everywhere rely on Shanghai for regulation. Recently, due to the extension of the war, public panic has been even greater. Now, in order to facilitate the circulation of goods, the association and others have formulated four supplementary measures to further stabilize the market. In the future, if the association and others have appropriate measures to maintain the market, they will report them to the Ministry for verification at any time. Is it appropriate? We respectfully await your instructions and compliance. Attached are four supplementary measures.

Four Measures

㊀ All bank and money shop bills of exchange shall be affixed with a "Same Industry Exchange" stamp. These bills of exchange shall only be allowed to be exchanged among the same industry in Shanghai and shall not be paid in legal tender to purchase foreign exchange. ㊁ Bills of exchange and checks issued by bank and money shop depositors before August 12 of this year shall also be regarded as same industry exchange bills. ㊂ All current deposits of banks and money shops, in addition to paying legal tender in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, all balances in commercial transactions with commercial departments, due to commercial needs, may be paid by same industry exchange. ㊃ For all renewal or new term depositors, banks and money shops shall indicate legal tender or exchange, and payment shall still be made separately in legal tender or exchange.

Ministry of Finance Approval

We have received your submission. The four supplementary measures you proposed are hereby approved for temporary implementation during this extraordinary period. However, in order to maintain the financial order and maintain legitimate business, the joint reserve and clearing house established by the two associations shall be entrusted to the Central, China, and Communications Banks for effective management, in order to prevent abuses and stabilize finance. In addition to sending a letter to the three banks, you should immediately comply with this approval.

Set Up Offices

The Central, China, and Communications Banks and the Central Trust Bureau have jointly found No. 439 Avenue Albert, French Concession, as a temporary office to regulate the city's finance. It has been decided to move in and open for business at 9:00 a.m. today. The business methods will be handled in accordance with the seven measures for stabilizing finance promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. As for other banks, money shops, and postal savings remittance bureaus, etc., due to the extreme intensity of the Shanghai war, it is practically impossible to open for business. They have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend business. They will resume business on a scheduled basis as soon as the war situation is slightly calmer. The Banking Association held a temporary members' meeting at the Zhonghui Bank at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and invited non-member banks to participate in the discussion. The exchange matters of various peer bills and the internal problems of various banks during the suspension of business were discussed. Since yesterday, various foreign banks in the city have also temporarily suspended business due to the war.

Unified Exchange Rate

Since the temporary suspension of business by the banking industry after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, money exchange shops have taken the opportunity to lower market prices, which has greatly affected the general public. Because various banks and money shops were still not open yesterday, the market situation was once again chaotic, and market prices were further reduced. Moreover, banknotes of five yuan and ten yuan, etc., were refused to be exchanged. The city's Money Exchange Industry Association, in order to stabilize the market and unify the exchange rate, has specifically convened all members at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss and decide on a unified exchange rate method, which will then be announced to all industries for uniform implementation.

### Reports of French Anti-Aircraft Guns Bombarding Our Aircraft Are Inaccurate

Central News Agency Paris, 16th (Havas) - According to news from the Japanese side in Shanghai, the Shanghai concession authorities have set up anti-aircraft guns in the French concession and fired several shots at Chinese aircraft flying over the concession this morning, causing the Chinese aircraft to change their flight path. After this news spread here, all newspapers were extremely concerned. Later, a Havas telegram was received denying the above rumors, believing that they were completely unfounded, and everyone was relieved.

### Shanghai Concession Authorities Urge Citizens to Remain Calm

In Case of Air Raids, Must Immediately Take Shelter Indoors

Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, issued a posted announcement yesterday, saying: "This is to announce that the current situation is unstable and people's hearts are shaken. However, our government loves peace and has been declared to the world by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which is known to friendly countries. As the Commander, I am duty-bound to defend the territory and protect the people. All members of the public should do their best to remain calm and obey the government. They should especially protect friendly foreign nationals at all times and in all places as much as possible. If there are any lawless elements who attempt to disturb public order, they will be severely arrested and prosecuted without any leniency. All must abide by this and implement it earnestly. This is the announcement."

The Shanghai Public Concession Bureau announced: "All residents and refugees in the Public Concession, in the event of an air raid (airplane war), must immediately take shelter indoors and hide by a protective wall. Do not stand outside the wall, by the door, or by the window, etc. Although there may not be bombs, the greatest danger is shrapnel and unexploded bullets, etc., which may fall from the air. No one, under any circumstances, should stand in the open or watch from the roof."

The French Patrol Police and various groups have been posting notices along the streets for days, urging citizens to pay attention. The general idea is: "Please take shelter in nearby houses when airplanes pass by, and then close the doors and windows of the houses immediately. As the current situation prolongs, the public should only walk outside when necessary."

### On-the-Spot Inspection Record by Our Reporter at the Forefront

Soldiers Have Not Rested for Four Days and Nights, A Certain Military Officer Talks About Fragments of Victory

When the air battle between the two sides was fierce yesterday morning, our reporter specially went to the Jiangwan Zhabei front line to inspect it. As the car passed the iron fence of the Public Concession and arrived at our army's defense line, he felt a kind of solemn, inviolable atmosphere, and the excitement of his spirit rose to the boiling point. The brave soldiers of our army, fully armed, with five or six hand grenades hanging on their chests, were not very tall, but each was lively and brave. Their ages were all around twenty years old. In their amiable conversation, they showed a stern and unyielding expression. The car twisted and turned forward towards the fortifications, and the defenses were gradually strengthened. There were still some refugees scattered along the way, but most of them still lived calmly in the war zone. Women were carrying their children and walking naturally on the street. The people were gathered in clusters, chatting. This quiet phenomenon, on the one hand, can imply the victory of the war at the front, and on the other hand, it can be seen that the army and the people are united as one, and the people in the rear are calm and calm. Walking again and again, taking step by step closer to the front line, the sound of guns and cannons gradually became denser. The sound of small cannons and mortars shook the eardrums even more. When approaching the front line by one hundred meters, bullets whizzed over the top of the head. He quickly squatted down and walked along the wall. At first, he felt a little scared, but later he became calm. The most moving sight in the trenches of the first line of defense was the brave soldiers of our army, who had not closed their eyes for four days and nights. Their eyes emitted a red light, fixed on the enemy's line of defense across the way, waiting madly to kill the enemy. Their whole bodies were covered in mud, and their faces and hands could not be distinguished. The reporter silently paid them his infinite respect with tears in his eyes, not knowing whether they were sweet or sour. He hurriedly bid farewell, ran to a slightly distant place, and found several senior officers. He spoke freely about the process of killing the enemy. Everyone's faces were full of excitement, and they were truly unspeakably happy. At this moment, several wounded brave soldiers of our army were carried in. The reporter hurriedly ran over, shook their hot hands, and expressed his deep condolences. They nodded in thanks in a slight groan. The reporter also said goodbye and got into the car. As the wheels whizzed and spun, the scenes he had seen on the front line flooded into his mind one by one. He felt that the people in the rear had not fulfilled their responsibilities to protect the country. He only felt one hundred and twenty minutes of apology and shame for the brave soldiers at the front who were fighting desperately and sacrificing their lives to defend the country.

The reporter talked with a young military officer at the front for ten minutes. He was the one who led the team to besiege the enemy near the Patriotic Girls' School at 4:00 a.m. yesterday. He roughly said something about the battle situation... "We received orders to depart from the Zhizhi University. The sky was not yet bright, and we walked forward quickly. At first, we did not see any traces of the enemy. When we arrived at the northwest side of the Patriotic Girls' School, the enemy's machine guns fired densely. We crawled forward one by one. After a while, we shouted in unison and bravely chased after them. They retreated. About half a mile away, the enemy retreated and entrenched themselves in high-rise buildings, where dozens of enemy troops were ambushed. Machine guns swept again, and the smoke and flames were dense, which was just right to cover us. At this time, our team also used dense artillery fire to deal with them, sweeping the enemy downstairs. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy on the upper floors jumped out of the back windows one after another, some injured and some fleeing. Our army did not pursue further and hurriedly entered the search, seizing a lot of ammunition. At this time, the rising sun everyone calmed down. The building had windows on all sides, and there were no tall buildings nearby. It could be seen hundreds of meters away. As a temporary bunker, it was in the best position. After we had finished the arrangement, we sent a team to search the Patriotic Girls' School. We did not see the enemy inside, and our reinforcements had arrived one after another. The plan to encircle the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters was finally completed..."

The military officer was very eloquent. Then he said, "At this final moment, we only know how to fight for survival, fight for justice, and fight to defend our territory. Life can be sacrificed. What else are we nostalgic for? Therefore, on the day before 'August 13,' when our army received orders to go to Shanghai to fight, which one of us was not spirited and took the lead bravely? We know that our government has an overall plan, and our soldiers have the final determination. We hope that our compatriots will fight to the end with one heart and one mind. Victory will definitely be ours." When he spoke, his attitude was激昂 and his will was strong. He was worthy of being a rising star in the National Army.

I also have to report to the readers that he is from Liaoning Province and is a patriot who has no home to return to. He studied at Tongji University earlier and later transferred to the third grade of Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping. He was promoted to the Central Military Academy and graduated this year. He enlisted in the army for three months.

### British, American, Italian, and Dutch Nationals Prepare to Leave Shanghai

American Women and Children to Manila This Morning, French Concession Not Considering Evacuation

After the Western nationals in the Public Concession north of the Suzhou River were notified by the consulates of various countries to retreat to the south of the Suzhou River, British women and children nationals were the first to be scheduled to leave Shanghai on British ships on the 17th. Other nationals were also notified by the British Consulate to gather at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and leave on a scheduled basis. The US Consulate is also preparing to evacuate American nationals and has scheduled the first batch of women and children to be sent to Manila on the President Jefferson. The French Consulate has not considered the evacuation of French nationals, believing that the safety of nationals in the French Concession is absolutely not a concern. As for Italian nationals, they will also leave Shanghai if necessary. The Dutch Consulate in Shanghai has also notified Dutch nationals in the city to register with the consulate as soon as possible so that they can be protected and leave Shanghai if necessary. At the same time, it has chartered a ship, the Tsinan, from the Java Mailboat Company to be stationed outside the Wusong Estuary in preparation for nationals to board and take shelter. As for Japanese nationals who have stayed in Shanghai and those who have come to Shanghai from Hankou and other places, most of them have not had time to return to Japan, numbering at least 6,000 or more. These temporary nationals are currently protected by the Chinese and Japanese armies and concentrated in the Yangshupu area, waiting for an opportunity to take ships back to Japan. The remaining Japanese nationals are concentrated in the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund.

### Zhang Zhizhong Sends Telegram to Thank the Support Association

The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association previously sent a telegram to General Zhang Zhizhong, commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, to express their condolences. Commander Zhang has now received a reply telegram saying, "(Omissions)... I am deeply grateful for your kind telegram. It is the duty of soldiers to resist aggression for the country. I am ashamed and dare not accept your praise. I am especially grateful for your purchase of condolences. I hereby send a telegram on behalf of all the soldiers of the army to express my gratitude. Zhang Zhizhong salutes."

### Ministry of Finance Spokesperson Talks About the Significance of Issuing National Salvation Bonds

Encourage Citizens to Donate to Save the Country, Total Amount of Bonds is 500 Million Yuan

The newspaper reported the other day that the government had a plan to issue circulating vouchers. When a reporter from the Central News Agency visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, he said, "The foundation of our country's legal tender is extremely stable. The so-called issue of circulating vouchers that has been rumored outside may be a private proposal. The government has no intention of doing so, nor is it necessary. However, since the full-scale war of resistance was launched, citizens have been donating money and goods with patriotic enthusiasm to help the country. As citizens fulfill their responsibility to save the country, they do not expect any reward. The expenses for saving the country should be borne by the entire nation. The government should encourage the enthusiasm of these patriotic people who are destroying their families to relieve the national crisis. Therefore, regulations have been formulated to issue national salvation bonds. All people or organizations who donate cash or valuable items for the purpose of saving the country will be given national salvation bond tickets in accordance with the amount donated. The principal will be repaid in installments after the end of the war. The purpose of these bonds is not only to compensate the donors, but also to commend the honor of those who contribute money to save the country." The draft of the National Salvation Bond Regulations is attached below.

Draft National Salvation Bond Regulations

Article 1. The National Government shall issue bonds to encourage national salvation donations, named National Salvation Bonds. Article 2. All individuals or organizations who donate cash or valuable items for the purpose of saving the country shall be given these bonds in accordance with the amount donated. Article 3. The total amount of these bonds is 500 million yuan, issued at 100% of the face value. Article 4. These bonds shall be repaid in installments over 20 years from the third year after the end of the war, with a lottery drawn every six months, and funds shall be allocated by the national treasury. Article 5. The bond tickets for these bonds shall be divided into seven types: 10,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. All are in bearer form. Article 6.

### Wartime Services in Various Circles in the Rear

Rescue and Comfort Actively Underway

Ambulance Teams

The city's Ambulance Committee is rescuing wounded soldiers day and night, working tirelessly. The wounded are first rescued from the front lines by emergency teams in vehicles and then sent to various ambulance teams or hospitals for treatment. The committee currently has sixteen emergency teams stationed in areas such as Datong, Zhabei, Zhenru, Nanxiang, and Xinzhuang. Wounded soldier hospitals are located in Kunshan, Jiaxing, Jiading, Taicang, and other places, and are in contact with local military and police. All ambulance team members are bravely risking their lives amidst gunfire to rescue the wounded, resulting in the complete annihilation of all stretcher bearers in the Datong emergency team by enemy artillery fire, a heroic sacrifice. However, due to the current shortage of gasoline, the transportation of ambulances is facing extreme difficulties. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that all sectors of society will conserve gasoline and donate to the committee (address: China Red Cross Society, 856 Xinzha Road) so that rescue work will not be halted. Yesterday, a total of over two hundred wounded soldiers from the front lines, mostly with minor injuries, have already been sent to various hospitals for treatment.

Literary Circles

Shanghai's literary circles held an inaugural meeting of the Wartime Service Corps at the Guanle Garden at 10:00 AM yesterday.

The Shanghai Lawyers Association, recognizing the seriousness of the national crisis and the selfless and fearless efforts of the soldiers fighting the enemy at the front, has formed five sub-committees: ㊀ military training, ㊁ relief, ㊂ propaganda, ㊃ discipline, and ㊄ fundraising. All executive and supervisory committee members will each take responsibility for one group to carry out various tasks. Regarding the issue of comforting the loyal and brave soldiers at the front, a committee has been appointed to purchase necessary items and will immediately elect representatives to send them to the front lines for comfort.

General Labor Union

The war has been fierce in recent days, even more so than during the January 28th Incident. The anti-Japanese heroes injured at the front, in addition to some who received initial treatment on the spot, had a portion transported back to the Shanghai Red Cross Society Hospital for treatment a few days ago. The city's General Labor Union and the Labor Salvation Association specially appointed Standing Committee members Zhang Kechang, Shao Xubai, and Long Peiyun at 9:00 AM yesterday, carrying fruits, cigarettes, biscuits, and other comfort items to the wounded soldier hospital at the intersection of Aiduya Road and Sichuan Road to express their condolences and respect. The wounded soldiers expressed their gratitude and expressed their willingness to continue killing the enemy after being discharged from the hospital. Their anti-Japanese spirit was extremely enthusiastic. Furthermore, since the Workers' Wartime Service Corps of the association began registration, the number of participants has increased exponentially. In addition to convening a meeting of all members at the Xiaonanmen Association a few days ago, the first batch of volunteers to go to the front lines to undertake military transportation work gathered at the association's office at 9:00 AM on the 15th.

Recently, it was heard that the soldiers on the front lines needed dry food, fruits, and other items, so they specially prepared fruit trucks, totaling thousands of pounds, to send to the front lines, and continued to prepare bread and other items to send by car.

The city's Mingshe Society, organized by people from the industrial and commercial sectors, has been established for nearly a year and has devoted much effort to social events.

Traditional Chinese Medicine Circles

The city's National Medicine Branch, National Medicine Association, Shenzhou National Medicine Society, Chinese National Medicine Society, Shanghai National Medicine Society, Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association, and other groups, recognizing the impending national crisis, have specially resolved to do their best to contribute to the government.

### National Salvation Work

Battlefield Service, Fundraising, and Comfort

National Salvation Association Battlefield Service

Since the sudden change in the situation in Pingjin and the Japanese invaders invaded China, the national spirit has been extremely inspired. The city's national salvation organizations have been established one after another. The Chinese Youth National Salvation Association was born just as the Shanghai War broke out, and is actively engaged in anti-Japanese and national salvation work. The reporter visited a person in charge of the association yesterday and received a very detailed account of the process. The outline is recorded as follows: Our association is the only organization of national salvation youth in Shanghai, composed of people with enthusiasm for patriotic groups. It convened an inaugural meeting yesterday (the 15th) and issued a declaration. Its main purpose is to resist Japan, save the nation, and recover lost territories, and it plans to participate in various battlefield service work in the near future. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide various conveniences in their work, and especially hope that gentlemen in the commentary circles will provide guidance at any time so that the great cause of Chinese national salvation can be completed.

The association's temporary address is at 15 Jin Shenfu Road. Anyone who sympathizes with the association's national salvation work can automatically participate. Therefore, there has been a great rush to register to join the association in recent days. The daily registration time is from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and the procedure is very simple.

Children's Theater Society Fundraising and Comfort

The Chinese Model Children's Theater Society originally planned to perform a large-scale national salvation children's drama. Due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it was unable to perform. All members of the society organized the "Children's National Salvation Association" and agreed on: (A) sending an official letter to the Social Affairs Bureau for record and joining the Anti-Enemy Support Association; (B) dividing the work into five departments: drama, film, publishing, publicity, and comfort; (C) dividing the publicity into four teams: lectures, slogans, drawings, and singing; (D) dividing the comfort into two teams: fundraising and comfort. They set off yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to raise funds in various places. Half of the proceeds will be used to relieve refugees and half to comfort wounded soldiers. The team gathered at 5:00 PM, and the directors purchased comfort items and went to various shelters and hospitals to offer condolences.

National Salvation Speaking Troupe Seeks Talent

The People's National Salvation Speaking Troupe has been praised by the general public in Shanghai for its work since its establishment. In addition to engaging in national salvation propaganda in public places such as radio stations, schools, and factories in Shanghai a few days ago, the troupe is now in this extraordinary period, so its work should be carried out more actively. For example, increasing broadcasting time on radio stations, as well as sending speakers to refugee shelters in Shanghai, and even distributing them to provinces, cities, townships, and towns across the country to engage in national salvation propaganda in order to awaken the general public and immediately engage in national salvation. In addition, the troupe has also formed a comfort team to raise money and materials to transport to the front to comfort the heroic soldiers. Therefore, the troupe feels that the talent within the troupe is not enough to allocate. Anyone who is enthusiastic about national salvation work and has speaking talent and experience, regardless of gender, is asked to go and participate. The troupe's address is 113 Parker Road in the British Concession.

Art Circles National Salvation Group Established

### Refugee Relief Situation in Various Institutions

Two Thousand Ningbo People Returned to Their Hometown Yesterday

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, refugees have gathered in the concessions, and due to the obstruction of land and water transportation, evacuation has become a problem. According to the Ningbo Shanghai Association, the association has specially found a Fushun merchant ship to temporarily rent and will send a batch of fellow refugees back to their hometown. The number is estimated to be more than a thousand. The ship set sail at 8:00 AM yesterday. If there are no obstacles, it can safely arrive in Ningbo last night. According to the report of the comfort personnel sent to the front by the association, our army is currently short of food, and they need fruits because they are thirsty on the front lines. Please ask the people in the rear to provide assistance.

Relief Efforts of the Guangdong Association

The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. The committee has provided relief to tens of thousands of refugees in recent days, and the original Yun Nan Road Renji Tang Association address is insufficient. It was specially moved to the Pudong Township Association office yesterday. However, in order to facilitate contact with various circles, the training group is still located on Yunnan Road.

Rescue Efforts of the Red Swastika Society

The Red Swastika Society rescue team still mixed the first and second teams into four routes yesterday and set off successively at 7:00 AM in the morning. The first route was led by team leader Hu Zhongcheng, accompanied by Chang Yi, to Hongkou Huasheng Road and Yangshupu to rescue more than 500 ladder people, who were all sent to relatives and friends along the way. The remaining dozens of people were sent to the third shelter for resettlement. The second route was led by President Li Dixian, accompanied by members, to Baoshan Road and Tiantong'an Road, where they rescued old, weak, women, and children at any time. The third route was led by team members with stretchers to the battlefield to rescue injured soldiers and civilians. However, while traveling to Zhongyou Road, just as the two armies were fighting, bullets were flying and the artillery fire was intense. The team lay down in the riverbank, and many shells fell to the left and right, splashing mud and water so that the team members were like entering a muddy road. The team members still risked their lives to rescue the wounded soldiers and sent them to the first and second hospitals. The fourth route was led by team leader Shi Yangxing, leading the staff members from Nanyang Bridge to the Zhaojia Road, turning to Zhonghua Road, and entering the Penglai Road Wenmiao Road to patrol the Nanshi area, rescuing more than 50 refugees along the way. It was also heard that the society's fourth shelter has begun to accommodate more than 100 people. Currently, there are many homeless refugees along the streets. The society has temporarily used the Changle Tea Garden on Sima Road as the fifth shelter and has invited Zhao Pinshan to be the director of the shelter and Wang Genghu to be the deputy director. The sixth shelter is being funded by Zhang Nachuan of the Central Trust Bureau and is also in preparation and will be established in the near future.

### Continued Commentary from English and French Newspapers on the Far East Situation

The English Times Urges the World to Pay Attention to Japan's Actions

[London] Following a cabinet meeting, the Japanese government issued a public statement declaring that Japan does not desire to occupy Chinese territory. The Times of London has published an article commenting on the Far Eastern situation and reviewing the unfortunate events that have created the current situation. It believes that the Japanese government welcomes these unfortunate events because they can partition Chinese territory. The Chinese government believes that Japan clearly wants to obtain a corridor in North China, creating a superior Japanese power, to serve as a base for defending against Soviet Russia, and at the same time, to attack southern China. The current serious situation would not be difficult to resolve, but Japan's increasing troops in Hebei is making the situation increasingly serious. The newspaper solemnly declares that this state of hostility is neither beneficial nor harmful to both sides. Britain, France, and the United States have important interests in the Far East that must be protected and are now maintaining close cooperation. (Sixteenth National Telegram)

[Paris] Various newspapers have continued to comment on the war between China and Japan. The Socialist People's Daily reported that the main task of the major powers is no longer to prevent war or stop war, but to limit the scope of the war and prevent it from becoming general. Whether this policy is effective is not discussed for the moment, but it is true that the major powers have greatly retreated as a result. The real question now is whether these countries recognize this retreat as a fait accompli, or whether they want to restore their lost position. Regarding this point, these countries only need to work together and persistently to succeed. Otherwise, the countries will have no way out of their current state of disappointment and danger. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)

[Paris] Local newspapers today published lengthy reports on Chinese aircraft dropping bombs in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. However, the number of deaths and injuries varied from newspaper to newspaper. It is reported that the Shanghai Consular Body plans to propose to the Chinese and Japanese authorities that both sides of the Shanghai war cease using aircraft. The newspapers also discussed the reason why the bombs were dropped. It is reported that the Chinese authorities are very disturbed by this bombing and that the Chinese pilots did not do it intentionally. (Fifteenth National Telegram)

[London] The Times recently commented on the war between China and Japan, saying, "If the world focuses on Japan's actions and not on its declared policies, then what Japan uses to accuse China, even if it was not intentionally manufactured by Japan, will certainly be used by Japan to the fullest extent, hoping to re-divide a large part of Chinese territory. This is clearly obvious. The goal of Japan's true rulers is to create a corridor in northern China, controlled and organized by Japan, to become a military base for countering Soviet Russia. Once there is an appropriate opportunity, it will continue to invade the south. Britain, the United States, and France all have important interests in the Far East that must be protected, and they are now closely linked to deal with it." The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, reported, "If China appeals to the League of Nations regarding Japan's aggression, all member states of the League of Nations should consider the best way to fulfill their obligations. One method worth trying is to issue an application to both China and Japan, especially to issue a warning to Japan, and to have countries with direct relations serve as mediators."

[Paris] General Yang Hucheng, who went abroad for investigation after the Xi'an Incident, is now here and preparing to return home. According to Yang's interview with a "Late News" reporter, he was summoned back home by telegram from Chairman Chiang. China has no other way out but to resist its brutal enemy, Japan, by various means. We must remember that only a free China is a guarantee of peace in the Far East. China's only hope is to survive peacefully, but peace cannot be achieved until Japanese imperialism abandons its aggression. (Fifteenth National Telegram)

The Municipal Police Headquarters recently arrested a female traitor from Yangzhou named Li Naigeng for spying on our military intelligence in the Nanshi area. The police arrested her. It is now reported that this case has been thoroughly investigated, and Chief Cai Jinjun ordered her to be executed by firing squad. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Yao Guangnai, director of the Ximen Branch, and Shen Zhenhua, director of the Laobeimen Police Station, identified the traitor Li Naigeng according to the law, and then escorted her to Chen Yingshi's former execution site in Laoximen to be executed by firing squad. Everyone who saw it applauded.

One Traitor Beaten to Death

Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, next to a tea jar on the roadside at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Avenue Edward VII, a bare-chested traitor wearing blue cloth trousers suddenly sprinkled poison powder into the tea. After the crowd discovered it, they beat him and planned to drag him to the police station. When he reached the entrance of the Ningbo Fellow Association, the traitor fell to the ground and died. It is also heard that there were two other beatings on the road.

Hong Renbao Arrested

Hong Renbao, a follower of the big traitor Chang Yuqing in western Shanghai, usually recruits workers for the Japanese. Therefore, he relies on the power of the Japanese to act recklessly. The citizens have been disgusted by him. Since the start of the war, the citizens of western Shanghai have all wanted to catch him and feel satisfied. The traitor hid deep in the Gongda Yarn Factory and dared not go out. After the Japanese army withdrew, the traitor still lingered, seemingly with a mission. Yesterday, at around 1:00 AM, the traitor jumped out of the Gongda breach due to lack of food. He was captured by our security team and handed over to the headquarters for interrogation. The capture of this big traitor has greatly pleased the people.

Four Traitors Arrested

(1) Yesterday at 5:15 PM, four traitors were discovered at the intersection of Minitini Road and Wagner Table Road in the French Concession, secretly putting some kind of medicine powder into the tea jar there. Residents living there saw their secretive actions and immediately reported them to the nearby Boy Scouts. Many Boy Scouts rushed over. Two traitors escaped when they saw that the situation was not good, but the other two were caught because they escaped slowly. After the Boy Scouts checked them, they found that each traitor was carrying a seven-inch pistol. When they took off their straw hats, they saw Japanese symbols written on the leather edges inside the hats. When asked if they were traitors, they did not defend themselves at all. The Boy Scouts took them to the nearby police station to be investigated. (2) Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, a traitor used by the Japanese scattered poison powder in the tea pavilion in the area of ​​Gordon Road and Xinzha Road in western Shanghai. A bag of poison powder and enemy symbols were found on his body. Knowing that he was a traitor, the crowd became agitated and beat him severely. After the police arrived and inquired about the situation, they detained him and sent him to the police station to await trial in court. (3) Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, Boy Scouts dispatched by the Red Cross captured a traitor near Qingliang Temple. The traitor was disguised as a rickshaw puller, pushing an unlicensed and half-broken rickshaw. He passed by the Red Cross on Xinzha Road and frequently asked the Boy Scouts how many wounded soldiers there were in the hospital and how the work was going. The Boy Scouts suspected that the person was suspicious and detained him in the association. The headquarters sent someone to investigate. The man initially denied it, but then confessed that he had been used by the Japanese because of financial difficulties. He was taken to the headquarters for interrogation.

### Tobacco and Paper Shops and Rice Shops Are Destroyed One After Another

Treacherous Merchants Can Be Condemned; Refugee Plunder is Worrying

Da Feng Chang Destroyed

Yesterday afternoon at 12:50 PM, the owner of Da Feng Chang Tobacco and Paper Shop at 587 Yu Qiaqing Road, Shou Yizhi, was driven by greed. In the face of the current national crisis and the fiercest war of resistance, he deliberately lowered the exchange rate of legal tender. He was willing to exchange five yuan of legal tender for only four yuan, and one yuan of legal tender for only eight jiao of auxiliary currency. This caused dissatisfaction among the people, who questioned him one after another. The shop owner did not know how to repent and instead spoke rudely, which aroused public outrage. Da Feng Chang was immediately destroyed without leaving anything behind. The shop owner saw that the situation was not good and fortunately escaped through the back door, thus avoiding being beaten. After the police arrived, they persuaded the crowd to disperse, and the situation calmed down.

Disturbances at Qian Tai Chang

Yesterday evening at around 6:45 PM, at the Qian Tai Chang double-front tobacco and paper shop at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibai Ge Road, refugees had a quarrel because they bought goods for one yuan and made eight jiao. Then they fought fiercely. In an instant, hundreds of refugees used door panels, doors, etc. to hit each other indiscriminately. The iron railings installed on the top were knocked down, and the remaining counters, display windows, and glass were destroyed. Fortunately, the soldiers guarding the Niaozhen Road Bridge arrived, and the refugees dispersed in a rush, suffering heavy losses.

Xie Da Aids the Enemy with Rice

It is said that Xie Da Rice Shop on Bei Di Road aids the enemy with grain. Yesterday afternoon, it aroused the public outrage of patriotic people. Some citizens destroyed the shop yesterday, and the order was in chaos. Then, members of the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps persuaded the people to disperse and maintain order. Moreover, the shop was willing to donate 26 bags of rice to relieve the refugees. Then, members of the corps transported them by car to the local association and ordered them to be transferred to the Great World Refugee Shelter for the refugees to eat. In addition, the associated Xin Da Rice Shop also said that it would donate more than 100 bags of rice to relieve the refugees.

Refugees Rob Rice

At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon at Aolihe Road and Anna Jin Road in the French Concession, five small carts (i.e., Yangjiao carts) full of white rice, each carrying about five dan, were traveling from north to south. Refugees saw this along the way and immediately went forward to question whether there was an invoice and where it was being sent. If they could point it out, they would be allowed to pass. Otherwise, this rice stone must be helping the enemy. Therefore, the refugees rushed forward and completely robbed the five carts of white rice.

150 bags of rice were stolen from No. 15, Wen Zhou Road. 190 dan of rice were stolen from Jia Yuan Sheng Rice Shop on Tian Zao Road. More than ten people, including Ma Xiaogen, Liu Dingbang, Qian Caixi, and Lu Daan, were arrested by the police and sent to the court for severe punishment yesterday morning.

Punishment for Raising Prices

Lawyer Wang Boxian recently proposed to the Shanghai Lawyers Association Temporary Emergency Conference to suggest that the Legislative Yuan quickly formulate a law to punish merchants for raising prices during national disasters. Merchants who are mad with greed often take advantage of incidents to monopolize and hoard essential goods for people's lives and raise prices, which directly affects the lives of the entire people. There is no different from speaking for the enemy. If there is no unified method of sanctions, how can we provide relief?

Pan Yutai Will Be Severely Punished

Hong Chengtai Rice Shop at the Wujiaochang entrance in Caojiadu is opened by a person named Pan Yutai, who used to do business with various Japanese factories in western Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he closed his doors and no longer sold rice. He wrote on the door that the rice was sold out and no longer traded. In fact, he hoarded the rice upstairs and sent the old stewards to transport the rice to the Shanghai Silk Company every night, and then the Japanese tried to transport it to Zhabei. This method has been going on for a long time because the transportation takes place late at night, and the residents have not noticed it. Previously, because the concession announced martial law at 10:00 PM, he had to transport it earlier. He was discovered by our residents on the left and right, and the conspiracy was reported to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau by the people yesterday morning. The police immediately tried to open the inside of the shop, and the rice was piled up like a mountain, completely hidden upstairs. After the police discovered it, they immediately ordered the shop's clerks to open the door to the market, and on the one hand, they escorted the accountant to the headquarters for investigation. It is heard that the shop owner Pan Yutai is hiding in a certain place on Juluda Road in the French Concession. The authorities have decided to find a way to arrest and severely punish him.

### Japanese Policemen Robbed Rice Shops

Threatening with Guns to Force the Sale of Rice; The Crowd Rushed to the Scene, But He Escaped

Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, at the Daxin Rice Shop at the intersection of Sandanyuan Road and Huanlong Road in the French Concession of this city, a Japanese policeman from the Public Concession suddenly broke in with a gun, robbed the shop owner, and forced him to sell white rice. The shop owner was unable to resist under the threat of a gun and was in great danger. Fortunately, passers-by discovered it and gathered outside the shop. The crowd was furious and wanted to enter and punish him severely. When a detective saw it, he went forward to drive him away. Just as Chinese policemen also rushed to the scene after hearing the news, the thug saw that the detectives were gathering and escaped through the back door.

### Postal Services Are Maintained as Much as Possible

Only Parcel Exchanges Are Temporarily Suspended

According to the Shanghai Post Office, postal services will be maintained as much as possible, but only ordinary registered and express mail will be accepted for the time being. Parcel and exchange services will be temporarily suspended. All branches in the Public Concession and the French Concession will still be open as usual. For notifications, please call 40395 to contact the director's office of the Postal Administration. Those who wish to pick up private mailbox mail can enter and exit through the large iron gate of the North Suzhou Road Post Office.

### Common Sense During Air Raids

During fierce air battles, shrapnel from anti-aircraft guns and stray bullets from machine guns often injure people. Many refugees and shop employees and residents in the Zujie area wander the streets, looking up to watch during aerial battles, which makes them vulnerable to stray bullets. It is even more dangerous to sit on the roof and watch. Yesterday, the relief committee organized by all sectors of the city dispatched members to warn shops and residents not to leave their homes during air raids. Those who are traveling in vehicles must also stop and lean against strong walls or crawl on the ground to avoid danger.

### Miss Pettus Proves That There Were No Chinese Soldiers at Shanghai University

The Japanese Want to Cover Up Their Actions of Destroying Culture

The Zi Lin Pao has twice published the Japanese military authorities' remarks that Shanghai University harbored Chinese soldiers who were engaged in renting and attacking, and that the Japanese army planned to bombard it, and claimed that a foreigner from a neutral country had proved that the university harbored Chinese soldiers. Yesterday, the newspaper republished a letter from Miss Pettus, an accountant at the university, asking the women and children in the school to withdraw on August 12 at the order of the US consul. Only two Americans lived in the school, one of whom was Miss Pettus. The next day, due to the dangerous situation, the American flag was raised over the school. At around 2:00 PM, she received a notice from the US consul, instructing the two Americans to leave the school as well. In order to protect the school, the two decided to stay in the school as long as possible. At around 5:00 PM, the shelling suddenly started. At that time, there were about 150 people in the school, including Chinese, most of whom were guarding the school buildings. Chinese soldiers never ambushed in the school to snipe. The Chinese soldiers did not fire at the school either. We dare to declare that until people were forced to leave by gunfire from outside the field, no Chinese soldiers were sniping in the school. After the Japanese soldiers controlled the area around the school, the shooting from the Qiujiang Road Wharf weakened, and the people decided to leave the school. At 9:00 PM, they passed through the Japanese line and safely arrived at the university's business school on Yuanmingyuan Road. Fifty workers and their families are currently staying in the school. Judging from this, the Japanese military authorities' claim that Chinese soldiers were ambushed at Shanghai University is purely to cover up their barbaric act of destroying culture.

### All Hospitals in the Northeast District Have Been Emptied

All staff and patients in the Public Works Bureau Patrol Hospital (on Huade Road in the East District) were completely evacuated yesterday. Although there were difficulties at the time, it was successfully completed. The staff and patients in the Gongji Hospital on North Suzhou Road also left last night. Currently, the staff and patients living in the Public Works Bureau's Northeast District hospitals, except for a few mentally ill patients and the staff who take care of them in the Huade Road Prison Hospital, have all been moved to safe areas.

### Inland Water Traffic is Blocked

The Report of Opening the Shanghai-Zhenjiang Route is Inaccurate

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, inland water traffic has been cut off. The report said that the Inland Water Steamboat Association is planning to open the Shanghai-Zhenjiang route, which is not accurate. According to the person in charge of the association, the association originally had considerable plans for the traffic on each line after the outbreak of the war. However, the steamboats in various places were blocked from coming to Shanghai. Therefore, so far, there is not a single small steamboat docked in Shanghai. The pre-determined plan cannot be implemented either. The association is now trying to find ways to open steamboats to Shanghai. When the time comes, the detailed methods will be announced.

### Two Typhoons in the Pacific

Moving Northwest-West; The Course is Still Unclear

Two new typhoons have risen in the Pacific. According to the Observatory's report yesterday, the first typhoon has reached 34 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees east longitude, with its center within 120 nautical miles of the reported azimuth, and its direction is unclear. The second typhoon has reached 17 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, moving northwest-west, with its center also within 120 nautical miles. The wind is moving very slowly and seems to be pushing towards our coast.

### Central Savings Association Lottery

Since the sudden outbreak of war in the city, all industries have been stagnant. Due to the lottery relationship, the Central Savings Association is still operating as usual. The number of people paying and joining the association at the association's new building at No. 1 Tianjin Road and the office on Xiafei Road was quite crowded yesterday and the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the association held a lottery at the Pudong Fellow Association on Aiduya Road. Hundreds of depositors from all walks of life attended, and directors and supervisors of the Central Trust Bureau, supervisory committee members of the association, and accountants were present to supervise. The special prize number was 3328, with a prize money of 25,834 yuan. It is heard that it was jointly won by two depositors from Guangzhou and Shanghai, Zhu and Yuan. All prizes, large and small, can be collected from today.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and the Yellow Sea are hot, and the northeast wind is changing from gentle to strong. The weather in the East China Sea is changing from hot to cloudy, and the wind direction is uncertain and sharp due to the small typhoon east of Naha moving northwest-west or northwest. There are rainstorms in the Yangtze River basin, and the wind direction is uncertain. The typhoon in the Pacific will move northwest-west. The center of the Yang wind reached within about 120 miles of 27 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM. The wind strength is unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 8.7 degrees, and the lowest was 76.5 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 90.5 degrees, and the lowest was 75.0 degrees.

### Letter

Dear Editor, We have just learned from our member, Futai Rice Shop on Fulu Road, that the newspapers of August 15 carried a news item stating that Futai Rice Shop actually stopped selling grain to the Chinese people and secretly sold it to the enemy in large quantities. We were shocked when we read it. After investigation, our rice has been sold out, and there is a Yongyi Rice Shop in Zhabei that happens to borrow a rice warehouse at No. 13 in the back lane near our shop. The people misunderstood this and wantonly destroyed it. The facts reported in the newspaper are completely inconsistent. It is a matter of business reputation. Please investigate and forward it to various newspapers for correction. According to this, our association sent personnel to investigate. According to the report of the shop, it is indeed the fact. Therefore, we have prepared a special letter to your newspaper, please correct it immediately. Sincerely, Shanghai Rice Industry Association

### Letter from Huiluo Company

A Chinese evening newspaper carried a message saying that our company had a machine gun mounted on the roof. This statement is completely false. We are deeply afraid of causing resentment among the Chinese people. Please make a statement on our behalf in your newspaper. Your newspaper can also send one or two staff members to inspect the roof of our company.

### A Glimpse of the Rear Area Sentiment Amidst the War of Resistance Against Japan (Part One of One)

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya

The Days of Liberation

"Our days of liberation are coming soon, right?"

This was a popular saying, a unanimous "sentence," that I heard everywhere after the authorities announced their determination to resist Japan following the Lugouqiao Incident. I was returning to Shanghai from Kunming in Tiannan, passing through the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.

This so-called "days of liberation," although still a hope, is not without basis, judging from the favorable public opinion and events in various quarters, especially the rear area's "unity of purpose," flourishing and vigorous, and the national spirit that seems about to unleash a flower of national liberation and freedom.

We originally knew that the ferocious demon glaring at us was none other than the enemy's voracious and shameless conspiracy, and their beastly plundering. However, we need not panic, nor need we overthink. We must further recognize the great strength that we ourselves possess, namely the 450 million people, the bullets within the nation’s ordnance pouch, and the full of hot blood that everyone has long stored to a saturation level. As long as we can launch a broad, sustained, and nationwide war of resistance, then this demon that directly endangers the life of the Chinese nation and indirectly destroys world peace and happiness will inevitably suffer an irreparable and severe lesson in the end, and reap the evil consequences of its own militarism and self-immolation through war.

Now, the prelude to the nationwide war of resistance has resolutely begun under a situation of "unbearable indignation." The heroic soldiers on the front lines, their reports of capturing generals and seizing flags, and killing the enemy to achieve results, are constantly being transmitted through newspapers. However, what is the degree of the rear area's morale, which is mutually related to and reflects the tragic and intense morale of the front lines? What kind of effect can it have? This is certainly a major issue worth noting.

The purpose of this article is to introduce more practical information in this regard. It may not be without a contribution of "drawing inferences from one instance" to the review of the rear area's lineup in this nationwide war of resistance.

Kunming, Tiannan

Let's start with Kunming, the starting point of this trip: it was originally located on the extreme border of the South, tens of thousands of miles away from North China. If North China is the current front line, then Yunnan is the current rear area. However, although the Yunnan region is in the rear area, the enthusiastic emotions repeatedly aroused by the national crisis have always been no less than those of the front lines. Especially when the Lugouqiao Incident first broke out, once it was disclosed in the local newspaper's extra edition and spread around, it did not take long for the entire city of Kunming to be shrouded in an atmosphere of grief, indignation, and excitement! The next day, raising donations for the troops, voluntarily contributing one day's income, increasing public servants' duties and student military training were all rapidly emerging facts.

At the same time, some stores in the market that also sold silk and linen fabrics made by the enemy, as well as stalls selling scattered enemy goods such as "Wei Huo 'San Dan' bedbug insecticide" and "Eastern toys," have successively discovered a gift like "gold from heaven." It was not a warning letter, nor was it a bomb, but a "canned food" of human excrement that was extremely easy to splash and volatilize. Those who received it truly had the feeling of "unable to refuse, yet ashamed to accept."

Some young students have automatically gone to the countryside to do propaganda work. Liang Mochen, the commander of the artillery regiment in Wujia Chang (twenty miles south of the city), even saw a tall and upright young man with a loud voice giving a speech to countless graves on a tomb dam. The etiquette and titles were the same as in a meeting hall, attracting many villagers to surround him on the left, right, and rear in a large arc. When Liang first saw him, he thought he was mentally ill, but after hearing him mention in fragments that "if the enemy country implements its southward policy, Yunnan will not be spared," he concluded that he was a patriotic youth. Whether the young man's technique of publicizing the national crisis was appropriate or not, we can put aside for the moment, but the importance that Yunnan youth attaches to the national crisis can be seen from this.

However, the methods of the rear area to cope with the national crisis are certainly far from enough based solely on the above-mentioned social phenomena. What is the Yunnan government's response situation? This is certainly a topic that should be written about.

I believe that the greatest responsibilities of the rear area authorities during the outbreak of the war can be summarized into two items: ㊀ to provide the front lines with as much material and manpower as possible, and ㊁ to strive to maintain local security. Yunnan is rich in products and can still maintain a state of "self-sufficiency." All military and political power within Gansu province is concentrated in the hands of Provincial Chairman and Pacification Director Long Zhi Zhou. All administrative and military affairs are carried out effectively, and the results are considerable. The reporter has met with Mr. Long several times. His view on the Sino-Japanese problem is that sooner or later, a war is inevitable. Although Japan is a strong country, as long as China can wage a protracted war, it will not hesitate to exhaust all its material and human resources. When the fierce fighting has reached a considerable degree, causing the enemy's combat power to be exhausted, the final victory will ultimately belong to us. However, at this critical moment of national survival, regardless of distance, regardless of age, everyone should contribute everything they have to the country in order to strengthen the power of a sustained war of resistance.

In addition, on the day before I was about to leave Kunming, at the "Number One Hot Spring in the World" in Anning, I also met Mr. Lu Shui Heng, the current Provincial Party Committee member and right-hand man of Mr. Long. He also said: Yunnan is connected to the British and French territories and is fortunate to be at peace. All of the tens of thousands of regular troops are always preparing for battle, ready to serve on the front lines of the war of resistance. As long as the central government's order for deployment arrives in the morning, they can be mobilized to the north in the evening. As for the responsibility for the security of the province, it will be borne by the standing teams in each county, so there is no need to worry. Afterwards, I also met with Chief of the General Staff Liao Pin Zhuo and Division Commander Zhang Yun Peng, and learned that the attitude of the general soldiers in Yunnan province closely matched the sentiments expressed by Mr. Long and Mr. Lu. From my observation, I see that in recent years, Yunnan province has implemented conscription and strict training. Soldiers who have completed their two-year term of service and retired still receive subsidies to support local security. In addition, there have been no natural disasters for many years, and the rice harvest has been abundant. The general social economy is relatively well-off. Therefore, the above-mentioned authorities' willingness to devote all the province's human and material resources to jointly overcome the national crisis is indeed a sincere and responsible statement.
