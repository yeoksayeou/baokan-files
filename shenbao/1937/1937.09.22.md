### Our Troops Defend the Original Line of Defense, Fierce Fighting in Villages East of Luodian Yesterday

The enemy's advance on the area of Houjiazhai was repelled by our forces.  The enemy launched multiple attacks on the Zhabei area, all of which suffered disastrous defeats.  Our artillery positions in Pudong shelled the vicinity of the enemy's consulate.

This newspaper received the following confirmed battle reports from the front line last night: ⑴ Southeast of the Municipal Government, the enemy forces had built field artillery positions. Starting from around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, they jointly shelled our positions near Jiangwan.  Due to the lack of targets, all the shells landed in the fields. Our military positions suffered no damage. ⑵ Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, enemy infantry of five to six hundred men were discovered east of Fudan University.  Enemy infantry of three to four hundred men were also present east of the Jiangwan Ye Family Garden.  In addition, there were six enemy mortars and more than ten tanks east of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, seemingly with some intentions. ⑶ The enemy forces in the Yanghang area launched an attack on our positions near Yangjiufang starting from 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, but they were bravely repelled by our troops, with dozens of enemy soldiers killed or wounded. ⑷ In the Luodian area, since yesterday morning, the enemy forces launched fierce attacks on our positions near Houjiazhai, Jinjiazhai, and Gongjiazhai.  Our troops initially responded calmly and then engaged in trench warfare.  Fierce fighting continued until 3:00 PM that day (the 21st).  The enemy forces suffered extremely heavy casualties, and our certain brigade also suffered casualties. ⑸ The enemy forces facing our certain army on the front lines have been repeatedly subjected to surprise attacks by our troops in the past two days, suffering extremely heavy damage and casualties of over two thousand men. Therefore, starting from yesterday afternoon, the enemy no longer dared to advance, and the number of their artillery pieces has also decreased. In addition, a large number of wounded enemy soldiers were seen facing our certain division, being transported from Fang, and many donkeys and horses were moving eastward from the north of Luodian Town, presumably due to the frustration of continuous attacks, and there is a new plan.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: Aviation sources report that residents who escaped from Gouqi Mountain, which belongs to Chongming County, said that a Japanese cruiser and a destroyer were anchored west of Gouqi Mountain. Marines landed and strafed the islanders. Except for a portion who fled to Shengshan, the rest were arrested. The situation is tense.

Military News: The enemy forces successively attempted to carry out a central breakthrough in Luodian and Taxiing, but were met with a head-on blow by our troops and have not succeeded so far. In recent days, the enemy has concentrated a large force in the downtown area, attempting to advance on Jiangwan. However, our troops in that area have strong forces and are heavily guarded. If the enemy attacks, they will definitely suffer heavy losses.

### Five Hand-to-Hand Combat Engagements with the Enemy in the Luodian Area

After suffering repeated heavy blows, the enemy in the Luodian area, although awaiting reinforcements and replenishment, dared not launch a major attack, but has continued to make trouble in recent days. However, our troops have given them a head-on blow each time and launched fierce counterattacks, and are still ensuring the original line of defense and maintaining strict vigilance. It is reliably known that on the afternoon of the 19th, enemy bombers dropped bombs for a long time over the Yangjia Village and Sucun areas, three kilometers north of Caowang Temple in the northwest of Luodian. In the evening, more than ten enemy artillery pieces fiercely bombarded the Shenjia Village, about two kilometers east of Sucun, and the Gushou Village to its north, firing countless shells. At around 11:00 PM, a sudden night attack was launched, with forces of one battalion or more advancing on our Sucun and Gushou Villages. Our troops were prepared and immediately dispatched elite troops to launch a head-on counterattack. The soldiers were exceptionally brave, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat up to five times. The enemy formation was disrupted and fled in disarray. Our troops did not pursue and continued to defend the line of Sucun, Gushou Village, Jiangzhai, and Xisongzhai.

In the northwest of Luodian, there was fierce fighting late at night. Enemy aircraft bombed our military positions in Yangjia Village and Sucun, about three kilometers north of the Chaowang Temple, very intensely from the afternoon. Our military positions in Gushou Village, north of Sucun, were also the target of concentrated enemy artillery fire. Most of the enemy artillery positions were located in Shenjia Village, about two kilometers east of Sucun, and the artillery fire they fired was more than a thousand rounds, bombarding until about 11:00 PM at night. The enemy's infantry began to move, with an estimated force of more than one large detachment fiercely advancing on our Sucun and Gushou Villages. Our troops stood firm and did not retreat. In order to give a head-on blow, they also dispatched a considerable force, leaping out of the trenches to counterattack, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat more than five times. Under our fierce counterattack, the enemy suffered casualties all over the field, and the remaining enemy soldiers who were defeated were in a terrible state. Our line of Sucun, Gushou Village, Jiangzhai, and Xisongzhai is exceptionally solid. Yesterday afternoon, enemy artillery bombarded the area around that line again, and our artillery units also returned fire. Last night, a small group of enemy soldiers attempted to attack and harass, and most of them were routed, while the rest were annihilated by our forces.

### Enemy Attack on Liuhang Repelled Again

The enemy forces have repeatedly attacked our Liuhang, attempting to break through our central line of defense. In recent days, they have been repelled. Fierce fighting broke out in the area of Jialongnong on the 19th, from morning to night. The enemy forces concentrated their artillery fire, fiercely bombarding our positions near Doujialongnong, Mengwan, and Wangjiufang, and constantly sent multiple aircraft to reconnoiter our positions. In the evening, their infantry, under the cover of artillery fire, advanced on us. Our troops bravely fought back, fighting bloody battles all night, and finally repelled the enemy. At dawn the day before yesterday, traces of the enemy were found again in our positions in the Chenzhai, Wangzhai, and Yangjiufang areas, and they attacked us. Our troops responded calmly until noon, when the enemy could not withstand it and retreated one after another. The day before last night, the enemy joined reinforcements in the Jialongnong area, and fierce fighting broke out all night until dawn yesterday morning, when the enemy was forced to retreat.

Central News Agency, Military News: Our troops in the Liuhang area have won another major victory recently. After the enemy forces in that area were defeated by us on the 17th, they advanced on our positions with heavy forces from the Yanghang area on the 19th. Our troops responded calmly, and the two sides bombarded each other with heavy artillery and machine guns, and the fierce fighting did not stop for two days and nights. On the afternoon of the 20th, our troops took advantage of the enemy's exhaustion and fatigue, leaping out of the trenches, bravely charging and launching a white-blade bloody battle. The enemy forces could not withstand it and retreated. In this battle, the enemy forces suffered more than 2,000 casualties. As a result, the front line became quiet again yesterday, and the artillery fire gradually became sparse. At the same time, the enemy forces in the Luodian area also moved eastward, seemingly to reinforce the Yanghang side.

### Enemy Attack on Zhabei Suffers Heavy Losses

The enemy forces who have been trapped in the Zhabei to Jiangwan line for 40 days have not only made no progress, but are also becoming increasingly exhausted. If the war effort and morale had not shifted to the Luodian coastal area, the enemy forces in that area would probably have been wiped out by our troops long ago. Although the fighting on that line has continued without stopping in recent days, it has all been skirmishes between outposts, with no fierce battles. At dawn the day before yesterday, the enemy again used five tanks as a vanguard, covering more than 400 infantrymen, and launched a dawn attack on our Dijiabang area along the Tiyuhui Road and the vicinity of Zhoujiazhai. At the same time, the enemy artillery units also fired fiercely, and used a small number of troops to harass the left and right wings of that section in an attempt to achieve their dream of breaking through our defense line in that section. After our troops bravely fought back, the enemy's five tanks suffered heavy damage from the concentrated fire of our flat-trajectory guns, small steel cannons, and machine guns. After fierce fighting for an hour, the enemy finally could not withstand it and retreated in panic, and more than half of the 400-odd infantrymen they covered were killed or wounded. The enemy attacked several times the night before last morning, but gained nothing.

### Enemy's Attempt to Invade Pudong Becomes More Urgent

First, reconnaissance by low-flying air force, then artillery fire, our artillery counterattack hits near the Japanese consulate.

Yesterday at 4:00 PM, several enemy aircraft reconnoitered at low altitude in Pudong for several weeks, and at about 4:45 PM, enemy warships anchored off the Waibaidu Bridge in Pudong also fired on our Pudong side. Our artillery also immediately opened fire to return fire. Several shells hit near the Japanese consulate, and it immediately caught fire. About twenty minutes later, the sound of artillery fire subsided.

Yesterday afternoon at 4:36 PM, an enemy gunboat rushed from the Yangshupu side to under the Baidu Bridge. At that time, the tide was rising. The ship anchored in the center of the river in front of Lujiazui, with the bow facing the Chunjiang Wharf. It was seen that there were many navy personnel wearing white uniforms running back and forth from the lower cabin to the second and third deck platforms, working very busily. However, observing the situation, it seemed that there was a plan to attack Pudong and plot to smuggle ashore. It took dozens of minutes to park the ship properly, and then most of the soldiers hid in the ship's cabin. The enemy Ship No. 13 was anchored in front of the middle wharf, and the Izumo Ship No. 2 River Tube was anchored to coordinate.

Since the enemy's repeated attempts to land in Pudong have failed, it has been rumored for several days that they will launch a large-scale invasion in the near future in order to eliminate the serious threat posed by our artillery to the Japanese warships, and to take a large amount of coal stored in the Japanese docks along the shore, and then attempt to advance. Unexpectedly, our side discerned their conspiracy and prepared sufficient strong forces and built strong fortifications in advance, so that the enemy's dream of landing became a bubble. And they also knew that they could not easily attack our defense line, so the most tense period in the past five days has become quiet, and there has been no fierce action day and night. Although Japanese aircraft sometimes use machine guns to strafe civilians and throw bombs, and there are intermittent artillery battles between the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River and our artillery, they are all irrelevant to the overall situation, and our troops have not suffered any damage. Since the night before last until this morning, our troops have been waiting in battle formation at all ports along the shore, and it seems that there is no possibility of conflict. According to general observation, the enemy's plan to attack Pudong has not been abandoned, and they have been busy preparing for the past few days.

### Enemy Warships on the Huangpu River Come and Go in a Hurry

Before dawn yesterday morning, three enemy cruisers of more than 10,000 tons sailed to Songkou and are now anchored on the Yangtze River surface outside Songkou, their names being Nino, one Yrno, and the other unknown. All three ships have a dark gray hull, each with three funnels, and two white stripes on the funnels. It is thought that they are carrying enemy reinforcements to Shanghai. In addition, an enemy Red Cross ship also arrived at the same time, also anchored on the river surface outside Songkou, with the ship name American, presumably preparing to carry enemy wounded soldiers back to their country.

### Enemy Forces Arrive with Another Large Batch of Military Supplies

The total number of enemy transport ships that have successively sailed to Shanghai in recent days has reached more than 50. Apart from a portion used to carry enemy reinforcements to Shanghai, most of them are used to load enemy military supplies and military necessities. Therefore, the enemy's replenishment of military equipment has been quite substantial recently. Currently, the warehouses and wharfs of Osaka, Huangpu, China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf, North Wharf, Huishan are all piled up with enemy military supplies, and enemy trucks come and go to transport them to various places, which is very busy. As for the enemy Kiyokawamaru, Fifth Unkai Maru, Boryo Maru, and another unnamed transport ship, etc. that sailed to Shanghai successively before, they have left Shanghai one after another and returned to Japan the night before last. And the Liangyou Maru, which was docked at the chemical machine of the China Merchants Bureau, hastily unloaded the military supplies and a large batch of green military vehicles in the heavy rain yesterday, and also sailed out of Songkou yesterday afternoon. Currently, only one enemy transport ship, Chishima Maru, is docked in the Huangpu River, docked at the Huangpu Wharf, and has not yet sailed out. The rest have all sailed out of Songkou and returned to Japan, it is said.

### Enemy Threatens with Air Raids on the Capital, Further Arousing Our Ambition to Kill the Enemy

North China Daily News published a fair editorial yesterday, enemy wants us to kneel is like a fool's dream.

The North China Daily News published an editorial yesterday, discussing the incident of the commander of the Third Fleet of Japan, Hasegawa Kiyoshi, using aircraft to bomb Nanjing, saying: "The formal notification of all countries by Vice Admiral Hasegawa regarding the Japanese navy's air force to Nanjing, viewed from the perspective of Nanjing being constantly subjected to Japanese air raids, seems to be a precursor to a special and extensive sky operation by the Japanese army. The Nanjing government calmly handled this notification and did not make any complaints, which is enough to encourage the resistance of the Chinese troops around Shanghai or in the interior against Japanese aggression. All sources prove that the government is now relying on political unity that has never been achieved before, and is unusually stable. This government and the people may be grateful to Japan for this."

Hasegawa's remarks, if interpreted correctly, seem to indicate that the hope of the Japanese side for this move is to drastically shake the morale of the Chinese army, thereby disintegrating the government and causing consequences favorable to the Japanese side. Whether this speculation can be realized will be seen in the results of this sky offensive. In fact, the impressions felt by those who come and go among the Chinese people in Shanghai and other places dare not flatter the expectations of the Japanese. Looking at the brave soldiers on the battlefield, fighting so loyally, and the general public, enduring the dangers in the sky and the hardships of displacement with such perseverance, if the leaders in Nanjing are less courageous than them, then the expectations of the Japanese will eventually become a dream. There is something very noteworthy: the victims of this war know very well the reasons for their families being destroyed and their property being lost.

They have never complained about the government, and all attribute it to Japanese aggression. The Japanese senior commanders are planning to back up the goals of the Japanese in China described by Prime Minister Konoe. The righteous indignation of the Chinese people is indeed a point that they should deeply consider. The shells of Japanese warships and the bombs of aircraft seem to leave resentment in the hearts of the Chinese people for a long time, making economic cooperation and friendship between China and Japan in the future silent. The Japanese army's large-scale sky offensive may achieve the rapid results hoped for by Hasegawa, but even if it is achieved, it is still a question whether these results will exceed the limits of the Chinese people's grief and endurance, and the results will be counterproductive.

The Japanese army is advancing with the times, constantly destroying life and property with brutality. This unconscious action seems to be entering people's hearts deeper and deeper. According to reliable news from Japan, although the Japanese people have patriotic enthusiasm, they have presented a kind of unshakeable hesitation towards the policies of their government. This is because these policies are only showing the most arbitrary aggression against the country that shares the reputation of leader of Eastern civilization with Japan, and there is no other clear expression. Driven by the urgent propaganda of its military, the Japanese leaders extremely despise the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army, and ignore any suggestions that the Japanese army may encounter significant losses in the Shanghai campaign. In the future, when the truth is revealed and can no longer be concealed, the Japanese government may be trapped in a difficult position where it cannot advance or retreat. Even within the Japanese military, there are differing opinions on whether this war is worthwhile. Generally, cautious soldiers deeply worry that this campaign will weaken the ability to deal with car changes in the Russian border area in the future, while those who advocate using troops to invade China say that most of the troops sent to China today are reserve soldiers. As for the elite of the Japanese army and all kinds of the latest military equipment, they are all reserved for use in greater events in the future. This kind of self-decoration cannot make people feel at ease. Even if their statement is true, the land and naval forces are ultimately limited and cannot be consumed for a long time without being exhausted. Moreover, the military expenditure is huge and the debt is high, and it will eventually reach a level where it cannot be at peace. These matters mentioned above are more worthy of attention than the development of this war, which is so complex, in its early stages. The war was initially limited to a corner of Pingjin, but today it has spread to the entire China. Japan has a firm determination to plot China, and now it is intensifying its strong attack plan, and is targeting Nanjing as the goal of its orderly destruction. This move, in addition to the military purposes that have already been implemented, will inevitably destroy the civil construction in that place. China may become even poorer as a result, so Japan's adventurous actions have no economic benefits to be gained, and the Japanese army must suffer significant losses in order to achieve the destructive results it needs, which is self-evident.

In this environment, it is requested that Japanese politicians with relatively clear heads think a step back about the overall situation and the plain facts, and pull back from the brink. Is it really as ineffective as people say? Even if the Chinese army's resistance can suddenly disintegrate within a week, Japan will still have a very important problem to be decided in order to make the gains of the troops commensurate with the efforts it has already consumed on the Chinese coast. If the war continues to drag on and the Japanese army continues to strive to achieve the work of "making China kneel," and it is said that this problem can ultimately be solved, then it is like a fool's dream. The technique of intimidation can overcome the physical strength of those who are hit, but its reward will inevitably create a spiritual resistance in the soul of those who are hit, which cannot be overcome. Can Japan accept this kind of suffering? (The following is omitted)

"Translator's note: The North China Daily News always earnestly advises that China and Japan should turn hostility into friendship and jointly seek the welfare of the people when discussing the Sino-Japanese War. The author is in a third-party position and makes these remarks, and the benevolence and goodwill are commendable. However, we have already suffered an unprecedented catastrophe due to Japanese aggression, with countless deaths and injuries, and the devastation of the land, which has aroused the anger of both humans and gods and the sympathy of the whole world. And that brutal enemy wants to strike us until we kneel before stopping. We will have no peace until the aggressor can no longer aggress against us. At this time, publicizing peace is a waste of ink. The last paragraph of this article again advises China and Japan to join hands as soon as possible, so it is omitted."

### Enemy's Intimidation Tactics Fail, Foreigners in the Capital Have No Intention of Evacuating

British warships will continue to dock as usual, the Soviet ambassador will not move.

The North China Daily News said that after the commander of the Third Fleet of Japan, Hasegawa, issued a threat to bomb Nanjing and take other offensive methods, the embassies of Britain, the United States, and other countries in Nanjing have not yet decided whether to move out of Nanjing. Except for the Americans, foreigners in Nanjing did not express their attitude yesterday (the 20th). (However, the Soviet embassy has declared that it will not move.) The commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Vice Admiral Yarnell, sent a letter to Hasegawa, stating that as long as the U.S. embassy and any U.S. citizens remain in Nanjing, the U.S. gunboats Luzon and Guam in Nanjing must not leave for a day. Yarnell sent this letter on the evening of the 21st, stating that the Japanese consul general forwarded a notification, saying that the Japanese navy's air force will bomb Nanjing after 12:00 noon on the 21st, and advising foreign warships to move to the upper reaches of Nanjing. The U.S. gunboats Luzon and Guam are currently anchored in the river, alongside the hulks of the Taikoo Company. The U.S. ambassador has instructed that as long as any Americans remain in Nanjing for one day, the two ships must also remain docked for one day. The upper layers of the two ships are covered with U.S. flags, which are easy to identify. Please issue the necessary orders to the Japanese navy's air force to be careful not to drop bombs near the two ships. If the Japanese army's aircraft intends to drop bombs near that place, please issue the same order for the country, etc. It is heard that the British and German embassies are still staying in Nanjing, and the French embassy also intends to do so, but is waiting for clear instructions from its government. The North China Daily News now has reason to believe that British warships will also continue to dock as usual. The women and children of the British embassy are currently being moved, but all male staff members intend to stay in the embassy. The British warships Grate and Bee, which are currently in Nanjing, will stay to protect the British expatriates in Nanjing.

Shanghai Qin Wu Shang Pao said that the naval commanders-in-chief of Britain, France, and the United States stationed in the Far East have both replied to Hasegawa, commander of the Third Fleet of Japan, refusing the application to move foreign warships anchored in Nanjing to the upper reaches of South East China. There is currently one British cruiser and two gunboats in Southern China, and France has one gunboat. Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Japanese embassy in this city claimed that Japan will certainly do its best to protect the lives and property of foreigners, but after Japan issued a warning about the bombing of Nanjing, it cannot be responsible for foreigners who still reside in Nanjing.

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury said that The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury received reliable news last night that the U.S. Ambassador Johnson and about ten members of the embassy staff and employees boarded the flagship Luzon of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet at 9:00 PM on the 20th, preparing to sail to Wuhu. Another U.S. ship, Guam, is also preparing to leave Nanjing, leaving only Second Secretary Paxton to represent the U.S. government in Nanjing. As for the seventeen U.S. civilians traveling in Nanjing, they will stay in Nanjing temporarily with Paxton. It is not known whether they did not have the opportunity to leave Nanjing on the two ships, or whether they were unwilling to abandon their families and businesses. The diplomatic community in Nanjing was greatly surprised last night when they heard the news of the U.S. ambassador and his staff leaving Nanjing. The British, French, and German embassies were particularly uneasy. The three embassies are currently not moving. It is said that Johnson is the leader of the diplomatic corps in Nanjing, and his sudden move is unexpected. It is heard that the Chinese authorities also do not understand the U.S. ambassador's decision. The Luzon and Guam were still anchored in the Xiaguan River at midnight yesterday. As for Paxton's main responsibility for staying in Nanjing, it is to ensure that the U.S. embassy's flag is still flying. Those who agree with Paxton include Associated Press reporter McDonald Daniels and his wife. It is heard that they moved in last night. In addition, there are two American reporters. It is heard that several American female teachers at Jinling University have decided to stay in Nanjing and will not move.

The American-owned Shanghai Evening Post said that Vice Admiral Yarnell, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, told a reporter from The American-owned Shanghai Evening Post today that the United States has decided to leave the two gunboats Luzon and Guam in their current position, that is, outside the hulks of the Taikoo Company. The Luzon will listen to the dispatch of the U.S. Ambassador Nelson. Although the U.S. ambassador has temporarily moved his office to the Luzon, the ship is not sailing elsewhere. However, since the ship is under the dispatch of the ambassador, the movement will be determined by the ambassador. From the appearance of the phenomenon, the U.S. ambassador's move to move the majority of his staff to the ship to work is out of his own initiative. Judging from the telegrams from Washington, the U.S. ambassador's actions have been approved by the U.S. government. It is now believed that the U.S. ambassador's move is not for his personal safety, but to avoid unfortunate incidents with Japan that would damage relations like the British and Japanese.

Enemy Planes Also Drop Bombs in Shengze - and Attack Passenger Cars in Jiaxing

### Japan Threatens to Bomb Nanjing - Britain and the United States Warn Japan

Should Compensate for Loss of Life and Property - Japan's Unreasonable Demands Have Been Rejected by Britain

[London] Japan's threat to launch a large-scale bombing of Nanjing has aroused the greatest attention since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Telegram)

[London] Today, Britain instructed Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, to protest Japan's threat to bomb Nanjing. It is reported that the content of the protest is that this action by Japan may harm non-military institutions and civilian lives. If British lives and property are damaged, Japan should be held responsible. (21st National Telegram)

[Washington] Acting Secretary of State Moore stated today that the US Ambassador to China, Johnson, had long been instructed by the government that if the safety of embassy personnel was threatened, they could withdraw from the embassy at any time. Therefore, Johnson and the embassy personnel's move to board the USS Luzon was considered to be in complete accordance with the government's instructions. Moore solemnly declared that the State Department does not consider Johnson's actions as abandoning the Nanjing embassy or the qualifications of the US representative in China, as it is only temporary in nature. Moore also summoned the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, today before the time that Japan claimed it would begin bombing Nanjing. Afterward, neither Moore nor Saito made any statements, but because the timing of the summons was quite coincidental, it is generally believed that the bombing of Nanjing was discussed. Officials at the State Department also do not hide their anxiety about Japan's attempt to extensively destroy Nanjing. It is likely that Moore warned Saito, urging him to pay attention to the huge American property and interests in Nanjing. (20th National Telegram)

[London] Regarding the case of the attack on British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft, American political figures recently stated that the Japanese government will issue a formal reply within days, the content of which is reportedly favorable. At this time, the evolution of the Far East Incident, especially Japan's request that British officials, civilians, and warships leave Nanjing, has caused great concern to the British side. Japan should make amends to Britain in the Knatchbull-Hugessen case as soon as possible so that the anxious mood can be slightly alleviated. As for Japan's request, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Herbert Wood, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet, Vice Admiral Charles Little, have rejected it. Upon hearing the news, British political figures expressed strong approval and said that Japan's request was completely unreasonable. The British side will never recognize Japan's right to issue orders or make recommendations to the British authorities within the territory of a third country. Therefore, although Herbert Wood and Charles Little's decision was not instructed by London in advance, the government will definitely approve it. (Central News Agency 20th Havas Telegram)

[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun evening edition reported that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito met with US Undersecretary of State Moore on the night of the 20th at Moore's invitation and held secret talks for 30 minutes. Both sides kept the talks secret. It is reported that Moore said that if the American ambassador and expatriates in Nanjing took refuge on a warship and the warship was bombed, American public opinion would be even more unfavorable to Japan. He asked Japan to pay attention and said that if American property was damaged, Japan should be held liable for compensation. Furthermore, the Nichi Nichi Shimbun evening edition reported that the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet replied to the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, Hasegawa, saying please do not drop bombs near American warships. The British fleet commander replied in the same way. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)

[Tokyo] Today, according to sources, the Japanese military's plan to launch a large-scale bombing of Nanjing is to be slightly delayed. (21st National Telegram)

### Japan Warns of Air Raids on the Capital - Our Side Has Made Full Preparations

US Ambassador Plans to Go to Wuhu by Ship - Temporarily Suspended - Other Countries' Envoys Still Working in Nanjing as Usual - British Newspapers Believe US Ambassador's Action is Tantamount to Selling Out Friendship

[Nanjing] Since the Japanese military announced that officials and civilians of various countries in Nanjing must withdraw from Nanjing by a certain date, the military and civilians of Nanjing have dealt with it calmly. Their hatred of the enemy has become stronger. A reporter visited Mayor Ma Chaojun and asked about the latest measures. Ma first strongly condemned the enemy's barbaric actions. He then said that Nanjing has made full preparations in terms of transportation, food, drinking water, and fire protection, which are sufficient to cope with all difficulties. Ma finally praised the attitude of some of the elderly, weak, women, and children who remained in Nanjing to leave calmly, and all the young men in Nanjing who firmly expressed their willingness to remain in Nanjing to assist the government.

[Nanjing] The American gunboat USS Luzon sailed towards the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this morning carrying personnel from the American embassy, ​​but the gunboat USS Guam is still anchored at Xiaguan. The American embassy has also sent 18 people, including Paxton, to stay behind. However, as of 3 PM, Japanese planes had not yet arrived. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Telegram)

[Nanjing] The flagship of the American Yangtze River Fleet, USS Luzon, is scheduled to carry American Ambassador to China Johnson and embassy staff and refugees to Wuhu for a temporary stay at 11 AM this morning. Second Secretary of the American Embassy Buxton and seventeen Americans will still remain in Nanjing. (21st National Telegram)

[Nanjing] The Chinese authorities are extremely indignant at the decision of the American embassy staff to withdraw from Nanjing, because the United States has always refused various requests from China, such as American warships in the Huangpu River in Shanghai not being moored near Japanese warships. As for Japan's wishes, they are more than happy to cater to them. The long-standing friendship of the Chinese people with the United States has now been betrayed, and President Roosevelt even has a unilateral ban on the transportation of arms to the Far East. Seeing this situation, all sectors of the Chinese community are openly hinting at possible retaliatory plans. Chinese newspapers are also extremely resentful. The Chinese authorities issued a semi-official statement tonight, strongly condemning the decision of the American embassy. At the same time, they expressed their appreciation for the reply from the naval commanders of Britain, France, and the United States to Hasegawa rejecting his request that foreign warships in Nanjing be moved to the upper reaches of the river. In their reply, the American commander asked Hasegawa to inform Japanese planes not to affect the American warships USS Luzon and USS Guam anchored in Nanjing. The British and French replies stated that if British and French people were injured or killed in the air raids by Japanese planes, the Japanese side would be held responsible. Central News Agency 20th Reuters Telegram)

[London] According to the Daily Express, after Japan threatened to bomb Nanjing in order to end the Sino-Japanese War quickly, Chinese officials were not shaken at all. Although the Nanjing authorities are fully aware of the dangers of air raids, they are determined not to be intimidated by Japan or feel panicked. According to the Chinese authorities, the damage caused by the Japanese air raids in the past two days has not been serious, which proves that China's aviation facilities can cope with the Japanese air raids. At the same time, the shelters in Nanjing have been completed in a short period of time. As of now, only the American embassy, ​​which is the embassy of the United States in Nanjing, has accepted the Japanese threats. All the staff of the American embassy have moved to the American gunboat "Luzon" to work, and have sailed to the upper reaches of the river. Nanjing officials believe that the American embassy's move is tantamount to "selling out Sino-American friendship." This move has increased the anger of the Chinese people over the United States' announcement of an arms embargo. (21st National Telegram)

[Nanjing] Regarding the Japanese announcement that foreign diplomats and expatriates in Nanjing must leave Nanjing before noon on the 21st, according to an investigation by a reporter from this agency, only the American embassy accepted this request, and the rest ignored it. Soviet Union, British, German, Belgian, French, and Italian embassy personnel continued to stay in Nanjing today to handle official business. Even the American embassy has one secretary who is unwilling to leave and voluntarily stays at the embassy. The rest accompanied Johnson before the Japanese deadline on the morning of the 21st. The ship went west and was temporarily suspended (Central News Agency on the 21st)

[Nanjing] According to well-informed sources in Haitong, the German Embassy in China will remain in Nanjing and will not move unless Berlin issues a contrary instruction. According to German expatriates in Nanjing, except for those who had already left Nanjing due to business, there are still about 100 people. 15 of them (mostly women and children) left Beijing last night.

### Our Army Fights Bravely Against the Enemy - The Japanese Government Is Increasingly Anxious

German Doubts Have Arisen About Japan - British Newspaper's Diplomatic Reporter's Powerful Account

[London] Menchesde's authoritative diplomatic reporter, on the basis of information and opinions from various sensitive sources, made a general account, saying that the Chinese people have shown their characteristics, which, although expected by people here, are now making the Japanese government very anxious. Even some Japanese military leaders, who are confident that Japan will win, are deeply troubled by the resistance of the Chinese, which has forced Japan to use a stronger force than originally planned. Japan originally intended to occupy Shanghai with a very small force and devote all its efforts to the northern battlefield, but the resistance of the Chinese army in Shanghai has reduced the Japanese troops that can be used in the north. Japan's victory in North China, even if possible, will inevitably be achieved at a huge price. German observers are now unable to avoid doubting the confidence of the Japanese military authorities that Japan's occupation of North China will weaken the Soviet Union's power in the Far East. The Germans believe that even if Japan obtains a better position on the military road than it does now, its strength is still far inferior to that of the Soviet Union. General opinion in London believes that if Japan had not challenged China, China's unity would never have been as strong as it is today, and even collapse. But today it is not the case. Many believe that China's unity, promoted by greater efficiency in industrialization and administration and the great talent of Chairman Chiang, will be even more excited by the war against Japan.

### League of Nations General Assembly Opens, Litvinov Criticizes Aggressor Nations

Requests League of Nations Assistance for China and Spain; Australian Representative Proposes International Peace Conference

[Geneva] Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov spoke at the League of Nations General Assembly today, vehemently condemning aggressor nations, saying that two member states of the League of Nations have been innocently invaded, one in southwestern Europe and one in Asia. The latter is China, which was suddenly attacked by Japan without any legitimate reason, blockading its coast and invading its territory with hundreds of thousands of troops, bringing a major global commercial center to a standstill. This kind of action, we see now, is only the beginning. Mr. Litvinov continued, "We cannot help but express reservations when discussing non-intervention in Spain. The three countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations have all attacked other countries in recent years. They have revived the most barbaric of ideas from the long-vanished Dark Ages. Undeclared wars exist on both continents today. If the League of Nations constantly shirks its obligations, it will not be able to maintain its existence. The League of Nations can provide greater assistance than Spain and China have requested. The League of Nations has now received requests for assistance from two invaded member states, regretting only that the United States is not a member state. This application will put the League of Nations to a severe test, but the League of Nations should not shirk responsibility. We firmly believe that if the League of Nations adopts a firm policy in the case of aggression, all other cases can be easily resolved." Australian representative Bruce then took the floor, suggesting that the League of Nations should convene a conference of countries most concerned with the Far East to discuss a solution or unified action. All plans that seem necessary and are in accordance with international norms for the conference should be considered, and non-League members related to the Far East should be consulted at length. Bruce also spoke of the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant regarding actions the League of Nations should take, saying that nothing could be more detrimental to the League of Nations' prestige and future well-being than for the League of Nations to attempt to delay or shelve the current dispute in a meaningless way, merely stating the League of Nations' attitude and position. For the sake of the League of Nations' honor and long-term interests, China must not be misled into believing that it can rely on assistance that is not guaranteed. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)

[Geneva] Australian representative Bruce suggested to the League of Nations General Assembly today that Article 11 of the Covenant should be invoked to convene a conference of member states and non-member states such as the United States to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue in order to end the war. Bruce also stated that the League of Nations' weakness has rendered sanctions against Japan ineffective. (21st, National Telegraph)

⊙Geneva At the League of Nations General Assembly this morning, after Australian representative Bruce delivered a speech, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov spoke, stating in summary: "Since the League of Nations General Assembly adjourned last year, aggressive actions have not only not ceased, but have even expanded. The war of aggression in Spain has not stopped, and now it is augmented by the war of aggression in the Far East. There has been a prevailing opinion within the League of Nations that if the aggressor is not a member of the League of Nations, then the League of Nations cannot intervene in such aggressive acts. This view is a grave error, as can be demonstrated by the Spanish case. The Spanish case was not submitted to the League of Nations for handling, but to the London Non-Intervention Committee for handling. But the result is already known to everyone. The non-intervention agreement regarding the Spanish Civil War was broken shortly after it was signed. In short, the London Adjustment Committee failed to achieve its original purpose, as it was established for the convenience of non-League of Nations members. From this perspective, those who advocate the universalization of the League of Nations should give it careful consideration. Conversely, if various international conferences and the countries participating in them all share the ideal of peace and are united, then the success of such conferences is often very rapid. The Montreal Conference last year and the Nyon Conference this year are examples of this." Litvinov then vehemently attacked Italy, Germany, and Japan, saying that they had abandoned the ideal of peace and did not respect the independence of various nations. "These aggressor nations often claim to be fighting against communism, but their true purpose is to acquire minerals and markets to promote the sale of their own country's goods. Has the Soviet Union ever refused to trade with various countries? Even with countries whose political systems are mutually opposed, has the Soviet Union ever refused to trade with them? No! What's more, the aggressor nations' so-called anti-communism slogan is aimed not only at the Soviet Union but also at other countries. They often claim that democratic countries are now on the eve of Bolshevization. It is even more absurd to say that the Soviet Union is determined to conquer Spain. What the Soviet Union seeks is to allow various nations to freely decide their internal political systems. Although the Soviet government does not recognize equal rights for both sides in the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union has accepted all the agreements proposed by the London Adjustment Committee, including the proposal to withdraw foreign volunteers from Spain. If one were to therefore assume that the Soviet Union is weak and can be bullied, that would be a grave error. As of today, the so-called threat to peace is no longer a question, as peace has already been broken." In addition, Litvinov said in his speech that it was a great pity that the United States had not joined the League of Nations. Litvinov then discussed the issue of revising the League of Nations Covenant, saying, "Several member states of the League of Nations advocate universalizing the Covenant. Their main intention is to prevent the three countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations, Germany, Italy, and Japan, from being excluded from the League of Nations if the Covenant is revised. However, we must know that if the Covenant is revised, it must be strengthened before it can be effective. The League of Nations still has sufficient effectiveness, as can be demonstrated by two current matters: one is Spain, and the other is China. The governments of both countries have now submitted applications to the League of Nations. The Soviet representative firmly believes that the League of Nations can provide strong assistance to Spain and China. Why can't the League of Nations do this now? It is because we are deeply afraid of arousing the dissatisfaction of agitators and because we are deeply afraid of being scolded by unruly newspapers. Then what will the League of Nations do? Some people therefore believe that the best way to avoid aggression is to concede to the aggressor. If so, then they must remember that after Japan conquered Manchuria, it was followed by Italy's invasion of Abyssinia. The League of Nations' failure to fully prevent the Abyssinian incident led to the occurrence of the Spanish incident, and the League of Nations' inability to do anything about the Spanish incident is the origin of Japan's invasion of China. For this reason, we advocate using the method of collective resistance to deal with aggressor nations. Only then can we realize the ideal of a universal international organization and make the League of Nations a true instrument of peace. There is only one way to make aggressor nations wary and have to return to the League of Nations." (Central News Agency, 21st, Havas)

### League of Nations Discusses Sino-Japanese Issue, United States Decides to Participate

Appoints Minister to Switzerland to Attend Meeting; Prepared to Consider Resolutions of the League of Nations

[Geneva] The Twenty-Three Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet at 5 PM today to consider the Chinese application. This meeting is purely formal. Beyond further discussion, it is unlikely that any other action will be taken. Foreign Minister Spaak of Belgium is expected to be elected chairman. The committee must first invite representatives from the Chinese and Japanese governments to attend. This may be delayed somewhat. Germany was originally a member of the advisory committee, but now that Germany is no longer a member of the League of Nations, the question of whether Germany should be invited to attend should also be considered. Therefore, the committee will not be able to begin work immediately. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)

[Washington] Regarding the participation of the United States Minister to Switzerland, Harrison, in the Sino-Japanese issue advisory committee in the capacity of observer from that country, the United States government recently issued a press release stating that Minister Harrison has sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, stating: "I am ordered by the government of this country to participate in the advisory committee, and the authority I enjoy is the same as that enjoyed by the former Minister of this country to Switzerland, Wilson, when he first participated in March 1933, and my intentions are also the same. Regarding this, Mr. Wilson has already explained in detail in a note sent to the former Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, on March 13 of that year. The advisory committee was originally established in accordance with the proposal submitted by the then Executive Yuan to the temporary assembly of the League of Nations. In the view of the United States government, its common intention lies in promoting cooperation between member states and non-member states of the League of Nations, so as to implement the resolutions passed by the League of Nations in a unified action and with the same attitude. However, it is difficult to say at this time to what extent the United States government can actually participate before it knows exactly what work the committee is undertaking. In order to avoid misunderstandings, hesitations, ambiguities, and delays, it must be declared in advance that the United States may not be able to assume the responsibilities borne by the member states of the League of Nations. However, the United States deeply believes in the principle of mutual cooperation among countries to resolve international disputes by peaceful means, and therefore is prepared to give great attention to the recommendations that the League of Nations may decide upon. It is not appropriate to state in advance what position the United States government should take." (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas)

### Japanese Navy Inspects Merchant Ships, France Does Not Recognize

Japan Accepts Two British Conditions

[Paris] Regarding the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coast, the French government has recently decided on the following measures: ⑴ In order to avoid disputes, French merchant ships sailing to the Chinese coast should notify the commander of the French Far East Fleet of the ship's name and the names of the shipowner and charterer. ⑵ The commander of the French Far East Fleet should then notify the Japanese naval authorities of the names of the ship's name and the names of the shipowner and charterer. However, France does not recognize the Japanese navy's right to interfere with the free passage of French merchant ships to the Chinese coast. Even if no notification has been given, the Japanese navy cannot interfere. (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas)

[Tokyo] The Japanese government has agreed to the conditions set by Britain that would allow Japanese warships to stop British ships off the coast of China in order to inspect their registration certificates. According to reliable sources, Britain has stated that it considers the entire procedure to be illegal, but under the following conditions, it does not intend to quibble over legal rights: ⑴ If there is a British warship within one mile, the Japanese warship must first obtain its permission before inspecting the nationality of a British merchant ship. ⑵ If there is no British warship within one mile, the Japanese warship must immediately report the inspection, and the inspection must be limited to checking the registration certificate. The British government also reserves the right to demand compensation for any losses or damages incurred as a result of the Japanese action. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)

### Chiang Kai-shek's Interview with French Reporter

If Japan's Aggression Does Not Stop, Our Resistance Will Not Stop; Hope the League of Nations Can Take Effective Sanctions

[Paris] The Paris Evening News published an interview with Chiang Kai-shek, stating in summary: The current Sino-Japanese war is the result of Japan's deliberate aggression against China. In order to eliminate aggression and for self-preservation and survival, China has no choice but to resist with all its might. The purpose of the large-scale invasion by the Japanese army is nothing more than to eliminate the entire Chinese nation's survival. Our response should also be aimed at the survival of the entire nation. Shanghai and North China are both Chinese territories and must be viewed as a whole issue. If Japan's armed aggression within Chinese territory does not stop for a day, then China's war of resistance against Japan will not stop for a day. Even if we have only one gun and one bullet left, we must persist in fighting until Japan fundamentally abandons its policy of aggression and withdraws its military forces, which are instruments of aggression. In order to safeguard world peace, human civilization, the dignity of treaties, and the effectiveness of international law, I earnestly hope that the League of Nations will this time earnestly fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Charter and take effective sanctions against Japan. Japan's atrocities in the six years since 1921 clearly demonstrate Japan's ambition to conquer China and become the leader of East Asia. If the powers still do not take timely measures to curb Japan's aggression, then not only will each country's original trade with China be wiped out, but each country's territory in East Asia will also be seriously threatened. Therefore, sanctions against Japan are not only to help China alone, but also to protect the interests of the member states of the League of Nations and relevant non-member states themselves. I firmly believe that statesmen with a broad vision in various countries will see this and comply with the Charter to sanction Japan in order to fulfill their obligations.

### Hull Speaks Again on American Policy: Neither Leaning Towards Isolation Nor Being Meddlesome

Willing to Discuss Disarmament and Lowering Tariffs; Hopes Other Countries Respect Life and Property

[New York] Secretary of State Hull spoke at the American Banqueting Hall today on American policy, stating that the policy adopted by the United States today is one that neither leans towards isolation nor readily becomes entangled in foreign disputes. When discussing the issue of the National Socialist movement, Hull believed that if Americans growing up abroad place the interests of other countries above the interests of the United States and accept the command of foreign governments and political parties, then we will never be able to tolerate them. Hull then reiterated that the United States is willing to re-discuss disarmament, reducing trade barriers, stabilizing world currencies, and other issues with other countries. He also stated, "Although we do not want to interfere in others' disputes today, we have never given up on demanding that other countries respect the rights and lives of our people." Finally, Army Chief of Staff Woodring urged American soldiers to sincerely support President Roosevelt and Hull in order to ensure that the United States adheres to a strict policy of neutrality. (21st, National Telegraph)

⊙Boston Secretary of State Hull spoke at a raw materials allocation conference today, asking the world to facilitate the flow of raw materials so that international trade is no longer subject to undue obstruction. The current situation is so serious that the cloud of war has darkened the world. Therefore, the most important thing for people in the world today is to broaden their minds, expand their vision, refrain from indulging in emotions, have no selfishness, remove old grudges, and trust and cooperate with each other. Only then can we succeed. (20th, National Telegraph)

●Boston Secretary of State Hull spoke at a raw materials allocation conference at the National Peace Conference here today, stating that "the shadow of war has darkened the entire world. What the world urgently needs now is faith in promises and the rule of law, and not unreasonable force." Hull further stated that the United States' reciprocal trade agreement plan is a fundamental alternative to the war-breeding politics of economic nationalism and economic isolationism. International trade, as a complement to domestic commerce, is the only way to raise the standard of living throughout the world to a degree that makes the propaganda of cyclical imperialist aggression ineffective. Hull predicted that the unemployment of workers in European armaments factories in the future will become a serious issue and indicated that Europe's surplus should be shipped abroad to exchange for the goods it needs. Therefore, he deeply felt that international trade agreements are the best remedy. (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters)

●Boston The National Peace Conference discussed the issue of raw materials allocation today and held a banquet at noon. Secretary of State Hull spoke at the banquet, criticizing the economic nationalism of "forcing people to tighten their belts and reduce their expenses" and advocating the abolition of tariff barriers and the restoration of the normal mode of international trade. Countries that pursue a policy of self-sufficiency in economics will "inevitably lower the living standards of their people." In the United States, we should continue to establish commercial agreements with various countries based on the principle of reciprocity, and he said that there can be no lasting peace until the general standard of living in the world is raised to an appropriate level.

### Japan Purchases Three Ships from the United States

United States Side Still Claims to Be Unaware

⊙New Orleans According to the 78 Japanese sailors who arrived here today, the Japanese Association in Shanghai has purchased three American ships, but the Japanese consul firmly claims to be unaware of the matter. According to officials at the John Shipyard, the matter was handled by Mr. Marton of New York, who sold the ships to a Japanese man posing as a Chinese man named Ye, for a price of $184,050. (20th, National Telegraph)

[Washington] According to the Maritime Commission, it has not heard of the matter of the Japanese purchasing three American ships in secret. The spokesman also said that Mr. Marton of New York said after taking pictures of the ships that they were for the Chinese, and later changed it to say that they were for the British. In short, the Maritime Commission has no right to ask who the ships are ultimately for. (20th, National Telegraph)

### Britain and the United States Discuss International Monetary Issues

Rumors of Silver Price Increase; Said to Benefit China

[Washington] British and American financial authorities met with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for the first time today to discuss international monetary issues. Although none of the participants would reveal the purpose of the meeting, the scope of the discussion was probably to seek a new understanding of monetary issues related to the two countries. Those attending the meeting included British Undersecretary of the Treasury Phillips, British Embassy Counselor to the United States Mallet, and Financial Counselor Thornton, American Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Taylor, and Second Secretary of the American Embassy in Britain Birdwhistell. Silver faction senators today believed that the meeting between Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and British Undersecretary of the Treasury Phillips would consider the London Silver Agreement, which expires in mid-December, and the issue of world silver prices. The issue is quite important to China. After meeting with Treasury officials, one senator said that in his personal expectation, the world price of silver is likely to rise due to domestic and foreign political relations. The Treasury Department may cancel the difference between domestic and foreign silver prices, thereby increasing foreign silver prices. This matter is quite beneficial to China, but to be successful, British cooperation is necessary to prevent India from taking the opportunity to sell in large quantities. As Japan used the opportunity of the United States' purchase of silver two years ago to smuggle huge amounts of silver out of China privately, the United States had to limit its purchases to prevent China from suffering great losses. However, if we were to purchase in large quantities again now, it would be beneficial to China. (20th, National Telegraph)

### Britain and France Discuss Exchange Rate Issues

French Finance Minister Broadcasts Speech

[London] French Ambassador to Britain Corbin visited Prime Minister Chamberlain at the Prime Minister's residence this afternoon, ending the conversation after half an hour. According to responsible British sources, the two discussed foreign exchange issues. Regarding this matter, the British and French authorities have agreed to maintain contact in order to protect their respective currencies from being hit by unfair speculation. The exchange rate of the franc against the pound has recently fallen to 147 francs. This drastic change was not economically stipulated by the tripartite currency agreement between Britain, the United States, and France. Although the British responsible parties expressed concern, the British Treasury Department did not protest to the French government. (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas)

[Paris] Finance Minister Bonnet delivered a radio broadcast speech this evening, discussing the current sharp drop in the franc's exchange rate and France's financial situation, stating in summary: "The governments of Britain, the United States, and France signed a currency agreement last September to stabilize their respective currencies through cooperation. The French government is now determined to maintain this policy and must avoid adopting any measures that would isolate the French currency. The government has made many efforts to reorganize public finances in the past, but these efforts are still insufficient. Economic recovery is essential to achieve this. The recent fluctuations in the franc's exchange rate show that the reorganization of public finances has not been fully successful. The monetary system is a reflection of a country's entire activities, and the monetary system can only remain stable by increasing production. Any measures that use the gold reserves of the Bank of France or use exchange controls to maintain an artificial parity of the franc cannot fundamentally solve the problem."

### Yan Huiqing's Telegram Delivered to the League of Nations

Distributed to all member states

[Geneva] The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations recently forwarded to the delegations of all member states a telegram from Dr. Yan Huiqing, president of the Chinese Society of International Studies, sent from Shanghai.

It also stated that China has always been peace-loving. Even after Japan's invasion of China's three northeastern provinces in 1931, China's desire to live in peace with its neighboring countries has not wavered.

Now, China's survival has been severely threatened. "The Chinese government and people, in order to defend their territorial integrity and political independence, have no other way to go but to rise up and resist the insults at the cost of great sacrifices.

Current Commentary

### Review of Wartime Propaganda Work

— Ming

Modern wars between countries are essentially the sum of the mobilization of all institutions in the warring nations. Peacetime preparation work—national defense—whether military, economic, social, or cultural, reveals its strengths and weaknesses one by one during wartime. This is what is meant by total war. This is common sense. However, there are also weak countries that are forced to cope with war when the situation does not allow them to prepare adequately. The current struggle to resist the Japanese invasion is a clear example. This time we are responding to war, not seeking war. The disorganization and weakness of all institutions are undeniable. But we must regret and be vigilant. For example, we govern the country through the party, and the organization cannot be said to be incomplete. The government cannot be said to be making insufficient efforts to promote the Baojia system. However, since the outbreak of the war of resistance, traitors have been active, which is hateful. Also, propaganda has a dedicated department, and news has censorship, which can be called perfection. How can the enemy's intelligence about our national conditions be so detailed? The degree of detail is far beyond what our people can fully understand. These kinds of facts seem to go beyond the scope of seeking understanding. We should be sincere from top to bottom and reflect deeply. Now the whole country is working together to overcome national difficulties, and there is no time to blame each other. But anything that is closely related to the pain of war should be told frankly in the hope of finding a solution. Now I would like to elaborate on the propaganda work of cultural institutions.

In this war of resistance, the active work of cultural institutions was not only very minimal, but also felt too weak. The domestic education and publishing sectors have almost completely stalled. Overseas activities have still failed to avoid temporary patchwork. Looking at the negative aspects, there is a lack of organization and dispatch. Furthermore, actions lacking common sense have not been sanctioned. Let me give one example. A few days ago, a certain newspaper used real-time photography to transmit front-line intelligence as a gimmick. Unintentionally, it provided the enemy with information, placing our front-line soldiers in a desperate situation, almost completely reversing a cleverly planned layout. It was just because of a muddle-headed paper and a photo. A battlefield, a trench, and a cannon are not uncommon. However, if the background is highlighted and the shadows are rendered, then the enemy can calculate the position and detect the collection. Coupled with modern three-dimensional tactics, it is not difficult to destroy it immediately. Looking at how strictly the Japanese in Hongkou, Shanghai, prohibit anyone from peeking at the placement of their artillery positions, it is so meticulous and prudent. Recently, I saw a Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 17th, saying that Mr. Mengen and other photographers from an American news film company have finished filming in Beijing and will rush to the rear of the Chinese front line to shoot the actual battlefield situation. I can't help but feel endless worry. However, I have not yet seen cultural institutions pay any attention or comment on it. Is it true that they cannot see this?

Our front-line soldiers are defending the country and destroying the enemy. The heroic and moving postures of all kinds, and the various situations of the authorities equipping the battlefield and deploying military forces, are what the people in the rear and sympathetic people in friendly countries are eager to know and see. The more details, the more welcome. A kind of enthusiastic emotion is also appropriate. Reporters and filmmakers work hard to search for and strive to satisfy this desire. There is nothing wrong with that. But one should know that the fighting party's desire to know the other party's situation and deployment, their frantic efforts, surpass our emotions of pure admiration and appreciation. Therefore, a detailed war diary or a photo of a brave attack, when we read it, we only feel admiration and sigh.

If the enemy gets it, it will have the wonderful effect of following the map. Unintentionally, it will ruin the soldiers on our front line. Under the pen and in front of the camera, should reporters and filmmakers not be careful? Should cultural institutions not pay urgent attention?

Our military and political authorities have recently established restrictive measures for comforting the front lines. I hope that regulations will be established for the promotion of war situations, whether in text or film, and strictly enforced. Preventing arbitrary actions beforehand is much better than reviewing them afterwards. Although this is a passive role of cultural institutions, it may not be the source of active effectiveness. Therefore, I would like to bring it up for discussion, hoping that the cultural community will make more efforts.

### US Accepts Japan's Unreasonable Demands, Anti-Japanese Association Expresses Attitude

Friendship and Justice are Deceptive Words; Self-Reliance is the Highest Truth

Hasegawa, commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, sent a note to the consulates of various countries in Shanghai on the 19th, stating that he would bomb the capital of China and requested that the personnel of the embassies, residents, and warships of various countries in Beijing move to a safe zone. The attitudes of various countries were very indifferent to this. Only the US Embassy accepted the Japanese request and moved to a warship to work. The reporter visited a certain gentleman of the presidium of the Anti-Japanese Support Association in this city about this matter. According to him, since the war of resistance, Japanese bandits have indiscriminately bombed everywhere, and countless innocent people have been killed. Bombing the capital is not the first time. Each time, planes crash and people die, and they are defeated and retreat. Recently, because the war in Shanghai has been protracted and they have been unable to exert themselves, they have made this threatening remark in an attempt to confuse the people in the rear and also to test the attitudes of various countries. In fact, the will of our country to resist Japan is extremely firm, and it will not end until the final victory is obtained. The enemy's move just shows that their tricks are exhausted. Fortunately, the people of various countries have expressed their sympathy for us, and the diplomats of various countries have also deeply understood the righteousness. They have rejected the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side. Only the US Embassy decided to do so, which is beyond our expectation. In history, the United States has always been able to uphold justice and advocate fairness whenever Japan invades China. Therefore, the spirit of love and affection between the people of the two countries is unusually close. Moreover, the United States has always advocated peace, and in international disputes, it often respects treaties. When the Japanese invaded Northeast China, the United States also participated in the International Advisory Committee and jointly determined that Japan was an aggressor country. Now, the aggressor country is bombing the capital of China with air force, but the United States accepts its warning in reverse. Where is the intention of the dignified ambassador to avoid boarding a warship? It is incomprehensible. Moreover, the United States is the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's invasion of China has destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty. For the sake of increasing the friendship between the two countries, or for the sake of maintaining the dignity of international peace treaties, the United States should assist China and impose sanctions on the violent Japan. However, the United States' prevention of arms exports is no different from secretly assisting Japan, giving China difficulties, and succumbing to Japan's unreasonable intimidation, regardless of the dignity of the envoy. It is a bad precedent in the international community. It is not surprising that Japan is destroying the treaty. The United States is a country that respects treaty obligations. Now, it does not distinguish between right and wrong. It turns a blind eye to Japan's trampling on China's territory and sovereignty, which is really strange. What is the so-called treaty obligation? No wonder the Chinese people are extremely indignant. We are severely stimulated by this and feel that friendship is a false word and justice is a deceptive word. Only by looking at the enemy, making a painful decision, seeking self-reliance for survival, and seeking liberation through self-determination, is the unbreakable truth. In the current anti-Japanese work, we must redouble our efforts and strive for the final victory. As for this improper measure by the United States, I think the American people may not be able to sympathize with it. If the US government does not want to lose this old friend of China for many years, it will be able to correct it automatically.

Is it appropriate? Please discuss the case. It was resolved to pass it and notify the local unions by the name of the Building Fund Management Committee. ㊂ Committee member Zhang Kechang proposed that, at this time of the country's comprehensive war of resistance, it is proposed to telegraph the transportation workers across the country to concentrate their efforts, unite and unite, and resist the enemy for a long time, so as to serve as a backing for the government.

Order the local unions to follow the union's 24th notice and handle it immediately. 2. The union will purchase various condolences and send personnel to various wounded soldiers' hospitals to express condolences and pay tribute. ㊄ The Training Department proposed to send a letter to the Directorate General of Posts, requesting the establishment of battlefield post offices in various war zones to emphasize military mail and facilitate transportation. It was resolved to send a letter to the Directorate General of Posts to handle it. ㊅ The General Affairs Department proposed to order the local unions to instruct their members to be faithful to their duties, work hard, and implement savings to store national strength. Is it feasible? Please discuss the case. It was resolved to pass it. ㊆ The Propaganda Department proposed to temporarily suspend publication of the 'Chinese Postal Worker' and change to issuing union reports. Is it appropriate?

### Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee Purchases Autumn Cocoons in Zhejiang Province

Affected by the current situation, manufacturers' purchasing power decreases; Use bank autumn cocoon loans to purchase yourself

This year's autumn cocoons in Zhejiang, Yuhang, Haining and other places have begun to be launched. Due to the climate, the harvest is good. The Zhejiang Silk Control Committee recruits merchants to purchase autumn cocoons in the territory. In addition to the Zhejiang silk manufacturers purchasing as usual, the silk manufacturers and surplus cocoon merchants in Shanghai are unable to purchase. Moreover, the purchase amount of Zhejiang manufacturers has been greatly reduced due to the current situation, and it is bound to cause a surplus of cocoon production, which will have a significant impact on the livelihood of farmers. In view of this, the committee plans to use the 8.5 million yuan autumn cocoon loan from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Central Bank to organize the 1937 Autumn Cocoon Purchase Committee for self-purchase. The purchased cocoons will be entrusted to various silk factories in Zhejiang Province for reeling, and the reeled silk will be sold directly to foreign countries. The sales matters will be handled by the raw silk sales committee under the committee.

### British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to be Discharged from Hospital This Week

Scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 7th of next month; Transfer to East India for recuperation

### City Relief Committee's Work on Refugee Relief (Continued)

Enemy Aircraft Rampage

Due to the enemy's inhumanity, they constantly bomb and strafe refugee transportation vehicles and ships, resulting in the deaths of thousands of refugees. According to the committee's report, on August 12th, seven cars leaving Shanghai for Suzhou were bombed by enemy aircraft at Nanxiang, resulting in the death and injury of fifty to sixty refugees. On August 28th, refugees gathered at the South Railway Station, preparing to board the train, when they were bombed by enemy aircraft, resulting in over four hundred casualties. On September 5th, at Yejidun, Beixinjing, a small steamer towing barges transporting refugees to Suzhou and Jiaxing was strafed by enemy aircraft, resulting in sixty to seventy casualties. On September 13th, at the same location, refugees being sent away by small steamers and civilian boats were again bombed by enemy aircraft, resulting in over four hundred casualties. Furthermore, the casualties from bombing and strafing by enemy aircraft among refugees who left Shanghai on their own or were not registered with the committee have not been included in the count. The enemy's cruelty is clearly evident in these events.

Difficulties with Provisions

Providing provisions for so many refugees is a heavy and burdensome task. The committee is responsible for the distribution and supply of all kinds of provisions for the refugees, the collection, storage, and preservation of food and clothing, and all temporary preparations for refugee provisions. Each refugee requires about five "he" of rice per day. Some shelters provide two meals a day, while others provide one meal and two bowls of porridge, or one bowl of porridge and one meal. Most shelters have refugees taking turns cooking for themselves. All rice and grain are purchased by the committee from the People's Food Adjustment Committee. Recently, the total amount of rice needed daily is about one hundred "dan".

Attention to Illnesses

The committee pays great attention to the refugees' health problems, and has therefore established a medical group to specifically handle these matters. The committee's staff stationed in the shelters constantly monitor the health of the refugees. If illnesses are discovered, minor cases are treated by volunteer doctors, while serious cases are sent to refugee hospitals for treatment. At the same time, the sanitation of the refugees is regularly inspected to prevent the spread of disease. The health departments of the two concessions have also specially dispatched doctors to the shelters to vaccinate the refugees and administer preventative injections. For those who die from illness, the burial team arranges for coffins and burials. With the refugees constantly subjected to enemy bombing, the number of casualties is especially high, making burials even more complicated.

Guidance and Instruction

Refugees living together in one place, idling all day, feel restless and uneasy. The committee is making use of this time to conduct guidance and instruction activities, with the following general outline: (A) Objectives of Guidance: (1) Wartime knowledge; (2) Ensuring collective adherence to order; (3) Making clear the necessity of resettlement and safer areas; (4) Arousing each individual's abilities; (5) Providing life guidance; (6) Ensuring they are not used by the enemy. (B) Staff Allocation: (1) Those with knowledge, skills, and a spirit of service should be the backbone; (2) Professionals from all walks of life; (3) Their native place should be which province or city (emphasis on dialect); (4) They must be trustworthy individuals. (C) Teaching Equipment: (1) One radio per shelter; (2) One display board; (3) Other items. (D) Methods of Guidance: (1) Broadcasting to refugees via radio; (2) Using text and images on display boards; (3) Constant patrolling, providing verbal guidance to people at any time. (E) Other Points to Note: (1) Staff should be enthusiastic and sincere in their attitude; (2) Pay attention to the refugees' actions to prevent spies. The guidance team dispatches personnel to the shelters to be responsible for guidance, according to this outline.

Results Achieved

The committee's work has been effective. All staff are seconded from various agencies and organizations, so they are all working on a voluntary basis. Internal personnel management seems to be more difficult, but it does not hinder the overall progress of the work. Furthermore, most staff members are able to work diligently and according to established procedures. The committee's funding comes from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Anti-Enemy Support Association, and other charitable organizations, as well as direct donations from individuals.

### The Merger of Three Banks in Sichuan and Kangding into the Sichuan-Kangding People's Bank

A branch will be established in Shanghai, with Zhang Shulin as the manager. All previous claims and debts of the three banks' headquarters and branches will be fully transferred to the new bank from today. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch yesterday: (1) The Sichuan-Kangding Development Bank opened in September of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], with a total capital of four million yuan, of which 1.5 million yuan was paid up. It was initiated by Lu Zuofu, Liu Hangshu, and others. (2) The Chongqing People's Bank opened in October of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It was initiated by Liu Hangshu, Zhang Zili, and others. (3) The Sichuan Commercial Bank opened in October of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], with a capital of one million yuan. It was initiated by Liu Hanchen, Tang Digong, and others.

### The Proposal to Use Rent to Purchase Government Bonds is Still Under Deliberation

The Special Nature of the Special Zone Requires Detailed Measures

The Nanshi, Zhabei, and First and Second Special Zones of this city, for the government's current issuance of national salvation bonds, have citizens organizing to handle the matter. It was previously proposed to collect one month's rent to purchase government bonds. Upon hearing this, some tenants have refused to pay rent. Yesterday, the reporter inquired about this matter with the person in charge of the team, who said that the team does have this plan, but it is still under deliberation. How it will be implemented in the future will be decided after consultation with the National Salvation Bond Promotion Association. Furthermore, the nature of the First and Second Special Zones is special, so detailed measures must be drafted when implementing this plan. Many landlords, who are deeply aware of the greater good and have a history of patriotism, have voluntarily offered one month's rent to subscribe to government bonds. This kind of enthusiasm is truly admirable.

### Japan's Economic and Financial Situation Has Entered a Path of Collapse

Farmers Affected by Conscription, Unable to Work; Financial Circles Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards Underwriting Government Bonds

According to a Western financier who recently arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo, the Japanese government has repeatedly forced conscription in the country due to its defeats in the Shanghai battle. Most of the conscripts are farmers and small businesspeople. These people only know about going to war but do not know the purpose of going to war. They are extremely resentful of the total sacrifice of their personal lives and careers. Those who make excuses and refuse to be conscripted are shot by the authorities. Relatives are not allowed to see them off when they leave to reduce stimulation. If family members express resentment, subsidies are stopped as a punishment. Therefore, anti-war voices from the people are increasing day by day, and there is a growing trend that force cannot maintain. Many anti-war printed materials have been confiscated by military police. Public opinion is also controlled and is no longer sufficient to represent the will of the people. The police department is intensifying war prevention because the left wing is taking advantage of the opportunity to engage in activities. Japanese farmers are no longer able to engage in rural labor due to the influence of conscription. Although the impact on industry and commerce is not yet apparent due to the beginning of the war, prices will inevitably increase in the future, which is extremely important to the people's livelihood. In the financial sector, opposition has been expressed to capital adjustment plans, and a wait-and-see attitude has been adopted towards underwriting government bonds. Capitalists also once expressed anti-war sentiment. Although they are temporarily silent now, the psychology of fearing the war situation is truly bottomless. If the war continues to be lost in the future, Japan's economy and finances will inevitably be completely shaken and eventually move towards a path of collapse.

### An Appeal to Citizens to Purchase Government Bonds by the Second Special Zone Fundraising Team

The Crisis is Deep and the Disaster is Urgent, Do Not Hesitate, Do Not Delay, Hoping Everyone Will Subscribe to Increase the Strength of Resistance

The Second Special Zone Encouragement and Relief Team released an appeal to all the citizens of the city yesterday, saying, "All citizens of the Second Special Zone, the ferocious Japanese imperialists have not only seized our Northeastern provinces, but have also invaded our central land. They have sent troops and brutalized the area from Songjiang, making it unbearable and intolerable for us. We have no choice but to temporarily resort to holy war to defend our country. Therefore, this war is truly at the final juncture of life and death for the Chinese nation. We must deeply understand that only with a country can there be a home, and only with a home can there be a life. If the country is lost, our lives and property cannot be preserved. Therefore, if we want to survive, we must contribute all our resources, labor, and capital to the country, especially by actively promoting the purchase of national salvation bonds recently issued by the government to increase our strength to resist the enemy. The total amount of national salvation bonds is 500 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 4%, and principal will begin to be repaid from the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. Buying government bonds is no different than depositing a long-term deposit in the bank. You can still get interest, you can still withdraw the principal, and you can also express your enthusiasm for saving the country. What could be better? On the other hand, if the country is lost and the family is broken, what is the use of having millions of family assets? Therefore, in addition to actively purchasing national salvation bonds with cash, we should also use gold and silver jewelry to purchase them. To be honest, under such a serious national crisis, these jewelry are really useless. It is better to simply exchange them for government bonds, which can generate interest and save the country. It is truly a win-win situation. Citizens, the crisis is deep, and the disaster is urgent. Let's not hesitate any longer. Get up immediately and actively purchase national salvation bonds to strengthen the strength of resistance and seek our independent survival."

### The Benevolent Society Broadcasts and Solicits Donations for Refugee Relief

The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's Committee for Refugee Relief in War Zones will hold a broadcast to solicit donations for refugee relief from yesterday (the 21st) to the 23rd, from 1:00 PM to 8:00 PM at the Fordon Radio Station on Hart Road, and will be broadcast by various radio stations in Shanghai. The program includes Peking opera by Dr. Mei Lanfang and the Zhengyi Society Fanwangdu Club, as well as songs, dramas, and music by Shanghai movie stars.

### Chen Qiming, an Eleven-Year-Old Child, Donates Money for Relief

The Righteousness Accounts Association is Collecting Old Clothes

Chen Qiming, an eleven-year-old child, saddened by the plight of the refugees, specifically requested his parents to send his four yuan birthday expenses to the Chinese and Foreign Righteousness Accounts Disaster Relief Association for relief purposes. Furthermore, the association is currently collecting old clothing and bedding for refugees to keep warm. The Shanghai Sanrui Hall Fashion Industry Association donated 824 items, the Shifushanzhuang 114 items, and various households in its area donated over 1,000 items, which have been transferred to refugee shelters for distribution.

### A Letter to Compatriots from the Youth Anti-Enemy National Salvation Corps

A Plea to Patrons of Movie Theaters and Dance Halls

The Chinese Youth Anti-Enemy National Salvation Corps, for the sake of sustained resistance, respectfully addresses this letter to compatriots, and also includes a warning to movie theater and dance hall owners: "From the loss of the four northeastern provinces to the present, we have lived through six years of shame and tears. In these six years, we have been constantly caressing these obvious scars and constantly looking forward to the day of revenge. After six years of tribulation and struggle, now, this great day—national resistance—has finally arrived. The hatred of half a century and the blood debts of six years are about to be avenged and settled.

The outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai battle is the prelude to our Chinese nation's struggle for liberation, and it is also the critical moment for the survival of our Chinese nation. To achieve this liberation and survival, we must realize the unity of the government and the people and launch a sustained and comprehensive war of resistance. To ensure the final victory of the war of resistance, the key depends on the strength of the people. In other words, the strength of the people can determine the final victory or failure of the war of resistance.

Since the launch of the war of resistance, the heroic soldiers have always been sacrificing heroically with their flesh and blood against the enemy's artillery fire. What has been the performance of the people? To be honest, it is like scattered sand, without organization or strength. Although some patriotic people are working hard on disaster relief, assistance, fundraising, consolation, participation in the war, etc., this is ultimately a very small force, and it cannot be integrated with the military. This cannot be said to be a very concerning phenomenon.

In addition, there is one more heartbreaking thing: not only are the people unorganized, but there are even some unscrupulous and profit-seeking merchants who are doing "backward" things. We must not ignore this. For example, after the expansion of the war zone, several movie theaters and dance halls in the special zone have reopened under artillery fire. The movie theaters show love films of brothers and sisters, and the dance halls dance with pink and green thighs. May we ask, has the time for "singing and dancing peace" arrived? It is certainly unforgivable for unscrupulous merchants to not love the country and even engage in anesthetizing the people, but the guilt of the people who seek pleasure is no less than theirs.

Everyone, we should recognize the significance and nature of this war of resistance. The supreme leader of the government has said, "Regardless of north or south, regardless of old or young," "Those who have money should contribute money, and those who have strength should contribute strength." Since we are unable to contribute money, we should contribute strength. Everyone should use their own abilities and, under the leadership of the government, work hard on national salvation from their own position. In this way, at least the effect of "organized people in the rear" can be achieved, and the government, without worries in the rear, can concentrate on fighting the enemy with all its heart. If we persist for three or five years, not only will there be no difficulty, but it can ensure the final victory.

At that time, our Chinese nation will be liberated. At that time, we can enjoy legitimate human happiness to our heart's content. Why bother seeking happiness in today's war-torn world?

Here, we may as well make a suggestion to the owners of movie theaters: quickly change your approach and show a few meaningful films that inspire national thought. This will not only prevent you from being scorned by the people, but will also have the good reputation of "educating the people." Is this not killing two birds with one stone? Otherwise, convert the existing theater into a shelter or a hospital for the wounded (there are already many precedents in Shanghai).

As for dance halls, the only thing to do is convert them into shelters or hospitals for the wounded. We dare to ask the dance hall owners to repent and show their patriotic sincerity. Finally, we have to issue a warning: if there are still those who are obsessed and continue to engage in anesthetizing the people, they are traitors to the nation and our common enemy."

### Cotton Vests

The Number is Still Far From Enough, Hoping All Sectors Will Speed Up the Delivery

The weather is getting colder, and the soldiers on the front lines are fighting hard against the enemy in wind, frost, rain, and dew. The Shanghai Consolation Committee has launched a campaign to solicit donations for "soldier's cotton vests" to protect the health of the loyal and brave soldiers defending the country. In the past few days, thanks to the enthusiastic donations from compatriots in all sectors, the results have been very impressive, but the number is still far from the target of one million pieces. The style of the vests is shown below. It is hoped that enthusiastic women will donate as much as possible so that the target number can be reached in the shortest possible time, thereby enhancing the anti-war strength of the soldiers on the front lines.

Completed Vests Should be Sent to Collection Agencies Soon

According to reports, there is an urgent need for cotton vests on the front lines, which cannot be delayed. Donors can send the completed vests to the Local Association of the China United Building, the Jinli Cotton Cloth Association, the Jingtu Nunnery on Guling Road, the Dahua Dance Hall on Edinburgh Road, or the Consolation Committee of the Ningbo Fellow Association and the City Chamber of Commerce on Yu Qiaqing Road. So that they can be transferred immediately. From now on, send as many pieces as you make each day. If you wait until you have made a whole batch to send out, it will be delayed.

### Order Restored in the Area Under the Jurisdiction of the Hui Si Police Station

Curfew Advanced to Maintain Security, Shops Have Resumed Normal Business

After the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the defense of the area north of the Suzhou River under the jurisdiction of the Hui Si Police Station was originally carried out by the International Settlement Volunteers, who piled up defenses on the border of the Chinese area. Later, British regular army soldiers replaced them. Although some residents of the area moved out, most of them remained, and the order was very good. However, in the past few days, various rumors have suddenly arisen, and the police station has advanced the curfew time in the area, starting at 6:00 PM until 6:00 AM the next morning, causing panic among some residents who did not understand the truth. According to the reporter's investigation, there are two reasons why the police station advanced the implementation of the curfew north of the Suzhou River: (1) to prevent residents from being in danger of being hit by stray bullets while staying in the roads at night; (2) after dark, thieves take the opportunity to commit crimes, and theft cases occur daily. Therefore, advancing the curfew prevents thieves from acting. Therefore, since the implementation of this ban, the number of people hit by stray bullets in the Hui Si Police Station area has been reduced day by day, and the number of theft cases has also been reduced a lot compared to before. The rumors have been dispelled. This morning, I went to inspect and saw that the shops in the area have resumed normal business, and many residents have returned. The vegetable market on Aierjin Road has been temporarily closed, but the vegetable market on North Fujian Road is still open as usual. A section of Kaifeng Road is set up by rural women, selling a large number of vegetables, and the prices are not expensive. The defenses in the area are also extremely strong. Therefore, the situation in the area is actually much better than it was two weeks ago.

### Hengli Bank Officially Begins Liquidation Yesterday

### The Relief Committee Sends Over Nine Hundred Refugees

Various Fellow Associations Continue to Send Refugees

On the 20th of this month, the Refugee Sending Team of the City Relief Committee sent 590 refugees on behalf of various fellow associations and 330 refugees from the committee's shelters, totaling 920 people. They were transported to Suzhou at 3:00 PM on more than a dozen tugboats of the Yongchang Shipping Company.

The Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai, in order to handle the matter of poor fellow villagers returning to their ancestral homes in Guangdong, has been registering at the Guangzhao Guild Hall in the Shanghai Bank Building on Jiangxi Road since the 12th of this month. It has been ten days, and more than 7,000 people have registered so far, mostly women, children, the elderly, and the weak. Adult fellow villagers are waiting to be processed in the future. Furthermore, the association will decide on ships tonight. Please pay attention to the advertisements in the Shen and Xin newspapers.

The Jiangyin-Wuxi Joint Relief Association has been working hard on shelter and repatriation since August 13th. It has sent more than 26,000 refugees back to their homes before and after. Yesterday (the 21st), the 16th batch still hired Shenlong Shipping and towed nine civilian ships, transporting 1,500 refugees back to their homes.

The Wuxi Fellow Association Wartime Service Corps' Repatriation Team chartered a ship from the Xiexing Shipping Company today to transport a thousand people back to their homes. The Shelter Team now has fewer fellow villagers in Shanghai and wishes to establish five shelters. Three places have temporarily suspended shelter. There are still more than 3,000 refugees in the two places, Zhejiang Road and Stealing Chicken Bridge, and will continue to be sent away.

### The Relief Committee Seeks to Relieve Refugees in the Tai-Jia-Bao Area

Those Who Have Not Been Sheltered Can Go to the Committee Themselves, and It is Hoped That People From All Walks of Life Will Guide Them Along the Way

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the refugees in the Tai-Jia-Bao area have suffered the most from the war. It is difficult for the City Relief Committee to find ways to send a whole batch of rescued refugees to Shanghai for shelter. However, most of the refugees in these areas fled from the war zone in a hurry, leaving behind their families. Therefore, there are often small groups of two or three people wandering around Shanghai, even wandering the streets for days without a full meal. The situation is very pitiful. Now, in order to find ways to take care of them, the City Relief Committee is not only providing relief at any time, but also intends to record it in the newspaper to announce to these refugees that if they have not been sheltered, they can go to the shelter group on the first floor of the Pudong Building to request relief. Arrangements will be made immediately to avoid wandering. It is hoped that people from all walks of life, if they see them along the way, will direct them to the committee, which will also be a great merit.

### A Member of the Battlefield Rescue Team Injured While Rescuing Wounded Soldiers

Yu Hongjiao, the captain of the Chinese Battlefield Rescue Team, led his team to Baziqiao on the 9th to rescue wounded soldiers, and was strafed by enemy aircraft with machine guns, causing nurse Huang Fuhua, number 57, and team member Li Hongwen, number 20, to be injured. They were sent to the Southeast Tiren College for treatment by the team. It is now known that Huang Li was only slightly injured and has recovered. She was discharged from the hospital at 1:00 PM yesterday. According to the nurse's words to the reporter, "As long as we have a breath, we will continue to work hard and not fall behind others."

### Rear Hospitals Urgently Need Cotton Quilts

The National YMCA Military Service Department is providing services to wounded soldiers in rear hospitals. Because the weather is getting colder, the hospitals are in urgent need of cotton quilts. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively donate as much as possible. Donors are requested to send them directly to the YMCA at 131 Museum Road so that they can be transferred to various hospitals for use.

You are concerned about your hometown and cannot bear to sit idly by. You have been diligently planning and operating to relieve the困厄. Your enthusiasm and righteousness are deeply admired. If my humble efforts can help, I will obey. I am especially grateful, and I hope you will understand. Zhang Zhizhong, humbly, respectfully."

### American Missionaries Reluctant to Withdraw

Charitable Work Becomes Even Busier, Chinese Christians Host Regular Banquets to Express Gratitude

The American government previously ordered American citizens in Shanghai to withdraw. However, American Christian missionaries in Shanghai are reluctant to easily abandon the charitable work they have been engaged in for decades. Moreover, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, charitable work has become even busier. Therefore, they have decided to stay in Shanghai and not withdraw. Chinese Christians in Shanghai are moved by the enthusiasm of the American missionaries. Therefore, they have specifically arranged a banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 6 PM this Friday to express their gratitude.

### Famous American Reporter Comments on Modern Chinese Soldiers

Says They Are Now Respected by the People and Bravely Kill the Enemy

Famous American reporter Hal Fothner published an article in the Shanghai Evening Post last night, describing in detail the bravery of Chinese soldiers in combat and the determination of the Chinese people to resist the war. The original text is quite long. The following is a selection of key excerpts translated: "The Chinese people have traditionally looked down on soldiers. As the saying goes, 'Good iron is not used to make nails, good men do not become soldiers.' This is a manifestation of this mentality. Since the brave resistance of the 19th Route Army and two brigades under the 5th Route Army against the Japanese during the January 28th Incident, Chinese soldiers have begun to be admired by the people. The bravery and fearlessness of Chinese soldiers in combat is driven by their hatred of Japanese militarists. People around the world have praised them in unison. The Chinese people, due to Japan's continuous aggression, have also realized the need to build a unified nation. Now China has declared its unification. The nation has a total of two million soldiers, ready to resist the Japanese to the end. Many foreign observers believe that although the Japanese military is stronger, in the current war, the final victory will ultimately belong to China. At the same time, the Chinese people are well aware that if they do not want their motherland to become a Japanese colony, then resistance is almost inevitable. Therefore, in recent years, China has been actively preparing. Various movements, such as the New Life Movement, have stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people. The whole nation, regardless of age, is determined not to submit to Japan, no matter the cost. Although China has not yet reached the point of perfect preparation in terms of material resources, in terms of psychological preparation, every patriotic person is fully prepared. At present, all political differences have been put aside, and the whole nation is united and willing to fight to the death with Japan under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. Chinese soldiers have, for the first time, learned that the people's hearts and minds are behind them."

### Enemy Still Attempts to Break Through the Central Front Line and Invade Lufubridge, Repelled by Our Forces

Driven Back Two Kilometers, Enemy Deaths and Injuries Litter the Field, Fierce Fighting at Mengwan and Zhangzhai in Liuhang Area Yesterday, Artillery Fire Exchanged Between Our Forces and the Enemy from Zhabei to Jiangwan

The following is a report from the front lines obtained by this newspaper this afternoon: (1) The enemy's three general offensives have failed, and they are currently actively reinforcing. Their main force is still concentrated in the Liuhang area, attempting to implement their central breakthrough plan to cut off our rear lines of communication. We have long deployed heavy troops on this line, taking steady steps and building a solid defense. The enemy will never succeed. (2) The enemy has been shelling our Liuhang Lufubridge positions for a day and night without stopping, with approximately several thousand shells fired. Our army has suffered minimal damage. (3) The fighting in the Liuhang area has been concentrated between Mengwan and Zhangzhai in recent days. The enemy has launched several fierce attacks, but we have calmly repelled them, advancing and retreating strategically. Numerous melee combats have taken place, unfolding in the most intense bloodbath. We are holding firmly to our fortified positions, and the enemy's corpses litter the field. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (4) In the Luodian area, approximately 1,500 to 1,600 enemies are attacking our Susun area positions. After several hours of fierce fighting, the entire enemy force has been routed. (5) In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, artillery battles are fierce. The enemy repeatedly harasses us with small units, but we wait for opportunities to attack. There have been no changes to the original front lines.

(Exclusive Interview by This Newspaper) The following is an excerpt from the battlefront news obtained this morning: (1) The bloody battles between Liuhang and Gujiazhai have been extremely fierce in recent days. Last night, our artillery positions bombarded Yanghang fiercely, firing over a thousand shells from 2:00 AM to 9:00 AM. The enemy's defensive lines were destroyed by us and showed signs of retreat. The enemy forces in that area have built artillery fortifications and also bombard us fiercely every day. However, their targeting is not as accurate as our army's, so we have not suffered much damage. (2) As of 4:30 AM this morning, we have advanced three or four li from Liuhang to Yangbang Bridge and its neighboring Gaojia Bridge, Sujiazhai, and other places, holding firmly to the river. The enemy dares not cross the river, and the distance between us is about seventy or eighty meters. (3) The night before, when the enemy launched a major offensive near Liuhang, our rear reinforcements arrived continuously and launched a fierce attack. After about an hour, the enemy forces could not withstand it and retreated one after another. Finally, a large enemy detachment (one battalion) was cut off from their retreat route and surrounded on three sides by us. They surrendered, and we seized over four hundred rifles, ten machine guns and small mortars. Enemy military organization was found among the prisoners. Each squad consisted of twenty-four men, with the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and two first-class soldiers being Japanese. Three, four, six, or seven men in each squad were from the Northeast. Since their defeat in this battle, the enemy has not dared to launch an easy offensive for two days. The villagers in the Liuhang area have long been dispersed. Those who remain, apart from the extremely poor and elderly, are mostly not good people. Recently, we uncovered two major spy dens and detained over sixty people, all of whom confessed without being beaten.

### Lufubridge Bayonet Fight

Enemy Shells for Three Hours, We Suffer No Damage, Enemy Attempts to Approach Our Positions, Are Painfully Repelled and Driven Back

In the Liuhang area, fierce battles continue incessantly. The enemy forces are still carrying out their plan to break through our central front line, attacking our positions in the Liuhang area particularly fiercely. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy concentrated its artillery fire and launched a fierce bombardment of our positions near Lufubridge, firing over a thousand shells. After shelling for three hours, until dawn yesterday morning, the enemy infantry began to advance on our positions. Our army responded calmly, waiting for them to advance to in front of our positions before suddenly leaping out of the trenches and launching a painful counterattack, charging forward fiercely. Under the heroic charge and bayonet fight of our army, the enemy retreated one after another, and we drove the enemy back about two kilometers. Enemy deaths and injuries littered the field, and abandoned weapons were everywhere.

### Fierce Bloody Battles at Zhangzhai and Mengwan

As of This Morning, Still Deadlocked with the Enemy at Yangjiufang

At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, over twenty enemy aircraft circled and reconnoitered over our Youmeizhai positions, followed by bombing. At the same time, their artillery units also began to move, bombarding us. Our army suffered minimal damage. Towards 7:00 or 8:00 PM in the evening, the enemy forces facing our Zhangzhai line launched a fierce offensive. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, and tanks also shielded their infantry charge. Our army rose up to meet them, showing no fear, and engaged them in battle. In the end, because the Zhangzhai position was too exposed and vulnerable to attacks from three sides, it was not easy to defend. The fierce fighting continued until about midnight when our reinforcements arrived, and the bloody battle began again. As of this morning, we are still engaged in fierce fighting and deadlock with the enemy in the Yangjiufang and Wangjiufang areas. At 1:00 AM last night, enemy artillery fire also fiercely attacked our positions in the Mengwan area, and infantry also attempted to advance. Our army bravely resisted, and the enemy failed to succeed. By about 2:00 AM, the enemy suffered too many casualties and could not withstand it, collapsing and retreating.

### Enemy in Luodian Attacks Again Yesterday

Fierce Fighting at Susun Positions Continues Until This Afternoon

The enemy still cannot forget their dream of breaking through Luodian, and have repeatedly suffered heavy blows from our army. The number of their elite troops lost in that area accounts for over half of their total. However, the enemy's ambition has not died, and they still focus on that line, waiting for reinforcements and resupply, not daring to launch a large-scale offensive, but the fighting continues constantly and has not stopped. Last night, the enemy again began to attack our positions facing them in that area. Our army rose up and launched a fierce counterattack. The sounds of machine guns, rifles, and mortars did not cease all night. At the same time, approximately 1,500 to 1,600 enemies north and south of Susun attacked our Susun positions. Fierce fighting has continued until this afternoon and has not yet stopped.

### Artillery Battles on Both Sides Between Zhabei and Jiangwan

Exchanged Fire Since Last Night Until This Morning

The enemy on the Zhabei and Jiangwan line has been constantly firing on our positions with artillery since last night. Our army also returned fire accordingly. The two sides exchanged fire until this morning. However, there was no major contact between infantry, and there have been no changes to our front lines.

### Enemy Aircraft Scout Everywhere This Morning

Also Open Fire on Refugees with Machine Guns, Many Injured, Truly Inhumane

Starting at 8:00 AM today, two enemy aircraft flew from the Pudong area to scout, then flew low and strafed passersby with machine guns, flying from Lujiazui to Yangjiadu Tangqiao South Wharf, crossing the river to the Nanshi area to scout, and then returning along the same route. At the same time, they also scattered absurd leaflets.

According to refugees who escaped from the Pudong area and spoke to a Dagongshe reporter, at about 7:00 AM this morning, two enemy aircraft scouted in the Pudong area and flew very low. At that time, many refugees were trying to come to Shanghai, which was seen by the enemy aircraft, which then used machine guns to indiscriminately strafe downwards. It is reported that many people were injured, which is truly inhumane.

### Enemy Aircraft Twice Raid the Capital Through the Tunnel

Our Air Force Intercepts Them in the Suburbs, Twenty-Odd Enemy Aircraft Break Through and Enter the Skies Over the Capital, Four Enemy Aircraft Shot Down by Our Air Force, Several Fires in the City Extinguished

[Nanjing] 10:00 AM this morning, the Nanjing City authorities issued an alert stating that a large squadron of thirty or forty enemy aircraft were flying to attack the capital. A large number of our aircraft immediately took off and flew to the suburbs to intercept them. The air battle was extremely fierce. At 10:30 AM, over ten enemy aircraft broke through and appeared in the skies over the capital. For a time, dense anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns fired into the air, and several were shot down by us. The exact number is still being investigated. Our losses are still minimal. There were several fires in the south of the city and the northwest corner, which were quickly extinguished. The alert was lifted at 11:20 AM. (Urgent telegram from the afternoon of the 22nd)

[Nanjing] There were approximately sixty enemy aircraft in total that attacked the capital this morning. After a large number of our aircraft took off to intercept them, about twenty-odd aircraft managed to reach the skies over the capital. As a result, four were shot down by us. Two fell in the suburbs, one fell in Xiaguan, and the other fell in Daxinggong. The aircraft bodies were completely destroyed, and the pilots were all killed on the spot. Our losses were minimal. (Urgent telegram from 1:00 PM on the 22nd)

[Nanjing] When enemy aircraft attacked the capital for the first time this morning, bombs also fell near the American Embassy in Gulou, making a loud noise. Fortunately, the American Embassy was unharmed, and the staff remaining in the embassy were only frightened. An additional four enemy aircraft were shot down, with one falling in Daxinggong, one falling in Pukou, one falling in Xiaguan, and one falling in Mao'er Mountain. (Urgent telegram from 2:30 PM on the 22nd)

[Nanjing] At 1:20 PM this afternoon, the Nanjing City authorities issued a second alert stating that dozens of enemy aircraft were attacking the capital for the second time. At the same time, our air force immediately flew out to engage them. At about 2:00 PM, several enemy aircraft again managed to reach the skies over the capital. For a time, our anti-aircraft guns and artillery roared. The enemy aircraft frantically dropped bombs aimlessly and then flew away. Our losses were minimal. The alert was lifted at 2:45 PM this afternoon. More details to follow. (Urgent telegram from 3:30 PM on the 22nd)

### Indiscriminate Bombing Violates Public Law, Britain and the United States Lodge Protests with Japan

British Embassy Determined Not to Leave Nanjing, United States Declares Policy Toward China Unchanged

[London] After the announcement of Japan's plan to bomb Nanjing on a large scale, Britain will lodge a protest with the Japanese government. Responsible parties here recently declared that the contents of the protest include three points: (1) British warships will never leave the waters of Xiaguan. As for the British Embassy, it is a diplomatic agency of Britain stationed in a friendly country and will never leave Nanjing. (2) Britain does not recognize Japan's right to make such requests or recommendations to British authorities within Chinese territory. (3) If British lives are lost or British property is damaged, the right to demand compensation will be reserved. British political figures recently believed that Britain is determined to maintain all its rights. This protest is intended to warn Japan, but it may not affect Japan's attitude.

### Enemy Continues to Send Reinforcements, Part of Which Has Already Arrived in Shanghai

One Division and One Brigade, Approximately 40,000 Men in Total

Central News Agency reports that it has been forty days since the enemy invaded Shanghai. Not only has there been no progress, but they have also repeatedly encountered strong resistance from our army. The total number of deaths and injuries, including the regular army, as well as the Taiwan Army, Korean Army, and puppet Manchukuo Army, is approximately 20,000. Therefore, in order to actively replenish their forces to facilitate another large-scale invasion, the enemy continues to seek aid from within the country. Currently, one division and one brigade, totaling approximately 40,000 men, have been sent as reinforcements. A portion of them has already been transported to Shanghai by three enemy cruisers and multiple transport ships. The cruisers are still docked outside the Wusongkou, attempting to land at various ports along the Yangtze River. As for the Huangpu River, two enemy transport ships, No. 286 Sakaemaru and No. 224 Toyokawamaru, sailed in at around 6:00 AM this morning (22nd), docking at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves. Approximately 3,000 enemy reinforcements wearing yellow uniforms landed and boarded eighty or ninety trucks parked on the wharf, heading towards the Hongkou area.

### League of Nations Advisory Committee Holds First Meeting Yesterday

Decides to Invite Representatives from China and Japan to Attend, Meeting Postponed Until Next Monday

[Geneva] The Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem of the League of Nations General Assembly held a short meeting at 6:00 PM today. The Latvian Foreign Minister Mantis was elected as chairman, and it was decided to invite China, Japan, Australia, and Germany to participate in the work. The committee is currently planning to continue the meeting next Monday (the 27th of this month). If these countries can provide answers in Geneva by then, the meeting date may be advanced. It is not certain. A Harveys Agency reporter recently learned that China will accept the invitation to participate in the work of the Advisory Committee, but Japan will definitely refuse and will explain the reasons for the refusal. Currently, the Japanese government is quite uneasy about the League of Nations' intervention in the dispute between China and Japan. This can be seen from the fact that the country's observers are now actively promoting it in Geneva. The Advisory Committee was originally composed of twenty-three countries: Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, Portugal, Ireland, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, and Canada. Germany has already withdrawn from the League of Nations, so it must be invited. As for inviting Australia, it was advocated by Britain. (Central News Agency telegram from Harveys on the 21st)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull stated today that the United States has protested to Japan against the Japanese bombing of Nanjing. The reasons for this protest are as follows: (1) Bombing non-combatants is contrary to international and humanitarian public law. (2) Bombing will endanger the American diplomatic representatives stationed in Nanjing, thus hindering the normal relations between China and the United States. At the time the United States raised this protest in Tokyo, the State Department was unaware that Britain had also taken the same action. (Reuters telegram from Washington on the 22nd)

### American Ambassador Withdraws from Nanjing

Evening Star Publishes Article Criticizing, Considers It a Base Humiliation

[Washington] An editorial in the Evening Star today criticized the withdrawal of the American Ambassador from Nanjing, saying that this ungraceful retreat is entirely the fault of Washington. This is not only ungraceful but is also considered a base humiliation, which is not appropriate for a major country like the United States. What is particularly disgusting is that the United States took this action under threat, while other countries such as Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy have all decided not to leave Nanjing. (Reuters telegram from Washington on the 21st)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement stating that with regard to Japan's plan to bomb Nanjing on a large scale, US Ambassador to Japan Grew was ordered to protest to the Tokyo government. At the same time, the State Department also lodged a similar protest with the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito. The basis for this American protest is the provision of international law prohibiting the bombing of ordinary people. Hull further mentioned the matter of the American Embassy in China moving to a warship in the waters of Xiaguan, saying that diplomatic relations between China and the United States have not been interrupted as a result, and the United States' policy toward China has not changed. As for the whereabouts of Ambassador Johnson and the embassy staff, he does not need to ask about them. The relationship between the United States and the Chinese government remains exactly the same as when Ambassador Johnson was stationed at the American Embassy in Nanjing.

### Japan Submits Formal Reply Regarding the Case of the British Ambassador Being Wounded by a Japanese Aircraft

[London] Responsible parties recently confirmed that with regard to the case of British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being attacked by a Japanese aircraft, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has submitted a formal reply to British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive. The contents of the reply are not yet known. (Central News Agency telegram from Harveys on the 21st)

This was the third attack by Japanese aircraft in twenty-four hours. Chinese aircraft rose to engage them, and anti-aircraft guns also fired into the air. The sound rumbled, and residents were awakened from their sleep. (Reuters telegram from Guangzhou on the 22nd)

### Short Commentary

— Phase

Pride, anger, starvation, and chaos. These are the most feared by military strategists. Therefore, if a military operation has even one of these, it is enough to cause failure. How much more so if it combines all four? Military strategy says, "A proud army will be defeated." Pride leads to underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy leads to defeat. This principle is known to everyone. But when defeat comes, one becomes agitated and angry beyond control. Thus, one disregards reason, uses any means, and ignores everything in order to achieve one's goals. But when encountering a strong enemy, strong resistance, and a decline in morale, there is no turning back. Therefore, it is said to be an "angry army." The spirit of an angry army is easily exhausted. Thus comes starvation. When starvation comes, morale wavers, actions become chaotic, command is ineffective, and soldiers lack the will to fight. Thus comes chaos. When the army becomes chaotic, collapse is imminent. Japan has now committed the sin of a proud army and is in a state of angry soldiers. It is pouring its national army into the war, gambling everything in the hope of reversing the decline. However, this hope will definitely not achieve its goal. It can be predicted that starvation and chaos will soon follow.

### Small Handicrafts for Battlefield Application

— Zhou Rujie

Everyone knows that as science advances day by day, so do the weapons of war. The tactics and weapons of the primitive era have completely lost their effectiveness in modern times. The area of battle has also gradually expanded, and the methods of killing have become even more deadly. In the era of planar warfare, the scope of war was limited to the soldiers participating in the battle on the front lines of the opposing side. In modern three-dimensional warfare, the air force has broken through the planar boundaries, and there is no longer any distinction between front and rear. Once war breaks out, the army, navy, and air force will immediately mobilize, and the entire enemy can be destroyed. During the European war, Germany used the omnipotence of science to invent poison gas warfare. As a result, the "art of killing" advanced by leaps and bounds. At that time, the participating countries suffered great losses, which aroused the attention of countries around the world to poison gas warfare. Scientists and military experts in various countries are burying themselves in research on how to use poison gas to destroy the enemy, and how to use the most appropriate methods and equipment to defend against poison gas attacks in preparation for the Second World War.

Our country's science is inherently backward, and it is also restricted by economic factors. The preparation for poison gas warfare can be said to be "willing in spirit but lacking in strength." However, the national crisis has reached a serious "critical juncture." The artillery fire at Lugou Bridge opened the prelude to the full-scale Sino-Japanese war. During this entire period of national salvation struggle, preparation for gas defense is an urgent task. We know that the Japanese imperialists' aggression against China is completely manipulated by the so-called fascist group of young officers. They are completely using war to deceive the sympathy of their people, and the Japanese soldiers, either are pampered in peacetime and their living habits are not suitable for the battlefield environment, or they are purely newly recruited soldiers with no combat experience. Once a war breaks out, they come to confront the Chinese soldiers who have been through many battles. Although the weapons are advanced, the morale is low, and failure is inevitable. When the battle becomes unfavorable, they will definitely disregard everything and implement poison gas warfare. In the past battles of Shanghai, Xifengkou, and the recent Lugou Bridge, Japan has already begun to use poison gas warfare. We have already suffered several losses. If we don't study defense methods earlier, it is almost like sitting and waiting for death.

The several kinds of poison gas defense handicrafts mentioned here are based on the principles of being the most economical, the most universal, and the simplest. I hope that after listening to the lecture, compatriots from all walks of life will manufacture them according to the law, and I hope that the radio instructors in the public education centers in various places will earnestly guide the public to manufacture them on a large scale, so that everyone can be "prepared for a rainy day." Then we can win the final victory in this war.

1.  Gas Mask Suit

The poisonous gas used in modern warfare is probably "Iprite," a blistering agent; "Phosgene," an asphyxiant; "Diphosgene," a sneeze agent; and "Picrin," a lachrymatory agent. Each of these has its own function, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In Europe and the United States, rubber is often used to make clothes and pants to wear on the body to defend against poisonous gas. This kind of rubber clothing is very expensive, costing at least about a hundred yuan, which is definitely beyond the economic capacity of ordinary people. The method of making a gas mask suit introduced here is extremely simple, economical, and the gas protection effect is also good.

Materials: ㊀ Fish oil, ㊁ Tung oil, ㊂ Sesame oil, ㊃ Siccative. (These four items can be purchased in paint shops.) ㊄ Silk or cloth, ㊅ Rubber band.

Tools: ㊀ Copper pot, ㊁ Charcoal stove, ㊂ Wooden stick, ㊃ Silk thread.

Method: Make clothes and pants with silk or cloth, sew a rubber band into the cuffs and trouser legs, and finally make a style in which the clothes and pants are connected. The clothes, gloves, socks, and hoods (such as hood-shaped items) worn by the illusionist in the rubber playground are worn on the body, and the principle is to be airtight. After the clothes and other items are made, use half of the fish oil, two and a half of the sesame oil, and five parts of tung oil, mix and boil them, stir them thoroughly, then add 5% of the drier, cook for another hour, stir vigorously and evenly, let it stand to cool, dip the silk thread in oil and vigorously wipe each part of the front of the clothes. Headgear, gloves, and socks are all handled in the same way. After wiping the oil, hang them in a ventilated place to dry, and then wipe them four or five times in the same way to complete them. Usually, you should practice putting on and taking them off more often to avoid being at a loss and confused at the critical moment.

㊁ Mask

The above is all about protecting the whole body from being attacked by poison gas. However, the mouth and nose cannot be covered with such oily cloth, which would hinder breathing. Most countries use gas masks, but these gas masks are definitely beyond the economic means of our average compatriots. Since this is the case, we have to think of a remedy. The masks introduced here are affordable for the average economic means, and the manufacturing method is also extremely simple.

Materials: ㊀ Sodium carbonate, ㊁ Clean water, ㊂ Absorbent cotton, ㊃ Gauze, ㊄ Straps.

Tools: ㊀ Porcelain basin, ㊁ Large-mouthed glass bottle.

Method: Mix 20% of sodium carbonate and 70% of clean water in a porcelain basin. After it is dissolved, pour it into a large-mouthed bottle. Use two layers of gauze with two layers of absorbent cotton in the middle, with an area of about four inches. Sew around with cloth and nail straps on both sides. Use the number of your family members as the number of masks to be made. It is best to make two for each person. Soak the finished mask in sodium carbonate solution. When encountering poison, take out the mask from the bottle and cover it on the mouth and nose. Tie the straps tightly around the head. If the mask feels dry, quickly replace it with a second piece.

Another type of economical mask is a little more troublesome, but its effectiveness is better than the first type. Those who are interested may wish to try it.

Materials: ㊀ Old cigarette cans, ㊁ Sodium carbonate, ㊂ Old woolen fabric (such as old felt, woolen socks, woolen sweaters, etc.), ㊃ Absorbent cotton, ㊄ Gauze, ㊅ Activated carbon (bought from a drugstore) or charcoal powder ㊆ Clean water.

Method: Nail several small holes in the cigarette can (nail from the inside to the outside), and then pinch the can mouth into an oval shape by hand. Solder a small ring on each side of the can mouth to buckle the strap. Then use 30% sodium carbonate and 70% clear water solution. Soak the gauze and absorbent cotton in the liquid. At this time, put the old woolen fabric in the can, then put one inch thick of activated carbon or charcoal powder, then take the gauze and cotton out of the liquid and place it on the activated carbon. When encountering poison, you can cover your mouth and nose, but a layer of rubber or cloth should be added to the can mouth, so that it will not rub against the skin and make it airtight.

㊂ Rainproof cloth

During wartime, people feel extremely difficult when encountering heavy rain. During the Lugou Bridge battle, it happened to be raining heavily, and the refugees were all complaining. Summer is fine, but if it is in winter, they may freeze to death even if they are not killed by artillery fire. I am introducing a kind of rainproof cloth here. Its properties are somewhat like water encountering lotus leaves. It simply doesn't stick to water at all. Everyone can prepare one to avoid suffering from heavy rain on the battlefield.

Materials: ㊀ Aluminum acetate, ㊁ Alum, ㊂ Clean water, ㊃ Long shirt or sheet. Tools: ㊀ Porcelain basin, ㊁ Mortar, ㊂ Iron (optional, but the effect is better with ironing).

Method: Grind one part of aluminum acetate and one part of alum into fine powder, and mix them with fifty parts of clean water to form a clear liquid. Soak the clothes or sheets in the liquid for ten to twenty minutes, take them out, let them dry, and iron them flat with an iron. If you encounter rain while escaping, put it on immediately or drape the sheet over your body, which is more convenient than ordinary raincoats. Compatriots from all walks of life may wish to try it.

Small Handicrafts for Battlefield Application

㊃ Clothing disinfectant

Disinfection of clothing and utensils is very important. The gas mask suit mentioned above must be thoroughly disinfected after encountering poisonous gas, otherwise there is great danger. The simplest medicines and methods for disinfecting clothes are described in detail below.

Materials: ㊀ Soap, ㊁ Baking soda, ㊂ Clean water.

Tools: ㊀ Porcelain basin, ㊁ Rubber gloves or wooden stick.

Preparation: Mix 200 grams of soap and 10 grams of baking soda with clean water in a basin. First soak the clothes contaminated with poisonous gas in clean water, then take them out and put them in the solution. Put on rubber gloves and shake the clothes, or stir the clothes with a wooden stick, then take them out and boil them in soapy water, and then rinse them with clean water to disinfect them.

㊄ Fire extinguishing liquid

Fires are common during wartime, especially when the enemy throws incendiary bombs, and the fire hazard is even greater. At this time, in addition to preparing plenty of clean water, every household should especially prepare plenty of fire extinguishing liquid. However, the fire extinguishing liquid sold on the market is very expensive, so it is better to make it yourself, which is both economical and convenient. In this extraordinary period, every household should prepare more to be used in case of fire.

Materials: ㊀ Ammonium mercuric chloride, ㊁ Sodium mercuric chloride, ㊂ Clean water.

Tools: Large basin or wooden bucket, kerosene can.

Method: Mix one tael and seven mace of ammonium mercuric chloride, twenty parts of sodium mercuric chloride, and twenty-four taels of clear water. (This is the lowest amount to prepare. If you want to make more, you can increase it according to this method.) Mix them in a basin, then pour in the clear water and stir thoroughly, then put them in a kerosene can and store them at home. The can should be marked with "Fire extinguishing liquid" for use at any time.

The several small handicrafts mentioned above are all extremely simple, extremely economical, and the materials are extremely convenient to obtain, and the manufacturing methods are very easy. I hope that compatriots from all walks of life will take them as a reference, and I hope everyone will give us guidance!

### Wang Xiaolai's Important Talk: Resistance and National Salvation Depend on Self-Reliance

Recalling the Past Sino-American Friendship, Feeling Infinite Regret and Indignation

Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, yesterday issued an important speech saying, "China and the United States, the two major republics, are located in the two major hemispheres of the East and West. Both are peace-loving and justice-upholding nations. For decades, they have maintained good relations. This time, China is resisting Japan in order to defend peace and resist aggression. It is expected that the American nation will be able to give deep sympathy and righteous assistance. Unexpectedly, when our country notified the embassies of various countries to inform their warships to avoid approaching Japanese warships, the United States refused. When Japan notified various countries to allow foreign warships to moor in the upper reaches of Xiaguan in the Yangtze River, it acted alone. Comparing the two, it is clear that there is a distinction between them. At the same time, the President of the United States issued an order banning the shipment of military supplies to China and Japan, equating the resisters of aggression with the perpetrators of aggression. No wonder the Washington Post of the United States also expressed opposition to this ban. We feel infinite regret and indignation for this kind of action by the United States, recalling the past friendship. We deeply hope that the American people will quickly correct it and pass on the glorious history of the two major nations forever. Furthermore, our compatriots should also be aware that resistance and national salvation depend on self-reliance. Dr. Sun Yat-sen showed us that we should unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and strive together. After careful examination of his instructions, we must first rely on ourselves to fight together with others. Second, only with nations that truly treat us equally can we unite. The facts are like this. I hope that our compatriots will always understand this teaching and become more and more vigorous."

### Boy Scout Zhang Yaosheng is Brave and Commendable

Bravely Captured a Bandit on Avenue Edward VII. The Public Works Department Awarded Zhang a Silver Shield in Recognition

Zhang Yaosheng, a member of the Shanghai Youth Boy Scout Corps, is extremely brave and does not avoid difficulties in handling affairs. On the 12th of this month, he was passing through the intersection of Avenue Foch and Chongqing Road when a robbery occurred at the Dahua Motor Company on Avenue Edward VII. The bandit Chen Zhengyu refused to be arrested and fled. Zhang bravely stepped forward and hugged him and sent him to the Chengdu Road Patrol Station. It is now known that the General Police Department of the Public Works Department believes that Zhang is commendable for his righteousness and has specially made a large silver shield, which was awarded to Zhang yesterday. It is also heard that Wang Gang, the head of the corps, also specially made a medal of honor as a gift to encourage him.

### First Board Meeting of the Wartime Popular Education Corps

Resolved to Establish Public Schools and Support National Salvation Drama Education

Since its establishment on the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Wartime Popular Education Service Corps has been actively carrying out all popular education work. The first board meeting was held the night before last (20th). Nine directors, including Shen Tilan and Deng Yuzhi, attended. Yang Dongchun was elected as chairman and Fang Yu as the recorder. Nine important cases were discussed and decided. Among them, the most important ones were the immediate establishment of ten alley schools, street children's schools, and public schools, as well as supporting the "Children's Troupe" to step up the promotion of national salvation drama education to awaken the people's resistance to the enemy and national salvation. The second training course has also been decided to be prepared and will be officially opened within a week.

### Municipal Secondary Schools Plan to Jointly Move to the Interior

Jingye and Wusong Will Move to Eastern Zhejiang

In view of the Shanghai environment, the six municipal secondary schools, including Wuben and Xinlu, cannot continue to start school for a while, and the students are wasting time and abandoning their studies, which is not a long-term plan for the war of resistance. Therefore, there is a proposal to jointly move to the interior to start school. The method is being drafted. It is also learned that Jingye Middle School of the municipality will jointly move to Lanxi or Yongkang, Zhejiang with Wusong Middle School to continue running the school. The school is currently located at the National Light Middle School, and is conducting a survey of students' will to see if they are willing to go to school with them, or plan to transfer or borrow from other schools.

### Recent Developments of Various Service Corps

The Shanghai Cultural Circle Inland Service Corps, a total of 23 members of the corps, including three female members, were divided into three teams. Liu Naifu was appointed as the head of the corps, and they took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Jiaxing at 7 pm on September 13. At that time, it was raining continuously, and the 31st bridge (between Songjiang and Shihudang) was destroyed by the enemy, and the train could not pass. All the members got off the train and trudged through the rain in the dark. They arrived in Jiaxing the next morning. On the morning of the 16th, they walked in the rain to promote the situation of the war of resistance to the villagers along the way. The results were quite good. At 2 pm, they arrived in Puyuan and convened an expanded propaganda meeting in the Chamber of Commerce. Hundreds of people attended the meeting. The corps explained the awareness of the war of resistance, the situation of the war of resistance, and the future of the war of resistance, and sang national salvation songs. The next day, each team went to the streets to promote the propaganda, and a national defense art exhibition was held in the Chamber of Commerce, including woodcuts, paintings, and war of resistance photos, which were able to inspire the people's morale. In the afternoon, at the invitation of Jiaxing Puyuan Elementary School, Tongxiang Central Elementary School, and the Changdi Strong Men Cadre Training Office, they attended lecture meetings and taught national salvation songs and common sense of first aid and air defense. It is heard that after the corps performs the plays "Put Down Your Whip", "Save a Bullet", "Refugees and Soldiers" on the 18th, it will set off to Tongxiang according to the planned route. The Shanghai Youth Battlefield Service Corps is working hard on the battlefield. The rescue team enters and exits the war zone to rescue the wounded soldiers, and the results are quite good. Since being incorporated into the Fifth Emergency Rescue Team of the Red Cross, the work has become extremely intense. In order to adjust the physical strength of the team members and increase their effectiveness, they have implemented a grouping rotation system. It is also heard that the corps believes that propaganda work is also important, and plans to organize a propaganda team, which is divided into two groups, one staying in Shanghai and the other in the interior. It is being planned. According to Chu Erfeng, the head of the corps, the frontline battles have been fierce in the past few days, and the wounded soldiers have been sent to □□ Hospital for bandaging and then sent to the interior. □□ Talking about the frontline soldiers of our army, they often talk to the frontline outposts of the enemy army. They are all our Northeastern compatriots who were deceived and forced by the enemy to come to Shanghai. When they are fighting, they fire their guns into the sky and wait quietly for the opportunity to revolt. In addition, all the expenses of the corps are self-raised, which is very costly, and the economy is not enough. We hope that people from all walks of life and colleagues in the soy sauce industry will give us financial assistance, such as cars. Dry food, raincoats, medical supplies, Bāguà yuán (a type of medicine), Rén dān (a type of medicine), etc. are urgently needed. The corps address is No. 40, Shouxiang Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi.

The Shanghai Youth Singing Team has launched the organization of a wartime service corps, with a communication office at No. 51, Lane 71, Burton Road. Member registration is being handled. If any members have changed their address due to the war, please send a letter to notify us so that we can train them and then send them to work in various places.

### Rushing to Make Cotton Vests

Women's Groups Undertake 50,000 Pieces

Various women's groups in the city met and agreed to donate 50,000 vests for the soldiers. It is heard that more than 20 groups, including the Women's Comfort Group, the Women's Movement Promotion Association, and the YWCA, are carrying out the work separately, and it is expected that a considerable number will be completed within the day and collected and handed over to the Comfort Committee. In addition, the Comfort Committee will issue formal receipts for the donation of cotton vests to verify the facts.

YWCA Seeks Members to Participate

The Shanghai Chinese Christian Youth Association is urgently in need of a large number of cotton vests for the brave soldiers fighting against the enemy on the front lines to keep them warm. It is now seeking to have members, family members, or neighbors and friends sew them. We hope that they will actively participate in the rush to make them so that they can be forwarded to the front lines. All those who participate in the work should collect the cloth from the association and bring it back to rush to make it. Each time, the maximum should not exceed five days. The faster the better. However, please donate the cotton, which costs about two dimes per piece.

### McTyeire School Alumnae Discuss Wartime Affairs

In view of the increasingly serious situation and the need for long-term resistance, the Shanghai McTyeire School Alumnae Association has decided to hold a meeting of all alumnae at the Shanghai YWCA at 323 Moore Road, Jing'an Temple Road, at 4 pm on Friday, September 24, to discuss the work that should be done during the war. It is expected that patriotic alumnae will attend at that time.

### The Dairy Industry in Shanghai's War

Dairy Farmers Generously Donate Milk, Benefiting Countless Needy Infants

The 13 dairy farms in the city have been directly affected by the outbreak of the war. Several dairy farmers in the war zone have transported their cows to safe places, but there are still those who have not left the dangerous area. The losses are still difficult to accurately estimate. Baoda Farm suffered the most damage. All the real estate, machinery, and stored milk were sacrificed under the bombs. However, although most of the dairy farms have been damaged, there is no shortage of milk in the concession. In the beginning of the outbreak of the war, there were still about 5,000 pounds left every day, because many milk subscribers left the concession. For the sake of patients in the teaching hospitals and a large number of malnourished children and poor people, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession contacted various dairy farmers to donate milk. One dairy farm agreed to sell it at a reduced price, and the rest of the dairy farms generously supplied the stored milk free of charge. From August 21 to September 15, a total of 14 dairy farms, including Columbia Farm, Liyuan Farm, Standard Milk Company, and other enthusiastic dairy farmers, provided 6,409 pounds of milk free of charge. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession distributed the milk donated by the manufacturers as appropriate and sent personnel to various hospitals. The patients in Renji Hospital and Gongji Hospital, the refugees in the Public Works Department warehouse shelter, Fuzhou Road Market shelter, New World shelter, Xinxin Company shelter, and Qingliang Temple shelter, as well as the Salvation Army, have all benefited. Now the output of each dairy farm is gradually decreasing, and the number of drinkers is gradually increasing. Therefore, the total amount of free supply per day has been reduced to about 100 pounds. The Public Works Department hopes that this kind of supply will continue, so that refugees, especially infants with insufficient breast milk, will benefit greatly. The dairy farms in the safe area are now operating as usual, but the time for sending milk every morning has been slightly delayed due to the martial law in the concession. There is plenty of food and grass for the cows to eat. The difficulties that the manufacturers felt at the beginning of the war have been reduced. Milk prices have increased slightly compared to normal days (Grade A sterilized milk is 33 cents to 34 cents per pint, Grade A milk is 34 cents to 40 cents, and Grade B milk is 20 cents to 25 cents). Each dairy farm has been temporarily inspected by the Health Department, and the situation is very good. Milk drinkers can rest assured.
