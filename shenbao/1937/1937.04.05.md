[Xi'an] Text of the Central Executive Committee's Memorial to the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum: "On the occasion of the National Tomb Sweeping Day, April 4th, the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in remembrance of the achievements of our ancestors, desires to enlighten those who come to understand their heritage and to revitalize the spirit of our nation. We specially dispatch members Zhang Ji and Gu Zhutong to travel to the mausoleum to represent us in paying tribute to the tomb of our founding ancestor, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, saying: 'Looking back to the distant past, the world was in a primitive state, heaven created the earth, and the people lacked laws and regulations. It was our Yellow Emperor who received the mandate of heaven, founded the nation, and established the foundation, leading the people. He initiated systems and rules, regulated all industries, and the feudal lords relied on his influence and all became his followers. He established calendars to record time, created characters to record events, built palaces and clothing, and created a wealth of cultural artifacts. The wicked Chiyou, who dared to resist, caused chaos. He resolutely punished the disobedient, establishing a permanent distinction between the Chinese and barbarians. We admire his achievements, which have spread to all regions, and he has blessed and inspired future generations to expand and promote them. In pursuit of his legacy, our people have never slackened, protecting our people, relying on the spirits of our ancestors. Remembering the dew of spring, the sacrificial ceremonies are completed, and we present these offerings to invite you to come and enjoy. Respectfully presented.'" (Central News Agency, 3rd)

The text reads: 'O Emperor, your wisdom encompasses all things, and your grace extends to the entire world. You lifted the masses from suffering and secured the foundation of the nation. You mobilized troops in Zhuolu to conquer the feudal lords, and unified the wilderness. You quelled chaos with weapons and created peace with systems. Your great virtue and far-reaching plans are still relied upon today. Today, on this auspicious day of Qingming, we renew the ancient rituals of sacrifice. The mausoleum is lush and green, as if we are beholding the majesty of your bow and sword. The torches are bright, as if we are hearing the elegant music of Yunmen. We hope that your spirit in heaven will observe our sincerity, silently enlighten our people, and unite our hearts and minds, turning disasters into blessings and advancing the world towards longevity. We earnestly rely on your great favor to accomplish great achievements. We have prepared the rituals with purity and sincerity, and humbly beseech your acceptance.'" (Central News Agency, 4th)

### Ministries of Finance and Railways Reorganize the Hukuang Railway Bonds

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways issued a notice regarding the reorganization of the Hukuang Railway Loan. The outstanding amount of the Hukuang Railway Loan of 1911 is approximately £5,650,000 in British currency. A reorganization plan has been drafted to reduce the interest rate payable in the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China and to revise the redemption method. Other provisions in the loan contract will remain unchanged. The articles of this reorganization plan are as follows: ㊀ The interest for the years 26 and 27 of the Republic of China will be paid at a rate of 2.5% per week, and thereafter at a rate of 5%. The interest will be paid from the net surplus of the railway and guaranteed by the salt tax. From January 1, 30th year of the Republic of China, subsequent interest payments will be guaranteed by customs duties, with the order of precedence calculated from the date of this notice. ㊁ Redemption of principal will commence in the 30th year of the Republic of China, calculated from the 26th year, and will be completed within 39 years, according to the redemption schedule issued to the managing banks. The redemption of principal and interest, and the payment of the receipts issued according to Article 3 of this plan, will be made from the net surplus of the railway. Any shortfall will be supplemented by the Ministry of Finance from tax revenues. The government may, with appropriate notice, increase the amount of redemption at any redemption date without additional cost. Bonds that have been drawn but not redeemed shall be redeemed in the order in which they were drawn. ㊂ Accrued interest will be changed from the original 5% to 1% per week simple interest and paid in the form of non-interest-bearing receipts. The interest underpaid during the 26th and 27th years will also be paid at one-fifth of the value in the form of non-interest-bearing receipts. These receipts will be redeemed starting in the 31st year of the Republic of China and will be cleared within approximately 20 years. The amount paid each year should be roughly equal, except that the government may reserve the right to transfer up to 50% of the amount payable in the first three years to the last two years. ㊃ The reorganization plan should be separately ordered to the Inspector General of Customs, the Chief Inspectorate of Salt Revenue, the Central Bank, and the Railway Administration for compliance. It is further stated that the railway authorities are currently seeking to rectify railway administration and improve management in accordance with the purpose of the loan contract, so that the government and bondholders may benefit together.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Reading the 25th Annual Business Report of the Bank of China

— Liu

The 25th Annual Business Report of the Bank of China was released yesterday. Regarding the industrial, commercial, and financial situation during this year, the report lists the increasing concentration of currency management, the abnormal stability of foreign exchange, the significant rebound in prices, the revival of industry and commerce, and the improvement of foreign trade. It also states, "These positive results can be attributed to last year's bumper harvests, but also show that the initial domestic and international concerns about the implementation of the new currency system were somewhat excessive... Today, the success of managing the currency system depends on the people's belief in the intentions and capabilities of the management authorities. Without this belief, even if the currency authorities have huge reserves, it will be difficult to maintain the stability of the currency system." This statement is accurate. The success of any undertaking depends on "ability" and "credit." Economic markets may be temporarily stimulated by other factors, but the stability of their foundation still depends on the strength of general purchasing power. In terms of domestic reasons only, the most important reason for the improvement in the economic situation last year was the good harvest in various places, followed by the trust of the people in the leading banks after the currency reform. However, this was not accidental.

Taking the Bank of China as an example, the Bank of China has achieved its current position not only because of its capable managers and appropriate measures, but also because its refusal to obey Yuan Shikai's illegal orders was a major reason for its deeply ingrained credit. Since then, the people of the country have known that the Bank of China can withstand the powerful and only seek the interests of depositors and bondholders. They are willing to transfer the trust they used to have in foreign banks to the Bank of China. Therefore, in recent years, the situation has changed repeatedly, and the Bank of China has shown its progress in its business. According to this report, the Bank of China accounts for an absolute majority of 42.79% of the total legal tender issued. The total amount of deposits jumped from 766 million yuan in the 24th year to 978 million yuan in the 25th year. Savings deposits were only started in May of the 24th year, and by the end of the year, they had reached 43.1 million yuan. By the end of the 25th year, they had almost doubled to over 85.6 million yuan. These figures are clear proof of the general public's trust in the Bank of China. However, we still hope that the bank can continue to maintain its credit and serve as a long-term shield for China's social economy.

Regarding the Bank of China's future business, before the official establishment of the Central Reserve Bank, the bank will continue to share the responsibilities that the Central Reserve Bank should bear. However, according to the report, "Once this transition period is over, the functions of the leading banks will be more clearly defined, and each bank will be able to concentrate on the development of financial business within its own scope as stipulated in the regulations." We deeply know that the clear division of the functions of the leading banks is a necessary condition for consolidating China's financial foundation. However, we sincerely hope that what is said in the report can be realized as soon as possible.

### Japanese Finance Minister Declares He Does Not Hope for the Emergence of New Parties

But hopes that political parties can reform themselves. The Seiyukai's attitude towards the government hardens.

⊙Ujiyamada Finance Minister Yuki and Vice President of the Bank of Japan, Tsushima, visited the Ise Grand Shrine to report on their new appointments. They arrived at Ujiyamada Station at 9:00 AM on the 4th. During the stop in Ujiyamada, he said the following: ㊀ Regarding the election issue, the reason for dissolving the parliament this time is to demand the reform and reflection of political parties, not because of policy differences. Therefore, the government does not expect new parties to emerge to serve as its partner in the future. If the quality of the members elected in the general election improves, the parliament can be divided in any way. ㊁ Regarding the exchange rate issue, in order to prevent the exchange rate from deteriorating due to the inevitable increase in import surplus, we will continue to appropriately transport cash within the scope of new gold production to maintain the level of the exchange rate. Whether the import exchange permit system after July will be abolished remains to be seen and cannot be discussed now. In addition, exchange banks in the market also hope to revise the regulations, and there are many other business situations. All those who only seek self-interest must be rejected. For example, textile companies are developing in North China, but the exchange of their capital is said to be difficult due to the import permit system, and they request that the system be relaxed. This is because textile companies only aim at their own interests and have not yet been permitted. The Ministry of Finance and the Textile Federation are investigating this matter. (4th Allied Press)

[Tokyo] The Minseito Party has been holding election committees at its headquarters for several days to handle the selection of successor candidates and election countermeasures. What is particularly noteworthy recently is that the party's attitude towards the government is gradually hardening. Their claims are roughly as follows: Our party's attitude towards the government was originally lukewarm. Now that the government despises political parties and adopts an extremely unconstitutional attitude and unreasonable dissolution, we should of course declare war on the government under the banner of establishing constitutional government and purifying the political arena. However, we must coordinate with the Seiyukai beforehand, and if we can issue a joint statement, we should make the attitudes of the two parties towards the government clear. (4th Allied Press)

[London] "The Star" published an editorial tonight entitled "Japan at the Crossroads," which stated, "The Japanese military and political parties have been competing for supremacy for a long time. The dissolution of the House of Representatives and the holding of new elections have brought this political struggle into a new stage. After dissolving the House of Representatives, Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Senjūrō ordered the general election to be held at the end of this month, which shows that he is still wary and does not want to destroy the last remnants of the civil administration system." The newspaper continued, "A new political party has emerged in Japan, which openly declares that its purpose is to implement fascist politics. In short, whether the foundation of civil administration thinking is solid in Japan since the Meiji Restoration seventy years ago will be proven in this election."

### How to Curb the Soaring Prices in Japan

Governor of the Bank of Japan believes there are many ways.

[Tokyo] How to curb the soaring prices caused by the implementation of the large budget is the most important issue in Japan's financial economy. The central agency for implementing price countermeasures in the future is the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Ikeda Shigeaki. The governor spoke about the price issue on the 4th as follows: There are many ways to suppress high prices, but the ultimate solution is to expand productivity. In our country's current situation, this should be the best way. Increasing productivity and the abundant supply of materials will reduce doubts and suppress soaring prices. The example of Germany can also be understood. However, in order to expand productivity and supply industrial funds, prices will inevitably tend to soar during the transition period. This tendency is inevitable. We must consider how to deal with it. Regarding the supply of industrial funds, we must also consider the arrival of the reaction period and other various situations. It is also necessary to consider which businesses can be given funds. Under this meaning, there must be a need for control. (4th Allied Press)

### The Members of the US-Philippine Committee Have Been Appointed

[San Francisco] United States High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt departed from here today to take office in Manila. (3rd National Telegraph)

[New York] Philippine President Quezon delivered a speech at the Foreign Relations Research Society today, stating that the national defense of the Philippines can be made so strong that aggressors must suffer losses in life and property to the extent that they dare not try it lightly. Quezon absolutely denied that the Philippine national defense plan was designed to consolidate the authority of the United States in the Western Pacific. Quezon also said that he did not intend to use military procedures to militarize the Philippines, but only to create a peaceful army of the people, and that military training for young people would be modeled on that implemented in Switzerland, supplemented by a small number of technical units. Quezon further said that the increase in Philippine military preparations is in preparation for self-government. If it is said that it is intended to help the United States against Japan, it is not only baseless, but also has considerable malice. (3rd Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch)

### The United States Increases Wages by Approximately 17 Million Yuan Annually

Negotiations at General Motors are deadlocked. The strike at the Ford factory is resolved.

[New York] The wage agreement for US coal miners was concluded yesterday. Statistics show that the total annual wage increase nationwide is approximately 17 million yuan. The number of striking workers nationwide has also decreased significantly. It is found that approximately 462,000 coal miners were involved in the strike. Furthermore, the 1,400 sit-down strikers at the Ford assembly plant in Kansas City left the factory yesterday. According to a member of the strike committee, Ford authorities have agreed not to dismiss any workers and have sent five senior officials to fly from Detroit to Kansas City to investigate the strike situation. Previously, the total number of strikers in the automobile industry was approximately 130,000, but it is expected to decrease by the end of this week. 30,000 workers at General Motors will resume work at the weekend.

However, Chrysler and Lewis will meet again at 10:30 AM tomorrow, and Michigan Governor Murphy, who is engaged in mediation, is also optimistic. (3rd National Telegraph)

[New York] The strike at the Ford assembly plant in Kansas City has now been resolved. According to the union, the strike was caused by Ford's disregard for the rights of those who have served for a long time and discrimination against union workers. Therefore, five senior officials of the company have flown from Detroit to Kansas City to investigate the truth of the strike. (4th Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch)

[New York] The strike in the US automobile industry has not yet ended at this time. 60,000 workers at the Chrysler automobile plant in Detroit, Michigan, have been on strike for a month. Industrial Progress Association Chairman Lewis has now returned to Lansing from New York to hold negotiations with Chrysler factory owners in the hope of resolving the strike. Michigan Governor Murphy will also participate in these negotiations. In addition, the factory set up by General Motors in Flint City was occupied by striking workers. The factory accused the union of damaging the agreement signed with the company last month and criticized it. Therefore, the union leader in the city has ordered the striking workers to withdraw from the factory. In addition, a strike has also broken out at the Ford automobile factory. 14,000 workers at the Ford factory in Kansas City have stopped working entirely and occupied the factory until now because the factory dismissed 350 workers. As of now, the union has not ordered Ford factory workers to strike, but Automobile Union Chairman Martin has declared that Ford factory workers' wages are too low and working conditions need to be improved. In Washington, most members of Congress and senior administrative officials are now advocating a quick resolution to the strike.

### Southern Travel Jottings (4)

— Junbao

Many years ago, stone tools were discovered in the Hoa Binh region of Annam (present-day Vietnam), similar to those found in Siam (Thailand), Malaya, Java, and other islands in the South Seas. This is sufficient proof that in ancient times, the same ethnic group spread widely across Annam, Siam, Malaya, the South Seas islands, and New Guinea. The Dutch geology professor Callenfels discovered eleven human skulls from the Ice Age, 40,000 years ago, in central Java. He also unearthed human weapons and bones of cattle and seahorses at the same location. This discovery shook the world, and the South Seas islands became the focus of attention for anthropologists. The American Carnegie Corporation provided US$18,000 to the Raffles Museum in Singapore as a subsidy for the excavation of Malayan ethnic culture, designated for use from 1934 to 1936. The excavation of ancient Malayan ethnic skeletons began in 1924, led by Callenfels. He first excavated thousands-year-old human bones and ancient stone tools in the Province Wellesley of Penang, similar to those found in Hoa Binh, Annam. Last year, archaeologists from the Taiping Museum discovered several ancient human skeletons in the Sungei Siput rock shelter in Hoa Binh and obtained an even more ancient human skeleton in the Hoa Binh caves. After cleaning, the face, upper and lower jawbones, teeth, etc., became clearly visible. Archaeologists believe they belong to the Austronesian race (Malay race) who migrated here as early as 4,500 years ago, even earlier than the Stone Age. Currently, Callenfels' excavation work has been completed, and all the findings from various locations will be transported to the Singapore Museum for display. At the same time, a detailed report is being drafted and will be published soon. The Raffles Museum has specially opened a room to display the ancient cultural artifacts unearthed, providing resources for specialists to study. This ancient South Seas culture possesses a unique system, and those who study this culture have named it with a general term, "Hoa Binh culture," because this ancient culture was first discovered in the Hoa Binh region of Annam. Therefore, the origin of the Malay race will undoubtedly gain new evidence from this.

Since the beginning of the sixteenth century, people from Western countries came east by sea, opening up colonies. The Dutch, as well as people from England and France, followed one after another. They devoured and fragmented the entire South Seas islands, turning them all into colonies of the white race. Like tigers entering a flock of sheep, they chose the fattest to devour. From then on, the colored people of the East became like a lonely city under the setting sun, declining and disappearing, with little chance of survival. The Malay ethnic group was the first to bear the brunt.

Scholars who pride themselves on being civilized humans and are rich in traditional ideas regard the uncivilized or semi-civilized humans in various parts of the world as inferior races, not to be equated with civilized humans. The concept of human inequality is deeply rooted and unbreakable; this is merely a result of selfish and self-serving desires. Therefore, it is natural for so-called civilized humans to dominate barbaric humans, to oppress and slaughter them, and no one will criticize or interfere.

The reason why uncivilized or semi-civilized humans in the world remain in the primitive age and do not evolve is simply due to their living environment: such as harsh climates, which force people to exert themselves; obstructed transportation, preventing external stimulation; and simple living needs, easy to obtain, and a lack of intense competition.

The Malay race of the South Seas islands is by no means as inferior as expected by general scholars. After the invasion of foreign races, the environment has greatly changed, and the stimulation and influence they have received has been profound. The most significant stimulus is economic oppression. Several years ago, the Congress of the Malay Nationalist Party of Sumatra declared: The Dutch East Indies is the East Indies of the East Indians. After the Dutch invaded and occupied it, they imposed unequal treatment. Each coolie receives only eight guilders per year in wages, and the average daily living expense per person is only eight cents. Currently, due to the economic panic, it is only three cents per person. In any case, they must be independent and autonomous. Therefore, their progress is very rapid, advancing a thousand miles a day, and they are already contending with the world's cultured humans, raising their eyebrows and breathing freely.

Since the nineteenth century to the twentieth century, Eastern nations have begun to fight for equality with Western nations. The rise of the Japanese nation and the revolutionary advancement of the Chinese nation need not be mentioned. Even the independence and autonomy movement of the Malay nation has shone with unique brilliance. For example, the independence of the Philippines began in 1890 with resistance against the Spanish government and the American occupation of the Philippines. The Philippine national anti-American movement continued to struggle, and finally the independence of the Philippines was victorious. The Malays of the Dutch East Indies are following in the footsteps of the Philippines. The independence movement is also surging. The Dutch are using a dual approach of appeasement and coercion. Their ruling methods have also changed considerably. For example, in 1917, they established a people's assembly, and in 1925, they expanded the autonomy of the East Indies. Since then, Malays have also had representative figures appearing in the autonomous conference halls of the colonial government. However, the more progressive Malays are not satisfied with this kind of superficial appeasement. The continued demand for liberation has not diminished. The political parties they have organized have names such as the Indian Party, the Islamic Party, the Unity Party, the Nationalist Party, etc. When former Philippine President Quezon took office, Tan Malaka, the leader of the East Indies Unity Party, sent a congratulatory telegram, almost positioning himself as the Quezon of the East Indies. However, the Dutch treat radical political parties with no hesitation in using coercive measures to prevent them from existing, only then can they rest assured. Currently, the most troublesome thing for the Dutch East Indies government in politics is dealing with the Malay independence and autonomy movement. The dawn of the Malay nation is gradually brightening, and there will eventually be a time when it is in its zenith. The Malay nation is in the process of awakening, and the idea that the Malay nation is a nation that enjoys pleasure and does not make progress should be corrected.

### France Makes No Comments on the Little Entente

Czechoslovak President to Visit Southern Country

[Paris] Newspapers report that the Standing Political Council of the Little Entente countries rejected a proposal made by France regarding a mutual assistance pact between the Little Entente countries at a meeting held in the capital of Yugoslavia. Regarding this claim, diplomatic sources have clarified that the French Foreign Ministry has not submitted any specific proposal to the Little Entente meeting. In addition, Czechoslovak President Beneš is scheduled to visit the capital of Yugoslavia next Monday to consult with key figures of the country's government. The future situation of the Little Entente should be clarified at that time. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas dispatch)

⊙Romanian Capital: The semi-official newspaper Universul commented on the situation of the Standing Political Council of the Little Entente countries, which met in the capital of Yugoslavia yesterday, stating: "The Standing Political Council of these countries passed a principle at a meeting held in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, in September of last year, stipulating that these countries enjoy freedom of action in foreign affairs. This fact has created a big mistake, and Yugoslavia was therefore able to present the fact (referring to the political and economic agreement concluded between that country and Italy) before the current Standing Council."

### Poland Pays Attention to German-Soviet Relations

Situated Between Two Powers, Situation is Extremely Difficult

⊙Warsaw: Political figures here are paying close attention to the evolution of German-Soviet relations. Judging from the various psychological and economic signs recently, although the policies of Germany and the Soviet Union are currently incompatible and there is no room for compromise, it seems possible that they may change course and cooperate in the future. If this kind of cooperation is realized, Poland, situated between the two major powers, will inevitably feel fearful. This is especially unsettling for the Polish opposition. For example, the right-wing opposition newspaper Ateneum Weekly commented: "Germany's market for obtaining raw materials abroad is now only the Soviet Union. Germany wants to conquer the Soviet Union by force and seize its raw materials, which is currently difficult to do. Therefore, if Germany wants to obtain raw materials, it can only reach an understanding with the Soviet Union and promote trade between the two countries. Therefore, the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union will one day change their current state. Some may think that the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union are so bad that cooperation is impossible, but this is not the case. Past facts prove that Germany once regarded Poland as its number one enemy, but after the signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact in 1934, Germany declared Poland as its friend. So, how can we be sure that Germany and the Soviet Union cannot reconcile one day?" In addition, right-wing figures believe that there is a possibility of rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union from a psychological perspective. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas dispatch)

###沧州缉私案日方提抗议

向冀省府提出四项要求　私货自津南下形成停顿

Tianjin Communication, March 12th Morning, the Cangzhou security team killed two Koreans and wounded one while suppressing smuggling. The Japanese Consulate General in Tianjin sent personnel to collect evidence and take photos regarding the case. Initially, they intended to protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but after consulting with the Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, they received a reply stating that the case was a dishonorable matter and it would be difficult to formulate a protest letter.  It would be more appropriate to protest to the local authorities. After receiving the telegram, the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin studied it carefully and believed that protesting to the Cangxian government would be disrespectful because of its low rank, and they would not be an appropriate recipient of a protest.  Protesting to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was also deemed inappropriate because Cangxian was not under the council's direct jurisdiction.  Finally, at the end of March, they drafted a protest letter after careful consideration.  At 4:30 PM on the 1st of this month, Vice Consul Nishi Daichōkō was dispatched with the protest letter to visit Chen Dongsheng, the head of the Hebei Provincial Government's office in Tianjin, to deliver the letter and ask him to forward it to the provincial government.  On the morning of the 2nd, Nishi also took a copy of the protest to Beijing and delivered it to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council.  They were still unwilling to regard the Hebei Provincial Government as the sole party and bypass the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, lest we should underestimate the importance of the issue.  The main points of the protest are: ㊀ Severely punish the security team police who opened fire and killed people. ㊁ Replace Li Guojun, the magistrate of Cangxian, and the police chief of the county. ㊂ Provide generous compensation to the families of the dead and injured Koreans and compensate for the loss of goods. ㊃ Guarantee that such humiliating and anti-Japanese incidents will not occur again in the future. The original text concluded with a warning, urging the Hebei Provincial Government not to obscure the facts of the case, and warning that if such incidents were to occur again, the Japanese side would take decisive independent action. After receiving the protest, Chen Dongsheng telegraphed the provincial government to report the matter. The response of the provincial government will depend on Provincial Chairman Feng Zhi'an's instructions to Song Zheyuan. After the incident, the Cangxian government, in preparation for diplomatic procedures, took photos of the scene after the incident and voluntarily detained two security team police officers related to the case. When Onozaki, the Japanese police and judicial officer, went to Old Cangzhou to investigate on February 12th and 13th, County Magistrate Li Guojun argued with him based on the facts and kept a record of the conversation, which has been reported to the provincial government. The provincial government intends to have Chen Dongsheng negotiate locally in Tianjin if the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has no direct responsibility for negotiation, and to consult with Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong at any time in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Since the Cangxian incident, the smuggling of Ronin from Tianjin to the south has gradually come to an end. At the same time, the General Inspectorate of the Customs Road Transportation Anti-Smuggling Office has jointly suppressed and searched unscrupulous merchants inside and outside the city, and the market for smuggled goods is on the verge of decline. There are many smuggled goods piled up in Tianjin, and sales have been cut off, causing great panic among the Ronin. Therefore, they urgently hope that the Japanese government will use this dispute to expand the problem itself, making it serious, so that we will feel the suppression is difficult and abandon the current plan, so that the smuggling trend can be revived. Therefore, the resolution of this case is quite difficult.

One day early, a smuggling Ronin from the Japanese Concession in Tianjin loaded a heavy truck with 200 bags of smuggled sugar and transported it south along the Jinpu Road. When it arrived in Dezhou, it was intercepted by the Road Transportation Anti-Smuggling Office personnel. The Ronin showed the Jin Customs transportation certificate filled in for transportation to Henan, indicating that it had obtained permission from the Tianjin Customs, and relying on his barbarity, he tried to force his way through. After the inspector pointed out that the transportation direction was incorrect and that he was suspected of smuggling, he was detained. The Ronin then rushed back to Tianjin on the morning of the 2nd to report to the Japanese Consulate. The consulate believed that this was the customs deliberately making things difficult for legitimate Japanese merchants, and was preparing to protest to the customs within days. (Evening of the 2nd)

### 闽省府召集地方财政会议

积极建设地方事业　筹措资源整理税收

Fuzhou Communication, Before the end of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, local unrest and chaos in Fujian province multiplied, and the local finances of various counties were chaotic, complex, and unverifiable. After the Fujian Incident was quelled, Chen Yi was ordered to preside over Fujian, and he urgently sought to reform all aspects of government, especially financial reform, which was a matter of utmost urgency. It is said that after the chaos, the people need rest and recuperation before they can talk about production. Without increased production, there is no way to enrich the tax base. Therefore, in the face of extremely difficult financial conditions, efforts were made to reorganize. Last year, more than 520 kinds of harsh and miscellaneous taxes were abolished, totaling more than 5 million yuan. Fourteen counties were exempted from land tax, totaling more than 2 million yuan. Other taxes such as tea, wood, paper, bamboo shoots, etc. were also repeatedly reduced. This year, the Xiamen fruit business tax was abolished, the Putian-Xianyou bamboo and wood tax was exempted, and the Zhangzhou export rice tax was abolished. At the same time, in order to accumulate and rectify the collection methods and eliminate long-standing abuses, revenue collection offices were set up in various counties to abolish redundant agencies. All provincial and county local taxes are collected together, and county treasuries are set up to exclusively manage provincial and county public funds and accounting affairs, so as to unify the revenue and expenditure of provincial and county funds, implement a new accounting system, formulate local accounting regulations in the province, seek to promote accounting independence, and establish a special business tax consolidation office to consolidate special business taxes. In Fujian Province, special business taxes, such as bamboo, wood, paper, bamboo shoots, oil, sugar, tea, seafood, wax, fertilizer, fruit, etc., are a major source of provincial revenue. In the past, due to shortfalls in treasury revenue, it was necessary to use contracted merchants to pay taxes in advance to subsidize the treasury. However, the contracting system had many abuses, and its complex organization and diverse names were generally criticized. Every additional collection agency means more harassment for merchants and the people. The provincial government is well aware of this situation and has gradually changed contracting to consignment. Those whose contract period has expired are generally ordered to be merged into various special business tax bureaus and tax bureaus for collection, and no longer recruit merchants to contract. After this reorganization of Fujian's finances, monthly revenue has gradually increased. According to the Finance Department's report, the total revenue in July of the 25th year of the Republic of China was more than 444,000 yuan, 533,000 yuan in August, 633,000 yuan in September, 899,000 yuan in October, 773,000 yuan in November, and more than 1.04 million yuan in December (of which 60,000 yuan was an advance payment, so the actual total revenue was more than 978,000 yuan). The largest progress in each month was special business tax, followed by slaughter tax and brokerage tax. However, land tax revenue has not increased. The expenditures in each month have also gradually increased. In the December 25th expenditure, debt repayment and interest payment alone reached more than 550,000 yuan, and the revenue and expenditure were still insufficient.

Chairman Chen has designated this year as the year of economic construction in Fujian Province. Local construction projects are being actively promoted. Therefore, raising resources, consolidating local taxes, and increasing tax revenue are the primary goals. It was decided to convene a local financial conference in the province on April 6, attended by ㊀ the Director, Secretary, Section Chief, and Director of the Finance Department, ㊁ the Director of the Finance Bureau of the Municipal Government and the Finance Section Chiefs of each county, ㊂ the heads of various tax agencies, and ㊃ experts designated by the chairman. The Finance Department Director will serve as the chairman. The scope of discussion is limited to the proposals submitted by the Provincial Chairman, the Finance Department Director, and the Finance Section Chiefs of each city and county. The attendees from each city, county, and tax agency must submit a financial report to the Finance Department Secretariat seven days before the meeting. As the conference date approaches, all counties have successively prepared reports and proposals on their opinions on tax administration and the difficulties encountered and sent them to the province. The General Assembly Office has also been organized, with three groups: General Affairs, Procedures, and Editing, headed by Mao Yiheng, Yan Zhichao, and others. All matters resolved at this meeting will be selected and approved by the Finance Department Director for implementation by the Provincial Government.

The petition of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grains Associations of this city to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan stated: We note that Guangdong Province requested tax exemption for imported foreign rice, initially citing the high price and shortage of rice, and then worrying about the off-season. To sum up, the reasons are nothing more than these. Whether to approve the tax exemption should be determined by whether domestic rice can meet its needs. According to the Ministry of Finance's careful instructions in December of last year in response to Guangdong Province's request, the agricultural harvests in Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces were abundant and had surplus grain that could meet Guangdong Province's needs. Guangdong Province should purchase domestic rice as much as possible to provide relief and adjust the surplus and deficiency, which can be said to be fair and appropriate. Therefore, there is no need to discuss whether Guangdong Province should be exempted from import tax on foreign rice. Afterwards, Guangdong Province still insisted on the request, and the government accommodated its intention, allowing the import of 1.3 million dan of rice at half tax on account, and the Yuehan Railway increased special trains to transport Xiang rice. The Grain Transportation and Marketing Bureau specially hired special ships to transport Wan rice. The government's overall planning for the people's food in Guangdong Province has been all-encompassing. According to the survey report of the Transportation and Marketing Bureau, the so-called rice shortage in Guangdong Province has become a thing of the past. Recently, various producing areas have taken advantage of the abundant harvest last autumn and have carried out a large number of shipments of edible rice to South China. According to estimates by rice merchants in Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces, there are still more than 2 million shi of surplus rice in each of these provinces, which is currently waiting to be transported to Guangdong. According to the "General Situation of National Industry in the 25th Year" compiled and printed by the Statistics Office of the Ministry of Industry last month, the output of indica and japonica rice this year was 859,601,000 dan, an increase of 25,064,000 dan compared to previous years. From this, we know the wealth of surplus rice stored, and it is more credible than the estimates of rice merchants. Moreover, the harvest period in Guangdong Province is earlier than in other provinces. The early rice harvest in Xiang rice is also no later than March. With such cooperation between officials and merchants, how can the people's food in the province not be supplied? We were expecting domestic rice to sell well in Guangdong, and farmers and merchants could benefit from both sides. Unexpectedly, according to reports, starting from April 1, 4 million dan of foreign rice were allowed to be transported to Guangdong tax-free. Earlier, the governments of Hunan and Hubei provinces, upon hearing this news, telegraphed the central government one after another to stop it. It is true that this move will block the throat of domestic rice sales and add wings to the dumping of foreign rice, which will not only increase imports but also violate economic principles. Considering the national economy and the people's livelihood, there is nothing that is feasible. Even if Guangdong does not take this into account, your Excellency should take the overall situation into consideration and coordinate the situation. We propose that the relevant departments be instructed to meet with the leaders of the four provinces of Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei as soon as possible to conduct an accurate survey of the surplus rice in each of these provinces. If the estimates of the rice merchants are not false, then the order for tax exemption for imported foreign rice in Guangdong Province should be immediately revoked, and the rice merchants in the rice-producing provinces should be instructed to rush the rice to Guangdong as much as possible at the same price as foreign rice, so as to avoid the worry of the off-season. Only in this way can it be fair and appropriate, and the rice-producing provinces and the merchants and people of Guangdong Province will be convinced. Now we recommend representatives to respectfully visit your Ministry to petition, and we humbly request your approval and implementation. Presented by Wang, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, Wu, the Minister of Industry, and Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

### One Million Stones of Jiangxi and Hunan Rice Begin Loading in Shanghai

Representatives of Jiangxi Rice Industry Personally Negotiate Transportation

Last year, Hunan had a bumper harvest of rice, but the Xiang River was low, and transportation was impossible. For half a year, a large amount of Hunan rice was stockpiled and waiting to be transported. Recently, the Xiang River has risen sharply, and the shallowest point has exceeded eleven feet. Large river steamers can directly reach Changsha. On April 1, the Six Companies issued the third announcement on shallow water fees for the Hankou-Changsha section, and all fees were cancelled (i.e., the final 25%). The rice that had been stuck in Hunan was frantically wired to the Six Companies in Shanghai, requesting that a large number of river steamers be sent to Changsha as soon as possible to transport the rice to Shanghai. The most urgent rice to be loaded now is about one million stones in Changsha. The Six Companies have sent river steamers directly to Changsha to compete for the transport of this large amount of rice to the east. In addition to dispatching the "Ming" series of four ships, the Sanbei Company has also transferred the Long'an to Hunan to transport the rice. It is expected that the first batch can be imported within ten days. In addition, Jiangxi has also stockpiled 500,000 to 600,000 stones of rice waiting to be transported to Shanghai. In recent days, grain merchants have been urging the loading very urgently. Shen Huating, director of the China Merchants Bureau in Jiujiang, along with representatives from the Jiangxi rice industry, personally came to Shanghai to negotiate with the head office to add special-purpose steamers for transporting rice to supply the transportation. The negotiations were successful yesterday, and the representatives of the Jiangxi rice industry took the steamer back to Jiangxi that evening to prepare for loading.

### Special Commissioners Lu Bohong and Others Go to Kaifeng, Henan Province, to Distribute Disaster Relief

Received 320,000 Yuan in Relief Funds

The drought in Henan Province is extremely severe. Special commissioners came to Shanghai to appeal for help. Various charitable organizations jointly formed a United Relief Association and have already remitted 320,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. Chang Zhizhen, the acting chairman of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, came to Shanghai a few days ago to thank all parties and accompanied the disaster relief committee members Lu Bohong and others to leave Shanghai last night for Henan to distribute the relief funds. The details are recorded below:

Chang's Departure from Shanghai

After the establishment of the United Relief Association of various charitable organizations in Shanghai, representatives Lu Bohong, Mu Ouchu, and Zhu Ziqiao were sent to investigate. They returned to the association and reported that the disaster in the province was extremely severe, famine was widespread, and people were crying for food. Therefore, the various organizations immediately advanced 320,000 yuan and remitted it to the Henan Provincial Relief Committee for emergency relief. Chang Zhizhen, the acting chairman of the committee, came to Shanghai a few days ago to thank all sectors and accompanied the disaster relief committee members Lu Bohong, Li Shaoduo, Bi Yuncheng, and many staff members to leave Shanghai last night via Nanjing. They will join Guo Fangwu, the director of the Xindu Orphanage in Henan Province who is in Nanjing, and travel together to Kaifeng to negotiate with the Henan Provincial Government and the Relief Committee to determine the method of distributing the relief funds. Last night, fellow Henan provincials living in Shanghai went to the station to see them off.

Distribution of Relief Funds

A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Chang at his lodging. According to him, the relief funds received totaled 320,000 yuan from various charitable organizations, including 120,000 yuan for work relief and 200,000 yuan for emergency relief. Some charitable organizations have already automatically remitted funds for disaster relief. Although the amount may still be insufficient, he is very grateful for the enthusiasm of all parties. As for the provincial government, it has also raised 850,000 yuan, with 300,000 yuan for emergency relief and the remaining funds for work relief. The four highways of Luoye, Luogong, Luomeng, Yandeng have been designated for paving the road surface, and work has already begun. The strong men along the road can be accommodated, and wages of 20 cents will be paid for each job. Other projects will be launched in order as needed. If the funds are insufficient, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to provide subsidies. As for emergency relief matters, a disaster relief office has been specially set up to assign personnel to go to the countryside to distribute relief. Chen Bohong will return to Shanghai first, and the remaining personnel will stay in the province to supervise the distribution.

Tragic Situation of Disaster Victims

Chang Father discussed the tragic situation of the disaster victims in various places in the province. According to him, less than two or three out of a hundred households in a village can afford to eat rice, and less than eight or nine can grind tree bark and bran into flour to make a paste to feed themselves. The rest have exhausted their rice and flour, and their houses are empty. Everywhere you look, people are digging soil and stones underground to fill their hunger. The situation is so tragic that it is unimaginable. Therefore, they cry all day long and are on the verge of death. Emergency relief cannot be delayed. There are now more than 1,500 tons of miscellaneous grains stored in Beiping. If there are relief funds, they can be purchased and distributed. Chang then showed various samples collected from various places, such as grain bran flour and stone flour, and urged wide publicity. So far this year, the area along the Longhai Railway in the province is still suffering from drought and no rain, and spring plowing has not been able to enter the soil. The suffering in the future will be even greater than today. This is a major crisis, he said.

### National Products Joint Venture Company to Hold Shareholders' Founding Meeting on the 10th

Most Shares Subscribed from Shanghai

The China National Products United Business Company has been scheduled to hold a shareholders' founding meeting on the 10th of this month in the Industry Department in Nanjing. The preparatory work has been arranged. A meeting was held in Shanghai a few days ago to report on various points: 1. The first phase of capital is one million, one-third of which is subscribed by the Ministry of Industry, and the remainder is publicly raised. 700,000 yuan has been raised, exceeding the original quota of two-thirds. The Ministry has agreed to transfer it from the official shares. Most shares are subscribed from Shanghai, accounting for about 600,000 yuan. There are three places in Guangxi that each subscribe for 10,000 yuan, and the rest are subscribed by Hankou and other places. The share payment is collected by the Bank of China in Shanghai and has expired. However, there are still a few that have not been paid in full. Special accommodation will be made until the 5th of this month, and no more will be accepted after the deadline. 2. The cooperation with various domestic goods companies and shops has drafted a plan, which will be discussed and handled after the board of directors is established. The cooperation method is roughly that the joint venture company invests in various domestic goods companies and shops to expand, and the various companies and shops also subscribe for shares in the joint venture company. The amount of investment must be based on the assets, liabilities, and business conditions of each company and shop. The Joint Office of Domestic Goods Companies will assist in the accounting of assets. 3. The head office will be established in Shanghai, and three houses have been found and reported to the board of directors for decision. 4. Various rules and regulations have also been drafted and submitted to the shareholders' meeting for amendment and approval. It is said that the company has 17 directors, 5 official shares selected by the Ministry of Industry, and 12 commercial shares selected at the shareholders' meeting.

### Jisheng Association Investigates the Tragic Situation of the Henan Disaster

The China Jisheng Association and the Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Association jointly organized the Henan Relief and jointly recommended Feng Junwei Yangshan and Zheng Juncan Shouchang to go to Henan to investigate the disaster. Now, a letter has been received from Feng from the disaster area, stating that the situation in the ten counties in western Henan is more serious than in other places. There has been no rain since June last year, the ground is cracked, the villages are desolate, people are displaced, and the corpses of the starving are everywhere. The thin and weak bodies stagger and fall to their deaths, which is unbearable to hear. Recently, the tree bark and grass roots that have been eaten are exhausted, and mountain stones are ground into flour to fill hunger. It is difficult to digest and has no nourishment. Eating it causes abdominal distension and constipation, and death soon follows. Dengfeng in western Henan is the most tragic area. The association has recognized the relief in Dengfeng. It is said that there are more than 240,000 disaster victims in the county. This spring, apart from those who have died and have not returned, there are now more than 60,000 very poor people, about 100,000 or more poor people. There is an increasing number of poor people. A drop in the bucket is impossible to save. Please report the situation and ask the Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Association to increase the amount of relief. The association has discussed and tried to increase the relief funds with the Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Association and invited several relief friends to take a car to Henan last night to transfer to Dengfeng from Yanshi to investigate and release the funds. However, the disaster is severe and the funds are meager. If they are not rescued, they will not survive. Good people, save this remnant and hope for it.

### All Overseas Chinese in Paris Contribute Opinions on Participating in the Exposition

It was recently learned from a visit to the office of the delegation participating in the Paris International Exposition that all overseas Chinese in Paris sent an important letter to the association, stating the significance of holding the exposition and the preparations that should be made for participation. The letter was very detailed. The following is a copy of the letter:

The "International Exposition of Modern Living Arts and Technology" to be held in Paris from May to October this year is a grand international movement to promote modern social civilization and material progress. It is of great importance to the development of the future of nations and countries. Therefore, countries around the world are enthusiastically participating, with the number now exceeding fifty. Among the countries that stand in this modern era, only China has not participated. Recently, the opening date of the exposition is approaching, and the construction of the venue is almost complete. News has come from the motherland that academic groups have jointly initiated participation with the Shanghai business community. This is a very good phenomenon. All overseas Chinese are very happy to hear about it. However, due to the vast distance between the country and overseas, the people of the country may not be fully aware of the actual situation of this exposition. Therefore, we are providing a brief overview: "A" The significance of holding this exposition. According to the association's charter, the greatest significance of holding the exposition lies in stimulating modern production capacity, exchanging ideas and emotions between nations, and conveying the unique characteristics of their countries, thereby promoting international culture in the twentieth century. "B" The standard program for this exposition and the necessary preparations for China's participation. The program for exhibits as stipulated by the association can be summarized into the following twelve items: ㊀ Performances of artistic movements. ㊁ Inventions of industrial technology. ㊂ Educational systems and their structures at all levels. ㊃ Facilities for art and technical education. ㊄ Social life phenomena and their education. ㊅ Family education. ㊆ Modern construction of cities and villages. ㊇ Daily necessities and decorations. ㊈ Plastic arts. ㊉ Printing and publishing. ㊉㊀ Transportation. ㊉㊁ Customs and etiquette. The items listed above are all closely related to human life and are more educational in nature. They should be expressed in various ways and cannot be represented by a portion of exhibits. For China's participation this time, the following preparations should be made: ㊀ Regarding exhibits, new-style charts and on-site photographs with a consistent system should be created based on the aforementioned standard program, so as to represent the new spirit, new construction, new education, and new life of the entire Chinese nation and national revolution, thereby dispelling foreigners' contemptuous and evil views of Chinese society. ㊁ Regarding dynamic performances, the most valuable and representative films and dramas of the era in China should be gathered to perform at the exposition. At the same time, famous domestic scholars should be invited to the exposition to give long-term lectures on promoting the inherent national spirit of China, thereby promoting China's inherent national spirit. ㊂ Regarding printing and written publicity, a national construction plan for the entire country should be compiled, focusing on photographic illustrations, including social life, construction projects, education, health, academic inventions, etc., with explanations in English and French, so that foreigners can understand the true social phenomena of China and know how to respect it. Furthermore, the living conditions of farmers in the lost northeastern provinces and the current situation of the volunteer army should also be promoted as much as possible. "C" Even if China cannot formally participate, work should still be actively carried out. This exposition is a major international movement to promote modernity and also a good opportunity for international publicity. Our country is an ancient country with four thousand years of culture and should naturally have something to show. In today's time of national crisis, we must do our best to arouse international sympathy. Therefore, we believe that at least we should: ㊀ Print and distribute publications for publicity, including the aforementioned national construction plan and a collection of photographs of Chinese social life, with many photographs and illustrations, accompanied by famous Chinese works of art, to be distributed to various sectors at the conference. At the same time, rent a space in the public areas of the venue as a distribution point for this publicity. ㊁ Hold a Chinese art exhibition. One of the major significance of holding this exposition lies in the preservation of permanent modern art after the exposition. This new museum is large in scale. In the future, carefully selected works of art from various countries will be exhibited in it. Recently, a national art exhibition was held in China. If good works can be collected after the exhibition and transported to Paris for exhibition, it can not only promote China's unique Oriental art but also find ways to include our country's art exhibition works in the modern art museum to compensate for the failure to formally participate. It is indeed a win-win situation. It is heard that the delegation office has fully adopted the above opinions, and many of the points have already been handled, such as printing publicity materials. The points that have not been handled have been sent to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Communications, the Railway Department, the National Economic Commission, the Construction Committee, and the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters for assistance.

### Qingming Ancestor Worship Breaking Superstition

The Shanghai County Government believes that every Qingming Festival, the people mostly indulge in feasting, wasting money, and burning ingots, which are superstitious acts. Therefore, it has repeatedly issued notices to persuade the abolition of these practices. It is now learned that during this year's Qingming Festival, the gentry and scholars in the county mostly followed the ancestor worship methods of the Shuxiang Improvement Association, abolishing feasting and burning ingots, only offering incense, flowers, and fresh produce. The head of the family led the family members to pay respects in order, and then the head of the family was invited to describe the virtues of the ancestors to commemorate them.

### Monstrous Fetus Corpse Found on Jiaole Road

In front of No. 200 Jiaole Road (near the intersection of Lafayette Road) in the French Concession, under the street edge, at eight o'clock yesterday morning, an abandoned rush bag was found, containing the corpse of a male infant who had just been born and died. The inspectors examined the corpse and found it to be a monster fetus. The head and body were the same as ordinary infants who die immediately after birth. The only difference was that a reproductive organ grew in the center of the forehead, with a stem about five minutes long. Both eyes were merged into one eye socket, with no nasal bridge or passage. The mouth was smaller than usual, and the ears were similar to monkey ears. The umbilical cord was connected to the placenta without being cut. For a time, it attracted curious onlookers to speculate. It seemed that the family was frightened after the birth and suffocated the child to death before abandoning the corpse. The inspector reported to the French Police Department, which sent detectives to investigate and notified the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall to order a coffin for burial.

### Ciyou Association Maid Training Institute Officially Established to Shelter Maids

Attached to Lafayette Road Ciyou Training Institute, now housing and educating over twenty people.

The China Ciyou Association, recognizing the urgency of the problem of liberating maids, has specially established a maid training institute to take in homeless and abused maids who have been rescued through various means, so that they can live independently in the future. It has now been formally established, attached to the association's Ciyou Training Institute on Lafayette Road. According to Chen Tiesheng, the vice president of the association, the establishment of the maid training institute is to rescue maids. It has now taken in over twenty people, two-thirds of whom were sent by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the rest were mostly rescued by the institute. The original plan included instruction in household work and childcare. However, those who have been taken in are all under the age of fifteen. Due to their young age, primary school-level books are temporarily used as the teaching standard. All clothing, food, medicine, and other items are provided by the institute.

Brief Comments

### Textbook Price Reduction Issue

— Xing An

The issue of textbook price reduction is worth discussing. Because this issue is related to the popularization of education, it is very important and cannot be ignored. The Ministry of Education previously ordered various bookstores to review and reduce the prices of textbooks. The Book Industry Association stated that due to rising paper and raw material costs, they could not comply. Regarding this matter, the Municipal Education Association recently listed the reasons why textbook prices should be reduced and appealed to various bookstores to implement price reductions. The next day, the Book Industry Association again stated the reasons why prices could not be reduced and responded to the points raised by the Education Association. From this, it is clear that the book industry is unwilling to reduce textbook prices.

Textbook prices should be sold at the lowest possible price. The reasons for this are simple: First, textbooks are a tool for popularizing education. If they are not sold at a low price, they cannot be popularized. Second, textbook prices must be low to reduce students' education costs and make it easier for ordinary people to attend school. Third, textbook sales are very large, and selling them at a low price can still yield substantial profits. Fourth, the book industry has a mission to promote education. For textbooks, they should be especially self-restrained.

However, textbooks are often regarded as "rare goods" in the book industry. This can be seen by looking at the competition among various bookstores to publish textbooks and the past competitive situation. The Ministry of Education ordered various bookstores to review and reduce textbook prices. This is a very good move. If various bookstores can consider the future of education in our country, they should comply immediately. However, the Book Industry Association's unwillingness to implement price reductions on the grounds of rising paper and raw material costs is disappointing.

Whether textbook prices can be reduced depends on the cost. The cost of textbooks is not something outsiders can understand. According to the calculations of the Municipal Education Association, the cost of World Elementary School Chinese Language Textbook Volume 3 is only 1.8 cents, and the cost of Commercial Press Elementary School Chinese Language Textbook Volume 3 is only 12.7 cents. The former is priced at 6 cents, and the latter is priced at 90 cents, which shows that the profit is quite high. Even according to the book industry, this is only a part of the cost, and there are other expenses. Now, assuming that the cost of the former is 3 cents and the cost of the latter is 30 cents, the difference from the selling price is still far, and further reducing it should be possible.

"The association believes that fellow members must first seek to maintain their survival before they can contribute to education." This is naturally correct. No one is willing to sacrifice their capital to promote textbooks. However, on the other hand, it is also inappropriate to focus entirely on textbooks. What attitude do various bookstores have when publishing textbooks? Is it more about serving education or more about making money?

Therefore, regarding the textbook price reduction issue, it is hoped that the book industry can reduce prices somewhat under the principle of not losing money. This may have some impact on various bookstores. However, it will greatly benefit the popularization of education. Even setting aside the big picture, in recent years, the burden of education expenses for children in ordinary student families is extremely heavy. If various bookstores can review and reduce textbook prices, this will be a great benefit to those seeking education.

### Notes on Returning to My Hometown

— Liu Ziming

On the second day of returning to my hometown, relatives from near and far came to my house. They all seemed very happy that I returned to my hometown around Qingming every year. In my hometown, tomb sweeping is considered the most important thing. I am an only child, and after my parents died, I became a lone wanderer. However, I probably don't even understand the reason why I have to go back around Qingming every year. Does a young man who wanders outside all year long naturally yearn for home? But why must I go back at this time? To win the happiness of those relatives? Of course not, but who is urging me: "You have to go back!" In fact, spring in my hometown is no longer the time when warblers are flying around.

My uncle told me: The tomb keeper said last year that the bamboo fence on the ancestral tomb has become a den for stray dogs, and the planted pines and cypresses have been chopped down by children on fishing boats to be used as firewood... Although he did not say that he wanted me to go and take a look at the tomb immediately, that is something that descendants should do. I thanked him for his kindness and went to the tomb by boat the next day.

The boatman used to be a long-term worker in my family. Now he rents a Mátó boat and lives on the water. His home is the boat, and the boat is his home. Qingming is the busiest time of the year. He hired another helper. It is said that he can maintain his simple life by relying on the business of one spring. The boat left Chihe and encountered a favorable wind. So he raised the sails and let the helper steer the rudder at the stern. He crawled into the cabin to chat with me.

He was still like he was when he was a long-term worker in my family. He liked to drink and tell jokes. It's just that his forehead was covered with wrinkles from life, his temples were dyed with pale short hair, and perhaps his figure had become a little thinner than before. Climbing into the cabin, he first laughed. That kind of inexplicable goodwill could only be repaid with a smile after putting down my books and newspapers. He estimated the weight of the boat and sat down opposite me with a plop. He wiped his thick lips with the back of his big hand, and then took out a small wine bottle from his waist bag. He uncorked the bottle, tilted his head and took two sips, and then wiped his lips with the back of his hand before saying, "Aguan, do you still remember scolding me for being a drunkard?"

When I was a child, I often pestered him to tell stories, but the pungent smell of alcohol was really hard to bear. The other children often scolded him for being a drunkard too. Now I can only smile at him because I know that his wife was lost to drinking. Mentioning alcohol might evoke the honest man's sorrow. But he said it himself:

"Aguan, I'm afraid only I, A'er, have lost a wife to drinking. I don't know which unlucky ghost that stinky woman is selling herself to now. Aguan, do you remember? It was the little maid from Master Yang's house."

I nodded. When he got his hands on that little maid, he also took a shortcut. Master Yang gave her to A'er in a muddle-headed way to avoid trouble, but in the end, it came to nothing.

"Are you living alone now?" I asked him, "I'm afraid there are no more little maids in Master Yang's house."

"Aguan, don't make fun of me." He took a sip of wine, wiped his lips with the back of his hand, as if that action was inseparable. "Isn't it much easier to live alone? A wife is simply a shackle, tying you down and preventing you from taking a step. Once you take a step away, she flies away..."

He shook his head, drank wine again, and wiped his lips. Perhaps he had more complaints that he couldn't express in words. And I, the Aguan who used to sit on his lap and peel edamame pods, was so speechless to him now.

Traveling with the wind, we arrived in just half the time. When docking, A'er crawled out of the cabin to take in the sails. After the boat docked, he was the first to jump up and tie the cable, and then shouted loudly to the old man who kept the tomb in the tomb house. From the cabin, I couldn't even recognize which one was my family's tomb. I remember when my grandfather was buried, there was a shed built on the road from the shore to the tomb, the tomb was covered with fresh soil, and the surrounding pines and cypresses covered it like big umbrellas. It was a good feng shui that Master Kan had found. The old man came out of the tomb house. Looking at his staggering appearance, wasn't he just as unsuccessful as we were in fighting the children on fishing boats and fighting life?

### Sai Jinhua (12)

— Chen Hezuo

The agitation of the Boxers finally angered the imperialists. In the eyes of the great powers, China was the best "colony." How could their flames of aggression be extinguished? They united the armies of eight countries and wantonly slaughtered in China!

The old man sighed to me that he was too useless, and bowed his head apologetically. I comforted him instead, gave him a little more money, and told him to fix the bamboo fence properly. I don't want to use feng shui to give me any help, but if the tombs of my ancestors become dens for stray dogs, I will not be at peace.

A'er probably drank too much wine and talked to the old man in the loudest voice: "Aguan will make a fortune in the future and build a big tomb house. The ancestors are lucky, and you old man will also share the glory."

I wanted to ask if he was thinking about his runaway wife again? A middle-aged man would not fail to think about his future home. His wife ran away, and naturally he didn't have a son yet. Drunken words reveal the true heart. Was the old man's grief even greater than mine? The words came to my lips, but I swallowed them in the end. I asked him to hurry back and treat him to a catty of baigan in town.

### Talking About Foreign Superstitions

— Te

We often hear people say: "Today, science is flourishing, and all superstitions should be overthrown." Others say: "The Chinese are the most superstitious." In fact, while the Chinese are indeed superstitious, foreigners are no less superstitious. Walking under a ladder leaning against a wall is considered bad luck by foreigners. The famous scientist Albert Einstein once preferred to wade through water rather than walk under a ladder, which shows that science is sometimes no match for superstition.

There are many types of superstition. One is believing in the good or bad omens of future events. Many Chinese and foreigners believe that dream omens are very accurate. Now, let's talk about one or two foreign dream interpretations: If you dream of having a tooth pulled out and bleeding a lot, it is a bad omen. You must guard against relatives becoming ill, or even dying. Dreaming of losing something on your body and bleeding a lot is also a bad omen. If you have a tooth pulled out without blood, although it is not auspicious, it has nothing to do with your relatives. However, you must guard against minor misfortunes, but you don't have to worry too much. Dreaming of the dead has many implications. If the dead person is walking with a living person, be prepared to encounter a funeral. If the dead person gives some food or something else to a living person, the recipient will encounter auspicious events. If you dream of the dead giving you something while you are sick, it is a sign that you will recover soon. Some people who are not deeply superstitious also believe that dreams are a prediction of future events. They say that dreams are the brain's subconscious activity while asleep. Future events can indeed be projected in the brain in advance, but fools cannot perceive it for a while.

Some small things that happen occasionally can also be taken as a kind of prediction. If you accidentally spill salt on the table while eating, the people at the table will definitely be unhappy because it is a sign of arguments. If two engaged people are walking together on a rainy day and encounter a car driving by that splashes mud all over their bodies, ordinary people will definitely scold the driver. However, future couples who encounter this kind of thing do not feel sorry for their clothes being dirtied. They are also happy because it is a sign of sharing weal and woe and being united until old age. If a future couple is walking on the road and has to cross the road, and there happens to be a tree in front of them, and one walks past the left side of the tree and the other walks past the right side of the tree, that is something to be avoided. They should quickly shrink back and walk on the same side, otherwise, I am afraid that good things will be delayed and the mandarin ducks will be separated soon.

Female school students also have many superstitions. If two people say the same thing at the same time, that is an excellent opportunity. Quickly wrap your little fingers together and wish for what you desire in your heart, and you can be sure that your wish will soon be fulfilled. If young ladies are moved by their own marriage, they can borrow an engagement ring from their engaged friend and put it on the finger on which they wear an engagement ring for a minute or two. During this time, turn the ring three times and silently wish for what you desire in your heart. Then, you can be sure that within three months, your marriage will be a coincidence and you will find a lifelong companion. Or, on a clear night when the new moon rises, silently wish to the moon. Although the moon itself is a virgin and has nothing to do with the opposite sex, she is very willing to help people achieve good things and make you achieve your wishes.

Talking about superstition can definitely not be exhausted in a short article. The older the era, the more superstitions there are. China is originally an ancient country, so naturally there are superstitions everywhere. However, before the twentieth century, if you talked about superstition, everyone believed it and was not ashamed. Today, people who think they are more knowledgeable than old women will denounce it as stubborn.

However, there is one thing to never forget. Shakespeare said in his collection that if Roman Emperor Caesar had listened to his wife's warning on the night he was assassinated, perhaps he would not have suffered that disaster. Wasn't Caesar a very decisive husband? He laughed at his wife's superstition, but what was the result? (Translated from the English "Great American Evening News")
