### The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry Have Submitted a Report to the Executive Yuan Regarding the Case of Tax-Exempt Transportation of Foreign Rice to Guangdong

### Legislative Yuan Committee Members Debate the Increase and Decrease Budget

[Nanjing] When the Legislative Yuan reviewed the first case on the 23rd, Chen Changheng of the Finance Committee first reported on the content of the case and the review process. Then, Luo Ding raised questions to the Finance Committee. Luo said that it is permissible to add a budget after the end of the year to supplement revenue and expenditure in accordance with precedents and the newly revised regulations of the Budget Law on adding a budget. However, reducing the budget falls within the scope of the final accounts. After the end of the year, instead of expediting the final accounts, a reduced budget is handled, abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. Does this hinder the spirit of the budget system? He asked the Finance Committee to explain. Chen Changheng replied that there are two items in the reduction in this case: one is the reduction of more than 390,000 yuan in tobacco and alcohol tax in revenue, and the other is the reduction of more than 3.74 million yuan in debt expenses in expenditure. The two offset each other, resulting in a decrease in expenditure, which is a good phenomenon in finance. However, the current budget system has not yet been brought into order, and the preparation of final accounts is very late. In order to show the truth of the country's finances, the parts that should be reduced in the budget are reduced to avoid a large difference between the final accounts and the budget in the future. Afterwards, the two committees, Luo and Chen, continued to debate, but the result was still to add and reduce the budget according to the case. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### The Significance of Amending the Two National Assembly Laws

[Nanjing] The date of the National Assembly was previously resolved by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be postponed to November 12 of this year. Since the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law were not perfect, the Central Standing Committee was specially authorized to amend them. The 42nd meeting of the Central Standing Committee on the 22nd amended the above two regulations. After the legislative procedures are completed, the re-election of the National Assembly representatives will be actively promoted. The Central News Agency reporter visited a certain person on the 23rd to inquire about the significance of this amendment to the two regulations and the progress of the National Election work. According to reports, the most important points of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law amended by the Central Standing Committee are ㊀ amending the functions and powers of the National Assembly. According to the original National Assembly Organization Law, in addition to formulating the constitution, the National Assembly also had the power to exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. The amendment has deleted "exercising the powers conferred by the constitution" and clearly stipulates that "the term of this National Assembly shall end when the meeting is completed and the task is completed." The meaning is to enable this National Assembly to concentrate its efforts on drafting the constitution in order to produce a perfect constitution. ㊁ Deleting the item that the Chairman of the National Government may attend the National Assembly. Article 5 of the Organization Law stipulates that "the National Assembly shall be convened by the National Government on a regular basis." Since the National Government has the power to convene the National Assembly, the Chairman of the National Government can of course participate, and a special seat for the Chairman is set up in the National Assembly. The Central Standing Committee deleted this article to show respect for the Chairman. ㊂ Adding 240 representatives appointed by the National Government to the number of National Assembly representatives. This is to remedy the poverty of elections and to recruit talents from all parties and collect ideas for the drafting of the constitution. ㊃ Canceling all provisions in Article 6 and below of the Election Law regarding the designation of candidates by the National Government. This amendment can eliminate disputes in the designation and promote the spirit of universal suffrage. Therefore, the Central Standing Committee's amendment to the above two regulations has great significance and greatly facilitates the promotion of National Election work. Regarding National Election work, it can be actively promoted after the two regulations have undergone legislative procedures. It is expected that the re-election can be completed in March or April. The initial candidates will of course be valid in the re-election. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

Current Commentary

### The Transformation of the European Diplomatic Situation

— Hua

The recent European diplomatic situation is gradually transforming. This transformation can be summarized in the following points. ㊀ The small and medium-sized countries of Northern Europe, seeing the turmoil and dangers in Central Europe, are engaging in a kind of local unity to protect themselves. This is evidenced by the so-called Baltic Group brewing at the beginning of this year and the recent signing of the Oslo Agreement. ㊁ In the Spanish War, the armed intervention by Germany and Italy has now largely failed. Judging from the recent situation, although Germany and Italy cannot completely give up and quietly watch the collapse of the rebel army, their attitude of armed intervention will inevitably not be as blatant as before due to the implementation of coastal surveillance measures. ㊂ Germany has not only failed in Spain, but has also suffered many setbacks in Central and Eastern Europe. The failure of the pro-German cabinet in Finland, the removal of National Socialist Party members in Austria, Hungary's opposition to Fascist dictatorship, and Romania's strict prohibition of Iron Guard activities are all clear examples. These blows have a great impact on Germany's future aggressive activities. ㊃ Although Italy suffered losses in Spain, it gained something in the Italian-Yugoslav Pact. Now it is adopting a "eastward advance" diplomacy, consolidating the Italy-Austria-Hungary Danube Group on one hand, and wooing Romania on the other, while also prompting Austria and Czechoslovakia to be friendly, attempting to connect with Czechoslovakia through this relationship and gradually absorb the entire Little Entente under its wings. ㊄ The Soviet Union is now taking a wait-and-see attitude. France is cautiously dealing with the surrounding environment. Britain is taking advantage of this low tide in French diplomacy and the recent setbacks suffered by Germany, hoping to use its traditional dual diplomacy to manipulate the relationship between Germany and France and enhance its power in the European political situation.

Generally speaking, these transforming situations have more good elements than bad elements. Perhaps in the coming period, the European situation will achieve temporary calm. However, the possibility of this situation depends on two key factors. First, whether Hitler will suddenly take a risk to the east due to internal and external difficulties. Second, Britain's true attitude towards European peace. If it truly supports the system of collective peace, then taking advantage of the recent rumored international economic peace movement, Britain should decisively take action, connecting democratic countries such as the United States and France and even the pacifist Soviet Union to force Germany to abandon its aggressive ambitions. If its support for peace is hypocritical, then its policy will only encourage the adventurous ambitions of Germany and Italy. The German tearing up of the Locarno Treaty in March last year and the later German-Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War are clear examples.

According to the recent well-known "Dispatch" Weck in London, Hitler will invade Czechoslovakia with surprising actions during the coronation of the British monarch this year. This news seems to be unreliable, but according to observers, Mr. Hitler must show off to his people with some kind of external adventure every year to alleviate internal German unrest. Therefore, this kind of adventure is not absolutely impossible. However, whether Germany dares to do this ultimately depends on Britain's attitude. The action of attacking Czechoslovakia will inevitably involve France and the Soviet Union, which will be a real bomb that triggers a European war. Germany will not dare to act rashly without seeing the limits of Britain's tolerance.

Regarding Britain's attitude, some clues will be seen when diplomatic figures from various countries gather in London for the coronation of the British monarch next month. This transformation of the future European situation has a great relationship with the peace of the entire world and the international situation in the Far East. We should pay the greatest attention to the development of this situation.

### Tokyo Tram Workers Go on Strike After Wage Increase Request Fails

Military Spending Balloons and Prices Soar; Labor Disputes Reach a Climax

[Tokyo] Tokyo municipal tram and bus workers announced a strike this morning, so the new wave of Japanese labor disputes that has been brewing since the beginning of this year has reached its climax. Today, only half the usual number of trams and buses are running on the streets, and their speed is also extremely low. The main demand of the strikers is a 20% wage increase, while the Tokyo municipal authorities only agreed to a 6% increase. The expansion of military spending in recent years has caused prices to rise, resulting in a substantial reduction in actual wages. Workers feel that it is difficult to maintain a living in Tokyo with an average daily wage of 1.5 yen. The Army Ministry recently decided to increase the wages of the tens of thousands of workers it employs by 8% to alleviate the situation, fearing that reducing workers' living standards would seriously affect national health and social thought. The Tokyo municipal authorities' refusal to meet the workers' demands proves that their attitude is even less accommodating than that of the Army Ministry. Therefore, tram workers are very angry and have announced a strike. According to official statistics, there have been 900 registered labor disputes nationwide since the beginning of this year, which is half the total number of labor disputes last year. This year, 60% of labor disputes are workers demanding wage increases. Therefore, the nature of this labor unrest is mainly a defensive struggle by the working class to maintain a standard of living and oppose the inflation caused by the war. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### Kobe and Osaka Rise in Response

[Kobe] The Kobe Municipal Tram Workers' Union has also decided to echo the Tokyo tram strike, based on its previous request to the authorities for a 10% increase in actual wages, and to start a struggle. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

⊙Osaka The Osaka Municipal Electric Transportation Labor Union and other four groups, also inspired by the Tokyo tram workers' strike, intend to unite the great power of the workers to achieve the wage increase issue in one fell swoop. They have also scheduled a mass labor mobilization to gather at the Osaka City Hall on the morning of the 28th to urge the authorities to respond. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### Army Factory Workers Get Pay Raise

[Tokyo] Since taking office, Army Minister Sugiyama has paid great attention to the issue of improving national physique, especially increasing labor and expanding productivity. Recently, due to rising prices, workers' lives have become increasingly uneasy. He has decided to increase the wages of 100,000 workers in army factories. The increase is 8% of the wages paid on April 1st. The army authorities estimate that the increase in workers' wages will cost approximately 300,000 yuan annually. The army is the first to implement this among the workers in various government-run factories in Japan. The army's increase in wages for workers is a practical step in the Lin Cabinet's social policy and stabilizing the people's lives. However, according to the army's own view, government-owned industry workers are also directly related to national defense. Therefore, it does not hesitate to make great sacrifices to implement wage increases to stabilize workers' lives. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### Serious Nature, Authorities Pay Attention

[Tokyo] The Tokyo tram strike was fully implemented at dawn on the 23rd, igniting the flames of a decisive battle. The citizens, who are suffering from foot pain everywhere, are in a state of great chaos. The municipal authorities also pay attention to its future, and have limited the strike group headquarters to respond by the 24th. Now, it has been advanced to 1:00 PM on the 23rd, and the increase of six percent and two li is also notified. The group headquarters immediately convened a meeting of workers to discuss the results. The city authorities' solution was absolutely opposed, and this intention was notified to the authorities at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Therefore, the labor unrest has entered into a subtle movement, and there is still a tendency to worsen. If the municipal authorities are unwilling to propose a strong plan to the workers, this state of unease will continue, which can be predicted. The Metropolitan Police Department is currently running around trying to mediate. At this time of urgent general election, the situation is particularly worrying, and it is not known whether considerable coercive measures will be taken. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### Japan Adjusts Relations with Russia

Foreign Minister Sato Attends Cabinet Meeting to Report on the Content of Discussions

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato reported on the contents of his meeting with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev at today's Cabinet meeting. His words were as follows:

Soviet Ambassador Yurenev, who had returned home, has now returned to his post. I have met with him twice and exchanged opinions as much as possible on adjusting relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and resolving outstanding issues. At this time of great importance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is necessary to fully listen to the intentions of the relevant army and naval forces. Therefore, it has fully consulted with the army and navy ministers in advance, and then met with the Soviet ambassador. The ambassador will soon be transferred, so I would like to take this opportunity to put the relations between the two countries on a proper track.

In the future, the Foreign Minister and the Soviet Ambassador to Japan will have to hold successive meetings, and at the same time, the Three Ministers' talks will continue to be held. It is heard that Army Minister Sugiyama has sharper questions than Naval Minister Yonai on this matter. The meeting between the Foreign Minister and Soviet Ambassador Yurenev is extremely important to all parties. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### Rumor that Russian Ambassador to Japan Will Be Transferred to Berlin

[Berlin] Soviet Ambassador to Germany Suritz has been transferred to France. It is rumored here that Ambassador to Japan Yurenev will be transferred to Berlin. When Suritz left Germany, many believed that the envoy to Czechoslovakia, Alexandrovsky, would be transferred to Berlin. This plan has apparently been abandoned.

### League of Nations to Discuss Resource Issues

Japan Decides on Three Principles

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato summoned Yasuto Shuto, the Japanese representative who attended the Resources Special Committee in Geneva in March, to discuss various countermeasures because the League of Nations will reconvene the Resources Special Committee in Geneva in June. As a result, the basic policy was determined: to restore freedom on the three issues of obtaining resources, developing resources, and commerce and trade, in order to achieve equal distribution of resources among countries and establish a foundation for peace. Therefore, the Foreign Minister decided to order Representative Shuto to attend the committee and clarify Japan's position based on these three principles. In addition to the natural conditions of resource disparity, the resulting restrictions on commerce and other man-made conditions, the relationship between rich and poor countries breeds the causes of instability in the world atmosphere. Recently, after countries recognized this fact, those in the know strongly advocated the necessity of equal distribution of resources. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly decided last summer to establish a Special Committee on Resources to study and solve the specific methods of resource issues. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send Shuto to attend the meeting to advocate the three principles. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### A Woman Turns into a Man

⊙Brussels Ms. Tebom, who is twenty-three years old and from here, wins trophies in every bicycle race and has done so for five consecutive years. Two years ago, after undergoing surgery, she has become a great man and has taken the male name "Weilai." Although Ms. Tebom lacked female characteristics, everyone knew she was a woman until after undergoing surgery, when she wore men's clothing.

Recently, the local public security bureau, because her identity and photos, although belonging to two men and women, were very similar, began to investigate, and the secret of the lady was revealed. The authorities then only allowed her to choose to be a man or a woman, and the lady has admitted to being a man. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### End of Talks Between Italy and Austria, Rome Protocols Altered

Reshaping the Current Situation in the Danube Region, Austria Abandons Agreement with Czechoslovakia

⊙Venice Port: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini held his second meeting with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg at 11:00 AM this morning, which concluded at noon. They then had lunch together, with other representatives from both countries present. Mussolini returned to Rome in the afternoon, while the Austrian Chancellor is scheduled to return to Vienna at 6:00 PM this afternoon. In addition, the German ship "Mil-Ke" is currently anchored in this port. Prime Minister Mussolini visited the ship this morning and was greeted by the ship's owner, with both sides exchanging speeches. Prime Minister Mussolini spoke in German, and the ship's owner said, "We are visiting your country for the first time, and we are honored to receive greetings from your Prime Minister today." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 23rd)

⊙Venice Port: The main result of the talks between the Italian and Austrian authorities is the decision to abandon the proposal for an agreement between Austria and Czechoslovakia. Italy, adhering firmly to the political axis formed by Germany and Italy, defended Germany's interests and advised the Austrian authorities that if they wished to approach Czechoslovakia, they should not oppose Germany or disregard Germany's wishes. Furthermore, one point in the joint communiqué issued by the Italian and Austrian authorities is of particular interest: the Rome Protocols have been completely altered. In other words, the original goal of these protocols was to safeguard Austria's independence and to defend Hungary's views on the Central European situation. Now, they advocate reshaping the current situation in the Danube region countries in cooperation with Germany and certain countries in the Little Entente. The communiqué's statement that "Italy and Austria have completely identical views" implies that the Austrian government has formally endorsed the political axis formed by Germany and Italy. The communiqué does not mention the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria, and it seems that this issue was not discussed during the meeting between the Italian and Austrian authorities. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)

⊙Venice: Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg held a three-hour meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon, from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano and Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt were also present. The two authorities scheduled another meeting for 11:00 AM tomorrow morning. According to a key figure who participated in today's talks, the main topics of discussion were two: first, the relationship between Czechoslovakia and Austria and its connection to the Rome Protocols; and second, the agreements established between Germany and Austria and between Germany and Italy. According to informed sources, the Austrian Chancellor explained the Rome Protocols, believing that they allow each signatory country the freedom to develop diplomatic relations with non-signatory countries. Therefore, the mutual approach between Czechoslovakia and Austria is permitted by the protocols. However, the Italian side believes that the German-Austrian agreement and the German-Italian agreement are complementary to the Rome Protocols. Therefore, the signatories of the Rome Protocols should not adopt an attitude opposing Germany. The agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia does not conflict with the Rome Protocols because it does not oppose Germany. As for Czechoslovakia and Austria, if they wish to approach each other, it must be conditional on not opposing Germany. Political figures believe that Italy's adoption of this attitude is not only to protect Germany's interests but also to protect Hungary's interests. Since Italy has signed political and economic agreements with Yugoslavia and recently proposed mutual cooperation with Romania, Hungary can no longer make territorial claims regarding the Transylvanian province occupied by Yugoslavia and Romania (which belonged to Hungary before the European War). Therefore, Italy can only encourage Hungary to focus on Czechoslovakia. If Czechoslovakia and Austria approach each other, Hungary's territorial demands will inevitably be blocked everywhere and have no outlet. In addition, it is heard that the negotiations between Italy and Austria also involved military issues. As for the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria, it will be resolved in a vague manner as a "non-realistic issue." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Communiqué Issued

⊙Venice: The Italian and Austrian Prime Ministers continued their talks this morning and issued a communiqué afterward, stating, "The common goal of Prime Minister Mussolini and Chancellor Schuschnigg for Italian-Austrian cooperation to reshape the current situation in the Danube region cannot be achieved without Germany's participation. The views on the mutual relations between Italy and Austria and other countries, as well as various issues related to Italy and Austria, especially economic issues, are completely consistent after discussions between the two sides. Furthermore, the Rome Protocols signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary in March of last year, which stipulate that other countries in the Danube region may also sign and join under certain conditions, have produced good results and are deeply gratified. In short, the Rome Protocols, the agreement between Italy and Austria established in July of last year, and the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia established in March of this year are of great benefit to the development of the Central European situation and European general peace." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 23rd)

### Polish Foreign Minister Visits Roman Authorities

Seeking to Expand Former Alliance

⊙Romanian Capital: After arriving here, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck met with King Carol for a long time and then met with the Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Well-informed sources recently stated that Poland and Romania signed an alliance treaty in 1921, which included a mutual assistance agreement, and that further expansion is planned, with the army staff departments of the two countries cooperating further. In addition, the Romanian authorities also advocate attracting Czechoslovakia and Poland, and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has also suggested that Romania should improve its mutual relations with Hungary. The economic relations and tourism matters between Poland and Romania have been handed over to experts for research. In short, the attitude of both parties in this talk was very friendly and mutually trusting. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### British and French Military Authorities Hold Talks in London

Release Belgium from Locarno Obligations, Anglo-French Declaration Postponed

[London] After arriving here yesterday afternoon, French State Councillor and Minister of National Defense Daladier held talks that evening at the French Embassy with British Minister for Coordination of Defence Sir Thomas Inskip, Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha, Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Sir Cyril Deverell, and many other senior British generals. Well-informed sources state that, regarding the cooperation and assistance to Belgium by Britain and France after Belgium's cancellation of the guarantor obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty, a complete compromise has been reached between Britain and France as a result of this discussion. It is reported that British military experts have proposed to France that if Belgium is invaded in the future, the aid provided by Britain and France to that country should be limited to the air force, so as to avoid any hasty action on the army side due to a lack of prior preparation, which would lead to various dangers. As for the cooperation between Britain and France, the agreement between the staff departments of the two countries remains effective and should continue to maintain close contact. Britain is very pleased that France is currently extending the "Maginot Line" (named after the late French Minister of War) to the northern border, which makes France safe on the northern frontier. At noon today, Daladier had lunch with Foreign Secretary Eden at the Savoy Hotel. According to well-informed sources, the two discussed the matter of Eden visiting Belgium to consult after the publication of the joint Anglo-French declaration. In addition, the two also explained that Britain and France have completely identical views on various international issues, such as the non-intervention issue in the Spanish Civil War, the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, and the establishment of an international agreement to publicize the military status of each country. Daladier has accompanied the French Ambassador to Britain Corbin to Manchester in the evening to attend and deliver a speech at the local branch of the Anglo-French Friendship Association. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)

[London] Regarding the publication of a joint declaration by Britain and France to release Belgium from the guarantor obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty, diplomatic sources recently stated that the declaration will be postponed for several days. The Belgian government has requested slight modifications to the original wording, so a new draft was prepared after discussions between French State Councillor and Minister of National Defence Daladier, who is currently here, and the British authorities, and was submitted to the Belgian government for review. As of now, Belgium has not yet indicated acceptance. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### France Is Willing to Defend Freedom

Daladier Delivers a Speech

⊙Manchester: French Minister of National Defence Daladier stated in a speech to the annual meeting of the Anglo-French Association here today that wealth and welfare in the modern world can only be obtained through free trade. The opposition between freedom and autocracy in the past is now seen in the economic and financial spheres, and the escalation of its methods will inevitably lead to an explosion one day. He does not approve of those who believe in force and neglect reason. We should fully defend Western civilization, which is based on love of freedom, aspires to respect life, and respects the belief in freedom of creation. Some people are making malicious propaganda about France, claiming that we are about to fall into the abyss of communism and cannot extricate ourselves. This kind of statement is not worth a knowledgeable person's smile. I dare to assure you that France is prepared to cooperate with Britain. France's friendship with the British people has never been deeper than it is today, and you can be comforted by this. (National Telegram, 23rd)

### Soviet Political System

—Declared by the Russian Ambassador to the United States—

[Washington] Russian Ambassador to the United States Troyanovsky declared here today, "If an 'incomplete democratic system' wants to compete with 'complete fascism,' the Soviet Union will fully support democratic countries." He attacked the claim that the Soviet Union is a dictatorial political system as a mistake. Fundamentally, the Soviet Union is completely based on democracy, only with enemies on all sides and no way to defend itself. (National Telegram, 22nd)

[New York] The British King's Coronation special issue published by the Christian Science Monitor here today contains an article by President Roosevelt, which states that Britain and the United States have a common purpose, which is to maintain peace throughout the world. This common purpose has always existed, like a common inspiration. Peace cannot be demanded, but can be achieved through hard work. Civilians everywhere in the civilized world do not want to live in peace with each other. The maintenance of peace also depends on the unanimous support of newspapers around the world.

### Lansbury Returns from Germany

Hoping to Meet with Italian Prime Minister to Discuss Peace Plan

[London] British Labour MP Lansbury, after meeting with German leader Hitler in Berlin as a peace envoy, returned to Dover today and issued two statements to journalists, saying that he hopes to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss his world peace plan. Now, he has met with all the major European and American politicians. He returned to the country with a belief that the tragedy of war that will be inflicted on the world can be averted. He believes that the world is now gradually abandoning its warlike spirit. The world is currently on the edge of a cliff, but at least he can say that in the last five days, he has not seen anyone who does not want peace. He and German leader Hitler both understand that the future is not without difficulties, but they all believe that these difficulties can be resolved in good faith. Today's Non-Intervention Committee has proved that the round table conference of representatives of various countries to discuss extremely important issues can avoid encountering real obstacles and make the conference fruitless. In Berlin, it was suggested to him that the Non-Intervention Committee might continue to meet in order to discuss the feasibility of convening a world peace conference.

### German Perspective

US, French and Belgian Staff Conference is Preparing a Plan Against Germany

[Berlin] German General Major-General Metz Black published an article in the Berlin Daily today, explaining the German perspective on the upcoming consultation in Beijing between Britain, France and Belgium. The article is clearly aimed at British Foreign Secretary Eden's upcoming visit to Belgium. According to public information, Britain and France are now seeking to obtain some form of understanding with the Belgian General Staff. In his article, Metz first stated that the consultations of the staff departments of the three countries are contradictory to the issue of neutrality. True neutrality does not require joint consultations with the staff departments of neighboring countries, and the purpose of the consultations is only to anticipate a common enemy and prepare for a response plan. In other words, the consultations of the staff departments of Britain, France and Belgium are irrelevant to the issue of neutrality and are merely anticipating Germany as a common enemy. After the publication of this article, military and political figures here have paid great attention. (National Maritime Telegram, 22nd)

### Montreux Conference Making Rapid Progress

Egypt Abolishes Consular Jurisdiction, Two Technical Issues Remain to be Resolved

⊙Montreux: The current Egyptian consular jurisdiction conference is now making rapid progress, which is the opposite of what was predicted a week ago. France's previous strong attitude has greatly eased after the French chief representative Tedson returned home to ask for instructions. After Ted returned from France, he had a banquet and a long talk with Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas Pasha. Optimists say that the conference is expected to be resolved quickly before the coronation of the British King. The technical issues that remain to be resolved are as follows: ㊀How to supplement the vacancies of foreign judges in the Mixed Courts during the transition period, ㊁The status of nationals and protected persons, ㊂The Egyptian Minister of Justice should consult with the Mixed Courts when announcing judicial regulations. Furthermore, the harmonious relationship between Britain and Egypt at this conference is quite remarkable. Egypt praised the UK for adhering to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, and the Egyptian representatives enthusiastically agreed with any suggestions made by the British side, which reduced a lot of concerns among other representatives. British consular representative Wallace told reporters today that Britain now has two missions. On the one hand, the UK is one of the countries with consular jurisdiction, and on the other hand, it is a party to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and helps Egypt get rid of the shackles of surrender treaties. He said that the interests of British merchants in Egypt would not suffer losses, and he did not believe that Egypt would discriminate against foreigners after the end of the transition period.

Between 4:30 PM and 5:00 PM in the afternoon, more than 30 shells fell in the Layu area. Pedestrians and tram passengers on the street fled in panic, and the injured were transported to the hospital by ambulance. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### British All Sectors Actively Transporting Food to Aid the Civilians of the Port of Bilbao

[London] British trade unions donated 200 tons of grain and handed them over to the British ship "Bakewitz" to be transported to the port of Bilbao, Spain, to aid the besieged soldiers and civilians there. Other organizations, such as the Friends Church, the Spanish Medical Aid Association, etc., raised £2,000 to purchase food and medical supplies, which were also handed over to the ship. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George contributed £250 and attached a short note saying, "I am a Basque, and General Foch is also a Basque. The Welsh and Basques are of the same race." The "Bakewitz" is piloted by Captain Russell and is expected to set sail on Saturday or Sunday. British warships will escort it to the three-mile limit. Several British MPs are now planning to board the ship to Bilbao. After unloading the goods, the ship will transport refugees, women and children to Britain or France. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Three British Merchant Ships Break Through the Blockade Line

⊙Saint-Jean-de-Luz: The British merchant ships "Stanbrook," "Macgregor," and "Hansterly" successively left this port in the dark of night yesterday to head for Bilbao. The ships only showed a faint light. The three ships risked danger and broke through the Nationalist blockade line, delivering the food they were carrying to the garrison. The 42,100-ton British battlecruiser "Hood" and other warships outside the port exchanged signals with each other, indicating that the ships knew the actions of the three ships. Today, three port workers arrived here from Bilbao to serve as pilots for the three ships. According to Nationalist leader General Franco, he has threatened to stop British grain ships from entering the port of Bilbao, even if it means starting a war with the British Navy. He has also secretly laid mines in the port of Bilbao. Therefore, the three British ships currently heading to Bilbao are not only in danger of being sunk by Nationalist warships but also in danger of being blown up by contact mines. From an international observation point of view, a conflict between British warships and Nationalist warships may be unavoidable, and the situation will become more serious.

### Japanese Political Exposition Displays Heartbreaking Chinese Materials

Overview of the Manchukuo Puppet Organization: Japan's Control of the Puppet Organization

Tokyo Special Dispatch: The Japanese Political Exposition was held in Hibiya on the 30th, displaying political materials and models from various countries. The reporter visited on the 14th, and the details are as follows:

Exposition Venue

The entire venue is very large, divided into eleven pavilions: Constitution, Figures, Army, Navy, Diplomacy, Foreign Countries, Overseas Territories, Transportation, Local Areas, Collaboration, and "Manchukuo." The eastern part of the lower floor houses the Local Pavilion, the House of Peers Meeting Hall, the Transportation Pavilion, offices, and a cafeteria. The western part houses the Collaboration Pavilion, the House of Representatives Meeting Hall, offices, and a guard room. The eastern part of the upper floor houses the Figures Pavilion, the House of Peers Meeting Hall, the "Manchukuo Pavilion," and the Army Pavilion. The central part houses the Constitution Pavilion and the Overseas Territories Pavilion. The western part houses the Foreign Countries Pavilion, the House of Representatives Meeting Hall, the Navy Pavilion, the Diplomacy area, and a rest area. The exhibits in each pavilion have their own value, but Chinese compatriots studying in Japan who visit the "Manchukuo Pavilion" all feel that it is a crystallization of sorrow and cannot help but shed tears.

Heartbreaking Organization

The "Manchukuo Pavilion" contains many materials, all related to the political situation of the puppet organization after September 18th. These are materials that compatriots in the motherland should know but are not easy to obtain. In terms of political organization, its governance methods are as follows: The highest ruler is the puppet emperor, followed by ⑴ the puppet State Council, ⑵ the puppet Imperial Household Agency, ⑶ the puppet Palace Affairs Office, ⑷ the puppet Privy Council, ⑸ the puppet General's Office, ⑹ the puppet Military Attache Office, ⑺ the puppet Legislative Yuan, ⑻ the puppet State Council Advisors, ⑼ the puppet Control Yuan, ⑽ the puppet Supreme Court, and ⑾ the puppet Supreme Audit Office. The organization of the puppet State Council is the most complex, divided into a "Bureau, a Court, five Bureaus, and nine Departments," namely the General Affairs Bureau, the Continental Scientific Academy, the Construction and Supply Bureau, the Awards Bureau, the National Highway Bureau, the National Capital Construction Bureau, the Land Registration Bureau, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Mongolian Affairs. Each department is further divided into divisions and offices. Except for the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Mongolian Affairs, the rest are divided into divisions but have no offices. The Ministry of Civil Affairs is divided into six divisions and twelve offices, with the six divisions being the General Affairs Division, the Local Affairs Division, the Reclamation Division, the Police Affairs Division, the Civil Engineering Division, and the Health Division. The twelve offices are the Jilin Provincial Office, the Xinjing (Changchun) Special Municipality Office, the Longjiang Provincial Office, the Heihe Provincial Office, the Sanjiang Provincial Office, the Binjiang Provincial Office, the Jiandao Provincial Office, the Andong Provincial Office, the Fengtian Provincial Office, the Jinzhou Provincial Office, the Rehe Provincial Office, and the Harbin Special Municipality Office. The Ministry of Mongolian Affairs is divided into the General Affairs Civil Affairs, the Industry Promotion, and three divisions, and the Xing'an East Province, Xing'an West Province, Xing'an South Province, and Xing'an North Province four offices. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is divided into the General Affairs, Commerce, Political Affairs, and Propaganda four divisions. The Ministry of Military Affairs is divided into the Horse Administration, the General Staff, and the Military Supplies three divisions and a part of the Military Investigation Department. The Ministry of Finance is divided into the General Affairs, Taxation, and Financial Administration three divisions. The Ministry of Industry is divided into the General Affairs, Agriculture, Forestry, Mining, and Commerce five divisions. The Ministry of Transportation is divided into the General Affairs, Railways, and Shipping three divisions. The Ministry of Justice is divided into the General Affairs, Civil Affairs, Criminal Affairs, and Execution four divisions. The Ministry of Education is divided into the General Affairs, Academic Affairs, and Etiquette three divisions. The materials in each court, department, office, bureau, and office mostly contain texts expressing sincerity and gratitude to Japan and management plans. Although the highest leaders of each agency are from Northeast China, the real power is in the hands of Japanese advisors. Those who work diligently and do not discuss right and wrong not only receive the grace of having their lives preserved but can also receive a dry salary of more than 100 yuan per month. The general puppet officials, as docile as sheep, bow their heads and fulfill their duties within the prescribed scope. If they don't use opium, they use morphine. This is the so-called sheep-like life.

Japanese Rule

Japan is doing everything possible to rule Manchuria. It is also necessary to pay attention to Japan's political organization in Manchuria. Its organization is as follows: Under the Prime Minister of the Japanese Cabinet, there is ⑴ the President of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs, concurrently held by the Minister of the Army, ⑵ the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Manchuria, concurrently held by the Commander of the Kwantung Army, ⑶ the Commander of the Kwantung Army Headquarters. The organization of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs is simple. Under the Embassy to Manchuria is the Kwantung Bureau, with one Director-General, divided into halls, bureaus, offices, and departments: (1) Fengtian Relief Center, (2) Exchange, (3) Observatory, (4) Kwantung Government, (5) Police Station, (6) High Court, (7) District Court, (8) High Court Prosecutor's Office, (9) Postal Bureau, (10) Prison, (11) Maritime Bureau, (12) Monopoly Bureau, (13) College of Engineering, (14) Police Officer Training School, (15) Secretariat (with one Chief), (16) Administrative Department (with one Director), (17) Police Department (with one Director, concurrently held by the Commander of the Military Police), (18) Supervisory Department (with one Director, concurrently held by the Director of Military Traffic Supervision). The Kwantung Government is very large in scale, divided into the Secretariat, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Police Department, the Civil Administration Office, the Police Station, the Museum, the Dalian Fire Department, the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Horse Breeding Station, the Library, the Institute of Physical Education, the Fisheries Experiment Station, the Salt Industry Experiment Station, the Dalian Relief Center, the Lushun Hospital, the Women's Hospital, the Lushun Sanatorium, the Dalian Sanatorium, the Middle School, the Lushun Girls' High School, the Dalian Girls' High School, the Lushun Higher Public School, the Dalian Industrial School, the Lushun Home Economics Girls' School, the Dalian Home Economics Girls' School, the Dalian Higher School, the Jinzhou Agricultural School, and the Dalian School for the Deaf and Dumb. The Kwantung Army Headquarters has one Commander of the Kwantung Army, with considerable power, who is a trustee of the military. Under him are the General Staff, advisors, the Military Traffic Supervision Department (with one Director), and the Military Police Headquarters (with one Commander). Japan's political organization in Manchuria is more rigorous than the East India Company. Its purpose is to seek a so-called permanent unification of Japan and Manchuria. (14th)

### Construction of Fuzhou Tap Water

Groundbreaking Ceremony Held at Longtan Mountain; First Phase of Project to be Completed by the End of Next Year

Fuzhou Correspondence: Fuzhou, the provincial capital of Fujian Province, has been deliberating the construction of tap water since before 1929, but it did not materialize. In 1934, the provincial government was reorganized, and attention was paid to it. Chen Ticheng of the Construction Department proposed fundraising methods, which were approved by the provincial government and received a remaining fund of 26,000 yuan from the provincial defense donation to start preparations. Later, due to limited funds, in accordance with Article 2 of the National Government's promotion methods, the Construction Department used the Minhou deed tax and the provincial capital's vehicle donation and other construction project income as collateral to issue 900,000 yuan in tap water public bonds, which were approved by the provincial government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.

When the preparatory office was established, the project was divided into two phases. The first phase planned to supply water to Nantai, the commercial center, and neighboring areas (with a water volume sufficient for 150,000 people). It was best to take water from the upper reaches of the northern branch of the Yuejiang River as the water source. However, since the first phase was limited to the Nantai area, it was appropriate to choose a location near that area for the intake, and it must not be affected by changes in the waterway. Therefore, it was decided to take Longtan Mountain as the water source for the first phase. Preliminary plans and the first phase of water supply engineering were immediately drafted and submitted for approval. The Central Trust Bureau was entrusted to handle the procurement procedures, and letters were sent to various companies and foreign firms, instructing them to contact the Trust Bureau directly, with price lists sent directly to the Construction Department for review. At that time, a total of 29 companies received the drawings, but only three submitted quotations. Among them, only Siemens, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi were close to the budget. Therefore, the Construction Department submitted a report to Chairman Chen, who instructed Mitsubishi to re-draft the engineering layout so as not to exceed 600,000 yuan. After several consultations, detailed designs by tap water experts were studied and reduced to 599,700 yuan after repeated reductions. After obtaining the consent of the head office and the official signing of the approved issuance of construction public bonds, construction could begin. However, before long, copper prices soared more than doubled, and the prices of machinery and raw materials also increased by more than 200,000 yuan, and the project almost became a pie in the sky. Fortunately, the public bonds had been approved by the central government, and the Central Trust Bureau had also agreed on a method of advancing funds, and the equipment was slightly changed. Finally, on April 5th of this year, a formal contract was signed in Shanghai at the original price, and the first installment of 200,000 yuan was paid immediately. The groundbreaking ceremony was held at Longtan Mountain on the 14th of this month. The venue was beautifully decorated on that day. Around 2 p.m., people from all walks of life participated one after another, including Chairman Chen, members of the party and government, leaders from all walks of life, and foreign guests, totaling more than 500 people. The Director of the Construction Department presided over the meeting, reported on the progress, and hoped that it would be completed in a year and a half. Next, the Chairman gave a speech, and the representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters gave a speech. After the ceremony, Chairman Chen, Chen Ticheng, Gao Dengting, Si Lie, Zheng Zhenwen, Chen Jinglie, and others personally took up shovels and performed the groundbreaking ceremony. The ceremony was completed at 4 p.m.

### Wuxi: Smuggling of Steel Discovered

The Huangbudun Police Station of the County Police Bureau's Water Police Team found a large boat unloading goods from Suzhou to Zhenjiang the day before yesterday, containing 430 dan and 76 jin of scrap copper and iron. Because there was no passport from the Ministry of Military Affairs, it was detained, and the boat owner, He Xingfa, was taken to the station and transferred to the general bureau. Yesterday, he was transferred to the county government for interrogation. Section Chief Li held a court session to interrogate him. According to his confession, the owner of the goods was named Wang Zonghai, who lived in the New World Hotel. The county government temporarily released He Xingfa on bail and summoned the owner of the goods, Wang Naihai, to the case for interrogation. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the provincial government to request instructions on how to handle it.

### Changzhou: Old Meng River Turns into a Lake

The Wuyi County Government reported on the 22nd via telegram from Zhu Tianying, the district chief of the third district and director of the Old Meng River dredging project, stating that the project ordered to dredge the Old Meng River had started on the 6th of this month, and the project was progressing smoothly. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 20th, there was a windstorm and heavy rain that lasted all night. The fields along the river had no embankments or surrounding roads. Once rainwater accumulated, there was no way to stop it. In addition, mountain floods poured down, and the fields within a radius of 40 li around were turned into lakes. The overflowing on both banks could not be stopped, and human power could not prevent it, etc. According to the telegram, the county government, in addition to forwarding a telegram to the Construction Department to request instructions, will also send personnel to the countryside for inspection.

### Dinghai: New Technician Appointed at Aquatic Products Farm

The position of technician at the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Farm is extremely important. After the establishment of the farm, Director Chen Tongbai had chosen from many candidates and appointed Chen Chunshou, Lin Shuyan, and Wu Zhongyuan as technicians, all of whom were famous and rare aquatic product talents in the country. Recently, technician Wu Zhongyuan resigned due to personal reasons. After a period of investigation to recruit a replacement, Zhang Yuandi, the principal of the Hebei Aquatic Products Vocational School, introduced Wang Yiguan, the top graduate of the school's vocational program, who had studied fisheries and aquaculture in Japan at public expense and obtained an excellent degree, to serve as a technician at the farm. It is reported that Wang spent more than four years studying in Japan. After graduating, he continued to engage in advanced research in the special department of the Tokyo Fisheries Training Institute in Japan. He worked extremely hard on weekdays and wrote a lot, which was highly praised by experts in the country. After Wang received the appointment approved by the Construction Department, he has already taken a ship from Japan via Shanghai and transferred to the farm to take office. With the assistance of this expert, the farm will surely make more contributions in the future.

Detailed Report on the Wind Disaster Tragedy

A sudden gale hit the ocean surface of Shengshan the day before yesterday, causing great damage to fishing boats of various gangs. It is impossible to count the number of those who had their masts broken, rudders broken, oars lost, and anchors lost, colliding and drifting. According to the investigation, seven fishing boats were overturned, and 68 people drowned as a result. Fishing has been suspended for five days, and the loss in material production is difficult to estimate for the time being. As for those who were killed by the overturning of boats, there was one Wang Gongyu net boat from Baihushan Mouth, Shenjiamen, with seven deaths, one Yan Yongfu net boat from the Hu Gang, with seven deaths, one Hao Lin net boat, with seven deaths, one Xin Yuting net boat, with seven deaths, one A Lin net boat, with seven deaths, one Zhang family fishing boat, with six deaths, and one Aoshan mid-way boat, with twenty-seven deaths.

### Ningbo: Preparing to Organize Oil Conversion Experiment Site

Ding Meihe, a citizen of Yin County, in view of the fact that the kerosene needed daily in our country is all supplied by foreign oceans, which is a huge leak, and in order to counteract it, he has devoted himself to research and has gained a lot of experience in recent years. He now plans to set up a factory for experiments, named the China Oil Conversion Experiment Site. The raw material is diesel oil, which is chemically tested in the field using scientific methods. The oil converted is called chemical artificial oil, and the amount and price used are reduced compared to the original kerosene. He has already submitted an application to the county government for registration and will open the site after submitting it to the province for approval and obtaining a permit.

### Gaoyou: Terrible Smallpox Epidemic

The climate in this county has been cold and hot recently, resulting in a smallpox epidemic. The Education Bureau has specially dispatched health instructor Jin Weifan to various schools to vaccinate students to avoid infection. The county hospital also provides free vaccinations.

### Bengbu: Railway Bureau Organizes Investigation Team

In order to understand the economic conditions of various places along the line, the Jinpu Railway Bureau has specially organized an investigation team, divided into four groups, and appointed Chen Peiyu as the leader to lead all personnel to various provinces, cities, and counties along the line for field investigation. The areas in northern Anhui include Quanjiao, Chuxian, Lai'an, Jiashan, Xuyi, Sixian, Wuhe, Dingyuan, Chaoxian, Liu'an, Huoqiu, Fuyang, Taihe, Haoxian, Guoyang, Mengcheng, Lingbi, Suxian, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Yingshang, Shou County, Fengtai, Zhengyang, Suixi, Bengbu, and 26 counties and towns. All agricultural, mineral, forest, livestock, industrial, commercial, and real industries, as well as boat, vehicle transportation, and local products, are included in the investigation.

### Anecdotes from the Yunnan Journey (4)

— Beibeiquan

The weapons of the conscripted soldiers in Jiangxi Province are all spears (i.e., long spears). A few of the spear shafts still have red, green, and black spiral patterns, similar to the patterns on a barber shop sign. This is probably from ten years ago and can be seen among those who were coerced and have returned to reform themselves. The conscripted soldiers along the way mostly have pale faces due to lack of nutrition, resembling the haggard appearance of the blocked areas a few years ago. However, school-age children have a better complexion, which shows that food is the most important thing for the people. The burden of revitalizing the new Jiangxi in the future should be placed on their shoulders.

Gao'an has a population of over 400,000, with more women than men, probably because the strong men have scattered in all directions. Gao'an was once the prefectural city of Suizhou and has a good literary style. Recently, legislator Peng Chunshi is also from Han Gao'an. Peng is the son-in-law of Wei Zonghan. A few years ago, Duan Qirui and Chiang Kai-shek communicated and exchanged feelings through Peng. He is the only talent in Gao'an.

In the evening, we arrived in Wanzai. Wanzai is a ramie cloth producing area. In the past, it was sold abroad, with an annual value of over 10 million yuan. Since Korea used Japanese cloth, exports have sharply decreased. The bandit rebellion destroyed the almost extinct profession. Although it has recovered slightly recently, it is less than one-tenth of its former state. The year before last, a student named Ni was sent to factories such as Mengques in the UK to specialize in the study of ramie cloth. It is hoped that after his return, a large-scale ramie cloth factory will be jointly operated by officials and merchants. Mr. Ni is probably going to be Jiangxi's second Du Chongyuan.

That night, the world-renowned Wang Baochuan, Mr. Xiong Shi'yi, arrived from Nanchang and joined our ranks along the way. Mr. Xiong is a handsome young man in a blue shirt and black jacket, looking like a young master. It is unknown that he has already traveled around half the globe. The place where we stayed was the east and west sesame of the Confucius Temple. While colleagues were tidying up their beds, someone joked, "We are now qualified to be enshrined in Nishan." Someone else said, "Although we are disturbing Confucius for one night tonight, the temple has been renewed because of our transit. Confucius certainly won't mind our presence." (It is said that Wanzai's hospitality and renovation of the city appearance cost 3,000 yuan from the province and 2,000 yuan from the local area. It is quite harsh to ask the people to bear 2,000 yuan in a town that has been robbed).

Originally, the tour of academic groups and the local inspection of officials of the central government are extremely common. It is best not to have local supply, because supply will labor the people, and the conscripted soldiers lining up for two or three hundred miles is laboring the people. Especially during the busy farming season, every moment is gold. Although the provincial authorities want to be too good, it is a great loss to the people. Even those who receive it feel ashamed and blush and show a shrunken state. As for requisitioning civilians to carry luggage without paying them, it is even more uneasy. Other things, such as lighting more than 100,000 firecrackers, who will compensate for this consumption? The people of Jiangxi have just realized the cruelty and deception of the Soviets and have returned to reform themselves. Now, encountering the supplies and arrangements for the passage of this "bourgeois" group, wouldn't it add some bad impressions?

The ninth day (April 13th), we set off from Wanzai, passed through Shangqu City, and passed Dongfeng, which is the border between Jiangxi and Hunan. Since then, we entered Hunan Province. The population density has greatly increased, and the land is full of rice fields. There are tree planting areas next to the highway. Because we heard the night before that more than 100 armed people had passed through the boundary between Wan and Liu, it was unknown whether they were civilians or bandits. A regiment of troops was dispatched in advance to guard. At noon, we arrived at Dayaoshi in Liuyang, the birthplace of Tan Sitong and Tang Caichang (Tang Youwang is the second son of Caichang). The villages are mostly aristocratic families with excellent culture. At noon, we arrived in Liuyang and crossed a 200-foot river. The bridge has not yet been completed. The entire county of Liuyang has a population of over 800,000, and the urban and rural population is over 60,000. The city streets are prosperous, and schools and public undertakings have everything. It is the richest county in Hunan Province. We had lunch at the Confucius Temple. The provincial authorities advocate ancient music and have compiled a dance troupe in Liuyang. All the Zhou system, metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, wood, and pottery instruments such as bells and Yu are complete. The pavilions, terraces, and roof ridges of the temple are all built with blue and white porcelain tiles from the Daoguang era. The Confucius Temple is exquisite. Except for Qufu, I am afraid there is no place so exquisite. The main cadres of the ancient music bureau led sixty-four dancers, wearing sacrificial clothes, such as the Shangding Ceremony, and performed the Eight Yi Dance in the courtyard. All the musical instruments played together, and the tone was solemn. People said that Chairman He Yunqiao advocated restoration. We said that this is not too much to blame. Ancient music may as well be preserved.

In the afternoon, the highway between Liuyang and Changsha was flat, and the bridges were all changed to culverts. Tens of thousands of paulownia trees were planted along the road, which have been four or five years old. Now the paulownia flowers are in full bloom, mixed with new willows and poplars, forming shade along the road. The scenery all the way is really beautiful. Our head of the group, Chu Minyi, and Mr. Xiong Shi'yi took the 14th car for half the journey. Someone joked that Wang Baochuan and Sima Yi were traveling to Changsha in the same car. Xiong became famous in England for writing Wang Baochuan, and Chu played Sima Yi at a charity event last year, hence this wonderful metaphor. However, it is a bit disrespectful to both Chu and Xiong. The recorder can only apologize here.

Shenshi (3-5 pm) and the Xiangjiang ferry were very fast. We changed to ferry to enter Changsha City. The local authorities provided tea and refreshments at the Public National Defense Club to wait for the arrival of luggage. We were assigned to stay and rest. In the evening, Director Fu of the Construction Department, who is from Yu籍, hosted a banquet at the Sanhe Restaurant. It was raining heavily, the first time we had encountered rain in the nine days of our trip, and it was after arriving in Changsha, which can be counted as a smooth trip.

In recent days, it has been rumored that the Control Yuan and its subordinate agencies are discussing holding birthday celebrations for Mr. Yu and raising funds to build a library. Mr. Yu sent telegrams to Nanjing the day before yesterday, resolutely refusing, saying that national revival should be worked on from a practical point of view, and if this trend is started in this court, the whole country will follow suit, then how will it end? Mr. Yu came to Shanghai with a leg disease some days ago. In order to avoid birthday celebrations, he decided to change places for recuperation in the near future and abolish all ceremonies, and even praise and flattering articles will never be accepted.

### Supervisors Going to Guizhou Report Serious Disaster Situation in Guizhou

Victims All Eat Grass Roots and Tree Bark; Telegrams Request All Parties to Solicit Relief

The drought in Guizhou Province is very serious. In addition to the Ministry of Finance allocating 100,000 yuan in relief funds to Guizhou, the Executive Yuan has also sent a special commissioner, Cheng Jingsheng, to Guizhou for investigation. Charity organizations in the city received a telegram from Mr. Cheng yesterday, requesting them to solicit donations from all parties to provide relief. The original telegram said, (excerpt) The drought in Guizhou Province is very serious. I, Jingsheng, was sent by the Executive Yuan to Guizhou to supervise the relief efforts. I rushed to Guizhou and inspected along the way. I arrived in the counties on the 20th. The counties have not had a drop of rain for several months, the land is cracked, and the spring harvest is hopeless. The victims all eat mineral-quality Guanyin powder and tree bark and grass roots as food, their faces are pale, and they are not covered in clothes. People are like hell, the tragedy is unbearable. Moreover, the number of cattle being transported and driven on the left side of the road is innumerable. Agricultural work has been abandoned, and the disaster area covers almost the entire province. The severely affected areas reach 41 counties, most of which are about to die. Although the central government has allocated money and the provincial government has implemented measures, the disaster is serious and the money is insufficient. Chairman Gu, Brigade Commander Cao, and the officials of the provincial government are planning day and night, sighing and looking up at the roof. Guizhou Province is located on the border, surrounded by mountains, and is known for its barrenness. The livelihood is rooted in it, but the folk customs are honest and the physique is strong. The bravery and fighting skills and the spirit of self-reliance are unmatched by other provinces. The provincial government has guided them appropriately, so they can deeply understand patriotism, are trained properly, and will soon be the choice of the country. If they are allowed to fall into the ditches, the loss after the disaster will be a great loss to the country. It is not only unbearable to be indifferent. When the time comes when the green and yellow crops are not connected, it is even more a matter of life and death. Now I am discussing concrete measures with the provincial government to rush to handle emergency work, and give aid to grain. However, the approximate statistics, in addition to the allocated public bonds, at least 1 million yuan in cash must be raised to start. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan requesting additional allocations, I also ask you to think about the victims in the border areas and generously call on charity organizations at home and abroad and people of justice to help quickly and provide assistance to the isolated leaders. Tears and words, I look forward to your kind response. Cheng Jingsheng respectfully.

### Actively Carrying Out the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Project

Expected to be Fully Completed Before the End of August

Since the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau commenced the construction of the Hangzhou-Cao'e section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line, although various engineering works have been slightly delayed, they are expected to be completed before the Qianjiang River Bridge opens to traffic by the end of August. The current status of the various projects is as follows: ⑴ The earthwork and stonework for the entire line's roadbed have been significantly affected by continuous rainfall since the beginning of spring. Approximately 70% of the work has now been completed. The engineering office is currently preparing small steel rails, flatcars, barges, and other tools and is employing over a thousand workers to work day and night. If the weather improves, the project can be completed by mid-June. ⑵ The earthwork for the stations, except for Xiaoshan and Shaoxing stations, has been over 80% completed. ⑶ All seventy-seven small bridges on the entire section were initially planned to be completed by the end of last month. However, due to the poor soil quality of the bridge foundations, the foundation piling work had to be changed, resulting in a slight extension of the completion date compared to the original contract. Most of the work has now been completed, and the construction of wing walls and the dredging of river channels are underway. It is expected that all will be completed this month. ⑷ The water pipe project, except for the seven additional locations requested by various legal entities in the Shaoxing area, has been mostly completed. Only a few remaining stone masonry works for the retaining walls and wing walls remain. ⑸ The reinforced concrete caissons for the Cao'e Bridge have already been built and are being sunk using pneumatic methods. However, the ordered machinery and equipment were slightly delayed, so progress has been slower than planned. They are currently working day and night to catch up. The date of full completion will depend on the arrival date of the steel beam materials from overseas. ⑹ Tendering and construction have commenced for all station building projects along the entire line. Except for Xiaoshan Station, which started slightly later due to its connection with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the remaining stations are expected to be fully completed by around mid-July. ⑺ Track laying may need to be delayed until mid-June due to the late arrival of sleepers. Ballast has been contracted out to merchants in sections. As for the steel rails, they are being replaced on the Shanghai-Hangzhou section and transported in batches to Zhakou for transfer to various sections for use.

### Li Shizeng and Yu Hongjun Hosted the Former French Governor-General of Vietnam Yesterday

Vanini Scheduled to Go to Nanjing This Morning

According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Mr. Vanini, the former French Governor-General of Annam and current member of the French Chamber of Deputies' Socialist Party, is visiting China. Since arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he has received a warm welcome from various Chinese and French parties. Mr. Li Shizeng held a tea party yesterday afternoon, and Deputy Mayor Yu hosted a banquet for Mr. Vanini last night. The details are as follows:

Li's Tea Party

Due to his long-standing friendship with Mr. Vanini, Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Executive Committee, held a grand tea party at the World Society on Foch Road at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Vanini. Those invited included the French Consul-General, the Deputy Consul-General, the Director-General of the French Concession Municipal Council, the Commissioner of Police, and prominent Chinese and foreign figures such as Wu Zhihui, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Jingjiang, Song Ziwen, Zheng Yuxiu, Mrs. Wang Liangchou, Yu Hongjun, Geng Jiaji, and Xie Shou Kang, totaling about one hundred people. Mr. Li, accompanied by his two secretaries, Mr. Cui and Mr. Li, provided attentive hospitality. The guests first toured the Encyclopedia and browsed for about a week, then enjoyed refreshments, followed by a performance of Chinese music by the Datong Music Society for entertainment. The guests and hosts were extremely delighted, and the party ended around 7:00 PM.

Mayor's Banquet

Acting Mayor of this city, Mr. and Mrs. Yu Hongjun, hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Vanini at the Municipal Government Reception Center on Route Cardinal Mercier at 8:30 PM last night. Also invited were the French Consul-General Badas, Commercial Counselor Shao Xin, Military Commander Berthel, French Concession Commissioner of Police Faber, and Central Executive Committee member Li Shizeng, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Municipal Government Secretaries Geng Jiaji, Tang Shixuan, and others, totaling over twenty people. They thoroughly enjoyed themselves until around 10:00 PM.

Going to Nanjing This Morning

Mr. Vanini is scheduled to travel to Nanjing by train with his wife and secretary at 8:00 AM this morning. He plans to pay his respects to Foreign Minister Wang and relevant authorities and meet with the Ambassador of that country, Mr. Nacia, for discussions. After visiting Beiping, he will return to Shanghai to await his ship and travel to Japan before returning to France via the United States.

Vanini's Remarks

According to the Foreign Affairs News Agency, the former French Governor-General of Annam, Vanini, arrived at Longhua Airport at 8:40 AM the day before yesterday by plane from Hong Kong. Many important figures from both Chinese and French communities went to the airport to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Vanini stayed at the International Hotel. Ms. Rivieis, a female reporter from the French-language Shanghai Daily, visited him. The translated excerpt of their conversation is as follows: "In a living room filled with the national atmosphere of the English, the French and the Laoson, I (the female reporter from the French newspaper, speaking in the first person) went straight forward to talk to the former Governor Van. Because Mr. Vanini is tall, I was able to recognize him immediately in the crowded place. My first question was, 'Was the Governor's trip safe and sound?' Mr. Vanini immediately replied, 'In fact, this flight to Shanghai was not entirely successful because we landed in heavy fog, so we could see almost nothing of Shanghai in the air.' Mr. Vanini also said, 'I boarded the plane with my wife and Major Laulan at 4:00 PM last Wednesday (the 21st) from Wenzhou, but we suddenly received a report of bad weather in Shanghai and had to return. There was no train from Wenzhou to Shanghai, so we had to spend the night in Wenzhou.' Because of spending the night in Wenzhou, I was invited by a British Customs Commissioner in Wenzhou, and I was fortunate enough to meet an extremely old-fashioned Chinese person, which broadened my horizons because the Chinese people I had met before were either Europeanized or Americanized, but not purely Chinese. That night's conversation with the old Chinese man will be unforgettable for the rest of my life.'" It is reported that Mr. Vanini was previously a member of parliament, representing his hometown of Puy-de-Dome in the National Assembly for a total of twenty-six years, and from 1925 to 1928, he served as the Governor-General of Annam. Then I (the French newspaper reporter speaking in the first person) asked Governor Van when he left France and what his mission was in China. Mr. Vanini replied, "I left France last November because I was recommended by the French侨民 in Annam and Tokyo to serve as a representative to the Colonial Higher Council. Now I am traveling in the Far East as a representative to investigate the local economic situation. Regarding the economic situation in Annam, Mr. Vanini believes that Indochina has broken away from the trend of recession because rice and rubber have risen in price, so according to his speculation, a recovery of prosperity will be seen." Mr. Vanini also said, "After leaving Annam, I went to southern China, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong to inspect." According to Mr. Vanini himself, this is his first time visiting China, because when Van was the Governor-General, it was the era of the Chinese Revolution and civil war. However, according to his observations this year, everything in China has progressed, and construction is particularly significant. Today, traveling in southern China is almost as convenient as traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo. Mr. Vanini claimed that the purpose of his visit to China was to promote economic cooperation between China and Indochina, because China and Vietnam are adjacent to each other, and organized cooperation would be beneficial to both parties. After staying in Shanghai for a short time, I heard that he will go to Nanjing and Beiping to meet with the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Qiana. Afterwards, he will have to come to Shanghai again and stay for a week. After inspecting China, Van will return to France via Japan and the United States to report on his mission. According to Mr. Vanini, he will give a long speech the next time he comes to Shanghai.

### Baker Returns to Shanghai

Reports Severe Disaster in Sichuan

Mr. Baker, the General Secretary of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, has returned to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation plane the day before yesterday, having completed his trip to Sichuan to inspect the drought situation and work with the Sichuan branch to carry out relief measures. According to Mr. Baker's conversation with the reporter of the Xinxin News Agency, the disaster situation in Sichuan is extremely tragic. In addition to the emergency relief work, which is being actively handled by Zhu Ziqiao, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, work relief is also very important. When he was in Sichuan, he advocated to the Sichuan Provincial Government that work relief should be implemented as soon as possible so that the victims would not starve to death because they had work. Therefore, the Sichuan Provincial Government has ordered each county to gather young and strong victims to engage in the construction of ponds and canals that are beneficial to agriculture, with each owner providing food rations, or building roads and dredging rivers, with the local government providing food rations. The provincial government also allocated 2.39 million yuan to build the Jianqu section of the Sichuan-Hubei Road and the Luzhou-Longchang section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Road. This work relief method is the best way for local construction and disaster relief. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau has also decided to use 4 million yuan for work relief, which can probably be realized. However, I hope that the entire railway can start construction as soon as possible so that a large number of victims can get jobs to maintain their livelihoods. As for the food problem, there is also a regulatory plan. The provincial government will borrow 1 million yuan from the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to purchase and hoard sweet potatoes and rice in Chongqing and Wanxian for various counties to purchase. In addition, it will borrow 2 million yuan from the silver industry to set up a fund for fair grain sales in various counties. At the end of his remarks, Mr. Baker said that the committee is appealing to all parties, hoping that all sectors will donate generously. The American New York Famine Relief Committee is launching a fundraising campaign to relieve the Sichuan disaster. The Canadian Methodist Church is also expanding its fundraising and has remitted 5,000 yuan.

### First Mexican Envoy Ogarra Went to Nanjing Yesterday Morning

Mr. Ogarra, the first Mexican Minister to China, arrived in Shanghai from Japan a few days ago. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, he and First Secretary and Consul to Nanjing, Mr. Armodo, took the early express train to Nanjing. Mr. Zhang Mengling, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and others went to the station to see him off. After arriving in Nanjing, Mr. Ogarra immediately visited Foreign Minister Wang to discuss the presentation of credentials. He is scheduled to stay in Nanjing for several days. After meeting with Chairman Lin and presenting his credentials, he will return to Shanghai.

### British Tram Resumed Yesterday

Temporarily Not Entering the French Concession

The strike by workers of the British Shanghai Electric Tramways Company in the Public Concession has been resolved through the mediation of Du Yuesheng and Party and government agencies. Work has resumed yesterday morning. However, the issue of fee compensation with the French Water and Electricity Company has not been resolved, so tram services between the two concessions have been suspended. The details are as follows:

Party and Government Agencies Supervise Resumption of Work

The tram workers' strike was mediated the day before yesterday by Du Yuesheng in conjunction with representatives of the Party and government agencies. After agreeing on four measures, the workers were satisfied. Therefore, at 5:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhu Guilin, specially dispatched by the Social Affairs Bureau, and Lu Yinchu, dispatched by the Municipal Party Headquarters, went to the Bickell Road factory on Hart Road to supervise the workers. At 6:00 AM, all trams were dispatched and work resumed.

French Fee Compensation Not Yet Resolved

However, the British Tramways Company has not complied with the agreement to compensate the French Water and Electricity Company for the losses caused by the strike. Therefore, except for trams on routes 1, 3, 6, 7, 11, and 12 (tram cars) and route 20 (trolley buses), which operate on their original routes, trams on routes 2, 4, and 8 all stop at Waihongjing Bridge. Routes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 all stop at Avenue Edward VII. The section in the French Concession has been suspended. Routes 4, 5, and 18 in the French Concession turn around at the Bund and Avenue Edward VII.

Temporary Buses Connect Route 5

Because French Concession route 5 trams have stopped coming north, the British Tramways Company has drawn one tram from each route of the tram cars, named route 5, to run exclusively between the North Railway Station and Dongxin Bridge to connect with French Concession route 5 for the convenience of citizens taking the North Railway Station train. The two companies are currently in negotiations and may resolve the issue today to fully restore services.

Trade Union Sends Letter of Thanks to Du Yuesheng

The Preparatory Committee of the Three-District Water and Electricity Trade Union has reported the resumption of work to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for record. At the same time, they expressed gratitude for Du Yuesheng's efforts in mediation and financial assistance for losses, and sent a letter of thanks. Yesterday afternoon at 8:00 PM, the Improvement of Treatment Promotion Association of the trade union held a meeting to discuss the distribution of losses and the final accounting of income and expenditure during the strike, so that the funds can be distributed according to law after receiving the money.

### Emergency Meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors

Discussing the Yu-Fei Agreement, But No Announcement Was Issued

According to the China Press, the new directors of the Municipal Council have begun to work hard. The first regular meeting was held on Wednesday to consider the temporary agreement on road construction and donation collection outside the boundaries agreed upon by Deputy Mayor Lu Yu and Municipal Council Director-General Fessenden, but due to Japanese opposition, it was decided to postpone it so that the Japanese directors could carefully study the conditions. Yesterday (Thursday), the Municipal Council Board of Directors convened an emergency meeting. It was reported that Fessenden attended the meeting and personally stated the process of his conversations with Deputy Mayor Yu, so that the Board of Directors knew the truth. As for the meeting on this day, it was still like the regular meeting on Wednesday, but no formal announcement was issued. However, according to a certain person who is very close to the Chinese side, the China Press representative said that this matter has now become complicated. Judging from the current situation, because the Chinese municipal authorities recently came out to help the Municipal Council in the settlement of the Defeng Road case, they are unwilling to accept any suggestions that are slightly inferior to the conditions contained in this agreement. The Japanese are doing their best to oppose any limited agreement, that is, an agreement that only involves the collection of donations and leaves administrative matters such as medical and health matters to be handled later. Therefore, the position of the Municipal Council today is like being between water and fire, and its possible actions may be no more than one of the following two: one is to resume the strict attitude advocated by the Japanese, and the other is to express approval of the Yu-Fei agreement immediately and attach reservations, leaving the administrative matters that the Japanese particularly value to be resolved later. However, it is feared that the Japanese may not ease their attitude because of this reservation. This can be proved by the comments published in the Japanese newspapers in this city on Thursday. The translator notes that the China Press also has dissatisfied remarks about the Yu-Fei agreement and pointed out that the Municipal Council's decision to allow the Shanghai Municipal Government to come forward to resolve the labor disputes such as the tram strike is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging that the Shanghai Municipal Government has the power to negotiate all matters with the laborers in the concession. The recent successful negotiations between the Telephone Company and the Shanghai Power Company with the Shanghai Municipal Government have indeed damaged the Municipal Council's power over road construction outside the boundaries.

### Wang Jingwei and Others Arrive in Shanghai

Wang Jingwei and Wang Boqun left Beijing by night express last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Tan Zhen took the night train from Beijing the night before yesterday and got off at the North Station at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on Route Massenet to rest.

### Minsheng Yarn Factory Resumes Operations Yesterday

All Old Workers Enter the Factory

According to the Da Gong News Agency, the Shanghai Minsheng Yarn Factory, a Chinese-owned business on Robison Road in western Shanghai, temporarily closed down in the 24th year of the Republic of China due to the decline of the yarn industry and the inability to maintain operations. However, more than 1,600 workers in the factory suddenly became unemployed and their livelihoods were at risk. In order to take care of the livelihoods of all workers, Xu Caichen, the manager of the factory, has reorganized a new industrial company, leased the original site of the Minsheng Factory, its factory foundation, and machinery, and is actively preparing to open for business. It is now ready and announced the start of operations yesterday (the 23rd). All of the old 1,600 workers have also entered the factory to work. They expressed extreme gratitude to Mr. Xu Caichen for his consideration of the workers' livelihoods.

### Fisheries Syndicate Begins Lending Money

Ping'an Wheel Borrows 18,000 Yuan

Since the establishment of the Fisheries Syndicate of the Ministry of Industry, many merchants have gone to apply for loans. However, the loan procedures are very strict, and the investigation and review procedures are very solemn. Therefore, the only loan that has been approved so far is the mortgage loan for the Ping'an fishing boat. The boat is a new-style fishing boat equipped with a hand-operated net. Each time it goes out fishing, it can sell for more than 1,000 yuan when it is full. Now it is lacking circulating capital, so it has borrowed from the syndicate. After applying according to law and the syndicate sending people to investigate, the loan of 18,000 yuan was approved. The term is set at one year, and interest is paid monthly.

### Consular General in Singapore Orders Shi Zheng to Act Temporarily

Because Gao Lingbai Accompanied Kong to England

The United Federation of Chambers of Commerce in this city received a dispatch from the Ministry of Industry (Shang Zi No. 54528) yesterday, stating: "The April 9, 26th year telegram regarding the request to exempt the unified tax on cotton yarn has been received. We have received telegrams from the Chinese Yarn Mill Federation and the Hubei Provincial Chamber of Commerce, etc., and we have already consulted the Ministry of Finance for review and handling, and have also provided separate instructions.

### Sichuan Disaster Association Asks the Central Government to Allocate 15 Million in Public Bonds

To Rescue More Than 30 Million Disaster Victims in Sichuan Province. Representatives Schedule to go to Nanjing on the 26th to Petition the Central Government

The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association received a telegram from Fang Xu and others yesterday, stating: "Yang Cangbai, Xie Huisheng, Xiang Qingren, and all fellow villagers: The Sichuan disaster is extremely severe and rare in a century. You gentlemen are abroad and launched relief efforts, caring for your hometown, and we deeply admire your feelings. However, the disaster area is too large, and there are too many disaster victims. Although the central and local governments have allocated 2 million in bonds, it feels like a drop in the bucket, which is really difficult to help this extraordinary disaster. Chairman Liu has telegraphed the central government, requesting that about 3 million yuan in Class B Unified Bond tickets be exchanged for the reorganization of Sichuan financial public bonds, and that the remaining annual amount of about 4 million yuan from the Wu Jian tax increase be used as a reserve to issue 15 million yuan in Sichuan disaster relief public bonds. Xu and others have also submitted a request to the central government for review and reply. Now, we earnestly request you to appeal nearby and urge early approval, then the more than 30 million disaster victims will be endlessly grateful. Urgent words, and waiting for your instructions. Fang Xu, Liu Xianrong, Yin Changling, etc." The association also replied in a telegram, stating: "The Chengdu Sichuan Relief Committee to Fang Xu and others: We have received your telegram about requesting the central government to issue disaster relief public bonds. We are also actively carrying out this matter here and have appointed representatives to go to Beijing to jointly request with fellow villagers in Beijing. In addition to the debt amount and methods proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Government, the funds owed to Sichuan Road by the Ministry of Railways can also be transferred as a fund. I hope you will investigate and notify us of the results of the petition at any time. Sichuan Disaster Relief Association." We also learned that the association has appointed Xiang Yuren, Li Qingfan, Lu Yifeng, Tang Dean, and Mei Xinru to go to Nanjing on the 26th to petition the central authorities to quickly allocate 15 million yuan in public bonds to save the disaster victims.

The Canopus also carries 650 people, and the submarines and other small warships, such as aircraft tenders, minesweepers, and auxiliary ships, carry a total of 500 people. Currently docked in Shanghai are the submarine tender USS Black Hawk and eleven destroyers, so the US Asiatic Fleet is almost entirely gathered here.

The supply ship of the British China Fleet, HMS Medway, is expected to arrive in Shanghai from southern China this morning, accompanied by twelve submarines. The ship weighs 14,650 tons, and each submarine weighs an average of 1,475 tons and is equipped with one four-inch gun. They are all of the latest type.

### Tin Can Industry Guild Requests Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction

The Tin Can Industry Guild in this city telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday regarding the abolition of consular jurisdiction, stating: "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government: Since the opening of maritime trade, various countries have relied on their strong military power to force the signing of various unequal treaties one after another in order to achieve their political and economic aggression ambitions. The doors are wide open, sovereignty is lost, and the national situation is in danger. It is painful and angry to talk about. Among the treaties, the so-called consular jurisdiction is even more disrespectful of our country's national rights and damages our country's legal rights. Foreigners residing in China take consular jurisdiction as a talisman, and their actions are out of line, not subject to our country's legal judgments, and they are at large outside the law. The abuses are immense and have a huge impact. Now that unification has been completed and national power has been shaken far and wide, we should follow the teachings of the Prime Minister, display the spirit of revolution, and decisively abolish the consular jurisdiction of various countries in our country, and then abolish all unequal treaties. This is the fortune of the country and the blessing of the nation. We cannot express our urgent prayers in a telegram. Zhang Qingfa, Wu Renji, and Sun Wengang, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Tin Can Industry Guild, respectfully."

### Ministry of Transportation Rectifies Naval Officer Conduct

Orders China Merchants Bureau to Strictly Punish Wrongdoers

Since its reorganization in the spring of last year, the state-run China Merchants Bureau has repeatedly received announcements from President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and instructions from the Ministry of Transportation to thoroughly rectify and eliminate long-standing malpractices. Over the past year, illegal and unethical practices such as privately carrying goods, extorting alcohol money, privately collecting illicit fees, and engaging in corruption have been strictly prohibited. Whenever discovered, the offenders are severely punished according to the law. This has been implemented with vigor and without leniency, so employees dare not test the law, resulting in a significant improvement in conduct. Recently, it was discovered that employees in the purser's department and cargo handling department of a certain ship were privately carrying copper coins. The bureau, upon instruction from the Ministry of Transportation to strictly investigate, immediately dismissed the personnel involved in carrying private goods, as well as relieving the purser, Mr. Guo, and the cargo handling director, Mr. Xu, of their duties. Furthermore, the Ministry of Transportation discovered that a certain Captain Zhang and Chief Engineer Feng of a certain ship were engaging in high-interest lending, recklessly exploiting others, and falsifying service records to fraudulently obtain certifications. The ministry immediately ordered the China Merchants Bureau to dismiss these individuals and never rehire them. At the same time, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau was instructed to revoke all certifications obtained by these individuals. The severity of the measures demonstrates the commitment. It is also reported that the bureau attaches great importance to rectifying employee conduct. At the same time, it has also instructed employees to serve diligently and avoid such behavior, lest they bring trouble upon themselves.

### Land Ownership Certificates for Beiqiao and Dashu Townships

Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau Issues Public Notice Urging Collection

The Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau, since the beginning of this year, has been processing and issuing land ownership certificates. The work has been extraordinarily intense. Certificates have already been issued for the four townships of Beiqiao, Dashu, Zhong'an, and Yuqi in the first district. It is now learned that the bureau has set May 1st as the date to begin issuing certificates for the two townships of Zizhu and Sangang. The deadline for issuing certificates remains two months. A public notice was issued yesterday urging all property owners to bring their registration documents to the bureau within the prescribed time limit to claim their certificates and secure their property rights. The deadline for collecting custody fees for the ownership certificates for Beiqiao and Dashu townships expires on June 1st. After that date, the registration will be revoked. In order to ensure the security of property rights, the bureau, in addition to notifying each household, issues another public notice as a serious warning. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that the land ownership certificates for Beiqiao and Dashu townships in the third district began to be issued on January 2nd of this year. The deadline for issuing certificates was set for two months. Custody fees are collected after the deadline. If the certificates are not claimed after three months of collecting custody fees, the registration will be revoked. The land will be temporarily managed by this bureau. A public notice has already been issued. It has been found that a small number of property owners in the two townships have delayed claiming their land ownership certificates. The deadline for collecting custody fees will expire on June 1st. If the certificates are not claimed within this deadline, their registration will be revoked according to the regulations, and their land will be temporarily managed. This matter concerns the gains and losses of the people's property. In addition to copying and issuing notices urging the collection of certificates to the township offices for distribution and urging each household, it is imperative to issue a public notice urging property owners who have delayed claiming their certificates to come to the bureau within the prescribed time limit to claim their certificates and secure their property rights. Do not delay and cause harm."

### Reorganizing Aircraft Donations

Aircraft Donations Should Be Transferred on a Case-by-Case Basis During Changes of Personnel in Various Departments

The General Association of the China Aviation Construction Association has reported that whenever there is a change of personnel in various national departments, there are often cases of outstanding payments of aircraft donations. The outgoing official is deemed exempt because he has left office, while the incoming official claims that the matter was handled by the previous official and shirks responsibility. Such a situation has a significant impact on donation affairs. Therefore, a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan to issue a circular to all national departments stating that whenever there is a change of personnel, all aircraft donations that have been collected but not remitted, or that have been remitted but not cleared, must be transferred on a case-by-case basis and not overlooked. When the incoming official takes over, he must be responsible for thoroughly checking and clearing the aircraft donations handled by the previous official, or for recovering them. If there is any concealment or failure to report, it should be reported to the supervisor for verification and handling, and no cover-ups should be allowed, in order to protect public funds and benefit donation affairs. The request has been approved and forwarded to the National Government to issue a circular to all subordinate departments for compliance.

### Hua Yang Charity Reports on the Perilous Conditions of Disaster Relief Distribution

The Hua Yang Charity, located at 97 Renji Road, is deeply concerned about the increasing number of starving disaster victims in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, who urgently need rescue. It has joined forces with the China Jisheng Society to dispatch a large number of relief workers to the disaster area to provide aid in various locations, in order to quickly rescue the victims and prevent further deaths. However, the county is infested with bandits, making relief distribution extremely difficult. Fortunately, the relief workers, disregarding their own lives and hardships, have been able to actively carry out their work. We have received reports from Feng Yangshan, the director of the relief distribution, outlining the difficulties and dangers they face. Details are provided below. According to reports from the tenth relief team, including relief workers Mai Jinsheng and Fan Shoumin, the team is operating in high mountains and rugged stone roads. The disaster victims are extremely scattered, requiring them to climb over a mountain to reach just three or four households, holding onto vines and climbing on rocks. This is not only exhausting but also extremely dangerous, unprecedented in the history of relief efforts. However, considering the dire situation of the disaster victims waiting to be rescued, they dare not be afraid of danger. However, the number of disaster victims is large, making it difficult to distribute the relief funds adequately. They urgently hope for an increase in funds. According to a report from Feng Youmei of the fourth relief team, everywhere they go, they see disaster victims with emaciated faces. They are eating stone bran and elm bark to survive. It is truly heartbreaking. All along the way, they hear cries of sorrow echoing through the fields. It is unbearable to hear. Many disaster victims are suffering from abdominal distension. Many people who fled the famine are returning, and more aid may be needed. According to a report from Yu Jiashen of the thirteenth relief team, the area they are investigating is known for its barrenness, high mountains, and very little water. Since the great drought last year, nine out of ten households are empty. The situation is dire, with people selling their sons and daughters in increasing numbers. The number of people fleeing the famine is also increasing daily. When they hear that relief workers are coming, most people rush back. Most of the households they investigate are eating elm bark and stone powder to survive. The suffering is indescribable. Fortunately, there was rain and thunder yesterday, and the wheat seedlings may have hope. However, the roads are slippery and muddy, making the investigation even more difficult. It is also reported that, according to a letter from Director Feng, the number of disaster victims previously estimated was about 60,000. However, according to the households investigated by the various relief teams, the number exceeds one-third, totaling over 80,000. The original relief funds are difficult to allocate, causing great anxiety. It is hoped that all sectors of society will generously donate to provide universal relief.

Wang Xisheng, a local resident in his sixties with modest assets, residing at No. 3 at the end of Lane 60, next to the Shunchang pawnshop at Yangwei Bridge, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, had a mistress, a woman from Suzhou. Three years ago, she spent 80 yuan in a village in Chongming to buy a ten-year-old girl as a maid, named Donglan. Unexpectedly, the woman was naturally violent. Any slight displeasure would be followed by whipping, causing the girl's body to be covered with injuries. The night before last, due to a trivial matter, the girl was beaten with a mop handle until she nearly fainted. Unable to bear the abuse any longer, Donglan was sent out yesterday afternoon and took the opportunity to run to the constable and report. She was taken to the French police station. The girl's original introducer was summoned, and the Suzhou woman was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court. After an initial interrogation, she was released on bail pending further investigation.

Case Ruled to Be Under Incorrect Jurisdiction

The gist of her accusation was that the plaintiff met the defendant through a friend and began living together in September of the 24th year at No. 8 Renhuali, Sapo Sai Road. Later, they moved to No. 66 Pushi Road. At that time, Zhuang stated that he would marry the plaintiff as his wife. To reassure the plaintiff, he wrote a note on March 26th of the 25th year, stating that if he broke the agreement in the future, he would pay one thousand yuan. Now, the defendant has abandoned the plaintiff, so she filed a lawsuit, requesting that he be punished according to Article 229 of the Criminal Code, and demanded the payment of one thousand yuan as ancillary civil action. The case was heard by Judge Zhong Qing yesterday. Zhuang Dingxuan also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appear in court to defend him. He did not deny living with the plaintiff. After questioning by Judge Zhong, it was ruled that the crime occurred in the French Concession, so it should be under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Court. The case was ruled to be under incorrect jurisdiction.

### Congratulations to Qu Jinshan's Plaque, Where Did Chairman Lin's Seal Come From?

Mutual Blame Leads to Nowhere, Further Investigation and Interrogation Allowed

After being acquitted by the High Court, his fellow villagers presented him with a plaque with the inscription "Character of Pure Excellence" as a congratulation. Unexpectedly, below the inscription "Presented by the Yancheng Shanghai Native Association", there was a signature stating "Written by Chairman Lin" and the seal of the Central Chairman. Xue Zhao, the former plaintiff, sued Qu and Cao Dawu, who delivered the plaque, to the District Court. Prosecutor Lei charged them with forging documents. Yesterday, Judge Wu opened the court. Qu Jinshan did not appear due to illness and appointed lawyer Xue Lisheng to represent him. Cao Dawu claimed that it was a mistake made by the lacquerer.

Zhang, an old woman from Chongming, recently suffered a mental breakdown, let her hair down, ran to a large tree on the south side of the former site of the Jisi Fei'er Road Xinchang Silk Factory, suddenly hugged the tree, and shouted "Immortal Hu!" As more and more people gathered, she told the crowd that the immortal resided in the tree. As a result, hundreds of ignorant men and women gathered and burned incense to worship under the tree. The local Caojiadu Police Station, fearing disturbances, sent a large number of detectives to drive away all the incense burners. However, after the news spread, hundreds of people went to pray every day. There were often women with mental illnesses sleeping under the tree and shouting for Immortal Hu. The local police station, believing that such rumors were confusing the public, sent police to drive them away, but they kept returning and would not leave all day.

### Accusation of Throwing Bricks and Shooting Gun Due to Debt Dispute

Suspected to Be the Work of Zhu Baixiang, Prosecutor Jiang Investigates

Zhu Baixiang, a local resident who runs the Yuanfengshun Silk Factory at No. 1 Yongchangli, Zhongxing Road, owed Xu Yulun, a local resident residing at No. 55 Tanjiacai, Jiaotong Road, 5,000 yuan in national currency for a long time and did not repay it. Xu sued him in the District Court and obtained a judgment for execution. The Yuanfengshun real estate was sealed up three times for auction. This resulted in animosity. After a court hearing on the 19th of this month, at 8:20 p.m., Xu's house was first hit by a large brick, followed by a shot that broke the glass window. The police were immediately called to investigate. A neighbor, Wang Jiali, testified that he saw Zhu Baixiang and a large man standing in the dark. He had talked to them, but because he knew them, he did not want to interfere. Xu Yulun stated that his fence had been set on fire on the night of April 3rd, but it was extinguished by neighbors. On April 5th, he was instigated by hooligans to be beaten. On that day, he was still in court, and Zhu was not present, but many hooligans were waiting in front of the court, intending to harm him. After reporting to the judge, he hired a car through his agent, lawyer Zhou Yu, and escaped from the back door of the court. That evening, there was a shot and a brick thrown into the house, so he believed it was clearly Zhu's work. Furthermore, Zhu was sentenced to two months in prison and given a three-year reprieve on December 2nd of the 24th year for false accusation. He is still on probation and continues to commit illegal acts. Therefore, he presented the newspaper regarding the reprieve and requested the police to arrest Zhu and send him to the District Court. After investigation by Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang, the defendant was temporarily released on bail by Hongchang Silk Factory. Yesterday, Prosecutor Jiang personally inspected the situation at Xu's house for the sake of litigation.

### Shack Dwellers Petition Against Municipal Council's Deadline to Dismantle Sheds

All Sectors Pay Close Attention to This Matter; Hope the Council Does Not Act Too Radically

The 35,600-plus shack dwellers in the International Settlement, due to the Municipal Council's notice requiring all grass sheds within the Settlement to be completely dismantled before May 1, will inevitably have nowhere to live. They have sent representatives Tang Anping and others to petition organizations such as the First Special District Citizens' Federation and the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, requesting them to negotiate with the Municipal Council to postpone the demolition until affordable housing is built to provide accommodation. Although the Citizens' Federation and the Ratepayers' Association have forwarded letters to the Municipal Council for negotiation, the Council has not given a clear answer. It is reported that the Council seems to be determined to demolish the grass sheds and is preparing everything, intending to first demolish the grass sheds in the Yangtszepoo area in the coming days. The shack dwellers are extremely panic-stricken upon hearing the news and petitioned the Ratepayers' Association again the day before yesterday, requesting them to stop it. At the same time, they decided that if the Council insists on its own way and refuses to listen, they will all gather together and wait quietly to be trampled upon, preferring to suffer disaster together rather than see anyone's grass shed being demolished. Therefore, the situation is quite serious. All sectors are paying close attention to this matter and hope that the Municipal Council does not act too radically to avoid causing trouble.

### Li Guojie Claims to Have No Assets in Case of Recovering Funds from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Yesterday

Siming Bank Stock Issue; Court Instructs Plaintiff to Pay Attention to Investigation

The case of Li Guojie, former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, embezzling public funds of more than 1.2 million yuan, was heard by Judge Wang Fengqiu of the Execution Division of the District Court in the Fourth Tribunal at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon. First, Jiang Hechun, the lawyer representing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stated that Li Guojie mortgaged 50,000 yuan of Anhui Changhua Iron Mine stocks to Siming Bank for 30,000 yuan on November 25, 1935. How could he mortgage it after the incident had already occurred? Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications, asking Siming Bank to hand over the stocks for execution. At this point, Lu Shifang, the lawyer representing the defendant, stated that the mortgage was in 1931, and since the bank must renew it every six months, it has been extended to this day. However, he agreed to the execution of the remaining 20,000 yuan of stocks. At this point, Shi Naixiu, the lawyer representing Siming Bank, stated that the bank has priority over the stocks and cannot be executed. The judge said to Mr. Shi that last time your lawyer submitted a statement agreeing to hand over the case within five days. Statements made in court are to be held accountable. Now you suddenly oppose it and raise the claim of execution appeal, which is unreasonable. Mr. Shi said that a lawsuit for confirmation has now been filed separately. At this point, lawyer Jiang Hechun said that Li Guojie has not handed over any assets since June 6 of last year, which is obviously wrong. The defendant should be ordered to hand them over within a time limit. Li Guojie said that I really have no assets. If the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company investigates and finds my assets, they can be executed at any time. The court instructed to change the date for investigation and further questioning and instructed the plaintiff to also pay attention to the investigation.

### Fish Market Submits Request for Protection of Fry Purchase

According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce submitted a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating that the cultivation of fish fry is crucial to the production of river fish. Now, during the spring fish spawning season, it is appropriate to cultivate fish fry. The market, in view of this, plans to send personnel from the river fish wholesale to fish fry producing areas such as Jiangsu to purchase and transport them to Shanghai to increase production. Fry loading is not comparable to ordinary goods. Not only do they suffer extortion from hooligans along the port, which suddenly increases costs, but they also need to take fresh water for nutrition and care, which are both difficult. The transportation costs are also higher than other goods. From the place of production to the destination, several hundred yuan of miscellaneous expenses must be added. Without improvement, how can it be maintained? Therefore, it is proposed to separately request the relevant government offices to provide convenience to maintain the industry and increase production. It is appropriate to submit a report to your government, requesting you to order all counties along the river to provide protection and convenience to those purchasing fish fry passing through the border to maintain the fishery and emphasize production. It is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted.

### Jianghai Customs Limits Usage of Steam Whistles for Pu River Ferries

Due to frequent tragedies involving towboats in the Pu River, the harbor master of Jianghai Customs, Tebeck, has issued a notice limiting the usage of steam whistles on towboats to reduce the risk of collisions. The original letter is as follows: According to Article 12 of the Port Management Vessel Regulations and Article 28 of the Navigation Collision Avoidance Regulations, the horn sounds to be used by all towboats and small ferries within the harbor waterway of this port are limited to one short blast, two short blasts, and three short blasts, respectively indicating that the ship has now changed course to turn right, change course to turn left, and reverse quickly, so that the other ship coming can be aware and pay attention. There are no other signal regulations besides these. However, recently, the captains of the above-mentioned vessels within this port often drag out the short blast, which has become a habit. Even more extreme errors occur when they release these signals, not knowing that according to the regulations, it indicates that the ship is shifting direction. Their intention is to indicate the movement of the oncoming ship, which causes misunderstandings and leads to deviations. Incidents of two ships colliding with each other are frequent. Furthermore, the captains of ships in this port have a habit of releasing the horn again after receiving the reported sound of the oncoming ship to indicate a reply. In order to maintain navigation safety and the interests of each ship, all of the above-mentioned habits should be eliminated. The original regulations are hereby further clarified in three items as follows: ① Ships are only allowed to use one short blast, two short blasts, and three short blasts within this port. ② This signal is used to indicate that the ship releasing it has now shifted its direction, and it is not intended to indicate any action by the oncoming ship. ③ After receiving the returning horn sound from the oncoming ship, there is no need to release a horn in response. This letter is sent for your review, and you must explain the above points in detail to each captain and urge them to strictly abide by them to avoid repeating past mistakes.

### Xu Maochang Officially Assumed Office as Manager of Shanghai Branch of Farmers and Merchants Bank Yesterday

In order to expand its business, the Farmers and Merchants Bank specially hired Xu Maochang as the manager of the Shanghai branch. He officially assumed office at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than one hundred people, including Xu Chongzhi, Qin Runqing, Jin Tingsun, Yu Zuoting, and Zhang Fayao, went to congratulate him. It is reported that the bank received deposits of approximately one million yuan on that day, and more than one hundred new accounts were opened. Furthermore, in order to meet social needs, the bank will make significant improvements to small savings and credit loans.

### Report by Commander of British Forces in Shanghai Inspecting the Volunteers

Major General De Forest-Molett, commander of the British forces in Shanghai, submitted a report to Mr. Fessenden, chairman of the Municipal Council, after inspecting the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, stating that since the commander took office in August of last year, he had observed the evening drills of various units of the corps and was deeply satisfied with their achievements. The last time a large group of corps members held a mobilization exercise, communicating with the Russian team and Municipal Council police officers, the results were excellent. In the past few months, reserve members of the Russian team have assisted police officers several times, acting quickly and reliably. On April 10 of this year, all members held their annual drill, and their assembly and drills reached the highest level. This commander believes that the Volunteer Corps is well-suited to take action during an emergency, such as a real mobilization. After receiving the report, Mr. Fessenden sent a letter of thanks.

### Qian Yulin, Lu Quansheng, and Others Arrested for Forging Yellow River Lottery Tickets

Finance Office of Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission Sent Personnel to Shanghai to Accuse; Qian Confessed to Selling Forged Tickets for Food Due to Unemployment

The Finance Office of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission in Beiping, after the Yellow River flood, reported to the superiors and was approved to issue Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery Tickets, which were wholesaled by the manager of the Beiping Municipal Bank. Twenty-five issues have been issued to date, with monthly draws. Last month, counterfeit 24th issue winning lottery tickets were discovered on the market and presented for prize money. After a thorough investigation, it was learned that the agency issuing the counterfeit tickets was located at 94 Limei Road in the French Concession of Shanghai. The manager of the Beiping Municipal Bank reported this to the Finance Office of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, which in turn submitted it to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission and sent a letter, sending Xu Xingru (32 years old, from Anhui), a staff member of the Finance Office, to Shanghai to contact Director Li of the Shanghai Office of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission in the Xiahui Fang on Avenue Joffre. The day before yesterday, based on intelligence, he reported to the French Concession police and requested the arrest of the counterfeiters. Inspector Qian Chenglong, along with detectives Jiang Shangwen, Wang Rusong, Xu Daorong, Ma Yizhi, Wang Guanlin, and Jin Bingwen, rushed to the office of the Great China Record Company Mail Order Department at 94 Limei Road at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, arrested the owner Qian Yulin (36 years old, from Changshu), and copied the correspondence books and other items for purchasing lottery tickets by mail. They were taken to the police station. Qian admitted to selling the counterfeit lottery tickets and confessed that Lu Quansheng (39 years old, from Baoshan), who lived at 162 Dongzilaihuo Street, printed them. The detectives continued to arrest Lu. He confessed that he had printed the counterfeit tickets and that the printing plate was hidden at the home of Cheng Buyun at 118 Shaonian Road in the Chinese district. The detectives took Lu and went to Cheng's home with police detectives from the Municipal Police Bureau and seized five large lead plates and six small lead plates for privately printing counterfeit Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery Tickets, two bags of lead type, and six seals. The evidence is temporarily stored in the Municipal Police Bureau pending the filing of a document for transfer. At the same time, the detectives arrested Lu's younger brother, Lu Quande, and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Sun Pengxian questioned them. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, saying that the defendants are being detained and investigated for using counterfeit securities and requested a postponement until the investigation is completed and a lawsuit is filed. The detectives reported on the arrest of the defendants. Xu Xingru, the representative of the Finance Office of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, stated that after discovering the counterfeit tickets, he investigated and came to Shanghai to report the arrest to the police. Qian Yulin confessed that he originally ran a cigarette paper store but was unemployed and had no choice but to sell counterfeit tickets for food. Lu Quansheng confessed that Qian Yulin gave him a sample on the first of this month and asked him to print 1,000 copies for 70 yuan. It was only this one time. Lu Quande confessed that he had just come to Shanghai with his sister from the countryside yesterday and did not know about the printing of counterfeit tickets. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered a postponement for further questioning at 9:00 AM on the 30th. The defendants were detained.

### Spanish Civil War Affects Overseas Chinese Returning Home to Seek Refuge

Arrived in Shanghai on the Querrapoo Wheel; Another Group of Refugees Expelled from Japan

Our overseas Chinese in Spain, Xia Guoqing and others, returned home to seek refuge due to the ongoing civil war in Spain. Furthermore, Hu Heling and others, overseas Chinese in Japan, were recently expelled by the Japanese police authorities and returned home. The reporter from Datong News Agency provides the following details:

Overseas Chinese in Spain

Our overseas Chinese compatriots in Spain, Xia Guoqing (43 years old), Wu Zhongxing (37 years old), and Dong Chengru (32 years old), were doing business in the Spanish city. Since the outbreak of civil war in the country, they could not operate. They went to the Netherlands and then to Paris to seek refuge, requesting the Chinese Consulate in France to provide financial assistance. They arrived in Shanghai on the French mail ship Querrapoo the day before yesterday. Upon hearing the news, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of this city sent personnel to the pier to take care of them. Yesterday, they purchased tickets from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on their behalf and sent them back to their hometown of Qingtian, Zhejiang Province, on the Haiyan Wheel.

Overseas Chinese in Japan

Hu Heling (33 years old), from Ruian, Zhejiang, had lived in Nagasaki, Japan, for 12 years. Wu Anyin (55 years old), from Ruian, Zhejiang, had lived in Japan for 14 years. Hu and others were all peddlers. Recently, they were expelled by the Japanese police authorities. Yesterday, they arrived in Shanghai on the Aso Maru. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent personnel to receive them, contacted the Shen'an Public Bureau on their behalf, and sent them back to Wenzhou via the Sanjiang Wheel for transfer to their hometown.

### Women's Movement League to Recruit Members

The Chinese Women's Movement League held its first membership meeting of the year at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road last night. Thirty people, including Ms. Fang Jida, Lin Pengxia, Jiang Ying, Zhu Baoliang, and Zhang Heng, attended. After the meal, Wang Xiaoying was elected as chairman to begin the report and discussion items as follows: ① Liu Wang Liming reported that the association, formerly known as the Chinese Women's Suffrage Association, was established for more than seventeen years and has worked hard for equality between men and women in law and for national liberation. It has a glorious and brilliant history. In recent years, because women have already obtained legal equality, the members' meeting decided to expand the scope of the association's affairs, reorganize the Chinese Women's Movement League, and establish five departments: law, education, agriculture, industry, and family, to engage in practical work and fulfill the duties of citizens. ② Jiang Ying proposed that leading figures in the women's community should be invited to join as members. The association should expand its organization, openly recruit, and invite those present to be recruitment members for a period of two weeks, from the 27th of this month to the 10th of May. ③ The articles of association will be revised, and Wang Xiaoying and Wang Ruizhu will be responsible. ④ The location of the second meeting will be at the residence of Ms. Chen Zemin. ⑤ A new members' reception will be held on May 15, convened by Liu Wang Liming. In addition, many other proposals were passed. Finally, the chairman introduced Ms. Lin Pengxia to give a speech on her trip to the Northwest and her plans to sail to Singapore, India, and Xinjiang, which was earnest and touched the audience. The meeting ended at around 10:00 PM.

### Sato Emphasizes Expanding Economic Activities

— Fang

Yesterday, a Tokyo telegram reported that, regarding the issue of Japanese control over economic activities in China, although all parties in China hope to prioritize the resolution of political issues, financial capital and other sectors here do not seem to feel discouraged as a result. On the contrary, they hold an optimistic attitude, firmly believing that it is only necessary to follow the path of success achieved by Japan in its economic development in China in the past year or two, and that there is no need to work hard on political issues. Indeed, there are many ways to destroy a country, and there are also many ways for a country to bring about its own demise. Divided hearts, political corruption, following old ways in foreign affairs, frequent internal wars, and the willingness of traitors and puppets to be exploited by others—none of these is not a way to bring about self-destruction.

As for methods of destroying another country, it is either through forceful military occupation or through economic aggression, or by using traitors and puppets to first divide it. However, the use of traitors and puppets for division must also be backed by military force, as exemplified by the Spanish Civil War. Economic aggression, on the surface, seems more peaceful, but its effectiveness in destroying a country is no less than military force. One should not say that because others do not take drastic measures but use gradual and progressive methods, they have genuine sincerity for friendship.

Currently, the diplomatic authorities of both China and Japan are saying that they will adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit. This sounds plausible, but one wonders what the definition of so-called equality and mutual benefit is. For example, if A has something and B wants to seize it for themselves, A naturally refuses to give it. B then says, "Let's 'hahū' (a pidgin term implying shared benefits), let's divide it equally, so that you won't suffer a loss, and I certainly won't take advantage." This is also a form of equality and mutual benefit. Now, there are talks of joint ventures regarding certain railways, and proposals for cooperation regarding certain minerals. Many of our country's profitable undertakings are desired to be split evenly, with each side taking half, and they still proclaim to others, "This is equality and mutual benefit." Who would believe that?

Assuming joint ventures with foreigners, whether or not our sovereignty can be controlled by us is already a question. In the event of war, the other party could use the pretext of protecting mineral resources or railway lines to freely advance troops and station troops, while we would have no way to resist. Therefore, our insistence on resolving political issues as a prerequisite is indeed correct. If political issues are not resolved, we are unwilling to discuss any economic issues, and there is a reason for this. However, what needs to be done now, what needs to be clearly recognized, is that the land of North China is all our country's land, and the officials of North China are all officials appointed by our central government. Therefore, all political activities in North China must be carried out in accordance with the central government, and all kinds of illegal organizations and illegal agreements will never be recognized by the central government, nor will they be recognized by our people.

Furthermore, the telegram says that although all parties in China hope to resolve political issues as a prerequisite, the Japanese side is not pessimistic and only needs to follow the path of success achieved by Japan in its economic development in China in the past year or two, without the need to work hard on political issues. What important meaning does this statement have? What was the situation of Japanese development in North China in the past year or two? If we do not give it deep consideration and make adequate preparations, the consequences will be unimaginable.

### Dissection

— Ya Min

I have grown accustomed to corpses lying horizontally, and the smell of preservatives is also familiar to me. I no longer shed tears from the stimulation of the mixed scent of alcohol and "naphthalein," nor do I feel dizzy from prolonged stays in front of the corpse bed.

After two years of life in the dissection room, I now have a dull sense of smell and dull emotions. Guarding naked corpses is like guarding plaster human models; I feel no sadness or fear. Because as a medical student, my mind is filled with Latin terms and a purely material view of things; I lack the emotions of poets and children.

Dead organisms are viewed by medical scholars in the same way as inanimate objects. Therefore, a stiff corpse, the washbasin in the anatomy hall, and the dissection bed are all the same to me. We chat and laugh across corpses, and sometimes even cut off a piece of human flesh and send it to a companion: "Old Wang, have a piece of pork chop." We say such facetious things. We also turn off the lights in the anatomy room at night, and several of us guard the large jar of bones, reaching into the cold liquid to pull out a wet bone, and guess the name of each part of the bone, gambling for wine and food based on this.

Thus, the most ruthless doctors, educated by the most cruel methods, go out into society one by one, performing what the world calls the most benevolent career.

Tonight, because I was rushing to complete the dissection of the muscles on a thigh, when the university bell tower struck twelve, I was still lingering under the dazzling lights of the dissection room, and the silver scalpel was gliding over my pale gray, stiff muscles.

In the room there were me, over twenty complete corpses, and in the corpse pits there were some partially dissected limbs. In one corpse pit, many children's corpses were pickled in alcohol, and in another corpse pit there were many ugly heads, many bones, and many internal organs. This scene is quite terrifying to think about.

But I sat peacefully in the pile of dead people, pouring my heart into my work: only the sound of my breathing filled the spacious dissection room.

I was already skilled in the use of scalpels and dissecting knives.

## Page 18

It was not the first time I had lingered in this room until late at night, but today I had a strange feeling, and the scalpel felt unusually dull in my hand. I often recklessly damaged the textures of a nerve or destroyed the structure of a muscle bundle. Even the flesh-like, withered corpse in my hands, which was usually easy to peel away, became stubbornly tough tonight.

Astonished by my own feelings, I pondered repeatedly, and finally noticed the corpse I was dissecting.

It was a female corpse, and judging by the development of her bones and teeth, she must have been of an age to be charming when she was alive.

On her haggard corpse, I used the brush of imagination to depict her former glory.

Perhaps she was pure in life. Cherishing her own beauty, and cherishing her own love, not easily allowing a reckless young man to approach her, thus having the cold arrogance of a holy virgin. Or perhaps she was a glamorous girl, and frivolous young men wasted excessive enthusiasm or money, hoping to get half an hour of warmth by her side.

But here, she openly reveals her body in front of strangers without any cover, allowing frivolous fingers to caress her body, without shyness or refusal. This is something she never dreamed of in her lifetime.

Thus, a faint sadness crept into my heart, and I lowered my head, thinking of death, of what it would be like if I were lying here.

Even if I would not be used as a dissecting experiment like these unfortunate corpses, the tomb, with yellow earth plugging my mouth, allowing black snakes to nest in my heart, and earthworms to pass through my flesh and bones, would be even more unbearable then.

Gathering up my books and instruments, I hurriedly left the corpses and the room with my head lowered.

### Dog Meat

— Tian She

The cool pavilion at the bridgehead was often occupied by oil mill workers chatting. Early in the morning, everyone brought their bowls of porridge and dishes of soy beans for a communal meal. Some sat proudly on the wooden railings of the pavilion, some squatted by the stone tablet, and some leaned against the wooden post for tethering cattle. The oil mill owner would scold them every time he saw them: "Uncivilized lot, you don't sit at the tables provided, always eating in the open like famine refugees." But the workers' habit could not be changed by scolding. As soon as the boss turned his back, they would grumble, "Sit at the tables? There's no fish or meat to eat, just soy beans and vegetable soup every day...sitting at the tables is just for show!" In fact, the greatest convenience for them in eating porridge and rice in the pavilion was that they could chat without restraint.

During their after-meal rest and when they finished washing their feet at the pier in the evening, except when it was windy or raining, they would gather three times a day, like big bosses discussing something, with each person saying a sentence or two. However, sometimes they would laugh and shout at the top of their lungs, without the solemnity and seriousness of a real meeting. In their three sentences, there were two about "eating." Everyone seemed to be suffering from a "eating" sickness. It was no wonder, as in the oil mill, they only got their fill of rice porridge, and the vegetable soup was very bitter. On the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, they had meat, but the pieces of braised pork were barely the size of dice. Each person was barely given two pieces, and the small amount of oil could not even moisten their stomachs. Therefore, Tu Gen, the crooked mouth, often proposed eating a large pot of meat, the fattier the better, stewed with dried mussels and wood ear mushrooms. Chang Jiao Shunfu was the first to agree, "Rice builds strength, meat builds muscle. Our muscle isn't good; everyone's getting as skinny as monkeys!" But there was an immediate response from Ah You at the oil press, who always spoke with some venom:

"Eat meat, eat meat, the pigs haven't even been reborn yet. We only hear the sound of the escalator but don't see anyone coming downstairs. You can't eat meat just by talking; does money materialize? How much do you two have in your wallets? Let's eat dog meat!" These words caused a burst of bitter laughter among everyone. Even Tu Gen, the crooked mouth, and Chang Jiao Shunfu laughed. When the crooked mouth laughed, it felt both comical and pitiful. The laughter attracted Old Huang, who poled bean boats, ashore. Because he had good muscles and bones, everyone called him Iron Bones. "Iron Bones, do you want to eat dog meat? Hehehe..." Ah You narrowed his eyes, pursed his lips, and leaned against the stone pillar of the pavilion.

"Dog meat? Can't get it." Old Huang patted the bean dust off his shoulders. His cloth shirt was unbuttoned, and the afternoon sun shone on his broad chest. He continued solemnly, "Dog meat isn't as bad as pork; it's all lean, more fragrant than rabbit meat, as fresh and clean as beef, without the sour taste of horse meat. Moreover, eating dog meat has benefits; it helps heal injuries. Whether it's a beating, a crush, a contusion, or a puncture wound, it's more effective than injury plasters. Where do those who sell dog skin plasters get so much dog skin! If you don't believe me, you can try it. I used to row a ferry in Jurong Road. I crashed into a bridge pier and had a labor injury for half a year. It was healed by eating three large bowls of dog meat." He patted his chest again, telling everyone to look, as if his current strong body was entirely due to dog meat.

Everyone listened with rapt attention, as if they were all tasting the flavor of dog meat, fragrant, fresh and clean, without a sour taste. Especially Tu Gen, the crooked mouth, was deeply attracted by the claim that dog meat could heal injuries. He often suffered from chronic injuries. During the day, he worked hard, shouldering soybeans when there were soybeans to carry, and filling in as a helper at the oil press when there was a shortage of people, moving bean cakes, and operating the stone mill... He didn't feel much during the day, but it was terrible when he went to bed at night. His bones ached all over, his hands and feet burned, and his back sweated profusely. When it rained, he would get sick all day long. Although the pier didn't require loading or unloading cargo, turning over the bean stalks was doubly strenuous. The boss never went out to the streets, and the oil cake customers didn't come to him to discuss business. He spent his days supervising the workers' work, not allowing them to slack off even if their backs hurt, a life of no rest, a life that was killing him.

So, he purchased dog meat every day and finally revealed the point, eating dog meat doesn't need money. It is easy to do. Ah You was the first one to call people to eat dog meat. You can't run away. Everyone must limit him to catch a dog tonight to nearby villages. Tu Gen the Crooked Mouth is assigned to be in charge of firewood. Skinning and burning the dog is solely handled by Iron Bones. Everyone who wants to drink is in charge of buying alcohol. Everyone showed joy on their faces. There's meat to eat tonight to moisten the dry intestines. Dog meat is not as bad as pork. It will be stewed in a big pot. The oil mill cook is willing to lend a large pot. The earth will be dugout at the foot of the bridge. Ah You also dreamed of the good taste of dog meat but he feared being bitten by the dog, or any accidental happening. Tu Gen's crooked mouth was also filled with anxiety, "Will dog meat really be able to heal my labor injuries? Is there really such an effective remedy under the sky?" The cool pavilion seemed to be filled with the fishy smell of fresh dog meat….

### Postscript

Modern people, with their developed thirst for knowledge and the ever-improving transportation environment, travel in droves, making what the ancients called traveling ten thousand miles a lifelong ambition, truly incomparable to the past.

The joy of travel is universally understood, and its benefits to knowledge are that seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times. The resources acquired from books and the research of teachers and friends often resolve problems that lingered in the mind, with just a moment of personal observation bringing sudden realization. Gu Tinglin of the past wrote "The Book of Benefits and Harms of the World's Counties and Kingdoms," which spread throughout the land, and scholars know that it benefited from his personal investigation, serving as an example. As for its benefits to the body and mind, traveling with joy, holding a bamboo staff, can both strengthen physical fitness and broaden the mind. For spiritual cultivation, there is truly no better strategy. Sima Qian's literary brilliance, which amazes both the past and the present, was due to his travels through rivers and lands, which truly contributed to his accomplishments.

Since we fully recognize the benefits of travel, we should further promote the cause of travel, the progress of transportation and tools, the construction of the environment, and even the plans for guidance. We dare not lag behind others and are therefore testing its beginnings during this pleasant spring holiday. The compilation of this special travel issue, scheduled to be published in four installments, was undertaken with much effort and creation. We are grateful to the public and those directly and indirectly involved in the travel industry for their generous assistance, which has allowed us to fulfill our initial wishes. The results have even exceeded our planned expectations, which alone shows the increasing importance people place on travel. This is partly due to the public's continued support for this newspaper, and the staff of this newspaper will certainly work harder to further advance the effort in a reasonable period of time, in order to show a small token of our gratitude. With the compilation completed, we use these few words to express our gratitude and appreciation.

### A Visit to Lotus Cave

— Chen Xiaokan

Guizhou, located in the frontier, is characterized by layers of overlapping hills and mountains, with peaks rising into the clouds, and is known as the "Mountain Kingdom." The abundance of caves is unmatched by other regions. The most famous of these is Yangming Cave in Longchangyi, but in reality, the cave itself is not particularly remarkable. However, due to the extraordinary contributions of the ancient sage Wang Yangming to the enlightenment of the entire culture of Guizhou Province, the place became famous because of the person. In terms of scenic beauty, Lotus Cave, located in Puding County of the province, should be the top choice. However, due to its remote mountainous location, mixed with Miao and Yi ethnic groups, and the closed-mindedness of the local people, even though there is an ancient cave of tranquility and extraordinary beauty, few outside the region know about it, and it is only used as a haven from Qin Dynasty-like turmoil during times of war. Alas, the obliteration of scenic spots is truly regrettable.

Recently, I had the opportunity to travel to Guizhou, and having long heard of the beauty of Lotus Cave in Puding, I took the opportunity to visit and explore it, so that I could truly understand the true face of Mount Lu. Upon arriving in Puding, I walked about ten miles north of the city, and saw only steep ridges and hills, overlapping and protruding, with lush pines and cypresses, and thorns covering my ankles, creating an image of "I cannot go, brother." So, I gathered my spirits, turned mountains and ridges, crossed pine ridges, passed through dense forests, and crossed winding streams, finally reaching my destination. A small path in the weeds was almost indistinguishable. Guided by the local people, I finally reached the cave. The cave entrance was dangerous and narrow, curved and slanting, allowing only one person to pass through. Single file, we entered, and saw a high skylight, suddenly opening up into a wide and bright space. We crossed the stone arch bridge and went down the stone steps, about seventy-seven steps in total. The ground was extremely flat and wide, with a height of sixty meters. The four walls were all stalactites, shaped like arhats, Guanyin, fierce beasts, flying birds, pointed pagodas, and dragon pillars. The shapes and colors were endless, and the eye could not take it all in. To the right was a stone room, exquisitely built, tranquil and secluded. To the left was a tunnel, deep and unfathomable, sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes wide, sometimes narrow, winding to the fullest extent. Because of the darkness, it was necessary to light candles to proceed. At the end of the tunnel was another large cave, several times larger than the previous cave, with a height of two hundred meters. The ground sloped like a measure, with a difference in height of about fifty meters. At the high points, there were mounds of earth, with flowers and plants growing, and the fresh air was pleasant. At the lowest point, there was a subterranean stream flowing through, murmuring and gurgling, like the mutual striking of bells and drums. In the center of the cave, a stone spring dripped downwards, and at the point of dripping, there was a huge stone, large enough for four people to encircle, with edges around it capable of holding about five inches of water. We scooped it up and drank it, and it was clear and refreshing. There were also stone drums and stone bells, which rang when struck, and stone pagodas and stone dragons, which looked dignified. Inside the cave were dozens of smaller caves, some large, some small, some high, some low, some round, some square, some straight, some curved, some bright, some dark, some clear, some turbid, some accessible for exploration, and some only visible from a distance. On the walls of each cave, many Buddha statues were carved and painted with gold, with dazzling and shocking gold, silver, and ancient bronze colors, worthy of praise, and the exquisite artistry was especially precious. When leaving the cave, we encountered another stone room, which contained rubbings of calligraphy by famous figures from Chinese dynasties, as well as ink rubbings of Indian script, Greek Torcello script, valuable cultural relics, and many other antiques. I and others have a passion for ancient things and entered to browse, spending an hour of mental and visual effort. In summary, what we gained was like a drop in the ocean. After returning from the visit, I wrote this to record my experiences and urge the authorities of the province to pay attention and promptly conduct surveys and repairs, in order to protect the scenic spots.

### Travelogue of Beiping

— Liang

Of the many places I have visited, none can compare to the beauty of Beiping, which is filled with the wonderful atmosphere of oriental tranquility.

Unlike the social life in metropolitan cities, where there are only cinemas and dance halls, in Beiping, one can spend a little money, take a rickshaw, and go along Chang'an Street to Zhongshan Park, where one can admire the red and green flowers and absorb the warm, fragrant, and fresh air.

East of Zhongshan Park is the Taimiao (Imperial Ancestral Temple). There, in addition to beautiful scenery, one can also see things used by the imperial priests of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

A few dozen steps east of the Taimiao is the Museum of Antiquities, which contains everything from pottery from the Shang and Zhou dynasties to stone tablets, weapons, and coins used by previous dynasties.

Across the street from the bustling Dong'an Market, passing through Xihua Gate, is the Hall of Three Greats, whose architecture is very magnificent. All the buildings are decorated with carvings and paintings, especially with soaring dragons and flying phoenixes, as if they were living creatures.

Not far away is the Forbidden City, whose architecture is even more magnificent. The palace also displays valuable antiques.

Jingshan (Prospect Hill), or Coal Hill, is near the Forbidden City. From this small hill, one can see the entire city, or the lake scenery of Beihai and Zhongnanhai.

A dozen steps further, and Beihai is in front of you. The White Pagoda of Beihai is reflected in the mirror-like lake. Sometimes, a gentle breeze blows, and there are also gentle white waves splashing. In the height of summer, red and white lotus flowers float in the lake, interspersed with a few small boats, which is truly indescribably beautiful, comparable to Hangzhou's West Lake.

In the south of the city, the famous scenic spots are the Temple of Heaven and the Altar of Agriculture. Here, in addition to displaying the excellence of Eastern architectural technology, one can also admire the lush, beautiful forests and the quiet surroundings. Anyone who has been to Beiping has visited these places.

There are even more scenic spots outside the city. A few miles outside Xizhimen, the winding and undulating West Hills come into view. Upon reaching Haidian, there are many magnificent palace-like buildings towering in front, standing majestically on the banks of the lake surrounded by weeping willows. This is Yenching University. The famous Summer Palace, or Longevity Hill, is located to the northwest of the school, forming a distant view.

From Qinglong Bridge, heading northwest, one can reach scenic spots such as Baozang Temple, Black Dragon Pool, Hot Springs, and Great Awakening Temple. Walking southwest, one can reach scenic spots and historical sites such as Jade Spring Hill, Reclining Buddha Temple, Azure Clouds Temple, Fragrant Hills, and Eight Great Sites. Especially Fragrant Hills, not only has beautiful scenery such as colorful flowers and mountains rising into the clouds, but also a refreshing climate, making it a good place for healing. Villas, hotels, and sanatoriums have been built all over the mountains, and tourists flock here in the summer, making it worthy of being called Beiping's Lushan.

The March sun was warm enough to make the withered peach and willow trees grow tender green leaves again. The soft branches of the weeping willows hung low by the water's edge, and the long leaves gently brushed the surface of the water, as if a long-haired young woman was arranging her morning makeup in front of a mirror. The bright red and pure white peach blossoms filled the branches, like a girl wearing a crown of flowers. Adorable little birds sang crisp and melodious songs of spring on the branches, as if telling people to enjoy life while they could.

Having already tired of Hangzhou, we were not very interested in it, so we thought of going to Shaoxing. We set off early in the morning after a hearty breakfast at the hotel. Because the Qiantang River Bridge was not yet completed, we had to cross the river at Jianggan. Usually, it's a free ferry, but cars had to pay a fare of one and a half dollars. We reached the Xiaoshao section of the highway, and the road surface was unexpectedly flat and wide. Having traveled all over the roads of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, this was the most satisfying.

As we passed Xiaoshan, the scenery became even more beautiful. On both sides were willows, growing like emerald canopies. The soon-to-be-ripe wheat bore fat ears. Golden rape flowers were interspersed with pink clover flowers and white bean flowers, forming a natural pattern. A river, neither wide nor narrow, had boats unique to the Shaoxing area, propelled by both hands and feet, coming and going on the river, and the ancient stone bridges further enhanced the beauty of the scenery.

The car drove very fast, and in less than an hour we reached Shaoxing. Turning left again, it was not long before we reached East Lake. The car stopped by the bridge and could not pass. We left the car and walked across the stone bridge. I was thinking that such a small place, without strange peaks or strange rocks, would surely disappoint us, but the reality was the opposite of my expectations. Walking into the gate, the houses were quite dilapidated, with walls eroded by wind and rain, and incomplete windows, clearly a discarded relic. Perhaps people are now slowly paying attention to it, so it is being repaired. The newly made windows are still white and have not been painted, and the walls and pillars have also been plastered very smoothly, but some are still covered with the ink treasures of unknown writers. Although it is so dilapidated, the scenery here made me cry out in admiration. The place is so secluded, like a paradise, with antique scenery that makes you feel like you are in another world. Opposite is a wall-like rock formed naturally. The small lake surface is as calm as a mirror. Winding creepers hang quietly over the water, and delicate wisteria, like bunches of grapes about to ripen, hang in clusters, emitting an intoxicating fragrance. Suddenly, a long, large fish leaped out, and a splash of water suddenly appeared on the still water, slowly growing larger and returning to calm. After watching for a long time, we hired two small boats and slowly rowed to the opposite rock face. The inside was just enough for a boat to pass through. On both sides are high cliffs.

, mountain spring water, drop by drop, falling into the water, the boat could no longer move forward, turned back and rowed across the small bridge, headed towards another rock, discovered a naturally formed cave, the boat passed through this cave and came out on the other side, we then abandoned the boat and went ashore, our stomachs were rumbling with hunger, but we were reluctant to leave this place, so we asked them to prepare some snacks, bought a few catties of aged wine, and comfortably enjoyed the scenery, canceling our planned trip to Lan亭 altogether, it was not until it was time to return that we started our journey back, but I still cannot forget this secluded paradise.

### Yandang Guide

— Dao Rong

"Trying to describe the Dragon Pool is difficult, it's a waste to live without visiting Yandang", from these two lines of poetry, one can know just how good the scenery of Yandang is.

"Scattered, it is Yandang, gathered, it is Yellow Velvet, carved, it is the Mountain Gorge, one of China's four wonders", this is Wu Ya Lao's critique of Yandang after visiting it, establishing it as a nationally famous mountain. From these four criticisms, we say that Yandang is one of China's four major famous mountains, and this is not an overstatement.

"Spring travel to Tiantai, autumn travel to Yandang," this is commonly known among experienced travelers, because the strange peaks and rocks of Yandang are countless, and there is often fog in spring and summer, and the peaks and ridges are often blocked by white clouds, it is better to go in the autumn when the sky is clear, you can see clearly; it is said that there are horse leeches in Yandang, which sting people painfully, but they are gone in the autumn, so autumn travel to Yandang is the most suitable, in fact, horse leeches have long been extinct, not a problem, there is a lot of rain in spring and summer, hanging waterfalls and flying streams, Yandang is not unsuitable for spring. Because the beauty of Yandang lies in the majestic and strange peaks and ridges, but its ubiquitous flying waterfalls are indeed unmatched in other famous mountains in the country. Yongjia Commissioner Xu Pan Yun said "Yandang has a thousand waterfalls after a rain", so Yandang is not only known for its peaks, but also for its waterfalls, saying that Yandang is a mountain and water cave, this is not an empty word, so those who want to see mountains and water, those who want to see strange peaks and unique waterfalls, must visit Yandang, Member of the Central Committee Jing Hengyi came to Yandang for a visit the year before last and said, "Yandang in spring is better than Tiantai", this shows that Yandang is not only suitable for autumn travel, but also especially suitable for spring travel, now is a great season for spring travel, so I will talk about Yandang travel guide.

Yandang is named after a bird, located in Yueqing County, Wenzhou, eastern Zhejiang. In the Tang Dynasty, Arhat Nuojutuo was the founding ancestor. The Song Dynasty moved south, and tourism began to flourish. At that time, there were eighteen famous temples in the mountains, and the grandness can be imagined. The circumference is about 360 li, with 120 peaks, divided into six major areas: East Inner Valley, East Outer Valley, West Inner Valley, West Outer Valley, South Pavilion, and North Pavilion. The East Inner Valley has the most scenery, almost everywhere, as if entering the Shanyin Road, the eyes are overwhelmed. Yu Dafu said that the sedan carriers pointed out the sights all the way, making it difficult to remember, almost wanting to beg the sedan carriers to stop talking, which is true.

The beauty of Yandang's landscape does not need much publicity, it is already well known, but most tourists, although they have the interest, are hesitant because they are unfamiliar with the route and the situation in the mountains is unclear. It is said that many people arrive in Hangzhou and want to visit Yandang, but end up turning back halfway due to a lack of information, which is a pity. I am relatively familiar with the situation in Yandang, so I am very willing to tell the public what I know, and if it can help tourists in any way, I will be very happy.

To visit Yandang, you can go by both land and water. For water travel, you can take the Yili ship that departs from Shanghai's 16th Wharf every Thursday afternoon to Wenzhou, and you can cross the river to the mountain on Saturday morning, which is very convenient. The Yili ship is very clean; it is more comfortable than taking a car, or take the China Merchants' Haiyan ship to Wenzhou, the time can be shortened by one-third due to direct sailing, otherwise take a ship to Haimen in Linhai County, and then take a car to the mountain, which is also very convenient. In short, if you don't use your own car or chartered bus, it's more comfortable to take a ship than to take a public bus. There are two routes for land travel, one is to take a car from Hangzhou via Chuzhou and Wenzhou to Yandang, or to take a train from Hangzhou to Yiwu, then take a car to Chuzhou and Wenzhou, and then to Yandang, this is the western route. The other route is to go from Hangzhou to Taizhou and then to Yandang, this is the eastern route. If tourists have their own cars or rent a small chartered car, they can reach Yandang in one day from Hangzhou, but they have to cross the river four times in Hangzhou, Linhai, Huangyan. Pay attention to the tide in Linhai, otherwise you may have to wait three to five hours for the tide to rise, which tourists should pay special attention to, the other ferries are not a problem. If you come from the western route, you should also pay attention to the tide in Wenzhou and Qingjiang, and the ferry fee for private cars is one or two yuan each time, and if it is after 6 pm, the fee will be doubled. If tourists also want to visit Tiantai, it is best to stay in Tiantai for one or two days, so that there will be no difficult problems on the way. As for the road, the road surface has been repaired very well recently, and driving is not inconvenient, but the facilities at the stations along the way are simple, which is relatively inconvenient for female guests, but the Highway Bureau is currently trying to improve it, and it will soon be able to meet the hopes of travelers.

In addition to not knowing the route, tourists are also concerned about the safety on the way. In fact, there is no problem on the eastern route, so you can rest assured. The situation in the mountains is even more difficult for outsiders to understand. There are not only no thieves, but also no gambling, no hooligans, and no beggars, so Zhen Zhaoying said that Zhejiang has only Yandang, which is a clean land, really like a paradise, and the Management Committee's planting of peaches along the way seems to be creating a paradise as well.

After briefly introducing the route to the mountain and the situation in the mountains, I must also briefly talk about the food and lodging in the mountains. The current main entrance is Xianglingtou. After arriving at the destination, tourists can choose to stay in hotels or temples. There are currently two hotels. Yanshan Hotel is near the station. The rooms are relatively high and spacious, but the room rate is slightly higher, divided into two types, two yuan or one yuan per person. The food is divided into two corners and three corners per person. As for the Yandang Hotel, it is located at the entrance of Lingyan Temple. The highest room rate is eight corners per person, which is suitable for economical mountain climbers, but the sanitary facilities are relatively poor. If you stay in a temple, Lingyan Temple is the first choice, because the scenery of Yandang is concentrated in Lingyan, with peaks and waterfalls, which can be said to be a great achievement of mountains and rivers. The second is Lingfeng Temple, because it is newly built, followed by Jingming Temple, the house is not good, followed by Guanyin Cave, mostly inhabited by pilgrims, followed by Beidou Cave Baiyun Nunnery, etc., among which Lingyan Jingming, now have new sanitary equipment, unfortunately it has been destroyed by the immorality of tourists, now the flushing toilets are being reinstalled, and soon the Lingfeng Temple's porcelain bathtubs and flushing toilets can also be installed. In addition, Longhexuan in Dalongqiu, Yanyingshanfang in Xishiliang, and Lingxiaoguan in Sanshuiyan can all eat and stay, but at most only a dozen people can stay each night, so those who travel together must plan carefully after arriving at the mountain to avoid temporary difficulties.

After talking about the food and accommodation situation, of course, we must talk about the transportation tools in the mountains. In addition to sedan chairs, there are also rickshaws in the mountains, about thirty or so, when the car arrives, tourists can take them in order, because the rules here require you to follow the order, and you are not allowed to rob, just like the rickshaw drivers at the Xixing Wharf in Hangzhou, quite orderly. The sedan chairs are all made of rattan, and the style has been improved many times. First, it was the rickshaw style, but now it has been greatly improved and is quite practical. Chen Cheng and Zhang Daqian and others came to Yandang one after another and believed that there was no such good sedan chair in the famous mountains of the country. Ningbo Commissioner Xu Shida called the sedan chair a "wishful sedan chair" and a "universal sedan chair", and other general travelers also gave high praise.

Secondly, we must talk about the tour itinerary in the mountains. The tour methods can be divided into radial type and circumnavigation type. The radial type is to go out from the residence and return on the same day, the advantage is that the food and accommodation are more comfortable, but the disadvantage is that the tour time is more limited. The circumnavigation type is to stay anywhere and not return to the original residence. The advantage is that there is plenty of time to visit, and the disadvantage is that the food and accommodation are more difficult. The two programs each have their own advantages and disadvantages, which depends on each person's temperament to determine their direction. If you want to set a tour itinerary, then Jiang Shunan's list is very useful for reference, but the current situation is different. My idea is that if you visit for one day, you can visit Lingyan, Lingfeng, and Dalongqiu. On the second day, the first day, go to Sanshuiyan Longliu Xianshengmen Nange Zhenji Temple Lingfeng Chaoyang Cave and other places. On the second day, first go to Xishiliang and then see Meiyu Waterfall Luodai Waterfall Dalongqiu Yanzhi Waterfall Lingyan Temple Jingming Temple Three-fold Waterfall and other places. If you can visit for three days, then on the first day, go to Beige to see the great waterfall under Hanling and the Xianqiao Xianren Cave Beauty Jishifeng along the Xunling Road. On the second day, go to Nange all the way. On the third day, go to the Xiwai Valley all the way. In short, Lingyan Temple is the best place and should be put to the end, so that it is like watching the final show, which is more interesting, otherwise the farther you look, the more scattered it becomes; the interest in visiting the mountain will be reduced a lot. If you want to climb to a high place, you can go to Yanhu or Baigangjian, which is also good, but it is not easy to allow time.

People who climb mountains are always disappointed when it rains, but Yandang is not. Sunny days are good, but rainy days are also good, because the waterfall is large when it rains. It is also interesting to watch the waterfall instead of the peaks. Xiao Zheng came to visit Yandang and said, "It is interesting to see famous mountains in the rain," which is very reasonable. I often say that Yandang is not only suitable for autumn travel, but also suitable for travel in all seasons. Even snow travel, wind travel, fog travel, dawn travel, moonlit night travel, and even dark night travel have various wonderful things. The best time is between autumn and winter, after a heavy rain, on a moonlit night, the taste is even more endless.

Some people say that the strange and numerous peaks of Yandang may not be as good as Guilin, but that is not the case. Although Guilin has many strange peaks and rocks, it has no flying waterfalls and cliffs, so compared with Guilin, Yandang may be better. Ma Junwu, who grew up in Guilin, has a poem: "How is Yandang Stone, very similar to Guilin Peak." According to his opinion, at least Yandang and Guilin can be tied.

If tourists are interested in visiting Yandang, if there is anything they don't understand, they can inquire with the Mountain Management Committee at any time. They welcome tourists and will give satisfactory answers.

### Yandang Itinerary

— Y·K·

The Shenbao on April 13th has a Yandang travel plan. Now, the along-the-way situation is briefly described below. Traveling from Shanghai to Yandang is no less than several hundred miles, and travelers often suffer from the long distance. It is provided for reference for those who are interested, and they can enjoy the famous mountain. This group departed from Shanghai at 3 pm on the afternoon of the day, and traveled the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway for about 7 hours before arriving in Hangzhou. The car went straight to the Xin Xin Hotel. Because the hotel is located in the West Lake, it is quiet and beautiful, and the price is not high. We had dinner and stayed overnight in the hotel. The next morning, we got up at 7 am and set off for Nanxing Bridge to cross the Qiantang River. Each car was charged one and a half yuan for the ferry fee. We passed through Xiaoshan Shaoxing on Xiaoshao Road and turned north at Shaoxing Station, passing through East Lake, which is also a famous scenic spot in Shanyin. After a brief tour, we went to Caoe Station, turned south into Shengxin Road, and went to Sheng County. We then went east to Xinchang. The road to the east is to Fenghua, and the south is Xintian Road (Xinchang to Tiantai). At Xinchang Station, we asked the villagers for boiled water and filled our stomachs with the prepared dry food. After passing through Tiantai, we added gasoline and went to Linhai. There was a section that passed through a mountain ridge, which was about four or five hundred feet high. At Linhai, we crossed the Lingjiang River, which flowed very rapidly. The ferry could only carry one car at a time, and it took half an hour for a round trip. Now there were five cars, which took two and a half hours. In the future, if we use a steamboat to cross the river, the time can be saved a lot. We then went to Huangyan, where we needed to cross the river again. The Didi Bridge was actually a pontoon bridge, which could only be used by pedestrians and not cars. This time we had more experience in crossing the river. Each time after two cars crossed the river, they separated and went ahead, so that the time was saved a little. When we passed through Zeguo County, it was already dark. We arrived at the Water Rise Ferry and crossed the river again. The water here was shallow, so we didn't need a rudder and used a pole instead, so the boat didn't take up space and could carry two cars at a time. The distance between the two banks was shorter, and it could be solved in about ten minutes. From here to Yandang Mountain, it was only two miles. We arrived at our destination around 9 pm. This route from Shanghai to Yandang is 372 miles long.

On the left of Dengwei Mountain, there are four ancient cypresses, named Qing, Qi, Gu, and Guai (clear, strange, ancient, and monstrous). The "clear" one stands straight and is as lush as a green canopy. The "strange" one lies on the ground in three curves, shaped like the character "之". The "ancient" one has a bald and wide top, half-rotten like a palm. The "monstrous" one has a spiral body, with branches and trunks all like that. It is said to be from before the Han Dynasty.
