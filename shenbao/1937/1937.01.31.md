### Wang Asks for Special Amnesty for Those Who Attempted to Assassinate Chairman Lin. Case Handed Over to the Judicial Yuan

Wang Originally Asked the Government to Allow for Self-Renewal

[Nanjing] Wang Zhaoming, a member of the National Government, submitted a request to Chairman Lin on the 29th, asking for a special amnesty for the people involved in the Zhang Yuhua assassination case, in order to show the government's virtue of leniency and allow people to renew themselves. It is now learned that Chairman Lin of the National Government ordered the original submission of Wang on the 30th to the Judicial Yuan for review. The original submission of Wang is recorded below: "Respectfully submitted, Zhaoming was assassinated at the Central Party Headquarters on November 1, 24, suffering three gunshot wounds. He has been entangled in illness and disease, first going to Shanghai for treatment, and then going abroad for recuperation. He has never inquired about the details of the assassination. Knowing that the case has been investigated and tried by the court, he has not expressed his opinions rashly. It is now heard that the case has been adjudicated and the defendants have been convicted. Zhaoming believes that he has no private enemies in his life, but in recent years, he has been in charge of administration, during which time the internal and external troubles have been severely pressing, and his talent and ability have been insufficient to deal with them. The difficulties and twists and turns therein are not easy for everyone to understand. If this has caused misunderstanding, leading to violent acts, although it cannot be excused legally, it is understandable emotionally. May I ask for your understanding and grant a special amnesty to the defendants, in order to show the government's virtue of leniency and allow people to renew themselves. The decision comes from your wise judgment. I am extremely anxious and respectfully submit this to Chairman Lin of the National Government. Wang Zhaoming, a member of the National Government, respectfully submits this." (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Tokyo Correspondence

### Contradictions of Japan Demonstrated in the 70th Diet (Part 1)

— Nanyun

㊀

"Danger! Danger! National livelihood in danger!" This is the cry of the Japanese public, represented by the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun in the "Today's Problem" column.

Amidst this cry of national livelihood in danger, the 70th Japanese Diet opened—on January 21, 1937.

The political battle that had been brewing for a long time between the government and political parties was now entering a decisive phase. Because both sides were taking a hard line, the atmosphere on the first day of the Diet was extremely tense. Due to this tense atmosphere, the government requested the Emperor to issue an edict, suspending the Diet session for two days starting from January 21st.

During these two days of Diet suspension, the movements of the Japanese political situation were limited to the following three points:

㊀ The government's collective resignation. ㊁ Dissolution of the Diet. ㊂ The political parties' surrender to the government.

Based on the current attitudes of the Seiyukai (currently the second largest party in the Diet, holding 172 seats) and the Minseito (currently the largest party in the Diet, holding 205 seats), it is virtually impossible for the political parties to surrender to the current government (surrender to a future government is possible). As for dissolving the Diet, although the military has such a resolution, it is difficult to do so now because the right-wing new party has not yet been formed, and the Diet system cannot be abolished immediately. Therefore, based on the current trend, it seems that the cabinet's collective resignation is the most likely scenario.

However, whether it is the cabinet's collective resignation or the dissolution of the Diet, the political parties' victory is very slim. Judging from Japan's current political situation, the succeeding cabinet will inevitably be a powerful cabinet that is closer to the military and has a more fascist leaning. It is obvious that it cannot be formed without this.

㊁

After the February 26th Incident [February 26 Incident, 1936, a failed coup attempt by radical elements of the Imperial Japanese Army], the prominent characteristic of Japanese politics was the opposition between the political parties and the government. The political parties aimed for a "constitutional norm," while the government was backed by a radical military. In this Diet session, on the surface, it was a battle between the political parties and the government, but in essence, it was a struggle between the political parties and the military. However, the power of this struggle was very limited. Therefore, on the first day of the Diet, Minister of the Army Terauchi and Seiyukai Diet member Hamada Kunimatsu had a very heated verbal battle. The Minister of the Army said that Hamada Kunimatsu insulted the military, and Hamada Kunimatsu asked the Minister of the Army to cite the facts. When Hamada Kunimatsu was responding, the Seiyukai's seats repeatedly applauded and cheered for encouragement. As a result, the Minister of the Army was filled with anger and proposed the dissolution of the Diet at an emergency cabinet meeting at 6:30 PM that day.

Other events, such as the commotion in the Diet when Foreign Minister Arita gave his speech and the Seiyukai Diet member shouting "Shameless" during Maba Tsangtian's speech, are all worth noting in the history of the Japanese Diet.

Originally, since the May 15th Incident [May 15 Incident, 1932, Tokyo, assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi], Japanese political parties have already entered a period of decline. Parliamentary politics is a product of capitalist society. In the rising period of capitalism, political parties are at their peak in every country. When capitalism enters a period of decline, political parties cannot but enter a downward or revised period. The Japanese political parties at the current stage are taking the path of decline. If they want to change from downward to upward, they must have a great force. But the current Japanese political parties lack this power.

㊂

Because the political parties are heading towards decline, a special phenomenon of the two major political parties uniting to fight for their own interests is manifested in this Diet session. During the "Saito Cabinet" and the "Okada Cabinet," the positions of the Seiyukai and Minseito were different. What about this time? Although there are still differences in the strengths and weaknesses of their proposals, they are generally starting from the same goal of striving for constitutional politics. This is also a rare event in Japanese history.

However, both major political parties represent the interests of Japanese capitalists and landlords. There are differences in the investment sectors between capitalists, and there are differences in interests between capitalists and landlords. Therefore, there are many contradictions within the political parties.

The different attitudes of the Seiyukai and Minseito in the proposal to amend the tax system are obvious. The Seiyukai advocated abolishing the transaction tax and modifying the property tax. The Minseito, however, advocated modifying the transaction tax and abolishing the property tax. This is enough to illustrate the contradictions between the two parties. Originally, the Seiyukai relatively represented the interests of commercial capitalists and landlords in Japan at the current stage (Seiyukai members mostly come from various localities), while the Minseito relatively represented the interests of industrial capitalists in Japanese capitalist society at the current stage (Minseito members mostly come from major cities). A huge budget is a threat to the national livelihood. It is very reasonable for the public's voice to be conveyed through the political parties, and for the political parties to fight with the government by means of this voice. However, from the attitude of the Minseito and Seiyukai opposing the tax system this time, it can be seen that they cannot represent the interests of the Japanese public. Their main purpose is to reduce the burden on some capitalists and landlords and shift this burden to the public as "consumers."

Also, because the Seiyukai still represents the interests of landlords, and at present, landlords are also feeling the oppression of some capitalists, the rhetoric of some Seiyukai members is more forceful and fierce than that of the Minseito. However, because of this, the Seiyukai members who are close to the munitions industry are even more actively carrying out the movement to organize a new party.

In addition to the Minseito and Seiyukai, there are also the Social Democratic Party (18 seats), the National Alliance (12 seats), the Showa Association (25 seats), and the Tokyo Association (9 seats) in the Diet. The Social Democratic Party's remarks are relatively representative of the public, but they only represent it verbally. The Social Democratic Party has rarely taken practical fighting actions. As for the National Alliance and the Tokyo Association, the fascist colors are very strong, and they are also opposed to the political parties. However, the reason they oppose them is that they feel that the government's capabilities are insufficient.

㊃

Since December, the voices emanating from within the political parties, as well as the strong stance of the political parties in the past week, have been so strong that even Hirota, who is "skilled in diplomacy," was unwilling to visit the presidents of the two parties before the Diet session opened (according to Japanese tradition, before the Diet session opens, the Prime Minister must visit the presidents of the two major parties to consult their political views. However, this time, it was formally passed at the cabinet meeting on the 19th that the visits would be stopped). Although this can also be said to be the government's counterattack against the political parties, the strong attitude of the political parties cannot but be said to be a good phenomenon that Japanese political parties have had in recent years. However, from this strength, the internal weakness of the Japanese political parties can also be seen. Since the budget was passed by the cabinet meeting, the prices of goods in thirteen cities including Tokyo in December were about 10% higher than in 1931 (the year of the Manchurian Incident), which is a very serious matter for the general lower classes. The people's grief supports the waist of the political parties, and the momentum of the political parties is naturally very strong. This is the strength of the political parties. However, because the current Japanese political parties cannot truly represent the public, the political parties cannot but give way to the government and compromise with the government in many places. In the current Japan, the enrichment of national defense and the improvement of national livelihood are in fact incompatible. The political parties representing capitalists and landlords, for their own interests, of course, have no choice but to prioritize national defense and sacrifice the public.

### Nation and Democracy

— Tao Xisheng

For several years, I have not discussed practical politics. The crisis of the nation and the people over the past few years has again made me constantly have an urgent expectation for the nation. This expectation is from a long-term perspective and is from a quiet observation of the general trend of practical politics. This expectation is not from the perspective of daily work in practical politics, nor is it treating hope as fact.

Internationally, China's future is in line with the international peace route of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Under the watchful eyes of strong neighbors, China has no way but to oppose aggression and expect peace. Needless to say, this peace must be achieved through the defense of armaments and international integration. The United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries have been working hard for world peace for more than a year and have been contacting peace-loving countries or those resisting aggressors for the sake of world peace. There is no doubt that China's future is consistent with them. The relationship between China and the United Kingdom and China and the United States has clearly made great progress over the past year or so. Only the concrete political and economic relationship between China and the Soviet Union remains to be promoted. But in terms of the overall international situation, the rapprochement between the two countries is not a problem.

Due to the consistency of the international anti-aggression route, China's diplomacy has been globalized. If a country wants to add troops to China, there is a substantial possibility of causing a world war. The powerful country that wants to add troops to China has its own great concerns.

China's national wall against foreign countries is becoming stronger day by day. And this solid national wall can enable China to gain some victories in diplomacy. I think this year's diplomacy can be strengthened, and I expect China's diplomacy to be strengthened.

Looking back at domestic politics, although there are many serious internal conflicts that occur from time to time, and there are many people who want to use the serious situation in diplomacy and the national movement to cause internal conflicts, these waves only make those who work in practical politics temporarily excited and discouraged. From the perspective of the general trend of politics, the future of politics is democratic unity.

Unity can strengthen the national wall. Division can destroy the Great Wall of the nation. This is as obvious as it can be. At a time when foreign troubles are enough to destroy the entire nation, revolutionary or government-overthrowing movements are absolutely not tolerated by the people. All the nation's political, economic, and military forces should be concentrated under the government in order to resist foreign aggression.

In order to concentrate the people's strength, the government must adopt democratic methods and systems. The gradual trend of the political system towards democracy over the past few years is undeniable. The unity and progress of various factions within the Kuomintang, the entry of non-party talents into the cabinet, and the preparation for the convening of the National Assembly are all signs of democracy. If it wants to concentrate the people's strength, it is possible and should be possible for the government to follow this existing trend and go further.

Democracy has a certain limit. The government will not and cannot grant opposition parties the freedom to commit acts of violence to overthrow the government. If opposition parties advocate their freedom to commit acts of violence to overthrow the government, then the government's strength will inevitably be used more in stabilizing internal unrest. If we want to jointly consolidate the national wall, opposition parties must sincerely guarantee domestic peace.

However, with the strengthening of the nation's resistance to foreign aggression, the limits of domestic democracy will inevitably be expanded. At a time when the nation is resisting foreign aggression, no opposition party has the possibility of exerting its means of vying for power. At the same time, the government's need for concentrating the people's strength is also increasingly urgent.

Therefore, China's political trend towards democracy is also expanding day by day.

### Hitler Announces Domestic and Foreign Policy to the Reichstag

Never to Invade Belgian and Dutch Neutrality, Economic Self-Sufficiency Without Seeking Foreign Aid, Hoping for Cooperation to Resolve the European Situation

[Berlin] Today, in a speech commemorating the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, Führer Hitler announced the nationalization of the Deutsche Bank and the national railways, and explained Germany's departure from the restrictions of Paris. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Hitler said, "I solemnly announce the cancellation of all clauses in the peace treaty that attribute the responsibility for the European War to Germany. The era that shocked us has come to an end. I consider the restoration of the glory of us Germans, such as the restoration of conscription, the creation of the air force and the new navy, and the occupation of the Rhineland area, to be the most thrilling work of my life. I do not take credit for the above matters; I should thank the power of God for restoring the glory and integrity of our country." (Reuters, 30th) Hitler then elaborated on Germany's relations with various foreign countries, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) Between Germany and France, there is no longer any object that could cause disputes between the two countries.

(2) The German government should declare to Belgium and the Netherlands that Germany is prepared to always guarantee that Belgium and the Netherlands are regarded as neutral countries and will never invade them.

(3) British Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, hoping that Germany would abandon its self-sufficiency policy and seek economic cooperation with other countries. We now reply to this: Germany does not intend to abandon the Four-Year Plan. Germany cannot rely on the aid promised by foreign countries to determine its future. Germany can only rely on the products that can be sold domestically and abroad.

(4) Germany believes that Bolshevism is a scourge of the world. We have tried various methods to avoid this scourge. If we conclude a new treaty with Soviet Russia in the future, it will be of no value to us. To say that the National Socialist Germany can take on the responsibility of protecting Bolshevism is simply inconceivable. As for accepting the assistance of Bolshevik countries, it is not what we want. (Havas, 30th)

Hitler then outlined the following eight-point policy for stabilizing the overall situation in Europe:

(1) The stability and order of the domestic political and economic situation.

(2) Various peoples respect each other's major interests.

(3) The League of Nations must be reorganized to become an institution of evolving ideas.

(4) International regulations must be formulated on the basis of absolute equality.

(5) Adopt a realistic view of arms limitation.

(6) If irresponsible international parties are allowed to continue inciting without being stopped, peace can never be maintained.

(7) European problems can only be solved to the extent possible. Germany hopes to have a close friendship with Italy and is willing to

Eliminate all obstacles in the future so that the same close relationship can occur with other countries.

(8) When discussing the issues of ethnic minorities, national honor must be respected. Hitler acknowledged that when Germany occupied the Rhineland area, Britain did its best to avoid the tension of the situation. Hitler concluded by saying, "We are willing to solve several of these problems in the most natural way, and that way is to actually build good relations between our country and its neighbors. Now that Germany's sovereignty and equality have been restored, we will never sign treaties that are not commensurate with our national honor, because such treaties cannot be preserved in the end. Peace is the most precious treasure for us."

Hitler also said, "Germany and other countries are on an equal footing, and they are aware of their responsibilities in Europe and will cooperate sincerely to solve various international problems." (Reuters, 30th)

### Summary of Hitler's Speech

Deutsche Bank and National Railways Nationalized, Reichstag Passes Extension of Dictatorial Powers for Four Years, Orders Germans Not to Receive Nobel Prizes

Hitler further said that it is regrettable that outsiders mistakenly believe that Germany intends to isolate itself voluntarily. It must be known that no country in the world will express political disinterest in the affairs of other countries. If the world is as small as today's Europe, then the above situation should be even more certain. Hitler then told the Reichstag that Germany is extremely friendly with Poland, Austria, Italy, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, and Spain. The conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany clearly shows that Germany has no intention of voluntarily falling into isolation.

Hitler also said, "I solemnly declare that there is no point of contention that can be imagined between Germany and France, and we have guaranteed to the silver countries of the Netherlands and Belgium that we will recognize their permanent neutrality. Germany has no intention of abandoning international cooperation economically. In the past few months, the speeches of most politicians have given the world the impression that the whole world will provide economic assistance to Germany, but the Germans have stubbornly refused it. Since 1932, Germany's overseas trade has not decreased, but has increased. However, I believe that, apart from a new basis for the exchange of goods, I do not believe that there is more lasting economic cooperation. The world's economy has been affected by the biological confusion of various countries and their interrelationships. Germany has no responsibility for this. It must be known that the world economic panic in 1932 was indeed greater than today. The implementation of Germany's Four-Year Plan is indeed a last resort. I will never build a future country on the guarantees of foreign politicians or international aid, but must rely on the true facts of production."

Hitler regretted that Britain did not adopt its current attitude towards European unification earlier, and then said that the Treaty of Versailles no longer exists. Hitler continued, "From Eden's point of view, Bolshevism may be a matter of setting up its base in Moscow, but from our point of view, this doctrine is a great disaster and has tried to make our country desolate like Spain."

Hitler said that he had made three specific proposals to limit armaments, but all were rejected. The most important of these was that France and Germany should reduce their armies to 300,000 men, and Britain and France should reduce their air forces to an equal level. Germany and Britain should conclude a naval agreement. Only the last move has been accepted. Eden is convinced that each country should only have the armaments necessary for its national defense. Eden has consulted with Moscow on the realization of this good doctrine. May I ask what guarantees he has obtained from Soviet Russia? Now only Germany can determine its own defense needs. Italy and Japan share this view. If all of Europe can know this, then he will be even more pleased. Germany welcomes the reduction of tensions in the Mediterranean as a result of the British-Italian agreement. This move can at least limit the disasters descending on Spain. Germany has no other relationship with Spain other than cultivating economic relations. Eden has called this kind of economic relationship important and beneficial. Recently, there has been a tendency to say that Germany's sympathy for the Spanish National Army has a colonial plan. It must be known that Germany has no colonial demands on countries that have not occupied German colonies. Dividing the world into parts that should and should not be divided cannot solve the colonial problem. If the League of Nations regards judging the current state of the world and abandoning it permanently as its work, it is better to accept controlling the trend. The continued existence of Germany depends on its realization that it must consider the necessary reforms regarding relations between countries and implement them. Germany should not require colonies for military use, but will only provide them for economic use. Our country is densely populated, and colonial demands will eventually be made.

Hitler then mentioned domestic affairs, and after briefly mentioning the political achievements of the past four years, he asked the public, "Who can compare today's Germany with the Germany of four years ago?" He also asked whether the world has ever had such a thorough revolution, even if most former political civil servants were not disturbed, and then granted their greatest enemies with pensions. He continued, "However, our policies have never been greatly used in other places. A few months ago, a very prestigious Englishman protested to us the detention of one of Moscow's greatest criminals in a concentration camp. I don't know whether he protested the burning and killing of tens of thousands of men, women and children in Spain. Judging from the fact that 100,000 people were killed in the Spanish civil war, we also have the right to do so if the National Socialist revolution killed 400,000 to 500,000 people. Guiding one's own country to know that the greatest and most solemn work for human beings is to preserve the race. This is indeed the first time in human history. This is not to guide countries into disputes, but to guide countries to a common understanding for the first time. This also prevents Jews from trying to wear the masks of pure and good middle-class society to split and control other nations. The National Socialist revolution is so great that its spiritual foundation has not been understood by the world to this day. There has never been a society more glorious and beautiful and with true democracy than National Socialism. National Socialism makes it possible for every child to reach the position of leader of a country.

Four years ago, the number of unemployed people in the country reached six million, and farmers seemed to be on the verge of extinction. Today, you should admit that the promise to save them has been fulfilled.

Hitler then mentioned the unspeakable catastrophe Germany suffered in its two thousand years of history, and criticized the self-help behavior of economic commentators, who began to talk about the collapse of the economy when they saw the devaluation of a banknote. He acknowledged that he was not an economist and had never been an idealist. Hitler continued, saying that saving our people is not a financial problem, but a job problem. On the one hand, we should guide the existing labor force, and on the other hand, we should reclaim land and develop mining profits. If the leaders of economic life cannot do these things, then the state has to take steps to give the existing artificial labor a considerable employment. In addition to ordering 12 million man-hours to be abandoned every year, the state can do everything possible. The Four-Year Plan is indeed the most solemn expression of this kind of orderly guidance of our economic life, and it enables workers who are separated from the arms manufacturing industry to obtain permanent jobs. There is still a lack of trained workers in many industries. This is one of the most noteworthy things in Germany's great economic development.

Hitler's speech lasted for two hours and then he ordered Germans not to receive Nobel Prizes. Then, the Reichstag unanimously passed a bill to extend Hitler's full powers for four years. This bill was proposed by Interior Minister Dr. Frick, and was passed by the members with a show of hands, and General Göring was elected to continue to serve as speaker of the Reichstag. It is said that Hitler's speech was completely drafted by himself, and even his most trusted confidants did not participate in the discussion. Hitler suffered from a sore throat during his speech and coughed several times. Hitler declared to the Reichstag that he often did not seek the opinions of the former enemy countries on certain necessary measures, or even notify them, but implemented them decisively, because he thought that this would make it easier for the other party to accept them. (Reuters, 30th)

[Berlin] The German people are enthusiastically celebrating the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, and an atmosphere of eager anticipation is spreading across the country. By noon, the atmosphere had changed dramatically. Shops and agencies stopped working to prepare to listen to Chancellor Hitler's speech to the people of the country in front of the seven hundred and forty-one members of the lower house.

The giant eagle representing German sovereignty is the most obvious decoration, and its outstretched wings have a distance of eleven meters from one end to the other. (National Telegraph, 30th)

### Soviet Russia Sentences Thirteen to Death in Party Prison

Radek and Two Others Sentenced to Ten Years' Imprisonment, Defendants' Faces Are Pale When Hearing the Verdict

A total of seventeen defendants were sentenced, thirteen to death, three to ten years' imprisonment, one to eight years' imprisonment, and four were exempted from the death penalty. The four who were exempted from the death penalty were Radek, a famous Soviet Russian political commentator, former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Sokolnikov, Anor, who had served as a Hollywood movie actor and admitted to attempting to assassinate People's Commissar Molotov, and Storolov, who had been sent to Germany to hire German experts to work in Soviet Russia. The above three defendants were all sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, and Storolov was sentenced to eight years.

About 400 people from the public were present in court. The defendants were escorted to the court to hear the verdict with dejected expressions. When Chief Judge Ulri rushed to the seat, the entire court stood up to pay their respects. Ulri then began to read the verdict. The defendants all stood still. When they heard the sentences imposed on them, their faces were pale. The crowd was eager to know Radek's fate. When the judge announced the names of the defendants who were found guilty, the atmosphere in the court became tense. After the judge announced the adjournment, the defendants were escorted out by armed guards. The audience in the court cheered and expressed satisfaction with the verdict. Although this case has attracted public attention, there are no people gathered outside the court waiting for the announcement of the verdict. People were generally surprised that Radek and the other four were spared the death penalty, because it was originally thought that none of the defendants would be spared the death penalty, especially since Radek never pleaded for mercy, and it was even more expected that he would die without a doubt. The court's reasons for sparing Radek and the other four from the death penalty are that although they committed various crimes, they did not actually participate in genuine terrorist activities. It is also heard that the property of all the convicts will be confiscated. (Reuters, 30th)

### Verdict Main Text

[Moscow] The main text of the verdict states that, in 1933, according to the direct instructions of Leon Trotsky, a public enemy banished abroad in 1929, a secret anti-Soviet Trotskyist parallel center organization was successfully established in Moscow, alongside the so-called "Trotskyist Terrorist Center" existing at the time, including Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Smirnov. This organization included the defendants in this case, Pyatakov, Radek, Sokolnikov, and Serebryakov.

According to the instructions of the public enemy Leon Trotsky, the anti-Soviet Trotskyist parallel center formulated its main tasks as overthrowing the Soviet regime, restoring capitalism and bourgeois rule, and applying sabotage, subversion, espionage, and terrorist activities to destroy the economic and military power of the Soviet Union, promote armed aggression against the Soviet Union, and aid foreign aggressors to defeat the Soviet Union.

In complete accordance with this main task, in addition to the public enemy Leon Trotsky abroad, the anti-Soviet Trotskyist parallel center, represented by Radek and Sokolnikov in Moscow, held negotiations with individual representatives of Germany and Japan. When the public enemy Leon Trotsky negotiated with Rudolf Hess, one of the leaders of the German National Socialist Party, he promised that after the Trotskyist government seized power due to the defeat of the Soviet Union, it would sacrifice the Soviet Union by granting political, economic, and territorial concessions to Germany and Japan, even ceding Ukraine to Germany, and the Primorsky Krai and Heilongjiang Province to Japan.

At the same time, the public enemy Leon Trotsky also promised that upon seizing power, he would abolish state-owned farms, disband collective farms, abandon the national industrialization policy, and restore capitalist relations within the Soviet Union. In addition, the public enemy Trotsky also admitted that in peacetime, especially when aggressor nations launched armed aggression against the Soviet Union, he would use methods such as spreading defeatist propaganda, carrying out sabotage, subversion, and espionage activities, to help these aggressor nations as much as possible.

The members of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist parallel center, Pyatakov, Radek, Sokolnikov, and Serebryakov, carried out the instructions of the public enemy Trotsky, launching sabotage, subversion, espionage, and terrorist activities. These instructions were repeatedly received personally by Radek and Pyatakov during a meeting with the public enemy near Oslo in December 1935. To direct anti-Soviet activities locally, local Trotskyist center organizations were also established in several major cities in the Soviet Union, most notably the Western Siberian anti-Soviet Trotskyist center in Novosibirsk, which was formed under Pyatakov's direct instructions, including the defendants in this case, Muralov, Boguslavsky, and Drobnis. The sabotage and subversion work in the industrial sector, especially in enterprises of national defense importance, as well as in the railway sector, was carried out by the defendants in this case in accordance with the direct instructions of the public enemy Trotsky, as well as the tasks assigned by the representatives of the German and Japanese intelligence agencies, and was jointly and directly participated in by these representatives. These activities were aimed at disrupting production plans, reducing the quality of output, and organizing arson and explosions in factories, factory departments, and mines, as well as organizing train derailments and destroying railway vehicles and tracks.

When organizing this subversion work, the defendants' starting point was based on the instructions of the public enemy Trotsky: "strike forcefully in the most sensitive areas," supplemented by the instructions of Pyatakov, Livshitz, and Drobnis: do not hesitate to harm human lives, because "the more sacrifices, the better, as it can arouse the workers' resentment."

The verdict continues to detail the crimes committed by the defendants Taiqi Ke and Puxin in the chemical industry under Pyatakov's instructions, the crimes committed by the defendants Drobnis, Norkin, Hestov, and Stoylov in coal mining and the chemical industry of the Kuznetsk Basin under the instructions of Pyatakov and Muralov, and the sabotage and subversion work carried out by the defendants Serebryakov, Boguslavsky, Livshitz, Knyazev, and Tulok in the railway sector. The defendant Knyazev, under the orders of Livshitz and a representative of the Japanese intelligence agency, caused multiple derailments of cargo, passenger, and military trains, resulting in casualties. Pyatakov and Serebryakov, under the direct instructions of the public enemy Trotsky, prepared to carry out various subversive activities in important industries related to national defense and on the most important railways during armed aggression against the Soviet Union. Norkin, under Pyatakov's instructions, prepared to set fire to the Kemerovo chemical plant when war broke out. Knyazev, under Livshitz's instructions, accepted the orders of a representative of the Japanese intelligence agency to try to bomb railway structures, burn military supply depots and military grain supply stations, and destroy military trains in the event of war, and even openly spread bacteria to poison Red Army troop transport trains, military grain supplies, and sanitary stations, causing severe infectious diseases.

In addition to subversion and sabotage work, the defendants Livshitz, Knyazev, Tulok, Stoylov, Hestov, Lataike, Puxin, and Grashi, under the orders of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center, also collected extremely important state secret information and transmitted it to representatives of German and Japanese intelligence agencies. The defendants Lataike, Puxin, and Grashi were connected with the representatives of the German intelligence agency, Meierlovich and Lenz, and provided them with special secret materials on the situation and work of the chemical industry from 1935 to 1936. The defendants Hestov and Stoylov colluded with the representatives of the German intelligence agency, Sibesdo, Feilesa, Floren, Shamairleg, and others, and provided them with secret information on coal mining and the chemical industry in the Kuznetsk Basin. The defendants Livshitz, Knyazev, and Tulok regularly supplied a representative of the Japanese intelligence agency with absolute secret information about the technical situation, counter-mobilization preparations, and troop transport of the Soviet railways.

The anti-Soviet Trotskyist center, under the instructions of the public enemy Trotsky, also organized many terrorist groups in Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, Rostov, Novosibirsk, Suchi, and other Soviet cities, preparing to assassinate party and government leaders Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Zhdanov, Kussir, Aksilbosdigev, and Beria. Several of these terrorist groups (Moscow, Novosibirsk, Ukraine, and the Transcaucasus) were directly directed by Pyatakov and Serebryakov. In mid-August 1934, when Molotov was going to the Kuznetsk Basin, Hestov, under Muralov's orders, attempted to assassinate Molotov. For this purpose, he sent Anold, a local Trotskyist terrorist, to try to cause an accident to the car Molotov was riding in. In addition, Hestov, under the orders of Pyatakov and Muralov, plotted to assassinate Aksil, the secretary of the Communist Party's Western Siberian Regional Committee, while Anold, under Hestov's instructions, attempted to assassinate Ordzhonikidze.

The verdict continues to prove the crimes committed by each defendant individually and the criminal provisions under which they were charged. According to these provisions, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union sentenced the defendants Pyatakov and Serebryakov to death by shooting for acting as members of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center, organizing and directly directing treasonous espionage, subversion, sabotage, and terrorist activities.

The defendants Muralov, Drobnis, Livshitz, Boguslavsky, Knyazev, Lataike, Norkin, Hestov, Dunlok, Puxin, and Grashi, who acted as organizers and direct executors of the above-mentioned criminal activities, should be sentenced to death by shooting.

The defendants Sokolnikov and Radek, who acted as members of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center and were responsible for its criminal activities, but did not directly participate in the organization and execution of subversion, sabotage, espionage, and terrorist activities, should each be sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. The defendant Anold should be sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. The defendant Stoylov should be sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. Sokolnikov, Radek, and Stoylov should each be deprived of their civil rights for five years.

The public enemy Leon Trotsky and his son Sedov were expelled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and their Soviet citizenship was revoked by a resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union on February 20, 1932. Their direct command of the treasonous activities of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center has been confirmed by the confessions of Pyatakov, Radek, Hestov, and Muralov, the testimony of witnesses Lom and Bukharov, and the evidence in this case. They should be immediately arrested and handed over to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union for trial if they are found within Soviet territory.

### The Japanese Hayashi Cabinet Can Be Formed Today

Army Recommends Sugiyama as Successor to Minister of the Army, Togawa Shinji Appointed Chief Secretary

[Tokyo] General Yoshijika Kawashima visited General Hayashi, the head of the cabinet formation, at the cabinet formation headquarters at 2:35 PM today. He later told people that General Hayashi had already decided on the policies and political outline of the new cabinet. He also had the opportunity to review them and said that they seemed to be based on the fundamental principles of the Army authorities' new proposals. Negotiations with cabinet members will begin soon and it is expected that the cabinet formation will be completed tomorrow. (Domei dispatch on the 30th)

[Tokyo] The chief secretary of the Hayashi cabinet has been tentatively decided as Togawa Shinji, the former director of the South Manchuria Railway and the current president of the Kyodo Koeki Company. (Domei dispatch on the 30th)

[Tokyo] The three chiefs of staff of the Army held a meeting at 11 AM this morning and formally decided to recommend General Sugiyama Gen, the Inspector General of Military Education, as the first candidate for Minister of the Army. General Sugiyama's original position will be temporarily filled by Lieutenant General Nakamura Kotaro, the chief of staff of the Inspectorate General of Military Education, or Lieutenant General Hata Shunroku, the commander of the Taiwan Army, may be transferred to become the Inspector General of Military Education.

### Britain and France Borrow 40 Million Pounds

Agreement Signed

[Paris] Several large British banks, led by Rothschild Brothers Bank and Morgan Grenfell & Co., have lent a huge sum of 40 million pounds to French railway companies. The loan agreement was signed tonight, with a term of ten months and an interest rate of 3.5%. The entire amount has been allocated by British banks, and the bonds will be kept and not circulated on the market. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

[London] After the French loan agreement was concluded in Paris tonight, financial circles here expressed satisfaction, believing that although the French Treasury is temporarily experiencing financial difficulties due to the sluggish tax revenue, the current loan has been established, so its financial resources can be activated, pending the recovery of tax revenue in the coming months. In addition, the financial cooperation between Britain and France can also be clearly demonstrated by the establishment of this loan, and the speculators' attempts to break the front created by the tripartite monetary agreement between Britain, France, and the United States are ultimately futile. Financial circles are also optimistic about the French currency situation. At this time, the spot exchange rate of the franc against the pound has risen from 105.15 francs to 105.14 francs, and the futures rate has risen from 108.15 francs to 107.77 francs. It is generally believed that the establishment of the French loan from Britain and the increase in the discount rate of the Bank of France are the reasons for the appreciation of the franc. In addition, the market prices of various French government bonds on the stock exchange have also risen. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

### France and Germany Begin Preliminary Trade Agreement Negotiations

[Berlin] The representative of the French Ministry of Commerce, Alphand, arrived here today to conduct preliminary negotiations on the German-French trade agreement. Financial issues will be discussed first. When Germany and France settle accounts, Germany still owes France about 1,100,000,000 francs. The French government is very interested in concluding a tourist transport agreement so that 60,000 Germans, each carrying an average of 5,000 francs in checks, can go to Paris to visit the World Expo in May. However, Germany currently needs all foreign exchange to purchase food and raw materials, so the French government's wishes are difficult to realize. It is generally believed here that France will send another representative to Berlin in February to actively conduct negotiations. (KMT dispatch on the 29th)

### Germany and Spanish Rebels Will Discuss Commerce

Formal Trade Agreement Postponed

Salamanca According to news from Yun Tong, the German government and the Spanish Nationalist government will send economic experts to begin discussions in the near future to adjust commercial relations. It is said that a clearing agreement will be concluded first. The current trade agreement between Germany and Spain was signed by the Madrid government, and Germany no longer recognizes that government, so these negotiations should be interpreted from a legal point of view. It is said that the purpose of these negotiations is to clarify the situation, and whether the timing of the signing of a formal trade agreement is ripe depends on the results of these negotiations.

### Shandong Match Factories Oppose Expanded United Association

Factory Representatives Petition in Jinan for Days, Issue Declaration Exposing Truth of Dispute

Jinan Dispatch: Match factories in this province have long opposed the monopolistic control of the National Match Production and Sales United Association. Recently, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry jointly decided to order factories to join the association by a deadline, or else their registration would be revoked and licenses would be suspended. This has further placed the factories in dire straits. Shandong has the most match factories in the country, so the stakes are highest there. Eighteen match factories, including those in Qingdao and Jinan like Luxi, have jointly petitioned their local governments to uphold the Ministry's decision to change the resolution. In Jinan, representatives such as Li Jianzhai and Yu Jiesan have been visiting Governor Han Fuqu of the Provincial Government and Director Zhang Honglie of the Construction Department for days. In addition to submitting documents, they have verbally presented evidence of the United Association's control and subservience to foreign interests, such as Article 37 of the association's charter: "The association's working capital is set at 5 million national currency, to be paid by members in proportion to their production within the time limit set by the association." This 5 million working capital should be borne by more than 70 factories. Furthermore, it is estimated that the factories have about 1,000 machines, which means each machine would have to bear 5,000 yuan, and if they don't pay, they will be forced to withdraw. Not many match factories have large capital; often, they have eight machines but only 20,000 yuan in capital. If they have to pay the capital, they would still have to owe 20,000 yuan. Now, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry have ordered them to join the association by February 1st, or else their registration will be revoked and their licenses will be suspended. Joining the United Association is death for the factories, and not joining is also death. Furthermore, the United Association restricts the production of Chinese merchants. For example, the 18 factories currently have 150 machines and produce 300 large boxes (40 yuan per box). According to the restriction, they can only produce a little more than 100 boxes. How can they survive? At the same time, the agreement stipulates that Japanese merchants are allowed to increase production by 110,740 large boxes per month. Of the six Japanese factories, three have already closed down, leaving only three. If Japanese merchants are allowed to increase production by this amount, not only will the three closed factories be revived, but several more will be allowed to be established. What is this if not subservience to foreign interests? Currently, all 18 factories are in Shandong, directly and indirectly employing tens of thousands of people. If this method is followed, the 18 factories will have to close down entirely. The factories are not to be pitied, but the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of people is a major problem. The provincial government and the Qingdao municipal government both recognize that this problem is very serious and have decided to work together to find a solution. Director Zhang Honglie of the Construction Department has telegraphed Liu Hongsheng, the person in charge of the United Association, asking him to come to Jinan or Qingdao to hold a meeting with the match factories to discuss a solution. However, as of the 28th, Liu had not replied. It is said that if Liu holds a meeting in Qingdao, Zhang Honglie will go to Qingdao to participate in the meeting. If Liu holds a meeting in Jinan, Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie will come to Jinan to participate.

Attached is the declaration issued by the factories on the truth of this dispute: "Reluctant to be slaughtered and striving for survival is the motivation for the establishment of the joint office of our 18 factories, and it is also the goal of our 18 factories' joint office in its unremitting struggle with the National Match Production and Sales United Association. However, after years of struggle, limited by manpower, financial resources, and various other factors, it has not been resolved. The association has engaged in malicious propaganda to deceive people, fearing that people from all walks of life will not understand the truth or suspect that the opposition to the United Association is for private gain. Therefore, we sincerely present the inside story of the United Association's organization and the attitude and struggle of our 18 factories to the people of society, asking for sympathy and assistance, and appealing to the government, hoping to obtain a fair and appropriate solution so that national industry will not be prematurely cut short by accidental destruction. In March of last year, the All-China Match Industry Federation convened the second temporary representative meeting. The notice did not mention the establishment of a United Association. Many manufacturers from afar thought it was a normal routine meeting and entrusted representatives from other factories to attend. On the 18th of the same month, the United Association's plan, charter, and the planned directors, supervisors, general managers, and deputy managers of the branch offices were suddenly proposed at the meeting. It was also publicly announced that they had been submitted to the ministries for record, and that the Chinese and Japanese sides had agreed that no changes could be made. The merchants and most members believed that the United Association was a free association among the industry, which has a skin-to-skin relationship with each factory. However, they were not informed of anything beforehand. After reading the charter and agreement, they found that many of them violated the law and ceded rights. Therefore, with the qualifications of the industry, they put forward opinions, first asking the Qingdao branch to take responsibility, and then sending representatives to Shanghai to request the head office to amend them. After running around and negotiating, they were not understood by the association. In the end, they had to expose the inside story, state the reasons in detail, and appeal to the ministries and provincial and municipal governments for amendments. The association did not reflect on itself, but presented a vague report to the government, destroying the head office in a few days, hoping to seize the position, overturning the United Association immediately, and using various slanders to counter them to facilitate private gain, causing the United Association's business to fall into a stalemate. Until January 9th of this year, we received a letter from the head office of the United Association, stating that the representative of the Ministry of Finance had telegraphed, stating that on November 16th and 17th of the 25th year, the Ministry convened the Ministry of Industry to send personnel to a meeting at the Tax Affairs Department, and notified the responsible personnel of the association to attend and explain. After the two ministries held a meeting, it was decided that all Chinese match factories must join the United Association before January 20th of this year. If they have not joined the association by February 1st, the Ministry of Industry will revoke their registration, and the Ministry of Finance will stop selling flower stamps and issuing licenses, and will not give any further grace period. The telegram ordered the association to forward it to our 18 factories for compliance. This is the inside story of the organization of the United Association and the story of the struggles of our 18 factories. Please recognize the society, don't be obscured by the smoke screen of the United Association. The inside story of the association is as described above. Now, let's analyze the contents of its charter and agreement. Let's not talk about other things, let's just take the most obvious drawbacks. For example, Article 37 states that the association's working capital is set at 5 million national currency, to be paid by members in proportion to their production within the time limit set by the association. Article 45 states that in the event of losses, they will still be borne by the members and deducted from the goods payment that should be received by the members. In addition, the association's annual expenses are more than 1 million, and the start-up costs are not small, all of which are borne and supplied by the members. It is a huge amount to pay, and there is unlimited liability for the shares. What guarantee is there? What is it for? Isn't it deliberately making it difficult for small factories to force them to close down? Another example is Article 34, which states that the voting rights of the members' meeting are calculated according to the production ratio. Article 33 states that if the resolution of the members' meeting is still inconsistent with the position of the board of directors of the head office after applying for reconsideration, the board of directors of the head office will resolve it in consultation with the China Match Industry Federation. Article 15 states that members, except for self-dissolution or loss of manufacturing rights, may not request to withdraw from the association for any reason. Once they join the association, they are sentenced to death. There is no room for expressing opinions, and there is no possibility of withdrawing. As for the formulation of the production ratio and calculation method in Articles 3 and 10•11, and the conditions of agreement with the Japanese side, it is even more heartbreaking that foreign factories are given special preferential treatment, while Chinese factories are arbitrarily discounted and exploited. Furthermore, the directors and supervisors of the association are all designated by private individuals, and there are no alternate directors and supervisors. It is unnecessary to argue that its organization is illegal. As for its managers and important staff, they are all monopolized by private individuals. If they go their own way like this, who will be responsible if there is any corruption? This is why the merchants have never dared to agree. In short, the reason why the 18 merchants and factories have carefully considered and dare not join the United Association is that the motivation is entirely caused by the collusion of a few powerful manufacturers with foreigners to destroy the industry and create a monopoly policy, and small factories have no possibility of survival. However, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry only convened the responsible personnel of the United Association to attend and explain at the meeting in November last year, and did not notify our manufacturers to express their opinions. Of course, only one side of the story was presented. It is no wonder that the association was able to present a vague report with exaggerated words and malicious speculation. Judging from the circumstances, how can the so-called correction and rectification of the two ministries be said to be fair? The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry did not deeply investigate the real cause of this dispute and the motivation of the merchants and factories to refuse to join, and forcibly ordered them to join the United Association by February 1st, and threatened to revoke their registration and stop selling flower stamps and issuing licenses if they exceeded the deadline. It does not seem to be the ultimate intention of loving the manufacturers and treating them equally. We hereby declare that if the charter and agreement of the association can be legally corrected, the merchants and factories will get what they want and will naturally comply and join. Otherwise, their blood money is at stake, and the business is at stake. Rather than being forced to join and be slaughtered by others and cut off their own livelihood, it is better to make a final sacrifice and still have honor. At this time when the match industry is in unprecedented crisis, it is not enough to encourage it to survive. It is impossible to bear the association's request. If you do not investigate clearly and handle it according to the agreed method without any falsehood, the merchants and factories have limited financial resources and weak strength. They can only wait for the government's decision. We dare to ask the wise government authorities to correct it quickly and obtain a reasonable solution as soon as possible. The merchants uphold justice, shout loudly, and have no hesitation at the critical moment of life and death. It can be said that the reluctance of our people to be slaughtered and strive for survival is a problem for our merchants, and it can also be said to be a problem for the national industry. The merchants dare to say that justice is in the hearts of the people, and right and wrong will not be erased after all. The people of society and the public opinion circles of the people's mouthpiece will definitely give the merchants sympathy and assistance. This is just a declaration." (28th)

### Rice Prices in Guangdong Province Continue to Rise

The reason is that domestic rice cannot be continuously supplied, and foreign rice is expensive and cannot be transported to Guangdong

Guangzhou Dispatch: In recent days, although more than 3,000 bags of rice from Anhui have been transported to Guangdong, and the Civil Food Regulation Association has sold them to rice shops at fair prices to carry out price stabilization, each yuan can buy more than eight catties. However, the mere 3,000 bags have been sold out in less than three days. The price of rice has risen slightly and then increased. On the 28th, the price of ordinary white rice increased by several cents per yuan. According to general observations, the reason for the rice price increase is purely due to the shortage of rice sources. Rice from Anhui and Hunan cannot be continuously supplied. Although the tax on foreign rice has been reduced by half, merchants have not dared to purchase it. Because the rice in Vietnam and Siam is scarce due to crop failures in the producing areas and is sold to Europe in large quantities. After foreign rice arrives in Hong Kong, the price is not cheap. The price of high-quality foreign rice is about 11 yuan per picul, the price of medium-quality rice is about 10 yuan per picul, and the price of low-quality coarse rice is also about 9 yuan per picul. If it is transported from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, a customs duty of 3.8 yuan per picul is required (half price is 1.9 yuan). Even if medium-quality foreign rice is used as an example, the cost of transporting it to Guangdong, including customs duties and transportation costs, reaches more than 12 yuan per picul. Compared with the 12 yuan per picul for transporting Anhui rice to Guangdong, foreign rice is more expensive than Anhui rice. Therefore, although the government has reduced the tax on foreign rice by half, foreign rice still cannot be transported to Guangdong. Therefore, the rice shortage in Guangdong Province is becoming increasingly serious. The Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, seeing this, has once again telegraphed the central authorities, requesting that foreign rice be exempted from tax for six months. The reason is that from a practical point of view, purchasing foreign rice and allowing customs duties to be recorded at half price, limited to 300,000 metric tons, will still have little effect in relieving the current rice shortage in Guangdong Province. The way to cure the problem is to exempt foreign rice from tax for six months, so that universal relief can be provided and panic will not occur during the period of food scarcity. Although the central government will temporarily reduce tax revenue, it is enough to save the 30 million people of Guangdong Province from this disaster. The party and government also feel concerned about the food situation in Guangdong Province. The People's Food Relief Association, initiated and organized by the Provincial Party Department, was established on the 27th. It is divided into four groups: General Affairs, Investigation, Publicity, and Design. The tasks of each group are assigned to various organizations. As for the Civil Food Regulation Association, initiated and organized by the Department of Finance, has signed a contract with a banking group, and the banking group will release 4 million yuan in food mortgages, which are guaranteed by the Department of Finance, with weekly interest of six percent. The Civil Food Regulation Association is responsible for the profits and losses of rice procurement. After obtaining this loan, the Food Association has telegraphed Anhui Province to purchase a second batch of 40,000 bags of rice from Anhui, which will be transported to Guangdong by waterway for distribution to rice shops for price stabilization.

### Songjiang Command Executes Traitors

The Baoshan County Public Security Bureau arrested two suspects, Wang Si and Seng Chenghe, on August 4th of last year, and transferred them to the Third District Security Command for detailed interrogation. They confessed to being instructed by a certain party to probe military intelligence and highways and bridges, etc. Many evidences were found at Chenghe’s side. After admitting the accusations, the bureau proposed to sentence Wang Si to death for endangering the Republic of China, and Chenghe to 13 years in prison. The files were submitted to the superior authorities for approval. As a result, Wang Si was sent to Songjiang this morning by troops, and the death penalty was announced in the regular court. After tying up the criminal, he was paraded through the streets for a week, and then executed by firing squad at the Xiaojiao Field.

### Chongming Inspector Zhang Accused of Smoking Opium

Zhang Jianbai, an inspector at the Third Precinct of the Fort Town Public Security Bureau in this county, was secretly reported to the provincial government and special commissioner's office for smoking opium and raping female workers in a cotton mill. The provincial government ordered the county government to send him to a drug rehabilitation hospital for examination regarding the smoking opium charge, and to send personnel to investigate the rape of women. After receiving the order, the county government ordered Inspector Zhang to go to the county and send him to the county hospital for examination.

### Robbery and Injury in Jiading's Yandunxia

### Favorable Small Victory for the Ideal Team in the Second Inter-Port Trial Match

The Ideal Team's Momentum Was Strong in the First Half, Scoring Four to One; The Chinese Team Recovered Two Goals, Resulting in Four to Three

Yesterday, the Chinese football team played the second inter-port trial match against the inter-port Ideal Team of Westerners. In the first half, Berlin Guy scored four goals alone, leading the Ideal Team with a score of four to one, and their momentum was very strong. In the second half, the Chinese team changed its lineup and recovered one goal, but was defeated with a score of four to three. In yesterday's game, both sides focused on individual skills, and the outcome was not considered important. The Chinese team was also selecting representatives to go to Hong Kong, so selection committees from both sides came to the venue to observe. At the start, the lineups of both sides were as follows:

Ideal Team Scored Four Consecutive Goals. The Ideal Team appeared with the most standard formation. The Chinese team responded with a pure, all-Tung Wah team. After the coin toss, the Chinese team attacked first, with Tuile advancing, but the shot hit the post. Sun Jinshun crossed, but Dai Linjing lost his footing. After a stalemate of nine minutes, the Ideal Team launched another attack. Li Ning made an accidental mistake, and Berlin Guy took the opportunity to break through, shooting from the penalty spot and scoring 1-0. The Ideal Team's offense was very strong, circling in Chinese territory for a long time. The Chinese team also had many good opportunities, but Wang Kehou made mistake after mistake, and Jia Youliang was repeatedly offside, missing opportunities. Zhang Rongcai performed best, saving dangerous shots many times, especially after colliding with Berlin Guy and falling to the ground, he immediately jumped up and kicked the ball out. The spinning ball went backwards, but fortunately Zhang's eyes were quick, and he turned around and caught it, which was greatly praised. The stalemate lasted until the 32nd minute, when Jim Watt passed the ball in, and Berlin Guy headed it in. Zhang Yue failed to catch it, and another goal was lost, making it 2-0. Minutes later, Jim Watt dribbled the ball and shot again. Zhang blocked it with both hands, and the ball bounced off the crossbar, but unexpectedly Berlin Guy took the opportunity to head it in, entering from Zhang's right side, losing three cities in a row. One minute later, Tuile sent the ball in from the baseline, with an excellent angle. Berlin Guy waited for the right moment, lowered his head and touched it, and it flew like an arrow, again brushing past Zhang's right side and entering the net, making it 4-0. After the center line kickoff, the Chinese team launched a major counterattack. Three minutes later, Feng Yunyou sent the ball forward from afar, Sun Jinshun passed it to the front of the goal, and Dai Linjing and Wang Kehou rushed up together and touched it, scoring one goal and bringing the score to 4-1. After that, Ma Shaner rushed to the front line to help the attack, and the Chinese team encountered dangerous situations again, but fortunately did not lose any more goals. The first half ended with a score of 4-1.

The Chinese Team Grabbed Back Two Goals. The Ideal Team only replaced Peir with Pan Jinsheng, and the rest remained unchanged. The Chinese team made many more changes. After the exchange of fire, the Ideal Team's two attacks failed. The Chinese team gradually became more active. Luo Douwen was slow to move forward, resulting in another missed opportunity. Sun Jinshun, Xu Buyun, and Dai Linjing also missed many shots. Then the Chinese team was again in a dangerous situation several times, but Zhang saved them one by one, especially catching Berlin Guy's fierce shot, which was his greatest contribution. The stalemate lasted for about half an hour, with no records and extremely boring. Thirty-one minutes into the poem, Jia dribbled the ball forward and sent it in. Dai Linjing blocked Ma Shaner, and Luo Douwen shot with his right foot, hitting the right corner of the net, bringing the score to 4-2. Three minutes later, Ma Shaner committed a handball in the penalty area. Sun Jinshun executed the penalty kick, bringing the score to 4-3. At this point, the numbers became closer, and the situation became more tense. The Chinese team's offense was still very close, but they missed the opportunity. In the last few minutes, the Ideal Team's offense became even fiercer. Jim shot from afar, and it was extremely sharp. Zhang again caught it high with both hands, which was really not easy. Unexpectedly, Ma committed another handball, but fortunately it was outside the penalty area. Liu Shizan took the free kick, but it was caught by Bao Saizhong. Finally, Xu Jingcheng shot fiercely, over the crossbar. When the whistle blew, the Chinese team lost badly with a score of 4-3 due to too many losses in the first half.

### Zhejiang Library's Fifth Anniversary of Reorganization

Adding 100,000 Volumes in Five Years; Over 800,000 Readers and Borrowers

The Zhejiang Provincial Library has been established for 34 years and has a collection of over 300,000 volumes, making it a major provincial library in the country. Since it was ordered to reorganize in January 21, and Chen Xunzi took over as the current director, it has been five years, and he has worked hard on library affairs, and the promotion of all aspects has been quite effective. It is learned that the library held a commemorative meeting on the 25th, and a get-together was held in the evening. Chen gave a detailed report on the library's progress in the past five years. Because the library's career is closely related to the progress of academic education in Zhejiang Province, the reporter specially learned the following statistics on the library's collection and reading in the past five years: In the past five years, the Zhejiang Library has added a total of 67,919 books, including 43,820 purchased volumes and 24,099 donated volumes. In addition, there are 44,000 volumes of Wang's books that were previously collected and newly registered, totaling 110,000 volumes, an average annual increase of 12,000 volumes. To date, the Zhejiang Library has about 60,000 volumes of Siku Quanshu and rare books, about 10,000 volumes of foreign language documents, about 280,000 volumes of Chinese books, and 8,000 bound volumes of magazines and newspapers, making it the library with the most books among the provincial libraries in the country. As for reading and borrowing books, the library added new characters in the autumn of the 21st year, and the original two library sites were used as branch libraries. After September of the 23rd year, a daily opening method was implemented, that is, the weekly holiday on Monday was cancelled, and it was open for borrowing and reading every day of the year from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, which was convenient for readers. The borrowing of books used credit guarantee procedures, which was extremely convenient. In the last year, methods such as delivering borrowed books to the city and communicating with the province were implemented, which further promoted it. As a result, the number of people has increased year by year. It is estimated that in about five years from February of the 21st year to the end of December of last year, a total of 802,087 people read and borrowed books (excluding daily newspapers), including 240,000 people in the 24th year, which is four times the 60,000 people in the 21st year. The number of books read and borrowed reached 2,093,198 volumes, with an average of 649 volumes read by readers per day in five years, which shows the popularity of reading and borrowing. As for the compilation of catalogs, the "Wenlan Journal" quarterly and the Library Outlook monthly were compiled and published. The organization and storage of increased copies of plates, the holding of exhibitions and academic lectures, the guidance of the province's library undertakings, and the improvement of the printing work have had many auxiliary effects on education and academics. The Zhejiang Literature Exhibition, which was organized by the hall in November of last year, was a major cultural and educational event, and many places followed suit. It is said that the library feels that the book storage and reading room are insufficient due to the increase in books and reading, and is planning to increase the construction of the library. The Zhejiang Provincial Government and the educational administrative authorities, in view of the fact that there is only one provincial library in the province (Jiangsu has three), also intend to help the library develop for the purpose of promoting the province's academic culture.

### Zhoushan Middle School

Students Seek Members

Zhoushan Middle School in Dinghai, Zhejiang Province, was founded with funds from Liu Hongsheng and others.

Therefore, the association decided at a meeting held at the Dinghai Fellow Association on January 19 to expand its recruitment from February 1, and elected Yuan Yang'an, Qiu Guozhen, Fan Caicong, Zhou Shuwu, Dong Hongjun, Liang Fengxiang, Hu Shigui and other seven people as directors.

### Several Issues Concerning English Teaching in Secondary Education (4)

— Wang Shijie

To make teaching practical, to passively reduce employment difficulties, and to actively increase employment opportunities, based on the current situation, only those who cannot advance to higher education should enter society and start working. Before graduation, neither the students themselves nor their parents often give sufficient consideration to what kind of work they should do. Furthermore, those running schools often do not pay sufficient attention to providing them with guidance. Whether to pursue further education or to enter the workforce is left to chance. This represents an enormous and obvious loss to the nation, society, families, and individuals. After graduating from secondary school, some students should go on to higher education, while others should enter the workforce. Which types of students should pursue higher education, and which should enter the workforce? This is an important issue concerning national policy, social needs, and the personal futures of students. While it is practically impossible for a nation to provide higher education opportunities for everyone, it is also questionable in terms of students' innate talents, academic abilities, and personalities. Students' innate talents, academic abilities, and personalities are factual issues and should be considered as prerequisites for either pursuing further education or entering the workforce. Many students may not possess the innate talents and academic abilities to enter university, but that does not mean they cannot do beneficial work, or even do better than students who have attended university. Those running educational institutions and responsible for guiding students should understand each student's innate talents, academic abilities, and personality. Only those suitable for higher education should be encouraged to pursue it. Those who are not suitable for higher education should be informed of this fact early on and advised to prepare for employment after graduation. We should never assume that everyone should or can pursue higher education. Such an assumption is unfounded and dangerous. Furthermore, we should clearly inform those unsuitable for higher education, before they graduate or choose a school, about the appropriate schools they should attend. We should also provide them with a planned, step-by-step, and practical preparation for employment, tailored to their individual innate talents, academic abilities, and personalities. Currently, the government is making great efforts to reduce the number of general secondary schools and increase the number of vocational and normal schools. This is just one remedial measure. A fundamental reform requires every secondary school to pay close attention to this issue. This is essential in vocational schools and should also receive considerable attention in general secondary schools. Some young people tend to aim too high when choosing a career, and this should be avoided. Only by choosing a career that suits one's own innate talents, academic abilities, and personality, and that meets the needs of the nation and society, can both the individual and the nation benefit. China is currently in an extraordinary situation. In all fields, such as military affairs, politics, finance, construction, domestic and foreign affairs, education, industry, medicine, and public health, there is an urgent need for leaders and talent. However, we must not forget that in all these fields, we also need middle and lower-level cadres and talent. Currently, in all industries, not only is there a lack of high-level command personnel, but there is also a felt void in middle and lower-level cadres and talent. This is a very noteworthy matter. Without a sufficient number and quality of middle and lower-level cadres and talent, these undertakings cannot be done well. The importance of this aspect is perhaps overlooked by many. These middle and lower-level cadres and talent are an important foundation for supporting all industries. They also require considerable talent and training. Some of them come from universities and specialized schools, while others come from secondary schools. Many of them are specialized and technical personnel, and the rest must bear varying degrees of responsibility for the matters under their jurisdiction. Their ability to work largely depends on the technical and moral training they receive in school. China's secondary education should truly pay attention to adapting to this urgent need of the nation and provide a sufficient number of qualified personnel for various industries' middle and lower-level cadres.

### Yarn and Cotton

February Yarn Unusually High

Indian Merchants Continue to Buy and Hold / Market Speculators Scramble to Cover Positions / Gap Between Near and Far Contracts Widens

The yarn market continues to be firm, with the February contract particularly strong. Indian merchants are buying up large quantities and refusing to release them, leading to market rumors of a possible squeeze. Speculators, wary of the unfavorable environment, are rushing to cover their positions, driving prices higher. Only a few are scouring for spot yarn to deliver. No major fluctuations are expected during this settlement period, but future changes are difficult to predict.

Deferred Yarn Seeing Sell-offs / The opening price of the spot yarn market jumped two yuan for February delivery. Due to aggressive buying by Indian merchants, large quantities were absorbed, drying up the market. However, deferred contracts saw some sell-offs, widening the gap between near and far contracts.

Recent Trading in American Cotton More Active

Yesterday, the opening of American cotton showed a sluggish and dull market. Prices fell by 5 to 8 points across various months due to poor Liverpool telegraph, easing of flood conditions, and profit-taking by domestic and international longs.

The soft, sharp, and shady rice of Du Yang settled by yuan.

(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the source of the river roads was thirty-one two numbers, and the various sales roads in the city were still light. The price of white rice in the city was also slightly reduced to 0.1 yuan. The price of the yangdu bujian xian rice was soft, and the price of white yuan was tired. The appetite for early thin rice was quite active, and the price was tight. The price of other goods did not rise or fall.

The Freight Owners All Wish to Sell Spot Goods

Yesterday, although the Ke Xian market saw a slight decrease in the arrival of goods, the floating inventory in the city was very abundant. A part of the pedestrian guests still mainly settled early, and the river rice cut back, and the heart was quite soft. Therefore, although there was activity from the North and South gangs, the market was still flat. Guangdong's appetite was still good all day, but this year's ship position was insufficient, only 45,000 bags of machine brown rice were handled. It is said that there are still 34 ships to be installed this year, and although the installation of goods seems to be more, Shantou Xiamen is slightly embellished, but the North Ocean gang has not been smoothly handled for a long time, and 34,000 machine red rice and so on were handled yesterday. Therefore, there is still a part of the people in the city hoping for good. All day, 5,120 bags of Jiangxi rice were opened, 450 bags of Shashi Hunan machine red rice, and 1,000 bags of Jiaxing crude silver tip.

The Spot Powder Delivery Only Has Jing Tong Goods Coming

Yesterday was the delivery of a day's worth of flour, and the quantity was not smooth, because the goods from each factory in this port were drawn and loaded by the customer gangs one after another beforehand, so there was no delivery, only Nanjing Dafactory delivered 7,000 bags of green rabbits. Nantong Fuxin Factory handed over Xu Danwanbao's most important system of temporary purchase and hired workers to turn around in Longhai Road, in order to make the market cheap and easy to promote.

Half of the Spot Wheat Delivered Is Loaded to Tianjin

The delivery of wheat has been soothed and neat, and the total number is one hundred and nineteen cars. Half of them have been transferred to Tianjin, and the rest are still sold to Shen Factory. As for the current wheat market, the factory stomach is slightly better, and the prices of each file are slightly better by a few points. Jiangbei wheat opened 6 yuan and 1 and a half jiao, and the wheat along the Jinpu Road opened 6 yuan 2 and 7 jiao, seeing a delivery of more than 3,000 bags.

Also, the Cereals Exchange issued a notice that "The date of this year's Spring Festival holiday, photographed until February 5, the market will be closed from the 6th to the 14th, and the normal hearing and photographing will be held on the morning of Monday the 15th."

### Silk and Tea

The Price Difference between Domestic and Foreign White Factories Is Still Far Away

Yesterday, overseas silk markets in Japan and the United States saw slight gains. Yokohama spot goods re-emerged at 900 yuan, closing at 903 yuan, up 10 yuan from the previous day. Futures were up 4 yuan and remained stable. New York spot was up 1 cent, and futures were up 1 and a half cents. Other Japanese silk and Shanghai silk each rose 2 cents, Guangdong silk rose 3 cents, and the Lyon silk market was stable and did not change much. Yesterday, the Shanghai silk market saw a slight sale from foreign firms. B-grade was priced at 775 yuan for 78 points, down 5 yuan from the previous day. Gray silk sign grade was priced at 410 yuan, up 15 yuan from the previous day. The price held by the local manufacturers was B font 13.15 which was 830 yuan, 20.22 which was 770 yuan, the former price that Western merchants eat was 800 yuan, and the latter price was only 740 yuan, the distance was still about 30 yuan. So there were only a small number of transactions, totaling 121 bales.

Japanese Tea Exports to the Soviet Union Increase Sharply

The Soviet Union has always been a large consumer of tea. In previous years, Chinese tea was sold to Russia, averaging around 300,000 boxes each year. Recently, there has been a sharp decline, falling to 130,000 boxes. The sales of Chinese tea have been severely hit. Although Russia has promoted tea production, the large-scale competition from Japanese tea is also a major cause of the injury. According to general informed sources, since the transfer of the China Eastern Railway, Japanese green tea has been sold to Russia every year, with more than 200,000 boxes, most of which have been compensated by road credits. From the current situation, if Chinese people do not seek to improve and strive to expand Sino-Russian trade, but continue to let nature take its course, it will be difficult to restore the sales of Chinese tea in Russia.

### Metals

Large Tinplate Prices Increase More Than Ten Yuan

Since yarn factories, toy factories, military factories, and others purchased, the standard in the market has been exhausted and the standard has risen sharply due to lack of goods, such as the twenty-fourth number is estimated at one hundred yuan per box, and the twenty-sixth number is estimated at one hundred and thirty yuan, which are all better than the previous ten yuan. It is found that as many as four or fifty boxes were opened yesterday, but overseas prices have soared, so the market in this port may be difficult to return to loose.

Hard Lead Wire Stock is Exhausted

Due to the fact that hard lead wire has not arrived from overseas for a long time, the flow of goods in this port is also exhausted, and the market has risen as a result. The coarse color is estimated at sixteen or seventeen yuan, and the fine color is estimated at fourteen or five yuan. I heard that spring factories and Ningbo gangs need to be used, and there is no general purchase.

### North and South Goods

Almonds: Tianjin Inventory Scarce

According to Tianjin sources, almond inventory is very low, especially high-quality goods, with only over a hundred packages in total. The highest-quality North Mountain almonds are priced at one hundred yuan, the next at ninety-one yuan, Central Village at sixty-seven yuan and fifty cents, bitter almonds at twelve yuan and eight cents, and the next at twenty-one yuan and three cents.

### Miscellaneous News

Endless Stream of Japanese Goods

Chinese People Love to Eat Japanese Sugar

Imports of Japanese goods are exceptionally brisk, with sugar being the most prominent. Last week, the Jia Yi Liu (甲二六) Maru and Mikasa Maru (三笠丸) ships transported over ten thousand eight hundred packages, as reported previously. Today, the Aso (阿蘇) and Ikoma (生駒) ships arrived, loaded with large quantities of Japanese goods, totaling over six thousand seven hundred tons. Among them are seventeen thousand one hundred twenty packages of sugar, over two thousand seven hundred pieces of copper wire, over eight thousand six hundred pieces of iron sheet, three thousand one hundred cans of petroleum, four hundred forty boxes of sulfur, one thousand boxes of hydrochloric acid, and a large quantity of bleaching powder, alcohol, and other goods.

Shen Bao Children's Supplement

### Forge Iron-Like Physique to Avenge Our Humiliation!

— Yan Maode

Children, health is the fountain of life. Locke once said: "A great undertaking resides in a healthy physique." This shows the importance of health. With a healthy physique, we can have an indomitable spirit. With an indomitable spirit, we can shoulder significant responsibilities.

In Hamburg, Germany, every time it snows in winter, a group of children, wearing only single layers of clothing and bare arms, exercise their bodies in the freezing snow. Someone asked them why they weren't afraid of the cold. They said, "We want to forge iron-like bodies so we can avenge France!" Children, they are preparing like this from a young age. Their national patriotic spirit is truly something we admire and are ashamed of.

Children! You must know that modern warfare is a bitter and difficult national war. Everything relies on a strong body, able to endure arduous struggles, before one can go to battle. However, our old and large China, despite having thousands of years of culture, has a national physique weakened to the extreme. That is why Westerners call us the "Sick Man of East Asia."

Children! You are all the masters of the future, bearing great responsibilities. To avenge the nation's humiliation and build a new China, a strong physique is essential. Strengthening the nation requires strengthening the race, and strengthening the race must start from childhood. From now on, forge an iron-like physique to avenge our humiliation! Children! Remember these words.

### The Four Martyrs

— Jun Peng

Children! Who are the Four Martyrs? They are four brave warriors from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps: Luo Yunxiang, Mao Zhengxiang, Bao Zhengwu, and Ying Wenda. On the eve of the "January 28th" War, their most important rescue work was immediately established, and each of them swore an oath: "To be loyal to the country, rescue those in distress, and disregard all sacrifices." Under the command of the团长 (regiment leader, this might be a mistranslation, but I don't know if that is the case) they all set off, team after team, holding high the flags of the Red Cross, to carry out rescue work in the Zhabei war zone. On the morning of the 31st, these four brave warriors were, of course, sent out to work, but they did not return until evening. They were killed inexplicably! And their remains are still unknown. Later, in order to commemorate these four boy scouts, we had to create a cenotaph for the Four Martyrs.

What day is today? It is the day that Luo Yunxiang, Mao Zhengxiang, Bao Zhengwu, and Ying Wenda, four loyal and brave Chinese boy scouts, sacrificed their lives for the sake of their country! Children, aren't we all boy scouts? So, after seeing the Four Martyrs, what do you express? What are your feelings? Do you have the courage of the Four Martyrs? In times of extreme crisis, would you be willing to sacrifice everything and do rescue work on the battlefield? Children! We should know that we are not afraid of death(?). As long as it is for the nation to fight for survival and for the country to seek independence, we are willing to sacrifice everything. At the same time, the death of the Four Martyrs is very glorious, because they died for the sake of their country! Therefore, their heroic deeds can shake the entire China, the entire world, especially our boy scouts. Their heroic names will be immortal. But the Four Martyrs are dead. How will we comfort them in the afterlife?

### Animals' Protection Against Cold

— Cao Yixuan

When the weather turns cold, everyone prepares clothes to protect against the cold. However, animals have already naturally prepared for this early on. For example, animal fur falls out when spring warms up, and sparse summer fur grows instead. When the cold wind chills to the bone at the turn of autumn and winter, they grow a new layer of soft, dense winter fur, and the color of the fur is different in winter and summer. This serves to protect against the cold and against external harm. Some animals also store more fat in their bodies in winter to nourish themselves when food is scarce, or they store fat under their skin to prevent heat from dissipating. For example: ㊀ Deer spots disappear in winter. In the summer, they have beautiful spots all over their bodies. As autumn cools down in September, they gradually change. By mid-October, they completely change to winter fur, and all the white spots disappear, turning into a mixed brown color. The female deer also grow hair around their heads, and their soft antlers also become hard antlers. So when there are spots, the antlers are soft, and when the spots disappear, the antlers become hard. ㊁ Wild boars turn gray in August and gradually grow winter fur, turning brown. At the same time, they grow long hair from their heads to their backs. ㊂ When giraffes grow summer fur, they regrow a layer of winter fur in winter. Although the fur color does not change, the summer fur becomes thicker and denser. ㊃ Wild rabbits have yellow and black mottled fur in the summer, but in autumn and winter, the fur on their waist and abdomen turns white, gradually changing to the tips of their ears, and the rest of their body is white. ㊄ Arctic foxes are yellowish-brown in the summer and pure white in the winter. Because the weather in the Arctic is cold and the ground is covered in ice and snow, they turn white for protection. ㊅ When it gets cold in the Arctic, bears grow long hair around their necks, encircling their necks. ㊅ Since the beginning of winter, the fur of camels gradually lengthens, and by the time spring warms up, the fur gradually falls off, looking like they are naked. The above is the natural physiological state of mammals' protection against cold. The same is true for birds. For example, male mandarin ducks grow full feathers on their backs, and these feathers fall off in the summer. Females are the same, but the color of the bill is yellow for females and red for males. This is the difference between males and females. Next are ptarmigans. These birds live in high mountains and are yellow in the summer and pure white with thick feathers in the winter. However, male birds have red feathers above their eyes that are the same as their summer fur, and the outside of their tails is black. There is also a kind of plover whose black-brown spots on their heads turn completely white in winter. So if we don't understand the reason for the change in birds' feathers, we will be suspicious. In fact, the change in the feathers of any bird or animal depends on the cold and heat. It's like we wear silk shirts in the summer, which is one way of dressing, and in the winter, we change to fur coats and woolen robes and coats. That's another way of dressing.

### Cuttlefish

— Zhong Mei

Xiao Min's mother bought a few cuttlefish from the market, and she prepared to make a delicious dish for Xiao Min. During lunch, Xiao Min ate the cuttlefish, but he didn't know what he was eating because it was the first time he had tasted this delicious dish. So, during the meal, he asked his mother, "What is this? It's so delicious!"

His mother replied, "It's cuttlefish, also called inkfish."

"Then what do they look like? I've never seen one before. Can you tell me roughly?"

"Their bodies are very soft, and they have two distinct parts: the head and the torso. Head: They have big eyes on both sides of their head. Yes, there is a mouth on top of their head? Inside the mouth is a horny tooth tongue, and around the mouth are ten fleshy feet. When they crawl, they use the many suckers on the inside of their feet. When they catch food, they use the two longest ones. Torso: Outside the torso, there is a sac-like mantle. It secretes a piece of oval-shaped bone called cuttlebone, which can quickly stop bleeding when we are cut by a knife. When they swim, they rely on the fleshy feet on their heads and the inner fins on both sides of their torso."

"If they encounter animals that are bigger than them, what do they use to resist?"

"If they are attacked, they have two methods: ㊀ Under their ventral side, there is an ink sac, which contains a lot of ink. When attacked, they release the ink, so the seawater becomes turbid, the attacking animal can't see their movements, and they escape quickly. ㊁ There are pigment cells on the outside of their mantle. After encountering an enemy, they can immediately change the color of the outside of their body to another color and take the opportunity to swim to another place to hide."

"Besides eating them and the use of cuttlebone, what are they used for?"

"After their meat is dried, it is called cuttlefish jerky, and the black juice in the ink sac can also be made into pigment. Their shells can be used for medicinal purposes."

### Future Chinese Children

— Ba Ling

"Future Chinese children," which path should they also take? This is a topic to be discussed today.

I believe that "future Chinese children" should identify the following goals, bravely move forward, and advance courageously. Only in this way can they be new Chinese children, Chinese children who are living in extraordinary times.

㊀ Strive for physical health: — Europeans and Americans often mock us, saying, "Chinese people are sick men of East Asia, and Chinese children are sick children of East Asia!" These two sentences truly have a full meaning of insult. In this extraordinary period, under the serious situation of national crisis, adults should of course actively engage in physical training, but children should especially strive for physical health. It must be known that only with a healthy spirit can we do great undertakings; only with a healthy body can we engage in the work of national rejuvenation. Children are the roots and seedlings of the country, the pillars of the nation. This point must not be overlooked!

㊁ Strive for scientific research: — Everyone knows that the present is a scientific world, a scientific era. The strength of European and American countries and the development of all undertakings are completely built on the foundation of "science." Now we want national rejuvenation, national strength, and washing away national humiliation. We must put in some effort in scientific research. I hope that children will not regard science as a daunting task, thinking that studying science is a boring thing. It must be known that all interest comes from science. As long as you study diligently, interest will naturally follow.

㊁ Pay attention to the cultivation of morality: — Future Chinese children must not only have healthy bodies and scientific minds, but also have good morals. In the negative aspect, they should have neat and clean habits; in the positive aspect, they should especially have the spirit of courage and struggle. Only by advancing in both directions can good morals be cultivated.

I believe that the above three goals are the path that "future Chinese children" should take. I hope, dear children, that from today, the first day of the Republic of China's twenty-sixth year, you will strive to implement them!

Physics Little Knowledge

### Why is water transparent? Why is snow opaque?

— He Zixiang

Children! It's winter, and the mercury in the thermometer has dropped below zero. We are wearing cotton clothes and绒衣 (a type of woolen underwear) and still feel cold, so we have to warm ourselves around the stove.

The flowing river water has already frozen; the turbid world has been covered with a layer of clean and bright white snow.

Children, we know that rain is water that has been heated, vaporized, and risen, and then encountered cold air in the sky, condensing into droplets. When several small droplets gather, they become a larger droplet, which falls to the ground as rain.

Snow: Children, do you know how it is formed?

Water droplets that remain in the air encounter the attack of colder weather, and they condense into hail or water; hail or water, when they encounter even colder weather, are dissected into flakes of snow.

Children: Do you like to play with water? Do you love to tread in the snow? Water is transparent, and snow is opaque. What is the reason for this?

Snow is a fragment of water, as mentioned above. Comparing the surface of snow with the surface of water, snow is larger. Therefore, the light reflected by the surface is also more; and the gaps between the snowflakes retain air. The light that penetrates is partially transmitted and then undergoes total reflection in the air. Therefore, it will not be transparent and appears white.

### Conduction

— Zhen

The weather is getting colder day by day. A thick layer of ice has formed in the house, not to mention the cold outside. Min'er's house seems particularly cold because it is close to the wilderness, with vast land and few people.

Min'er is a child who likes cleanliness very much. When he gets up every morning, washing his face and rinsing his mouth are of course essential, but he also has a very good habit! He must first examine his hair and nails. One day, his nails grew long, so he went to get a pair of scissors to trim them. When he picked up the scissors, he felt that they were particularly cold today, chilling to the bone. And he remembered very clearly that last summer, he felt that they were very warm. This made him puzzled. So he went to consult his problem solver — his brother Cong'er — and asked him to answer this question.

"Brother, this is a very good question. You need to know that scissors are metal, and metal is a good conductor. What is a good conductor? A good conductor is something that, when one end is burned, the heat from the burning end can be transmitted to the entire object. In winter, the outside air is definitely much colder than your body temperature. If your hand touches the metal, the metal will quickly transfer the heat from your hand to the cold air, so your hand feels cold. You should also know that hot air mixes easily with cold air because hot air is lighter than cold air. But in summer, the temperature of the air is higher than the temperature of your body, and the metal can quickly transfer the heat of the air to your hand, so your hand feels hot."

"Brother, how do you know that metal is a good conductor of heat? Are there any other things that are poor conductors of heat?"

"I used to have the same question and asked our teacher, so he showed us an experiment: He took a four-inch-long iron rod and put one end on a lamp to burn for a few minutes, and the end of the rod that he was holding gradually got hot, which shows that heat is transferred from one end to the other end. Anything that has this situation is a good conductor. Glass, air, etc. are poor conductors, but these good conductors and poor conductors are compared to each other."

### Please Continue Your Efforts to Support the Suiyuan Region During the Winter Vacation

— Wei Ji

Children! The annual winter vacation has arrived, and everyone will have another happy winter vacation at home!

However, with the country facing hardship and the insurgents disturbing the Suiyuan border, every Chinese citizen should contribute to supporting Suiyuan. Those with money should donate money, and those with strength should contribute their strength. Everyone should be of one mind and constantly engage in supporting Suiyuan! We children are of course all citizens, so why don't we take advantage of the vacation to work hard to support Suiyuan and save the country?

Although the support work you children have done in the past has been very enthusiastic: some have been frugal with their clothing and food, some have saved pocket money, some have raised clothes and donated money, and some even have poor children reducing their food and saving money. These many different ways of supporting Suiyuan have given the country a lot of help and are of course worthy of everyone's praise! But we should know that if the unrest on the Suiyuan border does not stop for a day, our support work cannot stop for a day! Moreover, in the past, everyone was limited by time because they were studying at school and could not work very hard. Now that the winter vacation has arrived, our support work must continue to be strengthened and expanded!

Children! I sincerely hope that you will continue to work hard to support Suiyuan! Expand your work! And only stop when the insurgents are completely eliminated! Now we have a very long vacation to use, which is a great opportunity for everyone to work hard to support Suiyuan. I hope you don't just be lazy and miss it!

### Little Blackie

— Jiang Yuqi

㊀ Little Blackie always bullies us. Today, let's think of a way to warn him. ㊁ Saw Little Blackie walking on the road, and threw a stone on his forehead. ㊂ Little Blackie chased over angrily to hit him. ㊃ The child released the rope on the prank catapult, pressing Little Blackie and causing him to tumble head over heels.

### Winter Vacation

— Chen Jianju

Say goodbye!

Everyone is parting ways from now on.

Think carefully:

Have the teacher's instructions

Been followed without fail?

Time flies and never returns,

Strive diligently and do not waste it.

During the vacation:

Get up early and don't be greedy for sleep,

Exercise for an hour,

Your spirit will be ten times stronger;

Read books and write after meals,

Read the children's supplement, "It's really interesting."

Don't be naughty,

Don't be hypocritical,

We will rely on ourselves to save the country in the future.

"If you don't work hard when you are young,

You will only be sad when you are old."

### Toy Lending Places to Make Children Happy

— Te

To give every girl a doll, and every boy a toy, just like borrowing books from a public library. This is an initiative of the Los Angeles Regional Association two years ago to make boys and girls happy. The leaders of the association, because of the economic downturn in the market in recent years, many children do not even have enough food and clothing, let alone toys. But toys are as precious as food and clothing in the eyes of children. Therefore, they came up with a relief plan and organized a toy lending place in cooperation with educational groups, civil organizations, and sympathetic people, imitating the public library's method of borrowing books with cards. Every registered applicant can borrow a doll for two weeks. The loan can be renewed when it expires, but unlike the library, if it is not returned when it expires, or it is returned damaged, a fine must be paid, because this kind of punishment is not suitable for children. There is also a preferential measure: every girl can choose one favorite doll from dozens of dolls. After "raising" her for two weeks, she must send it back to the lending place for inspection. If it is proved that she is a "good mother", she can keep her for another two weeks. After the expiration date, send it back for inspection again. If she is still tidy, she can "raise" her for another six weeks. After six weeks, if the inspection proves that she is indeed a "good mother," she can keep the doll forever as her own. This method can encourage and cultivate children's habit of cherishing things.

Where do the required dolls come from? They are all donated by wealthy families. Movie star Ms. Hill donated more than 200 dolls from her doll room to the lending place alone. The doll that a girl keeps permanently is considered her adopted child, and a certificate must be filled out and sent to the donor. Because this method is very interesting, everyone is happy to donate when donating dolls, and more than 1,000 were received at once.

If the lending place rents another house, the cost will be too high. So they negotiated with public schools and libraries to borrow their extra rooms to set up sub-lending places. Each sub-lending place must first pay 60 yuan to the headquarters of the lending place, or pay 5 yuan per month, because each doll must be disinfected and sorted before it is lent out. This fee is used to pay workers' salaries. The insufficient funds are borne by the local association. As for the staff who manage the lending affairs, some are volunteers and some are given a small transportation fee. Now a house 100 feet wide and 120 feet long has been rented as the main workshop, with 40 workers inside. Every two weeks, the returned dolls are painted and sorted once. They are very busy.

Since this matter was established, the results have been very good. Therefore, people are imitating it everywhere, and the scale has been expanded a lot compared to the initial establishment. The funding is also very sufficient, and the National Youth Affairs Office and the local municipal government are helping to carry out everything.

What is said above is the method of making female children happy. As for male children, dolls are not suitable, so many boys' toys, such as small bicycles and ice skates, have been raised separately. It is also based on the method of lending dolls, and if there is no damage after six weeks, it belongs to the borrower. There are now 3,000 registration cards for the Los Angeles lending place. Last year, there were a total of 41,000 loans. From February to the end of June, the age of the borrowers in five months was mostly between 4 and 10 years old, according to the charter, from 2 years old to 17 years old. The area of Los Angeles is 4.5 million miles, and there are now 6 sub-lending places.

We children from poor families probably also hope that there will be such a lending place in our local area. The reporter is very willing for enthusiastic people who care about children's entertainment to initiate this initiative.

### Righteousness (Two)

— Qing

Just as a large wave had passed, another one followed, pushing the sailing boat forward, bringing it even closer to the small reef. The captain, Begg, seeing that there was little hope, issued an order, telling the sailors to abandon ship and try to reach the small reef. To his surprise, the sailors refused to obey, shouting in unison that they would not leave the broken ship unless the captain led the way to safety. The captain calmly repeated his order, telling them that his own life was of least importance and would be the last to be considered. Seeing the captain's firm attitude, the sailors had to obey his command, leaving the broken ship in an orderly manner, as if the ship were entering the harbor and everyone was disembarking safely. However, they were all numb with cold, and many could not climb onto the reef, being swept away by the waves. Sadly, the first mate also perished in this way. Captain Begg, seeing that everyone had left, was the last to leave the broken ship. He saw that the shore was not far away, but the tide was rising, and he predicted that soon the reef they were standing on would be submerged. However, there were no signs of people on this coast, and the fog was very thick. It seemed that the whole group would be swallowed by the high tide, with no hope of rescue.

That courageous crew member still silently and tightly held onto the rope, determined to rescue his comrades. He earnestly prayed, tied the rope around his waist, and struggled through the raging tide, finally reaching the shore. He immediately turned back and loudly informed his comrades that he had safely landed.

Now, a rope stretched between the shore and the reef, its length just right for two people to hold on to from each side. Their only hope was to cling to the rope and risk climbing ashore. The rising tide had already reached the hands of the sailors crouching on the reef, but no one rushed to go first. Captain Begg still called out their names one by one, asking them to climb the rope in order. They still pleaded with the captain to go first, but the captain firmly replied, "I will not leave this reef until everyone has safely reached the shore."

### Hong Kong-Shanghai Wireless Telephone Successfully Tested Yesterday

Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Newspaper Sends Congratulations and Wishes of Health to Colleagues in Shanghai

The Hong Kong-Shanghai wireless telephone service is scheduled to officially open at 7:00 AM on the first of next month. Mayor Wu and the Governor of Hong Kong will exchange congratulatory messages, and the press will be invited for free. However, a trial call was held between Hong Kong and Shanghai on the 30th. Zhang Zhting, editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Daily, wanting accurate details of the test call, had the newspaper's Shanghai correspondent conduct the first test call from Hong Kong to the Chinese area of ​​this city at 4:50 PM on the 30th. The sound was very clear, no different from the sound of an automatic telephone in this city. It is believed that the official call will be a great success. In addition to exchanging greetings with the reporter, Zhang also instructed him to extend wishes of health to colleagues in this city and to unite as a nation to save the country through public opinion. A news item from Hong Kong was also relayed, which is recorded below. The Hong Kong Changmen Reservoir, which has been under construction for a long time, was officially opened at 3:00 PM on the 30th. The Governor of Hong Kong personally attended the ceremony. The Guangdong Provincial Government, the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, and the provincial and municipal party departments all sent representatives to Hong Kong to participate. The ceremony was very grand. The reservoir is the most significant project in Hong Kong. Before its completion, the water levels of various reservoirs in Hong Kong would be affected during the hot summer months if rainfall decreased, making it impossible to supply the entire Hong Kong population. Therefore, the opening hours of tap water were controlled, and street-side water pipes were also restricted, but the opening hours were slightly longer to accommodate residents. Under the sweltering heat, the demand for water for cooking and bathing would inevitably increase, causing concerns about water shortages. As a result, many residents would fetch water from public water pipes on the streets, often resulting in fights in the rush. After the completion of the reservoir, which has a storage capacity of 300 million gallons, water shortages will no longer occur during the opening, and the suffering of residents due to water shortages will be reduced. The people of Hong Kong are all overjoyed, considering it truly a blessing.

### Shanghai-Hunan Wireless Telephone Service to Open Tomorrow

### Mr. Pan Gongzhan Lectures on "Unification and Peace"

Four to Five Hundred Listeners, Elaboration Lasts More Than Two Hours

According to the National Society, the Shanghai YMCA held a special lecture on the Unification and National Salvation Movement at the YMCA Auditorium at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Mr. Pan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, was invited to lecture on the topic of "Unification and Peace." Mr. Pan vividly elaborated on the meaning of unification, the hope for peace, the connection between unification and peace, and the historical facts of unification and peace in various countries, both domestic and foreign. He also corrected the errors of contemporary people regarding unification and national salvation and pointed out the direction of effort for the people of the country. The lecture lasted an hour and a half. Four to five hundred listeners were very excited. Mr. Pan's speech briefly stated that unification and peace are like the two pans of a balance, and the two have a natural connection.

First, let me discuss peace. Peace is the most pressing need for our country at present. This can be explained in two points: (1) Human nature and the national character of our country both love peace. The ancient saying goes, "The greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life." The character for "nature" [性] is the character for "life" [生] with the heart radical [心]. Humans are the most intelligent of all things and naturally love life. Only peace can ensure survival. When the spring breeze is gentle, plants and trees can sprout. From the perspective of our country's history, we have always advocated "continuing the interrupted lineage, reviving the destroyed state, and being generous in giving and frugal in receiving." The kindness and benevolence of ancient China, which governed the world with kingly ways, cannot be compared to modern imperialists. (2) In the process of the past twenty years since the Xinhai Revolution, we have felt the need for peace even more deeply. Since the demise of the Qing Dynasty, warlords have divided and occupied the country, and the people have lived in deep water and scorching fire every day. Who does not want to quickly turn swords into plowshares and achieve peace so that they can live and work in peace and contentment and strive for construction? If the country does not have peace, there can be no construction. Therefore, the people long for peace as much as a great drought longs for clouds and rain. In fact, in 1936 [Republic Year 25], danger was turned into safety many times. What made this possible? The great power of the entire nation's hope for peace can influence everything. If the entire nation is filled with peace and happiness, the whole country will become prosperous. If struggle and killing fill every unit, what hope is there for the nation? Today, our nation has reached a period of recovery. Therefore, the affairs of humans accord with the times, and there is a phenomenon of long life and abundant harvests. How can we

Achieve Peace? Unification can achieve peace. Without peace, there is war. War arises from separatist forces. Before September 18th [Mukden Incident], there were wars every year because the separatists were eager to act. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms begins by saying, "The general trend of the world is that after a long period of unity, there will be division, and after a long period of division, there will be unity." This statement can encompass our country's past history. What were the national prestige of the Han Wu Emperor era, the national status of the Tang Taizong era, and the situations of the Sixteen Kingdoms, the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the late Yuan Dynasty, and the late Ming Dynasty? When there was division, the people suffered. However, only the unification of Li Shimin [Emperor Taizong of Tang] produced the Zhenguan Reign [period of prosperity], and only the unification of Zhu Yuanzhang [Hongwu Emperor of Ming] produced the early Ming Dynasty's prosperity. Therefore, I dare to conclude that first there must be unification, and then there can be peace. Moreover, if we want to obtain lasting and true peace, the peace obtained through unification is not a superficial peace, but a true peace. Before the Meiji Restoration in Japan, there were frequent domestic disturbances. After the restoration, the abolition of the feudal domains was implemented, all power was concentrated in the central government, the country was unified, and it gradually revived. Therefore, Japan's prosperity is entirely dependent on the abolition of the feudal domains movement, breaking the separatist situation, and achieving successful unification. Japan's success in this unification is based on my Wang Yangming's Confucianism, the so-called Yamato spirit and Bushido, which is actually nothing more than

Revering the King and Expelling the Barbarians. Revering the King and Expelling the Barbarians is our country's treasure. Confucius' spirit in compiling the Spring and Autumn Annals is precisely this: to revere the central government, to expel the Hu people. The new term for "revering the king" is unifying under the central government, and the new term for "expelling the barbarians" is resisting the enemy. Therefore, revering the king and expelling the barbarians is not an antique concept; it is what is called unifying to resist the enemy, but it cannot be reversed and called expelling the barbarians to revere the king, because only by revering the king can one expel the barbarians, and only by unifying can one resist the enemy. This is a matter of course. Unification is what is called internal stability, and resisting the enemy is what is called external defense. Only by achieving internal stability can we defend against external threats; only after unification can we have the strength to resist the enemy and achieve peace. German Chancellor Bismarck established a unified Prussian Federation with Prussia as the center, and only then could the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars be won. The three heroes of Italian nation-building devoted their lives to merging dozens of small states and establishing a unified new country, which is why it has the status it has today. Is this not the power of unification?

Before September 18th, the historical reality of our country should not be blamed on others; it was the inevitability of history. The rapid success of the Xinhai Revolution cannot be entirely attributed to the revolutionaries; it was the natural course of history. Since the unification of China by Qin Shi Huang, commercial capital has gradually developed, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed rural producers. At the appropriate time, the unemployed riot. Our country has had seven or eight such cyclical riots since ancient times. Foreign countries transport the unemployed to colonies to settle them, while our country, after two or three hundred years, sees an increase in the number of unemployed, the central government loses control, and riots recur. The late Qing Dynasty reached this stage. Although the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, the era of the collapse of the central government had not yet passed, so warlords divided and occupied the country. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Republic of China, not the Chinese Empire, so the warlords did not dare to call themselves kings and cause chaos; this was a great blessing. From

Historical Review, we can see that peace could not be achieved before September 18th. However, after the heroes divided and occupied the country, they would inevitably be unified into one. Mencius said, "The situation will be settled in two." Therefore, without unification, there can be no peace. After division, there must still be unification. However, seeking unification from the warlords is an impossible fact. Therefore, to seek peace, we need to eliminate the separatist forces of the warlords and support unification. We dare to conclude that there is no way to seek true peace except through unification. If we want peace, we must first unify. Some people say that to seek peace, unification is not necessary; there are other methods to consider, such as seeking peace through alliance. How is this prescription? Please elaborate. The English word "United" means "alliance" and can also be said to mean "unification." The two words "United Front" can be translated as

United Front, which is also called unified front. However, there is a difference between alliance and unification. The unification in our country's history has always been a single unit. The permanent maintenance of our nation is based on this spirit. If peace can be sought through alliance, why did the provincial autonomy movement in 1920 [Republic Year 8] not succeed? The union of military governors in 1915 [Republic Year 4] also failed to achieve peace because it was against unification. Opposition to unification means no peace. Seeking peace through alliance is sugar-coated poison. Some people say that foreign countries also have alliances, such as the United States of America. However, after the establishment of the United States, the army, finance, and diplomacy are all in the hands of the central government. Is it like the North China region in our country, which also has a Foreign Affairs Committee? We seek unification to eliminate separatist forces. There are two methods: war and peace. Emperor Taizu of Song [Zhao Kuangyin] released his generals from military command over a cup of wine, which was a peaceful method of seeking peace. There are countless examples of seeking peace through war. The Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was to seek unification through war and to seek peace through unification. Now the National Government is using peaceful methods to seek unification, but the strength of the central government is not enough. It must rely on the strength of the people to preserve the army,

Eliminate the System, and have the people assist the central government in supervising the military so that they do not interfere in local politics. The National Army is transferred by the central government at any time, and the army and the commanders do not have a fixed relationship. In this way, the elimination of separatism can be achieved through peaceful methods. Seeking unification through peace, seeking peace through unification, and the success of the unification and national salvation movement will bring prosperity to the country.

### Public Concession Water Price Increase, Various Groups Hold a Meeting Yesterday to Oppose

Decide to Appoint Committee to Form Research Association, Issue Declaration and Petition the Municipal Government for Negotiation

According to the New Sound Society, after the Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British-owned company in the Public Concession, decided to increase the water price from February 1st, changing the 25% discount to a 20% discount according to the company's original price list, various sectors expressed opposition. Various groups, including the First Special District Citizens' Association of this city, held a joint meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the First Special District Citizens' Association, the Real Estate Industry Association, the Tenants Association, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the General Labor Union, the Women's Association, the Education Association, and various district branches, including Yu Zhenhui, Li Ao Kui, Zhu Xuefan, Zhu Qizhen, Lin Kecong, Xu Xiaochu, Wan Futian, Liu Zhongying, Wang Manyun, Zhu Zhichun, and others, totaling over a hundred people, elected Li Ao Kui, Cao Zhigong, Yu Zhenhui, Chen Jiufeng, and Chen Weiwen as the presidium.

Resolutions

After the customary formalities, Chairman Li Ao Kui reported the purpose of the meeting. Shi Cizhou, representative of the Real Estate Industry Association, reported on the company's price increase situation. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) The Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British-owned company in the Public Concession, has suddenly increased its price, which the citizens cannot afford. A petition should be submitted to the municipal government for serious negotiation to maintain the original price. (2) A letter should be sent to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to argue strongly on reasonable grounds. (3) A letter should be sent to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to review and cancel the price increase and to audit the company's accounts over the years. (4) All users should be notified to deposit all water fees at the original price in the bank before the case is resolved. (5) A committee should be organized to study the water supply problem. (6) A declaration should be issued.

Committee Formation

Twenty-one committee members were appointed to form the Water Supply Problem Research Committee. The list is as follows: Yu Zhenhui, Zhu Xuefan, Cao Zhigong, Chen Jicheng, Li Ao Kui, Chen Jiufeng, Zhu Yangwu, Zhu Qizhi, Chen Weiwen, Zhu Zhichun, Qiu Jialiang, Lin Kecong, Ye Qichang, Wang Manyun, He Yuanming, Zhang Xianfang, Liu Zhongying, Shi Ruozhou, Zhang Yilu, Gu Wensheng, Wan Futian. Li Ao Kui was appointed as the convener, and Zhu Yutao was appointed as the secretary-general of the committee. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 2:00 PM on February 3rd and will invite water supply experts to conduct joint research.

Issuance of Declaration

"Since the Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British-owned company, disregarding the difficult times, vaguely requested the approval of the Public Works Department to increase the water price, and decided to increase the water price from February 1st of this year, changing the 25% discount to a 20% discount according to the company's original price list, users who heard the news were deeply indignant. This association and others have specially convened a joint meeting and unanimously decided to oppose it and requested the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to review and cancel it. Before the case is resolved, the original price will be deposited in the bank. Water is an indispensable necessity for human life. Because rivers in cities are being filled in, residents' drinking water is entirely supplied by tap water. This kind of public utility serves the public and aims at public welfare, which goes without saying. However, the British-owned Waterworks Company engages in speculation and monopoly. In recent years, it has repeatedly increased prices. Before 1928 [Republic Year 17], fees were mostly collected according to rent, first at 5% and then at 6%, which did not cause much harm to users. However, in the spring of 1928 [Republic Year 17], the then-General Manager of the Public Works Department, Mr. Fessenden, concluded a new contract with the company, promising to guarantee interest. Because the company was guaranteed interest, it arbitrarily expanded and issued bonus shares, and frequently increased prices, ordering users to bear the company's huge expenses. Subsequently, the company added new regulations for users to install meters for calculation, setting high prices and harsh methods, which is particularly regrettable. In recent years, this city has been hit by a wave of depression, and the market has declined, and industry and commerce have withered, which is a visible fact. However, the company authorities suddenly took this opportunity to vaguely request the Public Works Department to change the discount and implement a price increase, insisting on going its own way, only seeking profit. Is there still any talk of serving the society? It must be known that the rise and fall of exchange rates are uncertain. Now, the company wants to increase the price because the exchange rate has fallen. Then, why not mention a decrease when it was high before? As for the company's huge expenses, this is the biggest reason for the company's poverty. At this time of hardship, why doesn't the company eliminate redundant personnel and strive to economize to achieve financial rationality? Instead, it fails to come up with this plan and continues to increase the burden on users as a basis for the company's surplus and dividends. Can this kind of policy be sustained? This is a special and solemn declaration, respectfully urging the company authorities to think from the perspective of serving the society, to immediately cancel the agreement to increase the price, and hoping that all compatriots will adhere to their original intentions and wait patiently for a resolution. This is the declaration."

### Hubei Cultural Circles Endorse the Unification and National Salvation Declaration

The Hubei Branch of the China Cultural Construction Association telegraphed the Shanghai General Association yesterday, saying, "Without unification, there is no way to resist foreign aggression; without construction, there is no way to seek survival. This is a consensus recognized by the entire nation. At a time when ambitious warlords are stirring up chaos in Shaanxi and Gansu, and the remaining bandits are inciting drug use in the Northwest, if they are not quickly suppressed, a single spark can start a prairie fire. The speech made by your association at this time is very necessary to set the trend. This branch hereby represents the Hubei cultural circles in unanimous endorsement. Please note. The Hubei Branch of the China Cultural Construction Association bows in gratitude."

### Citizens' Association Sends Letter to Bankers' Association Requesting Cessation of Uncontrolled Issuance of Checks

Banks Use Acceptance of Deposits as a Method, Allowing Speculators to Deceive Goods and Defraud Money

The First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Bankers' Association yesterday, stating, "According to a letter from the Fourth District Branch of this association, a general new or old silver company in the city disregards commercial ethics, only cares about greed for profit, and can receive a check by receiving a very low deposit of 50 or 100 yuan without the need for a guarantee, openly publishing advertisements to solicit deposits, intending to deceive with such people, speculators rely on it to deceive goods and defraud money, and issue bad checks everywhere. When it comes to the time for cashing out, nine out of ten are returned, causing the check holder to have no way to recover. In extreme cases, lawsuits are filed according to law, which are delayed for a long time, and merchants suffer pain and losses. Therefore, we specially request your association to investigate, supervise, and urge the banking industry to take care of credit and not issue checks indiscriminately to alleviate the difficulties of merchants."

### Zhejiang and Jiangxi Yumin Banks Implement Interbank Remittance

Hangzhou and Six Other Locations Accept Auxiliary Currency Notes

According to the New Sound Society, in order to facilitate the economic communication between the two provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi and develop agriculture, industry, and commerce, the Zhejiang Local Bank and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank have signed a contract to mutually remit and exchange auxiliary currency notes.

It has also obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to issue auxiliary currency notes totaling 3 million yuan, in denominations of 1 jiao, 2 jiao, and 5 jiao. Originally scheduled for issuance on New Year's Day this year, it was subsequently delayed because the Ministry ordered that for the sake of unifying the issuance of auxiliary currency notes by provincial banks, the printing should be handled by the Ministry of Finance. The bank immediately complied, and it is expected that the printing will be completed next month. The issuance is scheduled for March 1st.

### Overseas Chinese from Siam, Xu Geding, Returned to China Yesterday for Investigation

Also Plans to Negotiate the Establishment of the China-Siam Association and Prepare for the Establishment of the Bangkok China National Products Company

Mr. Xu Geding, an overseas Chinese from Siam, has resided in Siam for many years and is highly respected by both the local overseas Chinese community and the Siamese government. He holds several positions, including member of the Executive Committee of the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, secretary of the China-Siam Association, and principal of the Bangkok Chinese Middle School. This time, urged by various parties, he returned to China yesterday, arriving in Shanghai on a Canadian ship and staying at the Dadong Hotel. It is understood that Mr. Xu's mission in returning to China has approximately three points: ① To investigate domestic industries. China-Siam trade has always been developed, but in recent years, due to the intense dumping of Japanese goods and Siam's efforts at independent development, China's trade with Siam has gradually declined. The Siam Investigation Group led by Ling Bing and Lin Kanghou also deeply felt the need for China-Siam trade after arriving in Siam and actively sought ways to reverse the decline. At that time, the establishment of the China-Siam Association was planned, with Mr. Xu serving as secretary. When Mr. Gao Shiheng led the Nanyang Commercial Investigation Group to Siam, they discussed with Mr. Xu several times and increasingly felt the precariousness of China-Siam trade. In addition to diplomatic negotiations between the two governments, the industrial and commercial circles at home and abroad should also communicate with each other and work together. Mr. Gao asked Mr. Xu to continue his efforts in Siam to establish the China-Siam Association, and also asked him to return to China for investigation, in order to more thoroughly understand the current state of domestic construction and industry and commerce. ② To establish the China-Siam Association. The China-Siam Association has been in preparation for several months, with the domestic headquarters in Nanjing and the Siamese headquarters in Bangkok, with Mr. Xu serving as secretary. Mr. Xu believes that the progress of the association's affairs requires a great deal of contact with the government and industrial and commercial circles, so he had no choice but to return to China in the hope of preparing properly and establishing the association as soon as possible. ③ To prepare for the establishment of the Bangkok China National Products Company. When Mr. Gao Shiheng led the Nanyang Commercial Investigation Group south, it was originally intended to establish China National Products Companies in various places as a permanent mechanism for the Southward sales of national products, in addition to the exhibition. However, due to the circumstances, it was not easy to discuss in the Philippines and Java. Only in Singapore has contact been made with some prospects. In the Siamese capital, he had several contacts with Mr. Xu and other overseas Chinese leaders. Both sides felt the need. Mr. Xu has already raised 70,000 yuan locally and is preparing for establishment. He has come to Shanghai to contact the Joint Office of China National Products to establish close ties in order to actively proceed. He also plans to join the China National Products Joint Company, so he will go to Beijing in the next few days to meet with Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry to discuss everything. It is also heard that the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association has scheduled a banquet for Mr. Xu at Guanshengyuan on February 1st, where domestic and foreign industrial and commercial figures will gather to exchange views on promoting foreign trade over drinks.

### Detailed Record of the Shanghai Literary and Art Community Forum

Central News Agency reports: On the 29th of this month, Shanghai literary and art writers Hong Shen, Fu Donghua, Shao Xunmei, Ye Lingfeng, Hu Zhongchi, Gu Zhongyi, and others invited the city's literary and art community to hold a forum, which was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. More than eighty writers, including Li Qingya and Fu Yanchang, attended. Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Hong Ruizhao, and others were also invited to attend. During the meeting, the writers expressed many opinions, especially elaborating on the aspects that the literary and art community should work on in the future. The整理ed record of the forum is as follows (the recorder is responsible for any errors):

Shao Xunmei: Almost all of the literary and art friends we invited today have arrived. We feel very honored. Now, on behalf of the six hosts, I will briefly explain the purpose of today's meeting. Most of the friends present today are literary and art writers. These two words "writer" seem to have become a joke. On the one hand, we should blame others for being bad, but on the other hand, we ourselves inevitably have some shortcomings that make people laugh. For many years, the literary and art community has never gained a considerable position in society. The reason is that in the past, most people who wrote literary and art works either praised others or used them as their own pastimes. Now the times have changed, and literary people have more opportunities to contact society. In the past, literary people were considered boring, but now literary people have become interesting and become freelancers. Because they have become freelancers, they must also have an organization like a trade union, so we have a proposal to organize the China Literary and Art Association. In the past, the Shanghai Writers Association and the Writers' Union have been organized several times, but they have never yielded results. Of course, the writers themselves should bear some responsibility, because various intentions were often mixed in this kind of group, so there was no result. The first meaning of our six people inviting you to the meeting today is to hope that in this gathering, we can organize a sound literary and art association and seek a sincere unity of literary and art workers. The second point, as I just said, we are freelancers. According to the latest laws and regulations, people with occupations have to bear income tax. The income tax paid by the freelance industry is particularly heavy, accounting for about 20 percent. This issue is too closely related to our own interests. At the same time, a part of the publishing industry, which has no morals, specializes in printing pirated books. This matter has greatly affected writers in an invisible way. Every pirated book that is published means one less original book. This is also a matter of great concern to writers. Therefore, the second meaning of today's meeting is to discuss how to protect the interests of literary and art writers themselves. Furthermore, we also have a major responsibility at present, which is to be responsible for our own country. In recent years, our country has shown very good signs. The unification that has not been completed for many years has now been roughly completed. Our general literary and art friends should express some opinions, on the one hand, to give those who cannot write articles a considerable understanding, and on the other hand, to encourage our government and be the backing of the government. Now all parties have issued declarations on the unification and national salvation movement. The Shanghai literary and art community has not yet expressed its views, so our six people have prepared a declaration on the unification and national salvation movement for the Shanghai literary and art community. Please consider it and feel free to discuss any additions or deletions. The above points are the reason why our six people convened this forum. Today, it happens that Mr. Fang Xikong, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, is passing through Shanghai. Mr. Fang used to work hard in the literary and art movement, so today we take the opportunity to invite Mr. Fang to participate in this meeting in his personal capacity and express some opinions. Because Mr. Fang has come from afar, let's first ask Mr. Fang to express his opinions.

Fang Zhi: Six hosts, ladies and gentlemen, I am passing through Shanghai on my way to Hangzhou for business. It just so happens that the six hosts invited literary and art colleagues to gather together. I cannot write and have no artistic talent. I feel very honored and excited to be able to participate in this grand event, especially after hearing Mr. Shao's report, which are all issues worth studying and require your comments. In recent years, our literary and art colleagues have been constantly working hard for Chinese literature and art, and the environment in which the literary and art community is currently located is still inevitably difficult. The work I am in charge of is also engaged in cultural undertakings like everyone else. Our goals and interests can be said to be completely the same, so the difficulties that you think need to be resolved, I should also follow you and work hard together and try to resolve them. I often have a feeling that a strong country must rely on material construction on the one hand, and spiritual construction on the other. Spiritual construction, especially cultural undertakings, is of the utmost importance. In any strong country, its cultural development must be advancing in parallel with material development. With these two forces, the foundation of the country can be consolidated. In recent years, our cultural undertakings in the field of spiritual construction have been progressing year by year. The development of cultural undertakings can promote the development of material, which is a fact and does not need to be listed. To take a small thing as an example, on my way to Shanghai this time, I accidentally bought a national conditions pictorial on the train. After reading it once, I felt very excited. I didn't know who was in charge of this pictorial before. As soon as I opened this book, I could fully see that China is a country of revival, with citizen training, mass training, national army, and the situation of Suiyuan's resistance to the enemy, and so on. After reading it, every reader can feel very excited and nervous, and can know that China is gradually having a way now, as long as we bury our heads and work hard. This is just an example I thought of by chance. From this, we can know that spiritual construction and cultural undertakings have a great relationship. Therefore, I feel that to ask China to build a new China, we must work hard on the new cultural movement. Spiritual construction is above all else. With spiritual construction, material construction is not a problem. I hope everyone will work hard together. Secondly, I am a member of the central cultural undertaking. I hope that everyone will contribute opinions to the central government, so that the cultural undertakings that the central government urgently needs to promote and the local cultural undertakings can be integrated to jointly develop China's cultural undertakings. This is my greatest wish. Shanghai is the cultural center of China. You are almost all leaders of the national literary and art community. I would very much like to hear your opinions on cultural undertakings, especially the literary and art movement in the future. Now I don't want to waste your precious time. After you express your opinions, if I have any opinions, I will contribute a little bit. Please give me your advice. (To be continued)

### Special Cash Guarantee Measures (Continued)

Full Text Released by the Banking Association

The Meaning of Type A, B, and C Guarantees and Their Payment Methods

Type A Guarantee (3 Months' Salary): After the cancellation of guarantors, a corresponding guarantee deposit must be paid to serve as a guarantee. To increase protection, it was originally possible to stipulate the payment of one year's or half a year's salary. However, fearing that employees would not be able to raise funds during this period of social and economic hardship, the amount was adjusted to three times the monthly salary. This is easier than finding a guarantor and will greatly increase interest rates. Half of the interest will still be paid to the employee. In this way, the guarantee deposit is equivalent to savings and will not be wasted. Half of it will be allocated to the public reserve fund, and the principal will be stored separately and returned in full when the employee leaves the bank. For payment methods, in order to facilitate fundraising, it can be paid according to the following methods:

For current employees, the following three methods can be used to raise and pay the guarantee deposit: (A) One-third will be allocated from the employee's existing savings (if the bank does not have employee savings, it can be paid half and half from items B and C). (B) One-third will be allocated from the year-end bonus (pre-appropriated at the time of implementation). (C) One-third will be paid in installments (the time limit is determined by the bank).

New Employees: Pay in full at once.

Type B Guarantee (2% of Monthly Salary): This is a substitute for the cancellation of guarantors, and is equivalent to the insurance premium for group credit insurance. It does not need to be refunded. However, out of consideration for the employees, it can be refunded in full when they leave the bank if no fraud has occurred, or the balance can be recovered after compensation. This combines the intention of savings with the guarantee. It is called "guaranteed savings." The limit is also extremely low. The payment method is as follows: (A) In banks that have already established employee savings, 2% can be allocated from the monthly savings. (B) Deduct from the monthly salary on a monthly basis.

Type C Guarantee: If the bank suffers losses due to employee fraud, the bank is not without responsibility. Therefore, the bank stipulates that several tens of thousands of yuan will be allocated each year. The amount can be based on the sum of half of the interest on the Type A guarantee and the full amount of the Type B guarantee as a standard. It is used as a Type C guarantee to strengthen the guarantee force, to show that it cooperates with the employees and shares the joys and sorrows. The allocation method is (A) Allocate a fixed amount from the expenditure item (paying the employee's Type C guarantee is equivalent to the insurance premium for group credit insurance). (B) Verify and allocate from the surplus item (extracting employee guarantee reserves).

From the above, it can be proved that when the special cash guarantee method is implemented, the payment of the Type A guarantee is not slightly difficult. The refund of the Type B guarantee has a positive effect, and the employees feel the same sense of self-interest in order to eliminate the motive for fraud. It is not like the insurance premium paid to a credit insurance company, which is like a donation and is indifferent. The Type C guarantee is the bank's determination to improve the guarantee system in order to strengthen the guarantee force. In a considerable period of time, the bank can verify and propose a certain amount to organize employee welfare facilities to improve the employees' morality, intelligence, physique, and group cultivation.

This method also stipulates "joint and several punishments" to promote the spirit of internal restraint, and "rewarding whistleblowing" to achieve the effect of preventing in advance and achieve the purpose of preventing fraud. Therefore, although the Type A guarantee is three times the monthly salary, it does not lose the effectiveness of the entire guarantee, and the payment of the Type B guarantee is the essence of this method.

Advantages of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method"

I. For Banks:

First, after the implementation of this method, the guarantee reserve fund is indeed available, and the bank can avoid the huge losses suffered by employee fraud every year under the current empty-word insurance policy system.

Second, after the current insurance policy system is abolished, the bank can save the huge expenses incurred each year in the investigation of employee guarantors, guarantee documents, telegrams, letters, etc. (the expenses of various banks in our country are huge every year).

Third, after the current insurance policy system is abolished, the bank can avoid various lawsuits against the guarantor and the guarantor against the fraudster.

Fourth, in order to change the current "unlimited guarantee" to "limited guarantee," the amount of the guarantee must be determined separately and in detail. If the regulations are too small, the protection will be insufficient. If the regulations are too large, the employees may not be able to find a guarantor. The "Special Cash Guarantee Method" also has the effect of mutual supervision in spirit, so there is no such disadvantage of being unevenly weighted.

Fifth, some people say that the current insurance policy system can have the effect of the guarantor supervising the employee. However, according to the facts, more than half of the employee guarantors are not in the same place as the guaranteed employee. According to statistics from a large bank, more than 68% of the guarantors and employees live in different places, that is, the guarantor of A is in B, and the guarantor of B is in C. Moreover, the salary and bank personnel management system values ​​the transfer of employees' duties after a considerable period of time. Therefore, those who serve in Branch A this year may be transferred to Branch B next year. This is always the case, and it is impossible for the guarantor to change with the transfer of the employee. Therefore, the above-mentioned section on the guarantor supervising the employee is not entirely reliable. Moreover, the preparation of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is always available, and the joint and several punishment is far better than the supervision of the guarantor.

Sixth, the implementation of this method can improve the employee's morality and at the same time improve the bank's reputation.

Seventh, because of mutual guarantees and shared interests, all employees can not only scrutinize others at any time, but also be able to restrain themselves and not be tempted by external objects. Even if there is a slight suspicion of impropriety, all colleagues will be afraid of being implicated and will report it together. (To be continued)

### Wu Ziliang and Others Sentenced with Varying Degrees of Imprisonment for Arson for Insurance Money

Zhang Kuibo and Huang Changgen Receive Heavy Sentences; Wu Ziliang Receives a Lighter Sentence; All Others Acquitted

The Menpi Fanfanghua Clothing Company at No. 548 Fuzhou Road was established by the Suzhou brothers Wu Ziliang and Wu Songsen with a capital of 18,000 yuan. It has been in operation for more than five years. It has taken out fire insurance policies with four foreign firms, including Great Britain, Dalailulin, and Dianchang, for a total of 50,000 yuan. Due to poor business and heavy losses, Zhang Kuibo, the accountant from Zhejiang, came up with the idea of arson for insurance money. Zhang found Huang Changgen, a habitual arsonist from Zhenjiang, and obtained the consent of Wu Ziliang. On the night of the 21st of this month, at 2:40 a.m., they filled the store with gasoline and reeds and set it on fire. The Fire Brigade received the report and rushed to extinguish the fire. After the incident, Lu Gengsheng, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Laozha Police Station, and Detective Zhu Shangwu, discovered loopholes and arrested Zhang Kuibo, Wu Ziliang, Huang Changgen, Wu Songsen, and insurance broker Chen Jianian. After interrogation by the First Special District Court, Wu Songsen and Chen Jianian were released on bail, and the others were returned to prison. Qian Hongye, the judge of the criminal court who was hearing the case, went to the scene on Tuesday this week to inspect the scene in order to understand the truth. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the final hearing of the case. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer of the police station, prosecuted according to Article 173 of the Criminal Law, the crime of endangering public safety (the highest sentence is indefinite imprisonment), and did not prosecute Chen Jianian, requesting the revocation of his bail. Hui Ershi, a Westerner from the Far East Public Notary Office of the Fire Brigade, and Hawke, a Westerner, testified about the circumstances of the fire at the time and the reeds and broken pieces of goldfish bowls found at the scene after the incident. Zhang Kuibo and Huang Changgen both confessed to the joint arson, while Wu Ziliang confessed to conspiracy beforehand, and Wu Songsen completely denied it. After the lawyers of both sides argued, Judge Qian announced the verdict in court: Zhang Kuibo was sentenced to nine years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for seven years for jointly setting fire to a building where people were present; Wu Ziliang was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for the same crime; Huang Changgen was sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for ten years for the same crime; Wu Songsen was found not guilty; Chen Jianian was released.

### Girls Awaiting Matching at the Chapei Charity Group's Foster Home

Many Applicants Fail to Qualify; The Home Specifically Announces Regulations

Since the Chapei Charity Group's foster home has had five girls available for marriage, numerous individuals from various quarters have continuously applied for a match. However, due to unqualified family circumstances or incorrect procedures, no matches have been successfully made. To ensure clarity for all sectors, the group has formulated concise regulations for selecting a marriage partner for the fostered girls. These are recorded below: ❶ Women fostered by our home, after being sent from various institutions, will have their photographs taken and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau monthly to be announced in newspapers for family members to claim. If, after one year, no family members come forward, and they are 16 years of age or older, our home will arrange a marriage in accordance with regulations. ❶ For the women being matched by our home, the male applicant must first submit a request letter with an attached photograph, stating his name, place of origin, age, occupation, and address, and come to the home with an introducer before being allowed to view the candidates. Only after both the male applicant and the woman being matched agree, and after the director and supervisors dispatch personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, will the matter be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping. Then, a commercial guarantee must be obtained, and a date selected for the wedding ceremony. Two photographs will be taken at the home, one kept by the home and one given to the married couple for their possession. ❶ The male applicant must pay one hundred silver dollars to subsidize the home's expenses. ❶ The male applicant must have a legitimate occupation and must not abuse the woman after marriage or force her into servitude or sell her. If any violation occurs, the married woman is allowed to report to the home. If our home verifies the evidence, we will send a letter to the authorities for punishment. ❶ If, after one year of fostering, the girl is still unclaimed by her family and is under the age of twelve, individuals with a stable occupation and without children may adopt her as a daughter. They must provide a detailed list of the adopter's name, age, place of origin, address, and occupation, which will be sent to the home by an introducer for verification. A solid commercial guarantee is also required before the girl can be released. ❶ After the girl is released, a charitable fee of a certain amount of silver dollars should be paid based on one's ability to subsidize the home's expenses. ❶ If, after the girl is adopted and released, her biological parents come forward to claim her within one year, they should still be allowed to reunite with their daughter. The adoptive parents must not create difficulties. ❶ The adoptive family must treat the girl as their own child, providing her with good care and not subjecting her to treatment, sale, or servitude. If any violation is discovered, the original guarantor will be held responsible for retrieving the adopted girl and sending her to the authorities for punishment. ❶ If the adopted girl is married, dies from illness, or goes missing, the adoptive family must report it to the home immediately for investigation. ❶ Every spring and autumn, our group will send personnel to conduct investigations of the married women and adopted daughters. The married individuals and the families of the adopted daughters must not refuse under any pretext, to ensure thoroughness.

### Liu Shancai's Crimes Compounded

Sentenced to Two Years and Eight Months; Opium Case Awaiting Sentencing

Liu Yingcai, a fifteen-year-old Sino-Russian mixed-race man from Vladivostok, living at 1291 Route Lafayette, whose father used to work at Customs, and whose sister, named De Fan, works as a dancer, has recently been unemployed. Exploiting his resemblance to Westerners, he impersonated a Western detective and colluded with accomplices Qu Shouyi and Zhang Baoxi, etc., to rob Wang Yushan at No. 2 Renshou Lane, Route Petain, and Hu Ruixiang at No. 105 Gansidong Road, on the pretext of searching for heroin. The victims reported the matter to the French Concession Police, who arrested Liu, Qu, and Zhang and sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. While in custody, Liu, addicted to opium, bribed guard Zhang Shanhe (28 years old, from Zhenjiang) to buy opium bubbles for him to smuggle in and smoke. Another guard discovered this and found five and a half opium bubbles on Liu. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhang Shanhe had purchased them, so Zhang was detained and sent to the French Concession Police Department for investigation and then to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. These matters have already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the robbery case of Liu et al. has been investigated by Judge Sun Penghuan, and the verdict was issued the day before yesterday. Liu Yingcai was sentenced to two years and eight months imprisonment for robbery in a residential area at night with a handgun and for illegally searching others without legal authorization. Qu Shouyi was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Zhang Baoxi's crime could not be proven, and he was declared innocent. Victim Hu Ruixiang filed a civil suit against Liu, and Liu Yingcai was ordered to compensate Hu Ruixiang thirty yuan. Furthermore, regarding the opium case involving Liu Yingcai and Zhang Shanhe, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special District Court presided over a continued trial in the First Criminal Court yesterday morning. The Police Department lawyer charged Liu with possessing opium and Zhang with the crime of covering up the transportation of opium in his official capacity. Upon questioning, Liu admitted to asking Zhang to purchase it, but Zhang stubbornly denied it. The court verified the confessions, declared the debate closed, and scheduled a date for sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Customs Utilizes Extremely Low Water Levels to Successfully Destroy the Kongling Shoal in Yichang

Difficult Rocks Exposed by the Low Water Enable a Successful Operation; The Entire Project Can Be Completed During the Low Water Season; Customs Sincerely Appeals to Shipping Merchants for Cooperation

The Yichang to Chongqing shipping route in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River requires passage through the Kongling Shoal. Even the slightest carelessness can easily lead to grounding and accidents. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with Customs, the Customs authorities are taking advantage of the exceptionally low river levels to make smooth progress in destroying the shoal, and success is imminent, which is good news for the shipping industry. The details are recorded as follows:

Kongling Shoal Rocks

The Kongling Shoal South Channel, located about 30 nautical miles upstream of Yichang in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, features jagged rocks that pose a significant hazard to navigation. Even the slightest carelessness by ships traveling between Yichang and Chongqing can lead to grounding and accidents. Despite repeated blasting operations by Customs, success has remained elusive due to the water concealing the rocks.

Successful Destruction

Recently, the Yangtze River has experienced unusually low water levels not seen in years. The water volume in the Yichang section is especially low, and the shoal has largely emerged from the water. Therefore, Customs has been able to seize this opportunity to carry out blasting operations, achieving remarkable success. According to the reporter's inquiries with Customs, the entire shoal demolition project can be completed during this low-water period.

Sincere Announcement

As the shoal demolition project nears completion, Customs is also seeking the cooperation of vessels traveling in the area to ensure its early completion. A special announcement has been issued: Regarding the announcement, the Kongling Shoal South Channel demolition project is currently underway. With the current exceptionally low river levels, success is within reach. However, the cooperation of all navigators is especially important. Therefore, all ships traveling upstream and downstream must exercise extreme caution when passing through the Kongling Shoal. Prioritize the safety of the vessel and proceed at the lowest possible speed to avoid hindering the project. This is a sincere announcement.

Zhang Dexing, a 36-year-old man from Jinhua, and his wife, Wang (28 years old), lived in a loft at No. 1, Lane 277, Chezhan Road in the Nanshi district. Yesterday morning, after Zhang Dexing went out, Wang lit a coal briquette stove in the room to keep warm. After lunch, she closed the door tightly and napped with her son (named Gendi, one year old), resulting in both mother and child suffering from coal gas poisoning. When her husband returned home at about 5 p.m., he knocked on the door but received no response. He managed to pry the door open and found that his son Gendi had already died and could not be saved.

### Robbers Raid Village Boat; Boat Woman Drowns

Recently, a case of robbers sinking a boat and drowning a boat owner in the Yangsi Port near Sanlintang, Pudong, occurred. A rural boat was docked in the port, and the boat owner was a middle-aged woman who had saved some private funds. The robbers learned of her wealth. On a dark night, they found out that the woman was sleeping alone on the boat guarding it. About six or seven of them gathered, swarmed onto the boat, woke the woman, and threatened her with guns, forcing her to hand over the hidden banknotes. The woman, startled from her sleep, pretended to be extremely poor. The robbers searched everywhere but could not find anything. They searched her body as well, but did not find a single coin. Greatly disappointed, the robbers suspected she was lying. They tied her tightly to the bottom of the cabin, preventing her from moving. Then, they broke a large hole in the bottom of the boat. Port water poured in through the hole, and the boat gradually sank. The woman cried for help but received no response. Before long, she tragically drowned. Seeing that they had vented their anger, the robbers went ashore and fled. The incident occurred at the border between the Shangnan and Liangxian counties, about thirty miles from Shanghai. It was heard that the next morning, the villagers discovered the incident and reported it to the supervisory officials for investigation. In order to understand the robbers' motives, they thoroughly searched the boat and the body. Indeed, a sum of banknotes was found in the lining of the deceased's cotton-padded coat. Apparently, the robbers had not noticed this, otherwise, the woman would not have sacrificed her life.

### Egyptian Magician Arrives in Shanghai

The Shanghai Times reports that an Egyptian mentalist, named Hamed Bey, recently arrived in the city. The other day, he performed his magic for the first time in front of a representative of the Shanghai Times at the International Hotel. First, he asked the representative to tear three pieces of paper from a notepad, write a question on each, fold them four times, crumple them in his palm, and then place them on the table. Then, the magician wrote symbols on them. After a few minutes, he said that he could explain the questions written on each paper. He then asked the representative to report the numbers written on the papers, as they had been marked with numbers in advance. The representative reported a number, and the magician immediately recited the words, which matched what was written. But this was just the first step. He then asked the representative to hold a folded piece of paper and a pen firmly in his right hand. The magician pressed his left-hand fingers firmly on the back of the representative's fist and wrote symbols on it with his right hand. After a few seconds, he told the representative to open his hand and look at the paper. Answers to the questions were written on it. Throughout the performance, the guard did not touch the papers at all. It is said that the words were written by an automatic spirit.

### Shanghai Gentry Mu Shuzai Passed Away Yesterday

High Blood Pressure Suddenly Led to Cerebral Hemorrhage; Encoffining Today, Cremation in Two Days

Mu Shuzai (also known as Shuzai), a former Chief of the Songhu Police Department, Chairman of the Shangnan Transportation Company, Chairman of the South Shanghai Fire Brigade, and currently a standing committee member of the Shanghai South District Fire Joint Association, Head of the Nanshi Defense Corps, and founder of the Jide and Hengda Cotton Mills, passed away yesterday at his residence, the Shuzai Lane, which he had built himself outside Xiaoximen, Huangjiaque Road, Nanshi.

Later, he was sent to Binlong Hospital on Baker Road, but despite the doctors' best efforts, he passed away in the hospital at half-past noon yesterday due to old age and physical weakness.

### Lawyer Xu Yi Sues Cheng Linsheng's Wife for False Accusation

Endless Litigation Between Relatives; Excessive Legal Fees of Twenty Thousand

Lawyer Xu Yi, who was convicted and removed from his position due to accusations by Cheng Li Tianzhi, the wife of real estate tycoon Cheng Linsheng, and her brother Li Quanyuan, sued Cheng Li Tianzhi for some of the charges against Xu Yi in the 24th year of the Republic. The local court sentenced him to four months, but the Jiangsu High Court overturned the verdict. Therefore, Xu Yi is now privately prosecuting Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Quanyuan in the local court for false accusations.

The Complaint States: Cheng Li Tianzhi, with her brother Li Quanyuan as guarantor, hired the plaintiff as a legal advisor for nearly two years. When the plaintiff sent a written reminder for payment of legal fees, Cheng Li Tianzhi not only denied owing money but also, in collusion with Li Quanyuan, falsely accused him of crimes such as forgery to the court last year and secretly bribed lawyer Yang Shaopeng to Judge Tan Zhuohong, who was presiding over the case, to first detain the plaintiff on abuse of power and then wrongly sentenced him. Only after an appeal was the verdict overturned and the case settled. Therefore, he requests punishment and seeks compensation for losses, such as damages to his reputation, health, and business, as well as litigation expenses, totaling over thirty thousand yuan. After the court notified the defendants, they hired lawyer Li Lin to respond, stating that the public prosecution of Xu Yi's case was initiated by Prosecutor Li Fen, who believed that there were indeed criminal suspects based on the accusations and the results of the investigation. If the accusations and the results of the investigation were extremely inconsistent, then Prosecutor Li would have filed a public prosecution for false accusation, as stipulated by the Criminal Procedure Law. The fact that the plaintiff was sentenced to four months imprisonment in this case, and the High Court overturned the verdict, only means that the legal opinions of the prosecutor and judge in the first instance differed. They believed that the evidence of the crime was insufficient. The plaintiff did not present any active counter-evidence, so the charge of false accusation cannot stand. This is supported by a precedent from the Supreme Court from the 20th year of the Republic, No. 307. As for Yang Shaopeng and Tan Zhuohong, they are even more falsely accused. This is evidenced by the non-prosecution order issued by the First Special District Court in response to the plaintiff's accusation of bribery against Li Quanyuan. Yesterday, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court and first questioned Cheng Ji Tianzhi, 52 years old, registered in She County, Anhui, residing at No. 296 Saporse Road. He then questioned Li Quanyuan, 47 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 120 Guizhou Road. He then questioned Xu Yi, 31 years old, former lawyer, from Zhongshan, Guangdong, residing at No. 13, Lane 171, Tangshan Road. The judge asked Xu Yi, "Who are you accusing?" Xu Yi replied, "Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Quanyuan, for jointly making false accusations, because

they are relatives harboring resentment." The plaintiff had been owed legal fees for two years, so he sent a letter urging payment. Unexpectedly, the two defendants falsely accused him in court, resulting in a four-month sentence, which was overturned by the High Court. He requests that the two defendants be punished for their crimes. As for the bribery case reported to the Special District Court, it was not accepted due to an error in jurisdiction. He requests that it be consolidated for trial. At this point, Cheng Li Tianzhi testified that when the High Court was hearing the case on November 11th of the 24th year of the Republic, she voluntarily abandoned the legal fees, claiming that two thousand taels of silver were enough, which proves that he forged documents. At this point, Li Quanyuan testified that he did not falsely accuse him. Besides, he is my nephew-in-law, and his wife's mother is my sister, the sister of Li Tianzhi. According to the lawyer's regulations, how could the legal fees

amount to two thousand taels? I am the manager of the Gentai Factory, and he also helped in the factory. He had many opportunities to steal the Gentai seal. Recently, he was in the First Special District Court for eight months and was released not long ago, also for matters related to Gentai. At this point, Xu Yi stated that there was a reason for abandoning the two thousand taels in legal fees. Chief Judge Luo argued that Cheng Li Tianzhi's husband was already bankrupt, and I had lent them seventy thousand taels. If it is said that two thousand taels is too much, there is a reason for this. Her husband lost tens of millions of assets. During the previous case she filed against me, they spent over ten thousand taels, and Yang Shaopeng spent more than four thousand taels in court fees. The court hearing was adjourned for further questioning at another date.

### The First Special District Local Court Burns Confiscated Drugs

Yesterday Was the Twenty-Seventh Time

The Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, in accordance with regulations, burns all opium and various drugs confiscated in drug cases every three months. Yesterday was the twenty-seventh scheduled burning. Recently, the Public Concession Police have been particularly diligent in handling drug cases, so the amount of confiscated drugs was more than in previous sessions. Therefore, President Guo requested permission from the Chief Judge to use the South Shouyi Tomb as the drug burning site and invited representatives from various agencies to supervise the process. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., representatives from the Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor of the High Court Second Branch, Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the Legal Department of the Public Works Department, and representatives from the Songhu Garrison Command all attended. President Guo ordered Gao Gongshou, the director of the treasury of seized goods, to present each item of drugs to be burned for inspection before throwing them into the fire. The process concluded at 4 p.m. The drugs destroyed yesterday included: 97 taels and 166 grams of opium, 38 small cans, 46 small boxes, 15 small packets of opium residue, 2 and a half vats of opium paste, 30 taels and 24 small cans, 6 small boxes, and 1 item; 26 pounds and 125 taels of red pills, 3,190 Hancao pills, 6 pounds of raw material and 2 taels of pill residue, half a can of pill ash, and a small packet; half a can, two small basins of red pill paste, 2 packets of white powder, 4 taels and 9999 of opium bubbles, 31 small opium bubbles, 8 packets and one small packet of opium ashes; 14 and a half pounds and 22 taels, 3 packets, 6 small packets, 3 cans, 7 and a half cans, 2 and a half small vats, and one bowl, a small jar, a bull vat, and 35 items; 6 taels of opium pills; a small packet of opium residue, 2 small vats and four items; one pound and 316 taels of morphine, and 59 small packets; one and a half taels and 34 grams of heroin, 1329 small packets, two small cans, and 13 items; three small packets of coffee essence; and over 2502 pieces of opium paraphernalia.

### Three Robbers Break In, Victim Stabbed Five Times After Finding Nothing

Zhu Shanchao, a resident of a grass hut in Tianxinanshou, Bingchang Road, Pudong, Taizhou, made a living by raising pigs. Recently, he sold two piglets and earned 9,000 yuan, which was discovered by robbers. At around midnight the night before last, a group of three men with a Jiangbei accent, wearing short-sleeved and short trousers and blackening their faces with ash, aged about twenty or thirty, broke into the house while Zhu's family was asleep, intending to rob them. Zhu and his family were awakened from their sleep. The robbers demanded that he hand over the money from the pigs, but Zhu claimed that it had already been spent. The robbers searched but found nothing, and in anger, they took out a seven-inch-long sharp knife and stabbed Zhu five times in the arms and thighs. They then grabbed more than ten pieces of single-layer clothing and fled. Fortunately, Zhu's injuries were not serious, and he bandaged himself without going to the hospital. At dawn, Zhu's wife, Yu, reported the incident to the Pudong Police Station and requested an investigation. Director Zhang, believing that the robbers' blackened faces indicated that they were familiar with the victim, ordered the detective team to investigate.

### Shen A'wu, 34, Addicted to Heroin for Twelve Years

Shen A'wu, 34 years old, a local resident living at No. 28, Sanpailou in the city, bought three small packets of heroin from a Korean man at Huile Lane on Fuzhou Road for two jiao on the afternoon of the 17th of this month due to a drug addiction. While returning home, he was found to be suspicious by officer No. 82 of the French Concession Police and two Russian officers, Nos. 27 and 23, on Dongzilaihuo Street in the French Concession. They found the drugs on his person, took him to the police station, and sent him to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After investigation by Judge Peng Huan, he was sentenced yesterday to twelve years imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for ten years for using heroin. He will be detained in the detention center during the appeal period.

### Sixteen-Year-Old Child Unfit to Be a University Teacher

A Lawsuit in the Education Sector Between Xu Mushi and Fan Rencai

Xu Mushi, a native of Yuyao, graduated from St. Francis College in the summer of the 19th year of the Republic. He then founded the Mushi English Night School in the Yiyuan, which offered high school level and junior high school classes and had a large enrollment. Opposite his school, in a lane on Fuyou Road, was the Wushi Commercial English Night School, run by Fan Rencai. Xu Mushi had been a teacher there in August of the 19th year of the Republic. Fan Rencai printed in the school's enrollment brochure that Xu Mushi was a student of the school and, after being strictly managed by the school, was able to serve as the principal of the Mushi Night School. Xu Mushi was very angry. He argued that the Wushi Night School, which had previously used aviation lottery tickets, offered a scholarship with a grand prize to anyone who introduced a student, but failed to attract enrollments. They then listed him as a student in order to mislead outsiders into believing in his knowledge and to transfer to their school, which was despicable. He requested that the Social Affairs Bureau investigate the matter. Yu Jianmin was sent to investigate, and Fan Rencai presented Xu Mushi's registration application, which mentioned Wang Yongfang as the school's typing director and teacher, and Xu Mushi's teacher, etc. Xu argued that Wang Yongfang was only 22 years old this year and only 16 years old in the 19th year of the Republic. How could a child be a university graduate and teacher? Moreover, Wang was still a student at the Yimiao Commercial Yiwu School in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic, while he himself had graduated from Zhenhua Typing School as early as the 17th year of the Republic. St. Francis also had a typing course, so why would he go to Wushi to study? Moreover, in August of the 19th year of the Republic, he and all the teachers and staff of Fan Rencai's school took a photo together, which of course meant that some were staff and some were teachers. There were definitely no students being referred to as teachers. The registration form and application were clearly forged. He filed a private lawsuit against Fan Rencai in the local court for defamation and forgery. Due to procedural errors, the court ruled that it could not be accepted. Therefore, Xu Mushi appealed the defamation part to the Jiangsu High Court. For the remaining parts, he reported to the prosecutor, and Prosecutor Wang summoned both parties for investigation. He argued that he would issue a subpoena to continue taking evidence. Yesterday, he received a subpoena again. The prosecutor argued that because the case file had been taken away by the High Court, the investigation could not begin. He should wait for the High Court's appeal decision before further review.

### The Chinese Benevolent and Orphan Association Held Its Eighth Annual Meeting Yesterday

President Kong Xiangxi Personally Presided, Passing the Work Outline for the 26th Year

The Chinese Benevolent and Orphan Association held its eighth annual meeting yesterday (the 30th) at 3 PM in the Zhongshan Hall of the YMCA on Museum Road. In addition to re-electing executive committee members and reporting on association affairs, three temporary proposals were passed. Details are listed below:

Attendees: Yesterday’s attendees included members and guests such as Kong Xiangxi, Wu Zhencheng, (Li Ting’an representing), Pan Gongzhan, (Zhang Binghui representing), Yu Yiting, Xue Wanqiang, Lin Kanghou, Mao Yun, Qu Wenliu, Liu Ruiheng, Zhao Jinqing, Xu Jianping, Chen Zhensheng, and over fifty others, presided over by President Kong Xiangxi.

Chairman's Report: After the customary formalities, President Kong delivered a speech, saying, “Gentlemen, ladies, today is the day we hold the eighth annual meeting of this association. We all feel very happy and invigorated. With so many distinguished guests present, the president and colleagues of this association feel even more fortunate and grateful. This association was established in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China. It has been nearly nine years. In the past nine years, although the funds and staff of this association have been limited, my colleagues have worked diligently and made gradual progress, never daring to slacken. In the past, we have also received assistance from many sympathetic people in society who have provided support in various ways with their spirit, time, and money. This association has been able to show a small degree of achievement in its work. To list some of the more significant achievements, we have promoted Children's Day and held benevolent and orphan sports meetings, held national benevolent and orphan conferences, encouraged the establishment of benevolent and orphan associations in various regions, helped emerging benevolent and orphan causes, built the Nanjing Benevolent and Orphan Experimental Zone, initiated the Shanghai Benevolent and Orphan Group Mutual Aid Committee, sent personnel to investigate benevolent and orphan causes abroad, participated in international family education conferences and the Far Eastern Conference on the Prohibition of Trafficking in Women and Children, published the Modern Parents Monthly, published publications on benevolent and orphan issues, held lectures on benevolent and orphan issues, conducted children's research work, operated benevolent and orphan nurseries, benevolent and orphan training centers, benevolent and orphan elementary schools, benevolent and orphan clinics, benevolent and orphan tuberculosis sanatoriums, held children's health campaigns and children's health competitions, handled cases of child abuse, protected homeless children, promoted children's laws and children's courts, and provided relief to disaster-stricken children in various regions. However, when it comes to these small achievements, we must give credit to the cooperation and efforts of the benevolent and orphan comrades in general. I hope that everyone can continue to cooperate so that the future of our Republic of China can have a more solid foundation. Everyone, recalling last year in the first month, when this association held its seventh annual meeting, I said that we are conducting the cause of benevolence and orphans not merely as a charitable undertaking, but as a social and national salvation undertaking. Charitable undertakings are naturally commendable, but they are ultimately passive rather than active. As for the undertakings of this association, although a small part is passive, such as providing relief to disaster-stricken children in various regions and rescuing abused child laborers and maids, most of the undertakings are active. For example, promoting Children's Day, holding national benevolent and orphan conferences, encouraging the establishment of benevolent and orphan associations in various regions, publishing the Modern Parents Monthly, publishing parenting studies and parenting education wall charts, holding lectures on benevolent and orphan issues, conducting children's research work, promoting parenting education, holding children's health campaigns, and advocating the use of the latest scientific methods to educate children throughout the country, this association hopes not only to enable children throughout the country to be free from hardship and abuse, but also to enable children throughout the country to have healthy bodies and healthy minds so that they can create a healthy Republic of China. In this way, the undertakings of this association are naturally a far-reaching undertaking of national salvation, not just a passive charitable undertaking. Promoting children's happiness is naturally our direct goal, but our ultimate goal is to promote the happiness of the Chinese nation and to complete the construction of the Republic of China by promoting children's happiness. This point is very important, and I would like to emphasize it again at this annual meeting and solemnly state it to everyone. I think everyone will be able to sympathize with and approve of this. Everyone, when we discuss the cause of benevolence and orphans today, we cannot help but think of the general situation of our country. Our China has the largest population in the world and occupies a very large area. According to the statistics of the Shen Bao Yearbook Society, our country's population is 421,307,785. Our country's area totals 11,173,558 square kilometers, accounting for about one-quarter of Asia and one-fifteenth of the world's land area, making it the largest country in Asia and the third largest country in the world. With such a large population and such a large area, why is our country still so weak and often subjected to imperialist aggression, unable to stand on an equal footing with other countries? The only reason is that our nation has not had much contact with foreign races, lacking observation, stimulation, and competition. Therefore, virtues such as unity, solidarity, hard work, struggle, worship of leaders, and promotion of martial prowess are not well developed in our country. Material civilization has no foundation, and national defense construction is even more out of the question. When the doors were opened and we encountered organized foreign aggression, we were at a loss and could not avoid the result of failure. Now, to consolidate our foundation, we should naturally work hard to cultivate healthy citizens. To thoroughly achieve our goal of national salvation, we must work hard to cultivate healthy children. Only with healthy children can we have healthy citizens, and only then can we have a healthy country. The cause of benevolence and orphans has such a significant relationship to the future of our country. From this, we can get a general idea. In the era of the Warring States, King Goujian of Yue was defeated by King Fucha of Wu. He used ten years of replenishment and ten years of training to finally defeat Fucha and avenge the great humiliation for the country. When we study European history, we can also find the same fact. In the 19th century, when Germany achieved victory over France through hard work and held a triumphant celebration, General Moltke said in his speech, "The crown of this victory should be placed on the heads of elementary school teachers." This is truly worth our attention. France was defeated by Germany and suffered great humiliation. The French people then resolved to avenge themselves. On the walls of elementary schools everywhere, they used vermilion ink to draw pictures of German aggression against France to cultivate the psychology of revenge in children. As a result, fifty years later, the World War broke out, and they defeated Germany, signed a treaty in the Palace of Versailles, and forced Germany to submit, washing away the shame of the Franco-Prussian War. We can know that everything depends on human effort. As long as we can now earnestly carry out the cause of benevolence and orphans and pay attention to the work of replenishment and training, the future of our China is still very bright. Promoting national prestige, perhaps in ten or twenty years, future history will tell us. Today is the day we hold the eighth annual meeting of this association. As president, I would like to present the importance of the cause of benevolence and orphans to encourage everyone together, hoping that there will be even greater development in the future. However, the knowledge and abilities of the colleagues of this association are limited. I am willing to receive criticism and guidance from all benevolent and orphan comrades and ask everyone present today not to hesitate to give us your corrections. That is what we are looking forward to very much. (To be continued)

### Over a Thousand Road Workers in the Public Concession Went on Strike Yesterday Morning to Protest Dismissals by Lottery

Organized Petition Delegation to Appeal to the Ratepayers' Association, etc. Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing Agreed to Mediate

Da Gong She reported that after the Public Concession's Bureau of Works announced its plan to reduce road workers, all 1,200 road workers were panicked. They appealed to various parties but received no results. The Public Concession's Bureau of Works insisted on the established plan, convening all road workers at the Bureau of Works at 9 AM yesterday to draw lots to dismiss nine-tenths of them and planned to take back all road worker badges. The workers strongly protested and declared a joint strike starting at 7 AM, refusing to draw lots. As a result, all road construction work in the Public Concession was halted yesterday. The workers maintained order after the strike, and there were no disturbances.

Yu Qiaqing Agreed to Mediate: After all the road workers went on strike, each district selected 70 representatives to form a petition delegation. The petition delegation selected Li Jingchun, Liu Huanwen, Huan Buying, Cai Furong, Wang Shuangcai, and five others as full representatives. At around 1 PM, they set off with their petition, first going to the Citizen's Federation of the First Special District, where they were received by Chen Jiufeng. After inquiring about the situation, he accompanied them to He DeKui of the Bureau of Works, where they were received by He. He acknowledged that the workers' demands were legitimate and submitted them to the Director General for handling. They then went to the Sanbei Company to petition Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, who personally received them and agreed to go to the Bureau of Works on Monday morning to negotiate and mediate and scheduled a definite response for 5 PM. The road workers expressed satisfaction and left. They then went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to petition, where they were received by Secretary Yan E'sheng, who agreed to report to the chairman and protest to the Bureau of Works. They dispersed at around 3 PM.

To Petition the Party and Government Tomorrow: The Mutual Aid Association of Road Construction Workers believes that if the dismissal order is not rescinded, the livelihood of over a thousand workers will be in dire straits. To request that party and government agencies formally negotiate with the Bureau of Works, the association will send representatives tomorrow (Monday) at 10 AM to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government in separate groups, asking for assistance to maintain their livelihoods.

Listing Reasons to Request Negotiation: The petitioning road workers submitted a document yesterday to the Director General of the Bureau of Works, the Chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Chinese Directors, requesting them to uphold justice and provide assistance. The original text reads: "Respectfully submitted: We, the road construction workers of the Public Concession, work like oxen and horses all day long, barely eking out a living with our sweat and blood. The hardship of our lives is truly unbearable. Now, the Bureau of Works, under the pretext of reducing government spending, is excluding Chinese workers and ordering the dismissal of all 1,200 road construction laborers by the end of this month. We, the ox-horse workers, are suddenly faced with the hardship of unemployment, and no less than 10,000 old and young who rely on us, directly and indirectly, will become hungry ghosts. Everyone is in a state of panic. Previously, all the road workers gathered to discuss and organize a mutual aid association, requesting the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of justice, and sent a letter to the Bureau of Works asking them to consider the difficult times and rescind the order. However, the Bureau of Works has not responded, and the deadline has arrived. We have no choice but to submit this petition to the Director General and the Directors, requesting you to thoroughly investigate and forward it to the Bureau of Works for reconsideration. For the issue of reducing government spending, please find other appropriate methods and rescind the dismissal order for Chinese workers. We respectfully list the reasons and facts below and request your inspection: ① The only reason for the Bureau of Works to dismiss Chinese workers is to reduce expenditures. In reality, the salaries of the 1,000-plus road construction workers are less than the bonuses of ten senior foreign staff members of the Bureau of Works. If the intention is truly to reduce expenditures, then the high salaries of senior foreign staff members should be reduced. To lay off over a thousand workers and increase social instability is not the right way. If this plan to dismiss Chinese workers succeeds, will there be no need to build or repair roads in the future? If so, then the entire Bureau of Works will no longer be necessary. Is this reasonable? ② In terms of road administration, the road lines are gradually extending, and the road surfaces are gradually widening. Due to the increase in vehicles, road maintenance work will inevitably be more complicated. It seems that the number of road construction workers should be increased. Why is there a dismissal? ③ We, the road construction workers, have served the Bureau of Works for over ten years. During the January 28th Incident, the work was intense. Workers were added and recruited, but no one came. All defensive works needed to be urgently arranged. We, the hired workers, could not retreat. Despite the great danger, we had to brave the gunfire and work day and night. Everyone requested an increase in wages. We, the road construction workers, have made contributions in the past and should be given a raise and a reward. Now, everyone is silent and keeps to themselves. Doing good deeds but receiving bad rewards is against reason and human nature and should not be allowed. ④ We have learned that the Bureau of Works plans to dismiss workers in order to reduce expenditures but intends to recruit workers temporarily. (Omission) This is actually a selfish proposal under the guise of reducing expenditures, using flowery words to deceive superiors. How could the Bureau of Works not see through this and be deceived? We, the Chinese workers who rely on sweat and blood to make a living, will all be put to death. In summary, the Bureau's policy of reducing spending and dismissing workers will not only fail to reduce expenditures but may actually increase them. Why bother with this unnecessary action that kills people and saves others? We hereby submit this petition in anguish, requesting you to have pity on the laborers, save the masses, avoid creating complications that hinder traffic, and bring peace to society. This would truly be a meritorious act."

It was resolved: Amended and passed.

### Those Who Impersonated Officials to Commit Fraud Convicted

Ling Changsheng and Wang Qigui Each Sentenced to One Year and Two Months

Chen Xize, a Tianjin native residing at 52 Caishi Street in the French Concession, had previously escaped from Dalian due to a drug trafficking case. Upon returning to Shanghai at the end of last year, Sun, who used to be a guarantor at the residence of a certain celebrity, learned of this. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, he colluded with Ancha No. 681 of the French Concession Police, Constable Wang Qigui, and former Constable Ling Changsheng No. 155, to impersonate detectives and go to Chen's home under the pretext of investigating drugs. Chen happened to be out, and Chen's wife was lying on the bed. She was arrested. The landlord, surnamed Wang, tried to settle the matter with 100 yuan, paying 20 yuan first, with the balance to be paid the next day. When Ling and Wang went to collect the money, Chen reported them to the French Concession Police, who arrested Ling and Wang and handed them over to the Special Court for prosecution. The details of this case have been reported in this newspaper. Now, after the interrogation by Judge Sun Penghai, the judgment was made yesterday afternoon: Ling Changsheng and Wang Qigui are jointly convicted of the crime of intimidation and fraud and are each sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment. The remaining charges are acquitted. During the appeal period, they will be transferred to the detention center.

### Tongyi Creditors' Group Urges Advance Payment

After the Shanghai Tongyi Trust Company went bankrupt, various creditors formed creditors' groups and filed lawsuits against the directors, supervisors, and directly responsible persons. Among them, the creditors' group organized by a group of Christian friends and women had the highest amount of claims and the largest number of members. The group hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Zhang Yifan, and Chen Changsheng, as well as accountant Ma Qichang, to sue all the directors and supervisors of the company for violating the Company Law and the Savings Bank Law. The Criminal Division of the Shanghai First Special District Court sentenced them to fines. Appeals to the Second Branch of the High Court were all rejected. All cases have now been finalized. The related civil lawsuit for over 250,000 yuan has been transferred to the Civil Division. The creditors' group believes that with the Lunar New Year approaching, the funds have not been received for a long time, and further research is needed on the coordination plan in the company's restructuring plan. Representatives and others held a meeting at the Dengshuo Mo Hotel yesterday afternoon, together with lawyers Zhang Yifan and Chen Changsheng and accountant Ma Qichang, to decide on the following points: ① Request the bankruptcy administrator to make an advance payment of 20% of all the company's current funds. ② Urge the bankruptcy administrator to actively pursue litigation against the savings and banking departments that have not yet been sued, as the directors and supervisors of the company were at fault. All banking departments and deposited government bonds should also be jointly and severally liable in accordance with the law, fully compensating the savings departments. ③ Before the supervisors take office, please allow the Shanghai First Special District Court to temporarily act as the supervisors and promptly sell off the company's movable property within the scope of the full rights and interests of the creditors in order to accumulate more current funds. ④ Request the court to seek effective remedial measures for the four aborted creditors' meetings. ⑤ In principle, agree to the coordinator's plan for Tongyi's restructuring, but the percentage of current funds to be returned differs too much. The lawyers and accountants should be requested to argue on the basis of reason, otherwise it cannot be accepted.

### The Reputation of Famous Calligrapher and Painter Yang Weiquan

The modern famous writer Yang Weiquan has been studying calligraphy and painting for more than 30 years. He has a very deep understanding of the works of famous people in the Song and Yuan dynasties. He has also traveled to famous scenic spots everywhere, taking materials on the spot. He has seen a lot, and his mind is naturally rich. What he has seen is reflected in his pen. Every stroke is a wonderful idea. And his works such as "Ashes Heap" and "Old Word Basket" contain a myriad of images in one furnace, and each presents its own unique charm, which is comparable to the famous "Ashes Heap" of Qian Shunju in the Song Dynasty. People have long heard of his name overseas. A few years ago, one of Yang's masterpieces flowed into Taiwan, and a Japanese bought it for 1,200 gold. Last winter, Wang Zhengting asked him to paint four paintings as gifts to the American President Roosevelt. Roosevelt regarded them as treasures and they are now displayed in the National Museum of that country. Those who have seen them all praised them. Now there are imitators who often mix in counterfeit goods. Isn't this because the genuine article is so rare that people want to mix in counterfeits? Although there is a current price list, he never easily creates a work. He generally only makes one fan a day or one painting in half a month. Those in the world who want to obtain his paintings can contact 142 Huajinpailou in the city.

### Asia Company Establishes Wireless Electricity Maintenance Practice Class

Since the enrollment of the third class of radio repair personnel practice class attached to the Asia Company at 88 Nanjing Road in this city, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic. The company has set up the company in view of the sharp increase in the number of radios sold in various places and to meet the needs of repair talents.

### Temple Bells

— Shen Jiaqian

The overnight new snow settled quietly on the plum branches like velvet balls. A thin layer of ice formed on the stream, and occasionally a bubble floated up from the heart of the river, perhaps a huge-scaled fish wanting to peek out and search for food. But the fisherman in his raincoat still slept soundly in his thatched hut; he had drunk too much wine last night.

The empty mountain was so still. The bells from the temple on the mountain peak had stopped ringing for quite some time. The young monks were used to laziness. As soon as their master went down the mountain, they would boldly go down to drink a string of five hundred cash worth of white liquor and even buy half a pig's head to enrich their stomachs filled with vegetables and sweet potatoes. They did not understand the profound meaning of the scriptures, nor did they know from when they had to kneel on the futon and do such arduous work. The Tathagata was so solemn; his eyes seemed like two electric torches that could illuminate people's hearts and lungs. Looking at their master, however, he was sincerely focused on his nose with his eyes and on his heart with his nose, almost like a living bodhisattva. The incense in the large incense burner swirled around the plaque in the Hall of Great Strength, and a flower bloomed on the wick of the ever-burning lamp. Then, the young monks subconsciously struck the Great Compassion Bell hanging on the beam, letting the clear sound of the bell echo in the valley, harmonizing with their murmured recitations.

Time had destroyed the wind chimes on the eaves, and the ancient temple had declined from its prosperous days to a state of dwindling incense. Standing outside the mountain gate, gazing at the white clouds near the horizon, the village seemed to be as still as death at their feet. If not for the barking of wild dogs, this place would truly be close to the path to heaven. The young monks and the temple grew up together. They had learned more scriptures. In the evening, after finishing their evening lessons in the main hall, they silently followed behind their master, letting the candlesticks in their hands cast terrifying shadows on the corridor as they slowly walked towards the abbot's room.

The master never seemed to tire. He sat in the armchair covered with a tiger skin, solemnly and spiritedly telling stories of attaining enlightenment, asking them to be sincere and not to have wandering thoughts, and to take refuge in the Buddha Tathagata—the golden statue sitting on the lotus petals in the Hall of Great Strength, with eyes that could see into people's hearts and lungs. The young monks were temporarily stunned; their souls seemed to hover outside the gates of heaven, and at the same time, they felt a bright and dazzling golden light emanating from their heads, which could illuminate the movements of the lower world. The division between the two worlds awakened them from their fantasies. The master had already sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and rested his mind; his straw sandals were pushed aside the armchair, and the night was deep.

Watching the swallows build nests under the eaves, now it was the snowy winter again. The brothers occasionally talked about the day they entered the temple, which they could no longer remember; they had almost grown up in this ancient temple and would die in this ancient temple, like their grandmaster, covered with two vats and buried in the bamboo forest behind the mountain, which was called nirvana—but they could not see heaven!

The sun climbed over the mountain peak, lazily shining on the red screen wall with the four characters "Amitabha Buddha." The ice in the stream had melted, and the plum branches seemed even thinner. It was late; tomorrow would probably be a sunny day.

Suddenly, the sound of a wooden fish came from the mountain path. A traveling monk was walking towards the mountain peak. It was their master. He looked devoutly at the ground, perhaps chanting the Buddha's name. A Shen card was tied to his back, and a thin stick of incense was burning perpetually. The mountain path was like the path of life, rugged and winding. The new snow had melted into water, and water had seeped into his straw sandals, making walking even more difficult. But the old monk was not lazy at all, taking step by step, bowing deeply to the muddy road while chanting the Buddha's name. His steadfast faith would be maintained until his death.

The bells were echoing in the valley again, and the evening lessons in the incense-filled hall had begun again.

### The Clock

— Shen Bing

The clock endures years of solitude, playing with musical beats. The sounds of the clock are so uneven, yet so even and pure.

The languid face of the clock is so pale, staring straight at people with idle eyes. People tired of working look up, and it fulfills its duty as if to say what time it is now; but it will never say whether the days pass so quickly or so slowly.

Although the diligent pendulum is locked in a closed room, it has a transparent window. Through this window, it can see the busy people. It is happy, always swaying back and forth. Occasionally, it steals a moment of rest, its body drooping helplessly, due to the owner's negligence in winding it up. The pendulum does not complain, nor is it greedy for the comfort of its companions. It endures years of solitude.

The gears imprisoned in the dark dungeon only emit slight groans, although their work is the most arduous. They do not even have a transparent window; they do not know the time and are always working tirelessly. They are content and do not harbor resentment, because their groans are slight.

The sounds of the clock are so uneven, but also so even and pure. The clock is a harmonious person.

### Deserted Village

— Guan Yinxi

The weather had almost completely turned dark, and the rain fell incessantly and sadly.

The surrounding area was strangely chaotic and hazy. From the far, desolate village, there was no longer the occasional scent of rice and the frantic barking of village dogs. Those villages, once prosperous, were now withered and empty. Entire groups of young people abandoned their homes, wives, and daughters, fleeing to the forests and farther places for hunger and survival. The helpless, weak children and women either died, were sold off by merchants, or wandered into the cities. In the abandoned villages, there was no human voice or smoke from cooking fires. All that remained were some lost wild dogs, dragging their red tongues, drooping their tails, four thin legs supporting a shriveled belly, noses stretched out long, running around everywhere, sniffing. They lived by chewing on the corpses and bones of people. Slowly, the bones and corpses were all gone, and they began to kill each other, eating the corpses and bones of their own kind. When the corpses and bones of their own kind were also gnawed clean, they waited for death or fled to even farther places.

And so, for a long time in this disaster area, we could no longer hear the barking of dogs or the cries of people.

Along that stone-paved slope, I walked slowly, calculating the remaining unfinished journey in my mind. I felt that everything I was wearing and carrying was soaked through, and the cold struck me, making me shiver from time to time.

As I slowly climbed to the top of a not-very-high ridge, a dilapidated roadside pavilion stood abruptly before me. On it hung a plaque with faded paint. Looking at it in the dim light, I knew it was inscribed with the three characters "Seven Mile Pavilion." My destination was Luoyang, which was still about ten miles away from here. Looking at this weather, it was impossible to travel ten miles.

"I must find a place to rest, to rest..." I thought, and continued to move my feet. "Then, where to go?" I asked myself again. This is all deserted villages! "I couldn't help but feel disappointed.

After walking about a mile, the sky became even darker. I couldn't even see things ten steps away. I only felt myself gradually entering a cold section, surrounded by trees, shaking in the rain, gently swaying.

Suddenly, a strand of light seeping out from the forest caught my attention. I cried out to myself in a trembling panic:

"There is hope! People live here!" So, I lifted my trembling feet and walked towards the light.

In front of an old, lonely tile-roofed house, I stood abruptly. Raindrops pattered on the roof tiles, making clear, rustling sounds. I could also hear the sound of my own pulse beating. This sound seemed to whisper softly in my ear:

"Knock on the door and go in? Can you be sure they are good people?..."

Finally, without any hesitation, I stepped forward and gently knocked on the iron ring on the wooden door. After about five or six minutes, I heard a series of staggering footsteps coming from inside.

The door opened slightly, and a thin, old man went back inside without even looking at me, murmuring sadly to himself, as if to himself, "You have taken everything, everything is gone..."

I was very perplexed. I thought about turning around and leaving regardless, but I didn't have that much courage. This sudden event was too strange. I couldn't just leave. I needed to see everything clearly. So, I followed him into the house, staggering.

In the small room, a bean oil lamp was flickering with its dim light, filling every broken and rotten corner. A corner of the floor was covered with a lot of straw, which was used as a bed. On the pile of straw lay a sleeping girl of thirteen or fourteen years old, but when I looked closely, I noticed that her mouth and nose were covered with bloodstains, and her eyes were slightly closed, with a white tinge.

The old man sat on a low stool, holding his head in his hands, bitterly mumbling to himself.

"I said: Old gentlemen, please be kind. This child is still young, and she is the only one I have... But, you dragged her away soon after, and I followed after them. I found her in a cave, but she was already dead, naked..."

I understood everything. I understood how this child had died, and what kind of person this old man took me for. I felt it was necessary to explain to him, but as I did so, he angrily raised his hand and shouted...

"Now I, I have nothing left!" His voice was so hoarse, and tears dripped down.

### A Great Scientific Invention: A Glass Heart Can Make Dead Flesh Live

— Te

The famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh, together with Dr. Carrel, a medical expert who previously won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, have recently invented an artificial glass heart, which has opened up undreamed-of possibilities in medical research. This glass heart can keep organs cut from animals or humans completely alive, thanks to Colonel Lindbergh's wisdom in achieving mechanical perfection.

Since scientists invented the method of extracting gland secretions, only a very small amount could be extracted from living animal organs, which was very expensive. Now, with the new invention that can artificially maintain the "life" of organs, large quantities can be extracted from organs. Insulin for treating diabetes and other therapeutic materials for many other difficult diseases can now be extracted quickly and cheaply using a glass heart that is shaped like a normal coffee filter.

Heart disease and adolescence problems may be solved in the future by studying how to maintain the viability of organs in chemical test conditions. This invention is a very interesting thing in the medical world.

Colonel Lindbergh once flew a plane to deliver an anti-pneumonia serum from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York to Baker, Canada, to save the dying aviator Bennett. He first met Dr. Carrel at this time. The doctor was very famous in the medical world. He had successfully kept a chicken heart beating in a chemical test laboratory using a nourishing medium, thus gaining great fame. In 1912, he took a heart from the abdomen of a dead but not yet cold chick, cut off a part of the heart, and put it in a glass tube. To this day, that heart is still beating. But the doctor hoped to go a step further, maintaining the complete life and health of organs, thereby producing gland secretions of immeasurable value. He had partially solved this problem, but his real desire was to create a mechanical heart. So the extremely intelligent Colonel Lindbergh came to be the doctor's research assistant.

The first aviator to fly across the Atlantic secretly worked at the Rockefeller Institute for five years, and then the world knew that he had changed from an aviator to a medical researcher. But the content of his research remained unknown. He worked hard for another two years before lifting the curtain and announcing his great success. It turned out that he had solved the entire problem that Dr. Carrel had not completely solved. His "glass coffee pot" can supply blood or blood substitutes to a living organ, just like a real heart. He used a compressed "artificial air" device to provide the repulsive force of the blood flow. This device must be sealed to prevent mold from invading, because in the past, Dr. Carrel's own experiments had been killed by mold.

This artificial glass heart, day after day, week after week, the blood circulates, so that the organs it nourishes do not show any signs of weakness or decay.

Now, human organs have been tested using the same method. This amazing new invention is opening up new horizons in medical research almost every day. The medical community believes that this glass heart has unlimited uses. One American medical giant said: "I dare say that no matter how much we exaggerate its function today, within a few years, we will feel that today's predictions are too cautious and subtle."

### Guochun Opens "Get Rich Quick"

A hilarious comedy that will have you rolling in the aisles

### Literary Writers' Criticism of "Sunrise"

For me, "Sunrise" feels closer than "Thunderstorm." In terms of subject matter, the author has moved from exposing the dark side of large families to attempting to uncover the baseness and depravity of society. - "Jin Yi"

...Speaking of "Thunderstorm," I must confess that it was thanks to it that I believed that China truly had a "modern drama" that could be staged on the most beautiful stage in Paris. Before that, although I had seen the scripts of two of the most outstanding playwrights, I always felt that they could not compare to the plays I had seen abroad, and I wanted to leave halfway through. Only "Thunderstorm" truly convinced me from the bottom of my heart. ...From the script, "Sunrise" has indeed given me great satisfaction, and I hope that in the near future, it can give me even greater satisfaction from the stage!
— (Li Lieven)

..."Sunrise" can be said to be a silhouette of urban society. From here, we see how people from all walks of life live, how they live in the decadent and extravagant life, how they die in the cruel and miserable life, how they are forced to die... The author uses his enthusiasm to completely depict those vivid scenes and vivid characters for us; undoubtedly, the author's talent, like that kind of majestic momentum, that kind of skilled technique, etc., appearing on the Chinese theater scene, can simply be said to be the first time.
— (Huang Mei)

...If "Thunderstorm" is a tragedy of fate, then we would like to say that "Sunrise" is closer to a social tragedy. If we dislike that "Thunderstorm" only shows us the ruins of feudal families, then we should admit that "Sunrise" shows us a large part of a festering society.
— (Li Rui)

I read "Thunderstorm" two years ago and "Sunrise" two months ago. Both plays deal with big issues, and both are written in extremely complex, intense, and meticulous ways. Both plays deeply moved me and made me admire Mr. Cao Yu's profound conception and magnificent writing skills.
— (Li Guangtian)

### Da Guangming Screens "Turning the Universe"

Now, her new film "Can This Be Dixie?" is released today at Da Guangming. The film is co-starred by six famous actors including the lanky San Mao Zayer and two hundred beauties. There are three giant scenes in the film, which are magnificent, four famous songs, each of which is pleasant to listen to, and it is also hilarious and full of jokes. It is indeed a very interesting film and worth watching with the whole family.
