### Chiang Kai-shek's Speech on Good Friday

A Special Meeting Held in Nanjing Church; Read by Huang Renlin Yesterday on Behalf of Chiang

[Nanjing] The East Asia Joint Council of the Methodist Church in Nanjing convened a special meeting at Wesley Church on the evening of the 26th, which was Good Friday. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was invited to give a speech, which was read by Huang Renlin on his behalf. The title was "The Lessons I Learned from the Suffering of Jesus." The original feeding said: Life cannot be without religious belief, and revolutionaries cannot be without religious-like confidence in their revolutionary doctrine, otherwise, no matter how big or small the cause, nothing can be achieved. People in the world often retreat when encountering difficulties or give up halfway, all because they have no self-confidence, that is, no religious belief. I have believed in Jesus for nearly ten years, and I have been reading the scriptures and cultivating the Tao without interruption. During the Xi'an Incident last winter, when things happened suddenly, I was alone and trapped in the rebellious department for two weeks. I once asked the monitors to read the Bible, and I felt it was more cordial and meaningful. The greatness of Jesus's spirit of universal love made me raise my spirit to fight against evil forces, and finally overcome the demons of revenge and promote justice. I am also grateful to my fellow believers in the church for praying for me. The spiritual response was very helpful. In addition to thanking my fellow believers, I cannot but give glory to Jesus in front of them. I cannot describe even one ten-thousandth of Jesus's holiness. Today is the anniversary of the suffering of our Lord Jesus, so I respectfully present what I have gained in my heart to my fellow believers. Are the seven words on the cross not the last words of our Jesus? The first sentence is to pray to God for the murderers, saying, "Father, they do not know what they are doing, please forgive them." How great is Jesus's universal love! I have thought about it more than half of my life. Now, please take the facts of the Xi'an Incident as an example. Before I entered Shaanxi for the second time, I had already noticed that the troops had mixed thoughts, divergent words and deeds, and various complex and bizarre reports, even saying that there would be extraordinary conspiracies and rebellions. Those around me advised against it, and everyone wanted to stop me. From the perspective of the responsibility I bear, the foundation of national unity has been laid, and as the commander-in-chief, I dare not refuse the responsibility of teaching. Moreover, this body belongs to the party and the country, and safety cannot be considered. From the perspective of my religious belief, when our Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem for the last time, he understood that there were crises everywhere, but he still rode a donkey straight in, without any evasion. He was supremely great, brave and righteous. Why should I enter, shrink back in front, since my love for my subordinates is like loving my own sons, I will never consider other things, so I lightly loaded and reduced the number of followers, and resolutely went to Shaanxi, where the change occurred in my armpit, and I personally stepped into the danger, causing the central government to worry, the people to worry, and fellow travelers to pray earnestly, and I am deeply ashamed, and my conscience has advanced day by day, and my love has become thicker and thicker. After being hijacked, some used conditions to coerce, some used sweet words to seduce, some used weapons to intimidate, and some threatened to hand them over to the "People's Front" for public judgment. The dangers were unpredictable. However, because I firmly believe in Christ Jesus in this environment, every time I think of our Lord Jesus, who was tempted by demons in the wilderness for forty days, and his last experience of the exclusive prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, the humiliation before being interrogated in the court, and the true story of my Prime Minister's troubles in London because of praying to get teaching, all are vividly depicted, as if I am raising my spirit to make a fierce confrontation with the rebellious department, and when preparing to sacrifice myself in the spirit of being crucified when the rebellious department delivers the so-called public system, in order to live up to the expectations of my life, I feel enlightened and happy. After the incident was settled, the rebels realized that it was a reckless and destructive act that brought disaster to the country, and they were deeply afraid, but Nai followed Jesus's teaching of forgiving people seventy times seven times, giving them a chance to renew themselves, and thinking that my sincerity was not credible, so that I could not give them spiritual inspiration, and my heart was ashamed and boundless. Since I have been in charge of the school and the commander-in-chief, I have always used two words to train my subordinates. These two words are: (1) If I have any selfishness or self-interest, and do not work for the country and the people, then no matter who it is, they can regard me as a sinner of the country, that is, everyone can kill me. (2) If my words and deeds are slightly insincere, false and pretentious, and do not think about revolution and doctrine, then any subordinate can regard me as an enemy, that is, they can kill me at any time. I believe that these two words are sincere words, and they are also the result of my religious-like confidence. This is also the spirit of universal love of our Lord Jesus, and the teachings of the Prime Minister's magnanimity and benevolence, which are practical. In short, Jesus's whole life was in a period of suffering, and his spirit of perseverance, universal love, and compassion, from beginning to end, never slackened, and the lessons I have learned are the greatest. The late Prime Minister was a Christian. He gained from Jesus the liberation of small and weak nations and the happiness of suffering nations. His heroic spirit will last forever, and his light will compete with the sun and the moon. As one who has engaged in the Chinese National Revolution, my belief in the Prime Minister was firm. Although there was no religious relationship at the time, it was no different from religion, that is, a religious-like belief. This is why I have always been a follower of the Prime Minister's Three People's Principles to save the country and the people, and now I have become a believer in Jesus to save people and the world, so I feel that those who engage in revolution rely on the personality of faith. Whenever they are in difficult times or encounter adversity, they will never sacrifice their lives to damage their personality. This is due to their confidence in their faith. In short, our lives can be sacrificed, our bodies can be bound, but our faith and spirit can never be subjugated, which is also due to the self-confidence in our faith. On the day we commemorate the suffering of Jesus, we are even more moved. We especially talk about the importance of faith in life, religion, and revolution to the heart of faith. This is the case. What is said above is only to present what I have gained in my life of faith, and to respectfully verify the Tao with real events. I dare not show off, and I wish your meeting a successful agreement.

### Shanghai Gold Exchange's Request Denied by Ministry of Finance

[Nanjing] The Shanghai Gold and Drug Exchange Brokers Association, etc., jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that temporary profit-making business income be offset against losses and settled annually. It is now learned that this case has been thoroughly studied by the Ministry of Finance and the following instructions have been given: After investigating the regulations implementing the provisional regulations on income tax, Article 12 stipulates that the profit-making business should be calculated at the end of each transaction, and the amount of income is clearly stipulated in Article 19 of the same regulations. The method of calculating net profit is also clearly stated in Article 15 of the regulations. The buying and selling of each trading client should be limited to futures, which is significantly different from the nature of other profit-making businesses, and their buying and selling can be settled at any time, so profits and losses should be calculated independently. If there is a surplus, after deducting expenses, taxes should be levied at the rate. The two points in the petition, offsetting profits and losses and settling annually, are inconsistent with the regulations and are difficult to approve. Please inform and pass this on to all brokers to be responsible for withholding taxes in accordance with the law. (Note: Do not delay. Further news: The association also submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the tax rate for temporary profit-making business income in Category 1, Item C be changed to be the same as that in Item A, which was also rejected.)

### British-Japanese Relations and China

In recent discussions in the British and Japanese parliaments, the issue of British-Japanese relations has been repeatedly raised. And every time this issue is raised, it inevitably involves our country. The reason for this is very clear. Japan's continuous advances in our country have aroused resentment from other countries with related interests, causing Japan's diplomatic position to fall into isolation. This time, the appointment of Sato Naotake, as an envoy to Europe, as Foreign Minister is intended to break through this diplomatic difficulty. However, if Japan wants to ease the resentment of various countries, it must solve the fundamental problem of its policy towards China. Therefore, when the British and Japanese parliaments discuss their mutual relations, the China issue naturally becomes an important focus.

This situation should be given special attention in the minds of our people. In the recent period, the strength of our nation's unity against foreign aggression is gradually being developed, causing the aggressors to be wary. We stand in our own position and have a firm and unwavering demand, which is the independence of our sovereignty and the integrity of our territory. We seek friends in the world who treat us equally on the basis of this complete autonomy, and we seek peaceful and mutually beneficial development in the international community. However, if other countries, in requesting diplomatic relations, use our country as an object of exchange for interests, it is not allowed by our country.

We are well aware that Great Britain and Japan have very broad and complex interests in the Far East. Because of this broad and complex relationship of interests, Great Britain and Japan once formed a close alliance, but they also separated and formed the sharpest opposition. The alliance between Great Britain and Japan in 1902 allowed Japan to gain the benefit of defeating Russia. However, during the European War, Japanese power suddenly developed towards the Pacific coast, hitting Great Britain's position in the Far East. After the war, the British-Japanese alliance dissolved and manifested as various contradictions and disagreements. In 1931, Japan invaded our Northeast. Based on some anti-Soviet ideas, Great Britain also showed some degree of tolerance. This is not difficult to prove in Mr. Stimson's book "The Crisis in the Far East." But later, Japan took step by step and had the momentum to include North China and seize the rights and interests of the Yangtze River area. Great Britain had to rectify its lineup and try to resist. This past history gives us an experience, that is, this kind of combination and separation often makes third parties suffer sacrifices. Now, because Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi and Foreign Minister Sato are advocating coordination with Great Britain, it has aroused an atmosphere in the British and Japanese parliaments of discussing the restoration of the alliance and promoting friendship. And this discussion should take the China issue as the focus of attention. After suffering a lot, we really cannot but be deeply vigilant.

In the past year, Great Britain has taken a fairly strong position against Japan because of the North China issue, the smuggling issue, the Keelung incident, the Siam Canal, and the competition for the vast market in Southeast Asia. We have seen this. We also understand that Great Britain supports our country's currency reform, helps our country's railway development, and enhances the cooperation and connection between Hong Kong and South China. For the sake of our nation's autonomy and liberation, we welcome all countries to cooperate with our country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Based on this principle, in addition to welcoming Great Britain's kindness and help, we also strive to cooperate with democratic and peaceful countries such as the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. However, in the end, we still have to say one more thing. The problems of China must still be determined by the Chinese themselves. If there is any hindrance to our autonomous position, the result will inevitably be that we are sacrificed. But we must resolutely oppose it.

### Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry Holds Symposium on China Issue

Many Prominent Figures from Political and Business Circles Attended. Acknowledged that the Methods of the Mainland Policy Were Clumsy. Remain Temporarily Observant on the North China Issue.

[Tokyo] Last night (the 25th), the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry invited Japanese experts on China issues to discuss the following four questions: ㊀ What policies should be adopted to adjust Sino-Japanese relations? ㊁ What policies should be adopted to unify Japan's national opinion on China? ㊂ How to resolve the North China issue? ㊃ What are the specific policies to promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation? Attendees included former Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro, former Ambassador to China Ariyoshi Akira, President of the Toyo Colonization Co., Ltd. Yasukawa Yunosuke, Managing Director of the East Asia Development Co., Ltd. Uchida Katsuji, President of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Association Takagi Rikuro, former Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Matsumoto Tadao, Director of Mitsui & Co. Fukushima Yoshitsugu, Member of the House of Peers Sakanishi Rihachiro, Shigejiro of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Shibayama Kenjiro, totaling more than 30 people. As a result of the discussion, general opinion agreed on the following points: ㊀ Japan's recent attitude towards China has tended to reflect on itself. However, if this trend of reflection goes too far, it seems to give the people of other countries the impression that Japan's past actions were actually unfair. ㊁ Japan implemented its mainland policy with extremely clumsy methods, leading to various misunderstandings. Therefore, in the future, full attention should be paid to this point. ㊂ China's recent words and deeds seem to overestimate its national power. Therefore, it is not yet the time to talk about adjusting China's relations. Japan should maintain a wait-and-see attitude and wait for China to calm down and have a proper understanding of itself. ㊃ Regarding the resolution of the North China issue, Japan should also maintain a wait-and-see attitude. However, since the North China issue is the crux of Japan's diplomacy towards China, there should be a thorough understanding of it. ㊄ The unification of Japan's system and laws on diplomacy towards China is extremely important. ㊅ China's view is that if political issues are not adjusted, there is no possibility of promoting economic cooperation in practice. Therefore, the specific policies that should be adopted at present are: A. Promote cooperation between individuals; B. Encourage private individuals to provide loans to China, and formulate a loan guarantee law so that the government can guarantee them; C. Develop Yokohama Specie Bank and make it an organization to assist Japanese enterprises in China and assist their financing; D. Japan should pay considerable attention to the recent expansion of British interests in China and South China. It is reported that the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry is also planning to propose the establishment of a Sino-Japanese joint venture to develop North China. However, because there was insufficient time last night, this proposal was not brought up for discussion. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

### Japan Prepares to Negotiate with Us

Abolish Perpetual Lease Rights

[Tokyo] After obtaining guarantees from the United Kingdom and the United States to abolish perpetual lease rights after five years, Japan is now conducting similar negotiations with Italy and France. China is also one of the eleven countries enjoying perpetual lease rights. The total area of perpetual lease is about 900 mu [~60 hectares], distributed in Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, and other places. Most of the perpetual leases of the United Kingdom and the United States are in Yokohama, totaling more than 500 mu [~33 hectares]. China accounts for about 63 mu [~4.2 hectares], separately enjoyed by 46 people, mostly in Yokohama. It is reported that Japan will soon propose similar negotiations to China. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[London] Regarding the issue of the rights to permanently lease land enjoyed by the United Kingdom in some cities in Japan, the United Kingdom and Japan have signed an agreement stipulating that the United Kingdom will give up these rights. After the agreement was signed, people in Tokyo expressed sympathy for the United Kingdom, so people in the know here are also very satisfied and expect that other countries concerned will soon be able to establish similar solutions with Japan. As a result, Japanese public opinion may change its attitude and support the policy of restoring international cooperation. (Havas dispatch from the 25th)

### Sino-Japanese Economic Circles to Form Committee

Each Side of the Committee Will Have 15 Members. Divided into Spinning, Cotton, Finance, and Other Departments.

⊙ Osaka Mr. Miyakegawa Akiyama (Mitsubishi Corporation), who returned to China earlier from the economic survey group visiting China, said the following about this visit: "Regarding the results of our visit to China, there are various opinions in the world. If the Sino-Japanese financial circles in Shanghai do not express their sincerity at the informal meeting, the ending will be nothing more than a superficial form of diplomacy and will be meaningless. Therefore, this time we disclosed and exchanged opinions to our heart's content. What is rumored seems to be a conflict of opinions. As for the first meeting, in order to make economic cooperation between the two countries concrete, two committees, finance and industry, were established. The Japanese members will be decided after returning to Beijing. The committee will generally have 15 members on each side and will be divided into spinning, cotton, finance, and other departments to submit proposals for discussion. The actual organization will be handled by the head of the group, Kodama. The Chinese side's attitude is very prudent. Sometimes, they also raise the North China issue, but our mission is limited to economic matters, so we did not cross that difficult hurdle. In short, we did not expect all cooperation in the first visit to China. Now that it is like this, it can be said that we have obtained considerable achievements. In the near future, a bright era of economic cooperation between the two countries will definitely appear, and there is no doubt about it." (Domei dispatch on the 26th)

### The Future of the Non-Intervention Plan in the Spanish Civil War Becomes More Optimistic Again

The UK Expresses Unwillingness to Accept France's Proposal. Negotiations on the Withdrawal of Volunteer Soldiers Will Reopen.

[London] The tone of British newspapers towards Italy has recently changed. This is evidence that after Foreign Minister Ciano's negotiations with British Ambassador Sir Drummond a few days ago, the British government has satisfied Italy. On the other hand, Italian Ambassador to the UK Grandi also repeatedly assured that the Italian government had no intention of waiving the non-intervention pledge and did not intend to withdraw from the Adjustment Committee. Therefore, the future of the Spanish Civil War non-intervention issue is more optimistic. It is generally believed that negotiations on the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers will resume soon after the upcoming Easter and that one of the following two points will be selected as the basis for the negotiations: ㊀ The Spanish Republican government and the Italian government both advocate that negotiations on the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers should be conducted diplomatically between the countries concerned. The Adjustment Committee should be recognized in principle and publicly announce that these negotiations have been underway. ㊁ Or the Adjustment Committee will study the issue of the repatriation of volunteer soldiers from various countries after the end of the Spanish war. In addition, regarding the Spanish Republican government's lawsuit against Italy's intervention in the civil war to the League of Nations, it is generally known that the British authorities' investigation has not confirmed that Italian regular troops have indeed intervened in the Spanish civil war. Therefore, if the Spanish government does file a lawsuit with the League of Nations, the United Kingdom will not support it in the current situation. (Havas dispatch from the 25th)

[London] According to news from powerful sources here, France has proposed to the United Kingdom a Four-Power naval control plan in order to prevent foreign volunteer soldiers and munitions from re-entering Spain. It is said that the plan is to authorize the navies of Italy, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to limit the progress of vessels of countries that have signed the non-intervention agreement when they go to Spain. (National Telegram on the 25th)

[London] The British side indicated today that the government is unwilling to accept the plan proposed by France to interfere in the Spanish affairs, especially with regard to Italy. At the same time, there is great anxiety here about the news from Paris that France is prepared to demand that Italians be forcibly prevented from going to Spain to fight for the rebels. (National Telegram on the 25th)

### Spanish Government Sends Note to the UK

Determined to Safeguard Sovereignty and Monitor Italian Navy

⊙ Valencia The Spanish Republican government sent a note to the British government on the 23rd of this month. After the cabinet meeting today, the content of the note will be released to the newspapers. The note stated that the monitoring plan proposed by the London Adjustment Committee would divide the sea area under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government to Germany and Italy, and especially the Italian navy would carry out monitoring. Italy is now openly providing assistance to the Spanish rebels, and in the future, it can increasingly engage in espionage activities for the rebels in order to achieve its aggressive plot. This method is absurd and unfounded in terms of legal principles. The Spanish Republican government is now determined to do everything possible to protect its sovereignty, regardless of the consequences. As for the civil war, if it expands due to the Adjustment Committee's procrastination, the Spanish Republican government will not bear any responsibility. (Havas dispatch from the 25th)

### Important Reform of New American Warship

[Washington] It was learned today that there is a very important reform in the US Navy's construction plan, that is, all places where nails are used in the construction of warships will be replaced with welding.

### Important Change in the Southern European Situation: Political and Economic Agreement Established Between Italy and Yugoslavia

Mutual Respect for Territorial Integrity; Promotion of Close Economic Cooperation; Agreement Valid for Five Years

⊙Belgrade: In recent years, Italy and Yugoslavia have had strained relations and a tense situation due to disputes over territorial rights in the Adriatic Sea and other matters. Now, an agreement has been signed, which may mark the beginning of an important new chapter in Southern European history. Italy is currently at odds with Britain and France, and this agreement could provide assistance from a strong neighbor. Italy had been striving to improve relations with Yugoslavia since it began its invasion of Abyssinia and faced resistance from various parties, and now this goal has been achieved. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 26th)

⊙Capital of Yugoslavia: Italy and Yugoslavia concluded an important political agreement this afternoon. Foreign Minister Ciano represented the "King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia" in signing the agreement, while Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović represented Yugoslavia. The formal text of the agreement is very brief, consisting of eight articles. One article specifically addresses the issue of Albania, and another stipulates that the agreement is valid for five years. If neither signatory declares its termination before the expiration date, its validity will be extended for one year, and it can be renewed in the same way each year thereafter. The agreement will come into effect once both signatories have ratified it and exchanged ratification documents in the Yugoslav capital. The main articles of the agreement are excerpted below:

### Main Articles of the Political Agreement

㊀The signatory parties mutually guarantee to respect each other's common borders on land and in the Adriatic Sea. If either signatory is invaded by another country, the other signatory shall not take any action that would benefit the invading country.

㊁In the event of international disputes, the signatory parties shall agree on joint measures to defend their common interests if they are threatened.

㊂The signatory parties declare their common desire to resolve any conflicts or disputes that may arise between them by peaceful means and solemnly pledge not to resort to war in their mutual relations.

㊃In order to respect each other's territorial integrity, the signatory parties agree not to encourage any actions aimed at undermining the territorial integrity or political system of either party.

㊄The signatory parties shall seek to develop mutual trade relations. Regarding this matter, an agreement shall be concluded separately by both parties in the near future to regulate it.

㊅The signatory parties agree that this treaty shall not be deemed to conflict with any existing international commitments of either signatory. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 25th)

### Economic Agreement Contains Six Items

⊙Capital of Yugoslavia: In addition to establishing a government agreement, Italy and Yugoslavia have also signed an economic agreement, the main points of which are as follows:

㊀Existing trade agreements on the import of Yugoslav products into Italy, which already have quotas, will be relaxed in the future. ㊁Certain special products from Yugoslavia, currently paid for in cash by Italy, may be paid for through clearing arrangements in the future. ㊂Most-favored-nation treatment shall apply to bilateral economic relations. ㊃Within one month of this agreement coming into effect, a permanent Italian-Yugoslav Economic Committee shall be established and shall meet at least once a year, alternately in the capitals of both countries. ㊄This agreement is only a preliminary basis for maximizing economic cooperation between the two parties. ㊅The validity period of this agreement shall be the same as that of the political agreement. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 26th)

### Italian and Yugoslav Foreign Ministers Issue Declarations

Reconciliation Between the Two Countries Helps European Peace

⊙Capital of Yugoslavia: After the conclusion of the important treaty between Italy and Yugoslavia this afternoon, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano issued a statement to the press, saying that he deeply believed that this treaty was conducive to the realization of general peace in Europe, especially peace along the Adriatic coast. He also stated that he had just received a telegram from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating that 28 political prisoners of Yugoslav minority ethnicity within Italy had been released. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović also issued a statement, strongly asserting that this treaty was not concluded in opposition to any other country. Furthermore, political figures believe that the rapprochement between Italy and Yugoslavia is the result of Italy's recent change in attitude, which is commendable. Ten years ago, former Prime Minister Bašić had already made rapprochement with Italy his national policy, and all of Yugoslavia's allied countries also supported this policy. Since then, it had not been realized due to various twists and turns, and it has only now returned to the old path of ten years ago. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 25th)

⊙Capital of Yugoslavia: After the establishment of the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia has, in essence, recognized the Italian Empire, which can be seen in the mutual congratulatory remarks. Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović hosted a banquet for the Italian Foreign Minister last night and delivered a speech, saying, "This agreement is by no means directed against any country, and Yugoslavia will continue to faithfully fulfill its obligations to all friendly nations as in the past." At this point, he raised his glass to wish happiness to King and Emperor Victor Emmanuel III and prosperity to Italy, as well as good health to Count Ciano. In response, the Italian Foreign Minister said, "Having received generous hospitality from the Yugoslav government, the mutual friendship, trust, and cooperation between the two countries have been reaffirmed." Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, also presented Count Ciano with the Grand Cross of the White Eagle. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)

### Yugoslav Political Circles Comment on the Italian-Yugoslav Agreement

In the Spirit of Mutual Concession, Both Sides Benefit

⊙Capital of Yugoslavia: After the establishment of the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia, political figures here commented that this agreement is based on mutual concessions. The benefits gained by Italy include four aspects: ㊀The Italian Empire has been recognized by Yugoslavia. ㊁Yugoslavia may join the economic part of the Rome Protocols between Italy, Austria, and Hungary. ㊂The status quo of Albanian territory should be recognized by Yugoslavia, although it is not explicitly mentioned, there is a tacit understanding between the two parties. ㊃If either signatory has a conflict with a third country, the other party should remain strictly neutral. The benefits gained by Yugoslavia include five aspects: ㊀Yugoslavia's land and sea borders are guaranteed to be respected by Italy. ㊁Italy promises not to support Yugoslav terrorist groups, namely the Ustaše. ㊂Italian Foreign Minister Ciano issued a statement to the press, stating that the treatment of the Slavic minorities in Gorizia and Istria (formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the European War, and incorporated into Italian territory after the European War) would be improved. ㊃Italy will grant Yugoslavia substantial economic benefits, and will expand its scope in the future. ㊄Italy recognizes the international obligations currently borne by Yugoslavia. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)

### Roman Political Circles Express Gratification

[Rome] After the establishment of the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia, political figures here are very gratified, believing that this move will enable Italy to occupy a superior position in the Mediterranean, strengthen its anti-communist stance, and consolidate the political axis formed by Italy and Germany. At the same time, it can also connect the Little Entente countries with the signatories of the Rome Protocols (Italy, Austria, and Hungary). It is said that the foreign policy pursued by Italy has been based on improving the situation in the Mediterranean for several months. For example, after the establishment of the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement, the threat posed by the British navy to the Italian coast was swept away, one. After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü held talks in Milan, the doubts of various countries along the Mediterranean coast have been dispelled, two. Italy's relations with Egypt are harmonious, and Italy and Greece will also establish an agreement in the near future, three. The policy pursued by Italy in Spain is not to establish a political system in the western Mediterranean that is manipulated by the Soviet Union. As for Eastern Europe, so far, among the three countries of the Little Entente, only Yugoslavia has not approached the Soviet Union. Italy then established a political and economic agreement with it, four. As for Italy's intention to interfere in the province of Dalmatia (on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea) for strategic reasons, now that the Italian-Yugoslav agreement has been announced, the territorial integrity of the Croatian nation within Yugoslavia has been guaranteed (Dalmatian residents belong to the Croatian nation), and in the event of international disputes, Yugoslavia must maintain a neutral position in accordance with this agreement. In this way, Italy can be considered satisfied strategically, so there is no need to covet Dalmatia any longer. The above is in terms of politics. As for the Italian-Yugoslav economic agreement, it stipulates that the two parties should establish a permanent economic committee, just as the Rome Protocols stipulate for Italy, Austria, and Hungary. Furthermore, the Little Entente countries decided last year that each member state could enjoy greater freedom of action in diplomacy. Italy can cite this to take action with Central European countries in the economic field. In addition, regarding the negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia, Italy has notified Austria and Hungary at any time in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Protocols. Among them, although Hungary has territorial demands on Yugoslavia, it is heard that Italy has advised Hungary to abandon them. In addition, Italian political figures believe that the agreement established between Italy and Yugoslavia can strengthen Italy's position in the Mediterranean. Moreover, because Italy opposes the restoration of the old Habsburg imperial family, advocates maintaining the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, and advocates promoting economic cooperation, Italy can become an important factor in stabilizing the situation in Central Europe.

### French Press Observations

Recognized as Estranging the Little Entente

[Paris] After the establishment of the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia, various newspapers here have commented on it. Le Petit Parisien stated, "This agreement is not harmful to Yugoslavia's allies. Italy has obtained a powerful support in the Balkans. It should be noted that this support can be manipulated by Yugoslavia." L'Echo de Paris, on the right wing, stated, "The relations between Italy and Yugoslavia have now returned to normal, but what is the price paid by Yugoslavia? This is what we want to know." L'Ère Nouvelle, of the Radical-Socialist Party, stated that London is optimistic about the future of the Adriatic Pact (i.e., the Italian-Yugoslav agreement), and is encouraging Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, to promote the policy of cooperation between Italy and Yugoslavia. It is a pity that what Britain is doing in the Balkans is not entirely the same as French policy." Le Populaire, of the Socialist Party, stated, "Italian Foreign Minister Ciano said that this agreement is a bilateral agreement, which shows that Ciano has adopted the plan advocated by German leader Hitler, that is, a plan that stands in opposition to the collective security system, which is undoubtedly true." L'Humanité, of the Communist Party, stated, "The alliance treaty established between Italy and Yugoslavia fundamentally estranges the Little Entente, and also threatens the friendship that France maintains in the Balkan Peninsula. This not only constitutes a great danger in Southeastern Europe, but also in the whole of Europe. In short, the purpose of Ciano's trip is to urge Yugoslavia to join the Fascist group as soon as possible." (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 26th)

### Germany and Austria Welcome It

[Berlin] After Italy and Yugoslavia established an agreement on political and economic affairs, all German newspapers expressed enthusiastic welcome. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated, "Our country has good relations with Italy, and it is the same with Yugoslavia. The political axis formed by Germany and Italy can be further consolidated because of this agreement, which is what we should look forward to." Der Lokalanzeiger stated, "The agreement established between Italy and Yugoslavia is a major diplomatic event. One of the most dangerous pages in history since the European War has now become a thing of the past." The Berliner Tageblatt stated, "Some say that peace is indivisible. This claim has been dealt a blow by the agreement established between Italy and Yugoslavia. The political axis formed by Berlin and Rome is shining brightly on the cause of peace. This is truly commendable." (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)

[Vienna] Here, because Austria is adjacent to the territories of Italy and Yugoslavia, there was always fear that Austria's position would be dangerous when the relations between the countries were tense. Now that it is heard that Italy and Yugoslavia have established a political and economic agreement, all newspapers here express their welcome. The semi-official newspaper Bundespost stated, "This agreement is one of the most important documents in modern diplomacy. Even if the balance of power in Europe does not change because of it, the barriers formed by the League of Nations and the Little Entente/Balkan Entente will not be shaken because of it. Austria is very happy about the reconciliation of the two neighboring countries, even more so than other countries. In short, the political and economic agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia can be viewed on the same level as the Rome Protocols." (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)

### Hungary Surprised

⊙Hungarian Capital: Political figures here are surprised by the speed with which Italy and Yugoslavia have established a political and economic agreement. They believe that when the Italian Prime Minister delivered a speech in Milan in December last year, he still supported Hungary's request to amend the Treaty of Trianon. Up to this point, he has established an agreement with Yugoslavia, forbidding demands for the revision of the Yugoslav border (including the border between Yugoslavia and Hungary), which is what Hungarian people have been striving for. For the sake of the present, it is only hoped that Italy will use its influence to improve the situation of the Hungarian minority within Yugoslavia, which is probably all that can be done. In addition, people in the economic sector are worried that the grains and livestock produced by Hungary will compete with Italian products in the Yugoslav market in the future.

In addition, an agreement was concluded on the methods by which the Romanian army would place orders with Czech factories. Tătărescu has now completed his official duties and left here for Brno, Czech Republic, and will then return to the Romanian capital from there. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### The Cruel Behavior of the Italian Army in Abyssinia is Disgraceful Due to the Silence of the Great Powers

Repeated Discussions in the British House of Commons; Lloyd George Speaks Up for Justice

[London] During the final debate in the House of Commons today before Easter, the Abyssinian massacre was brought up for discussion again, and the government was subjected to fierce attacks from various opposition parties. At the time, there were those who demanded that the government lodge a serious protest with Italy regarding the Italian massacre in Abyssinia, but the government spokesman replied that this matter should be handled through the League of Nations mechanism through collective action. And because the relationship between Britain and Italy has become fragile, Parliament should restrain from actions motivated by emotion. The most noteworthy thing in Parliament today was former Prime Minister Lloyd George's account of the situation in Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, after the assassination of Italian Governor Graziani, in which Abyssinian people were massacred, saying that this was "the most frightening massacre in fifty years." Then, Labour MP Henderson began to discuss the incident, saying that according to the report of the US representative in the Abyssinian capital, he had sheltered 700 Abyssinian refugees in three days. Later, the US representative requested the Italian authorities to guarantee their safety, and after the Italian authorities agreed, the 700 people were released. Unexpectedly, these Abyssinian people were massacred after leaving the US representative's house, like slaughtered livestock, with no survivors. At this time, Lloyd George immediately stood up to question what actions the government had taken regarding this massacre, and cited the precedent of Britain protesting the Armenian massacre in the past, suggesting that this matter "should be subject to a joint international protest by the League of Nations for the most frightening massacre in half a century." At the same time, Lloyd George also said that General Graziani was a great and good soldier, so he also expressed his joy that Graziani was able to escape danger. Lloyd George continued, currently, filing a protest cannot bring the thousands or tens of thousands who have died back to life, but it can save hundreds of thousands who are waiting to die in the next few months. Regarding the killing of Abyssinian General Ta's Tai, Lloyd George considered it to be an unprecedented event in modern history, because Ta's Tai fought for the country, but now he is killed like a dog, and the great powers of the League of Nations are silent and have no word, which is a shameful matter. The Italian people are very angry with the British people, but the anger of the Italian people is better than the contempt of the Italian people, so I hope that the British people in the future can rise up and compete with Italy with a spirit of frankness and fearlessness. Deputy Foreign Secretary Cranborne replied that the tragedy in Addis Ababa, the various speeches made by Henderson, Lloyd George, and the Archbishop of Canterbury proved the concern of the majority of the British people. Regarding this matter, the government spokesperson has made considerable statements. Now, Henderson, George, and others do not want me to state what actions the government has taken, but the Abyssinian dispute cannot be resolved by a single country's independent action, but must be resolved by the united action of other countries in the League of Nations. And because the relationship between Britain and Italy has become fragile, each Member of Parliament should exercise self-restraint even if they are deeply stimulated. The House of Commons then announced an adjournment and will reconvene on the sixth of next month. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 25th)

### British Cabinet Members Spend the Holiday

Departing for Various Places to Rest; Lord President of the Council and Secretary of State for War Remain in the Capital

[London] During the Easter holiday, the British King and Queen will take their two daughters and quietly stay at the royal residence in Windsor Castle. Only the Queen Mother Mary will go to meet them. The cabinet members have left for various places to rest. Only Lord President of the Council MacDonald and Secretary of State for War Cooper will remain in the capital so that they can handle any urgent government affairs. All socialist groups in the country are not relaxing because of the holiday. They are still busy holding meetings these days to discuss issues such as raising the status of workers, the attitude that the socialist party should take toward the government's national defense program, and the establishment of a unified front. Two hundred thousand cars that were idle in winter have reappeared today, making the road lively. Although the airlines have doubled the number of flights to Europe, they are still insufficient to transport those who are going on vacation. The railway company is now adding several trains to transport passengers from London to major cities and the countryside. The Great Western Railway Company announced the opening of several "Honeymoon Express" trains, specializing in carrying newlyweds on holiday trips. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### The Entire Xianghe Embankment is Completed

Hunan Province Continues to Build the Tianyou Embankment

Hankou Correspondence: Zhongxianghe Embankment, a lifeline guarantee for eleven counties and cities, including Zhongda, was built with millions of dollars allocated by the National Economic Council. After two years, it was fully completed on the 15th of this month. Huang Shao-hong, Chairman of the Provincial Government, went to Shagang on the morning of the 24th to inspect it. Xi De-jiong, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and Shi Yu-ling, Commissioner of the Third District, accompanied him. When the embankment was completed, the Post-Disaster Reconstruction Committee telegraphed the National Economic Council, the Wuhan Headquarters, and the Hubei Provincial Government to send personnel for acceptance. The National Economic Council specially dispatched Chen Zhan-en, a technician, and Qiu Xi-jue, a technician. The Wuhan Headquarters dispatched Li Qian-fu and Wu Guo-bing. The Provincial Government dispatched Wu Ting-yang and Yang Si-lian as commissioners to inspect and accept it. They also departed from Hanshan on the same day. Chen Ru-zhen, Director of the Third Department of the Post-Disaster Reconstruction Committee, Zhang You-xian, Director of the Public Works Office, and Shi Xiao-zhong, Director of the Administrative Office, accompanied them.

Regarding the case of Hunan Province building the Tianyou Embankment to block the Dongting Lake surface, the Executive Yuan has telegraphed the Hunan Provincial Government to stop construction. However, Hunan Province stated that the Tianyou Embankment cannot be stopped, and the Hunan Provincial Bank has allocated an additional 100,000 yuan for construction, which is actively underway. However, the people of western Hunan do not agree with this. It is said that ten representatives, including Guo Heng, have been selected to request the government to build in proportion, because if this embankment is completed, Hubei Province will suffer from floods, while the area of western Hunan will be prone to floods because the embankment blocks the passage of mountain floods. A delegation of representatives from the Hubei Province Hometown Association, consisting of 120 people, including Kong Geng, held an emergency meeting on the 24th and resolved to telegraph Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Executive Yuan to request effective measures to stop it, and to submit a request to the Wuhan Headquarters and the Hubei Provincial Government to quickly telegraph the central government. At the same time, staff members were selected to go to the Hunan Provincial Government to negotiate a halt to construction, and a telegraph was sent directly to the Hunan Provincial Government to make the same request.

### Anhui Province's New Tea is About to Enter the Market

Advocating Early Picking and Tender Plucking Methods to Improve Quality and Increase Production

Wuhu Correspondence: The tea-producing areas of Anhui Province have always centered on Huining, Liu Huo in the northern and southern regions. Southern tea is sold to the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and overseas, while northern tea is sold to the northern and northwestern provinces of China. Therefore, in addition to the province's self-sufficiency, the export value reaches tens of millions of yuan each year. In recent years, with the gradual increase of highways and railways, transportation has become extremely convenient. In addition, the government has comprehensively supervised and promoted improvements in quality and marketing. For example, last year's unified marketing of Anhui and Jiangxi black tea opened up direct foreign sales channels, eliminating the drawbacks of monopoly exploitation by intermediaries in the past. It also eliminated the bad practices of tea shops deducting sample tea, releasing weighing money, and finding end discounts from tea farmers in the past. Therefore, the quality has improved and the output has increased, and significant results have been achieved. Currently, Anhui Province's northern and southern "before rain" new tea will be available on the market in the middle of next month. Liu Yi-yan, Director of the Department of Construction, went to Qimen to guide the direction of black tea improvement. Liu Shu-fan, a specialist assigned by the Provincial Rural Cooperative Committee to reside in Qimen and organize tea production and sales cooperation, also announced the methods of early picking, tender plucking, and graded plucking to tea farmers as the new tea is about to enter the market, and to follow them. His announcement stated, "Qimen black tea has always been world-renowned, and annual exports are related to the national economy and people's livelihood. In recent years, it has gradually declined, which is truly heartbreaking. Not only has the price been sharply reduced, but it has even been refused to leave the country. The cause of the problem is rough picking and indiscriminate manufacturing. If this is not improved for a long time, the elimination of black tea will be alarming. The Ministry has repeatedly ordered rectification and the promotion of cooperation. Packaging, processing equipment, and personnel will be assigned to guide the truth. In a blink of an eye, maocha will be on the market, and the quality should be extremely refined. Tender picking is a good method, and early picking is also a good experience. If graded picking can be carried out, production can be further increased. Not only can the reputation of tea be restored, but also more profit can be obtained. It is related to your people's livelihood, and you must not regard it as a mere formality. Therefore, I sincerely admonish you, and you must all abide by it. (25th)"

### Fujian Province Plans to Build Two Railways

Electrical Undertakings Are Also Under Development

Fuzhou Dispatch: Proposals for the construction of the Min-Gan (Fujian-Jiangxi) and Min-Yue (Fujian-Guangdong) railway lines have been around for a long time, but have not been realized due to lack of funding. This time, Chen Yi, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, went to Beijing to discuss the implementation methods with the central government. At the same time, the authorities of Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces also expressed their support. The Min-Gan Railway is planned to start from Yanping in northern Fujian, pass through Shunchang, Shaowu, Guangze, and end at Guixi in Jiangxi, connecting with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Economic Commission had previously sent a team to survey the route once. It is 296 kilometers long and requires a construction cost of 35 million yuan. The central government plans to undertake two-thirds of the cost, and Fujian and Jiangxi provinces will jointly undertake one-third. The survey cost of 60,000 yuan will be borne equally by Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. The Min-Yue Railway will start from Songyu in southern Fujian, pass through Zhangzhou, Nanjing, Longyan, Yongding, Dabu, and end at Chao'an in Guangdong, connecting with the Chaoshan Railway. The mileage and construction costs will be determined after a team is sent to survey the route. The Guangdong side is very keen to build it and plans to issue public bonds. In addition to covering the project costs within Guangdong Province, a portion will be allocated to subsidize the project costs within Fujian Province. The remaining amount will be planned by the Fujian side itself. However, with Fujian Province's current financial strength, it is impossible to build two railways at the same time. It is also unknown whether the Min-Gan Railway will be built first, and then the Min-Yue Railway. Recently, Fujian Province has paid considerable attention to the development of electrical undertakings. In addition to organizing an official-private Electricity Plant Operation Improvement Association as an agency for planning and improving electrical undertakings, it has also decided to issue 720,000 yuan in electricity industry bonds for purchasing machinery to expand electricity plants in various places. Recently, Mr. Litzmann, a German electrical engineer from the Shanghai Siemens Foreign Firm, was hired to survey the hydropower potential of Putian, Xianyou, Yongchun, Anxi, Nanjing, Liancheng, Yong'an, Shaxian, Nanping, Jian'ou, Jianyang, Shaowu, Pucheng, Shunchang, Gutian, and other counties, paying particular attention to Jiuli Lake in Xianyou. According to a survey by the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, the lake has 1,400 horsepower. According to the plan of the Electricity Business Office, if a hydropower plant is built, it will cost 500,000 yuan and can supply electricity to Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, and several other counties in southern Fujian. Mr. Litzmann has departed with Liu Jinzhao, the chief engineer of the Water Conservancy Office, to survey various places in southern Fujian, and then go to northern Fujian for surveying.

### Japan's Justice League Establishes Branch in Xiamen

The Political Implications of the League are Worth Noting; Strangers Are Not Allowed to Enter the Heshan Area of Xiamen Without Permission

Xiamen Dispatch: The Japanese "Justice League Shrine" is a very powerful religious organization in Japan. Its members are scattered throughout Japan and various parts of China. It has branches in China to promote religion and carries political implications. After the September 18th Incident, Sakaigawa Eizo, a member of the League, led hundreds of armed members to the Northeast to engage in special agent work. In August or September of the year before last, a branch of the League was established in Xiamen. The original branch director was a Japanese named Morita, and the branch address was a Taiwanese inn on Chengguang Road. At that time, there were few members, all of whom were Japanese and Taiwanese. Mr. Zheng advanced several hundred yuan in expenses. Later, Morita had a conflict with a reporter from the Quanmin Xinbao, which was run by a Japanese. The newspaper's president sued the Japanese consulate, which forwarded the case to the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, and Morita was transferred back. Recently, Sakaigawa has reassigned a Taiwanese named Mr. Chen as the branch director of the League in Xiamen. The branch address has been moved to the second floor of Xiaodian Street Bridge Pavilion. Currently, there are more than 200 members, and they are still widely recruiting, regardless of nationality. The entry procedure requires the introduction of two members, a written application, the implementation of its purpose, and obedience to its rules and regulations. This kind of organization is worth noting.

Xiamen is a treaty port open to foreign trade. However, the commercial area is limited to the urban area, which is now under the jurisdiction of the Xiamen Municipal Police Department, bounded by the sea to the west, the mountains to the east, Meirengong to the northeast, and Bipao Terrace to the southeast. The entire island of Xiamen outside the urban area is the Heshan Special Zone, under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Administrative District. According to the treaty, foreign residents can only reside in the commercial area and cannot enter the interior without permission. Occasionally, a passport from the consulate and the local government is required. However, in fact, Japanese nationals currently come and go to Heshan, and some even sneak in and live there. Since last winter, Taiwanese have been sneaking into the interior of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou and living there in increasing numbers. The political and military authorities have strictly cracked down on this. For example, during the New Year this year, 15 staff members of the Xiamen Taiwanese Residents Association traveled to Heshan and crossed the sea to Jimei in Tong'an County. They were checked by the garrison and found to have no permits. They were sent to Tong'an for detention. Later, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen requested the municipal government to send personnel to retrieve them. The detainees sent a letter of apology, and the matter was settled. Recently, the Heshan Special Zone Office has also prohibited foreigners from entering the Heshan area. At 9:00 AM on the 19th of this month, a Japanese named Seegawa Choichi, accompanied by a Taiwanese, took a car to Jiangtou and got off, intending to walk to Fanghu Zhongzhai for sightseeing. Special agents from the District Office followed them midway and checked their permits. As they had no passports, they were immediately ordered to leave the area, and the two returned to Xiamen by car.

### Guangdong Salt Merchants Unanimously Strike

Opposing the Imposition of Additional Taxes on Guangdong Salt; Salt Prices in Various Places Suddenly Become Expensive; Salt Stored in Beijiang Ordered to Be Inventoried

Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, Guangdong salt merchants believe that there are many obstacles after the implementation of the Guangdong salt sales cooperation method in Hunan. They have sent telegrams to the Guangdong and Hunan salt administration authorities and the Ministry of Finance to request improvements to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. While negotiations are underway, the Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Transport Envoy Office has been ordered to increase the additional tax on Guangdong salt. The Upper and Lower River Salt Merchants Association believes that the burden is too heavy and cannot be overcome. In recent days, they have successively stopped allocating and transporting salt, and sent representatives to the Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Transport Envoy Office to appeal for improvements to the Guangdong salt sales method in Hunan and to request the withdrawal of the order to increase the additional tax, but to no avail. The salt merchants were forced to suspend business to wait and see. The Salt Industry Upper and Lower River Associations, the Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Merchants Office, and the Lei-Qiong Salt Transport Merchants Promotion Association convened a joint meeting of all members on the 16th. The chairman reported that salt merchants from various places had sent telegrams requesting tax reductions and improvements to sales channels. Recently, telegrams were received from the Meilu City and Lian County Salt Industry Associations, requesting a united effort to fight for their rights. The salt merchants all agreed to immediately send representatives to Beijing to petition. As for the Guangdong salt sales method in Hunan, it has recently been implemented. On the 15th, the Guangdong Lower River Salt Industry Association received a telegram from Lechang stating that the Hunan Coastal Inspection Office had sent Section Chief Xu Yongxiu to establish an inspection station in Lechang to start inspecting Guangdong salt entering Hunan, and notified the Guangdong salt merchants that from the 16th, they should seal and inventory all salt stored in the stores, and that they would have to pay the salt tax according to the new tax rate for salt transported to Hunan. The salt merchants in Lechang, Pingshi, Nanxiong, Shaoguan, and other places, after receiving the notice, believed that this implementation was particularly harsh and harassing, and unanimously went on strike from the 17th. The Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Transport Envoy Office believed that this matter was being handled under orders. Now that the Lower River Salt Merchants have gone on strike, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, before this case is resolved, the Huai Upper River Salt Merchants will register their stored salt first, and temporarily be exempt from paying the supplementary tax. In addition, salt merchants in other places have also successively stopped allocating and transporting salt in recent days due to their opposition to the increase in the additional tax. Salt prices in various places suddenly became expensive. For the sake of alleviating the people's food supply, the Salt Industry Association believes that the number of salt that has been allocated but not transported by salt merchants in various places is very large. It has specially obtained the approval of the salt administration authorities to first transport this unexported salt, and the Salt Industry Association will register it. The unified tax will be temporarily recorded, guaranteed by the association, so that the allocated salt can be transported to various places to alleviate the salt shortage. It is estimated that since the 17th, about 3,000 packs of salt have been released by the association with tax records, in order to slightly suppress salt prices and avoid affecting the people's food supply.

Eight people broke into the house, while the rest guarded the perimeter. Yu and her daughter were doused with kerosene and burned, forced to reveal the location of hidden gold. Her son-in-law Wu Nian'er and eldest daughter were present, but they were not coerced, indicating that the robbers were acquaintances. They searched and robbed for more than an hour before leaving. Yu lost 191 yuan in cash, four gold rings, a gold bracelet, a pearl bracelet, a watch, and several coarse and fine leather coats. The losses of the other two families were also significant. Yu and others suffered severe burns.

### Changshu

Mother and Six Children Buried in a Fire Pit

The home of Shen Qingbao, a farmer in Xinzhaoqiao, Second District, suddenly caught fire yesterday morning, destroying more than ten houses. It was not extinguished until dawn. However, five of the Shen family's children were all burned to death because they could not be rescued in time. Shen Qingbao was a farmer by trade. The day before yesterday, the Ye family in the same village held a funeral, and Shen was hired to help. He did not return until late at night. His wife stayed at home to wait, and because the weather was very cold, she burned a brazier to keep warm. When her husband returned home, he did not extinguish it either. Unexpectedly, at about one o'clock, he suddenly heard the sound of wood exploding and woke up from his dream. However, the fire had already started in front of the bed. Shen rushed to escape and watched as the house was completely destroyed by fire, which then spread to the Shen and Li families next door. Later, the villagers came out to put out the fire, which was not extinguished until dawn. A total of twelve houses were destroyed, and the losses were quite high. The most tragic thing is that Shen's wife and five children were not saved and were all buried in the fire pit. The oldest was thirteen years old, the next eleven, the next eight, the next six, and the youngest was only a few years old. The villagers collected donations to help with the burial.

### Suzhou

Some time ago, when the wealthy couple Lu Pan and Juan Chun in Dengmen were arrested and sent for drug rehabilitation for a drug case, Feng Wangyi, who had been an adjutant in the garrison, defrauded the Chen couple of 1,000 yuan on the grounds of smoothing things over with the authorities. After the case was discovered, Feng Wangyi was arrested at the County Hospital along with witnesses and sent to the County Government, which transferred him to the Local Court for custody and trial. Yesterday, the Local Court sentenced Feng Wangyi to six months' imprisonment and a fine of 300 yuan.

Tragic News of Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Drowning

Su Hesheng, a resident of Shangdian Village, Seventh District, Wuyi, had been making a living as a hired worker. His father died early, and his mother, Zhuang, who was nearly sixty years old, lived with his daughter-in-law, Zhang. Recently, Hesheng suddenly suffered from mental illness, which led to unemployment at home. He often quarreled with his mother. On the evening of the 22nd of this month, he had another argument with his mother. By the morning of the tenth, Zhuang was still unable to calm down and had the idea of ending her life. She went to the nearby Puqing River and committed suicide by drowning. Her daughter-in-law, Zhang, waited for a long time without her return and searched everywhere. When she searched to that place, she saw Zhuang lying in the water. She immediately went forward to rescue her, but accidentally fell into the water. Because it was early in the morning, there was no one to rescue her, and the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law both drowned. Villagers discovered it and fished out the bodies. Zhang Ziqing, Hesheng's father-in-law, prepared coffins for them. The village chief Li Chun, etc., accompanied the bodies to the Local Court on the 25th to request permission to waive the autopsy.

Bandits Robbed a Vat Boat

A crock boat belonging to Zhao Taisheng of Taixian, anchored at the Qijia Yidu Ferry in Yasou Township, Seventh District of Jiangdu, which sells goods in the Dinggou and Fanchuan areas, was approached by a bandit boat. Four bandits armed with knives and sticks shouted and boarded the boat, tied up Zhao and the boatmen, and searched extensively. As the wind and snow were raging, there was no way to call for help. They were robbed of more than one hundred yuan in legal tender and all the items on the boat. The foot oar of the boat was also taken away.

It is also learned that because the departure date is approaching, Kong has many public and private affairs to attend to in Shanghai, so he does not plan to return to Beijing before departure. As for whether he will go to Hangzhou to visit President Jiang, it depends on whether time permits.

Grand Banquet Tomorrow Night

The Municipal Party Headquarters and various agencies and organizations in the city, in order to bid farewell to Special Envoy Kong on the eve of his departure, will hold a grand public banquet at the grand restaurant of the International Hotel at 7:00 PM tomorrow (28th) afternoon to send him off. It is found that dozens of agencies and organizations are participating in the farewell, with more than 300 representatives participating. This is an unprecedented event since the opening of the International Hotel. There are many invited guests.

Pure Mission

The other day, the Japanese-language Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun reported that Kong's trip was charged with the mission of contacting the British to borrow money. A reporter from the New Voice Agency specifically inquired about this with Kong's entourage yesterday, and they solemnly denied it, saying that the various things reported by the Japanese newspaper were not worth believing. The newspaper based its assumption of a mission to contact the British to borrow money on the fact that the special envoy group includes financial experts, which is clearly a conjecture. Even if there are one or two financial officials in the group, it is only because they are afraid that someone will ask Kong, as the Minister of Finance, about the financial situation of our country. If it is within the scope of expertise, it is necessary for officials to be present to provide consultation and provide detailed answers so that foreigners can thoroughly understand the progress of our country's finances at this time. His trip is to attend the coronation ceremony of the British King, and the mission is very simple.

Mr. Wang's Speech

First, Wang Xiaolai, representing the various charitable organizations, delivered a farewell speech, stating in brief that the charitable community colleagues have reluctance about Mayor Wu's appointment to be Chairman of Guangdong. Mayor Wu's guidance and assistance have made the charitable cause successful in the city and made the nationwide charitable relief endeavors possible. The reliance on Mayor Wu is significant. The emotion of farewell is hard to describe. The colleagues hope that Mayor Wu can continue to give instructions.

Mayor's Response

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech in response, saying that he was deeply grateful for the farewell event held by the charitable community of the city. He knew that his ability was weak and the contributions to the district are low during the 6 years of serving as Mayor. But he was loyal to his duties. Remembering the Shanghai residents' shared hardships in the past time in office. He viewed Shanghai as his second home and there are many undertakings underway. He looked forward to local leaders assisting with that. Now he will go to Guangdong, Guangdong and Shanghai are conveniently connected and are commercial centers. He hoped that old friends give instructions from time to time. Tea and refreshments were served, and the event ended.

### Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Public Works Department to Cancel the Proposal to Increase Levies

Chinese Citizens Within the Settlement Completely Disagree, Cannot Be Explained Away by a Simple Majority Vote

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday to oppose the Public Works Department's increase in municipal taxes, stating: "To the Public Works Department of the Public Concession: We are writing regarding the proposed increase in the municipal general tax in the Public Concession from 14% to 16%. According to reports, this proposal was passed at the Board of Directors meeting on the 24th of this month by a vote of six to five. We find this deeply regrettable. We understand that this move by your department is intended to offset the annual deficit, but there are other, more appropriate ways to address this shortfall. For example, the allowances for foreign staff remittances, the expenses of the music corps, and other items have repeatedly been identified by Chinese citizens and trade associations residing within the Concession as areas where cuts could be made to make up the difference. Unfortunately, your department has not adopted these suggestions, choosing instead to focus on non-essential reductions and increased burdens. Our Chamber is confident in asserting that Chinese citizens do not object to the Public Works Department's achieving a balanced budget, but they believe that the balancing policy adopted is inappropriate. During the vote on this matter on the 25th of this month, the Chinese Directors, representing the vast majority of Chinese citizens within the Concession, all voted against it, indicating that the Chinese citizens within the Concession completely disagree with the increase in general tax. The structure of your department is no longer simply an international one, as it once was, but rather an organization based on Sino-foreign cooperation. Therefore, a tax increase policy to which the Chinese citizens are completely opposed cannot be disregarded and explained away by a simple majority vote. Such a trend could undermine the organization that has been built up through previous efforts. Any far-sighted politician capable of harmonizing public sentiment would be able to weigh the importance of matters and avoid stubbornly adhering to preconceived notions. Based on the above reasons, our Chamber hereby requests that your department reconsider the proposed increase in the general tax and cancel this proposal, so that there is room for maneuver. We sincerely hope for this."

### Decision Made by the Third Plenary Session to Recover Pilotage Rights

A case of national pilotage personnel, requesting recovery of pilotage rights and to belong to the Ministry of Transportation, has been resolved by the Fifth Third Plenary Session. According to the requests and proposals of Yang Hu and thirty-nine committee members, the Executive Yuan will handle this. The official reply from the Central Training Department and the Central Secretariat and the letter from the Chinese Seamen's Committee to reclaim pilotage rights to Minister Kong will be recorded as below:

Ministry of Public Instruction

The Chinese Seamen's Special Party Department yesterday received an order from the Central Training Department. The case of determining the Chinese Yangtze River's river management to belong to the Transportation Department and refunding the license fees has been submitted to the Ministry and transferred to the Central Secretariat for concurrent processing and transferred to to be noted. The original letter from the Central Secretariat will be copied and forwarded to be noted. This order. (Attachment: Original letter from the Central Secretariat) The case was approved by your Ministry on March 11 of the 26th year, No. 6447, "According to the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Department, request that the Chinese Yangtze River's river management be handed over to the Ministry of Transportation and refunding the license fees. The Third Plenary Session had a resolution and enclosed the original letter and requested to be replied concurrently." The Third Plenary Session has resolved to recover pilotage rights and to have the pilotage personnel belong to the Ministry of Transportation, proposed by Yang Hu and thirty-nine committee members. The case will be handled by the Executive Yuan. Before the approval letter, the Standing Committee approved, "Send a letter to the Executive Yuan to handle the case according to the Third Plenary Session." In addition to the letter to the Executive Yuan, the corresponding reply is hoped to be noted.

Letter to Minister Kong

Mr. Yonggong, Deputy Chief of the Executive Yuan, I believe that pilotage rights are of utmost importance to national defense and the rise and fall of the nation. After the opening of the five ports for trade, foreign vessels, in order to facilitate their navigation, did not hesitate to undermine our country's pilotage sovereignty. The first was the Pilotage General Regulations established by Hart, which allowed foreigners to freely pilot ships in our ports. Secondly, Dairy transferred the Tongsha to foreigners for exclusive management and operation. At the same time, the Manchu government handed over pilotage affairs to the customs authorities. From then on, pilotage rights in various ports were gradually monopolized by foreigners. The damages suffered over the decades are countless. As far back as the Sino-French War and as recently as the Battle of Shanghai, enemy warships were able to penetrate deep into our territory and cause us to suffer losses, all because of the guidance of foreign pilots. The past is clear and serves as a warning. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, your Executive Yuan promulgated the Provisional Pilotage Regulations, abolishing Hart's General Regulations. The Chinese people were overjoyed, believing that pilotage rights in the various ports could be gradually recovered. However, the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee is still under the responsibility of the customs authorities, and since the establishment of this committee, it has not followed the regulations, so that the government's plan to recover pilotage rights cannot be realized. The national pilotage personnel have been running around and appealing for a long time. The Committee has been organized to support the government in recovering pilotage rights, drawing on the enthusiasm and intelligence of seamen across the country. In the past, representatives were sent to the Third Plenary Session of the National People's Congress to petition. It was proposed to reclaim pilotage rights and assign them to the Ministry of Transportation, which has now been approved in the conference. Because the citizens requested this for years, although approved by the conference, it is hoped to be implemented soon. The revolutionary career is for the citizens, and seamen have always been respected. This request to reclaim pilotage rights is very important to national defense. It is hoped to implement to maintain opinions.

### National Highway Traffic Commission Hosted a Test Ride of Domestically Produced Gas-Powered Vehicle Yesterday

Departing on the 29th for Hangzhou and then Beijing, Will Participate in the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour

The Gas-Powered Vehicle Testing Committee of the National Highway Traffic Commission has completed a gas-powered vehicle and will drive to Hangzhou and then Beijing to participate in the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour. Yesterday, the committee held a tea party at the City Public Bus Management Office to invite people from all walks of life to visit and take a test ride. More than fifty representatives from various automobile companies and newspaper reporters attended. Zhang Dengyi, the chairman of the committee, and others were present to welcome them. First, a tea discussion was held, where Mr. Zhang gave a report. Then, they took the vehicle to Longhua for a week-long test run. Details are recorded below:

Inviting a Tour

In recent years, the active promotion of highway construction and the problems of driving automobiles and the gasoline used are very important. The research on charcoal as a substitute for oil is valued by the Chinese. Although there are many self-made charcoal-powered stoves, the old-style gas stoves are mostly installed on the side of the car, which is quite unsightly. However, the charcoal car parked at the Public Bus Management Office yesterday was completely the same in form as an ordinary long-distance bus. The whole body was painted lake green, which was quite beautiful. The embedded stove was modified under the rear seat. The rear door of the car revealed a horizontally placed iron box with a round cover for adding charcoal, so management was also very convenient. As for the chassis of the car, it uses a large Mengtian 212AS car body, which is very long. The passenger seats are arranged horizontally and forward in five rows, totaling thirty-one seats. They all use spring cushions and backrests, and the seat frames are made of chrome-plated steel pipes, making the interior luxurious and exceptionally comfortable. The guests were all very complimentary after Mr. Zhang explained everything to them. Then, they were invited to the factory for a tea party. A long table of white cloth was filled with fruits and sweets for refreshments, and all around were lathes and various machines. The unique venue made people excited and thought about how much effort the creators put into our enjoyment today.

### Mr. Zhang Dengyi (Ping)

Mr. Zhang's Report

During the tea party, Zhang Dengyi reported on the importance of gas-powered vehicles in our country, focusing on economic and national defense aspects. He said that in recent years, our country has built 100,000 kilometers of highways, with approximately 50,000 automobiles. Economically, the gasoline consumed each year relies on foreign countries, resulting in a loss of more than 40 million yuan. Therefore, critics believe that highway construction is promoting foreign goods and has no benefit to rural areas. There is considerable justification for this criticism. However, if charcoal-powered vehicles are used instead, it can both recover the loss and benefit farmers, as charcoal is a byproduct of rural areas in our country. This is from a national economic perspective. As for national defense, it is even more necessary. Once war breaks out internationally, the supply of gasoline will be cut off, causing panic in national transportation. If the enemy invades, they can use highways to penetrate deep into the interior and control our fate. However, if charcoal-powered vehicles are used instead, this problem can be solved. Even in the event of war, we can fully utilize highways as a major means of transportation.

Invention Process

He continued to describe the invention process of gas-powered vehicles, stating that it has been around for more than twenty years. In 1924, when he was traveling in France, he saw gas-powered vehicles in operation and paid close attention to them. However, in Europe and America, charcoal production is very small. Using gas-powered vehicles requires preparing charcoal in advance, and if charcoal is lacking after the vehicles have been traveling, it cannot be purchased anytime and anywhere, so it is very inconvenient. Our country's situation is the opposite. Charcoal is a daily necessity for households, and it is produced everywhere, especially in the inland areas. The fuel supply for gas-powered vehicles is better than in foreign countries, and our country's oil source relies entirely on imports, so gas-powered vehicles are very suitable in our country and should be promoted. He purchased a gas-powered vehicle from France in 1927 and publicly tested it in Shanghai. Unfortunately, gasoline prices were cheaper at that time, making it difficult to attract attention. In recent years, after Mr. Liu Min, Mr. Tang Zhongming, Mr. Li Baohe, Mr. Xiang Kai, and others engaged in research and manufacturing, the Chinese have gradually gained a concept of gas-powered vehicles, and the research results of foreign countries over the years have also made great progress compared to the past. The National Highway Traffic Commission, recognizing the need for gas-powered vehicles in our country's transportation industry, organized the Gas-Powered Vehicle Testing Committee, with him serving as chairman. Since its establishment, it has been a year and a half. The main task is to collect various gas stoves from foreign countries, research them separately, and try to build our own. Now it has entered the self-built stage. The Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour hosted by the Executive Yuan will be held at the beginning of next month, so a gas-powered vehicle built by the committee will participate in the departure for a long-distance trip test. After the vehicle was built, it was tested once. The ignition time only takes one minute, and it can start in five minutes. Twelve people can be seated in the car. The highest speed on the asphalt road in the city center is 60 kilometers, and the highest speed on the cinder road on Zhongshan Road is 56 kilometers. The most unique point of the vehicle is that white coal can be used as fuel instead, which is durable, reduces the number of times charcoal is added, and increases engine horsepower. We have achieved considerable results. Before this departure, we specially invited people from all walks of life to visit, hoping for guidance.

### Generator Placed in the Back (Ping)

Scheduled Departure

After the tea and refreshments, the vehicle was tested. First, charcoal was used to ignite, and white coal was used to start. The results were excellent. The guests then took a test ride. Because there were many people, another passenger car was prepared to depart together. It passed through Xiexu Road and Jinji Road to Longhua. The whole journey only took thirteen minutes. Then, they returned the same way. The driving speed was stable. The group participating in the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour, led by Director Zhang, will depart on the 29th. They will first go to Hangzhou via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, and then follow the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to Beijing. They will invite people from all walks of life to visit and take a test ride along the way. The car will travel along with the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour in order to test the vehicle's long-distance performance. After returning to Shanghai, multiple vehicles will be built to meet the need.

### Kodama and Others Returned to Japan This Morning, Released a Written Statement Yesterday

Did Not Express Opinions on Questions Asked by Reporters, Zhou Zuomin Also Made a Statement Describing the Results of Mutual Talks

According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese Economic Survey Group, led by Kenji Kodama, arrived in Shanghai on the 14th. They first entered Beijing and stayed for two days, receiving hospitality from political and business circles in our country. Then, they came to Shanghai on the 17th to attend the first member meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association and had discussions with various circles. According to the statement issued, satisfactory results have been obtained. Some of the group members went to Qingdao, Wuhan, and other places after the 20th to investigate the economic situation of our country. The remaining members in Shanghai, including Kenji Kodama, Kyoichi Yutani, and Aiichiro Fujiyama, will return to their country on the Shanghai Maru of the Japanese Post this morning. Reporters made a special visit yesterday.

Visiting Kodama

The main task of Kodama and others in this visit to China was to have discussions with the business and financial circles of our country on the economic cooperation between the two countries, so three symposiums were held. According to the second statement issued, the results were satisfactory. However, there were many dissatisfied opinions in Japanese public opinion. Reporters made an appointment at 4 PM yesterday at the International Hotel to visit Kodama and ask about the details. After Yutani introduced the reporter, Kodama was presented with seven questions translated into Japanese and asked to express his opinions. In addition to questions about the impressions of this visit to China and the results of the talks, it also mentioned how to stop smuggling and atrocities in order to improve the feelings of the people of the two countries. Kodama held the questions and said that he was being tested. There were many Japanese friends in the room at the time, and they all smiled when they heard this. After reading carefully, Kodama solemnly told the reporter that he did not want to answer, saying that expressing too many opinions might cause misunderstandings. The impressions of this visit to China and the results of the talks with various parties have been released in writing.

Written Statement

The statement issued by Kodama and others states that the delegation was given the opportunity to visit China to attend the Sino-Japanese Trade Association Conference. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of Nanjing and officials from all circles of industry and commerce, Mayor Wu of Shanghai, and all circles of finance, industry and commerce have extended their sincere welcome. The Sino-Japanese Trade Association meeting held in Shanghai has concluded satisfactorily. It was decided to establish a complete investigation department for the purpose of promoting economic relations between the two countries. We had the opportunity to stay in Shanghai and have several discussions with the Chinese side. As a result, we were fortunate enough to decide on the following two points: Regarding finance, we will strive to strengthen the mutual connection between financial operators of the two countries in the future. Regarding the cotton industry, we will start to improve cotton and study to increase production. At the same time, for the common interests of increasing Sino-Japanese trade, both parties will nominate a joint representative to consider measures. In addition, regarding other various sectors, we have made progress in mutual understanding. In the future, the two headquarters of the association will organize special committees according to each department to continue to carry out investigation and research. Although our stay in Nanjing and Shanghai was short this time, we had the opportunity to fully exchange opinions with various parties in the government and the public. We respectfully express our respect for the construction atmosphere in China's politics, economy, and other aspects.

Zhou Zuomin's Talk

Mr. Zhou Zuomin, Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, also issued a statement yesterday, saying that Mr. Kenji Kodama, head of the Japanese survey group, and all members are leaders in the economic circles of their country. This joint visit to China is unprecedented. Our government and all circles in Shanghai have extended a sincere welcome. The members have mostly returned to their country. I hope for their safe return soon. When they were in Shanghai, the speeches they made were recorded in detail in various newspapers. The key points of the three talks are as follows: 1. The establishment of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association was originally intended to jointly develop trade between the two countries. At the recent conference, it was decided to enrich the organization and prepare for matters that should be investigated and studied in advance to wait for the opportunity to come. The first thing that the symposium discussed was this matter, and it was planned to set up departments in the two general associations separately to continue to carry out investigation and research. 2. The financial situation of China and Japan. This time, the two sides exchanged opinions frankly and frankly, and both sides have a considerable understanding of each other, and they plan to contact each other in the financial circles of the two countries in the future. 3. The cotton industry is an important production, and representatives are to be nominated jointly to investigate and study the improvement of cotton seeds and the increase in production in order to seek mutual benefit. In addition, various parties were able to exchange opinions as much as possible, but they were all working on investigation and research. The policies and steps that our side should take were explained in detail at the public banquet on the 17th, and I will not repeat them here.

### Yesterday's Report on the Labor Dispute at the Xinyu No. 1 and No. 2 Factories

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the conflict between workers and staff at the Xinyu No. 2 Cotton Mill remained deadlocked yesterday. Workers at the No. 1 Mill, who had resumed work the night before, went on strike again. Party and government authorities mediated yesterday, but the negotiations could not proceed because the management failed to attend. A dispute also broke out among the laborers yesterday, and one worker was arrested but immediately released. Party and government authorities are jointly discussing how to handle the situation. Details are as follows:

Stalemate at Mill No. 2

The dismissal of 56 workers at the Xinyu No. 2 Cotton Mill on Route Robert (劳勃生路8号) triggered a conflict between workers and staff. Although the workers demanded that the mill resume production, the management refused to allow the dismissed workers to enter the factory, preventing resumption of operations. Yesterday morning, the workers continued to wait at the factory gate, but the mill did not sound its whistle and kept its gates tightly closed, resulting in a continued stalemate that is difficult to resolve in the short term.

Strike at Mill No. 1

Over 1,500 workers at the Xinyu No. 1 Cotton Mill on West Suzhou Road (西蘇州路37号) had staged a brief work slowdown at 8:00 PM the night before in support of the smooth negotiation of the No. 2 Mill workers' issue. After persuasion by the police, they resumed work at 8:30 PM. However, the workers were unable to concentrate on their jobs after resuming work and stopped working again at 9:15 PM. The management was unable to dissuade them, so at 9:30 PM on the evening of the 25th, they shut down the mill, dismissed all the workers, and forced them to leave.

Persuading Resumption of Work

After the workers at the Xinyu No. 2 Mill went on strike and left the factory, the management sounded the whistle as usual at 5:30 AM yesterday morning to resume operations. By 6:30 AM, only 150 workers had entered the factory to work. Because the number of workers was too small, it was not feasible to resume operations, so they were assigned miscellaneous tasks. By 6:00 PM in the afternoon, the number of workers had not increased. To prevent the situation from escalating, foremen in each department are currently trying to persuade workers to return to work.

New Worker Attacked

Yesterday morning, striking workers from both mills stood at the corner of Tokyo Road and Route Robert (东京路劳勃生路转角), observing the situation and gathering information. At 7:50 AM, a new worker passed by. Some of the workers believed that he was a representative sent by the management to monitor the workers' actions, so they picked up stones and threw them at him. As a result, the new worker was struck in the head, causing his face to be covered in blood, and he fled with his head in his hands.

Police Suppression

When the conflict broke out between the laborers, the duty police saw the situation and immediately reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, which dispatched two vehicles of armed police to suppress the unrest. A carpenter from the mill, Zhu Yonggui, was seen running wildly and was apprehended by the police. The other workers scattered. The arrested worker was sent to the Putuo Road Police Station and released at 11:30 AM.

Mediation Unsuccessful

The Social Affairs Bureau considered the situation serious, so it convened a meeting between the two sides at the bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday to mediate. Lu Yinchu was sent from the City Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Xu Peijin, Wang Zhengjiao, Yao Yongfu, and Liu Binghua, among others, represented the labor side, totaling twelve people. However, no representative from the management attended until 12:00 PM, preventing mediation from proceeding. After consultation between the Party and government authorities, it was decided to notify the labor representatives of the postponement, reconvene the meeting, and send Zhu Jintao to the mill in the afternoon to investigate.

Mill No. 2's Statement

The Xinyu No. 2 Mill issued a solemn statement yesterday, saying, "Since taking over the mill, workers have repeatedly staged work slowdowns, treating shutdowns as a joke. Although the City Party Headquarters and Social Affairs Bureau have repeatedly mediated, all efforts have been unsuccessful. The mill was forced to formally announce the dismissal of 56 workers on the 24th of this month. That evening, the workers entering the factory again staged a complete work slowdown. In order to maintain the safety of other workers, the mill had no choice but to order the night shift to stop work and simultaneously announce a temporary shutdown the following day to plan for a resolution. At approximately 6:00 AM on the 25th, the already dismissed workers led all the workers in destroying the main gate and rushing to the workshop. Because the iron gate of the workshop was locked, they turned to the administrative office and staff dormitories, shouting 'Fight! Fight!' For a time, sticks and clubs flew everywhere, and all doors, windows, and equipment were damaged. The manager's office and bedroom were particularly badly damaged, lasting for a total of one hour. It is estimated that among the employees who were beaten severely, the cotton mill engineer, He Da, was injured in the forehead by an iron object, and the cloth mill engineer, Fu Hansheng, was dragged out of his room and beaten in a crowd, his face bleeding profusely. Xu Yunbin, the head of the cotton department, was knocked to the ground and beaten with fists and feet, resulting in serious injuries. Yu Yangchun, the fabric mill examiner, was beaten three times and momentarily fainted. Xu Haiquan, a cotton department staff member, was injured by falling debris. Only when a large number of police arrived did the workers scatter. Furthermore, our Mill No. 1 operated as usual yesterday, but at night it was incited by troublemakers and shut down again. Today, only a small number of workers arrived at the factory for the day shift, and the situation is extremely poor. We are currently providing earnest guidance. Once the workers realize their error and return to work, our Mill No. 1 will resume operations as usual. We fear that the public is unaware of the truth, so we issue this solemn statement."

Workers' Meeting

According to Dagong News Agency, all workers were prevented from going to work and intimidated by the mill's staff firing guns, causing extreme resentment. To devise a response, a meeting of all worker representatives was held at 3:00 PM yesterday. A unanimous resolution was passed to await resolution by the Party and government authorities in accordance with the law. After the meeting, labor representatives stated that regarding the No. 2 Mill's renovation of machinery and dismantling of old machines, a labor dispute had once occurred, which was resolved after Party and government mediation. Unexpectedly, the mill suddenly dismissed a large number of workers, disregarding the livelihoods of the workers, and prevented them from going to work, firing guns to intimidate them, and beat workers. Under this oppression, the workers are requesting assistance from the Party and government authorities in accordance with the law to avoid unemployment.

### Chinese Tobacco Merchants Petitioned the Tax Office Yesterday

Narrating the Difficulties of Tobacco Factories　Requesting Approval for Temporary Tax Suspension

The Shanghai Chinese Tobacco Merchants Association, burdened by the Ministry of Finance's increased unified tobacco tax, previously sent representatives, including Shen Weiting, to Beijing to petition, requesting the maintenance of the status quo, which was not approved. Yesterday, the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees decided to send representatives to the Tax Office again to petition, requesting measures to alleviate their difficulties. The collective sentiment is described as follows:

Joint Meeting

The association convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members yesterday afternoon, inviting all members to attend. Representatives from New Citizen (新民), Huadong (華東), Zhongnan (中南), Jiangzhe (江浙), Greater Southeast (大東南), Cuizhong (萃衆), Huamei (華美), Suolun (瑣倫), Huafei (華菲), Huapin (華品), Youli (友利), Zhonghe (中和) and other factories, including Chen Qitao, Li Xuedong, Shen Yankang, Liu Jiyun, Zhang Xinliang, Shen Weiting, Sun Daosheng, Wang Xingtang, Lin Chaopin, Xu Zhongying, Xue Jiahua, Yu Banqin and others, totaling twenty-eight people, attended. After Chairman Shen Weiting paid his respects, the chairman first reported on the Beijing petition. Then, discussions began, with members expressing their opinions. All agreed that at a time when smuggled goods are rampant and raw material prices are soaring, tobacco factories are experiencing extreme difficulties in their business. Small and medium-sized tobacco factories are finding it particularly difficult to survive. Moreover, at this time of year, mold is a great concern for the factories. If taxes are increased at this time, the future of their businesses is unthinkable. After discussions, it was decided to send representatives to the Tax Office again to petition. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.

Representatives to Petition

After the meeting adjourned, Shen Weiting, Yu Banling, Wu Linzhi, Bao Gengsheng, Ge Xiongfu, Huang Ziping, Wang Ruilin, Li Xuedong, Wang Xingtang, Sun Daosheng, Peng Zizhen, Wang Weiguan, Luo Chongwei, Zhang Xinliang, Sun Lishan, Liu Jiyun, and others, totaling sixteen people, were selected as representatives and went to the Tax Office together to petition. The representatives narrated the difficulties of each tobacco factory, requesting that the tax office consider the business difficulties, approve the maintenance of the status quo, temporarily suspend the tax increase, and devise other measures to alleviate their difficulties, so as to avoid fundamental shakeups to the tobacco factories.

### Yesterday the Municipal Government Invited Various Organizations to Discuss Establishing a Crematorium

The Site Has Been Designated at Gaojing Temple, Jiangwan　Discussing Methods for Acknowledging Donations for Construction Costs

The Shanghai Municipal Government previously received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordering the establishment of crematoria in villages and towns of each province and county, stipulating public burial sites and prohibiting people from freely burying the dead, which obstructs the effective use of land to enrich people’s lives. Director Wu appointed specialists to actively prepare. Now that all plans are ready, he convened a meeting at the YMCA on Baxianqiao Road yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, hosted by Mayor Wu, inviting representatives from various native-place associations and leaders from charitable circles to discuss implementation methods. The details are recorded below:

Attending Representatives

Those who attended yesterday included Mayor Wu (represented by Li Ting’an), Wang Shunfan from the Danyang Shanghai Native-Place Association, Zhang Zipei from the Tongru Chonghaiqi Native-Place Association, Ding Ziying from the Jingjiang Public Association, Guo Juru from the Chao-Hui Association, Chen Liangyu from the Puxian Tianzhuang, Cui Yutang from the Shandong Association, Gu Zhuxuan from the Jianghuai Association, Deng Zhiyi from the Jiangning Six Counties Native-Place Association, Yu Qiaqing, Mao Heyuan, Shen Yi (represented by Dong Dayou), Wang Yiting, Wang Hanzhi, Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Xie Jiaqian, Zhu Ziqiao (represented by Guan Jiongzhi), and others, totaling more than twenty people.

Chairman’s Report

During the meeting, Director Li Ting’an of the Health Bureau, representing Mayor Wu, reported on the process of establishing the Shanghai Municipal Crematorium. He said that in the 24th year of the Republic, the Shanghai Municipal Government received an order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to require villages and towns in each province, city, and county to stipulate public burial sites, prohibiting people from freely burying the dead, which obstructs the effective use of land to enrich people’s lives. The Health, Land, and Police Bureaus were then instructed to be responsible for handling the matter. In addition to the establishment of the First Municipal Public Cemetery and the expansion of the Municipal International Cemetery by the Health Bureau, the Municipal Government is also planning to establish free public burial and crematorium sites. The Municipal Government has hired Wang Yiting, Mu Yunxuan, Zhu Ziqiao, Du Yuesheng, Qu Wenliu, Kai Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Ye Yuhu, Dun Chengen, Liu Hongsheng, Wu Liande, Hao Boyang, Wen Zongyao, Zhu Boquan, Jiang Yiping, and Li Yuanxin, and appointed Municipal Government Secretary Yu Honggou, Specialist Wang Changchun, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Police Bureau Qin Jingjun, Director of the Public Works Bureau Shen Yi, and Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting’an to organize the Shanghai Municipal Crematorium Construction Committee to carry out the work together. According to the committee's plan and research results: ㊀ The architectural style of the crematorium will adopt the domestic construction style, with a cost of 60,000 yuan (according to the design of architect Dong Dayou, 80,000 yuan is needed). ㊁ For the construction costs, in addition to the 20,000 yuan allocated by the Municipal Government and the 10,000 yuan donated by Wu Liande, it is hoped that 30,000 yuan will be raised from the charitable organizations and public associations that handle the burial of coffins. (Assuming there are a total of one hundred donating charitable organizations and public associations, then each organization should be asked to donate an average of 300 yuan. Organizations of smaller size are encouraged to contribute as much as they can, while larger organizations are encouraged to contribute more in order to raise the required amount.) Donors will enjoy preferential treatment in the future, that is, they will be able to cremate unclaimed coffins free of charge. Shanghai has limited land and a large population, with many coffins temporarily stored above ground. According to investigations by the Health Bureau and other bureaus in the 18th year of the Republic, there are already more than 100,000 such coffins. If they are buried by various charitable organizations, it is difficult to clean them up due to the limited land and large number of coffins, so they accumulate more and more, making disposal increasingly difficult. Moreover, coffins placed above ground for a long time have cracked wood and exposed corpses, emitting foul odors, which not only harms hygiene but also violates human decency. Various public associations and charity halls that store coffins for temporary placement face many procedures and large expenses to transport them back to their hometowns or find land for burial, and disputes may arise. If they support the establishment of a municipal public cemetery, they can avoid all kinds of difficulties by only spending a small amount of fuel oil, and the original houses can be converted for other self-run public welfare purposes. Moreover, cremation is a clean method of burial, which was adopted early by Buddhism. Therefore, from the perspectives of economics, humanity, hygiene, urban appearance, and the public interest of society, promoting cremation is indeed beneficial, and this city urgently needs to facilitate this for the purpose of clearing floating coffins. However, the various equipment costs are still insufficient, and we rely on enthusiastic people and public welfare charitable organizations to help us complete it. We hereby present a general outline of the preparations for your consideration.

Acknowledging Construction Costs

After the chairman finished the report, representatives expressed their opinions, all considering the establishment of the crematorium to be extremely essential. Those who confirmed their contributions on the spot included Wu Liande, 10,000 yuan; Gu Zhuxuan, 500 yuan; Mao Heyuan, 200 yuan; the Huzhou Association, 1,000 yuan; the Taizhou Public Association, 1,000 yuan; the Chao-Hui Association, 300 yuan; and the Chaozhou Association, 500 yuan. Other representatives will confirm the amounts after consulting with the directors of their organizations and report them later.

Construction to Begin Soon

The crematorium site has been designated by the city government in the southern section of the First Public Cemetery at Gaojing Temple, Jiangwan, with a total area of 20 mu. All the designs have been drafted by the Public Works Bureau and are ready. As soon as all parties have confirmed their donations, bidding will be invited and construction will begin immediately. It is expected to be completed within six months.

### Fish Market Council Responds to the Ningbo Native-Place Association

Concretely Formulating a Plan to Improve Fish Sales　Submitting It to the Ministry for Implementation After Discussion by the Council

The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry has formally responded to the Ningbo Shanghai Native-Place Association regarding the fish merchants' and fishermen's collective request for the establishment of branch markets to facilitate fish sales. The details are recorded below:

The Fish Market's Response Yesterday

Shanghai Fish Market　To the Ningbo Shanghai Native-Place Association: "We received your letters and your representatives' visits to our association to present their opinions, requesting the establishment of branch markets to alleviate merchants' difficulties. The 17th joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 24th of this month decided that the establishment of branch markets is a major issue. Given the imminent fish season, there is not enough time. Without comprehensively planning the entire project from the root, we will not be able to resolve the difficulties of all relevant parties. In accordance with the principle of not harming the market's operations or violating regulations, and ensuring that both fishmongers and fishermen benefit from the plan, we have appointed Fang Jiaobo, Gui Yanfang, and Qu Hemen. three directors, and the general and deputy managers to jointly design a plan. After formulating a concrete plan, we will submit it to the Ministry for approval and implementation. As for the promotion of fish products, we should quickly find ways to improve and increase promotional efforts, which will be planned by the market. Fishermen's representatives can directly contact the market to handle the matter. We hereby respond to your letter. Please inform us of your knowledge and transfer it accordingly."

Informing Fishermen's Representatives

After receiving the letter, the Ningbo Shanghai Native-Place Association sent separate letters to the Dinghai County Fish Association, the Shenjiamen Fish Merchants, and the Xiangshan County Fishermen's Representative Group, stating: "We received your letters requesting support for the establishment of branch markets by the Shanghai Fish Market to facilitate production and sales. We have forwarded the letters and sent Representative Mu Zixiang to the council of the market to present the actual difficulties of fish merchants and ask for their adoption of improvement measures. Now, we have received a reply from the council of the market (text recorded above). We hereby inform you and ask you to take note."

### Lawyer Jia Yi's Romantic Entanglements

Conflicting and incomplete testimonies, court debates temporarily suspend the lawsuit.

Lawyer Jia Yi, styled Yunbiao, whose office is located at Room 507, Taihe Building, Lloyd Road, Public Concession, and residence at No. 121, Lane 1492, Xin Zha Road, is currently being sued in the local court by a Wuxi woman, Zhang Suzhen (age 24, residing at No. 340, Xinjiang Road), who alleges that Jia Yi had a cohabiting relationship with her, later broke off the relationship and made a settlement agreement, promising to pay 100 yuan on January 5th and 180 yuan on February 9th, but failed to pay on time, requesting a judgment for repayment. Jia Yi claims that he was a victim of a "fairy jump" (extortion scheme), forced to sign the agreement, and that lawyer Ding Xudong was

colluding with them. He also accused Ding and Zhang Suzhen at the prosecutor's office. Yesterday, Judge Wang Kequan opened the court session. First, Zhang Suzhen appeared in court and testified that in October of last year, she entrusted Jia Yi to represent her in a divorce lawsuit from her husband. He said that if she cohabited with him, she could win the case. Therefore, the first time was in October, at night, in his office, where she had sexual intercourse with him. The second time was on November 17th, when she accompanied him to the Suzhou Higher Court for a hearing, and they also stayed overnight at the Dongwu Hotel outside the Changmen gate. On January 30th of this year, they again

stayed overnight at the Southeast Hotel room number 18 at the intersection of Chu Xiaqing Road and Baker Road, totaling three times. At this point, the judge said that this was not cohabitation, but rather "fooling around." She replied, "Because I entrusted him to fight the lawsuit, he said that only by cohabiting with him could I win." After cohabiting, Jia Yi became extremely poor and could not afford the office rent. I mistakenly believed that I would become a lawyer's wife, so I pawned jewelry and borrowed 270 yuan from him. He promised to repay it by the end of the year, but when I asked for it, he refused to return it. On January 20th, I went to ask him for the money. Because there were many people in the office, he came out with me to the Southeast Hotel and I asked him for the money. He said the money would be paid slowly,

The weather was very cold. He said, "Let's sleep for a while first." I refused. He pulled me to sleep for more than a quarter of an hour. After the deed, I asked him for money again. He said that even movie stars had to give him money, let alone a woman like you. I thought his intentions were bad, akin to a gigolo, so I wanted to go to the police station with him. Jia Yi, in a hurry, said that he would go make a phone call and ask someone to mediate. When Jia went to make the phone call, he only had a fur coat on, without pants underneath. After five minutes, lawyer Ding Xudong and Mr. Du came. At that time, they mediated. Jia paid me 300 yuan at the time. I did not agree. Lawyer Ding said that he was a

lawyer, guaranteeing it would not fall through. So, at that time, I took 20 yuan first, and the rest was written as two promissory notes. After writing them, Ding and the others left. Jia and I also parted very politely. Now, because Jia and Ding Xudong are shifting responsibility to each other, and not fulfilling their debt obligations, that is why I am suing, etc." At this point, the judge asked Ding Xudong to testify. He said, "I am 41 years old, a lawyer, residing at No. 16, Tongan Fang, Xinnao Bridge Road. I have no relationship with Zhang Suzhen. Jia Yi is a colleague. On January 30th, I was having dinner with Jia Yi's classmate, Du Ernan, when I received a phone call from Jia Yi, saying that it was about a romantic entanglement and asked

me to go there. I went to the Southeast Hotel with Du, walked into a very small room (worth about forty or fifty cents), and saw Jia Yi. He kept saying that he was ashamed. At that time, Zhang Suzhen was sitting on the edge of the bed, and Jia Yi was sitting in the middle of the bed. Both of them told me what had happened. Because it was very disreputable and immoral for the legal profession, I advised them to reconcile, write an agreement to end the cohabitation relationship, and give her 280 yuan, to be paid back in two installments. At that time, I advanced 20 yuan. The note was carefully read by Jia Yi, and he even added the words "forever" himself. The note was written by Du."

After the matter was over, they dispersed. At this point, Jia Yi said, "First, how could the office be a place for adultery? Second, when going to Suzhou for the hearing, my wife went with me. After the hearing, Zhang returned to Shanghai first. As for the woman who stayed overnight at the Dongwu Hotel, it was my own wife. As for the Southeast Hotel, they opened the room and asked me to go there. I did not call Ding Xudong, it was completely their collusion to extort money," etc. At this point, the judge ruled that the settlement agreement was currently being investigated by the prosecutor's office and could not be retrieved, so the case was temporarily suspended. The case will be heard again after the investigation is completed and the documents are retrieved.

### Doubts Surrounding Suicide of Baoweituan Member Lu Xiaodi

How could a bullet enter from the rear? The caliber of the bullet is also highly suspicious.

Lu Xiaodi, a local member of the Pusong District Baoweituan, aged 23, lived with his brother Lu Shukang (aged 28) and Xiaodi's child bride Lu Siju (aged 19) at No. 13, Gong's Residence, Zhoujia Bridge, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai. At around 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, Lu Xiaodi suddenly committed suicide with a rifle used by the Baoweituan. Afterwards, Lu Shukang immediately took him by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment, but because the injury was internal and could not be treated, he soon died. The Zaojiadu Police Sub-bureau in charge of the area, upon hearing the news, immediately sent police officers to investigate and reported to the local court for an autopsy. On the morning of the day, the court sent Prosecutor Wang, along with a clerk and forensic doctor, to the scene. The autopsy revealed that the deceased Lu Xiaodi had been shot in the buttocks, the bullet entering and exiting through the abdomen. Prosecutor Wang believed that it was already suspicious to commit suicide with a heavy rifle. Moreover, the bullet entered from the rear, making the doubts even greater. He ordered the police bureau to send detectives to investigate. The bureau, upon receiving the order, immediately sent detectives Han Yushan and Yang Yucai. They found that Lu Xiaodi had committed suicide in bed. After the bullet exited the abdomen, it also shot through the bedding and penetrated the soil. Han and others excavated the soil and retrieved the bullet. It is reported that the caliber of the bullet seemed to be different from that used by the rifle. At the same time, it was found that the rifle barrel was rusty, and the bullet was definitely not fired from that rifle. They then arrested and brought to the bureau the deceased's brother Lu Shukang, child bride Lu Siju, and Lu Chenshi, who lived with them, for questioning. After a brief interrogation, they prepared a document and transferred them to the General Bureau for the court to propose an investigation.

### Brief Report on Shipping Information

The State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Beiyang liner "Xinfeng" diverted to the Yangtze River for the first time. At around 9 p.m. on the 24th, when the ship arrived at Liuhaisha above Tongzhou, it encountered a severe wind and snowstorm, resulting in grounding. The hull was stuck in the sand and could not be freed. Shipowner Yang urgently telegraphed Shanghai for help. Yesterday morning (the 26th), the bureau telegraphed the company's upstream steamer "Jiangxin" to the rescue. It is estimated that it will be possible to tow it out only during high tide today. It is found that the "Xinfeng" is fully loaded with outgoing goods and also has several hundred passengers. If it cannot be towed out in time, the passengers will first be transferred to the upstream steamer, it is said.

The Shou Kang Shipping Company's Ke Chang An ship encountered danger and lost its rudder 140 nautical miles north of Sheshan. Yesterday, a telegram was received stating that the rescue ship had arrived at the location and was currently carrying out rescue operations. The cargo is guaranteed to be safe.

### Wang Fengnian Sues Mother and Brother for Living Expenses

Wang has repeatedly been involved in lawsuits with his mother and brother; the previous history needs to be investigated.

Ningbo native Wang Fengnian, a shareholder of the China Reclamation Bank and the now-defunct Yongfeng Bank, alleges that the estate left by his late father, Wang Yinting, is entirely managed by his mother, Wang Yangshi, and his younger brother, Shi Qun, etc. Since the collapse of Yongfeng Bank and due to debt relations, a large part of the estate has been seized by the Reclamation Bank and Yongfeng Bank, respectively, upon application to the court. Therefore, Fengnian has been involved in lawsuits with his mother and brother for years due to property division disputes. Recently, citing unpaid living expenses, he sued his mother, Wang Yangshi, and his brothers Wang Shijun, Wang Zhengfen, Wang Zhengxuan, Wang Zhengfang, and Wang Zhengxi at the Sixth Court of the First Special District, requesting the court to order the defendants to jointly pay 18,000 yuan for the past three years (23, 4, and 5) of annual living expenses, and to pay the share documents stipulating the 5,000 yuan due to the eldest grandson (Fengnian's son, now deceased), and to confirm that the 10,000 yuan in Wang Fengnian's account shares at the Reclamation Bank is his personal property. After a hearing was conducted, as reported in previous newspapers, Judge Luo continued the court session yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff, Wang Fengnian, testified that his family's property has not yet been divided and is still jointly owned, estimated at over 900,000 yuan. The living expenses he is requesting can be paid from this jointly owned property. As for the eldest grandson's fee, it was stipulated in the division document of the 13th year of the Republic of China, so he requested that it be awarded from January 1st of the 14th year of the Republic of China at a weekly interest rate of 8%, totaling about 10,000 yuan including the principal. The Wang Fengnian account shares were bought with my own funds and are now also seized, so he requested that the shares be confirmed as his sole property and that the proceeds from the auction can only be used to repay his outstanding debts. Only one brother, Wang Shijun, attended as the defendant. According to his testimony, all the inheritance has been fully divided and there is nothing left from which to pay the living expenses. The court considered that the circumstances of the case are quite numerous and involve previous cases, and that a thorough understanding of the entire dispute is necessary, so it decided to postpone the hearing and conduct further investigation.

### Gui Huiquin Sues Husband for Malicious Desertion

Requesting 72,000 yuan in living expenses; the judge advises them to go out and try to reconcile.

Zhang Liantang, owner of the Changping Zha Lian Electric Coal Company, previously married Gui Huiquin, a woman from Ningbo. They had a harmonious relationship for several years and had four sons and one daughter, all infants. Recently, a rift suddenly developed between the couple, making reconciliation difficult. Zhang Guishi hired lawyers Le Junfen and Le Junwei to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special District, accusing her husband of malicious abandonment and requesting 72,000 yuan in living expenses and

litigation assistance. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Li Wei of the Civil Court convened a hearing in the Civil Court No. 6. The defendant, Zhang Liantang, did not appear but appointed lawyer Zhang Shewo to defend him. The plaintiff, Zhang Guihuiquin, brought her children Zhang Chenfeng, Chengdi, Chenglong, and Chengfu to court. Zhang Guishi testified that she had been married to the defendant, Zhang Liantang, for nine years and had been living together at No. 77, Si'an Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. They have four children, the oldest being only four years old and the youngest being only one year old. In addition to opening a

Lianfeng Coal Company, the defendant also handles insurance for various Chinese and foreign insurance companies, such as Baohong, Baoshen, and Ningshao, and has set up insurance offices on the third floor of the Yongda Bank on Ningbo Road. Unexpectedly, the defendant became lustful and had an affair with a woman named Yin Xiu. Since then, he has discriminated against me and my children. Since December of last year, he has

stopped providing living expenses. I have repeatedly negotiated with him, but to no avail. On February 19th of this year, I took my children to the Lianfeng Company and demanded that the defendant provide support, but the defendant punched and beat me, causing me to fall to the ground and injure myself. A public prosecution was filed by the Gordon Road Police, and he was sentenced to a fine of 20 yuan. Now that the defendant has maliciously abandoned us for three months without giving us a penny, he is guilty of a heinous crime. I request that the defendant be ordered to

pay the plaintiff, etc., 200 yuan per month for living expenses, for a period of 30 years. Because I am extremely poor, I request litigation assistance. The defendant's lawyer, Zhang Shewo, argued that since the defendant married the plaintiff, their relationship has been harmonious. It is because the plaintiff was incited and alienated by her sisters, causing her to

quarrel with the defendant. Furthermore, the defendant resides in Zhabei, and the jurisdiction seems to be an issue. He requests that a ruling be made first. Presiding Judge Li investigated and stated that since both parties have been married for many years, they should not go to extremes and engage in endless litigation. They should know that litigation will eventually end, and since they have children, they will not be able to resolve the matter through litigation. He then declared that both lawyers should go out and try to reconcile. If reconciliation is unsuccessful, the defendant should be ordered to appear in court for another hearing.

### Economist Shōji Issues Statement on Visit to China

Shanghai, 26th (Domei News Agency): Mr. Shōji Otokichi, a member of the visiting economic survey group to China, issued a statement today in the form of a talk: (Cordial Talks Between China and Japan on the Cotton Industry) Opinions on the cotton industry were exchanged at a meeting of Chinese and Japanese representatives on the 19th and 20th of this month. The opinions of the Chinese side at that time were roughly as follows: In the past few years, China has requested various methods to strive to improve and increase cotton production. Recently, there has been significant progress in both quality and quantity. The cotton production last year was about 8 million dan, and it increased to 14 million dan last year. China will continue to work hard. In five years, in addition to supplying raw materials for its own textile industry, it can increase production by another 10 million dan. It is planned to transport this cotton to Japan. Japan imports cotton from the United States and India every year, worth about 900 million yuan. Therefore, we hope that at least half of it should be exported from China. Japan will be our largest customer in the future. We should promote the economic relations between China and Japan through cotton, which will also contribute to the adjustment of relations between the two countries. In the future, we hope that Japan will pay unreserved attention and provide sympathetic assistance to the improvement and increase of cotton production. The same hope is held for the textile industry.

The Japanese side also mentioned various opinions on this. As a result of the agreement between the two sides, China will start to improve cotton varieties and research increased production. At the same time, for the purpose of increasing the common interests of the Chinese and Japanese textile industries, they will separately elect joint representatives to establish a case, which has been decided, it is said.

### Health Bureau Handles Examination and Certification of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners

The Municipal Health Bureau has been handling the registration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners once a year since 1928. As of 1935, over 7,000 TCM practitioners have registered. According to regulations, registration should have been held in the summer of last year. However, due to the promulgation of the TCM Regulations, it should be followed. It is now learned that the bureau is complying with these conditions, formulating various individual chapters and rules, and submitting them to the municipal government for approval and implementation. It is also organizing an examination committee to handle examination and inquiry matters. All TCM practitioners who have not registered within the past year should, starting from today, fill out a resume form (obtainable from the bureau) in triplicate, four 2-inch half-length photos, a certificate fee of 5 yuan, and a stamp tax fee of 2 yuan, along with qualification certificates, and register with the bureau for examination or inquiry.

### Young Maid Obtains Freedom from Mistreatment by Mistress

Fan Jincai Escapes Life as a Maid

Ye Yuanyang, the second landlord residing at No. 26, Tianshou Lane, Keming Road, in this city, is a native of Nanhai, Guangdong, and currently works in the Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In 1934, he bought a 13-year-old girl named Fan Jincai from Nanxiang to be a maid for his use. The maid was constantly mistreated by the mistress and worked all day long, living a very hard life. Neighbors, seeing this, took pity on her and sent a letter to the Women and Children Relief Association, which forwarded it to the China Child Welfare Association for handling. The Child Welfare Association dispatched a staff member yesterday to investigate with police officer 2187 from the North Railway Station Branch. Ye's family admitted that it was true that they had bought her for 80 yuan to be a maid. It was also found that the maid's hand was severely ulcerated and wrapped in cloth. The police officer took her to the North Railway Station Branch and ordered Ye Yuanyang to come to the station for interrogation. Ye confessed that it was true that he had bought her as a maid, but he had never mistreated her. The injury on her hand was accidentally caused by a firewood knife when chopping firewood. The bureau reviewed the confession and said that even if it was not mistreatment, it was still inappropriate to conceal the registration. In addition to scolding Ye Yuanyang in person, Fan Jincai was immediately sent to the General Bureau for liberation.

### Fan Jincai

### Yao Guisheng's Case Re-heard by the Higher Third Branch Court

Yao claims he never manufactured red pills; the court ordered further investigation and trial.

Yao Guisheng, a native of Changzhou residing at No. 8, Rongsheng Lane, Annakin Road, French Concession, was arrested and sentenced for manufacturing red pills. In January 1935, Shanghai Public Security Bureau detectives arrested Huo Shouxiang, a native of Zhenjiang, in Jiumudi for selling red pills. Huo confessed that he bought the red pills from the Zhang family at No. 7, Cishou Lane, Saborse Road, French Concession, and that the boss was Yao Guisheng, etc. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau, together with the French Concession Police, first arrested Yao Guisheng and confiscated a red pill board oven at No. 7, Cishou Lane, Saborse Road. They also confiscated 4,000 red pills at No. 45, Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road. The French Concession Police sent Yao to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. As a result, Yao was sentenced to four years and four months in prison and fined 4,000 yuan. Yao did not accept the sentence and appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court, but the appeal was rejected. Yao appealed again to the Supreme Court, while Huo Shouxiang was simultaneously sent by the Public Security Bureau to the Songhu Garrison Command Military Law Office for interrogation and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Yao Guisheng's appeal case has now been dismissed by the Supreme Court, and the case has been returned to the Higher Third Branch Court for a new hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Daqi of the Higher First Branch Court visited the Criminal Court No. 2 and ordered Yao Guisheng to be brought for investigation and questioning. He also ordered Huo Shouxiang to be transferred from the Command for a face-to-face confrontation. Yao Guisheng claimed that he never manufactured red pills and that he was engaged in commerce. This case was due to a feud between my nephews Yao Fulin, Fuming, and Kang, who instigated Huo Shouxiang to frame me, etc. The judge ordered Huo Shouxiang to be brought to the court. According to Huo's confession, he bought the red pills from someone surnamed Wang. He had seen Yao Guisheng on Ximen Road before. Yao also confessed that Huo was originally a tea servant in my house, and because he committed adultery with my elder sister Yingdi, I found out and dismissed them both. Huo then asked people to borrow money from me unsuccessfully, so he held a grudge and framed me, etc. At this point, the court postponed the hearing for investigation and adjourned for another hearing. Yao and Huo were returned to custody separately.

Idle talk

### Mrs. Simpson and Mrs. Fang Danqi

— Me

The relationship between men and women is truly a cosmic mystery. What exactly does it contain? Throughout history, it has created so many romantic and tragic affairs. As the old saying goes, "It is not beauty that captivates, but oneself that is captivated." Contemporary people say, "Women are playthings for men." But are men playthings for women, or are women playthings for men? No one can offer a suitable judgment on this case. Looking at the recent love scandals in England and France, Mrs. Simpson used King Edward VIII of England as a plaything and succeeded. Mrs. Fang Danqi used Mussolini as a plaything and failed, leading to the shooting of Ambassador Chambrun. Who says women are playthings for men?

Mrs. Simpson is already past her prime, having been divorced twice. Yet, King Edward VIII cast aside his throne, willing to marry her. There are many beautiful women in the world, so why her? This is truly difficult to understand. Perhaps Edward VIII was headstrong and determined, believing that as an emperor, if he could not freely love a woman, then what was the point of having the throne? On the other hand, he was completely enveloped by Mrs. Simpson's captivating charms, so persistent that it is both difficult to accept and laugh at how women can manipulate men. Fortunately, Mrs. Simpson's divorce case has been re-examined by the London court, and the original judgment was upheld. The Duke of Windsor, the former king, will marry Mrs. Simpson after the decision. What if the London court overturns the original case? Wouldn't the Duke of Windsor be in a situation like "a hunchback falling down, unable to catch himself with his head"?

Recently, France also experienced the case of female journalist Mrs. Fang Danqi shooting the family of the former French ambassador to Italy, Chambrun. According to Fang Danqi's confession, it was because Chambrun caused her to lose the love of a certain great Italian politician, hence the shooting. This confession seems hard to believe. Mussolini is a world-renowned eccentric. Why would he fall in love with a French female journalist? Perhaps Fang Danqi had a "one-sided infatuation," which is also possible. Moreover, in Fang Danqi's residence, as many as 300 photos of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini were found, revealing the extent of her infatuation. However, when Mussolini was giving a speech to the crowd on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia, Mrs. Fang threw an orange at him. Mussolini caught the orange, waved to Mrs. Fang, and among the 300 photos, there was a large one with Mussolini's signature. These two things are also enough to prove that Mussolini and Mrs. Fang were not entirely unrelated. The length of romantic affairs can indeed weaken a hero's spirit, and this is not impossible.

But the reason why Mussolini rejected Mrs. Fang and did not approach her, was it because Chambrun leaked all of Fang Danqi's secrets, or was there another reason? Because Fang Danqi is known as a news reporter, but in reality, she is a French female spy, Chambrun would certainly not leak Fang's secret actions. Or perhaps Fang Danqi was thoroughly investigated and found to be a French spy, and this was secretly reported to Mussolini, causing Mussolini to dare not approach her, prompting Propaganda Minister Alfieri to advise her to return to her country. It is also possible. However, Mussolini's arm was almost hung by Mrs. Fang Danqi, showing that women truly have means.

But now I am investigating Fang Danqi's psychology. Did she want to be a French female spy, or did she want to be Mussolini's lover? Although I dare not make a dogmatic judgment, the psychology of women, because of the advancement of vanity and material desire, is easily dominated by the environment. In Italy, she was subdued by Mussolini's prestige, so she was willing to abandon her patriotic espionage work and wholeheartedly become Mussolini's lover, which is ultimately meaningful. Otherwise, where did the 300 photos of Mussolini come from, and why would the shooting of Chambrun occur?

### From Sailor to Financier (Part Two)

— Written by British Kezia Williams, Special Translation

This financier had set up a fully equipped chemical laboratory, and signed a contract with the government to supply everything the government wanted to know. That chemist had sent his dyeing secret formula to this chemical laboratory.

"What I want you to do," my new master, the banker, said, "is to find a way to get that formula. This was originally ours. You can explore around that chemical laboratory, or you might get some. If you need helpers, here are one hundred pounds sterling as expenses for hiring helpers."

So I found four helpers. The next day, very early, around three o'clock, a streetcar drove to the front of a wine and food store in the West End of London that was open all night and stopped. My four helpers and I jumped out of the car and went into the store to eat a rich midnight feast. At that time, my pocket contained the one hundred pounds sterling that my four helpers deserved, as well as over one hundred pounds that were my own. That chemical formula had already been obtained and was also placed in my pocket. After finishing the meal, I took out a roll of banknotes from my pocket, counted a few, paid for the meal, and put the rest back in my pocket. Then, the five of us triumphantly returned to the street. As we were walking forward, the four helpers suddenly approached me. Two of them sandwiched me in the middle, one on the left and one on the right, and the other two were in front and behind.

"Hey, hurry up and take it out!" The one on my right pointed to my pocket and ordered me like this.

I stopped. "Are you going to be rude to me?" I asked them in surprise.

"How dare we," the one behind me said, "what we want is cash."

The four of them then started fighting with me. How could I, alone, be a match for four people? All the banknotes in my pocket were robbed by them. Fortunately, that chemical formula was still in the bag. The next morning, I handed that paper to my employer. He thanked me, compensated me for the lost money, and praised me, saying that I was exactly the person he wanted to hire.

"Thank you," I replied, "but this kind of profession is not what I want to do. I would rather get a banking job."

A week later, I took a boat to the West Indies and started my series of adventures, which not only made me rich but also made everyone associated with me successful. It was an agricultural business, with cocoa as the main product.

This brief record of my early ups and downs may be useful for unemployed youths and those whose occupations do not suit them and who want to seek better jobs. After reading it, they may say: "This is indeed very good, but Kezia Williams encountered various opportunities, but I have never encountered any."

My answer is, "If Kezia Williams had not looked for opportunities himself, he would never have encountered opportunities, whether good or bad."

The root of the problem for those who cannot get the jobs they want or the money they want lies in a purely lack of education. But the education I am talking about is not going to school. My own school life ended very early. The first thing I did after running away from the classroom was to correct the mistakes I had made in the classroom, so I engaged in educating myself.

If you have not gotten a job, it is the legacy of a bad education system. Those government officials responsible for training you either did not pay attention to your future prospects or were mediocre and lacked foresight. Complaining about the mistakes that have been made is of no use now. What you should do is to seek the best use from an unglamorous profession. If you can correct the shortcomings, then your children will not repeat your mistakes.

Never envy those who get jobs by "influence." If they think they have nothing to fear and do not seek self-reliance, then that "influence" will surely lead them to failure. Rely on your own talents, and that talent will be foolproof.

This article can be used as medicine for today's generally depressed youth, especially the last few sections, which are indeed golden words. Although the translator is an incompetent and uneducated person, I would like to add a few sentences based on my personal experience. The translator joined the newspaper industry thirty years ago, taking on translation work. Although I had studied for several years, my formal school life was only two full years. At that time, my Chinese was only fluent, and my English was only a rough understanding of grammar. Even a short piece of news felt like it was full of unfamiliar words. So I used the dictionary as my teacher, and in less than three to five years, I had worn out two or three dictionaries. But later, I gradually distanced myself from this teacher. The dictionary I use now, although it has been used for more than ten years, maybe the binding is stronger than before, so it is still intact, and even the corners of the book have not been curled up. In the beginning, I carefully compared the translations published in other newspapers with what I translated every day, looking for my own mistakes. After a few years, I, like a toddler learning to walk, have grown up and have strong feet. I can run fast at will, so I also took on a slightly more complicated job. Today, I am able to provide a comfortable life for a family of more than ten, and sometimes I barely have the remaining strength to help poor relatives and friends. This is entirely the effect of educating myself and gaining experience.

I often think that without experiencing storms and waves, one cannot become an experienced sailor, and without experiencing gunfire, one cannot become a strong soldier in battle. Kezia Williams became a financier from a sailor, and the strength lies entirely in experiencing many dangers and gaining great experience. Furthermore, in my personal case, since entering society and getting a job, I had smooth sailing for more than ten years, without any twists and turns. Unexpectedly, I mistakenly believed in the words of a friend and engaged in business, losing all my savings of more than ten years and even incurring some debts, which was suffering from a lack of business experience. Therefore, I advise young people to follow what Kezia Williams said, "Seek the best use from an unglamorous profession," which is to seek experience. When your experience is rich, your position will naturally improve. Never try to do things without experience. The text is too long, let's talk about it another day if there is a chance.

### Sai Jinhua (9)

— Chen He

In the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu, the Qing court's oppression of the people reached its extreme. The heavy taxes were exploited layer by layer. Although the people suffered unspeakable hardships, they did not dare to oppose the so-called holy dynasty of the Qing court. On the other hand, the aggressive flames of the powers were increasingly aggravated with the faintness of the Qing court. Therefore, the people shifted their anger to foreigners. If you want to defeat foreigners, you must first defeat the weapons of foreigners; there is the whimsical Boxer Rebellion, a superstition that can not be penetrated by guns and cannons. The blind followers who lack scientific knowledge are prevalent in the Boxer Rebellion, thinking that they can really resist foreign guns and cannons.

### The Words of a Cup

— Jianying

I remembered my birthday, and I would associate it with the cup that has been closely following the master like a loyal servant for more than ten years, listening to the master's instructions. For a period of time, its sweet potato-like figure had been rejected by me. I once had the same determination as a shrew to abandon her own child, to abandon my cup that seemed to be placed on the table every day and kissed several times a day! But now, it has gradually become closer to me again. I don't think its figure is ugly. On the contrary, I think its sweet potato-like figure is the most natural and pleasing form!

I cannot say why it is so cherished: when my thoughts leave the workplace and play in the free grassland, when my fingers leave the pen that has provided me with food for many years and idle in the misty plains, I am accompanied by it, whether it gives me plain boiled water, black tea, or green tea, or even coffee and milk; I don't think it treats me harshly, how about it's said it is luxury? I feel that it supplies me so naturally, just in time, everything is what I like!

You ugly face,

But in your heart is my real friend,

You will not be hypocritical,

Because your belly,

Is my face.

I use this unsightly poem to sing about my cup, which is the swan song of my unchanging thoughts for more than ten years; when I was in the northern part of the border, I fell ill, so it was imprisoned in my box with a broken button ring, and no one else paid attention to it. When I could not sit down quietly in the bedroom, when my heart was like a time when a venomous snake was biting on the street, it was abandoned on the table, letting the dust fill its belly. When the first sound of the north wind told me that winter was coming, other people's homes were equipped with stoves and added coal, spending the spring in winter. However, the fate of my cup was bitter—it was simply too miserable! It let the ice cubes like lumps grow on people's bodies as tightly as possible in the belly of the cup, ah, ah, when I think of this, I am simply going to faint with sadness, ... it was in that year when the ice cubes froze in his belly, its body was damaged by a pot of boiling water, and a very thin stripe cracked, although the stripe was not very clear to my eyes, however, when I needed a drink to quench my thirst, when I poured water from the thermos into my cup with a thin stripe, I heard the sound of "sasa——", I felt like I heard an old friend making a farewell to the world in bed, both miserable and embarrassing.

However, the cry that seemed to be a farewell to the world in bed has passed for three years now, three years! This is such a long time, and it can actually live a lingering life, which I cannot but say is a prayerful joy! But, at this moment, the most unfortunate sound has finally been made, when I pick up the kettle to pour water, the injured stripe is gradually cracking before my eyes.

Ah! It can no longer supply me, my friend who has shared weal and woe, it will finally find the quiet earth it needs to rest in... Ah, everything in the world, many of you are going to be exploited by the two words "old age", old age has stripped away your pride, glory, courage, and endurance, and also stripped away flesh, blood and life...

I sobbed, I cried for the love of more than ten years; now it has become waste, it is still placed on my desk, but it is useless, it is like a miniature coffin, every day when I work to the point of fatigue, I look at my cup that has become waste on my desk, and it seems like someone is whispering in my ear: "Hurry up and work, everything will be unrewarding when you are old"! So, urge me to keep moving forward!
