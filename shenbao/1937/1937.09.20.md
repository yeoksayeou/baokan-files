### Entire Front Quiet with Only Minor Contact

Enemy Suffered Over 10,000 Deaths in Three General Offensives; Our Second Counterattack at Yong'an Bridge Victorious; We Maintain Original Line and Remain in Superior Position

Over the past week, the enemy has exerted all its strength, issuing orders for a full-line general offensive. Our loyal and brave soldiers on all fronts met them head-on, inflicting over 10,000 enemy deaths. Morale was greatly diminished, and the extent of the damage was unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battles. Currently, the enemy appears to be actively reorganizing its remaining forces and mobilizing reinforcements, attempting a final struggle. Our army is also committed to a calm and steadfast defense, adhering to the principle of waiting for the enemy to exhaust themselves. Therefore, yesterday, the entire front was relatively quiet with only minor contact. Small enemy units continuously harassed our positions, but were repeatedly repelled by our forces. These actions were likely reconnaissance in nature and unrelated to the overall battle situation. Yesterday at 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM, our forces launched a second counterattack on the enemy's Yong'an Bridge position. Our artillery units provided support, and the enemy, caught off guard, retreated after being unable to withstand the assault. A considerable amount of baggage and supplies were seized. Shortly thereafter, we returned to our original defensive positions. In the Luodian and Liuhang areas, our front line remained completely unchanged. In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, sporadic machine gun and rifle fire occurred, becoming more intense after 1:00 AM this morning. We firmly hold our original positions and maintain a superior advantage. It is anticipated that in the coming days, the enemy will once again use all its naval, land, and air forces to attack our Luodian and Liuhang lines. We are conserving our strength and are determined to engage the stubborn enemy in a decisive battle again.

Over the past week, there have been no major changes on either side of the front line. The enemy is currently focusing all its efforts on attacking Luodian and Liuhang. Since the fall of Luodian, our forces in that area are now holding positions in areas such as Wudoujing, Nanbeitang, and Beizhudian, engaging the enemy in a stalemate. The enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses in recent days. East of Liuhang, our forces are holding Chaowang Temple and Jinjiawan. North of Gujiazhai, our forces are in Yangmuqiao East and Luzhai. The enemy has occupied Yong'an Bridge. Yesterday afternoon, our forces launched a counterattack against the enemy in Yanghang. Although the enemy resisted stubbornly, we advanced to Yong'an Bridge. This location has been the site of the most intense enemy attacks since our forces shifted their lines on the 13th of this month. In the northern Jiangwan area, our forces are defending the line of Yanjiawan (along the Yunzaobing), Lujiaqiao Village, Lingnan School, and Ye's Garden. Both sides have built deep trenches and high ramparts, and there have been no major battles in recent days. Only daily exchanges of gunfire between sentries have occurred. The enemy forces in that area are all Northeastern compatriots who were coerced into service and belong to the units of traitors Zhang Haipeng and Li Shouxin. It is believed that if given the opportunity, they would defect and return to our side. According to a staff officer of the XXXXXX unit, the reason our forces have not completely eliminated the enemy in the past month is due to the enemy's reliance on naval gunnery and aerial bombardment, which caused us some casualties. Since moving to the new front lines, we have installed anti-aircraft machine guns and cannons in various locations. As soon as enemy aircraft are spotted, they are engaged. Therefore, in recent days, very few enemy aircraft have flown over our positions. Those that do occasionally fly over hover at high altitudes. They are not as brazen as before, which shows that they are timid and dare not attempt anything rash.

### The Enemy's Third Major Defeat Since the Outbreak of the Shanghai Battle

The Enemy Gambled Everything on the Eve of the September 18th Incident; Repeatedly Suffered Heavy Losses, Morale is Low, Awaiting Reinforcements

Central News Agency reports that the focus of the fighting in recent days has been on the Luodian line. After suffering setbacks in Hongkou and Yangshupu, the enemy resorted to the old "January 28th Incident" strategy, placing its main force to land at Liuhe, hoping to threaten our flank and rear. Unexpectedly, in the Battle of Luodian, they were almost completely annihilated by our forces and had to seek reinforcements from their homeland. Since the first of this month, they have once again brought their elite naval, land, and air forces, as well as mechanized units, to forcibly land at Wusong and attack our positions near Beisitang and Yanghang. Our troops fought bravely and killed many enemy soldiers. In order to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop, our forces gradually lured the enemy deeper into our territory. The enemy, believing victory was within their grasp, recklessly advanced rashly. Fierce battles have raged near Yong'an Bridge and Yangmuqiao in recent days. On the 17th, the enemy spared no effort, committing all its elite forces in a desperate gamble, hoping to have a decisive battle with us on the eve of the "September 18th Incident." However, our forces had already seen through their plot. Our frontline soldiers, loyal and brave for the country, spared no effort, sacrificing themselves and fighting as one against a hundred, giving the enemy a head-on blow. After several charges, the enemy was completely annihilated in front of our positions. This marks the enemy's third major defeat since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. The enemy has repeatedly suffered heavy losses, its morale is low, and it dares not advance rashly, waiting for reinforcements and resupply.

### Detailed Account of the Fierce Battles in the Yanghang, Yuepu, and Luodian Areas in Recent Days

Talk by a Senior Military Officer

A reporter from the Central News Agency inspected the Shanghai front on September 18th and met with a senior military officer who provided a detailed account of the recent fierce battles in the Yanghang, Yuepu, and Luodian areas. The details are as follows:

On the 12th of this month, the enemy's 3rd, 6th, 11th, 12th, 16th, and newly added 9th Divisions, utilizing their superior naval and air forces, launched the third phase of their general offensive against us. Their main force attacked the center of our positions from Yanghang and Yuepu, along both sides of the Douliu-Douluo Highway, attempting to cut off the Shanghai-Taicang Highway before September 18th, consolidate Wusong and Shanghai, and use a portion of their forces to break through our encirclement of Luodian from the Luodian and Xiaochuansha areas.

On the 13th and 14th, fierce battles of attrition were fought with our forces in places such as Gujia Pavilion, Xujia Pavilion, and Yong'an Bridge. Our soldiers are resolved to live and die with their positions. When the enemy infantry approached, they were met with counterattacks, killing many enemy soldiers. Corpses littered the field, and their attack made no progress. This was the enemy's first setback. After dusk on the 14th, taking advantage of the enemy's fatigue, we launched a full-line counterattack. The fighting was especially fierce in the Luodian area. The enemy troops in areas such as Changqiao, Liuweiqiao, Panjiaqiao Station were all defeated by our forces. The waters of the Jiejing River were stained red. Luodian was completely burned down. We captured an enemy regimental flag from the 22nd Regiment and seized many important military orders and documents. According to a diary of a certain officer, in ten days of fierce fighting, each company suffered more than half casualties.

On the 16th, the enemy reorganized its remaining forces, using the Taiwan Garrison to reinforce Luodian and launch another attack. Due to cloudy, foggy weather and heavy rain, the enemy air force lost its effectiveness. Our army's morale soared, and we often used our main force to launch counterattacks from the front. Fierce battles were fought with the enemy in the areas of Nanbeitangkou, Dongjiang, Xijiang, and Luodian. Because our infantry and artillery coordination was effective, and the mortars had a great effect, about a regiment of the enemy attacking our Zhangjiayan collapsed immediately. At the same time, our anti-aircraft guns in Jiading and in front of our positions in Jinjiawan shot down an enemy bomber each. The enemy suffered extremely heavy deaths on this day. This was the enemy's second setback.

On the 17th, the enemy added one of its newly arrived divisions to the Yanghang front and launched a final general offensive, recklessly attacking our positions repeatedly with dense formations. We used machine guns to mow them down, killing countless enemy soldiers. Our positions remained unshaken. At this time, our fresh troops arrived and immediately joined the counterattack from the areas of Yangmuqiao, Jinjiazhai, and Beizhuqiao, sweeping the enemy. By 12:00 PM, the enemy was completely routed. Since the morning of the 18th, the enemy has retreated completely. The corpses of the enemy are scattered everywhere in the Yanghang, Yong'an Bridge, and Jinjiawan areas, covering an area of more than ten miles. The scene of their utter defeat can be imagined. It is estimated that in six days of fierce fighting with the enemy, we have killed tens of thousands of enemy soldiers. This is the detailed account of the enemy's disastrous defeat in the third phase of their general offensive. The enemy, with their arrogance, no longer has the ability to attack again.

### Our Air Force Raids the Enemy, Inflicting Great Damage

Western Newspapers Report the Facts of the Damage; Shanghai Textile Company Also Bombed

The North China Daily News reports that from 6:50 PM to 9:00 PM and again from 11:00 PM to after midnight on the 18th, Shanghai experienced an unprecedented aerial bombardment in its history. Chinese planes dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on the Yangshupu, Hongkou, and Broadway areas, causing fires in several locations. The planes swooped down from the clear moonlit sky and dropped bombs at low altitudes, showing unprecedented bravery. At that time, there were as many as nine fires. A bomb struck the Shanghai Textile Company, which is run by the Japanese, causing a fierce fire. According to the Ta Kung Pao, the Shanghai Textile Mill is one of the largest Japanese-owned textile mills in China. The Japanese are now using it as a military concentration point. The extent of the damage inside the factory is unknown. A spinning room at the Ewo Mill also caught fire after being hit by a bomb, but it was extinguished by Indian guards. According to the Shanghai Times, during the Chinese air raid on Yangshupu and other places on the evening of the 18th, a bomb hit a Japanese gunboat. The Japanese military positions in Yangshupu also suffered heavy damage.

Central News Agency reports that our air force raided enemy ships in Shanghai last night and bombed enemy military positions. In addition to hitting one enemy ship (another ship was hit by artillery shells) and destroying a large quantity of enemy military supplies, it was also learned that many enemy military vehicles, tanks, and armored vehicles were parked on vacant lots on East Xihua Road and Zhaofeng Road, which were also destroyed by our forces.

### Detailed Account of the Enemy's Disastrous Defeat in Liuhang

Remaining Enemy Forces at Yangmuqiao Completely Defeated; Enemy Corpses Pile Up Along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway

The battle report from Liuhang was received yesterday and is as follows: (1) On the 17th, three enemy regiments launched a fierce artillery bombardment on our line from Yangmuqiao to Chaowang Temple, east of Liujiaxing. From afternoon to dusk, a portion of the enemy infantry advanced towards our positions. Our forces immediately retaliated, launching a counterattack charge, engaging in melee combat several times. After fierce fighting until about 10:00 PM that night, the enemy forces were finally completely defeated. Enemy corpses were piled up like mountains along both sides of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. The enemy in the Xiaozhuzhai area was subjected to concentrated artillery fire and heavy bombardment, suffering extremely heavy losses. From the evening of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the front lines fell silent, indicating that the enemy's offensive operations had completely failed. (2) An enemy lieutenant colonel was killed by our forces in Liujiaxing on the evening of the 17th. An examination of the insignia found on his body revealed that he belonged to the 34th Regiment of the Hiroshima 5th Division. A review of the entries in his diary revealed that the unit arrived at the mouth of the Yangtze River on the 1st of this month, landed on the 5th, rested in Wusong on the 6th, and did not advance towards Yanghang and Liuhang until the 9th. (3) The largest number of enemy soldiers were killed and wounded along the highway near Yangmuqiao and in the vicinity of Jinjiawan, approximately more than one thousand. A large quantity of weapons and materials were also abandoned.

### Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Pudong and Other Areas

At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning (the 19th), more than a dozen enemy planes flew from the northeast, circling over Pudong for a long time to conduct reconnaissance. They also fired indiscriminately with machine guns. They then dispersed to Zhabei, West Shanghai, South Shanghai, Longhua, and other areas to conduct reconnaissance before leaving at around 9:00 AM.

Pudong

More than thirty enemy planes flew to the Pudong area from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM yesterday morning, indiscriminately bombing. However, the victims were civilians. Almost half of the houses in Yangjing Town and Qichangzhan in Pudong were destroyed. Because the area had become a war zone, most of the residents had already fled, so there were few casualties. However, a small squadron of enemy planes fired machine guns and dropped bombs in the Nanmatou, Dongjiadu, and Yangjiadu areas. Many civilian houses in the Pudong Xinmalu area were destroyed. There were many villagers in the rear of each of these areas, and it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, so there were more pedestrians than usual. It is estimated that there were more than a dozen injured, but fortunately there were no deaths.

Minhang

Minhang Town, which belongs to Shanghai County, is the largest town in the county. There is a wharf along the Huangpu River, which is the most prosperous area of the county. The most valuable area, the old street and front street, was bombed four times and is now completely rubble. Yesterday morning, enemy planes bombed the market tail of Minhang Town and the Zhugang area. As a result, the only undamaged and habitable areas in Minhang are in the more remote countryside.

Nanxiang

In the Nanxiang area, enemy planes have bombed Xianghuaqiao and South Street, the most prosperous areas, six times, reducing them to scorched earth. However, the house of a certain Mr. Fang, a wanted traitor in Xianghuaqiao, suffered no damage, and the wireless telegraph wires were not damaged either.

### Front Lines Quiet in Zhabei Area

Central News Agency reports that the front lines in the Zhabei and Jiangwan Road areas were very quiet yesterday. Aside from occasional minor contact, there were no major battles all day.

The enemy in the Jiangwan area has been reinforced with newly arrived troops. Since the 17th, the enemy has been holed up in trenches, not daring to venture out. Therefore, the entire front has been quiet. At 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, the enemy suddenly launched a heavy artillery barrage on our positions at the North Station, the May 30th Cemetery, and Chi Chih University, which lasted until 6:30 AM. Our fortifications are solid, and there was no damage. In the area north of Sanmin Road, including Lijiaqiao and Sijing Ball Field, more than 300 enemy soldiers advanced towards our positions. They were met with a head-on interception and were repelled.

### Puppet Organization in Baoshan City

Yesterday, the various lines in Shanghai were quiet, and there were no fierce battles. Enemy troops attacked Liuhang in the early morning, and there was a dense sound of gunfire and artillery, but it stopped after half an hour. In the Baziqiao and Shuidian Road areas of Zhabei, the enemy used mortars as cover and launched attacks on our positions in batches. After our troops swept them with machine guns, they retreated in disarray. It has been learned that the enemy, in order to exploit traitors to facilitate deception, has organized a local maintenance association in Baoshan City. The association's headquarters is located in the City God Temple. It is said that it is organized by more than 30 traitors, including He Meisheng and Wang Zhengcai, who have boldly appeared as puppets and issued announcements to reassure the people, full of ridiculous and shameless statements. Fortunately, the residents of the area have long since fled, leaving only a small number of elderly, weak, and disabled people.

### Enemy Ships Continue to Transport Military Supplies to Shanghai

This morning (the 19th), before dawn, two more enemy transport ships, the Shanghai Maru and the Kasagi Maru, sailed into Shanghai and berthed at the Wayside Wharf to unload military supplies, which was a busy operation. The Liangyou Maru, the Jida Maru, the Fifth Unkai Maru, and another unnamed transport ship that had previously sailed into Shanghai remain berthed outside the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf and the Huangpu Wharf and have not yet sailed out. Currently, the warehouses at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha Wharf, the Huangpu China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf, the Central Wharf, and the Wayside Wharf are all filled with enemy military supplies and materiel.

### Twenty-Five Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River Yesterday

Central News Agency reports that after our air force launched several night raids the night before last, the enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River mostly fled downstream towards Yangshupu and other areas. Only yesterday afternoon did a portion of them gradually return to the inner harbor. According to an investigation conducted by reporters yesterday afternoon, the situation of enemy ships berthing is as follows: One destroyer at the Japan Mail Line Wharf No. 11, one Liangyou Maru and one unnamed transport ship at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf, one Shanghai Maru and one Kasagi Maru at the Wayside Wharf, one Jida Maru and one Fifth Unkai Maru at the Huangpu Wharf, and destroyers No. 38, 21, 17, 15, 13, and 1, gunboats No. 31, 27, 24, 22, 28, 6, 14, and 13, and two gunboats No. 11 at floating docks, one gunboat at the New Mitsui Wharf, and one flagship Izumo at floating dock No. 2. In total, there are 11 gunboats, 7 destroyers, 6 transport ships, and 1 flagship Izumo, for a total of 25 ships.

### Inside Story of the Tokyo Coup

Ugaaki Resigned as General; Young Officers Believe It Was an Act of Defiance Against the Emperor

Tokyo Dispatch: Although the authorities here have not explicitly announced the so-called Tokyo coup, its contents have been leaked, but not in detail. The assassinated general is General Ugaaki. When Ugaaki formed his cabinet last year, the military, because of his relationship with financial groups and different factions, did everything possible to block him. After failing, Ugaaki, in resentment, resigned his general's title as well, meaning, "Since I am not qualified to form a cabinet, I naturally cannot be a general either." Generals must command the three armed forces during wartime. Ugaaki knew that there was a lack of talented generals in the Japanese army. Logically, if something happened in the future, the military would use me as the main general. Therefore, he specifically resigned as general to show his resistance. And during this Shanghai battle, the naval landing force failed. When they planned to send the army, there was no suitable main general for a time. The military secretly probed Ugaaki's intentions, wanting him to come forward. Ugaaki refused, and was quite firm. The military then used Matsui to perfunctorily handle the war. On the other hand, the young officers were greatly angered by Ugaaki, saying that the general's title was granted by the Emperor, and was different from a scholar's degree. How could it be resigned? Resigning as general was defying the Emperor. Their motive for harming Ugaaki was precisely this.

### Talk by Former Ambassador to the United States Shih Chao-chi

Enemy Military Atrocities Should Be Suppressed by International Action; The Extent to Which Countries Are Indulging Japan Is Cause for Concern; Our Relationship with the United States Is Close and We Have Higher Expectations

Central News Agency reports that Dr. Shih Chao-chi, the former ambassador to the United States, has been residing in Shanghai since he left his post. Yesterday (the 19th), he made a statement to reporters, saying, "I am very pleased with the spirit of unity and common hatred of the enemy among our people in the face of the violent Japanese invasion. The editorials in the European and American newspapers in Shanghai have all consistently condemned Japan's aggression and methods of warfare. The friendly nations' public opinion has expressed deep sympathy for us, and I am also greatly moved. As for Japan's violation of all international laws that have been recognized as 'civilized' by countries around the world, such as the slaughter of non-combatants, hospital patients, and Red Cross members, the facts are all there, and there is no need to say more. If such brutal acts by the Japanese are not suppressed by international action, there will be a reaction in the future, or even in the near future. Indeed, this civilized world cannot disregard its obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. They must rise up and stop Japan's aggression, because Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931 has already plunged the world into chaos." Referring to the Shanghai battle situation, Shih said, "Our troops are fighting bravely and their morale is extremely high, because they understand that they are fighting for justice, culture, and the defense of their country, so as to avoid invasion and trampling. Our soldiers and civilians, whether at home or abroad, are determined to continue to resist to the end. In fact, all unprecedented disasters and bloodshed can often be alleviated or avoided through appropriate international action. Whenever I think of this, I remember something that happened in Tianjin decades ago, when the American naval commander Yingjiaoyu helped the British naval commander in his time of need. This happened in 1859. At that time, British fleet commander Admiral Hope was seriously injured, and many of his troops were killed or wounded. Commander Darnell of the American warship Powhatan immediately visited the commander to express his condolences. On the way, several British sailors were sailing in small boats, and when they attempted to rescue British sailors on the beach, they were blocked by the receding tide. When the American commander saw this, he ordered several of his shallow-draft ships to rush to their aid, saying, 'Blood is heavier than water.' At that time, although Commander Darnell's actions technically violated his 'neutral' status, and diplomatic circles considered the matter complicated, this righteous act by the American commander quickly won the sympathy of all parties in the world. The American commander believed that humanitarianism was more important than diplomatic considerations. This wise judgment was considered reasonable by people of all countries. Commander Darnell's words and deeds not only deeply moved the British and Americans at the time, but are still praised to this day. Because of this, the extent to which the countries of the world will turn a blind eye to Japan's aggression is truly cause for doubt. Regarding current Sino-American relations, Shih said that because he is a former ambassador to the United States and has now returned after leaving his post, he does not want to say too much, but he said that the Chinese people have had contact with the United States earlier, so they have higher expectations for the United States than for other countries. This feeling has a historical basis. Even before the United States declared its independence, the two countries had close trade relations. In the early days of Sino-American trade, it was of great benefit to the then fledgling American economy. Later, in the first half of the last century, the development of American shipping and Sino-American trade benefited the development of the United States along the Pacific coast. American missionaries arrived in Guangzhou at about the same time as American merchant ships. American personnel have always been in leading positions in education, hospitals, and charitable undertakings. After the World War, when the Washington Conference was held, the United States resolutely advocated the adoption of new measures in the East. As a result, the Nine-Power Treaty was signed. The signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty almost included all the Pacific countries related to the current Sino-Japanese dispute. Shih concluded that the treaty also contained provisions to deal with the current dispute.

### The Comforting Association Calls on All Sectors Not to Send Comforting Items Directly to the Front

The Situation of Entering and Exiting Gunfire Is Dangerous; There Are Also Fears That Traitors May Be Mixed In, Resulting in the Leakage of Military Secrets

Central News Agency reports that recently, all sectors have been sending comforting items directly to the front, which is certainly commendable, but the situation of entering and exiting gunfire is extremely dangerous, and it is inevitable that villains will be mixed in, resulting in the leakage of military secrets. A certain headquarters yesterday sent a special letter to the Shanghai Municipal Comforting Committee, stating, "The war zone is heavily guarded, and the enemy's bombing is becoming more frequent. There are also fears that traitors may use the pretext of comforting to enter the positions, endangering the entire battle situation. In order to protect the safety of the enthusiastic groups or individuals from all walks of life who love the frontline soldiers, we specially request your committee to immediately notify the public in Shanghai that in the future, all comforting items should be sent to your committee for forwarding, so as to unify and avoid danger." The committee yesterday sent separate letters to relevant groups, advising them not to send items directly to the front, but to hand them over to the Comforting Committee for forwarding.

### Fifteen of Our Merchant Ships Have Been Detained by the Enemy

Crew Members Are Being Sent Back to the Country in Succession

Continental Daily reports that according to news from the shipping industry and the naval circles in this port, all Chinese ships chartered by Japanese merchants have been detained in Japan. It is said that this move is in retaliation for the Chinese army's sinking of several Japanese Kiyokawa Company ships when it blockaded the river in Shanghai's Nanshi and Zhenjiang. It is estimated that there are a total of fifteen Chinese ships in Japan, and their crew members will be sent back to Hong Kong, Qingdao, and Tianjin in succession.

### British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Will Undergo Nautical Therapy

His Injuries Have Largely Healed and He Will Be Discharged from the Hospital Soon; One Account States That He Plans to Stay in India for a Short Time for Therapy

New News Agency reports that British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's injuries have improved rapidly in the past week. The effects of the gunshot wounds he sustained on his body have completely recovered. According to British sources, Knatchbull-Hugessen has decided to leave the Country Hospital soon and will be accompanied by his wife on a warship for nautical therapy in order to use the ocean air to recover quickly. The period will be approximately two months. One account states that Knatchbull-Hugessen plans to stay in India for a short time for therapy after he is discharged from the hospital.

### Urgent Telegrams Accepted and Sent as Usual by Telegraph Offices

The Ministry of Communications' regulations on restricting the use of codes for private domestic telegrams have been detailed in this newspaper. The Ministry has now further ordered telegraph offices in all localities to accept and send urgent telegrams as usual, with the exception of the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, in order to facilitate communication.

### American Warship Carries Large Batch of Mail to the United States

The American destroyer Ballard sailed to Hong Kong yesterday morning (the 18th) carrying a large batch of mail to the United States, and also carried American僑 to the United States in Fuzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen. The American transport ship Altair will arrive in Shanghai on the 28th of this month.

### Pawnbrokers Association Letter to Fellow Businesses Soliciting Cotton Quilts

To Transport to the Front Lines for Soldiers' Use

The Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association has specially issued an official letter to all pawnbrokers yesterday regarding the solicitation of bedding to be transported to the front lines for soldiers' use. The letter reads as follows: "To whom it may concern, we have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which forwarded a letter from the Shanghai Comfort Committee, stating that the secretariat of the All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association has approved a letter from He Mingjun of the pawnbroking industry. The letter stated, 'Having recently read reports that cotton quilts are urgently needed at the front lines, according to a military officer, the weather is now cold, especially at night, and cotton quilts are essential for keeping warm. When wounded soldiers are transferred to the rear, the journey takes time, and exposure to wind and cold will make treatment even more difficult. My humble opinion is to collect cotton quilts and entrust them to the Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association, the Beishi Pawnbrokers Office, and the Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association, to donate expired cotton quilts from various pawnshops to the front lines. Within a few days, two to three thousand cotton quilts can be easily collected. There are six to seven hundred pawnshops in the city, so the burden on each is minimal. We hope that you will quickly send special personnel to contact and solicit donations to meet the urgent needs of the front lines. This would be most fortunate.' This has been approved.

We have noted that the weather has been getting colder recently, and the soldiers at the front and rear undoubtedly need cotton quilts. Therefore, we plan to write to your association, forwarding letters to the Pawnbroking Industry Association and the Beishi Pawnbrokers Office, requesting that you widely collect and donate them voluntarily, delivering them directly to Qianjiang Primary School on Ningbo Road for transfer to the soldiers. We have received this information. We believe that the request in the letter is for maintaining the health of the soldiers and increasing our resistance to the enemy. Moreover, considering the strength of the pawnbroking industry in the city, donating two to three thousand expired cotton quilts will not cost much. We sincerely hope that your association will lead the industry in accomplishing this righteous act. We received this information and approved it.

We believe that this matter concerns relieving the front lines and increasing our resistance to the enemy. Accordingly, we have recorded the case and forwarded it to you. We hope that when you encounter expired cotton quilts, you will donate them as much as possible or first inform our association so that we can determine donation methods to distribute the burden evenly and meet the urgent needs. This letter is addressed to members of a certain pawnshop, Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association, issued on September 18th."

### Enemy Planes Attack Beijing Twice Yesterday

Indiscriminately Bombing Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, Seven Out of Forty-Six Planes Shot Down, Two of Our Planes Also Damaged and Crashed

[Nanjing] At 8:43 AM on the 19th, several enemy planes flew in from the northwest and were intercepted by our planes in the suburbs. An hour-long aerial battle ensued. It is reported that several planes were shot down near Tangshan and in the southern suburbs. At 3:15 PM, several enemy planes flew in from the southeast, and our air force immediately dispatched planes to engage them. The enemy planes dropped bombs in residential areas of the city, killing and wounding about ten women and children in Lijia Garden. A coffin shop at Xiajiang Kao Peng was bombed, and the Municipal Hospital was slightly affected. Several civilian houses in Baijiu Fang and Ping Shi Street Jiao Shao Camp were bombed. They were then repelled by our air force, and the city quickly returned to normal. (Special dispatch on the 19th)

[Nanjing] Forty-six enemy planes attacked Nanjing from the southeast at 8:30 AM on the 19th. Upon receiving the report, our air force urgently dispatched a squadron to intercept them. Near Zhenjiang, they encountered the enemy planes, and a fierce battle immediately erupted. Our troops fought bravely, and two enemy planes were shot down in succession, one falling at Gaozi and the other at Yizheng. The remaining enemy planes, seeing the situation was unfavorable, sought revenge in desperation. Two of our planes were surrounded by the enemy. Due to the disparity in numbers, they were engaged in a bitter struggle. Although they repeatedly inflicted damage on the enemy with gunfire, one plane was eventually shot down. The other plane broke out of the encirclement and joined other planes to attack the enemy. In the midst of the fierce battle, an enemy plane suddenly rushed in from the side and damaged one of our planes. At this time, about twenty enemy planes attacked Nanjing, while the remaining planes continued to evade our pursuit. Two planes were shot down at Yangzhou and Lukou Town in Jiangning County. By about 10 AM, the remaining enemy planes began to flee southeast. The enemy planes that attacked Nanjing were unable to wreak havoc due to the fierce attack by our anti-aircraft units. It is reported that they fled the city within half an hour and dropped several bombs near Jiangdongmen, causing no major damage. The all-clear was sounded at 10:40 AM. In this battle, the enemy lost four bombers, and we also lost two planes. Two enemy combatants were killed, five were captured, and two escaped and are being pursued. Our air force soldiers Huang Juguo and Dai Guangjin died heroically, and five were injured. At 3:15 PM in the afternoon, more than twenty enemy planes attacked again and fled after being driven off by our troops, dropping bombs only in areas such as Zhonghua Road, destroying more than ten civilian houses and killing and injuring several people. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)

[Nanjing] Luo Jialun, president of National Central University, said that the university's buildings were previously hit by eight 250-pound bombs dropped by enemy planes, demonstrating the enemy's destruction of civilization and sabotage of our country's cultural institutions, further stimulating our country's anti-war sentiment. (Special dispatch on the 19th)

[Hangzhou] At 10:25 AM today, an enemy plane flew to Ningbo for reconnaissance.

America Adopts a Moderate Approach and Strives for Peace; Better to Not Excel Neighbors in Aircraft and Cannons

[New York] The National Peace Congress opened today. Secretary of State Hull gave a speech, saying, "The consequences of a completely isolationist policy are the same as the negative consequences of intervening in foreign affairs, resulting in wasted effort." The principles upon which international peace should be based have been explained in my written statement issued on July 16. The United States government is committed to peace and spares no effort because peace and the welfare of the people are fundamentally inseparable. "If the nations of the world can cooperate economically, thereby developing trade, then the lives of the people of all countries will be prosperous, and the benefits of peace for all countries will be balanced. This balance is more sustainable than that created by outdoing neighboring countries with cannons and aircraft." (Havas dispatch from New York on the 18th)

As a Matter of Conscience

Otherwise, one day it will encounter not only Chinese resistance but also the resistance of international forces." (Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 18th)

### League of Nations Discusses Preventing Trafficking of Women and Children

Planning to Establish an Office in Shanghai or Singapore to Facilitate Progress

[Geneva] The Social Issues Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly met this month. Chairwoman Countess Albert Apponyi, the Hungarian representative, discussed the issue of selecting one of two locations, Singapore and Shanghai, to establish a League of Nations office to prevent trafficking of women and children. Chinese representative Ms. Yan Yaqian, Danish representative Ms. Fu Xiangmei, British representative Ms. Ward (a member of the House of Commons), and French representative Madame Schryer successively gave speeches, all acknowledging in principle the necessity of establishing a specialized organization in the Far East to prevent trafficking of women and children. However, opinions differed regarding the location. Dutch representative Rutten, citing financial reasons, advocated selecting Singapore. Chinese representative Ms. Yan Yaqian expressed her opposition on behalf of the Chinese delegation, advocating selecting Shanghai, stating that most of those trafficked are Chinese women, and that even from an economic perspective, Shanghai is more suitable. The Chinese government's responsibility to prevent trafficking of women is currently difficult due to the inability to concentrate various intelligence affairs. The establishment of an office by the League of Nations will be extremely beneficial. Furthermore, after the office is established, it is hoped that it will publish publications in Chinese. The committee then resolved to appoint representatives from China, India, Siam, the Commonwealth of Australia, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal to form a subcommittee to study the location issue at a meeting on the 20th of this month. (Havas dispatch from Geneva on the 18th)

### Enemy Troops Again Massacre Innocents

Near Haining Road; Corpses Examined and Buried

Although various groups have appealed to uphold justice regarding the enemy troops' atrocities and indiscriminate killing of our innocent people, these actions cannot be slightly curbed. Yesterday morning, a poor Chinese man, around thirty years old, passing through Dexing Lane at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, was suddenly dragged into the lane by many enemy troops and did not come out for a long time. After the Concession police station received a report, they immediately went to investigate and found that the man had been shot dead. The injuries were on his back. Based on the wounds, they were caused by rifle bullets. The corpse was sent to the morgue, and the inspector of the Special First Court confirmed that the death was caused by gunshot wounds and ordered burial. This is also evidence of the Japanese military's atrocities.

### US Embargo on Munitions: Ambassador Wang Visits President Roosevelt

After Declaring This Action is Unfavorable to China, He Smiles and Departs; US Authorities Consider Participating in League of Nations Meetings

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull and State Department legal expert Wilson met with President Roosevelt today. According to reliable sources, the meeting concerned whether the United States should participate in the League of Nations' Twenty-Three Nation Committee. Whether the United States and China have received the request from this advisory committee is yet to be announced by US officials. According to White House sources, Chinese Ambassador Dr. Wang Zhengting met with the US President today to discuss that the prohibition of government ships carrying munitions is unfavorable to China. However, reliable sources say that the US authorities may not be able to retract this order. Dr. Wang smiled and departed after a half-hour meeting at the White House, unlike his worried expression when leaving the State Department after meeting with Hull yesterday. (Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 18th)

[Washington] According to knowledgeable sources, Chinese Ambassador Wang Zhengting's discussion concerned the US government's prohibition of its ships transporting munitions and military supplies to both China and Japan. Ambassador Wang explained the Chinese government's position on this matter. Generally speaking, the Chinese government did not want the US government to view this communication as a protest, but the consequences of this embargo, which are unfavorable to China, have greatly disappointed China and they hope the US will understand. Furthermore, Secretary of State Hull also called on President Roosevelt today, and it is said that the discussion also concerned the Far Eastern situation. (Havas dispatch from Washington on the 18th)

[Geneva] After the League of Nations Council decided to refer the dispute between China and Japan to the Twenty-Three Nation Advisory Committee, the committee has scheduled its first meeting on the 21st of this month to discuss two matters: ① Inviting representatives from both parties, i.e., China and Japan, to attend and express their opinions; ② Whether Germany should be invited to attend, given that after the committee was established in February 1933, Germany announced its withdrawal from the League in October of that year. Regarding this matter, it is generally believed that after the United States joined the committee in 1933, it set a precedent for non-member states of the League of Nations to participate in the committee. Whether the current US government will continue to participate is still under negotiation between the League of Nations and the Washington government, and the United States has not yet made a decision. The Chinese delegation firmly believes that the United States will at least send observers to attend the meeting. (Havas dispatch from Geneva on the 18th)

### Sins of Resistance Against Japan

— Lin Gengbai

Recently, patriots have often thought that the conflict between China and Japan is actually due to the Japanese militarists coercing their government, including its senior statesmen, ministers, and even its political parties, and is a reckless and destructive act that is not the original intention of the senior statesmen, ministers, nor is it what the political parties and people want to hear. This is a big mistake. Japan, given the existence of its traditional feudal group consciousness and the fact that economic development cannot but seek a larger colony as its outlet, both of these compel it to annex China. This cannot be compared to the losses of European and American capitalist countries in the European war and the difficulty of governing colonies. Okuma Shigenobu once jokingly said to Ito Hirobumi, the Resident-General of Korea, "I will be the Resident-General of China." Anyone who knows a little about Japan can say this. Moreover, their nation's shared narrow patriotism, fostered and promoted by a penchant for aggrandizement, interacts and collides with their political and economic stances, finally leading to a decisive break. Therefore, unless the organization of Japanese imperialism changes, Japan will inevitably not abandon its attempt to annex China. This is both inevitable and a foregone conclusion. To still hope for a Sino-Japanese compromise in this situation is no different from discussing the Classic of Filial Piety to ward off the Yellow Turbans; it is the height of foolishness. I firmly believe that before a revolution in Japanese society is realized, the structure of Japanese imperialism will remain strong. If there is no significant and drastic change in its politics, like the German revolution of 1919 where the monarchy was overthrown with the war, there is no room for cooperation between China and Japan. Why? Because the international environment and Japan's own politics and economy have long determined the direction of Japanese imperialists. Even if the arrogance of the military is slightly reduced, it will not change Japan's attitude towards China. Since we advocate thorough resistance, we hope that people throughout the country share this understanding, and from this understanding, they will promote and advocate it, so that the last drop of blood of the Chinese nation will not be sacrificed lightly. I will offer incense to seek this.

Since Tianjin and Beiping have become the de facto military bases of Japanese imperialists, the atmosphere of resistance has risen with the enemy's flames. Under the leadership of the central government and the supreme leader, we have long believed that peace between China and Japan has entered its final stage. After the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, this final stage has reached its end. Originally, the so-called peace between China and Japan in recent years was only a one-sided fantasy and a combination of the other side taking advantage of the opportunity. Therefore, although the integrity of Chinese territory and sovereignty can be seen in the text, this beautiful text has also been shattered by the artillery fire of Japanese imperialists. On the Chinese side, based on the greatest tolerance, it initially focused on negotiation and prepared for war as a secondary measure, and then focused on preparing for war and used negotiation as a secondary measure, never ceasing to pursue negotiations, with the intention of not only maintaining peace between China and Japan, but also laying the foundation for peace in East Asia and even world peace. Unfortunately, it initially incited Japan's contempt and intensified aggression, and then invited Japan's suspicion and exploitation, leading to preemptive actions. Their plan for a full-scale war against China within the year seems to be unfolding before our eyes, but my observation is that the cracks in the outwardly strong but inwardly weak Japanese imperialists have been exposed in the war in Shanghai. Precisely because of this, we should thoroughly resist with the ultimate determination and effort, and declare a severance of diplomatic relations. Then, the most favorable future will definitely be in China, not Japan. Everyone knows that the Japanese imperialists' seizure of Tianjin and Beiping was to occupy Chahar and Suiyuan, gradually threatening Hebei and Shanxi, and then invading Mongolia, and further attacking the Soviet Union. But we must also know that even if the Japanese imperialists' intentions for Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi are all realized, they still cannot grasp the entirety of China, which will affect their invasion of Mongolia and their attack on the Soviet Union. Therefore, before the Japanese imperialists dominate the entire China, they dare not easily launch military operations against Mongolia and the Soviet Union, because China can give them significant blows at any time. From this point of view, we can clearly see that the Japanese imperialists must place the Chinese government under their control. In other words, they must at least have a grip on controlling the Chinese government, and they must completely control it in order to invade Mongolia and attack the Soviet Union with all their strength. The anti-communist agreement with China that they shout every day is only a means for Japanese imperialists to temporarily stabilize Sino-Japanese relations. When they have victory, China's destiny will go without saying.

Knowing this even more, Japan's undeclared war, with diplomacy as a buffer, is not only deception, not only a smokescreen released by the Japanese government, but can simply be said to be that the Japanese imperialists have never been able to cover up their own weakness. Just look at recent. The full-scale war has already begun, but the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is severing diplomatic relations without admitting it. Everyone must not ignore that these tenuous diplomatic ties are the weakness of Japanese imperialists, the poison given to China, and the hidden reefs for the liberation of the Chinese nation. We must never, in times of victory or even defeat in regional battles, adopt diplomatic methods and give them more opportunities to prepare. On the other hand, our battles, whether victorious, defeated, or stalemated, must recognize that diplomatic negotiations are most likely to demoralize our troops and encourage the enemy's arrogance. The lessons of the four northeastern provinces and Tianjin are already telling us this.

What I am concerned about here is not the complete military defeat of China, but the local victories or defeats, or the stalemate, because if the result of defeat is to negotiate for peace, then the alliance under the city walls is equivalent to national subjugation. China would make a final struggle, but China were to be faced with local victories or a stalemate, third countries would inevitably come out again for further mediation, especially in the case of local victories, such as the elimination of the Japanese troops landing in Shanghai, would involve further mediation, which would somewhat have the meaning of easing the situation for Japan and embellishing the image of China. As for whether Japan can accept it, that is another question, and then the indecision of a forked road is again in front of China.

Also, as everyone knows, the Japanese imperialists cannot sustain a prolonged war against China, but in addition to the political internal crisis and economic impossibility that everyone recognizes, concern for the Soviet Union is the biggest reason. We can affirm that Japan's emphasis on China and the Soviet Union is mutually causal. When China has not been completely dominated, Japan certainly does not dare to attack the Soviet Union, but if it relaxes on the Soviet Union and uses all its military force to invade China first, allowing the Soviet Union to become stronger, and if the war is prolonged, the Soviet Union's national power will become stronger day by day. These worries behind them are equal to a mantis stalking a cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. Japanese imperialists would never be so unwise. Therefore, Japan's policy towards China can only be to advance step by step. If China can truly thoroughly resist, the collapse of Japanese imperialist forces can be awaited.

Therefore, in the midst of the Soviet Union's purge of its military and China's preparations for war, Japan's rapid and large-scale invasion of China seems to be a show of strength, but it is actually a demonstration of weakness. Because of this, the Japanese imperialists' inability to sustain a prolonged war against China is becoming increasingly evident. I believe that after a considerable period of thorough resistance, the Soviet Union will naturally join the united front, because if China wins, the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops will certainly reap the benefits of a fisherman, and if China loses, for the sake of lips and teeth being interdependent, the Soviet Union cannot but rise up to back China, that is, for self-defense, otherwise the Soviet Union, besieged by Japan and Germany, would have no chance of survival. At the same time, I believe that if China can use the stalemate of the war to urgently conclude a military agreement with the Soviet Union in the Far East, it will be especially beneficial to both.

Some people think that once the Soviet Union is drawn into the vortex of the Sino-Japanese war, it will inevitably cause suspicion from Britain and the United States, and jealousy from Germany and Italy. I feel that this only sees half of the picture, because Britain and the United States only want to maintain their market position in China and have no other intentions, and Germany and Italy have no direct interests in the Far East. The inability of Britain and the United States to help China and oppose Japan also determines that they cannot help Japan and exclude China. As for Germany and Italy, since they have no so-called interests in China, they will naturally only stand on the sidelines, which is obvious. If it is said that Britain and Germany do not want to weaken Japan's power, and even more so for the sake of the brewing of the Anglo-Japanese alliance and the establishment of the German-Japanese agreement, Britain and Germany will step forward one day, then we must also know that the contradictions between European countries and the contradictions between European and American countries are complicated and constantly changing. If it is not a conflict with their own direct interests, and if they cannot avoid resorting to force, any country is worried about affecting the whole body with one hair. In the mutual restraint, no one is willing to easily step out of their own military walls and challenge a country equal to their own national power. This is also an ironclad fact. Moreover, the United States' open door policy in the Far East and Britain's traditional foreign policy are both based on avoiding force. Although Germany and Italy are greatly watching for opportunities, especially Germany's coveting of a part of the Soviet Union's territory, they are ultimately prevented by these contradictions and will never be as reckless and destructive as Japan. Therefore, even if Britain and Germany want to favor Japan, it will at least be when the power of the Japanese imperialists is reduced to a certain limit. If during this period, China has not yet actually united with the Soviet Union in a military alliance, then their favoring of Japan will be limited to neutrality, and even if they favor Japan and resort to force, it will only be Germany, but it also depends on how the diplomacy of China and the Soviet Union is being used at that time.

Current Commentary

### How to Comfort the Loyal and Brave Soldiers

— Liu

Since the enemy re-enacted the 'January 28th' incident in Shanghai, the enemy originally hoped to "sweep away our troops within a week." However, for six weeks, our loyal and brave soldiers have resisted valiantly, and although they have not been driven out of the Jiangwan coast, they have repeatedly blunted the enemy's attack and inflicted heavy damage on them. It is no wonder that the British "have increased their respect for the martial valor of Chinese soldiers." However, this is only the beginning of a major war. The great achievements of our soldiers will surely be earth-shattering throughout history and praised by the world without decline. In the future, the country will have a constant code for revering virtue and rewarding merit, and it is not necessary for us to chatter about it. However, we, acting in accordance with our conscience, cannot help but speak out. Just think, on the battlefield, cannons are exploding in front and planes are towering above. All the merciless bullets that graze the face and ears are more than enough to cause death. And yet, they nestle in that environment, calmly responding to the battle. They charge forward, fighting bravely to kill the enemy, bandaging their wounds without knowing that the scars are still fresh. Even when dying, they still shout to kill the enemy, their spirit shaking the mountains and moving the ghosts and gods to tears. The enemy is fighting for aggression and slaughter, driven to death by their militarists. Our soldiers, who resist the aggression of a strong enemy, do not hesitate to face the bayonets and leave themselves exposed to bullets because of the survival of our masses, not wanting to see a continuation of the Korean experience. Now that our soldiers are fighting for our masses, their deaths and injuries are naturally deaths and injuries for our masses. How should we express our reverence for the meritorious soldiers and how should we do our utmost to care for the dead and wounded soldiers? This is what we should be mindful of at all times.

The reward of meritorious soldiers and the preferential treatment of the dead and wounded soldiers, the central government has its own methods. But the code of reward, in addition to promotion, awards, honorary grants, and preferential treatment, should also provide special treatment for their descendants in this era, even though there is no example of hereditary military merit. We should also imitate the stories of Lingyan Pavilion and Ziguang Pavilion, so that admiration is recorded for eternity. In addition to providing generous care and raising orphans for the fallen soldiers, we should also appropriately exempt them from taxes and educate their children. We should also build ancestral shrines to honor the loyal martyrs at the places where they died in order to inspire future generations with enthusiasm for loyalty and bravery. As for the wounded soldiers, the most important thing is to have appropriate treatment. From various reports, we know that the difficulties encountered by soldiers at the front after being injured are unspeakable. The enemy disregards humanity, disregards public law, and arbitrarily bombs ambulances, so that the wounded soldiers at the front cannot be transported out except at night. And night transportation is difficult, and the delivery cannot be done quickly. It is said that the front line should be equipped with considerable nursing equipment. And the military hospitals in the rear, since they serve the wounded, should especially treat them with deep sympathy everywhere. Their wounds are not for private matters, but for public battles. They are not for themselves, but for us. Whether they are moaning and groaning or in a state of agitation, we must know that these are the normal states of the sick. Even if they are incurable, we must make them forget the source of their pain before they pass away. This is what doctors and nurses with compassionate hearts must strive to control their emotions for, to frequently treat them, and to repeatedly comfort them, so that the injured do not feel the pain.

As for what the public should do, in addition to working hard to provide relief to the soldiers at the front, all efforts should be made to expand rescue equipment, raise consolation money for the descendants of the fallen soldiers, establish education funds, plan for job introductions, and care for the disabled soldiers and provide them with relief. I know that all those who have a concept of the country and the nation should deeply understand this meaning.

### British and French Naval Power in the Mediterranean

Naval forces greater than those used against submarines during the European War. Italy increases troop deployment to African territories.

⊙ Gibraltar. Two French cruisers and six destroyers passed through the Strait of Gibraltar from the Atlantic this afternoon and entered the Mediterranean to implement the surveillance measures stipulated in the Nyon Agreement to prevent piracy. In addition, British Mediterranean Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Hotham has arrived here aboard his flagship HMS Barham from Malta. Twenty more British warships will arrive in port tomorrow and enter the Mediterranean to implement the surveillance measures. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

[London] Regarding the Mediterranean surveillance measures, British officials have stated that the number of British and French destroyers in the Mediterranean is greater than the number used to prevent submarine attacks during the European War. Their power is extremely strong and sufficient to effectively enhance the position of Britain and France. Any attempts to blockade the Spanish Republican government through piracy will be impossible. In the future, any ships sailing to ports under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government, unless they are smuggling arms, will be facilitated by the British and French fleets. Although Britain and France have now withdrawn the surveillance work on the Spanish coast regarding the non-intervention policy, they will not change their non-intervention policy. The director of the surveillance measures relief headquarters, Dutchman Van Ham, is planning to submit a plan to the Adjustment Committee, which includes eight points:

㊀ The surveillance measures for all Spanish ports are ineffective and should be withdrawn.

㊁ The activities of ships in the ports of all relevant countries, whether or not they are sailing to Spain, should be reported to the Adjustment Committee by the governments of those countries.

㊂ Inspectors should be dispatched to board and monitor all ships of relevant countries leaving European ports, regardless of whether or not they are sailing to Spain.

㊃ The inspectors should report the number of foreign ships anchored in ports along the way to the Adjustment Committee.

㊄ The governments of relevant countries should report the number of Spanish ships in their ports to the Adjustment Committee.

㊅ For ships of neutral countries sailing to Spain, the Adjustment Committee should liaise with the governments of those countries to verify their activities.

㊆ Any aircraft flying over the Pyrenees Mountains on the border between France and Spain should be closely monitored.

㊇ The land border surveillance measures in Spain should be maintained.

France and Sweden have already accepted the above plan, and Britain will also express its approval. In short, Britain and France are now determined to maintain the non-intervention policy and will strengthen it, unless there is definite large-scale assistance to the Spanish Nationalist forces, in which case it will be considered separately. However, there is currently no indication of this. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

[London] Britain will soon establish its second air force base in the Mediterranean in Gibraltar (Malta is currently Britain's only air force port in the Mediterranean). All residents and shops in the western district of the port have been ordered to vacate within three months to build the air force port. (19th, National Maritime News Agency)

⊙ Naples. The Italian army 'Sartrada Division', stationed in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, with 231 officers and 2,791 soldiers, boarded the 'Liguria' postal ship tonight and headed to Libya for defense. In addition, the 20th Battalion and 22nd Battalion of special infantry also sailed to East Africa tonight aboard the 'Victoria' postal ship. It is unknown where the 23rd Battalion will depart on the 'Sicilia' ship. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

[Rome] The British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, England, and the French Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Balon Perrier, visited Foreign Minister Ciano together this morning. It is reported that the two Chargés d'Affaires yesterday sent Ciano a full copy of the appendix to the Nyon Agreement. Today's visit may be related to this matter. The Roman People's Daily reported that the British and French Chargés d'Affaires explained to the Foreign Minister that if Italy raises any concrete opinions on the text of the Nyon Agreement or its appendices, all signatory countries are willing to accept or consider them with enthusiasm. In addition, Italian newspapers published news from correspondents in London and Paris, stating that the Nyon Conference and the debates at the League of Nations will not deprive the Adjustment Committee of the London Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Measures of its powers, which would benefit the League of Nations, or in other words, benefit organizations that Italy does not welcome. This kind of overstepping is unlikely to facilitate the rapprochement between the positions of Britain and France and the position of Italy. However, the attitude of the Italian newspapers towards the current situation is extremely calm. (China Fire News Agency, 19th, Havas dispatch)

[London] After the establishment of the Nyon Agreement, the stalemate between Britain and France and Italy and Germany seems to be irreparable today. An Italian newspaper said that the cooperation between Britain and France in the Mediterranean is the 'most convenient exercise for future wars'. However, it is widely rumored in Berlin that German leader Hitler is unwilling to support Italy's tough stance on the situation in the Mediterranean. Well-informed observers do not believe that Italy and Germany have forgotten that the combined naval strength of Britain and France far exceeds that of Italy and Germany, and that the number of French troops is also beyond Germany's reach. (19th, National Electric)

[Rome] Italian newspapers commented on the Nyon Agreement, pointing out that it was a conspiracy by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to harm Italy. The Italian Forum newspaper stated that it is now clear that Britain and France are currently taking dangerous actions according to a predetermined plan, purely for their own interests. The ultimate goal of their predetermined plan is still unclear. It is time for us to stop the intolerable tyranny. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)

⊙ Turkish Capital. After the Turkish Parliament approved the Nyon Agreement a few days ago, it has now also approved the appendix to the agreement. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

[Berlin] French Ambassador Ponsé recently sent a copy of the appendix to the Nyon Agreement to the German Foreign Ministry in the name of French Foreign Minister Delbos, who was present at the Mediterranean Conference. (China Fire News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

### Air Defense Exercises in the Berlin Area

Large scale and long duration

[Berlin] The government has decided to hold large-scale air defense exercises in Berlin and the northern provinces in the middle of next week. It is expected to last for a week. The scale and duration are unprecedented. The results of this exercise will be applied when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini comes to Germany to review the German army, navy, and air force later this month. During the exercise, each city and village in the northern region will have commissioners in charge of air defense matters. Once the alarm is issued, residents must strictly follow the commissioners' orders and evacuate to designated locations for shelter. Without permission, they are not allowed to go outside. In Berlin, all lights must be completely turned off every night during the exercise. Residents in the most threatened areas must evacuate to cellars. Gas masks have also been distributed throughout the city for emergency use. According to the scheduled procedure, at 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month, a large number of aircraft will fly from the east to the sky above Berlin to drop bombs. The bombs used are specially for exercise purposes and will produce loud noises and thick smoke when they land. At the same time, real bombs and incendiary bombs will be used to bomb designated areas along Wilhelmstrasse, where most of the old houses were originally scheduled to be demolished and all residents were relocated months ago. This time, they will be used as bombing targets so that the city's fire brigade and police can go to put out the fire for practice. In addition, gas bombs will be dropped in many places in the city to test the nature and effectiveness of various gases. At the same time, the effectiveness of smoke bombs will also be tested. Berlin Police Chief Count Heldolf has issued a notice ordering all residents of the city to abide by the prohibitions and remain calm and maintain normalcy during the exercise. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

### Naval Battle Between Spanish Forces

Lasts for one hour

⊙ Valencia. It is reported that the Spanish Nationalist cruiser Canarias engaged three government destroyers today 30 miles off the coast of Barcelona. According to the government's Ministry of Defense, the battle lasted for one hour, and none of the government ships were damaged. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters dispatch)

### League of Nations Cautious on the Spanish Issue

Will not impose sanctions on Germany and Italy

[Geneva] Spanish Prime Minister Negrín yesterday requested at the League of Nations General Assembly that the League recognize Spain as a victim of Italian and German aggression and restore the Spanish government's right to purchase war equipment. However, according to general opinion, the League of Nations cannot discuss the issue of Italian and German aggression, because if this matter is dealt with, Article 16 of the Covenant will apply, and most member states are unwilling to be forced to take sanctions. Therefore, this issue may be discussed slightly by the Sixth Committee, but there will be no concrete measures other than empty resolutions. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)

[Geneva] French Foreign Minister Delbos met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck this afternoon to discuss bilateral relations. He then discussed the Near East issue and Mediterranean surveillance measures with Turkish Foreign Minister Rüşdü. In addition, he met with Spanish Republican Prime Minister and Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council Negrín and a delegation from the Socialist International and the International Federation of Trade Unions, including General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor Stone House, General Secretary of the British Trades Union Congress Sir Citrine, and Chairman of the Socialist International Executive Committee and Belgian socialist leader Bair Lugai. The delegation submitted to Delbos the resolutions passed by the Socialist International and the International Federation of Trade Unions, which called for assistance to the Spanish Republican government and opposed the non-intervention policy. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

### British and Australian Hampton Agreement to Open Air Service

[London] The British government has reached an agreement with the Commonwealth of Australia to establish a round-trip air route between Britain and Australia via the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies authorities have also expressed their approval of this matter and will formally reply soon. (Central News Agency, 19th, Havas dispatch)

### Roosevelt to Tour the West

Fighting with the Supreme Court

[Washington] After President Roosevelt delivered an important speech the day before yesterday, he is scheduled to tour the northwestern states of the United States within days. According to the general impression, President Roosevelt intends to continue to fight firmly with the Supreme Court, which can now be confirmed by this matter. The speech delivered by President Kwai clearly affirmed that he would continue to make great efforts to restore the stability of executive and judicial power. Although the President recently suffered a defeat in the Senate, the Supreme Court Justice Black, whom he recently appointed, is rumored to be a member of the KKK, which has caused a lot of criticism. However, the President's determination to stabilize the executive and legislative powers will not change because of this, because in the President's opinion, this stability has been undermined by a few oligarchs who want to turn the Supreme Court into a fortress for a few people to protect the interests of a few people. The President also mentioned that he would defeat the resistance of the Supreme Court, only stating that the reform of the Supreme Court should be carried out within the scope of the Constitution, because the Constitution has no clear regulations on the number of Supreme Court Justices. The speech delivered by President Kwai this time is similar in nature to a campaign speech, and its purpose is to promote his so-called Second New Deal. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas dispatch)

[Berlin] After US President Roosevelt delivered a broad speech yesterday criticizing dictatorship, German Nazi Party figures have vehemently criticized it. The party's organ, the People's Observer, stated that the situation of divergent opinions among countries around the world was already quite serious. President Roosevelt has now issued words hostile to dictatorship in a demagogic manner, and his intention is nothing more than to make the divergent state even more serious. Moreover, there are many questionable points in Roosevelt's domestic policy. Roosevelt himself also harbors dictatorial ambitions. His criticism of foreign dictatorships is intended to divert the attention of the American people in order to cover up his ambitions. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

### US to Maintain the French Franc Exchange Rate

[Washington] The exchange rate of the French franc has recently fallen sharply. Financial figures here are not worried about the position of the French franc, but believe that the US Exchange Equalization Fund may purchase French francs to maintain its exchange rate, which is not impossible. It is also said that French Finance Minister Tingley has not adopted various measures to deal with financial difficulties, which is insufficient. As for the reasons for the recent repeated depreciation of the French franc, there are only two: ㊀ The financial difficulties of France, which were generally thought to be coming to an end, have not yet been resolved. ㊁ The various social measures implemented by the government in the past are the same as the US New Deal and must be given time to take effect. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)

### Changes in the List of Japanese Envoys to Europe and the United States

Fukui Firmly Declines to Go

[Tokyo] The Japanese envoys to Europe and the United States have changed due to Fukui's firm refusal: Ishii to Britain, Godo to Germany, Matsukata Kojiro, Suzuki Bunji, and Osaka Mainichi Shimbun editor-in-chief Takaishi Shingo to the United States. Another report is that Luther, the former president of the German National Bank who once served as ambassador to the United States, arrived in Japan from Hong Kong on the 17th and is rumored to have a mission.

### Dr. Gong Sude's Faithful Advice to the Japanese People (Continued)

Now, your country has strayed into a lost path, not seeking the welfare of both countries with China in a spirit of friendship and cooperation. If your country can implement a friendly policy towards China, then what Japan wants to obtain from China will be obtained without asking. If China and Japan are friendly to each other, supply each other, and seek the prosperity of both countries based on the principle of cooperation, then Japanese universities will be full of Chinese students, and Japanese factories will obtain raw materials from China and Asia for manufacturing. Now your country does not plan this, but willingly follows a dark path, exhausting its military power to achieve its goals. From now on, the war will be prolonged, whether it is overt or covert, I am afraid it will take years.

I fear that your country will stray into a wrong path and cause disaster, and the attitude of the East towards Japan has changed. In the past, Asian nations mostly admired Japan's progress and admired it as a leader, thinking that Asian rights and interests could be guaranteed by your country and not be infringed by the West. Unexpectedly, your country has instead been蚕食 of the Asian continent to achieve its wild ambitions of鲸吞, causing Asian nations to feel frightened, and Japan has lost its position as an ally. Japan had already occupied this position, but lost it again because of its分割 of China. If it were not for the reckless use of force by Japan's military authorities, China would have already been inclined and expressed sympathy, and the rest of the Asian countries would have taken the same attitude as China. It must be known that Japan's vitality depends on commerce, but those who hate Japan will never be able to trade with Japan, so Japan's actions are tantamount to severing its own vitality.

If it is said that Japan's current actions are nothing more than following in the footsteps of Europe, it must be known that in the competition between two strong countries, none can自山. However, what the East hopes for is freedom. Now that Japan uses force against people, will it not follow in the footsteps of Europe? The Lord I have always revered said, "All who take the sword will perish by the sword." Is the current situation in Europe not an interpretation of this saying? In the past few decades, Europe used force against the world, but now it is killing each other to the point of滅亡. The way of heaven is good for还, which is clear and not bad. God is eternal, without distinction between East and West, and all are judged. If your country still refuses to repent, I am afraid it will perish and not escape God's condemnation. Indeed, the retribution of the great way is clear. Your country is sowing the seeds of military injustice today. Even if you do not immediately reap its evil results today and tomorrow, God is always there, and justice always exists, and you will eventually receive evil retribution.

I am honest and not good at words. I know that faithful words are offensive to the ear, but the pain in my heart is really great, because what I hope for is another Japan, coming out as a leader. If it is Japan under the power of the military today, it is very different from this, and it is not what I hope for. Moreover, I come from China and see its innocent farmers,颠沛流离. Once I see Japanese planes肆虐, I cannot help but tremble and lose color,仰天待毙. This kind of ignorant common people, even your Japanese people, have nothing to do with them. Now they are suffering this disaster. This kind of military action is truly unnecessary and unforgivable.

I hope that your country will repent and not blindly believe the false propaganda of militarists, but listen to the clear vision of general steady politicians, and quickly seek to restore friendship with China. Those who are strong in迷途 are brave to admit their mistakes, but the cowardly are not. Even if they know their mistakes in their hearts, they still refuse to repent and自文其其. I hope that your country can be as brave as the strong to admit its mistakes and痛改前非, so as to 收拾人心 and restore its position as the leader of peace on that day. If it is said that this is too late, I do not believe it. I have recently met with the Chinese authorities, and many said that if Japan really has good intentions and gives China a臂助, it should be respectfully welcomed. If it still maintains its old state and包存祸心, it is prepared to resist to the death. Moreover, world opinion has mostly sympathized with China. This is what I can see, so I dare to speak frankly and tell you.

If it is said that my words are nothing more than one-sided arguments, I do not want to make any speeches, but I feel pain in my heart and cannot help but cry out. Moreover, my words are no more激 than my direct and earnest advice to the Chinese leaders, and I consider my wording to be no more激. Moreover, I have given lectures to my people, and all the crimes of my nation have been指斥不赦. This is something that everyone knows.

It must be known that we all have deep regrets, including the author and others. However, what I want to say is that the international crime committed in the world today is Japan's invasion of China. This kind of action is a crime against China, destroys international peace, damages its own interests, and eliminates Japan's inherent contribution to the world. I hope that your country will reflect on itself and become the Japan that we hoped for before it entered迷途, so that we can follow it and enjoy its benefits. However, unless your country's mistakes towards China change one day, it will be difficult to receive its benefits in terms of culture, morality, and spirit. I am afraid that it will be the same in economic terms. Because I have a friendship with the people of your country, I dare to express my sincere advice. I am heartbroken and hope you will察鉴. Gong Sude 上言 (End)

### The Board of Works, etc. Expresses Disapproval to the Japanese Side for Detaining Grain

It is unreasonable to push each other off responsibility. If it is not resolved immediately, the responsibility lies with you.

The Mainland News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the troops of various countries stationed in Shanghai have refrigerated rooms and warehouses in Hongkou, in which various grains are stored, some of which are urgently needed by refugees, and some of which are stored by foreign troops. The Japanese authorities now do not allow them to be transported out uniformly. If this matter is not agreed upon at the beginning of this week, the parties concerned will jointly publish an article to correct its wrong. According to an official of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, the Japanese officials have no reason to push each other off responsibility, because the Japanese army said that this matter should be the responsibility of the Japanese navy, and when asked about the Japanese navy, they pushed the responsibility to the Japanese consulate, and the Japanese consulate borrowed the Japanese army or navy to shirk responsibility. In short, the Japanese authorities are determined to prevent this grain from being transported out. Many people believe that the north of Suzhou River is now relatively quiet, and the Japanese authorities have no right to prevent foreigners from going to transport out their own urgently needed items. The Japanese officials even refused to transport out the medicines urgently needed by the refugees from the area. If this matter is not agreed upon in the next forty-eight hours, the parties will publish an article and effectively attribute the responsibility for making the Shanghai refugees unable to get food to the Japanese officials. Yesterday, senior foreigners in this port were all indignant at the actions of the Japanese officials. It is heard that foreign visitors will also take a unified and firm action against this action. Non-official circles now believe that the Japanese officials are deeply afraid that the grain transported out will fall into the hands of the Chinese army. All circles of foreigners ridiculed this statement, saying that the various items transported out of the Hongkou area are urgently needed by civilians and will be used immediately. Even if there is any surplus, it will be stored for future lack. However, according to an official of the Food Committee of the Public Works Bureau, although the grain in the warehouses in the Hongkou area is difficult to transport out due to the difficulties of the Japanese officials, there is no need to worry about the lack of grain in the Concession immediately. As for the reason why they want to transport the grain stored in the north of Suzhou River, it is to avoid the rise in prices in the Concession. For example, refrigerated fish is one of the main meals of the Chinese, and it is now very needed to meet the market. As for rice, there will be no shortage for a while, and vegetables can also be transported in from outside the Concession without any difficulty.

### Relief Efforts

Urgent Appeal for Donations to All Refugee Camps; Repatriation of Refugees Continues

As the weather turns cooler, refugees in various camps lack clothing and food, urgently awaiting donations of funds or old clothes from all sectors to meet their needs. The relief association held a fundraising broadcast yesterday. The repatriation of refugees to their hometowns continues, but due to transportation issues, some routes have been changed. Details are as follows:

Municipal Relief Committee

The following is a summary of the Municipal Relief Committee's work on September 18: ㊀ General Affairs Group: Received donations of $5,220.80, bringing the total received to $131,722.23 in national currency, and $1,440 in government bonds (face value). ㊁ Shelter Group: Newly admitted 80 refugees, repatriated 201, voluntarily left 344, and 300 were transferred to the Taijiabao Refugee Camp for self-support. The current number of refugees in residence is 21,091 in 61 camps supported by the committee. ㊂ Repatriation Group: Repatriated 1,030 refugees on behalf of various hometown associations, traveling to Suzhou on the Xin Yingzhou. ㊃ Food Supply Group: Provided food for 22,166 refugees. ㊄ Medical Group: Treated 1,580 refugees with minor illnesses, 377 with serious illnesses, and sent four to relief hospitals. ㊅ Guidance Group: Conducted skills registration for 225 refugees and issued the "Implementation Measures for Refugee Children's Education," with instructors in each camp borrowing blackboards and textbooks to start classes.

Yesterday's Fundraising Broadcast

The Municipal Relief Association yesterday invited famous local celebrities, opera enthusiasts, and Dr. Mei Lanfang, in consultation with the Radio Industry Association, to broadcast special and exciting programs all day on the Sino-Western Radio Station, and simulcast on all Shanghai radio stations, to raise funds for refugee relief. It is reported that at 10:00 AM yesterday, the chairman of the association, Pan Gongzhan (represented by the association secretary, Lei Kenan), visited the Sino-Western Radio Station to deliver a speech, reporting on the association's work and explaining the significance and purpose of raising relief donations. The broadcast then commenced according to the scheduled program, with generous donations pouring in from all sides. The association had a tightly organized system for receiving donations, with 13 staff members, in addition to internal staff, divided into eight cars provided by Xiang Sheng, carrying official receipts and promptly proceeding to the addresses indicated by telephone to collect donations. By noon, the amount received was considerable. The association will wait until all donations have been collected before publishing the details in the newspaper.

### Cotton Vests

Only Over 30,000 Received; Continued Appeals for Donations

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Comfort Committee, its work has been extremely intense. It has been striving to solicit and supply the front-line soldiers with necessities such as cotton vests, biscuits, straw sandals, military blankets, cotton quilts, and motorized bicycles. However, it is difficult to collect large quantities of supplies immediately. Therefore, the Anti-Enemy Support Conference resolved that, apart from the Shanghai Comfort Committee, no other organization is allowed to solicit comfort funds. However, those commissioned by the Comfort Committee may issue receipts on its behalf for collection and fundraising, with well-defined regulations. In the ten days since its implementation, the results have been impressive, with a total of over 4,900 yuan collected. The names of the collecting agencies and donors will be announced soon to ensure transparency. It is also reported that the number of silk cotton vests collected by the committee has reached over 30,000 as of yesterday. The goal is to collect 200,000 vests within ten days, and we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate as much as possible.

### Enemy Troops Cruelly Inflict Starvation on Chinese in the Eastern District

No Way to Escape Due to Lack of Food; Corpses Litter the Roadside

The "North China Daily News" reports that there are still Chinese people in Hongkou and the Eastern District who are unwilling to abandon their homes and relocate. Their lives are very precarious, and the main problem is food. Some Chinese initially stored rice bags in their homes to protect against shells and bombs. However, as their food supplies dwindled, they had to rely on these "protective objects." In the past two days, families have been found starving to death on Jiaxing Road and other "no man's lands." They ran out of food and dared not venture out to escape. The corpses of men, women, and children who had starved to death can be found on Caishi Road, Yuanfang Road, and Yuanchang Road. It is truly tragic. Yesterday, someone found two small black dogs in a house in Hongkou that had been without food for at least two weeks. They were given food, and it is likely that they will be taken in. Yesterday, foreigners transporting food north of Suzhou Creek still saw some Chinese people in the Eastern District, who did not stay indoors during the day but sat in the alleys and on the roadside. Some were forced to work in areas managed by the Japanese. The northern part of the Eastern District is still burning corpses.

### The Situation of the Municipal Relief Committee in Relieving Refugees

Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, various charitable organizations in the city have risen up to form relief agencies. Subsequently, as the situation in Shanghai became increasingly tense, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to centralize relief efforts and unify administrative structures, united relevant agencies and organizations to form the Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee, with Director Pan serving as Chairman and eleven leaders from the charitable sector serving as Standing Committee members. Initially, the office was temporarily located in Renji Hall, and later moved to the Pudong Building. The work has been extremely intense over the past month. The situation since the establishment of the committee is described below:

Founding Organizations

The committee is jointly organized by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Disaster Relief Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the World Red Swastika Society, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Disaster Relief Federation, the Chinese Catholic Action Society, the Shanghai YMCA, medical organizations in the city, and various Shanghai hometown associations. Its sole purpose is to provide charitable relief in emergency situations.

Internal Organization

The internal organization of the committee is divided into a secretariat and general affairs, foreign affairs, finance, shelter, catering, repatriation, medical, guidance, security, and burial groups. The secretariat has one chief secretary, two secretaries, and several staff members. Each group has one chairman, two vice-chairmen, and several committee members. There are also several supervisory committee members responsible for supervising the progress of the committee's affairs.

Shelter and Relief

Shortly after the committee was established, the Shanghai war broke out, and residents from the war zone fled to the concessions to seek refuge. The committee immediately sent personnel to negotiate for refugee shelters and to dispatch ambulances. Subsequently, as the war zone expanded and the number of refugees continued to increase, the original shelters could hardly accommodate them. Director Pan first ordered all schools to be used for shelter as a priority, and then contacted various entertainment venues to borrow them for sheltering refugees. At that time, schools were not in session during the summer vacation, and entertainment venues were also shut down due to the situation, so using these venues could accommodate a large number of refugees.

Shelter Situation

The Shanghai war broke out on August 13, but on August 12, countless people had already been trampled by the enemy and fled. Therefore, on that day, the committee established five shelters, accommodating more than 500 refugees. Subsequently, as the war expanded and the number of refugees increased, the committee tried its best to increase the number of shelters and urged other organizations, institutions, or individuals to assist in establishing shelters. According to the committee's latest survey, there are 59 shelters established by the committee that also provide their own food, 12 shelters managed by other organizations with food provided by the committee, and 39 shelters managed by other organizations that also provide food. There are also more than 30 shelters that have been discontinued due to poor management or are still in preparation. Therefore, at most, there were over 140 shelters, accommodating approximately over 40,000 refugees. The shelters were distributed in temples, entertainment venues, schools, empty houses, and other public places. Transportation was arranged. Since the opening of the shelters, the number of refugees has increased, and there is a shortage of space. Moreover, the concessions are sometimes affected by stray bullets, so it is necessary to arrange repatriation. The committee contacted the Maritime Affairs Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the two Road Management Bureaus to designate special vehicles and ships for repatriation by both land and water routes. However, because the railway line was bombed by enemy aircraft from time to time, causing obstacles to the line, trains could not operate, so transportation relied only on automobiles and ships. Most of the repatriated refugees went to Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places. The number of refugees transported each day varied from several thousand to several hundred.

### International Relief Committee Plans to Establish Shelters in the Chinese Area

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, refugees from the war zone have fled to the concessions and poured into various shelters. However, there are still many who have not escaped from the war zone, and some who attempt to enter the concessions are prevented from doing so, leading to a very tragic situation. Now that it is autumn, the nights are exceptionally cold. Therefore, the International Relief Committee plans to use schools in the Chinese area as shelters. Mr. Orr, a standing committee member of the Committee, is responsible for contacting the Japanese side, and Qu Wenliu is responsible for contacting various schools.

### "I Have Already Dedicated Myself to the Nation and the People"

— Lu Wenting

The day before yesterday, the newspaper published a letter from Toshiko, the wife of enemy pilot Uta Magonosuke, which contained the sentence, "I hope you have the spirit of Sergeant Kurosaki, who escaped death." In contrast, in the wounded soldier hospital founded by the Yousheng Travel Group, there is our brave soldier Jiang Junde, who has dedicated himself to the country and asked his fiancée to marry someone else. This is a powerful guarantee that "the final victory belongs to us."

Ms. Lu Wenting is the founder of Youde Primary School. Now, this school may have been destroyed by gunfire. She volunteered to join the hospital as a nurse. This article was written by her. - Editor's Note

Walking on muddy roads, I arrived at the wounded soldier hospital on time. Nursing the wounded soldiers is a pleasant task for me. Every day, I seem to be taking a lesson in "National Salvation and Resistance." In my proximity to them—they are a group of national heroes—I fully understand the lives and thoughts of the brave soldiers at the front line, the facts of their heroic resistance, and the stories of their glorious sacrifices.

"Living in the rear is like living on the front line," a phrase from the great German playwright Erwin Piscator suddenly surfaced in my mind. Here, I understand how the enemy's guns and cannons stirred their emotions and transformed their consciousness. The morale is so high that ordinary people cannot imagine it. This makes me even more convinced: "The final victory will inevitably belong to us."

"Miss Lu!" A Sichuan accent.

"What? Do you want tea?" Turning around, I knew that a soldier from the ×× division, ××× regiment was calling me. His name is Jiang Junde.

"Excuse me, I would like to ask you to write a letter for me and send it to my father at home."

I happily agreed. Then, he described the contents of the letter he wanted to send home:

"First, tell my father that I was slightly injured while fighting the enemy in Shanghai and am now staying in the hospital. Everything is very comfortable, and he should not worry about me. Also, say that I will go to the front line to kill the enemy again after I recover, to avenge our nation and country, and he should not worry about me."

He paused here. Perhaps the wound was hurting, and he rubbed the bandaged area of his right knee with his hand, but he did not show any weakness, making me feel his great spirit.

After a while, he continued:

"Miss Lu, please also tell him in the letter that this resistance is to fight for the nation's freedom and for the country's survival. We do not want to be slaves, so we must fight the enemy desperately. 'Loyalty to the country' is a man's duty! Also, tell him that loyalty and filial piety cannot be fully realized. Please tell him to take good care of himself and protect my younger siblings. Say that when I have killed all the enemies in our territory, then I can go back and be filial to him."

His words moved me deeply. I was excited, I was happy, and I admired his correct understanding of this resistance even more.

"Nothing else?"

"No, there is more. Tell him that if the family of my fiancée comes to talk, tell her to marry someone else. Say that I have already dedicated myself to the country and the people, and I am afraid of ruining her lifelong happiness." After a pause, he said again: "I am afraid that there is a shortage of pocket money at home. I will send the salary I receive from the post office, so please mention it in the letter. Say that I will send more money later if I have it."

At this time, two images suddenly floated in my mind. One is of patriots bravely sacrificing their happiness, holding guns, blowing bugles, and resisting the enemy for the independence and freedom of the motherland! The other is of those so-called high-class Chinese enjoying themselves in the Paramount Ballroom.

"The Turks have arrived under the walls of Byzantium, and the gentlemen there are still asleep." Oh, drunken and dreaming people! If you could stand in front of the patriots for one minute, I think you would truly be ashamed to death!

Mr. Wang Xiaolai

Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, yesterday sent all his silverware to the Central Bank to purchase National Salvation Bonds and sent a letter to the Fundraising Headquarters saying: "Dear Sirs, Xiaolai serves the community and does not engage in production. His salary is insufficient to support his family, and he usually relies on borrowing to make ends meet. After the war, it has become even more difficult. However, my heart for saving the country not only dares not lag behind others but also often strives to be a leader. At this time of raising government bonds, Xiaolai, as the captain of the general team, should also do his best. Now, in the absence of any other way, I respectfully donate all the silver shields, silver tripods, and other silverware given by friends to purchase National Salvation Bonds. I transfer the love of my friends for me to love the country, so that even those who are as powerless as Xiaolai can be powerful. I am ashamed and excited to draw this. I hope you will understand."

Active Promotion

The National Salvation Bonds Citizens' Fundraising General Team, First Special Zone Group, is actively carrying out fundraising work. The group has successively established ten drama teams and four special teams. To encourage citizens to actively purchase bonds, a large number of promotional materials have been produced and distributed to various teams.

The group has also scheduled to announce the initial fundraising results next week.

Pei Yuanding was elected as the sub-team leader, Zhang Fuquan and Sun Zhongshu as deputy sub-team leaders, and Shen Laizhou as the chief of staff. In addition to soliciting 5% of the members' capital and 10% of their public reserve funds to purchase National Salvation Bonds, the association will also allocate 1,000 yuan from its fund deposits to purchase National Salvation Bonds as an example.

Women's Mobilization

Charitable Group Nursing Hospital

The Wartime Refugee Relief Association of the Joint Relief Association of Various Charitable Organizations has established a branch nursing hospital at 68 Yuyuan Road to provide medical care for wounded soldiers. Huang Dinghu, the son of Huang Hanzhi, Vice Chairman of the Association, serves as the director of the hospital. All operating expenses are raised by Huang Hanzhi and others. Dr. Ai Xianren, a German surgeon, has been hired to assist. In recent days, the hospital has admitted over 180 wounded soldiers, and over 40 have been cured and discharged.

Seamen's Relief Efforts

Under the leadership of Commander Yu Hu, the Chinese Seamen's Anti-Enemy Support Association has been working extremely hard on rear-area affairs since the outbreak of the war, including comforting, transporting, rescuing, and fundraising. It has shown unique performance in all these aspects. In light of the intense fighting at the front lines in recent days, a relief team has been sent to rescue many of our wounded soldiers under heavy fire and immediately send them to the hospital. It is heard that the relief team's required trucks, gasoline, stretchers, equipment, and even the food expenses of the staff are all funded by the Seamen's Support Association.

It is also heard that the person in charge of the hospital said that as the weather is getting colder, there is a shortage of cotton quilts and cotton vests, and efforts are being made to purchase them.

### Cotton Production in Pudong on the Market; Please Handle Subsidized Loans

Cotton production in various counties in Pudong is on the market, but it cannot be transported and sold, causing panic in the rural economy. Diao Yebai, a citizen of Fengxian, telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Department yesterday, requesting that cotton subsidized loans be launched early to facilitate financial turnover. The original text is as follows: "It is found that the economic center of the four counties of Pudong, Fengnan, Jinshan, and Chuansha has always been the export of large quantities of cotton. Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, yarn factories have closed, sales have been sluggish, and there is no formal price on the market. It is heard that each dan is only worth about five or six yuan. Farmers are deeply worried about the excessive losses. Cotton merchants have also been forced to stop weighing because they have not cleared their remaining goods and have no capital. As a result, finance has stagnated, causing panic to businesses, people, rich, and poor alike. Now that the land tax collection period is approaching and National Salvation Bonds are also being issued, funds are urgently needed everywhere. If no measures are taken to dredge the economic source, the situation will be even more desperate, and the impact will be significant. Previously, the Internal Affairs Department had a subsidized loan plan for this problem, and agricultural products were included in it. The autumn harvest in various counties in Pudong has already been put on the market and is urgently awaiting transportation. I dare to telegraph and request the Director of the Provincial Farmers' Bank to instruct the offices of the bank in the four counties of Pudong, Jinshan, Fengnan, and Chuansha to launch cotton subsidized loans as soon as possible. At the same time, set up warehouses as usual and open cotton pledge loans. On the one hand, ask the county governments to: ㊀ invite local merchants to reduce the monthly interest on cotton. ㊁ Invite local gentry, merchants, and small cotton dealers to raise funds for loan offices in various districts, towns, and villages to handle small cotton loans and collect scattered cotton catties to maintain people's daily lives. ㊂ Concentrate and store goods. There may be unexpected dangers in areas close to the war zone. ㊃ Stipulate that farmers with more than three dan of cotton are allowed to report to the Baojia chief to verify the weighing together with the township head, add a printed stamp on the cotton bale, report to the district office for joint and several liability guarantee, and issue a certificate. With this certificate, they can temporarily borrow from financial institutions, and the procedures are more stable. In summary, the above methods will not only provide an outlet for cotton production and circulate economic sources, but also benefit the anti-war military needs and people's livelihood. The views of a frog in a well are respectfully submitted for approval and implementation. I am grateful."

### National Salvation Movement

The Education Sector National Salvation Association recently undertook the following work: ㊀ Providing temporary board and lodging for unemployed teachers and staff, commencing immediately, with He Bingsong and Lin Zhengong as the director and deputy director respectively; ㊁ The establishment of a Wartime Education Research Committee, with Chen Jicheng et al. as members of the middle school group, Gu Yinxia et al. as members of the primary school group, and Xu Zeli et al. as members of the mass education group; ㊂ Collecting eight thousand cotton vests for wounded soldiers; ㊃ Sending letters to the authorities requesting that schools in the concessions be allowed to open in order to maintain education; ㊄ The Social Bureau is holding short-term wartime mass education classes, urging all staff and schools to conscientiously comply.

Labor Circles

The labor and agricultural circles of this city convened a preparatory meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM to organize the All-China Labor Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, drafted a simple charter, and submitted it to the various Anti-Japanese Support Associations for registration. Over one hundred people including Geng Huizhen attended, with Chen Guoliang as chairman. The following was resolved: ㊀ Sending a telegram to the labor and agricultural circles of all provinces and counties across the country, urging them to unite immediately, prepare for armed resistance, and unanimously kill the enemy; ㊁ Comrades in the agricultural and labor circles must all bear the responsibility of saving the country. At a minimum, each person should donate national currency every month to strengthen national defense; ㊂ Strictly prohibit workers from working for the enemy.

Cultural Circles

The Cultural Circles National Salvation Association's national salvation broadcast is scheduled for 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM today, with lawyer Yu Chengxiu giving a speech on 'Amending the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China' at the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications.

Children's Circles

The Children's Circles National Salvation Association established its drama department yesterday. Drama members Chen Juanjuan, Wang Ziqing, Tang Genbao, Yao Yuanyan, Jiang Quqiao, Xu Xiangying, Yang Bijun, Shen Jun, Mou Ling, etc. attended. Under the guidance of Tang Na and Qian Hui, they allocated training to each member of the drama departments and determined the children's national salvation scripts: ㊀ 'Dreaming of Visiting Beiping' (performed by Qian Hui, Chen Juanjuan, Mou Ling, Li Keng, etc.), ㊁ 'In the Midst of Artillery Fire' (performed by Chen Juanjuan, Yao Yuanyan, Shen Jun, Wang Ziqing, Xu Xiangying, Tang Genbao, Jiang Quqiao, etc.), ㊂ 'Put Down Your Whip' (performed by Yang Bijun, Shen Jun, Wang Ziqing, etc.). Intensive rehearsals will begin immediately. After the rehearsals, they will perform at various wounded soldier hospitals and refugee shelters, and then perform mobile performances in various parts of the capital. An agreement has also been reached with the Lianhua branch factory to produce films to be taken to various towns and villages and inland areas for mobile screenings, in order to instill national salvation ideas in compatriots in the interior.

Cartoon Circles

Today (the 20th), 'National Salvation Cartoons' is published, sponsored by the Cartoon Circles National Salvation Association. It is a nationwide mobilization of the cartoon circles to attack the enemy. The themes are popular and highly meaningful in awakening the people and striving for national salvation. Moreover, the selling price is lower than the cost, making it a truly mass-market reading material in this extraordinary period. This newspaper warmly welcomes various national salvation groups to purchase in large quantities and send them to the front lines to comfort the heroic anti-Japanese soldiers, or to post them in the back alleys and shelters. The newspaper hopes that all propaganda efforts in the rear will focus on the propaganda materials for all-out resistance in the current issue of "National Salvation Cartoons" to support national salvation work.

### The Tax Bureau Issues a Statement Regarding the Truth About Tax Payments Limited to Cash

The recent reports regarding tax payments being limited to cash have attracted considerable attention from society. A reporter from Guomin News Agency, wanting to clarify the truth, specifically visited relevant personnel at the Tax Bureau. According to them, the bureau collects national taxes in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's order, which limits payments to legal tender and negotiable instruments that can be exchanged for legal tender. Drafts and remittances are not applicable. The bank had not added a seal of approval for cash payment to the application for the check submitted by the Da Zhonghua Company for tax payment previously, and only allowed remittance, so the bureau was unable to accept it. Furthermore, the Ministry responded to the Hubei Provincial Government's request to allow merchants to pay taxes by check by stating that the application process should still be followed, and did not approve remittance for tax payment. Therefore, the bureau's tax payments should be made in legal tender and negotiable instruments that can be exchanged for legal tender. The news reported by a certain newspaper on the 16th contains many misunderstandings.

### Changshu Detains Rice, Shanghai People's Food Association Sends Personnel to Negotiate

The Municipal Social Bureau Sends Another Letter to the County Government Urging Swift Release

According to the Central News Agency, since the incident of the Changshu County Government detaining grain, the shipment of river rice from the interior to Shanghai has gradually been blocked, causing great concern among various organizations and groups in Shanghai. The Municipal People's Food Regulation Committee, in order to coordinate the supply of food to all of Shanghai and dredge the sources, has been deeply affected. Therefore, Lu Muqin was specifically sent to Changshu to negotiate with the county government. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government urging the county to release the grain quickly in order to maintain provincial laws and regulations. The Municipal Social Bureau also, in accordance with the document from the Jiangsu Provincial Food and Fuel Regulation Office, sent a letter to the county requesting the release of both the ships and the shipowners. Furthermore, after the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a joint letter from the Lianyi Association of merchants shipping goods from Shanghai and the Public Association of Rice Dealers, requesting them to vigorously strive for the release, the chamber immediately sent a letter to the Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, stating (details omitted above): Upon investigation, before the batch of rice was loaded in Changshu, the People's Food Regulation Committee, jointly organized by the Shanghai military, political, police, and commercial sectors, issued a certificate proving that it was legal trade and there were no irregularities. This can serve as irrefutable evidence. After the detention, the Shanghai Office of the Jinghu Garrison Command issued a pass, and the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau sent a telegram to the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, instructing your county government to release the cargo. Your local government has disregarded the impartial handling of the matter by the responsible officials of the Jiangsu and Shanghai provinces and cities. Where is the law to be placed? We request your association to vigorously strive for the release of the people and the rice, truly appreciating the public interest.

### Chamber of Commerce Writes to Water and Electricity Company Requesting Acceptance of Chinese Bank Checks

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the French Water and Electricity Company yesterday, stating: Sirs, We have received a letter from Chen Gengyu, a resident of 220 Route Pichon, reporting that the French Water and Electricity Company refuses to accept checks for water and electricity bills, requiring payment in cash or the use of foreign bank checks. He requests our assistance in negotiating a solution. We have investigated and found that foreign-owned telephone companies within the concession have been accepting checks from Chinese banks for payments, recognizing that the creditworthiness of Chinese banks has been improving over the years and is no less than that of foreign banks. There is no reason for a company receiving payments to discriminate. This action only creates difficulties for customers and gives Chinese people the unfavorable impression that the division between Chinese and foreigners has not been eliminated. For the convenience of the majority of your Chinese customers and for the sake of your long-standing good relationship, we trust that you will not persist in this prejudice. Therefore, we are writing to you requesting a satisfactory response.

### School Workers Also Know How to Save the Nation

### The Luodian Front is Quiet and Peaceful, Enemy Forces Attack Liuhang in Two Routes

Our Troops Intercept and Defend the Original Positions Separately, Fierce Battle on Huangxing Road Last Night, Enemy Forces Collapsed and Retreated, Desperate Measures, Enemy Planes Scatter Absurd Leaflets

Since our main force concentrated on the first line of defense, the enemy is now taking a central breakthrough plan, with Liuhang as the target of attack. After 12:00 last night, the enemy attacked in two routes, one from Shulibiao on the east side of Luodian, southward towards Zhangjiazhai, Xiezhaizi, and Wuzhai, and the other from Daijiazhai and Lijiazhai on the northeast side of Liuhang, towards Xiaozhujiazhai, Zhuzhai, and Jinjiawan, hoping to break through our police line and concentrate forces to attack the central point of Liuhang. The battle last night was exceptionally fierce. The enemy attacking southward from Shulibiao was immediately repelled by our army, and we continued to defend our original positions. The battle at Zhuzhai and Xiaozhujiazhai was even more intense, and the enemy artillery also concentrated its bombardment. Our army fought bravely, but due to the dense enemy artillery fire, Zhuzhai and Xiaozhujiazhai were once lost, retreating to Jinjiawan and fighting the enemy across the river. We used heavy machine guns and small cannons to densely sweep the enemy, and on the other hand, we attacked the enemy's rear from Yangmu Bridge. Fierce fighting continued until 3:00 AM, when the enemy forces could not hold out and retreated, and our army regained the original positions of Zhuzhai and Xiaozhujiazhai. There was no battle in Luodian Town last night, and there was only minor contact in Zhabei. Taking advantage of the enemy's change of guard, our army fired on the enemy with rifles and machine guns. The enemy was momentarily panicked and responded hastily, suffering many casualties. The enemy artillery team in Hongkou Park fired on our positions from time to time, intermittently, with the aim of only disrupting and warning us, causing no loss to us. Furthermore, the enemy attempted to destroy our rear transportation. Yesterday, they continuously bombarded Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai with artillery, but due to inaccurate targets, there was no damage.

### War News Brief

North of the Huishan area, the sound of machine guns, rifles, and heavy artillery did not stop all night. Between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM, there was fierce fighting near Bazibao and the North Railway Station. There was also artillery fire near Baoshan Road, but the sound was sparse. The western district and the Huangpu River were quiet and peaceful. At 7:45 AM this morning, the sound of machine guns could be heard continuously near the North Railway Station. At 7:55 AM, an enemy plane flew to the South City to drop leaflets. Between 7:30 AM and 8:00 AM, the artillery fire north of Jiangwan was quite intense. Between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM, a fire broke out near Hongkou Park (i.e., north of the enemy headquarters). The old factory of the Commercial Press in Zhabei was bombarded. Between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, there was artillery fire near Baoshan Road and Baotong Road.

### The Enemy's Attack on Liuhang Was Smashed By Our Forces

To Threaten Our First Line of Defense, We Intercepted and Killed Many Enemies

After the enemy's plan to attack Luodian failed, they changed their target yesterday and invaded Liuhang, attempting to break through our central line and threaten our first line of defense. That area is located between Luodian and Dachang, and is an important town on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Our army had made preparations early and had heavily armed troops stationed there. Starting from 10:00 PM last night (the 19th), the enemy launched a two-pronged attack. One part launched a fierce attack on our Wuzhai position north of Liuhang, which was met with a head-on blow from our forces and made no progress. The other part, with extremely elite troops, used several armored vehicles for cover and launched a fierce attack on our warning line at Zhaowangmiao, Zhuzhai, and Xiaozhuzhai in front of Liuhang. We swept them with machine guns, killing many enemies. Although the enemy was attacked, they still tried to stubbornly advance. Our army was exceptionally strong and rushed out of the trenches for hand-to-hand combat. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy finally broke through our line of defense. Our army then retreated slightly, confronting the enemy across the two banks of the Jinjiawan small stream. Soon, our reinforcements arrived, charged across the stream, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy many times, falling forward but continuing the attack. Finally, the enemy was defeated and the original warning line was restored. In this battle, both the enemy and our forces used elite troops to bravely engage in hand-to-hand combat for several hours, so both sides suffered heavy losses. However, we were finally able to restore our original position, and the reinforcements continued to arrive, and an order was immediately issued to launch a counterattack.

### The Enemy's Attack on Zhabei Ended in a Miserable Defeat

The Enemy Headquarters Was Hit and Caught Fire

Near Bazibao and the North Railway Station, the enemy suddenly launched an attack on that line with a dense force at around 8:00 PM last night. At the same time, the enemy artillery also concentrated on indiscriminate bombardment of that area, hoping to suppress our rear, but all were ineffective. In addition to immediately responding to the battle, our rear artillery also launched a fierce counterattack. After about an hour of fighting, the enemy headquarters near Hongkou Park was hit by our artillery and caught fire. At around 7:40 AM this morning, a small unit of enemy troops attacked near the North Railway Station and was swept away by our machine guns, with more than a dozen enemy casualties. Before long, they tried to peek again, but were still repelled by our army. Our army maintained its original line of defense.

### There Was Fierce Fighting on Huangxing Road Last Night

Two Enemy Attacks Were Repelled By Our Forces

About a thousand enemy troops in the city center took advantage of their heavy artillery cover at midnight yesterday and launched a fierce attack on our army positions on Huangxing Road and Ningguo Road. Several armored vehicles were their vanguard. Our army calmly waited, and when they were close, they immediately met them head-on with hand grenades, mortars, and small cannons. Seeing that the armored vehicles had lost their effectiveness, the enemy rushed with infantry. Our army then jumped out of the trenches and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat with bayonets. The enemy was frustrated and immediately retreated, but soon came again. Our army immediately launched a dense sweeping fire with machine guns and other light and heavy weapons, and showed great power, rushing into the enemy ranks, charging left and right, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Seeing that the situation was unsustainable, the enemy urgently increased reinforcements, and our rear reinforcements arrived in time, so the fierce battle began again. The sound of machine guns, rifles, and heavy artillery did not stop all night, and the fighting continued until before dawn this morning, when the enemy retreated due to heavy casualties. Our army held its original position.

### The Enemy Retreats to the Northeast of Luodian Town

Waiting for Reinforcements, the Frontline is Quiet

The enemy launched three general offensives against Luodian, and after our brave resistance, they suffered heavy casualties. Although their troops once again occupied the town, there was no complete building left after the enemy's dense artillery fire and arbitrary burning, and they were threatened by our heavy troops on Xiaotangzi. They dared not hold on stubbornly, so they also retreated to the northeast of the town to deploy defenses, waiting for reinforcements. Therefore, the battle on the front line was quiet, and artillery shells were occasionally fired at our rear positions, but there was no damage to us.

### Our Army in Pudong Repels Enemy Forces

Twelve Enemy Planes Flew to Pudong This Morning to Reconnoiter

The Japanese side has not yet taken an offensive against our army positions in Pudong. The entire line was quiet last night. Only enemy boats in Pudong patrolled back and forth. Our army was on high alert at various ports, and only sporadic machine gun fire occurred between the two sides, without any intense action. This morning at 9:00 AM, twelve enemy planes, divided into four teams, circled over the area around Qichang Wharf, firing machine guns from time to time. At the same time, Japanese warships in the Huangpu River also opened fire to assist. At 10:00 AM, the situation calmed down. Our side suffered no damage.

### An Enemy Plane Crashed into the Huangpu River

Fifty-One Enemy Planes Flew West This Morning

Yesterday, as soon as dawn broke, many enemy planes flew to our positions in the Pudong area to reconnoiter. One of the seaplanes was hit by our machine gun fire. In a hurry, it tried to escape to Songkou, but when it flew near the Mitsui Wharf, the damaged fuselage was severely shaken, causing it to crash into the Huangpu River near the Mitsui Wharf and sink immediately.

According to news, enemy planes attacked the capital twice yesterday, but to no avail. This morning (the 20th), another fifty-one enemy planes, in formation, went west along the railway line. They passed Kunshan at about 11:00 AM and continued to fly west.

### Enemy Deaths Have Exceeded 20,000

The Kurume Division Has Been Almost Completely Eliminated, One Division of the Fifth Reinforcements Will Arrive in Shanghai Within Days

According to the Dagong News Agency, since the Shanghai battle broke out on August 13, the total number of enemy deaths has exceeded 20,000. In addition, those killed in action by the air force are not included. At the same time, the most severely casualties were the Kurume Division, the enemy forces who first attacked our Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Shizilin, and Luodian areas. Because this batch of enemy troops was repeatedly attacked by our army, there were almost no survivors. The enemy naval special marine corps occupying the Hongkou district was also almost completely wiped out. Therefore, the enemy's losses in this invasion of Shanghai are the highest record in the Sino-Japanese war. Furthermore, according to reports received from relevant parties, the enemy's fifth reinforcement force, totaling one division, has now been mobilized from Nagasaki, Kobe, and other places, and is expected to arrive here in the next few days.

### Enemy Planes Again Drop Absurd Leaflets

Two enemy planes flew over the concession to the Nanshi area at 7:30 AM this morning, circling and reconnoitering, and dropping absurd and shameless leaflets. The enemy planes flew south of Xieqiao in Nanshi to the Longhua Road area, turned and flew towards Pudong. However, when the enemy planes flew low, they fired intermittent machine guns at pedestrians, but did not drop any bombs this morning.

At around 9:00 AM this morning (the 20th), more than a dozen enemy planes scouted Pudong and South Shanghai, dropping more than a dozen bombs in areas such as Zhenru and Zhongshan Road, hoping to destroy our rear transportation, but the damage to us was minimal. Soon after, seventeen of the planes gathered and flew in a southeast direction.

### More Than a Thousand Enemy Corpses Transported Back to Japan

Blood Stains Were Visible on the Roads Traveled By the Vehicles

According to reliable news, at 11:00 PM on the 18th, more than thirty enemy trucks, each carrying thirty to forty enemy corpses wrapped in black cloth and covered with tarpaulins, passed through Wusong Road and Broadway Road to the Yangshupu Wharf, where they were hurriedly loaded onto the enemy transport ship Shanghai Maru, which was moored there, and transported back to their country. According to eyewitnesses, the last of the trucks carried mostly broken feet and arms, and incomplete enemy corpses, with blood dripping and some exposed beyond the tarpaulin. The scene was too tragic to bear. Yesterday, when people passed by the roads traveled by the trucks, they could still see blood stains as far as the Yangshupu Wharf. It is estimated that the total number of enemy corpses in this batch was more than a thousand.

### An Enemy Plane Landed in Wuxi

[Wuxi] At 10:00 AM on the 19th, an enemy plane that attacked Nanjing was damaged and landed on the Jiangtan in Fuxing Town, which belongs to the county. The two pilots swam to escape, fired their guns to resist arrest, and were shot and killed by strong men. One strong man was also injured (Special Dispatch on the 19th).

### Enemy Warships Outside Lianyungang Sailed Elsewhere

Sea News, The enemy warships outside Lianyungang have sailed elsewhere after we blockaded the harbor. However, seaplanes sometimes fly over Lianyungang to scout. On the morning of the 15th, its tail was damaged by our anti-aircraft guns and it fell into the outer sea (Special Dispatch on the 19th).

### The Enemy Is Engaging in Scaremongering, Saying That Nanjing Has Become a Dangerous Area

Will Send a Large Squad of Enemy Planes to Bomb, The Enemy Notifies Foreign Nationals to Evacuate

Hasegawa, Commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, sent a note to the consulates of various countries stationed in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 19th of this month, stating that the Japanese Navy Air Force will bomb our country's capital on the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Please notify all foreign nationals in Beijing to evacuate to safe places by the morning of that day to avoid danger. All foreign warships and merchant ships berthed there are also requested to sail to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

It is also heard that the foreign consulates in Shanghai are scheduled to meet this afternoon to discuss the matter in order to decide on a plan and respond to the Japanese side. It is also learned that the French side will definitely not make plans to evacuate.

According to confirmed news, the French Consul General in Shanghai replied to the Japanese side this morning that the French Embassy and Consulate in Nanjing, and the warships on the Jiangmian in Xiaguan, cannot withdraw. Please pay attention to all French interests in the capital of China.

### The Japanese Army's Encirclement Attempt in North China Fails

Our Grand Army in Pingnan Is Completely and Securely Deployed; Fierce Fighting Erupts on the Left Flank of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line; Enemy Troops at Xingji Station Have Already Retreated

[Jinan] There are no changes on the front today. On the left flank, a certain unit of our fresh troops is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy, killing many in hand-to-hand combat. They once recaptured several villages, but due to the lack of fortifications, they returned to their original positions. A certain regiment of ours arrived two or three miles south of Xingji Station. The enemy at Xingji Station had already retreated. We are guarding the Niangniang River south of the station. Employees of the Xingji Machinery Plant have been ordered to prepare to return to the station. Several enemy planes bombed Cangzhou Station this morning, injuring one person and damaging the power lines. One plane scouted the Xingqi River in this city via Sangyuan. At 4 p.m., twenty-one planes passed over Linyi and Tengxian to scout Xuzhou, then flew back to Haizhou. Three more planes strafed south of Xingji. At the same time, an enemy armored train arrived south of Xingji. It seemed they intended to attack tonight, but they were repelled by our armored train. Furthermore, over eighty remnants of the enemy at Lilou have been surrounded by us. (19th Dispatch)

[Beiping] According to a statement by the Japanese military headquarters here, Japanese troops are continuing to advance south of Beiping. At the same time, they acknowledge that Chinese troops are moving southwest in excellent order. Sources here point out that the failure of the Japanese attempt to encircle has been confirmed by the Japanese side. In Shanxi, the Chinese troop positions are extremely secure, and repeated Japanese attacks have been unsuccessful. (20th National Telegram)

[Tianjin] According to news received here today, the Japanese army's attempt to encircle Chinese troops in North China has been confirmed to have failed. Five thousand Chinese troops fifty kilometers south of Beiping have completed their deployments securely amidst heavy rain. The Japanese used mechanized units to bomb and pursue, but did not achieve the desired victory. Furthermore, they consider the changes in position by the Chinese troops to be strategically unpredictable, and therefore feel quite apprehensive. (20th National Telegram)

[Beiping] According to a reporter from the Haitong News Agency who personally inspected the Japanese positions between Beiping and the Pinghan Railway, the route of the Japanese troops can be traced by the bullet holes and the ruins of collapsed walls. The deep trenches dug by the Chinese troops to obstruct tanks are visible everywhere. However, the reporter didn't see the corpses of fallen officers or soldiers on the battlefield because both sides had buried them. The reporter went on to say that the failure of the Japanese encirclement attempt can be proven by the fact that very few prisoners were captured when Zhuozhou fell on Saturday. This is because the Chinese troops had completely withdrawn in orderly formation twelve hours before the Japanese troops entered the city. And the other Japanese advances encountered fierce and determined resistance from the Chinese troops. (30th National News Agency)

### Air Defense Drill Held in Berlin

Total Mobilization of the City; Extremely Tense Situation

[Berlin] The city's air defense drill is scheduled to begin tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. However, from 1:00 a.m., all personnel in charge of air defense, police, fire brigades, ambulance teams, and anti-gas teams will be fully mobilized. The city police also worked all day today, posting signs with the words "Resident Shelters" at designated locations in various districts. Three anti-aircraft guns were installed on the rooftops of the Aviation Bureau, and powerful searchlights illuminated the sky all night. According to the planned procedure, "enemy" planes will drop incendiary and poison gas bombs on the Imperial Hotel and the Potterdamer department store tomorrow morning. (Note: Before becoming Chancellor, Hitler resided in the Imperial Hotel for many years.) As soon as the bombing is complete, five hundred people disguised as victims of poisoning and bombing will be scattered in front of the hotel, and the ambulance team will transport the "dead" to the "cemetery," namely the Tiergarten Park, for burial. The injured will be treated in various rescue hospitals. Each of these people disguised as casualties will receive a reward of five marks per day. In addition, the fire brigade will immediately drive to various thoroughfares to practice extinguishing fires after the air raid siren sounds. At the same time, the city's anti-aircraft guns will also fire intensely at enemy planes. The scene at that time will definitely be extremely tense. (Havas Dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)

### Barbaric Acts of the Enemy

Residents of Dexing Lane Stabbed to Death; Seven Hundred Workers in the Eastern District Shot

The barbaric acts of the enemy are constantly appearing, and the number of innocent civilians who have been tragically killed is countless. On the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Police found a Chinese man, about thirty years old, who had been killed by a rifle in Dexing Lane at the intersection of Hainan Road and North Jiangxi Road. Three days later, yesterday at 10:00 a.m., the Shanghai Municipal Police found another man, also about thirty years old, dead in the house at No. 27 Dexing Lane. It was discovered that he had been stabbed to death with a bayonet. The case was reported to the First Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Zhang Zongru and forensic doctor Zhang Yan to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the corpse had a bayonet wound on the thenar area of the left hand, a bayonet wound on the abdomen and wrist, and a bayonet wound on the right back. It was confirmed that he had been stabbed to death with a bayonet. Since no relatives of the deceased could be found, the body was ordered to be buried at the Pushan Villa. It is understood that there are still some residents living in the lane.

The Yangshupu area in the eastern district of Shanghai is a district with many factories, with a total of 700,000 workers. Although many had fled after the August 13th Incident, a small number had not left. Yesterday, we met a refugee from that area, Mr. Chen, who is over fifty years old. He said that about ten days ago, he and more than seven hundred others fled to Yuanfang Road, where a team of enemy soldiers ordered the young and strong to stand in one place and massacred them all with machine guns. Only eighty or so elderly and weak people were left, and he himself had been stabbed in the face.

### Eight European and American Statesmen Broadcast Speeches on Peace

Hull Says Complete Isolation Is Impossible; Eden Expresses Willingness to Cooperate Economically with the U.S.

[New York] The National Peace Conference today broadcast the speeches of important statesmen from eight countries on the issue of world peace to one hundred million listeners in more than sixty countries. U.S. Secretary of State Hull was one of the speakers, stating that while "we are determined both to avoid embroilment and to avoid entanglement in the armed conflicts of other nations," this policy "must be implemented in a way that will contribute to establishing conditions everywhere under which peace can be maintained." "Complete isolation in this new world is impossible. If order and law disappear in the world, the security of the United States will be greatly harmed." "Some believe that peace can only be achieved after aggression and conquest. This is a delusion. A country that starts a war, initially believing that lasting peace lies in the complete suppression of the enemy, will eventually see that the enemy's future still exists." Hull also said that any country that does not pay attention to the safety or interests of its overseas citizens will soon have even its most basic rights disregarded. In his view, economic improvement is the best hope for peace, because prosperous people are less likely to be tempted into war, while poor countries that see life as expendable are more likely to take a gamble or resort to militarism to achieve their goals. British Foreign Secretary Eden also broadcast a speech from Geneva, stating that there is no reason to be overly pessimistic about the economic situation of the United States or other countries in the world. Although international trade has encountered difficulties, there are signs of recovery. He hoped that Britain could establish an agreement with the United States to reduce tariffs based on the most-favored-nation principle, which would not only benefit both parties but also the world. Most countries are more prosperous than last year, which alone shows that a policy of peace is appropriate. Other politicians who participated in the broadcast included French Prime Minister Xu Dan, Bison Chilann, Canadian Prime Minister King, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, Colombian President Lopez, and Czech Prime Minister Hodza. (Reuters Dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)

### Trivial Comments

— Xiang

There's a saying: "Adapt to circumstances." Adapting to circumstances means avoiding danger when you see it coming. "Circumstances" here refers to airplanes. "Adapting" means avoiding. The Shanghai-Songhu battle is now extremely fierce. When enemy planes attack or our planes sortie, passersby stop to look up or climb onto roofs to watch from afar. This spirit of adventure is admirable, but it's likely that stray bullets will cause unnecessary sacrifice. It's really not necessary. Therefore, the four characters "adapt to circumstances" can be interpreted in a distorted way. Under the current conditions, with cannons and airplanes causing mass casualties, our lives are as insignificant as ants. They are not worth regretting, but it's better to sacrifice oneself in the trenches on the front lines than to sacrifice oneself in the streets or on rooftops while watching. It's more worthwhile to be killed while fighting the enemy than to be killed while watching. The sacrifice would be the same, but the value would be different.

### Painful Memories (8)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shudi

㊇ Flight

Those who are able to flee from slavery are luckier than those who endure the lives of slaves!

I had originally planned to come south at the beginning of July. Afterwards, due to various reasons, I repeatedly delayed it, postponed it, ...(Everyone thought that although the situation was tense, we could still watch the wind. When it was unbearable, we would run.) However, suddenly, like a kite with a broken string, the ancient city was captured by the enemy! At this time, I was like a fly trapped in a glass house: bumping around everywhere.

I ran around outside all day, declaring that I had to leave this enemy's rear. I planned to escape in disguise along small roads, and I planned to crawl out through the sorghum fields, and I planned... When friends met, they all talked about escape methods, but in the end, they couldn't find a suitable one.

"I believe that your eagerness to leave this place is not just to escape!" My closest friend, Tao, said this to me several times to comfort me.

"I will definitely work hard to not let your kindness be in vain!" I said firmly.

On July 5th, the Beiping-Tianjin railway resumed service for the first day. I quickly bought a ticket from China Travel Service, planning to leave on the 6th. However -

"That's not appropriate," a relative of mine advised me. "If you don't inquire about a boat ticket, going to Tianjin to stay is more dangerous than staying here!"

The ticket was returned to the travel agency, and at the same time, I asked them to send a telegram to Tianjin to book a cabin to Shanghai. The telegram was relayed by radio, but there was no reply for a day or two. On the 8th, the radio was also cut off. Fortunately, there were many people in the same situation, so the travel agency decided to send someone to Tianjin to handle this matter specifically.

Within these few days, many of my friends left. I asked, "There's no way to get a boat ticket. Is it okay to waste time in Tianjin?"

The unanimous answer was: "Every step further is a step better."

The person from the travel agency returned from Tianjin. The answer to the many people surrounding him and asking for news was a series of shakes of the head and waves of the hand: "There's no way! There's no way! It's not even certain if there's a ship, and the tickets are even harder to get."

The remaining option was to "take every step further as a step better." Early in the morning on the 11th, I managed to buy a ticket at the travel agency from a crowd of people who were fighting as if they were in a melee. It goes without saying that I was covered in sweat after getting the ticket. Even a button on my shirt was squeezed off. I thought I was very early when I arrived at the station at five o'clock in the morning on the 13th. However, the station was already crowded with people. It was said that some people had been sleeping at the station for a day or two without being able to board the train. The platform tickets were not for sale. Only Mr. Tao saw me off. He hadn't slept all night to see me off, and arrived at the station at three o'clock. The train was scheduled to depart at seven o'clock, but it still hadn't left at nine o'clock. Mr. Tao and I paced back and forth on the platform dozens of times. All around us, coming and going, were enemy soldiers and Ronin. We didn't dare to say anything to each other; and we couldn't say anything, either. There was a feeling of wanting to vomit. To reduce this pain, I urged Mr. Tao to go back before the train left.

"Well, goodbye then!" Mr. Tao extended his hand.

"Goodbye! Goodbye!" I grasped his hand firmly.

We said "goodbye" to each other dozens of times with profound meaning. — My "goodbye" meant his coming south and the day we would stand on the same front.

In this dining car I was riding, even the tables were occupied. There were no seats. I had to stand. However, a few minutes before departure, a coolie-like man approached me: "Want a seat, sir? Three dollars."

"How about two dollars?" I bargained.

"That old lady over there," he pointed, "even spent five dollars."

Sitting down was even more uncomfortable: the people standing next to me were simply "meat screens," blocking every bit of air. The car was full of the stench of sweat. The Japanese soldiers guarding the car were standing right next to me. There was a very disgusting smell of sweat coming from these two short and wide fellows, who were covered in cumbersome steel, kettles, bayonets, etc., and constantly moving their bodies. This made me very vigilant: I desperately avoided touching any objects on their bodies. Because I saw with my own eyes: a passenger came in and bumped their kettle, apologized, apologized, and was still desperately choked on the neck by them with their hands. Another person brushed their shoulders when getting off the train and was kicked in the butt with a leather shoe, causing them to stagger more than ten feet away, and let out a cry of "Ouch". Sometimes, they leveled their guns, aimed them at people, loaded bullets into the chamber, and then jumped out one by one; whenever a bullet got stuck, they would scold "jiji gugu", while desperately patting the "bolt." If there were a "misfire", the people shot down by him would fall down together like a string of fish. Everyone in the car was worrying with trepidation about this tragedy that could happen at any moment. The number of times the train stopped along the way was uncountable, sometimes to let enemy troop trains pass, sometimes for inspection; sometimes the enemy stopped us for no reason. After stopping for a while, they ordered us to leave quickly. It is said that on this day, because there were too many people crowded on the train, which made inspection difficult, the number of inspections was less than in previous times. When the train passed Fengtai, Langfang, Yangcun! and other places, large groups of enemy troops who had collapsed from Nankou were sitting on both sides of the railway. Some didn't have hats, some had lost their bullet belts, and some even lost a shoe, walking back and forth on the gravel with one bare foot... The state of their disarray was imaginable.

The train arrived at Tianjin East Station at 7:30. The three-hour train journey had taken almost ten hours. However, it was the fastest record since the railway was opened. The train the day before had only arrived at twelve o'clock that night. There were more than a dozen enemy soldiers standing opposite each other at the station exit, with their guns clamped under their armpits and with bayonets fixed. The passengers had to turn sideways and walk out of the station through the dense bayonet tips that were less than two feet apart. I was not inspected, but some people were inspected very strictly. I don't know what the criteria were. Maybe it depends on the looks? — I thought. I also thought: Well, what kind of looks require inspection? The look of a security team member? (Later, I heard that a few days ago, a traveler had already been checked and was about to leave the station when a gust of wind blew the bottom of his long robe, revealing a pair of yellow pants. As a result, he was shot in the back by an enemy soldier and died. At the time, no one understood why, but later they realized that it was probably because he was wearing pants like those of a security team member.) The look of someone who works for a central government agency? The look of someone from the cultural world? The look of a communist? The look of a Blue Shirt Society member... As I thought, I was secretly happy for myself: I probably dressed completely differently from the people in the above categories, so I was spared the inspection. I was very happy to sit on a rickshaw and walk on the road... Just as I was happy, someone suddenly shouted from the roadside.

A "friendly soldier" ran over, pointing to my box. I hurriedly put on a smiling face, opened the box and asked him to look. He rummaged through it, and it was all clothes; and apart from that, there was nothing else. He waved his hand, and roared at the rickshaw puller in words I didn't understand. The meaning was probably to tell him to get lost quickly.

When the rickshaw pulled up to the French Bridge, it was already under martial law, and I couldn't enter the French Concession. I got off and wanted to call my friend. To get a pass to come and pick me up. However, after borrowing from several places, I learned that all the power lines had been cut off by the Japanese army. I had no choice but to prepare to spend the night temporarily on the banks of the French Bridge, like the other hundreds of fellow refugees.

That night, the banks of the French Bridge in Tianjin were filled with the cries of children and the moans of the sick. Japanese military vehicles, however, continued to rush back and forth from nearby; when passing this place, they slowed down and slowly moved the flashlights, shining on people.

At a little after nine o'clock, a torrential rain suddenly fell. In an instant, the refugee crowd on the banks of the French Bridge presented a miserable scene of wailing and struggling. My box was floating on the water surface. My shoes were filled with water. Every time I moved, the water would splash and make a "squishing" sound. My body was wet and shivering, but it wasn't cold. A French concession policeman on guard told me that it was dangerous to spend the night like that: first, the Japanese soldiers might shoot at the refugees; second, getting wet all night could cause problems. "Well, what can I do?" I asked. So, he told me to wait near the bridge and take a foreigner's car later. Sure enough, after a while, he stopped a car that was passing by and muttered a few words, telling me to pay five dollars, and then he let me take my box and get into the car. Judging from his face and figure, the driver was probably a Russian. When the car reached the entrance in front of the French Bridge, a French policeman came forward to take a look. The Russian driver stuck his head out of the car window for a moment, and then drove past without any obstruction.

My friend Li's house only had five or six rooms upstairs and downstairs. At this time, it was occupied by four or five families who had fled from Beiping. My impression was that there were people everywhere. When I frowned and asked Li if there were any hotels nearby, he immediately understood what I meant and laughed: "Haha, I know you think it's too crowded here. But every hotel in this concession is full, and even the space under the stairs is occupied by people." That night, I had to sleep on the floor temporarily.

The ship was a big problem. There were probably eighty or ninety thousand people staying in Tianjin waiting for a ship. The most popular ships were naturally those of the British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire companies; however, only occasional ships were announced to be setting sail. Tickets had sold out ten days in advance. In addition, there were two unlicensed pirate ships that might sail, but the dates were also uncertain. I asked people everywhere to help me find a ship ticket. As long as someone was willing to transfer it, I would be willing to pay several times the price. In the end, I found a ticket to Yantai on a pirate ship. The original price was one and a half yuan, the original buyer spent eight and a half yuan, but the price they gave me was twenty-four yuan.

Li did not agree with me doing this. First, it was a ship that smuggled goods, the captain was Japanese, and riding it was too risky; second, the sailing date was unknown! But I thought: precisely because it was a smuggling ship, it might be safer; and secondly, I would leave whenever it sailed, because there was no other way anyway. — To be honest, I didn't have much hope of being able to leave on this ship.

However, fortunately, the ship sailed on the fourth day and safely brought me to Yantai. Apart from being threatened and shouted at by the Japanese soldiers on the warships several times after Dagu and Tanggu, and the ship being too crowded, I was quite satisfied.

In a total of six days, I arrived in Yantai from Beiping. When they heard the name of the ship I was on, my friends in Yantai stuck out their tongues, thinking that I had taken too much risk; but after calculating the date for me, they all said that I had travelled faster.

When I was breathing the air of freedom, I couldn't help but miss the city of Beiping and the people inside who hadn't escaped. (9, 14, in Shanghai)

Wuxi and Jiangyin Native Place Associations

The Wuxi and Jiangyin Native Place Associations jointly established four shelters. The Association hired the Zhenji to send refugees back to their hometowns. It has already sent out more than 32,000 refugees. Recently, the Xiexing Company also sent out more than 2,000 people. There are still more than 400 refugees in various shelters. It is said that all the refugees will be sent back to their hometowns, so as to end the operation.

Jishenghui Shelter

The Shanghai Chinese Jishenghui independently operates the Society's No. 1 Shelter at Yufo Temple on Pinlang Road, and the Society's No. 2 Shelter at the Daodong Girls' School on Aiwengyi Road. A total of 2,325 refugees were registered in the Yufo Temple from August 15th to September 15th. It is a cyclical process to avoid overcrowding. Of these, 1,447 refugees have been sent to Guangdong, Jiangsu, Nanjing, Anhui, Hefei and 20 other counties in batches. There are still 878 refugees. In the Daodong Girls' School, a total of 723 refugees were registered from August 14th to September 15th. Of these, 360 refugees have been sent to Guangdong, Yangzhou, Ningbo, Yin County and 5 counties in Shanghai. There are still 363 people. It is found that the Society's two shelters have successively accommodated more than 3,000 people. More than 1,700 people have been sent away in batches, and more than 1,200 people remain in the two shelters. It is a great problem that the shelters are full and insufficient.

Repatriation of Dinghai Refugees

The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai sent out more than 1,000 refugees on the Xinde Ferry the day before yesterday. There are still more than 3,000 refugees in the shelter. The lease term of the Maler Ferry has expired. After negotiations between the Dinghai Native Place Association and the Ferry, the Ferry sent Dinghai refugees back to their hometowns yesterday. In the future, refugees from eastern Zhejiang will be transported by inland river or land.

The second time was in August, when a total of 1,415.80 national currency units were collected. Aside from transferring 1,000 national currency units to the Military Affairs Commission for discretionary use in comforting troops, 1,500 burlap sacks worth 200 national currency units, 2 military telephones worth 145 national currency units, and 4 bicycles worth 140 national currency units were purchased and sent to the front lines for use.

### A Planet in the Japanese Political World: "Kazushige Ugaki" (Part 2)

— Fei Dan

As for Ugaki's relationship with political parties, it is naturally closer because he has served as the Minister of the Army in five cabinets and has had more contact with party members. Moreover, when he was the Minister of the Army, it was when Japanese party politics was quite powerful, and he was indeed influenced by political parties quite a bit. Therefore, he is relatively politically astute. But if civil servant party members can become Prime Ministers, then why can't military men with ties to political parties become Prime Ministers? Of course, the reasons are not sufficient. In reality, Ugaki's political skills are too sharp. Under his wing, there are truly strategists like clouds. If Ugaki comes to power, young military officers are in danger of being suppressed. This is the reason why they resolutely oppose Ugaki.

As for the size of Ugaki's sphere of influence, it is truly astonishing and unparalleled in Japan. His influence is pervasive in the financial world, political world, military world, bureaucracy, and the press. In every aspect, there are elements that support Ugaki. As soon as there is a ripple in the political situation, financial tycoons will come out to pay for activities, military men will exert their strength on his behalf, newspapers and magazines will promote him, politicians and party members will connect him with various parties, and bureaucrats will support him. In an instant, the entire machinery will be mobilized. But all efforts cannot match the guns of young military officers because their guns have assassinated financial tycoons Junnosuke Inoue and Takuma Dan, stained Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi and Inukai Tsuyoshi's official residence with blood, and started an incident in Tokyo, killing Takahashi Korekiyo, Saito Makoto, Watanabe Jotaro, etc. This cannot but cause people to worry. Therefore, no matter how great Ugaki's influence is, he cannot always get his way.

It goes without saying that the elder statesman Saionji and the group of senior statesmen valued Ugaki. Now, for the sake of clarity, the main figures from various circles associated with Ugaki are listed below:

Military side: Jiro Minami, Harushige Nomiya, Juichi Terauchi, Nobuyuki Abe, Hajime Sugiyama.

Political parties: Belonging to the Minseito party are Katsuki Kawasaki, Kojiro Tomita, Kyoichi Yamamichi, Jusho Koyama, Sachio Sakurauchi, Hideo Ikeda, Ryutaro Nagai, Kozo Makiyama, Fujimi Suzuki, Nagahisa Shimizu, Keikichi Yorita, etc. Belonging to the Seiyukai party are Shigemasa Sunada, Ichiro Kono, Tadahiko Okada, Ichiro Hoshijima, Teiichiro Yamamoto, Ichiro Hatoyama, etc. Belonging to the Social Masses Party are Kyu Ma, Kantaro Kamei; current independents such as Keisuke Mochizuki, Kiyoshi Akita, Mishen Koizumi, etc.

House of Peers: Nobumitsu Aoki, Naosuke Mizoguchi, Tadatoku Ishiguro, Yorina Arima from the Research Society; Takio Izawa, Iin Otokoyo, Daijiro Tagawa, Manabu Matsuki from the bureaucrat faction; and Fusajiro Abe, etc.

Financial circles: The main sources of political funds for Ugaki are the Kansai financial groups, including Masatsune Ogura of Sumitomo, Katsutaro Inayane of Nezu, Yatsukichi Ataka, Fusajiro Abe of the Toyo Spinning system, Bannan Atta, Kotaro Kato of the Kansai Trust system; Jun Noguchi of the Korean financial group; Kyohei Magoshi, Sunzaburo Ohara, Shinichiro Okazaki, Waichiro Hattori, Renzo Fujita, Kunizo Ozaki, etc. from the Okayama financial group; and figures from the Mitsubishi and Yasukawa groups.

As for the press, almost all those related to financial groups and political parties support Ugaki, so there is no need to elaborate.

Although Ugaki possesses such a vast amount of power, he still could not organize a cabinet as he wished. This clearly demonstrates the abnormal political state of the rampant young officers in the Japanese military. In the past, Japan's external wars could unify the country internally, but now Japan's external war is promoting internal divisions. The news of Ugaki's assassination, although unconfirmed, if true, Japan's political division in this war of aggression against us will inevitably come unexpectedly early. Under military actions, Japan may have a temporary possibility of military dictatorship, but the result will only accelerate the collapse of the military clique's power.

### The Magnificent Proposal of the "Laozi Army"

— Hu Junfu

As the brave soldiers at the front lines fight bloody battles to kill the enemy, an aging man sits in his study, knitting his brows and writing poetry. How shameful! How sinful! Recently, I heard about Mr. Zhang Yichu's proposal for a "Laozi Army," how magnificent! Therefore, I compose three poems.

Precisely when the sky is collapsing and the earth is sinking, stifling voices and singing laments is foolish and stubborn. Brave sons can wash away shame by serving the country, and old fathers still deeply cherish the thought of a grand past.

Strive together to wield the sun-chasing spears, we shall certainly reorganize the old mountains and rivers. Supporting the frail and returning youth, uniting hearts and strength, such a spirit will never be worn down!

The difficult situation is unprecedented in ancient times, and the resourceful and extraordinary figures are also unique. Generally, they are all Arhats, having experienced hundreds of millions of great calamities.
