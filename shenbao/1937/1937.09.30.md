### Fierce Fighting on the Luodian-Liuhang Line Yesterday, the Prelude to the Great War to be Unveiled Again

The enemy attacked from the left and right wings of Luodian without success. The enemy invaded the northeast of Liuhang, and fierce fighting broke out between the two sides. The enemy troops advancing lightly in Jiangwan were severely damaged by our tanks. A fierce artillery battle took place on the Huangpu River, and the enemy's attempt to cross the river failed.

The enemy's fourth general offensive seems to have been launched. From Luodian to Liuhang, there were extremely fierce battles on the entire front line throughout the day and night yesterday. The enemy's suppressive fire was even more concentrated on Liuhang. The main force of the enemy was also concentrated at this point, attempting a central breakthrough. Luodian focused on containing our forces, repeatedly harassing with small units, and waiting for opportunities to erode. We had already seen through the enemy's cunning plan, and each line responded calmly. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and there was a general sense of disorientation in advancing and retreating. The front-line report received by this newspaper at 2:00 AM this morning is as follows: ㊀ At 8:00 AM yesterday, more than 30 enemy tanks advanced towards our positions in Xiwangzhai, Tangjiabang, Chenjiabang, and other places in the northeast of Liuhang, covering a large number of enemy infantry and cavalry to charge. We fought valiantly, and the shouts of killing shook the sky. Our defensive fortifications were once broken through, but soon reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack. The enemy could not withstand it and retreated. The intensity of the attack increased in the evening, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. ㊁ Yesterday afternoon, several enemy tanks attacked our positions in Xiqianzhai and Fanjiabao in the south of Luodian. Two of them were destroyed by our defending troops, and the enemy retreated in a panic. ㊂ The enemy mechanized units and cavalry gathered in the city center area, trying to spy on our Jiangwan front line. Several skirmishes have already occurred. At dawn yesterday, a small unit of the enemy attacked our Municipal Cemetery position and was driven back by our troops. ㊃ Near Zhouzhai on the north bank of the Wenzaobang, about a company of enemy soldiers was killed by our mortars. Currently, the enemy is deploying defenses along the Yanjiazhai on the south bank and the Hujiazhai line on the north bank, actively building fortifications, and confronting us across the river. ㊄ There were occasional rifle and machine gun sounds in Zhabei. The enemy infantry has never dared to leave the trenches and attack. ㊅ Last night, the enemy's heavy artillery bombarded our positions near Dachang, with nearly a thousand shells in a few hours. Our positions were not damaged in the slightest.

### Enemy Troops Fiercely Attacked the Luodian Line from the Left and Right Wings

Our brave soldiers rose up to fight back. The enemy suffered countless casualties and was extremely embarrassed. Our artillery destroyed many enemy tanks.

The enemy's fourth general offensive seems to have begun. In the Luodian area, the fighting was quite fierce the day before yesterday. The enemy troops attacked simultaneously from the left and right wings. The left wing, northwest of Luodian, took Shixianggong Temple as its target, while the right wing concentrated its forces in the Caijiazhai and Zhangjiazhai areas in the southeast of Luodian town, east of the Hutai Highway. This area is east of Dijing. The night before last, the enemy launched a fierce attack with small units. More than ten enemy planes were active in the air, carrying out heavy bombing. More than a hundred artillery pieces concentrated their fire on our positions in that area, covering their infantry's advance. Tanks were also in the front row, covering the charge. Our army had already made full preparations. In addition to immediately returning fire with artillery, our forward infantry troops responded calmly. Many tanks were destroyed by our artillery. Our brave soldiers all jumped out of the trenches and pounced on the enemy. The enemy troops suffered countless casualties, and few survived. After midnight, the enemy received reinforcements and launched a second fierce attack. Our army held firm and did not retreat. In the end, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated. At dawn yesterday, the enemy's ambition did not die, and they launched a third attack, with fierce fighting. They retreated at noon. Last night, fierce fighting continued on the left and right wings of Luodian.

The Enemy in the Northwest Collapsed and Fled in Disarray

The enemy at Changqiao and Fengzhai in the northwest of Luodian, at about 2:00 AM yesterday (29th), harassed our positions in Caowangmiao, Pujiamiao, and other areas with small units. Our army initially ignored them and remained hidden in the trenches. The enemy thought our army was unprepared and brazenly attacked. Our army waited for them to approach and then swept them with machine guns. The enemy tried to escape in a panic, and the situation was extremely embarrassing. Our army saw that the enemy had been repelled and continued to defend the position, without pursuing them. The enemy did not dare to attack again.

The Enemy's Attempt to Build a Bridge Was Repelled by Us

In the Luodian area, the enemy, starting the night before last (28th), used artillery to cover more than a hundred enemy soldiers, carrying a large amount of wood, to the river surface east of Jiangjiazhai, attempting to build a pontoon bridge to attack our position. Our army initially ignored them. When they started to build the bridge, we immediately aimed and bombarded them with concentrated artillery fire. The enemy was unable to gain a foothold and retreated resentfully. When our artillery fire stopped slightly, the enemy tried to advance again. In addition to continuing to bombard them with heavy artillery, our defending troops also fired machine guns across the river. The enemy's attempt completely failed. By yesterday morning, they had retreated to their original position.

Enemy Artillery Bombarded Shixianggong Temple

The enemy troops fighting in the Luodian to Liuhe area, although they repeatedly attacked, were repelled by our army. The enemy's attempt seems to pay special attention to our stronghold at Shixianggong Temple. In recent days, the enemy has been bombarding it with fierce artillery fire from time to time, firing no less than 500 rounds every day. At 9:00 PM last night, the enemy even bombarded our positions there with volley fire. The flashes of fire could be seen, and the sound shook the distance. It only became slightly less frequent at about 2:00 AM yesterday morning. However, at about 8:00 AM yesterday (29th), six enemy planes flew to the sky above that area, circling and spying, and directing the enemy artillery to continue firing at our positions. Then the sound of artillery resumed. Our garrison immediately fired with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns. The enemy planes rose high into the clouds, but seemed reluctant to leave, and dropped several large bombs. Because their bombing had no target, our fortifications were not damaged at all.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy has been fiercely bombarding our army's warning line in the Luodian area for several days. From the south of Luodian town to Tangji, along the Hutai Highway, the fortifications on a line of about 1.5 kilometers in length were slightly damaged. Our army immediately built fortifications west of the highway to prevent the enemy from attacking. South of Tangwan, our army still guards the Hutai Highway, and the front line has not changed. The Central News Agency also said that the enemy south of Luodian attacked the Xiqianzhai and Fanziqiao areas with many tanks the day before yesterday afternoon. They once broke into our warning line. Our army waited for them to approach and concentrated on bombing them with hand grenades and small steel cannons. Two enemy vehicles were destroyed by us, and many infantrymen were also killed. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy collapsed and fled in a panic.

### Enemy Troops in Jiangwan Bombard Dachang

According to the Central News Agency, in the Jiangwan area, the enemy's field artillery suddenly fired continuously at our army's positions in Dachang yesterday. At the same time, many enemy planes dropped bombs and bombed the area. However, our army's fortifications were not damaged.

### The Enemy at Gujiazhai in Liuhang Suffered Heavy Losses and Was Forced to Retreat

The enemy's fortifications were all destroyed by our artillery. The enemy attacked Xiwangzhai, and fierce fighting lasted all day.

The enemy at Gujiazhai in the southeast of Liuhang was building fortifications in Yangjiufang the night before last. This place was close to our warning line. To prevent our army from attacking, the enemy frequently fired artillery at our Hutai Highway area, covering small teams of infantry who were constantly harassing. Our army firmly defended the front line and was unmoved. However, they ordered the rear artillery to concentrate their bombing. Not many shells were fired, but they all hit the target. The enemy's fortifications were all destroyed, and many enemy soldiers who were working were also killed or injured. The enemy suffered heavy losses and has retreated backwards.

On the Liuhang line, artillery bombardment was particularly fierce all day yesterday. Our artillery also returned fire. Many enemy planes were very active in Liuhang yesterday, conducting reconnaissance and dropping bombs. Due to the fierce artillery battle, the villages between Yanghang and Liuhang were all on fire, spreading widely. The extent of the losses is unclear.

The night before last, ten enemy tanks covered troops and attacked Xiwangzhai in the northeast of Liuhang. The enemy's momentum was extremely rampant and once broke through the barbed wire of our warning line and broke into our position. Our army responded calmly and attacked the infantry who were advancing with the tanks, preventing them from advancing. The enemy could not respond from front to back and quietly retreated. At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, they increased the number of tanks to thirty and attacked again. Fierce fighting lasted all day, but they did not succeed in the end.

### Fierce Fighting in Jiangwan Yesterday

The enemy at Sijing Ball Field in the Jiangwan area attacked our Hejiaxiang warning line yesterday morning, and a skirmish broke out. It lasted for half a day. After noon, it became even more intense. At about 5:00 PM, our machine gun team, under the cover of tanks, suddenly launched an attack from the front. The enemy responded in a panic. After holding out for an hour and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, they retreated to their original defenses. In the evening, the enemy's field artillery in the city center area frequently fired at the Tiyuhui Road area, covering the movement of the enemy troops in the city center area. The enemy troops have been moving busily for the past two days, and it is expected that they will launch a large-scale attack within days.

### Enemy Troops Advance North of Wenzaobang

The enemy troops in the Wenzaobang area have now advanced to the Yanjiawan and Hujiazhai areas and are building fortifications. This place is about three kilometers west of the Hutai Highway and about two kilometers south of Miaohang. Our army's warning line is very close to the enemy's, and we have also built solid fortifications and are on strict alert. The day before yesterday afternoon, a company of enemy soldiers from Zhouzhai on the north bank of the Wenzaobang was transferred to garrison the area. They were fiercely attacked by our mortars, and the enemy troops seem to have been completely wiped out.

### Fierce Artillery Battle Between Us and the Enemy Shook the Entire City

The Enemy's Two Attempts to Cross the River by Stealth Failed. Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Bombed, Causing Many Casualties to People and Animals.

The enemy's fourth general offensive seems to have begun. Fearing that our troops stationed in Pudong would take the opportunity to attack their rear, they have not given up their attempt to land. Enemy planes have been constantly conducting reconnaissance and dropping bombs in that area for several days. Suddenly, starting yesterday morning, they bombarded the area with artillery, resulting in a fierce artillery battle. The peaceful atmosphere in the Huangpu River for the past half month suddenly became tense. Enemy boats also attempted to cross the river by stealth twice, but both failed.

The Initial Artillery Battle Shook the Entire City

Before dawn yesterday morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River suddenly fired and bombarded the area behind the Lan Nidu Rich Qing Company Wharf in Pudong. Our army did not return fire at first. At about 4:30 AM, our heavy artillery on the ×× side made a loud noise that shook the distance, marking the beginning of a fierce artillery battle. At that time, the Chinese and foreign residents of the entire city were still asleep and were awakened in shock. Then our artillery in Pudong began to return fire. For a time, the rumbling sound continued like a drum roll. At about 5:00 AM, the enemy artillery in Yangshupu also fired more than twenty shells one after another, landing in the Yangjiadu area. Ten minutes later, they changed their target and bombarded the Changqiao and Liuliqiao areas. The houses in Changqiao were destroyed and caught fire. At the same time, our artillery also hit the enemy's Yangshupu positions with many shells, which exploded on the ground, emitting yellow smoke. At that time, three enemy boats, fully loaded with enemy soldiers, sailed towards Lujiazui and Qichang Wharf, attempting to land. We swept them with machine guns. After holding out for about ten minutes, the enemy boats could not withstand it and retreated.

Enemy Planes Wreaked Havoc, Causing Casualties to People and Animals

At 6:00 AM, when it was dawn, three enemy planes flew over to conduct reconnaissance. Our artillery stopped firing, and the enemy's artillery fire also subsided. A round of artillery battle temporarily came to an end. Then the atrocities of the enemy planes began. Seeing dense villages or moving people and animals, they dropped bombs. This lasted for two hours. Many villagers were killed. According to a post-incident investigation, Tangqiao District was the sole target of the enemy planes. It was reported that four shells hit Weijiazhai, killing and injuring seven people and one cow each, and destroying five houses. One shell hit a village house in Tangqiao Town, killing all twelve members of the family. One shell hit Zhengjiawan, destroying the house and causing a fire. One shell each hit Yangjiaqiao, Hujia Muqiao, and Zhangjiazhai, causing minor damage. One shell hit Shengjiazhai and landed in the fields without exploding. At the same time, enemy planes also indiscriminately strafed with machine guns, and stray bullets flew everywhere. The number of deaths and injuries is still under investigation. In Zhengjiawan, eight shells killed and injured three civilians each.

Two Fierce Battles Failed to Achieve Landing

At 4:30 PM, the fierce battle started again. The enemy's artillery in Yangshupu and enemy warships in the Huangpu River took turns firing, intermittently. Three enemy planes were still circling and spying. At the time, three enemy motorboats, each carrying more than ten enemy soldiers, slowly sailed towards Lujiazui in Pudong, seemingly targeting the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory there. They were again attempting to forcibly land. Our army had made early preparations. When they sailed closer, machine guns fired in unison, and the enemy boats retreated urgently. However, the enemy's artillery continued to bombard. Two shells landed in front of the Dongjiadu Puyuan Middle School. Fortunately, there were no ships passing by, so no one was injured. At about 5:00 PM, it became quiet. Our artillery remained patient and did not move. At about 7:00 PM in the evening, our army finally displayed its power and fired several shells in a row. The enemy warships were almost hit. The enemy was panicked and returned fire several times before stopping. A fierce battle came to an end. The enemy's two attempts to invade both failed, and they only wasted a lot of ammunition.

### Enemy Planes Dropped Bombs in Zhabei Yesterday

At 5:00 AM yesterday morning, in the faint dawn light, five enemy planes were spotted in the sky above Zhabei. One was a reconnaissance plane circling at high altitude, while the other four were bombers, taking turns flying low and dropping bombs. Their target was the area around the Oriental Library on Qingshan Road. From 7:00 AM, the number of enemy planes increased to more than twenty, divided into small teams, taking turns dropping bombs. Our defending troops frequently fired with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns. The enemy planes did not dare to fly low and randomly dropped bombs from high altitude, mostly falling in the Xibaoxing Road area. Our losses are unclear. Our losses are unclear. At 1:30 PM, enemy planes again dropped bombs in the air above our army's positions in Zhabei. Their target was still the ruins of the Oriental Library in Baoshan Road. At 3:30 PM, a team of enemy soldiers advanced along the Henghama River towards our Baoshan Road Bridge. However, the enemy was extremely cowardly. Once our army launched an attack, they fled in disarray. The outposts of both sides there were only 50 meters apart. We held firmly to each intersection and have never changed since the start of the Shanghai battle. The enemy has harassed us no less than dozens of times, but all have been repelled by us. They have also attempted to invade with small boats from the Henghama River. Our army defended the bridge surface and fired from above, killing many enemies. The enemy's plans have been exhausted. Since the day before yesterday, they have concentrated aircraft to bomb the area, hoping to destroy our fortifications and intimidate our army into retreating. They have wasted a lot of ammunition, but our army remains unmoved, and our fortifications are also extremely solid. This kind of attempt will definitely not achieve its purpose.

### Our Attack on the Patriotic Girls' School Enemy Position

Yesterday morning (29th), we used a portion of our troops to launch a feigned attack from two directions, the Guangdong Dong Middle School and the Chih Tze University, towards the enemy's position at the Patriotic Girls' School, in order to disrupt the enemy's formation. After our machine guns fiercely swept the area, the enemy hid in the trenches and did not dare to attack, only sending out tanks to try to resist stubbornly. After holding out for about an hour and a half, the sky was already slightly bright, and our army retreated to defend the position. Since occupying the Patriotic Girls' School, the enemy has been attacked by us from time to time and has been alarmed several times a day. Therefore, it now seems that they will abandon that place.

### More Than 7,000 Enemy Reinforcements Continue to Arrive

According to the Central News Agency, from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday, eight enemy transport ships arrived successively and berthed at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf, Huishan, Osaka, and Huangpu Wharves. Among them, the two enemy ships berthed at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf loaded with food and military supplies, while the other six enemy ships carried more than 7,000 enemy reinforcements and a large number of horses. Together with the enemy troops who landed at the Osaka Wharf and other wharves in Yangshupu the night before last (28th) at 7:00 PM, the total number of enemy reinforcements who have arrived in Shanghai in the past two days has increased by nearly 10,000.

The night before last (28th) at 7:00 PM, three enemy merchant ships sailed past Yangshupu and docked at the Huishan, Osaka, and Huangpu Wharves, carrying more than 2,000 enemy reinforcements. They all landed at about 4:30 AM yesterday morning, mostly cavalry.

### German Newspaper Upholds Justice and Condemns Enemy Atrocities

Cutting Off the Return Route of Overseas Chinese Without Declaring War, Still Making All Kinds of Difficulties in Allowing Transportation of Goods, Blaming the Killing of Fishermen on Not Knowing Submarines

The German-language Shanghai newspaper, Far Eastern News, published an article on the 28th of this month entitled "Only the Japanese Know": ㊀ Yesterday, the Japanese Navy spokesman met with news reporters to explain the bombing of the Yuehan Railway by Japanese planes on the 27th. He said that the US Ambassador to Nanjing had promised the Japanese side that European and American overseas Chinese in the Hankou area would completely evacuate before the 26th of this month. The Japanese side has paid great attention to and sympathized with the lives and property of the people of third countries, and has made extra concessions to allow the US Ambassador to extend the evacuation deadline for overseas Chinese, enduring it for three weeks, and then extending it for another 24 hours after the deadline to give European and American overseas Chinese the opportunity to evacuate. When a reporter asked, "Apart from the US Ambassador, has this matter been notified to the embassies and consulates of other countries by the US Ambassador, and what kind of notification method was used?" The Japanese spokesman was vague about this question. According to this speculation, only the Japanese side and the US Ambassador knew about the evacuation of European and American overseas Chinese in the Hankou area. Although the Japanese side is proud of its concern for European and American overseas Chinese in this matter, the result is that the return route of overseas Chinese from third countries has been cut off in a situation where war has not been formally declared. At the same time, the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy declared at the same press conference that the Japanese side would not be responsible for any safety regarding the passage of overseas Chinese from various countries through the Yuehan Railway when they evacuated. ㊁ The Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai allowed European and American merchants to go to the Hongkou godowns to pick up goods from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 26th and 27th, but each foreign firm had to formally request a pass and other procedures. As a result, it was not until 10:00 AM that they were allowed to enter the Waibaidu Bridge, and traffic was cut off again at 3:30 PM. Moreover, many trucks of a certain merchant were unable to pass. In short, it depends on the mood of the Japanese Navy Marine Corps to pass. Since China and Japan have not formally declared war, overseas Chinese from various countries have the right to weigh their property and goods, and the Japanese side has no right to interfere at all. How can there be a so-called right to make concessions? ㊂ The giant Far Eastern liner Xianghuo Situo of the North German Company witnessed a tragedy in the waters of Hong Kong yesterday that no one in the world had ever imagined (referring to the Japanese submarine attacking Chinese fishing boats). It immediately rescued ten people. All the fishing boats were sunk by Japanese submarines. Not only did they not save the fishermen, women, and children, but they also did not send them ashore. The Japanese Navy spokesman replied that he had not heard of this news, and did not express surprise or astonishment. He also claimed that he did not know whether there were Japanese submarines in the South China Sea. It is incomprehensible and regrettable that we find it incomprehensible and regrettable that the Japanese naval authorities, known for their organization and training, are completely unaware of the location of their affiliated fleet.

Some people explain that these types of fishing boats were secretly laying mines, so they were attacked. However, the captain of the Xianghuo Situo personally witnessed a fisherman's wife being injured by a shell and struggling for help on the sea. This factual proof does not seem to be concealed by sophists. (Translator's note: The Shanghai German Far Eastern News has always been very cautious in its descriptions. Now, with the Japanese people's various actions being too bizarre, it seems that they feel that "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." They have to speak out of righteousness.)

### A Child in Guangzhou Goes North to Join the Army

Parents, Brothers, and Sisters All Died at the Hands of the Enemy, Following Their Will to Go to the Front Line to Kill the Enemy

[Guangzhou] This reporter went to Zhengjia Ancestral Hall on the 19th to investigate bombed civilian houses and met a boy named Zheng, about twelve years old, who asked the reporter where he could take a bus north.

### Han Fuqu Puts Down Rumors

External Rumors are Far From the Truth, The Enemy's Provocation is Extremely Hateful

[Jinan] Today, Han Fuqu issued a written statement saying: Yesterday, foreign newspapers reported that the Japanese Doihara Kenji had come to Jinan to negotiate the autonomy of five provinces, etc. Such unfounded rumors are not worth the laugh of the knowledgeable. This war of resistance by our country is the only way for China to strive for survival. All our soldiers have the inescapable responsibility to protect the country and defend the people. I hold an important military and political position and will resist the enemy and defend against insults, strictly follow the orders of the central government, and obey the guidance of the supreme military leader. The enemy seeks to use its divisive tactics at this time to provoke discord and confuse rumors, which is extremely hateful. I deeply hope that the people of the country and friendly countries will not fall for the tricks and not believe the rumors, then the country will be fortunate. (29th Special Dispatch)

### The Enemy Planes' Wanton Bombing in Hankou Caused Great Displeasure Among Foreign Nationals

### British and American Public Opinion Condemns Japanese Atrocities

Strongly Advocate Applying Economic Pressure

[London] The Archbishop of Canterbury, England, will preside over the Albert Hall Conference on October 5th. The conference was initiated by the News Chronicle with the purpose of protesting Japan's declaration of war on civilians, and plans to request the British government to convene all civilized countries to take joint steps to stop the war. The parliamentary correspondent of The Times predicts that after Parliament reconvenes at the beginning of next month, a formal debate on foreign policy issues will be held, and says that Labor Party members are now more concerned about the situation in China than they are about the situation in Europe. "Judging from the current attitude of legislators in general, economic sanctions against Japan will undoubtedly receive strong support." Furthermore, the famous British economist Keynes wrote to The Times today, strongly arguing that Britain, the United States, and other countries represented in Geneva should immediately warn Japan that if Japan does not change its behavior, all commercial relations should be severed immediately. Keynes also said that the effectiveness of this kind of threat is almost guaranteed. If the United States refuses to participate, we will naturally be helpless, but if we do not initiate this kind of active policy, we will hardly escape its condemnation. The Manchester Guardian stated that the automatic boycott of Japanese goods by the British and American people is a great manifestation of the power of public opinion. The sentiments of these democratic countries cannot be taken lightly. Even if Japan can conduct its war according to humanitarian regulations, Japan cannot increase the reason for the war or reduce its crime. The newspaper added that the League of Nations can identify the crime of Japan bombing undefended cities in China, which is somewhat satisfactory, but the responsibilities of the countries do not end with the passage of resolutions. Furthermore, the significant recovery of Chinese bonds yesterday is generally regarded as an example of expressing sympathy for China. The "Economic News" believes that the reason is that although the stock of Chinese bonds is lacking, demand continues unabated. A Reuters reporter learned that although the prices of Chinese bonds have been suppressed, the actual number sold is very small. Old bonds are very firm, and the situation of railway bonds is slightly inferior. Furthermore, when The Times discussed the attitude of the Soviet Union today, it did not believe that the Soviet Union would join the war. The newspaper said that the best way for the Soviet Union is to sit back and watch Japan weaken itself and fall into an inextricable position in China. The newspaper believed that the Soviet Union would provide China with military aid. The newspaper concluded, "Japan wants to insert a foot between China and Russia, it must defend a thousand miles of wilderness, which is really beyond Japan's ability." (China Film News Agency, 29th, Reuters Telegram)

[Moscow] The influential "Washington Post" commented today on the Japanese army's bombing of Chinese civilians, stating in brief: Japan wants to strike until China kneels, resulting in worldwide outrage. Although the number of Chinese non-combatants slaughtered is huge, Japan has gained far less than it has lost. Japan's large-scale use of terrorist tactics in densely populated cities is actually an open confession of its military incompetence. The newspaper also said that the most direct and effective way to stop the Japanese army, in addition to separate protests from various countries and joint condemnation by the 52 countries of the League of Nations, is for millions of customers around the world to boycott Japanese goods, and the words "Made in Japan" have begun to make people feel disgusted. (National Telegram, 28th)

### The League of Nations' Strong Condemnation of Japanese Atrocities Will Increase Its Prestige

If Economic Sanctions Are Implemented Against Japan, the United States Has Indicated Its Willingness to Participate in Cooperation

[Nanjing] The Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem of the League of Nations has resolved to solemnly condemn Japan's atrocities. According to diplomats, this resolution is only the initial expression of the international community's stern attitude towards aggressor countries. The League of Nations is about to invoke Article 17 of the Covenant to impose effective sanctions on Japan. The stern reprimands that Japan has received from various countries in the international community is one of the greatest achievements since the establishment of the League of Nations. The whole world is united in sympathy for our country's war of resistance. (29th Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting continued to telegram the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that the American people were extremely indignant at the Japanese planes' indiscriminate bombing of undefended cities in our country. Public opinion throughout the United States unanimously criticized Japan, and the US government deeply felt that its past calm attitude towards the Far East incident was not enough to curb the atrocities. It has gradually adopted active measures to deal with it. (29th Special Dispatch)

[London] News from Washington here said that Secretary of State Hull had declared that if the League of Nations decides to impose economic sanctions on Japan, the United States will cooperate. Political figures here believe that this measure by the US government can provide important assistance to the League of Nations. However, political figures believe that the joint boycott of Japanese goods by the United States and all countries in the world to protest Japan's bombing of non-combatants is much more effective than economic sanctions imposed on Japan by only one country or a few countries or the League of Nations. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas Telegram)

[Washington] The League of Nations' resolution condemning Japan has been endorsed in practice today by Secretary of State Hull. Although Hull did not express it directly, he stated that the United States had protested against the bombing of undefended civilian areas long ago. Hull said that in a protest note on the 22nd of this month, the US government told Japan that the large-scale bombing of civilian areas violated humanitarianism and that the United States would pay very close attention to any joint action in the future. However, all the news currently circulating in Geneva is not a precise suggestion and has not yet been submitted to the United States for consideration. At the same time, other officials of the State Department denied the rumors in Geneva that the United States had refused to participate in a meeting of countries related to the Pacific. The United States has not yet received this suggestion. As for whether to participate or not, it can be inferred from Hull's declaration on August 23, because Hull once said that the crisis in the Far East is related to all countries.

### Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Clarification

[Tokyo] When the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters from various countries at noon on the 29th regarding the League of Nations General Assembly's unanimous resolution condemning Japanese planes for bombing undefended cities in China, he read out a clarification. The original text was very long. Before the spokesman read it, a Reuters reporter, on the order of the head office, corrected the error made by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 27th regarding the Reuters Guangdong telegram of disapproval of the bombing of Guangzhou: ❶ The sender of the telegram was not the Chinese reporter, Mr. Lin, but the English reporter of the agency, Mr. Barrow. ❷ He was an eyewitness to the bombing. London did not correct the telegram. The clarification issued by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly had nothing to do with Japan and that Japan would never cooperate with the League of Nations.

### The League of Nations Prepares to Send a Health Team to China

To Help Prevent the Spread of Plague in War Zones, We Requested Medical Relief from the League of Nations

[Geneva] The League of Nations today prepared to send a health team to China to prevent epidemics such as cholera and typhoid fever, and requested financial assistance from the United States. The total cost is estimated at one million pesos. The plan is currently being drafted, and its nature is similar to that of the League of Nations' mission to Central Europe. Its personnel will consist of five doctors and public health professionals, who will work in five regions. (National Telegram, 29th)

[Geneva] At today's meeting of the Technical Cooperation Committee of the League of Nations, the Sino-Japanese War was again viewed with a tragic impression. China attached a memorandum to the committee, asking them to pay attention to China's current need for medical and health assistance and technical assistance. The memorandum stated that as a result of China's war against Japan, there was a great shortage of medical and health supplies, and there was a serious danger of the spread of cholera and smallpox. The Chinese government, while shouldering the responsibility of dealing with the overall situation, had to find ways to prevent epidemics in order to protect its neighbors, in order to prevent the spread of epidemics due to the movement of millions of people. Therefore, the Chinese government continued to request the League of Nations to assist. The League of Nations is now planning to donate 160,000 Chinese yuan.

The Tongzhou Rugao and other five counties of Jiangbei countrymen, the number of refugees accepted is very large. The last time the chartered ship sent away did not succeed. It has now been continued by the five countrymen association to find a way to hire Wuhu and Wuxue, two ships of the British merchant Taikoo company. At 5:30 AM yesterday morning, the first batch of more than 5,000 refugees were sent to the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession to board the ship. At that time, enemy warships were wantonly firing cannons in the Huangpu River, and stray bullets and iron shrapnel were flying everywhere. The refugees boarded the ship at risk.

We are encouraged and overjoyed, truly jumping for joy. We plan to send representatives to the front to present your esteemed self with a meritorious flag, commemorating your great achievements in killing the enemy. We respectfully await your reply to comfort our hearts. The Shanghai Student Wartime Service Corps and all the students of the Student Model Brigade respectfully send their greetings.

### Inspecting the Frontline Battlefield Amidst Intense Bombardment

Our Troops Hold Firm, Morale High; Enemy's Kurume Division Has Only a Thousand Men Left

In recent days, the enemy forces have been fiercely attacking our left-wing positions, especially in the areas of Shi Xiangong Temple and Cao Wang Temple. Their intention seems to be to implement a central breakthrough strategy. However, our troops are firmly defending their positions with extremely high morale, and the enemy has not been able to cross the boundary. A Central News Agency reporter went to the headquarters of the ×× Army late on the 28th to interview the × Division Commander. When the Division Commander went to the front line to command, the reporter accompanied him. At that time, the front line was in intense battle. In the dim moonlight, we could see the enemy's shells flying like lightning, as dense as a string of beads, mixed with the sounds of rifles and machine guns. According to the Division Commander, the enemy fired more than 500 shells a day at Shi Xiangong Temple alone. If we consider the entire front line, the amount is even more astonishing. However, our fortifications are very solid, with very little damage. As for our artillery fire, we aim accurately, unlike the enemy's wastefulness. Our troops have been stationed in the defense area for more than a month, and although there has been no progress, there has been no retreat either. This is due to high morale, loyalty, and courageous fighting. The Division Commander then said that our troops had annihilated a part of the enemy forces in Jiang's residence and killed the enemy Captain Teramura. A diary was found on his body, which stated, "Our (that is, the captain himself) 11th Division has a bleak future. After a bitter battle with the Jiang's residence branch army (referring to our army), the casualties are too heavy. The Second Battalion is almost completely wiped out. Those who died in battle were cremated. Many soldiers are suffering from infectious diseases." According to reports, the enemy in Luodian has been replaced three times. The Kurume Division has suffered extremely heavy casualties, with only a thousand or so men remaining. As for our side, although there have also been heroic sacrifices, they are not even half of the enemy's casualties. When the reporter accompanied the Division Commander deep into the front line, seeing his spirit of courage and directness, the reporter felt sincere admiration. The road along the way was rugged, with many plank bridges and streams, but the Division Commander strode forward, not feeling any difficulty, as it had become a habit. It is said that in this kind of terrain, the enemy's heavy weapons, such as tanks, are really useless. After the Division Commander gave detailed instructions to the troops stationed in various places, he left the front line at midnight. On the way back, the Division Commander said that the enemy had greatly increased reinforcements in recent days and would launch a large-scale offensive again. He said, "Next time we meet, I will have some good news to tell you." The reporter listened attentively, greatly excited, and shook hands to say goodbye. After resting briefly at the military headquarters, the reporter returned to Shanghai in the evening breeze.

Current Commentary

### A Prelude to the League of Nations' Sanctions Against Japan

— Yu

The League of Nations General Assembly unanimously passed the resolution proposed by the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee on the 28th, condemning Japan's atrocities. The resolution severely condemned the Japanese military's bombing of Chinese cities and killing of Chinese civilians. When the resolution was passed, the audience applauded thunderously, and the enthusiasm of the emotions was unprecedented. This is something that makes us infinitely encouraged. Although this resolution is still limited to spiritual sanctions, at least the barbarity of the Japanese warlords is officially recognized by the world. Moreover, the current situation in Geneva may have better developments. As reported by foreign news agencies, the General Assembly has clearly condemned Japan without concealment and may propose suggestions to advocate for sanctions against Japan.

Even if the League of Nations General Assembly proposes various sanctions, whether they can be effectively implemented is still a question. But we at least cannot ignore its indirect influence. The Japanese warlords' atrocities have become a settled case in the League of Nations, which will clearly allow people around the world to gain a clearer understanding of the true face of our enemies. Coordinating this expression with the recent anti-Japanese sentiment spreading among the people of various countries can converge into a great force to maintain justice. Mr. Gu Weijun said in the Advisory Committee: "Even if the League of Nations cannot guarantee the rule of law to resist power, it can at least condemn the country that destroys the rule of law in front of all countries in the world. Even if the League of Nations cannot implement the principles of international law and international covenants, it can at least show that it has not abandoned these principles. Even if the League of Nations cannot prevent inhuman and illegal aerial bombing, it can at least publicly express its prestige to enhance the voice of civilized countries." If the League of Nations can do these things, it will be a serious blow to the aggressor country after all.

However, the extension of international justice still depends on our own support. The current improvement in the international situation is clearly the result of the heroic battles of our military and civilians with the oppressors for more than 40 days. After that, as long as we resist more strongly, it will not be a problem for us to obtain more practical international assistance.

### All Sectors in Britain Unanimously Condemn Japanese Atrocities

Boycott Movement Spreads Throughout the Country, Public Opinion Urges Countries to Cooperate

[London] The British boycott of Japanese goods movement has developed rapidly and has now spread throughout the country. Various important groups have actively promoted it. The British Citizens' Union first initiated the printing of slogans saying "This store does not sell Japanese goods" and distributed them to stores throughout London. People in various places have spontaneously responded and requested to cooperate with the union. The United Commercial Travelers' Association of the Midlands held a meeting in Birmingham yesterday and passed a resolution urging stores to boycott Japanese goods. People generally believe that if the boycott movement can be effectively supported by commercial travelers, it will be successful, and therefore attach great importance to the union's resolution. The ministers of various Free Churches in the London area recently held a luncheon meeting and decided to protest against "the Japanese aircraft bombing Chinese cities" and scheduled a rally at the Whitechapel Church on the 30th of this month to speak out for China. The Executive Committee of the South Wales Miners' Federation passed an important resolution in Cardiff today, stating, "This association, representing 120,000 members, deeply despises and hates Japan's invasion of China by force and the inhuman and barbaric means of killing Chinese women and children. Therefore, we request the National Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress to promptly contact the International Federation of Trade Unions and inform various countries, especially the labor groups in Europe, Australia, the United States, and Canada, to refuse to work for all kinds of goods and raw materials that are shipped to Japan or imported from Japan, and to launch a worldwide boycott movement against Japanese goods until the Japanese army withdraws from China." The association also sent copies of the resolution to Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, and Japanese Ambassador Yoshida Shigeru. In addition, there are two other matters that are particularly interesting. One is that the British Sports Association has proposed that when the 1940 Olympic Games are held in Japan, British athletes should refuse to participate. The other is that the manager of the "Black and White Dance Hall" in London, McEachern, originally planned to order 100 million straws for iced drinks from Japan. The contract had been signed, but he has now resolutely canceled it due to his dissatisfaction with Japan's atrocities against China. (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)

[London] Regarding the League of Nations General Assembly's condemnation of the Japanese air force, British newspapers have commented. The left-wing newspapers demand further action, while the right-wing newspapers publish letters from readers advocating a boycott of Japanese goods. Among them, The Times published a letter from the famous British economist Keynes (note: Keynes was in the Ministry of Finance during the European War and accompanied the former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George to plan economic issues during the Paris Peace Conference with the title of Deputy Finance Minister, with a distinguished reputation), stating that the United Kingdom, the United States, and other members of the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee should warn Japan that if it does not change its methods, the countries should cut off trade relations with it. If Japan retaliates, the countries should provide mutual assistance to deal with it. The Liberal News Chronicle continued to advocate a boycott of Japanese goods, stating that the United Kingdom should now announce to the world that any country that can do its best in this regard, the United Kingdom is willing to cooperate with it. The British government must also invite other countries to take joint action to stop Japan's atrocities. The newspaper also published a poster with a bomb drawn on it, with the words "This house does not sell Japanese goods", intending to sell it and allocate the proceeds to the Chinese relief agency. (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

### British Peace Movement Calls for Pressure on Japan

[London] The British Peace Building Movement Federation today sent letters to hundreds of churches of the religious organization and non-church readers, advocating a unanimous national condemnation of the Japanese military's "barbaric behavior" in China. The purpose of this movement is to put pressure on the government and seek the cooperation of the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to jointly protest to Japan and to "implement economic oppression when necessary." Furthermore, the Archbishop of Winchester said at the Diocesan Assembly today that Japan's "cold-blooded barbarism has bombed non-combatants and drowned fishermen at sea. Any country that calls itself civilized should unanimously condemn it." (Central News Agency, Reuters, 29th)

### British Labor Party Wants to Offer Strong Support

[London] The Labor Party Executive Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting from the 4th to the 9th of next month, at which time it will discuss the situation in the Far East, especially the atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China, and decide to request the parliament to reconvene on the 19th of next month to raise questions about the government's diplomatic policies. The atrocities of the Japanese army have aroused strong reactions in British public opinion. This has been deeply impressed by the Labor Party members who have arrived in Beijing from their constituencies. Some members regret that the United Kingdom has not advocated economic sanctions against Japan in Geneva. Generally speaking, the Labor Party will support the domestic boycott of Japanese goods movement. If employers refuse to participate in the boycott, the Labor Party and various trade unions may strike in order to achieve the purpose of the boycott. British law stipulates that workers in various industries may not strike except for matters relating to working conditions and the freedom to organize trade unions. Any strike movement of any nature is regarded as illegal, and those who participate in such strikes may not receive unemployment benefits. Political figures now believe that the Labor Party and various trade unions will only provide spiritual support to the boycott movement, but the party and unions have considerable power, and even spiritual support is sufficient to have a practical effect. (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)

### India Sympathizes with China and Launches Boycott of Japanese Goods

### Zhang Pengchun Speaks in England

Japanese Military's Willful Slaughter Accelerates China's Unity

[London] Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University in China was recently invited to give a speech by the League of Nations Association, stating, "The discipline of the Chinese army is surprisingly strict, which the enemy cannot have expected. I personally witnessed Japanese aircraft bombing, and the general public remained calm and surprised me. In short, the method of aerial attacks will never make the name of Nanjing disappear from the map. Japan originally wanted to end the war quickly, but now it has completely failed. The more Chinese people are slaughtered, the more united they become. The war can make China a unified country, which is what we are fortunate for. We firmly believe that as a result of the war, China will become a free China, and the Japanese people may also be freed from the shackles of the country's warlords, which is what we hope for." (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

[London] Dr. Zhang Pengchun has arrived here from Geneva. His mission is to present the situation of the Sino-Japanese war he witnessed to the Western public and to draw their attention to the important issues involved, so the affairs are extremely complicated. Today, Zhang will give a speech at the London Free Church Federation, which is the central organ of non-national religious groups in the United Kingdom, so it is extremely important. Tomorrow is the opening of the "Great China Movement". Zhang will attend and deliver a speech. Among those who will participate in the speech on that day are Sir Angell, a famous British writer and lecturer, Professor Laski of Political Science at the University of London, and Miss Gu Xiuzhen, daughter of Ambassador Gu Weijun. Zhang has also scheduled to speak at the Labor Party annual meeting to be held in Bournemouth on October 4. In addition, many important figures from all walks of life have scheduled talks with Zhang. After Zhang completes his mission in the UK, he will take a ship to the United States on October 6 and return to the UK to mediate everything when the British Parliament reopens. Zhang told a Reuters reporter today that the unbreakable unity of the Chinese people and the strong confidence of China will eventually defeat Japan's militarism. However, after a long period of resistance, China's financial resources will be exhausted, so it is feared that it will not be beneficial to other countries for several years.

### "May Square" Grand Rally, Fascist Leaders Speak

Reiterating the Common Stand Against Bolshevism, Italian-German Cooperation Aims to Maintain European Balance

[Berlin] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler gave speeches to a large audience in "May Square" last night. In addition to the 500,000 who listened directly on the scene, there were more than one million people outside the square who listened to the broadcast. First, Propaganda Minister Goebbels briefly introduced them, and then Hitler took the stage to thunderous applause. His main points are as follows: ㊀ The significance of welcoming the Italian Prime Minister is twofold: (A) The Italian Prime Minister is a contemporary great man who creates history; (B) The Italian Prime Minister's visit to Germany is by no means an ordinary political visit, but a joint demonstration of two major countries with 150 million people. ㊁ The German nation only seeks independence and peace. ㊂ National Socialism is the product of the failure of liberal democracy. ㊃ Analysis of the German-Italian axis: (A) Same concepts; (B) Consistent actions; (C) Maintaining the balance of the European situation; (D) Preventing the westward invasion of the Communist Party. After Hitler finished speaking, the band played the Italian national anthem. Then Mussolini used German to deliver the following speech, explaining ㊀ This trip has no secret intentions. ㊁ The German-Italian axis does not resist other countries. ㊂ National Socialism and Fascism do not need to be promoted to foreign countries, but they will inevitably expand in the future because they are the natural result of the evolution of the political system. ㊃ Leader Hitler and I (the Italian Prime Minister calls himself) only hope for peace. Many international misunderstandings are caused by the failure to recognize the facts. ㊄ Fifty-two countries in Geneva decided to impose economic sanctions on Italy. Germany alone expressed its opposition. This friendship will never be forgotten. In the autumn of 1935, the German-Italian axis was created. As a result, the two countries' friendship was strengthened and European peace was enhanced. ㊅ Italian volunteers helped the Spanish National Army. The purpose was to save European culture and prevent the invasion of Bolshevism. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)

[Berlin] Today is Mussolini's last day in Berlin. The schedule has been arranged as follows: At 10:30 am, the Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ciano went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Linden Street to lay wreaths, and then jointly reviewed the 50,000 National Defense Army with the German leader. After the review, the two giants will dine together and have the last political talk. All other Italian guests will be entertained by Deputy Leader Hess. Then Hess will send Mussolini by car to the Lilt Station to take a special train back to Italy, and Deputy Leader Hess will accompany him to the German-Austrian border. (Haitong Telegram, 29th)

### Registration for Returned Students from Japan to Serve

Deadline Before Double Tenth Festival, The First Batch Will Go to Beijing

The Shanghai Branch of the Returned Students from Japan Service Registration Office has been operating on the first floor of the Pudong Building. Registration has been very enthusiastic. A reporter visited the person in charge of the office yesterday, who told the following information: ㊀ After the Returned Students from Japan Association of the Republic of China moved from Tokyo back to No. 3 Qiao'an Lane, Eight Lanes, Nanjing, it repeatedly requested the government to coordinate the service methods for returned students from Japan. The government had also seen this early on, so this office was established, intending to first concentrate the registration of returned students from Japan, then provide short-term training, and then distribute them to work in various places. ㊁ The service registration office is established in Nanjing, and branch offices are established in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Jinan, and Xi'an. There is a reception office in Nanjing, and all registered students can stay there and provide meals. ㊂ Although this office was established at the request of the Returned Students from Japan Association, it is actually purely presided over by the government. Work after training is not a problem, so it is completely different in nature from all other Returned Students from Japan organizations. ㊃ More than 100 people have registered in Shanghai, and the first batch of about 50 people is planned to report to Beijing immediately. The registration period will definitely end before the Double Tenth Festival (October 10th) and will not be extended. Students from all over must gather in Nanjing before October 15th to begin training.

Also, according to the Shanghai Branch of the Returned Students from Japan Service Registration Office, as of the 29th, more than 100 students had registered. However, a few procedures have not yet been completed. It is also heard that those who want to go to Beijing in the first batch must come to the office on the first floor of the Yidong Building this morning (30th) to discuss everything.

### Enemy Aircraft Impersonating Our National Insignia

Bombing Raid on Wuhu

According to the Central News Agency, several enemy aircraft flew to Wuhu to bomb it the day before yesterday. Yesterday, our spokesperson stated that, according to a telegram from the area, one aircraft with our air force insignia and national emblem painted on its wings first appeared that day. Our garrison did not notice anything amiss and allowed it to circle and reconnoiter in the airspace before leaving, leading in several bombers that dropped several bombs and then fled. The reporter notes that the enemy army, which is falsely lauded, has attacked Nanjing and Hangzhou for days, and many have been shot down by us. The enemy, at their wit's end, resorted to this low trick, repeatedly impersonating our air force insignia to carry out sneak attacks. This kind of petty thievery has aroused complaints in world opinion, and the prestige of a strong East Asian nation has been completely swept away.

### Red Cross Driver Wounded by Enemy Aircraft Bombing Dies

Team Members Discharged After Treatment

The Chinese Red Cross Society Emergency Sixth Team, organized by the August 13th National Salvation Association, was led by team leader He Huijun with team members Zhang Ziyou, Xu Dingyi, and group leader Tu Zhongming, and was traveling by car to the front line to work on the 13th of this month when they were bombed by Japanese aircraft near Xiao Baziqiao, resulting in Tu, Xu, Zhang, and driver Du Liansheng all being wounded. Afterwards, the Chinese Red Cross Society sent the injured to the Sino-Western Sanatorium for treatment. Tu, Zhang, and Xu were discharged one after another because their injuries were minor, but driver Du Liansheng died yesterday at 10:00 AM due to a abdominal wound, despite the hospital's best efforts to save him.

### Management of Vegetable Cattle Transport, Registration Deadline Set

▲Deadline is October 5th

The city's Cattle and Sheep Industry Association, in order to prevent vegetable cattle from aiding the enemy, is organizing the management of their transport and yesterday issued another notice setting a registration deadline. It also stated that, in order to prevent the industry from aiding the enemy with vegetable cattle, the association drafted wartime management and transport methods for vegetable cattle, which were submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and scheduled to be implemented on September 16th. The methods have been distributed to the industry for compliance, and members have been asked to register with the association, and a public notice has been published in the newspaper. However, it has been found that some members and those who sell beef in addition to vegetables and game have not completed the registration procedures and are operating privately, which is inappropriate. In order to seriously manage and eliminate aiding the enemy, the association's management committee has resolved to extend the registration deadline to October 5th. All members who have not registered must register with the association before the deadline. If they fail to comply after the deadline, the association will handle the matter in accordance with item 10 of the management methods and request the authorities to crack down. Those who have already registered are asked to come to the association immediately to pick up their registration certificates. It is hoped that our colleagues will pay attention to this matter.

It is reported that arrangements have been made and he will soon transfer to a certain location to make deployments.

### The Inside Story of the Asia Sound Radio Donation Case Has Been Ascertained

Singers and Performers Have No Involvement, Radio Station's Books and Records Are Being Inspected

The Asia Sound Radio Station on Beile Road in this city has been embroiled in a scandal over donations. In addition to summoning the station owner for questioning, the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Committee is also conducting a thorough investigation. The inside story has been ascertained by the authorities. This incident was entirely initiated by the owner of the radio station, and all the funds handled were collected by the radio station. The singers and performers who were invited to broadcast and participate in the reports had no involvement whatsoever. Therefore, all responsibility has been assumed by the radio station, which has apologized to the performers and published a statement in the newspaper to clear up misunderstandings. According to news from the Municipal Propaganda Committee and the broadcasting industry, the Asia Sound Radio Station announced that the total amount of donations raised was over 19,000 yuan, which is considered not necessarily accurate or possibly more than that amount. The authorities are currently retrieving the radio station's books, records, and receipts for thorough investigation and the truth will be announced within days.

### Do Not Use Light Colors for Making Soldiers' Cotton Vests

Eagerly Awaiting Large Donations of Cotton Quilts, New and Used Cotton is Also Needed

Since the Shanghai Comfort the Troops Committee launched the campaign to collect cotton vests, donations from all parties have been quite enthusiastic. However, one thing should be noted: the fabric used, whether for the face or lining, should be limited to the three colors of gray, cyan, and yellow. Other light colors are easily noticeable by the enemy, so please do not use them. In order to facilitate distribution, it is urgently hoped that the offices of each group army will instruct each division and brigade to register and report to the committee. In addition to distributing them in batches, they will also report daily to the Anti-Japanese Support Association, which will then report to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs for liaison. Furthermore, the committee believes that as the weather is getting colder, both the front-line and rear-area soldiers need cotton quilts. It is now hoped that each household will donate one quilt. If Shanghai has 400,000 families, 400,000 quilts can be obtained. The committee can also accept new and used cotton for re-quilting for use in making cotton quilts or cotton vests. Patriotic compatriots, please send them to Jingshian Temple on Guling Road, Zhouye Gongsuo on Beijing Road, the Shanghai Local Association at the Zhonghui Building, the Old Mianlizi Cotton Fabric Association, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on Yu Qiaqing Road.

### 'First Line' Bi-Weekly Publication

Recently, the Shanghai Feng Society, in view of the lack of publications in the domestic publishing industry that discuss the issue of youth national salvation work, has specially compiled and published a bi-weekly publication called 'First Line', which is published on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month. The first issue is scheduled to be published today and sells for only one cent per copy.

### What is the Enemy 'Trying to Do'?

Destroying the Purchasing Power of Customers, Such Losses are Difficult to Calculate

The English-language "China Press" reported that the British Chamber of Commerce monthly published an article in September entitled 'What is He Trying to Do?'. The article details the loss of life and property in the first five weeks of the Shanghai battle. From a commercial point of view, Japan has no benefit to gain from this war. In the future, when the war ends, they will inevitably seek to make up for the loss of life, property, and commerce suffered during the war. One point must be acknowledged: Japan has destroyed the purchasing power of its best customers. Due to the decrease in purchasing power, Japan's commerce will not be able to return to its original state for several years after the war. This kind of loss will far exceed the material losses suffered in the war, and as the scope of the war expands, the losses will increase daily. This is an unavoidable trend. However, there is one bright spot that is noteworthy, which is that Chinese unity is becoming stronger. After the end of the war, China will pay full attention to construction. This hope is very exciting. The article concludes that the Japanese military cabinet must stop the aggression, weigh the gains and losses, and then the overall situation can be clear and peace can be restored.

### Two Shells Flew Over the Suzhou Creek

Fortunately, Neither Shell Exploded, Otherwise the Consequences Would Have Been Unimaginable

Shell Pierces Balcony and Falls into Water Tank

Yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, the enemy in the Hongkou area suddenly bombarded the Jiashan Road area north of the International Settlement with heavy artillery, firing a barrage every minute, each barrage consisting of several rounds. For a moment, it sounded like a string of pearls. Then, two or three enemy aircraft appeared in the sky near the North Railway Station, dropping heavy bombs and opening machine guns to strafe downwards. The glass windows of the houses and residences along the roads near the North Railway Station were all rattled by the sound of the artillery and bombs, and some were shattered, causing residents north of the Suzhou Creek to wake up from their dreams. The brave ones climbed onto their roofs in the faint morning light to observe the battle situation. Some witnessed enemy aircraft frequently dropping bombs, but because they feared the accuracy of the anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns fired by our army, they flew very high, and the bombs they dropped were essentially shots in the dark. Although we did not suffer any losses, stray bullets fell everywhere. When the enemy aircraft strafed with machine guns, one machine gun bullet fell in the middle of the road outside Qing Sheng Lane on Qipu Road, opposite the First Special District Court. Fortunately, it was just dawn and there were few pedestrians, so no one was injured. Not long after, a piece of bomb shrapnel about five inches long flew from the north and landed on the balcony of No. 5 Qing Sheng Lane, but it did not damage any objects. Around 9:00 AM, a cannon shell shaped like a hot water bottle suddenly struck the roof of the Rong surname family at No. 4 Dong Puyi Lane, diagonally opposite Qing Sheng Lane, piercing it and falling into the cement balcony on the third floor, destroying a large hole in the balcony. The shell then fell through the hole into the water tank of a laundry next door, shattering both sides of the tank. Fortunately, the shell did not explode. When the British soldiers stationed at the First Special Court learned of this, they immediately dispatched soldiers to the laundry to retrieve the shell and inquired about whether stray bullets had fallen elsewhere in the northern district that morning.

A Hole Pierced Through the First Special Court

Yesterday (29th) at approximately 1:45 PM, a cannon shell shaped like a two-pound hot water bottle flew from the eastern sky and landed on the steps outside the main gate of the First Special District Court on Beisuzhou Road (the wall is the court's notice board), piercing a large hole in the wall about a foot from the ground. The shell then shot into the hole, but because there was another obstacle behind the wall, the shell was pushed back out of the original hole under the reverse impact, and fell onto the road in front of a cigarette and paper shop opposite the court. Although it had been repeatedly hit, fortunately it still did not explode, otherwise the nearby area would have been in unimaginable misery. At that time, the British troops stationed in the court immediately dispatched many soldiers to distribute themselves in front of the court and strictly guard the area. The patrol room also sent a large group of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to surround the area where the shells had fallen and temporarily cut off traffic to prevent pedestrians from approaching the area and risking danger. At 2:15 PM, the guard force arrived and managed to move the shell away.

### Seamen's Party Department Congratulates Jin Army on Victory

The Special Department of the Chinese Seamen's Party sent a telegram saying: "Director Yan Bai Chuan of Taiyuan, Congratulations. In the past, the enemy seized Tianzhen and Datong, penetrating the waist of Jin and Sui, and the whole country frowned. Recently, the enemy was defeated at Lingqiu and Guangling, with more than 8,000 captured or killed, causing the main force of the Japanese army to collide. Your loyalty to the country and divine calculations are admirable, and the hearts of the people of the country have been relieved. From now on, the situation in the northern battlefield will improve, and it can be predicted that Youxian will be erected directly. In the Shanghai battle, we occupy a very advantageous position. Attached is a note from Yang Hu, a special commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Special Training Party, leading the national seamen to express their gratitude."

### Results of the Relief Association's Radio Fundraising

A Total of Over 13,600 Yuan, Still Hoping for Continued Donations of Funds and Medicines

Due to the intense warfare and expanded scope of work, the Shanghai Relief Committee is now required to send more wounded soldiers to the rear, which requires vast amounts of funds. Since the war will not stop for a day, the relief work cannot be stopped, so we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life can contribute funds, medicine, and equipment to make the relief work sustainable. In order to expand fundraising, the association was enthusiastically supported by the United Association of Performing Arts and the Broadcasting Industry Association on the 6th of this month, and invited famous actors and performers such as Mei Lanfang, Qilin Tong, and Hua Huilin to volunteer their performances at the Fuxing Radio Station to solicit donations. People from all walks of life donated very enthusiastically. After receiving telephone notifications, the association immediately asked the Boy Scouts of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to collect the donations, which ended very successfully. After days of settlement, a total of cash, checks, gift certificates, passbooks, national salvation bonds, stocks, and other items worth more than 13,600 yuan were received. In addition, a large number of silver objects and ancient paintings were also donated and are currently being converted into cash. After all the settlements are completed, a thank-you notice will be published in the newspaper. However, the association's monthly expenses are at least 100,000 yuan, so we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to donate funds, equipment, and medicines.

### Gentry and Wealthy Citizens Take the Lead in Purchasing National Salvation Bonds

Citizens' Team, Gentry and Wealthy Group, Unanimously Agree to Subscribe, Real Estate Association Resolves to Donate One Month's Rent

The Shanghai Citizens' General Team of the National Salvation Bonds and the Gentry and Wealthy Group held a reception at the Pudong Building at 3:00 PM yesterday, inviting gentry and wealthy citizens. More than 100 people attended. First, the team leader, Mr. Du Yuesheng, gave a speech, fully explaining the purpose of raising national salvation bonds, hoping that the gentry and wealthy would subscribe more and encourage their relatives and friends to donate more. Saving the country is saving oneself. If everyone destroys their homes to relieve the country's difficulties, the final victory will belong to our country, and so on. Then, Deputy Team Leaders Wang Xiaolai and Qian Xinzhi successively gave speeches, all asking that with the national crisis so severe, we can only enthusiastically subscribe to save the dying country and fulfill our duties as citizens. In this war of resistance, we will never give up until we win. Next, General Affairs Director Huang Qianzhi quoted Empress Qi Wei's saying, "If the state is lost, where will the people be?" to warn everyone, and described the pain of being abused after the country is destroyed, believing that saving the country is not only saving the country, but also saving the family and saving oneself, and is a technique to revive the dead. The language was sincere and moving, and the listeners were all touched. After Team Leader Du gave a speech of thanks, the attendees unanimously received the donation book and were willing to pay within a short period of time. Some immediately determined the amount of the donation and paid it generously, and others came to the meeting on their own initiative to subscribe without being notified, and a kind of courage to save the country was revealed throughout the entire venue.

Resolution of the Real Estate Association

The Real Estate Industry Association of this city, in view of the urgent need to raise national salvation bonds, held a general meeting at the General Association Building on Shanxi Road the other day to discuss the association's efforts to raise national salvation bonds. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to request that all landlords in this city donate all the rent after September of this year to subscribe to national salvation bonds, and tenants can first pay the rent to the collection outlets for national salvation bonds, get a receipt, and then hand it over to the landlord as rent to exchange for the September rent ticket (the landlord should note "exchanged for national salvation bond receipt" on the ticket). In order to show the enthusiasm of all real estate landlords to serve the country, this measure will definitely be welcomed by all landlords. Subsequently, four methods were stipulated as follows: (1) All real estate landlords in this city should use one month's rent for September to subscribe to national salvation bonds; (2) The rent for September of this year should be paid by the tenant to the banks that collect national salvation bonds on behalf of the landlord, and the receipt of the bond payment should be handed over to the landlord in exchange for the September rent ticket (the landlord should note "national salvation bond receipt" on the ticket); (3) The name of the recipient of the bond receipt should be the name of the landlord. If the recipient is not the landlord, the landlord will not accept it and will still collect cash from the tenant; (4) Tenants should pay the bond payment on behalf of the landlord to the collecting bank before October 15th of this year. When paying, they should bring back the rent ticket for the previous month and ask the collecting bank to check the landlord's name on the ticket and the amount of monthly rent to fill in the receipt.

Yesterday's Donation Amount from the Business Community

The Shanghai Business Community Fundraising Team for National Salvation Bonds continued to report the following amounts raised by various industries yesterday: Sugar industry: 140,000 yuan; Timber industry: 41,170 yuan; Cotton industry (second batch): 35,800 yuan; Paper industry (third batch): 33,215 yuan; Coal industry (second batch): 11,345 yuan; Hotel industry: 5,000 yuan; Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries industry: 5,000 yuan; Rubber, Hardware, and Desk Industry: 500 yuan; Tobacco industry (third batch): 300 yuan. The total amount above is 273,330 yuan. In addition, after the Cotton Fabric Industry Association established a branch, it actively raised funds, and over 80,000 yuan has been deposited, and over 100,000 yuan is expected to be deposited. For those members who have not yet paid, team leader Ke Ganchen and deputy team leaders Xia Xianting, Wu Junhao, Zhu Mingqiu, Yan Rongsun, Zhang Huanqing, and others have formed groups to urge their colleagues to subscribe. As for the matter of using cloth as collateral, the headquarters will notify that the deadline will be set.

Efforts of the Women's Group

Since Madam Kong Song Lingling took office as the director of the Women's Group of the Shanghai Fundraising Team for National Salvation Bonds and led with enthusiasm, all the staff and branch leaders of the group have been very excited and worked even harder. Because women account for half of the country's population, the women's rights movement must be promoted to realize it effectively, and the national disaster should not be ignored. It is regrettable that there is no participation of educated women at home and abroad in the fundraising work. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to Chairman Song Ziwen of the General Association, requesting that our embassies and consulates abroad and the wives of the provincial and municipal government leaders organize women's fundraising groups locally to work together to promote it. In order to expand the scope of fundraising, the group also hired Qi Yiying, Lin Kecong, Lu Huimin, and other ladies as fundraising staff to carry out fundraising work separately. It is also reported that the group is scheduled to hold its fourth group affairs meeting at the Kong residence on West Einstein Road tomorrow (October 1st), and a notice has been issued.

Zhenjiang Compatriots Enthusiastically Fundraise

The Zhenjiang Compatriots Association held a meeting yesterday and decided to establish a Zhenjiang branch, recommending Wu Yunzhu as the team leader and Chen Guangfu as the deputy team leader. It was divided into 30 teams, divided into three groups A, B, and C, and each team was responsible for one group. The fundraising goal was 1,000 yuan for Group A, 75 yuan for Group B, and 45 yuan for Group C. The fundraising will begin today.

Suggestion for National Physicians to Subscribe to Bonds

Ma Wenwo, a member of the National Physicians Association of this city, suggested to the Shanghai National Medical Society and the National Physicians Association that each member use one day's consultation fees to buy national salvation bonds, roughly saying that there are currently about 2,000 national physicians in Shanghai, and if each person subscribes to at least 5 yuan, more than 10,000 yuan can be obtained. In addition, dozens of doctors in this city have daily consultation fees of more than 100 yuan, and hundreds of doctors have daily consultation fees of 20 to 30 yuan, so it is not difficult to raise a large sum of tens of thousands of yuan in one day.

### Zhenjiang Compatriots Actively Send Refugees

Organize Rescue Team to Go to the Front to Implement Rescue Work

Since the Zhenjiang County Shanghai Compatriots Relief Committee started its work, it has sent back more than 20,000 compatriots to their hometown. Recently, it has published advertisements and sent letters to various shelters and relief associations, asking them to send the refugees from the five counties to the committee for repatriation, because the committee now employs a large number of ships dedicated to repatriation. Yesterday, the Taikoo Xinjiang team arrived and loaded more than 200 compatriots from the five counties returning to the country. The Municipal Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau specially asked the committee to find a way to accommodate and repatriate them. They are now being accommodated and repatriated separately by the committee. It is also reported that the committee recently felt that rescue vehicles were needed on the front line, so it specially organized a rescue team to prepare to go to the front to implement rescue work. The person in charge of the team is team leader Chen Peide, deputy team leaders Jiang Huanlin, Tang Chuanghou, Zheng Xiecheng, etc. In addition, the committee also made hundreds of cotton vests and sent them to the front to comfort our soldiers who are resisting the enemy.

### Another Proof of the Enemy's Atrocities, Shooting and Wounding a Member of Our Rescue Team

Boy Scout Zheng Zhiqiang Seriously Wounded in the Left Lung, Red Cross Sends Ms. Guan to Take Care of Him

The third emergency rescue team of the Shanghai Rescue Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, led by team leader Lei Shude, departed for the front line at 7:55 AM yesterday (29th) as usual to teach and protect the wounded soldiers. The Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps also sent member Zheng Zhiqiang (Corps Certificate No. 767) to accompany the car. When the team arrived near Gujiazhai, it was spotted by the Japanese army, who indiscriminately opened fire, causing Boy Scout Zheng Zhiqiang to fall to the ground. He was carried onto the car by the team members, given first aid, and rushed to Tiren Hospital for treatment. Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross Society, heard the news and sent Ms. Guan Zugui, a teacher from the rescue training class of the association, to the hospital to take care of him. However, according to the doctor at the hospital, the boy scout's bullet entered from the left shoulder and exited from the right armpit, causing serious damage to the lungs, a lot of bleeding, and rapid breathing, which may endanger his life.

### Fierce Artillery Battles for Days, Enemy Attempts to Break Our Lines Fail

Enemy Two Regiments Almost Entirely Annihilated in the Battle of Yangjia Village. Yesterday, the Enemy Fiercely Attacked the Baoshan Road Area but was Repelled by Us. Enemy Aircraft Bomb Civilians in Pudong and Zhenru, Causing Terrible Casualties.

From last night to this morning, the rumbling of artillery fire has not ceased all night. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River have been firing at Pudong on one side, and attacking our Jiangwan, Miaoxing, Dachang, and other areas on the other. The enemy in Yangshupu is bombarding Zhabei, Maigen Road, and other places, hoping to break our defense line. Our artillery is also firing back separately. Observing the enemy's actions, their so-called fourth general offensive seems to have begun. The enemy plans to attack simultaneously on the Zhabei, Jiangwan, Liuhang, and northwest Luodian lines, attempting to break through our positions. Last night, the enemy at North Sichuan Road and Hongkou Park launched a fierce attack on our Baoshan Road area. The sound of rifles, machine guns, grenades, and mortars was as dense as a string of pearls. Our defenses were tight, and we gave the enemy a head-on blow, causing them to retreat. Major battles on all fronts will unfold in the coming days. In each general offensive, the enemy first uses aircraft and artillery for a three-dimensional and violent bombardment, attempting to destroy our fortifications, and then uses its main force to advance. However, our defense line is extremely strong, and the enemy's infantry is already very cowardly. With our morale high and our fortifications solid, they will inevitably suffer significant sacrifices.

On the evening of the 29th, the artillery fire at Liuhang and Yanghang was fierce and lasted for a long time without stopping. At 5:40, about three-quarters of a mile east of the Lujiazui Customs Lighthouse, two bombs fell. Enemy warships near the Nissin Mail Steamship Company pier at Lao Baitu fired on Pudong. From 6:00 PM last night to 6:00 AM this morning, the fighting was intense. The sounds of mortars, machine guns, and grenades could be heard all night. From 6:40 PM to 7:30 PM last night, our troops in Pudong exchanged fire with enemy warships. Shells fell in both the Huishan and Yulin districts. A mortar shell fell near Lane 250 of Bazi Road, hitting a house and immediately setting it on fire, destroying four houses. From 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM this morning, several fires broke out near the Jiangwan Racecourse. Artillery fire at Liuhang continued non-stop. Artillery fire was also occasionally heard near the Commercial Press factory on Baoshan Road. The sound of artillery fire from Yanghang was loud and incessant, not stopping until 10:00 AM. Near 10:00 AM, artillery fire broke out again near Qiujiang Road, that is, Zhouyuan on the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway line. At 9:15 AM, a bomb fell near the Pudong Electric Company.

### In the Battle of Yangjia Village, the Enemy Two Regiments Were Completely Annihilated

Only Three Soldiers Remained of the Three Companies of the Enemy Surrounded in Yaotai. Many Important Documents and Weapons Left Behind Were Captured.

In this battle of Yangjia Village, we completely defeated the Takahashi and Sato regiments belonging to the enemy's Shigetō detachment, almost to the point of total annihilation. According to prisoners of war, only three soldiers remained of the three companies (1, 4, and 8) of the enemy surrounded by us in Yaotai. Important documents, seals, etc. left behind were all neatly placed and hidden, and guns and ammunition were discarded all over the road or in the ditches. From this, one can see the enemy's panicked escape. According to the refugees there, it was witnessed that three wounded and one dead enemy mid-level officer were found, and we obtained a pair of riding boots belonging to Major Nakayama, which further proves the severity of their defeat. Important documents have been reported. We also found a diary of enemy Sergeant Takeda, the gist of which is as follows: (1) The enemy (Japanese army) is busy with guarding and lacks sleep; (2) Afraid of our night raids, they dare not sleep soundly all night; (3) Our army's resistance is unexpectedly strong and our attacks are skillful, and the sound of mortars is alarming; (4) The enemy has been cut off from supplies several times, relying only on biscuits and bread, and recently they have felt the lack of bread and tobacco, and the hardships of war have gradually increased; (5) They are homesick and hate the war.

### Enemy Attempts to Break Through Liuhang Right Wing, Shelling Yanjiawan and Gujiazhai

Heavy Artillery Fire Lasted for Five Hours. The Enemy Near Zhouzhai is Closely Monitored by Us.

Shen Shi News Agency reports that the enemy east of Liuhang has been heavily damaged by our army in recent days. Now the enemy has changed direction again, avoiding attacking us head-on and focusing on the right flank, hoping to cross the Yunzaobang near Yanjiawan and attack Sanhang, and then planning to break through the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, which would put our military operations in the Liuhang area in an unfavorable position. Therefore, since the 29th, enemy artillery and aircraft have been quite active in the area along this line. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy artillery positions near Yanghang launched a violent bombardment of our Gujiazhai town and other places. Many civilian houses nearby caught fire after being hit, and the artillery fire lasted for more than five hours and has not stopped slightly this morning. At the same time, large groups of enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Dozens of bombs fell on Dachang Town, and more than a dozen civilian houses were destroyed. Last night, about two companies of the enemy near Zhouzhai on the north bank of the Yunzaobang attempted to move, but were closely monitored by our guard line troops and bombarded with heavy artillery. The enemy was unable to move a step. This morning, more than a dozen enemy aircraft bombed near the area again. Our army has now deployed extremely solid fortifications in the area, and it is very difficult for the enemy to spy on us.

### Two Enemy Vehicles Were Destroyed by Us

The night before last, several enemy tanks covered their troops in an attack near our western front. After our army bravely intercepted them, two tanks were destroyed. Seeing no gap to enter, the enemy immediately retreated.

### Heavy Casualties Suffered by the Enemy in the Artillery Battles on Both Sides

Artillery battles raged all night along the Zhabei and Jiangwan lines. The enemy at Sijingqiu Field and the Patriotic Girls' School attacked several times but were repelled by us. Therefore, the explosion sounds of machine guns and grenades continued to be heard. This morning, the artillery fire was particularly dense. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River and the enemy in the downtown area of Yangshupu continuously carried out harassing fire on our entire Zhabei to Miaoxing line, causing several fires near the Jiangwan Racecourse. From the 29th to this morning, the war situation in Shanghai has almost completely fallen into a state of artillery battle. The booming sound continues throughout the night without a moment's pause. Even the houses in the Special Zone have been shaken by the sound of artillery fire. The intensity of the situation is unprecedented since the outbreak of the Shanghai war on August 13th. The total number of shells fired by our enemy armies has reached more than 3,000. However, because the enemy's army is disorganized and intends to threaten us, all the shells they fire are shots in the dark, so although the enemy fires more shells than us, there is no military loss to our army. On the contrary, the shells fired by our army are accurate and hit the target once fired. As a result, enemy positions, armories, airfields, and enemy warships in the Huangpu River in the Yangshupu area were hit quite a bit, giving the enemy a major blow and loss.

### Enemy's Attempt to Cross the Laiyi Ferry Fails

Since the enemy's Izumo flagship was damaged by our bombing again at dawn yesterday morning, they hate our Pudong positions to the bone. Starting at 5:00 PM yesterday evening, they joined forces with various ships on the Huangpu River to fire frantically on Pudong. Shells fell in fields everywhere. Our artillery positions immediately retaliated with heavy artillery, and the shells landed in the enemy's base areas in the Yangshupu area. Many shells also fell around the various ships on the Huangpu River, splashing waves. The enemy ships were shocked and moved to avoid being hit. The battle subsided at about 6:00 PM. At 7:30 PM, fierce artillery battles broke out again. Taking advantage of the fierce fighting, the enemy secretly dispatched 23 wooden rowboats from various ships at 8:00 PM, each carrying about 15 armed Japanese soldiers, a total of more than 300, equipped with machine guns and protected by steel plates, planning to break through the 16th Pier Pudong blockade line. When they arrived at the Pudong Youlong Wharf, they did not dare to move forward. They only dispatched two boats to the south to scout near the Laiyi Ferry. At that time, our guards at all ports were waiting in full force, and the situation on both sides was extremely tense. However, the Japanese boats never dared to approach Pudong. At 8:45 PM, they all sailed to the west side and escaped downstream. The artillery fire also stopped at 9:00 PM. The enemy's attempt to cross the river on a large scale was thwarted. Therefore, the entire line was silent until dawn. At about 9:00 AM this morning, there were only sporadic artillery battles on both sides, and there were no violent actions.

The enemy's small steamers and scows anchored on the Huangpu River at Lujiazui now only have one scow left. The two small steamers have sailed away to other places and are docked near the shore of the Chunjiang Wharf near the Huangpu River at Lujiazui. The enemy secretly moved three large rubber sheets, leaning against the ground on the shore, seemingly to spy on the situation in Pudong and listen to the sound of artillery fire. As for the scow, it is thought to be prepared for escape.

### Enemy Spies on Fusheng Road and are Repelled

Because the Japanese army's attempts to attack the various lines in Zhabei have failed in recent days, they have followed the old plan of the 128 Incident, attempting to break in from the Fusheng Road area and disrupt our Baoshan Road defense line. Our side had long anticipated that this would happen, so we had already deployed defenses there in detail. Yesterday morning, a team of Japanese soldiers attacked Fusheng Road, but after our defending soldiers fought bravely, they were repelled. Our army also charged to the Laobazi Road intersection before retreating to their original defense positions. In the afternoon, the Japanese army attacked again, but were repelled again. When our army pursued to the edge of the concession, they retreated again. Upon investigation, the area is a crossroads, with Laobazi Road on the east and west sides, Beijiangxi Road guarded by the British army on the south side, and Fusheng Road, the defense area of our army, on the north side. The defense line is extremely solid. Seeing that our army was already prepared, the enemy did not dare to attack again.

### Stray Bullets Fly Across the Northern District of the Concession

Yesterday, fierce artillery battles broke out between the enemy and us all day long, causing stray bullets to fly across the northern district of the concession. Fortunately, none of them exploded, and no major tragedies occurred. However, deaths and injuries were still unavoidable. The following is a summary of what has been verified: (1) A shell in the Old American Laundry at No. 176 North Zhejiang Road did not explode; (2) The wall of the Special Court guard room on North Zhejiang Road was hit by a shell, creating a huge hole. The shell then flew back and fell into the road, without exploding; (3) Zheng Shoulin, inside No. 25, Lane 428, Kenerghai Road, was killed by a bullet; (4) An old woman at No. 147 Kenerghai Road was injured by a bullet; (5) A stray bullet flew into Xiangxin Lane on Ayerjin Road without exploding, and no one was injured; (6) Li Youfu was injured in the shoulder by a machine gun bullet at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Beijing Road; (7) A stray bullet flew into No. 5 Qingsheng Lane on Qipu Road without injuring anyone.

### Huacao and Zhenru Bombed This Morning

At about 8:00 AM today, several enemy aircraft flew to the Huacao Town area in the Puzhao District west of Shanghai and dropped bombs, destroying only a few civilian houses and injuring several civilians. At about 10:00 AM, several enemy aircraft bombed Zhenru again, dropping many bombs, and the explosions were quite loud, but they all landed in the fields.

### Two Enemy Warships Sailed to Zhapu

Three enemy aircraft flew to Jiaxing the day before yesterday for reconnaissance, and one was shot down by our anti-aircraft guns. The fuselage was not damaged, but the two pilots had escaped. Yesterday, two enemy warships suddenly sailed to Zhapu and anchored there. Their intention is probably to rescue the two escaped pilots.

### Enemy Aircraft Bomb Pudong This Morning

Enemy Fires Dozens of Shells to Test Our Strength

At a little past 9:00 AM this morning, two enemy aircraft flew to the vicinity of the Third Bridge in Yangjiadu, Pudong, and dropped bombs, totaling two bombs, destroying one civilian house and injuring seven civilians, five men and two women. At about 7:00 AM this morning, three enemy aircraft flew to the Lujiazui area in Pudong and the Tangqiao area south of Zhangjiabang, dropping bombs. Many houses were damaged in the area behind Qichang Store in Lujiazui and in the villages east of Tangqiao, and more than a dozen civilians were killed or injured. In the Nanshi area, two enemy aircraft also flew to patrol and scout, and when they saw many people along the way, they opened fire with machine guns.

Shen Shi News Agency reports that at 5:00 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River first fired dozens of shells to bombard our Pudong area and then stopped, seemingly to test our strength. At that time, three enemy aircraft flew in the Huangpu River to scout in the Pudong area. Then, enemy warships started firing again, seemingly intending to use artillery fire as a trick to detect our artillery positions in Pudong. Therefore, our army did not retaliate. The enemy aircraft circled for several weeks without being able to scout and then flew away. At about 8:00 AM, several other enemy bombers went to Pudong again and dropped bombs near Lujiazui. Another aircraft dropped bombs in the southeast area of Pudong. They did not fly away until about 11:00 AM.

At 9:15 AM today, an enemy aircraft dropped bombs on civilians at the north end of Zhangjiabang Bridge on Pudong Avenue. At that time, two bombs were dropped in succession, one falling in the field without causing any damage, and the other falling on the avenue, killing five civilians and injuring six or seven others. One of them, a rickshaw puller named Mao Xianglang, died shortly after being rescued. Such brutal behavior by the enemy aircraft is extremely inhuman.

At about 7:20 AM this morning, three enemy aircraft also flew to patrol and scout over Nanshi. Before long, the aircraft flew back and forth at a low altitude at the Xin Puyu Hall on Guohuo Road, and then flew to Gaochang Temple for several laps before flying across the Huangpu River towards Pudong, carrying out indiscriminate bombing in the Bailianjing area from Yangsiqiao Town to Lan Nidu, totaling more than 20 bombs, with loud explosions. They did not escape until about 10:00 AM.

The Guanyin Nunnery east of Lijiapo Bang in Beiguan, Chuansha County, Pudong, with Caojia Road to its south, occupied an area of more than one mu around the temple base. It had been in ruins since the Ming Dynasty. Later, it was rebuilt with donations from well-known people and philanthropists in the city and looked brand new. Only two years later, it was tragically bombed by enemy aircraft in shifts the day before yesterday and yesterday, and many bombs were dropped, causing the entire temple to be destroyed. The surrounding residents' houses were also affected. A temple worker was injured severely on the spot as he was unable to escape. At the same time, in the Tangqiao District of Pudong (including Niqiangquan, Zhangjiabang, Weixiang, Shengjianong, and Liuliqiao and Bailianjing across the river from Longhua), many civilian houses and livestock were damaged from the night before last to this morning due to artillery fire, stray bullets, and enemy aircraft bombing. Therefore, the villagers could no longer live in the countryside. In the past two days, they have been fleeing to various villages in Nanhui with their elderly and young, traveling dozens of miles on the field paths. When enemy aircraft saw many refugees, they flew low and strafed, injuring many innocent civilians, and the situation was extremely tragic. The cruelty of the Japanese army is appalling.

### Enemy Warships Continue to Transport Military Supplies to Shanghai

Of the eight enemy transport ships that entered the Huangpu River yesterday, only one, Zhaoshang North Pier, is still docked, and the rest have sailed away. Last night and this morning (30th), four more enemy transport ships arrived and docked at Zhaoshang North Pier, Huishan, and Osaka Wharfs. The enemy soldiers on the four ships were busy moving large quantities of lead sheets, wood, and military supplies from the ships to Osaka and Gongpu Wharfs. In addition, the enemy gunboat parked at the New Mitsui Coal Wharf left the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon and is now parked at the old site, stealing a large amount of coal from the coal wharf and smuggling it to the gunboat.

### Ten Enemy Warships in the Huangpu River This Morning

This morning, there were a total of 20 enemy warships in the Huangpu River, docked as follows: Zhaoshang North Pier: Transport ships Guangde Maru and Jiagu Tuo Maru, one each; Mitsubishi Wharf: Destroyer No. 1, one; Huishan Wharf: Transport ship No. 104 Jrdus Maru, one; Osaka Wharf: Transport ships No. 26 Hakodate Maru and No. 104 Harada Maru, one each; New Mitsui Coal Wharf: Gunboat, one; Floating gunboats No. 31, No. 27, No. 20, No. 13, and No. 9, one each; Floating gunboats No. 11, two; Floating destroyers No. 15, No. 8, No. 7, No. 3, and No. 1, one each; Floating flagship Izumo No. 2, one. In total: 5 transport ships, 6 destroyers, 8 gunboats, and 1 Izumo flagship, totaling 20 ships.

### The League of Nations Condemns Japan, and the United States Expresses its Approval

The Advisory Committee Discusses the Establishment of a Subcommittee. The Scope of Authority Has Not Yet Been Determined.

[Geneva] The resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly's Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue the day before yesterday, condemning Japan's bombing of undefended Chinese cities, has been approved by the United States. However, regarding the issue of appointing a subcommittee composed of countries directly related to the Far East issue, the Advisory Committee has not reached a consensus on the scope of authority of the subcommittee and will continue to discuss it tomorrow. After the Advisory Committee meeting this month, Harrison, the U.S. observer, first declared, "The U.S. State Department has read the full text of the resolution passed by the Advisory Committee the day before yesterday regarding the bombing of undefended cities. The U.S. government has always considered this kind of bombing to be unjustified and in violation of international law and humanitarianism and has notified the Japanese government of this on several occasions." The representative of the Equatorial Country then spoke, stating that Japan violated the League of Nations Covenant and international conventions, and the League of Nations should at least condemn it in spirit. The French representative, then Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Tedson, said that since the Advisory Committee has quickly passed a resolution condemning the bombing of undefended cities, it is now time to submit the general situation in the Far East for discussion. He advocated the establishment of a subcommittee to discuss the situation in the Far East and report the results to the Advisory Committee. The British representative, then Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, declared that the British government would accept a suggestion made by Bruce, the representative of the Australian Federation, to convene a meeting of countries related to the Far East issue. He also said that the French representative Tedson's proposal to establish a subcommittee was also supported by France. He also said that the dispute between China and Japan is not only related to the parties involved, but also has an international nature and involves other countries. Therefore, continuous efforts must be made to end the war. The Chinese representative, Gu Zhengjun, requested that the Advisory Committee first fully recognize Japan as an aggressor before the subcommittee can study methods of implementing the resolution. At this point, the Advisory Committee held a debate on the scope of authority of the subcommittee. Lord Cranborne argued that the subcommittee should have general authority and could replace the Advisory Committee in the future. The Belgian Foreign Minister, Spaak, argued that the subcommittee should only prepare for the work of the Advisory Committee and should not replace it, so as not to reduce the prestige of the League of Nations, because world public opinion is now expecting the League of Nations to take strong action. After a long discussion, no results were achieved and it will be continued tomorrow. (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

[London] Regarding the convening of a conference of the countries most concerned with the Far East issue to discuss the Sino-Japanese conflict, British officials recently stated that the purpose of this conference, if it is convened, is to express the unity of the spirit of the countries so that Japan will have to take it into account, but it is not related to the boycott of Japanese goods movement advocated by the general public. This conference will not only include the United States, but also Germany and Italy will also be invited. If the participating countries can unanimously decide on the issue of restoring peace in the Far East in the future and mediate in good faith, then Japan does not seem to be able to refuse. Therefore, although the general public is now advocating a boycott of Japanese goods and advocating expanding it to serve as a backing for official peaceful mediation, those in charge have not endorsed it. (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

### Our Army on the Jinpu Line is Waiting for the Counterattack

A Regiment of Enemy Troops Arrives in Lianzhen. Our Troops are Reorganizing in Sangyuan. Support Troops are Continuously Moving North.

[Jinan] Last night, about a regiment of enemy troops arrived in Lianzhen, with a small number of cavalry and plainclothes teams. This morning, our armored vehicles arrived in Sangyuan. Our army was ordered to reorganize in Sangyuan in preparation for a counterattack. One shell fell east of the station. The enemy is about 15 miles from the station. Our support troops are continuously moving north. One enemy aircraft flew to scout. (31st Special Dispatch)

[Jinan] Because the Han traitors on the Jinpu line dug up the embankment on the east bank of the Grand Canal, the area north of Sangyuan is flooded everywhere, making it difficult for the army to march. Our army is concentrated in Anling Town, waiting for the counterattack, but our left and right wings still have strong forces that have not retreated. Today, enemy aircraft fled to Lianzhen and dropped bombs several times, causing no major damage. (29th Special Dispatch)

[Taiyuan] The front line sent a telegram at 12:00 PM on the 27th. A part of the enemy surrounded at Laoye Mountain broke through. The enemy also increased its troops by 3,000 and attacked Pingxingguan in a roundabout way. The fighting was fierce. The surrounded enemy refused to surrender. Today, enemies attacked Dashi Kou, Xiaoshi Kou, and Ruyue Kou. The fierce battle lasted for a day and night. (28th Special Dispatch)

### Yangping Appraisal Association Established

⊙Jiangdu: The Appraisal Committee of the Food and Fuel Regulation Branch was established on the 29th to prevent high prices of daily necessities. (29th Special Dispatch)

### Trivial Comments

— Appearance

The enemy uses troops against China. In North China and Shanghai, they mostly use puppet Manchukuo and Korean soldiers to take the lead. Behind them are machine guns, and in front of them are artillery fire lines. Advancing is certain death, and retreating is also death. This is the best lesson for docile people and soldiers. It is also the enemy's wonderful method of using Chinese to control Chinese.

The enemy has used troops in Shanghai this time, increasing its troops five or six times and fighting for more than 50 days, without achieving much victory. Therefore, they indiscriminately use aircraft and bombs to brutally kill our innocent civilians everywhere. This is the enemy's greatest skill in using troops.

The enemy's bombing of our innocent civilians has aroused the public anger of the world, who unanimously condemn them as a barbaric nation and the demons of the forest. Various movements to boycott Japanese goods and economic sanctions are brewing. This is the supreme honor the enemy has received.

Since the outbreak of the war, our country's losses have been countless, but the destruction of the enemy's factories, the stagnation of trade, the sacrifices of soldiers, aircraft, warships, etc., are the rewards the enemy has received for "seeking benevolence and getting benevolence."

### The Situation in Chao-Shan Under Enemy Naval and Air Raids

Citizens Scattered in Rural Areas, Commerce Declining

Shantou Correspondence: Seven enemy warships are anchored outside the port of Shantou, frequently moving to harass Shanwei and Aotou in Haifeng County and other places. No fewer than seventy or eighty cargo ships, salt ships, and fishing boats along the coast have been chased, captured, or sunk by enemy warships. They also seize the fishermen's clothes and catch, then inject the fishermen with medicine before releasing them. Since then, infectious diseases have broken out in Shantou, with cholera spreading rapidly. Seven people died in a single day. Among them, the Ji Guiji family had four deaths, and the Qi Lu Conglong family had three. Lin Qing, an eleven-year-old boy from Conglong Pengliao, and Gui Xiang, a seven-year-old girl, died within three hours of contracting the disease. This is in addition to the enemy's artillery fire and bombs, a separate and innovative germ warfare. On the 8th, 9th, and 10th of this month, three enemy planes, all taking off from enemy warships, attacked Shantou and Chao'an city twice daily, in the morning and afternoon. Only reconnaissance was conducted in various county towns and villages, with very little bombing. A total of more than thirty bombs were dropped in Shantou city, targeting hospitals and charitable organizations. The British Gospel Hospital was also bombed. It is clear that the enemy's cruel intentions involve destroying hospitals and relief efforts before launching germ warfare. More than ten bombs were also dropped in the Chao'an area, causing considerable damage inside and outside the city. British doctors at the Gospel Hospital in Shantou moved all their medicines to Jiaoshi to jointly manage rescue efforts with the American Yishi Hospital. British and American warships are currently anchored in Shantou port, advising foreign nationals in Chao-Shan to take refuge in Jiaoshi or move to Hong Kong, according to the instructions of their respective governments. The US Consul in Shantou boarded a warship on the 10th, but all the foreign nationals have no intention of leaving Shantou. Enemy warships outside Ma Yu frequently bombarded the Qi Lu coastline of Shantou. On the evening of the 9th, an enemy warship squadron used two small launches to tow many fishing boats and surrounded the entrance of Jin'ao, where they landed troops. More than two hundred enemy soldiers were killed by our ambushing troops. On the 10th, several more enemy warships near Nan'ao moved to Haifeng Shanwei, ostensibly to coordinate with enemy warships at the mouth of the Pearl River. From the 10th to the 12th, enemy planes continuously took off from the Zhao'an sea area and bombed Chenghai, Chao'an, Chu Fan Yang Gulong, and even Shaoguan. The Shantou lookout was bombed, and a gong was used as an air defense alarm. Once the alarm sounded, it was echoed everywhere to notify the citizens. Enemy planes flew low to the rooftops of Wing On Department Store on Xinma Road, strafing pedestrians. Because the Chao-Shan military did not send troops to engage the enemy, the enemy planes were so audacious. An enemy plane was shot down by our anti-aircraft guns and crashed into Lianhua Mountain in Yanzao, Chenghai. Both the plane and crew were completely burned. Another enemy plane crashed into the mud off the coast of Fenghuanggang, Haimen, Chaoyang. The pilot committed suicide after being injured. Since Shantou was invaded by the enemy, more than nine out of ten citizens have moved inland. All stores are closed for business. When Yisheng and Xin Haimen arrived in Shantou on the 10th, passengers felt deeply distressed because there were no hotel launches to meet them. There were no workers to unload the rice carried by the two ships. Major banks moved to Chao'an city. The Shantou municipal government retained a small number of staff for receiving and dispatching services. Workers at various newspapers resigned and returned to their hometowns. Four out of seven newspapers have ceased publication. The three remaining newspapers, Shantou Daily, Xinghua Daily, and Republic Daily, have reduced to publishing one page per day due to a lack of paper and ink. Newspaper distribution companies, which used to sell newspapers from Shanghai and Hong Kong, have almost completely stopped operating since the outbreak of the war with Australia, due to traffic disruptions and the difficulty of newspapers reaching Shantou, in addition to most of their former subscribers having left Shantou. The only external transportation route for Shantou is Hong Kong, which has not been completely blocked. Besides sending letters on ships, there is no other way to transmit news.

### Enemy Planes Attack Guangzhou Repeatedly

More Than Ten Villagers Killed and Injured Near Daliang in Shunde; Six Bombs Dropped in the Eastern Suburbs of Guangzhou, Causing Minor Damage

Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the enemy warship was damaged and fled from Humen to Lingdingyang, it has continued to harass the Guangdong coast. On the 16th, enemy planes appeared in the Leizhou and Qiongya sea areas. On the same day, they opened fire to bombard the Xiuying Fort in Haikou, Qiongzhou. Our artillery defense forces were already prepared and immediately returned fire. At night, fearing our planes bombing, the enemy warship eventually abandoned Haikou and left. It is reported that the enemy has dispatched additional aircraft carriers from the United States to the south. Our air force has sent planes to scout every day, preparing to launch a fierce attack. However, with several enemy warships coming south, enemy planes have also become active. For the past few days, enemy planes have flown to Humen and the Jiujiang-Guangzhou Railway area almost every night to spy and attempt to drop bombs. At about 10 p.m. on the 15th, six enemy planes flew from the eastern district to hover over Shenzhen Station on the Jiujiang-Guangzhou Railway, seemingly searching for bombing targets. Our air defense sentries detected them and immediately telegraphed Guangzhou to report. The air force station then dispatched two squadrons of planes, one to intercept and one to stand guard over Guangzhou. When our fighter planes arrived at Shilong Station, they encountered the enemy planes, which fled in panic to the east. Unexpectedly, another three enemy planes flew remotely over Guangzhou. They were dispersed by our guarding planes and flew west. When flying near Daliang Town in Shunde County, the enemy planes, assuming we had no defenses, dropped two bombs at places with ground lights. Both fell outside the northern suburbs of Daliang. One did not explode, and the other fell on the Shihu Yongxiang courier station silk factory, about one li outside the north gate of Shunde County. It exploded immediately, destroying four houses next to the Gangtou Temple, killing two farmers, two boys, and one girl, and injuring more than ten villagers. The bomb fell in the open space, creating a crater about nine feet deep and about two zhang wide. Based on the explosive force, it is estimated that the bomb dropped by the enemy plane weighed about 250 pounds. After dropping the bombs, the enemy plane flew east. On the evening of the 16th, seven enemy planes again flew to Guangzhou under the cover of dusk, including four fighter planes and three bombers. When the enemy fighter planes arrived in the eastern suburbs, our planes took off to defend and engaged the enemy planes in aerial combat, holding out for ten minutes. The enemy fighter planes feigned retreat, luring our planes to chase them above Shilong. The enemy bombers then used a trick to circle around to the southwest and sneak into the city, using our plane's symbols, emitting green lights, and flying low over the city at an altitude of no more than three thousand feet. Some citizens visually saw the three planes crossing the city, mistakenly believing them to be our own planes, and did not pay attention. The enemy bombers slowly turned from the southwest to the northeast and dropped four bombs over Baiyun, causing minor damage. When flying to Yantang, they dropped two bombs. After dropping the bombs, the enemy planes turned and fled east. After 8 p.m., our planes searched the area and, seeing no trace of the enemy, lifted the air raid alert. When enemy planes attacked, spies were discovered near the bombed institutions, launching rockets and fireballs as signals for the enemy planes to target. Dozens of people were arrested on the spot by military police and taken to the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters for interrogation, including several important civil servants. After the criminal proceedings, the authorities, in order to eliminate spies, pretended to issue an air raid alert at about 7 a.m. on the 18th, and first sent military police to conduct strict investigations. As a result, more than ten lower-level spy networks were captured. In order to prevent future spy activities, the Garrison Headquarters issued a notice on the 19th, prohibiting villagers from traveling outside the village at night, and stipulating that tea houses, opium dens, and public gathering places in the village should be subject to military police crackdowns, and village lights should be extinguished during air raid alerts. Violators will be arrested and prosecuted (September 19).

### Enemy Warships Invade Lianyungang

Bombarding Xugou Street with Artillery; Our Army Returns Fire, Enemy Ship Damaged

Haizhou Correspondence: Recently, enemy warships and planes have frequently come to Lianyungang, Haizhou, Xinpu, and other places to spy and bomb. However, because our defenses are solid, the enemy has not succeeded. At about 3 p.m. on the 23rd of this month, an enemy plane was spotted in the sea north of Ge Island in Xugou, Lianyungang. The plane first used artillery to test the waters, aiming at the north side of Xugou Street. Our defending army pretended to ignore it. The enemy plane, thinking we were unprepared, advanced and fired artillery. Unexpectedly, our army suddenly returned fire fiercely with artillery, hitting the target accurately. Two enemy planes were hit, and the chimney on the ship was destroyed. By 6 p.m., the enemy plane fled in panic. On our side, only one table and one stool in the station platform room were destroyed, and there were no other losses. The morale of our army is very high, and they are now holding their positions. The Qianhai Donglai Express train terminated at Xinpu Station on the 23rd.

### Public Debt Depository Ordered to Handle Delivery

Brokers Plead for Further Extension; Failed to Implement Yesterday Due to Deadline

The public debt forward trading previously decided by the Securities Exchange Brokers Association to request the Ministry of Finance to approve settlement at the limited price to clear the procedures. However, in order to maintain normal national debt investment and avoid future disputes arising from contracts, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Securities Exchange Authority to handle the delivery of forward sales expiring in September in accordance with the regulations. Upon hearing the news, the Brokers Association immediately convened a general meeting of all members. Due to the current situation, customers were scattered, and if delivery was handled, the burden on the brokers would be too heavy. It was decided to try to lobby the Ministry of Finance to request exemption from delivery and to continue to postpone the transaction of the period. However, the Ministry of Finance found it difficult to approve. However, a slight extension of the delivery period could be accommodated. However, the brokers still felt it difficult to cope with. At 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, another general meeting was held, but there was no proper solution. In the end, it was decided to have the chairman do his best to try to break the deadlock again. As a result, the place where it was difficult to notify the handling of delivery yesterday was not implemented. General observation, since the Ministry of Finance has ordered delivery, it is difficult to easily withdraw the order.

### YMCA Expands Services for Wounded Soldiers

Continues to Solicit Goods from All Circles

Liu Liangmo, a staff member of the National YMCA Military Service Department who was sent to serve at a certain war zone on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, returned to Shanghai yesterday. He said that the soldiers of our army are all short and stocky, brave and extraordinary. When going into battle to kill the enemy, they only advance and never retreat, so our army has made very smooth progress on the front line, while the enemy infantry is timid and unwilling to move forward, fearing hand-to-hand combat with our army, and bombing our positions aimlessly with aircraft and cannons every day, causing no damage to our army. The YMCA's service work on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, which is to establish wounded soldier clubs and officer clubs, has been very popular among the wounded and brave soldiers and combat officers. As the number of clubs has increased from four to more than ten, there is a shortage of materials. Therefore, Mr. Liu rushed back to Shanghai on behalf of the front-line soldiers to make a second request to the patriotic compatriots in Shanghai. The materials needed by the association are as follows: (1) The latest anti-Japanese publications and books, (2) pocket-sized gramophones, (3) national salvation songs and Peking opera and Cantonese opera records, (4) national defense books and newspapers, (5) national defense short stories, (6) national defense wall charts, (7) various chess pieces. People from all walks of life who wish to donate can donate to the YMCA in Baxianqiao, or the YMCA at No. 131, Museum Road. Mr. Liu will report to the Shanghai people on the situation on the battlefield and the latest work at 6 pm today at the Ministry of Communications Radio Station.
