### The Enemy's Repeated Attacks on Pudong Have Failed, Yesterday's Fierce Cannon Battle Shook the Whole City

Our Accurate Shooting Destroyed the Consulate and Damaged Enemy Warships / Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat at Wusong Drove the Enemy to the Riverbank / Enemy Forces Surrounded on All Sides at Luodian, Annihilation Imminent

Since the shifting of the battle lines outwards, Shanghai had been relatively quiet for the past week, with little sound of gunfire. However, yesterday's artillery battle on the Huangpu River broke the city's silence. The powerful sound of our artillery shocked the city, and the general public returned to a state of extreme tension and excitement, realizing that Shanghai was also on the front line. The situation on various battlefronts yesterday is summarized as follows: ㊀ The result of the artillery battle in Pudong: our artillerymen achieved accurate hits, with three shells hitting the Japanese consulate, causing significant damage. The stern of an enemy transport ship was also hit and damaged. In the evening, the enemy attempted to land secretly at Lan Ni Du, but they were immediately repelled by our defending forces. ㊁ On the Wusong front, the enemy suffered heavy losses due to the failure of their general offensive the day before. Yesterday, our forces took advantage of the victory and advanced steadily, forcing the enemy to retreat to the riverbank area. In addition, the enemy near the Da Zhonghua cotton mill attempted to break through Yangjiazhai yesterday, but they were met with concentrated machine gun fire and were forced to retreat. ㊂ The enemy forces in the Luodian area are still about two or three miles northeast of Luodian town, surrounded by our forces on all sides. Furthermore, over a thousand enemy troops on the east bank of Liu River were forced to retreat towards Chuansha on the afternoon of the 2nd. ㊃ From the morning of the 2nd until dusk, the enemy launched five or six attacks on our Sanguantang position, but all were repelled by our forces. ㊄ On the Yangshupu, Hongkou, and Jiangwan Road Baziqiao areas, both sides maintained their original lines without change.

### The Enemy Attempts to Invade Pudong, Fierce Artillery Battles on the Huangpu River All Day Yesterday

Since the focus of the war shifted to the various ports along the river and coast, the concessions have been very quiet, and the sound of heavy artillery has not been heard for ten days. However, since the enemy troops landed at various points along the river and coast, they have been repeatedly attacked by our forces and have had no chance to advance. Therefore, yesterday they resumed their attacks on our Pudong and bombarded it with naval artillery. Our forces also returned fire with heavy artillery, and the artillery battle lasted all day, its intensity unprecedented since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. Our artillery's targets were accurate and every shot counted. The Japanese consulate north of the Waibaidu Bridge was destroyed by our fire, and an enemy transport ship in the Huangpu River was heavily damaged. Other enemy ships were also greatly threatened. Many foreigners watched the battle from the rooftops of various foreign company buildings on the Bund, praising the accuracy of our artillery's targeting. The residents of the concessions were once again in a state of extreme excitement. The details are described separately below:

Enemy Troops Landing Were Annihilated by Our Forces

At approximately 10:10 AM yesterday, over a hundred enemy troops, divided among several small boats, attempted to land at the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, under the cover of enemy warship fire. Our troops stationed in Pudong immediately responded with dense machine gun fire and launched hand grenades at the enemy. The enemy, unable to gain a foothold, fought back in a panic and suffered heavy casualties. The fierce battle lasted until approximately 11:00 AM. All but a few of the landing enemy troops were annihilated, with only those who retreated to the small boats surviving. Subsequently, from 2:00 PM onwards, another four or five small boats, filled with enemy troops, cruised along the Huangpu River near Lujiazui, attempting to land again. Our forces waited for them to approach before opening fire with machine guns. Although the enemy troops also returned fire with machine guns, they were unable to land. Until the evening, the enemy boats were still cruising, but due to our strict defense, the enemy's attempt failed.

Further reports indicate that after the Japanese army's first attempt to land at Chunjiang Wharf failed, they sent a small motorboat in the afternoon, carrying approximately one hundred enemy troops disguised in civilian clothes, each carrying weapons and incendiary devices. They covered the soldiers in the boat with tarpaulins and secretly turned south towards Lujiazui from Yangshupu, taking advantage of the intense artillery battle. At the same time, a squadron of Japanese planes bombed Pudong. The boat secretly passed Lujiazui and headed towards the 16th Pier. At that time, it was 4:20 PM. This group of enemy plainclothesmen planned to sneak into Pudong at the 16th Pier, intending to cause trouble at Lan Ni Du and other places. However, just as the boat reached the Xinkai River on the Huangpu River, it was spotted by the American warship stationed there. The American warship immediately launched a sampan, sent some soldiers, and circled the Japanese military boat once, using flag signals to warn and prohibit this large group of plainclothesmen from landing secretly. The Japanese military boat, after being warned by the American warship, could not proceed to the 16th Pier in Nanshi and returned to Yangshupu on the same boat. The second attempt to land secretly again failed.

The Artillery Battle Was Fierce All Day

When the enemy troops landed at Lujiazui yesterday morning, the enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River immediately bombarded our Pudong with dense fire to provide cover. Our artillery positions also immediately returned fire with heavy artillery, concentrating on the enemy warships in the river and the enemy positions in Yangshupu. By noon, the enemy troops landing at Lujiazui had been almost completely annihilated by our forces, so they became furious. The enemy flagship Izumo immediately ordered all enemy warships in the river to concentrate their fire and bombard our Pudong. The bombardment was dense and continuous. In order to retaliate, our side fired mortars at the enemy positions in Hongkou. The enemy had no choice but to order two squadrons of enemy planes to fly to Pudong at around 2:00 PM to scout out our artillery positions in the hope of bombarding them. However, after the enemy planes circled over Pudong for about an hour, they did not find the location of our artillery positions. They only dropped a dozen or so bombs randomly and then left in frustration. After the enemy planes left, our artillery continued to fire, causing the enemy to panic. They hastily dispatched three of the newest Type 6 destroyers, originally anchored at Songkou, to the Huangpu River. They arrived at approximately 4:00 PM, anchored at the Japanese Mail Steamship Company wharf north of the Japanese Consulate General, and simultaneously opened fire on our Pudong. Our side also continued to return fire with heavy artillery. The sound of cannons thundered, and the whole city could hear it. The artillery battle between the two sides lasted all day, and the sound of the cannons gradually stopped at approximately 7:00 PM in the evening.

Another Attempt to Land at Lan Ni Du

At approximately 10:00 PM last night, enemy planes flew to Lan Ni Du in Pudong to bomb it. At the same time, four or five small boats filled with enemy troops sailed into the southern Huangpu River under cover of darkness and approached the blockade line on the Huangpu River at Lan Ni Du, attempting to land at the Dagu Wharf in Lan Ni Du under the cover of enemy planes. Our forces immediately responded with dense automatic rifle and machine gun fire. The enemy boats could not approach the wharf and were all bravely repelled by our forces. After approximately half an hour, the enemy troops, suffering heavy casualties, retreated in defeat. The attempted landing completely failed.

Our Artillery's Targets Were Accurate

Yesterday, our artillery's targets were exceptionally accurate. Initially, we used heavy artillery to bombard the enemy's positions in Yangshupu, and many places in the enemy's positions caught fire and suffered heavy damage. Subsequently, we bombarded the enemy's positions in Hongkou with mortars. Many shells landed in North Sichuan Road, Kunshan Road, Wusong Road, Zha Pu Road, Tiantong Road, and North Suzhou Road, causing heavy casualties and losses to the enemy. A total of more than ten shells landed in the vicinity of the Japanese Consulate General. The Japanese Consulate General was also hit by three shells, which immediately exploded, causing significant damage, and killing and wounding many people. Nishi Kiyoshi, the head of the police department, Matsushita Minoru, and Kawazoe Ichi, a reporter for the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, were all seriously injured. The Japanese side panicked and hastily evacuated important items from the Consulate General. At noon yesterday, two shells landed near the No. 2 buoy in the Huangpu River, only about twenty yards away from the enemy flagship Izumo. The water splashed high and reached the ship, causing the enemy to panic. From 4:40 PM to 5:00 PM in the afternoon, several more shells landed near the Japanese Mail Steamship Company wharf and exploded, very close to the enemy Type 6 destroyer. It was not possible to confirm whether the ship was damaged, but an enemy destroyer was docked at the Mail Steamship Company wharf and was hit in the stern at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, suffering heavy damage. Many enemy troops on board were also killed and wounded. In addition, another enemy Type 16 destroyer was also hit and damaged by our forces. As for the enemy's artillery fire, it was aimless and caused no losses to our side. Only the Hongxing Shipyard and the Xiangsheng Ship Repair Yard in Lujiazui, as well as the Dushan Wharf and the Qijiang Wharf, caught fire and burned fiercely. The fire started at 11:20 AM and had not been extinguished by night. Many salt boats docked at the Chunjiang Wharf were also burned.

Fierce Artillery Battles, Many Stray Bullets

The intensity of yesterday's artillery battle was truly unprecedented since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. There were many stray bullets in the public concessions and Nanshi. At 2:50 PM yesterday afternoon, a shell landed on the Bund on Beijing Road, killing three Chinese and wounding four. A Russian businessman and an Indian policeman were also injured. Also, at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when the artillery battle was at its fiercest, a small shell landed in front of the office of the Ewo Cotton Mill on the Bund of Beijing Road. Because the office was paying wages at the time, seven workers and twelve pedestrians were hit on the spot. Among them, only one worker, Xiao Mazi, aged twelve, died tragically, and the other eighteen people were sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. In addition, a foreign member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, an Indian policeman, and a Chinese policeman were also affected and sent to the Gongji Hospital for treatment. Other investigations of stray bullets in various places are as follows: ㊀ A stray anti-aircraft bullet landed in the Xiqiao Lane of Jing'an Temple Road, injuring six pedestrians (some say more than twenty were killed or injured). They were sent to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. ㊁ Also, the Deshunchang tobacco shop on Zhonghua Road in Nanshi was also hit by a stray bullet at approximately 2:00 PM, injuring the shop's mistress, who was sent to the hospital for treatment and is in critical condition. ㊂ The Taichang tobacco and paper shop at the Xiaoshidaoqiao intersection across from the Shanghai South District Firefighting Union Association on Zhonghua Road, Zhou Nanmen, Nanshi, was grazed by a shell fragment at noon yesterday, and the roof on the upper floor was destroyed on the spot. ㊃ A corner of a police station in that area was also destroyed. At that time, several pedestrians (including an old woman who was injured by falling tiles) were present. The Chinese and Western District ambulances sent the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. ㊄ A corner of the wall near the Wang Dayou incense shop near the Water God Pavilion was also destroyed. ㊅ Several sailboats moored on the Huangpu River in Lujiazui were hit by shells at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday and caught fire on the spot, turning to ashes. ㊆ When our army shelled the Japanese consulate and explosions occurred, due to the enormous force, an employee of a shop on the fifth floor of the Bank of China Building on Renji Road, Beijing Road, who was wiping the glass windows, was thrown out of the window by the force of the explosion and fell onto Renji Road, his brains splattering and dying tragically on the spot. ㊇ As for the Zha Pu Road Bridge and the Riverside Apartments on North Suzhou Road, which are close to the war zone, stray bullets also fell and exploded. ㊈ A power line near the Shi Jia Lane on South Warehouse Street in Nanshi was destroyed, injuring Wang Xiaobao, a 16-year-old resident of No. 17 Lane, who suffered a severe head injury. ㊉ In Pudong ××, two shells were fired, injuring Gao, the wife of Rong Zaichang, a Wuxi native residing in No. 2 (injured in the left breast, chest, and foot, which was severed), her relative Wang, and a girl, Wang Wende (just two years old). The relative Wang suffered a severe head injury, and the girl Wang Wende's father was also killed in the bombing at the same time, which was extremely tragic.

A Glimpse of the Start of the Fierce Artillery Battle

At approximately 9:30 AM yesterday, a small sampan in the Huangpu River, rowed by a woman and carrying five or six people resembling refugees, crossed the Huangpu River from the Beijing Road Wharf, intending to come to Shanghai and land at the New Customs Wharf. When it reached the center of the Huangpu River, it was suddenly opened up to machine gun fire by an enemy warship anchored in the river. In an instant, bullets flew like beads, and the refugees had no choice but to sit and wait for death. The enemy was still not satisfied and sent a small motorboat to the Chunjiang Wharf, attempting to land and investigate our military situation. It was repelled by our garrison. But not long after, the enemy drove another small steamship, carrying dozens of soldiers, and drove to Pudong again. It was still repulsed by our army head-on, and the enemy ship escaped in panic, and the enemy warship immediately used flat-fire guns to fire at Pudong. Many ships in the Huangpu River were hit. At the same time, a plane rose into the air to reconnoiter Pudong and send signals. At 10:10, the enemy's 16th destroyer, which was docked at the Nissin Company Wharf in Hongkou, aimed at Pudong and bombarded it, and our army immediately retaliated with artillery, thus igniting a fierce artillery battle.

### Hand-to-Hand Combat at Wusong Yesterday Morning

Enemy Artillery Fire Completely Lost Its Effectiveness / Pursuing the Enemy in Victory and Driving Them to the Riverbank

The enemy troops who retreated to Wusong Town launched another attack on the Tongji University North Sitang area at approximately 6:00 AM yesterday. Enemy warships first fired artillery to bombard the area, followed by an infantry charge. Our forces defended their fortified positions and were not moved by the enemy's artillery fire. When the enemy troops approached, they were met with machine gun and rifle fire. However, the enemy troops, determined to fight to the death, swarmed forward. Our forces became more courageous as they fought. With a shout of "kill," the soldiers all jumped out of the trenches, threw hand grenades at the enemy, and charged at the enemy with bayonets fixed, forming a heroic hand-to-hand combat. At this time, the enemy warships did not dare to bombard, and the artillery fire completely lost its effectiveness. Our forces were a hundred times more courageous and gained an absolute advantage. The battle lasted until approximately 10:00 AM, when the enemy troops finally collapsed and fled towards Wusong Town. The enemy troops suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle, and our forces also sacrificed considerably.

Recovering the Sitang River

At approximately 1:00 AM yesterday morning, our artillery regiment suddenly launched a fierce attack on the enemy positions in the Sitang area of Wusong, bombarding them for three hours. The enemy suffered more than a thousand casualties. At 7:30 AM, our forces continued to attack, and the enemy, who was reorganizing the remnants of their troops and collecting corpses, had no choice but to fight back in a hurry. Therefore, the soldiers had no morale. The battle lasted until noon, when the enemy finally collapsed and retreated into the Sitang River along the railway embankment in Wusong Town, still trying to hold on to the corner and die. At that time, enemy warships on the Huangpu River frequently fired on the shore to assist in the battle, but because the targets were inaccurate, the shells fell on their own positions, causing the enemy troops' lines to be disrupted. Our forces took advantage of the situation and advanced, recovering the Sitang River. The enemy was forced to retreat to the Yunzaobang Road.

Driving the Enemy to the Riverbank

The Second Ambulance Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society sent twenty-one wounded soldiers at 4:00 PM yesterday, all of whom had been rescued from the Wusong area. According to the wounded soldiers, there have been frequent fierce battles in the Wusong area in the past two days, and today (i.e., the 3rd) was even more intense. From morning to evening, there was no slight respite. At approximately 2:00 PM in the afternoon, our army bravely charged, and the enemy retreated in defeat. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, while our side suffered fewer casualties. Our army chased after the victory and has driven the enemy to the riverbank. Our army is currently more than a mile away from the riverbank, and both sides are now squatting on the banks of the small river and fighting fiercely. The enemy is using volley fire from time to time, and the artillery fire is very fierce. Our army is holding its ground and is not afraid at all, and has not retreated slightly. The soldiers were all injured by enemy artillery fire in this fierce battle.

### Remnants of the Enemy Surrounded on All Sides in Luodian

The battle in the Luodian area has been extremely fierce in recent days. Although the enemy troops are stubbornly resisting and making a last-ditch effort, our army's advance and pressure have been quite successful. After occupying Mengzhai and other places the day before, they continued to advance and had occupied two-thirds of the total area of the Luodian war zone by the previous night. The fighting continued all night. Yesterday morning, our army sent out a surprise force that went to the northwest corner of Xiaochuansha to outflank the enemy's rear and complete the encirclement on all sides. The remnants of the enemy have been fighting hard for ten days, with a shortage of food and ammunition, and the situation is extremely embarrassing.

### Our Planes Shot Down Three Enemy Planes

"One in Nanxiang"

At 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, our air force encountered two enemy planes over Nanxiang and shot down one enemy plane, while the other was injured and fled.

"Two in Luodian"

At approximately 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the previous day (the 2nd), a squadron of enemy planes reconnoitered our army's positions and bombed them in the Jiangwan Luodian area. Several of our planes happened to fly in from the southwest, and an engagement occurred between the two sides. Our planes immediately surrounded the enemy planes and swept them with machine guns. The enemy planes could not withstand the attack. Two of them were hit by our planes, one falling near Luodian and the other falling near Jiangwan. Another plane fled in panic.

### Our Army's Artillery Fires on Enemy Positions in Hongkou

At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning, our artillery positions in the Hongkou area bombarded the enemy's positions in the Hongkou area with heavy artillery for more than an hour. The enemy suffered heavy damage and was in a state of panic.

### The Enemy's Attack on Zhabei Was Badly Defeated

At 0:30 AM yesterday morning, the enemy concentrated its forces and launched a fierce attack on our North Station area. Our army calmly responded to the battle. When the enemy approached, it fired densely with machine guns and bombarded the enemy positions with mortars. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in defeat.

At approximately 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the enemy troops again attacked our Zhabei and North Station areas. The enemy's attack was repulsed by our troops who fought bravely. At the same time, we bombarded the enemy's position with mortars, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.

### Enemy Planes Bombed Pudong Yesterday

Yesterday, when the enemy attacked Pudong and the artillery battle was fierce, three Japanese planes flew to various parts of Pudong and dropped bombs one after another. It is estimated that the shells fired by the Japanese warships numbered about seventy or eighty until 6:00 PM in the evening, and the bombs dropped by the enemy planes numbered twenty or thirty. The wooden fishing boats parked on the shore were also affected by the flames and more than ten were burned. (The story of Hongxiang Xing's fire is inaccurate.) Landslides also caught fire in Lujiazui, burning twenty or thirty clever houses. The focus of the shells was on the streets along the shore, so the total number of houses destroyed was about one hundred. The bombs dropped by enemy planes were mostly in the Pudong railway area, and many innocent people were killed and injured. After the sound of the cannons subsided slightly, the Pudong rear hospital rescue teams were dispatched to rescue more than thirty injured people. The causes of the injuries were either bombs, shells, or machine gun bullets from planes. Several people had their arms broken, which was extremely tragic.

### Enemy Reinforcements and Ammunition Arrive One After Another

An enemy transport ship that sailed to Shanghai the day before docked at the Zhaoshang North Pier the previous evening and unloaded a large amount of ammunition, and then sailed out of Songkou yesterday morning. About 100 enemy troops were working very busily at the Zhaoshang North Pier. An enemy merchant ship was docked at the Huishan Wharf, and began unloading ammunition the day before yesterday, and had not finished unloading by noon yesterday. There were about 100 Japanese soldiers in white uniforms on the merchant ship. There were about 400 enemy troops at the Osaka Wharf. There was also a merchant ship docked at the wharf, carrying about 800 enemy troops. Judging from the situation, the 800 people on the merchant ship seemed to be preparing to continue landing to reinforce the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas. Another enemy merchant ship was docked at the Huangpu Wharf, with about 100 enemy troops on board, who also looked like they were preparing to land.

### Western Newspaper Discusses the Enemy's Difficulties in Combat

The Shanghai Times reported, "Yesterday (Thursday) this port learned that a large number of Japanese reinforcements had landed at Songkou. It is heard that the landed troops have now reached 60,000 people. (Translator's note: This is a number speculated by foreign newspapers. Foreigners have no way of knowing how much it is.) Neutral observers say that this is sufficient proof that the Japanese army will launch a major offensive. However, the Japanese side is keeping the future strategy a complete secret. According to reliable sources yesterday, the Japanese army landed was the 6th Division, the 11th Division, and at least a part of the 3rd Division. Therefore, it seems that at least 30,000 Japanese troops have landed in the past three days. Also, according to those who watched the battle in Songkou and Luodian the day before yesterday, they saw Japanese transport ships unloading horses, probably for hauling artillery. Whether the Japanese army's command thinks that the strength of the three divisions is enough to launch a general offensive is another question. However, according to the opinion of neutral observers, the later the Japanese army attacks, the better the Chinese army's chances. Any major offensive launched by the Japanese army must now be carried out on this shorter and narrower front. Because the front is short and narrow, the Chinese army can only resist with a limited force. And the Chinese army in Shanghai is large enough to contain the Japanese army. Neutral observers all believe that it is not easy for the Japanese army to attack the well-defended positions of the Chinese army. One is because the Chinese army has repaired and consolidated the positions, and the other is because the Chinese army has inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese army when they landed around Wusong and Luodian. According to someone, it is difficult for the Japanese army to launch a major offensive as soon as possible to secure itself. And because of the Chinese army's strong resistance, future advances will be more difficult.

### The Zhejiang Provincial Government Sent Personnel to Comfort the Troops

Zhu Jiahao, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, believing that the Japanese devils were invading Shanghai and our frontline soldiers were bravely killing the enemy and working extremely hard, specially sent Xuan Tiewu, the director of the Security Department, as a representative of the provincial government, to purchase a large number of supplies and go to the front to comfort the various armies. Xuan personally went to the front yesterday to comfort the troops separately, and is scheduled to return to Zhejiang in the near future. It is also heard that other provincial governments are also purchasing supplies one after another to prepare to continue to comfort the troops.

### A Huge Crane Falls into Enemy Hands

The English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that, according to reliable sources, a flat-bottomed crane of the British-owned Ruirong Shipyard, which can lift extremely heavy objects, has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. It is heard that there are only two of these machines in this port, and the Japanese army now intends to use them to lift heavy tanks and other heavy military equipment from their transport ships to the shore in Wusong. Whether the Japanese naval authorities have agreed with the manufacturer to obtain this machine is currently unknown.

### Japanese Broadcasts Rumors Claiming Our Air Force Bombed Japan

Intended to incite public sentiment and garner support for the warlords' policy of aggression.

The Central News Agency reports that Japanese radio stations, both domestically and in Shanghai, broadcast two bizarre stories yesterday: one claiming that eight of our aircraft bombed Kagoshima and the Korean Peninsula on the 2nd, and another stating that seventy-two Soviet planes bombed Japanese military positions in Shanghai on the 3rd. Yesterday afternoon, at a press conference held for foreign journalists, a spokesperson brought up these outlandish claims, and the attendees burst into laughter at Japan's unfounded fabrications. According to general observations, the reason Japan broadcast these bizarre stories is that the Japanese special Diet session is about to open. They aim to incite public sentiment to support the warlords' aggressive policies, pass a new special budget of two billion, and encourage the people to donate money to the government and enlist in the army. Furthermore, in the past few weeks, the Japanese government has repeatedly dispatched large forces to Shanghai, originally hoping to completely eliminate our fighting power in the Shanghai-Songhu area within a week. However, our army fought bravely, the enemy soldiers were unsuccessful, and the morale of their troops is gradually wavering. This broadcast is probably also a clumsy attempt to boost the morale of the enemy troops. As for the claim that Soviet planes bombed Shanghai, it is even more laughable to those in the know. Since the Japanese army invaded our country's territory, apart from enemy planes wantonly bombing non-combatants and cultural institutions in various places, no one has seen any third-country military aircraft entering our airspace. This kind of despicable propaganda is clearly a consistent tactic of the Japanese to provoke international disputes and divert the world's attention.

### Our Newspaper's Reporter Inspects the Wusong Front Line

Commander Zhong Talks Freely About the Battle Situation on Various Fronts; The Enemy's General Offensive the Night Before All Suffered Miserable Failure

Our newspaper's reporter, guided by Commander Pan of the Boy Scout Rescue Team, went to the Wusong front line for inspection at 4:00 PM last night. All the way, the setting sun shone and the breeze caressed the face. Although enemy planes followed and scouted from time to time, fortunately, they did not drop bombs. Then, in the front line near the □□□ area, we patrolled once. After nightfall, we went to □□□ to visit Commander Zhong of a certain brigade. Commander Zhong is a brave general who has made a great name for himself in the Hongkou-Wusong area for bravely killing the enemy. He has a humble attitude and sincere remarks. He reported the battle situation on various fronts as follows:

Luodian Front

Since the enemy landed on the 23rd of last month and risked death to occupy various places near Luodian, after capturing their prisoners and examining their unit numbers, and supplementing with other reliable information, the total number of people is only about four regiments. However, after the fierce war in the past ten days, the number of casualties should be at least one-third of the total. Now, on all four sides of Luodian, east, west, north, and south, there are elite troops, occupying advantageous positions and building solid fortifications, heavily besieging the enemy army, and it will be completely resolved soon. A few days ago, the commander of a certain brigade of the enemy army planned to lead his troops to break through the encirclement, but before reaching Cao Wangmiao, he was shot and killed by our army. The rest of the troops fled in panic and retreated to their original positions.

Wusong Front

The number of enemy who landed is about 1,000. Because the position is extremely cramped, there is no way to develop it, and our army is pressing forward step by step. The enemy shows a tendency to retreat without attacking. The rest of the area, such as Paotai, Baoshan, and Shizilin, has no trace of the enemy. Only Zhanghuabang still has hundreds of remnants, and there is no way out. Every time they make a desperate stand, they only cause casualties.

Hongkou Front

The enemy troops trapped in the Gongda Yarn Factory and Shanghai University are only 200 to 300 meters away from our line. Every night, in addition to our army's slight attacks, which prevent them from resting in peace, the enemy has deep trenches and high walls and dares not act rashly. Today (3rd) after 1:00 PM, the enemy troops at Shanghai University are still frequently dragging mud from the windows of the building, as if they are doing upper-level defense work to plan for a long-term defense. Although the enemy at Huishan Wharf can land at any time, their exit is blocked by us, and they cannot contact other lines. The enemy's landing only increases the death rate, so there has been no news of a continued landing recently.

Zhabei Front

The enemy army has suffered repeated defeats, with increasing casualties and shrinking lines, showing a declining trend. They even imagined asking Hongkou to transfer reinforcements. Since the connection between the enemy forces in Zhabei and Hongkou was cut off by our army, the enemy has repeatedly tried to break through at the cost of heavy sacrifices, but all have failed. Starting at 9:00 PM last night (2nd), the enemy troops in the Hongkou Garden resumed their strong efforts. Under the cover of planes and cannons, they once again launched a fierce attack on our army, but were severely damaged and returned. Today (3rd), the sound of guns and cannons in that area is still intermittent. It is also nothing more than the enemy's futile attempts. However, our defense positions are becoming more and more consolidated, and at the same time, the enemy's casualties are increasing and their morale is weakening. Since they have repeatedly failed in the past, they will be unable to recover in the future. Also, the enemy troops in Luodian and along the river failed in their general offensive last night (2nd). Today (3rd) until 10:00 PM, except for the planes' slight activities, the rest were silent and voiceless, showing a sense of disappearing, holding on to what is left. Although they have reinforcements, we also have reinforcements, so it is expected that the future fate of the enemy army on the entire line is nothing more than the end of an irreversible decline. At this point in the conversation, because the phone calls were frequent, we excused ourselves and returned. Before leaving, Commander Zhong wrote an inscription for our newspaper as a souvenir. On the way back, we learned from the adjutant of a certain headquarters that the enemy had suffered heavy losses and attempted a final struggle. It is expected that there will be another general offensive against us in the next day or two. Taking advantage of the repeated victories, we will certainly be on high alert. However, the front line needs a few things: coarse hemp rope, wooden stakes, barbed wire, wire nails, and linen bags. We hope that the people in the rear will donate generously and turn them over to the local association to meet the urgent needs.

### The Hong Kong Typhoon Caused Heavy Losses

The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was Flooded and Traffic Suspended; Wind Speed Almost Broke World Record

[Hong Kong] Yesterday, many ships in Hong Kong were overturned by the wind, and many fishermen died.

When the shipping ship Anli was crossing the sea, it touched the hull of the British cruiser Suffolk and collided with the British destroyer Duchess, damaging its bow. (According to unofficial sources, the Suffolk will have to be docked for repairs for ten days. In addition to the damage to the hull, one of the planes it was carrying was also blown off.

### Five Organizations Telegraph Wang Zhengting to Thank American Sailors

Deeply believe that it will arouse widespread sympathy; hope Americans will continue to work for justice

Five organizations, including the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, Banking Association, Money Shop Association, and Shipping Association, telegraphed Wang Zhengting, the ambassador to the United States, thanking the American Seamen's Union for expressing sympathy for China's resistance to aggression, and asked him to express their gratitude to the American government on their behalf. The telegram read, in part, that our associations have heard that the American seamen have resolved to express their sympathy for the Chinese people's resistance to aggression, demanding that American merchant ships continue to call at various Chinese ports as usual, or not go to Japan, and asking the government to announce an economic blockade against Japan, which is an act of upholding justice for the world and punishing violence internationally. The American people are known for their love of freedom and peace. We deeply believe that this matter will arouse widespread sympathy among the general public and be accepted by the government. Our associations hereby express our sincere gratitude to the American government and hope that the American people will continue to work for justice.

### There are still 2,000 American Citizens in Shanghai

Temporarily not leaving Shanghai

After the Songhu War of Resistance, a part of the American citizens had already withdrawn. According to Stanon, the US consul in Shanghai, about 1,000 American women and children have been evacuated from Shanghai. Currently, there are still 2,000 American citizens in Shanghai. Men are the largest number, and there are about 200 women. The rest are men. Whether to continue to evacuate is determined by the American citizens themselves. There is still a batch of about 200 people planning to go to Manila within days, but because the Hoover Wheel was bombed, the Dalai Wheel Ship will not come to Shanghai for the time being, so it cannot go for the time being. In addition, the American citizens in Nanjing have gone to Hankou, and the American citizens in Suzhou have gone to Mogan Mountain in Zhejiang. There are about 500 American citizens in the three provinces of Jiang, Zhejiang, and Anhui, excluding Shanghai.

A French gunboat sailed from Shanghai to Qingdao a few days ago and can arrive in Qingdao today. The French ambassador will be able to take the gunboat from Qingdao to Shanghai tomorrow.

### A Certain Public Law Scholar Discusses the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact

The general agreement between the two countries to resolve outstanding issues will not be affected or changed as a result.

[Nanjing] China and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Treaty on August 21st of this year. The significance and content of the treaty have been explained in detail by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Now, a certain public law scholar has further studied the original treaty and published his views as follows:

The public law scholar said that the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty has only four articles. Its form is simple and its meaning is profound, just as the treaty states that the Kellogg-Briand Pact is equal. It is said that the drafters of this treaty have thoroughly examined the contents of non-aggression treaties in various countries, took the essence and removed the dross, and made this important chapter for maintaining peace. However, in recent years, it has been said that this treaty does not mention the definition of aggression, and there are no words about territory in the full text. If the Soviet Union has any aggressive actions towards Outer Mongolia, is it considered a breach of contract? Also, non-aggression treaties of other countries sometimes prohibit propaganda that is incompatible with the ideology held by this country, but the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty does not mention a single word about this. Will our side allow propaganda against the Three People's Principles in the future? These are the questions that the general public has after reading the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, and they are eager to seek a definite answer. The public law scholar believes that the above questions are due to the fact that the third article of the original treaty has not been thoroughly understood. The third article of the original treaty stipulates that the provisions of this treaty shall not be interpreted as having any effect or change on the rights and obligations of the two contracting parties arising from any bilateral or multilateral treaty that the two contracting parties have signed before the entry into force of this treaty. This agreement is based on the provisions of similar treaties in most countries. For example, Article 16 of the League of Nations Treaty states that member states may take military sanctions against a certain country in certain circumstances. Now, in the Non-Aggression Treaty, it is stated that the rights and obligations arising from this multilateral treaty are not affected or changed. Therefore, in the future, when China takes military sanctions against the Soviet Union or the Soviet Union against China due to international resolutions, it must not be said to be aggression. This is a common reservation in the non-aggression treaties of most countries. However, the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty is slightly different from those signed by most countries, that is, in addition to multilateral treaties, the treaties that China and the Soviet Union have already signed are also not affected or changed. At present, regardless of whether it is a multilateral or bilateral treaty, it must be signed by both China and the Soviet Union before it can be included in the list of no impact or change. Before the signing of the Non-Aggression Treaty between China and the Soviet Union, there was only one treaty, that is, the Agreement on the General Principles for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia signed in Beijing in the 13th year of the Republic of China. The first item of the fifth article of the General Principles for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia states, "The Soviet government recognizes Outer Mongolia as an entirely part of the Republic of China and respects China's sovereignty in that territory." According to Article 3 of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, the above provisions regarding Outer Mongolia will not be affected or changed due to the signing of the Non-Aggression Treaty. In other words, this provision is still valid, so Outer Mongolia is of course still Chinese territory and is clearly not to be invaded. Also, Article 6 of the General Principles for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia states, "The governments of the two contracting parties mutually undertake not to allow the existence and actions of various agencies or groups within their respective territories that are designed to oppose the other government by violence, and promise not to engage in propaganda that is contrary to the public order and social organization of the other country." Since there was already such an agreement between China and the Soviet Union, and this time when the Non-Aggression Treaty was signed, it was clearly stated that the rights and obligations arising from the previous agreement between the two countries were not affected or changed, it is not as if one of the contracting parties may have any organization or actions in the other party that are detrimental to the government, or propaganda that is incompatible with the other party's political and social organization. This obligation is more than repeated in the Non-Aggression Treaty to state it. In short, when China and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Treaty, in addition to clearly mentioning the Kellogg-Briand Pact and mentioning the League of Nations Treaty, they also reiterated all the rights and obligations already stipulated in the only existing bilateral treaty between China and the Soviet Union. If we do not view it as such, then Article 3 of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty would be meaningless. (CNA dispatch on the 3rd)

### Anti-War Movement in Japan Becomes More Obvious

Slogans to overthrow the warlords were discovered in Tokyo; Uji gunpowder factory suddenly exploded

[Nanjing] Well-informed sources received a telegram from Shanghai stating that the Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on the 2nd that the Uji gunpowder factory in Kyoto Prefecture exploded on the night of the 1st. The fire was extinguished at 2 a.m. the next morning. More than 30 people were killed and injured. It was also learned that anti-imperialist aggression and slogans such as "Down with the warlords" were posted all over the Jinbocho area of Tokyo, which proves that the Japanese warlords' military expansion has aroused the opposition of the general public in the country. The larger the scope of aggression, the more obvious the anti-war movement will be. It is said that the explosion at the Uji gunpowder factory was caused by Japanese opponents of aggression.

### The United States' Far East Policy and the United Kingdom are Clearly Aligned

If the ships are no longer damaged, the United States is reluctant to implement the Neutrality Act

[Washington] Today, according to authoritative sources, British spokespersons have repeatedly stated that if the United Kingdom and the United States can take joint action on the Far East situation, they can shift Japan's attitude. Although the United States does not pay much attention to this suggestion, it also feels difficult to deal with because the United States' Far East policy does not want to disagree with the United Kingdom. However, the US government also knows that some parties believe that the United Kingdom has other views on international relations, so they oppose the United States and the United States taking joint action on the China-Japan issue. It is learned that President Roosevelt and many members of the cabinet believe that the United Kingdom's handling of international affairs is related to the British suggestion that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France jointly protect the lives and property of foreigners in the Shanghai Concession and ask the Chinese and Japanese troops to leave the vicinity of Shanghai. The United States government does not intend to decide on its attitude for the time being because it believes that this suggestion may not be accepted by both China and Japan. (National Telegram on the 2nd)

[Washington] State Department officials expressed hope that the Neutrality Act would not need to be invoked because US ships were far away from Shanghai. The official also said that if US ships stay away from dangerous areas and avoid war damage from bombs and shells, then the president may not feel it necessary to declare that a war officially exists between China and Japan. (Reuters dispatch from CNA on the 2nd)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently released a statement to the press, saying that the government has authorized Admiral Yanar, commander of the Asian Fleet, to have the authority to act as appropriate on the issue of protecting the nationals and merchant ships in Shanghai, so that he can take necessary measures according to the situation there. The U.S. merchant ships are currently sailing into Shanghai under the escort of warships. The Navy Department believes that the Asian Fleet's flagship "Augusta" and its old-fashioned destroyers and gunboats are sufficient to escort merchant ships, so if no accident occurs, it does not intend to send additional warships to China, so as to avoid the difficulty of transferring the new-style warships stranded in Chinese waters in the future.

### Göring's Speech

Strengthen War Preparations, Strive for Progress

⊙Stuttgart. German Aviation Minister Göring delivered a speech today to 20,000 German representatives from overseas, stating that Germany is no longer a defeated nation, but a strong country maintaining peace under the leadership of Hitler. However, the revival of culture, the reformation of the military, and the promotion of the Four-Year Plan all depend on the efforts and cooperation of overseas German communities, which cannot be achieved by the power of a few foreign envoys. Göring continued, saying that Führer Hitler is extremely eager for world peace, and Germany's plan for progress must succeed in an absolutely peaceful environment. Next, regarding the Four-Year Plan, he stated that Germany absolutely does not want to isolate itself in international trade, but wants to maintain mutual trade relations with all countries, while not allowing foreign countries to restrain it. Finally, Göring solemnly declared that from now on, Jews will not be allowed to represent German commercial interests abroad. If Jews boycott overseas German communities, then Jews in Germany will be required to compensate for the losses suffered by German communities abroad. (National News Agency Sea Telegram from the 3rd)

⊙Stuttgart, Germany. German Aviation Minister General Göring spoke today to an audience of 20,000 people at the Sixth Congress of Germans Living Abroad, saying, "We want peace, but if others do not want it, then we must fully prepare for war. When our new warships come to see you in the future, you must be proud of them. The day I send my fleet to see you is not far off. Foreign journalists here may say that the god of war is now roaring again. I want to tell you that no country in the world knows war better than Germany. Germany will avoid war for as long as possible." It is reported that participants in this conference included German communities from Southwest Africa, the Far East, North and South America.

### Guaranteeing Security in the Mediterranean

France Proposes a Meeting, British Government Agrees

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden, Privy Councilor Kingsley Wood, First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald held a meeting today to discuss the issue of security in the Mediterranean. It was decided to continue sending warships to the Mediterranean and to endorse France's proposal for mutual consultation among Mediterranean coastal countries to ensure maritime security. In addition, it was also decided that if British ships in the Mediterranean are attacked by any vessel in the future, at any time or place, British warships should immediately retaliate against those vessels, pursue and sink them. It is generally believed that the League of Nations General Assembly will soon convene in Geneva (on the 13th of this month). At that time, representatives from Mediterranean coastal countries—Britain, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt—may take the opportunity to discuss this issue. As for whether Black Sea coastal countries, including the Soviet Union and Romania, will participate in the meeting, it will be decided by the Mediterranean coastal countries. Although the outcome of the meeting cannot be predicted at present, it is expected that the fleets of the countries concerned will cooperate with each other to protect the safety of their merchant ships. (Havas Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 2nd)

[London] The French government's proposal to convene a meeting of Mediterranean coastal countries in Geneva has been accepted by the British government. Well-informed sources believe that Britain's acceptance of this proposal should not be seen as acceptance of France's plan to conclude a Mediterranean Pact. Firstly, according to France's original intention, this plan is not immediately implementable. Secondly, Britain believes that the relations between the Mediterranean coastal countries are not yet sufficiently clear. If a Mediterranean Pact is signed in the near future, it would be difficult to achieve success. For this reason, the proposal to conclude a Mediterranean Pact, although not completely abandoned, will certainly not be realized in the near future.

### Russian Merchant Ship Sunk by a Torpedo

⊙Athens. Just hours after the 7,000-ton "Woodford" oil tanker was sunk off the coast of Spain by a submarine of unknown nationality, another merchant ship was torpedoed and sunk in the Mediterranean. The victim this time was the Soviet merchant ship "Morozov," which sank off the island of Skyros. It is reported that the torpedo was fired by a submarine flying the flag of the Spanish Nationalist forces. One crew member was killed in the explosion, and the rest landed safely. This is the second Soviet ship to be sunk this week. (Reuters Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 3rd)

Current Commentary

### Respecting the Vested Interests of Friendly Nations

— Yu

Spreading rumors and sowing discord are the usual tricks of the enemy. Recently, because of their military setbacks, they have been using every possible means of spreading rumors and sowing discord. The so-called rumor that "Chinese troops will use force to reclaim the concessions" is one of the most vicious rumors. Its intention is clearly to harm the sympathy of friendly people for China.

We believe that more insightful friendly people will not believe such absurd rumors. However, ordinary foreign merchants with slightly less political insight may mistakenly believe that China's victory will be detrimental to them, fearing that their property is not guaranteed due to the aforementioned rumors. We feel very regretful for those friendly people who easily believe rumors.

Please, friendly people, open your eyes and look at the ironclad facts. Who destroyed your property and threatened your lives? Six years ago, the four northeastern provinces were quite peaceful. Trade between China and various countries was developing normally there, and the lives and property of all friendly people were well protected by China. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the four northeastern provinces were successively occupied by the enemy. All the interests of friendly people were completely excluded. Now, where is there still room for you to stand? Furthermore, look at North China. Britain has great interests in North China. I think the British people must know who destroyed their property and who threatened their lives. Moving closer to the present, look at the Shanghai area. Who is declaring a blockade of Chinese ports and hindering trade between China and various countries? It was clearly a British car and clearly flying a British flag, but the dignified ambassador was blatantly strafed by machine guns from an airplane and seriously injured. Who was the murderer? Even fire has no guarantee of life, and other things can be imagined.

To be honest, in the eyes of Japanese imperialists, China is to be exclusively occupied by Japan. The places occupied by the Japanese army in Chinese territory are also where the original interests of friendly people are completely extinguished.

China's War of Resistance is for self-defense and for the survival of the nation. The only country that threatens the survival of the Chinese nation at present is Japan. Therefore, China's only enemy is Japan. We not only have no ill will towards other friendly nations, but we are also very grateful for the sympathy of friendly people for China's War of Resistance. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will of course respect and protect the vested interests of friendly nations in China, as well as all lives and property, as much as possible. This is the case in Shanghai, and it is the same in other places outside Shanghai. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once stated that "The Chinese army is fighting in Shanghai. Apart from self-defense against Japanese attacks, there is no other purpose. The wish of the Chinese government is the same as that of all other related countries. It is extremely willing to keep the normal state of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession as undisturbed as possible within the possible range, and to restore it as soon as possible." This statement clearly expresses the unanimous will of the entire country today.

We would like to sincerely advise all friendly people that the Chinese government and the Chinese people respect the vested interests of friendly nations. Only the victory of China's War of Resistance can guarantee the safety of all the interests of friendly nations.

### Editorial in the North-China Daily News Praises Our Spirit of Resistance

Broad Discussion of the Shanghai Battle Situation in the Past Three Weeks, The Japanese Side Has Admitted Encountering Fierce Resistance

The North-China Daily News published an editorial yesterday entitled "Three Weeks," which stated in brief: "In the three weeks of fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops around Shanghai, the overall situation in China has become increasingly clear that it is developing solidly on the basis of war. Japan's declared intention has made this clear. Although the battle of Shanghai is particularly noteworthy, it may, as it continues, be an accidental event in the overall war situation. In short, this war is China's war of self-defense. Japanese troops are attacking with large forces in Chinese territory, while Chinese troops are trying to defend their country. Japanese spokesmen have admitted that their troops have encountered fierce resistance in Shanghai and have praised the bravery of the Chinese army. Therefore, certain assumptions held earlier regarding the conduct of the battle in the Shanghai area must now be revised to be fair. The slow pace of the Japanese army's actions clearly shows that the Japanese army wants to avoid the mistake of underestimating the enemy. However, their constant acts of aggression in words and deeds may only strengthen the Chinese army's resistance. No matter what China's position was a few weeks ago, China is united today. This is not just a contrived enthusiasm, but a real and important factor. The unity of the Chinese army's resistance is such that China has never been so united in the new era. The Chinese army, from commanders to soldiers, is determined to resist the enemy without seeking publicity, partly because they know that publicizing it carelessly is very dangerous, and partly because they have obtained evidence that the spirit of the nation now does not need artificial encouragement with exaggerated victory news. They say that if they fight but do not win, then publishing victory reports is not enough to comfort themselves. If they resist the Japanese army's invasion for a long time and win, then the facts will be ironclad evidence, which is more touching than the propaganda organs that exaggerate the news. The need for Chinese men and women civilians to labor for the national struggle is also a new concept in China. This can be clearly demonstrated by the people's actions to rescue and comfort the army. In short, China today is determined to resist for many months, and all feel that exaggerating victory in this initial stage is of no help. Chinese civilians also do not want to argue with those who support the other side. The Chinese army commanders are the same. They do not want others to know about them, but are working hard to develop their military defenses and unite as one. This will be judged by the results they achieve. They hope to use these results to preserve China's independent integrity and become a country that cannot be subdued by aggressive troops. If this is the spirit that encourages Chinese leaders and the troops they command to resist, then it should be taken into account by the Japanese army and will certainly be a spirit to be respected." (Translator's Note: Recently, the London Times commented on the Sino-Japanese War, saying that if China does not resist this time, it will lose its national character. Because of today's War of Resistance, it has raised its status to a level not seen in ten years. The translator has been translating Western newspapers for thirty years and has never seen the North-China Daily News praise China as it does today. Because the national character is high, foreigners look at it with new eyes. I humbly wish that all compatriots across the country will take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and assist the country with their manpower or financial resources to achieve final victory, so that they will not let down the spirits of their ancestors in heaven, nor the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers fighting on the front lines, nor the sincerity of the friendly people.)

### Central Bank and Colleagues Subscribe to 20 Million Yuan of National Salvation Bonds

The Central Trust Bureau Subscribes to 5 Million Yuan

Since the start of the full-scale War of Resistance, the government, in order to accumulate resources and prepare for sustained victory, has issued 500 million yuan of National Salvation Bonds. Driven by patriotic enthusiasm, all public and private organizations and agency service personnel have enthusiastically subscribed. It is learned that the Central Bank and all its colleagues have subscribed to a total of 20 million yuan of the bonds, distributed as follows: 10 million yuan for the Central Bank headquarters, 5 million yuan for the Central Trust Bureau, 1 million yuan for colleagues in the head office and branches, 2 million yuan for the Nanjing, Hankou, Hangzhou, Xiamen, Nanchang, and Chongqing branches, 1 million yuan for the Qingdao, Jinan, Wuhu, Kaifeng, Changsha, and Chengdu branches, 500,000 yuan for the Zhenjiang, Bengbu, Xuzhou, and Anqing branches, and 500,000 yuan for the Ningbo, Luoyang, Shijiazhuang, Wanxian, and Wuchang branches. As soon as it is collected, it will be submitted to the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee. The enthusiastic subscription of the bank and others is greatly appreciated by all sectors of society, and it will not be difficult to raise the 500 million yuan within a short period of time.

### Social Bureau and Others Hold Poison Gas Defense and First Aid

Teacher Training Class

In view of the need for knowledge and skills of wartime service personnel, the Municipal Social Bureau, the Chinese Special Education Association, and the Shanghai Student Wartime Service Corps have specially organized a poison gas defense and first aid teacher training class in order to train the public and students and achieve widespread effectiveness. The subjects are divided into poison gas defense and first aid. Classes are held for two hours each day and completed in two weeks. Poison gas defense is taught by chemistry professors from Tongji University and other universities, and first aid is taught by Dr. Fei Kunnian and others. Teaching equipment is provided by Chinese and Western pharmacies. The first phase is divided into two locations, one in each special district, and classes are opened simultaneously. It is completely free. All primary and secondary school teachers can be recommended by their original schools, but each school can recommend a maximum of three people for selection. The general office is located at 500 Avenue Joffre, where schools can send their applications from today. The application should specify the name, age, gender, place of origin, education, special skills, mailing address, and telephone number. The opening date will be announced soon.

### Reward Measures for Raising National Salvation Bonds

Since the solicitation of National Salvation Bonds, subscriptions from all parties have been very enthusiastic. It is learned that the government has formulated reward measures for subscribing to and raising National Salvation Bonds. Those with outstanding achievements will be awarded plaques and various grades of medals. These measures will be announced soon. In addition, the Bank of Communications has initially subscribed to 6 million yuan of National Salvation Bonds and will continue to subscribe in the future.

### Supplementary Notes on the Calamity in the Hongkou War Zone

Endless Ruins, Bloodstains and Stench on the Roads

Our reporter yesterday met another refugee who had just escaped from the Hudong area of ​​Yangshupu. He told us about the situation after the calamity in the Hongkou war zone that he had witnessed. Now we will record his own description, which can also supplement the inadequacies of yesterday's report.

He is a small merchant who runs a tobacco shop on Qihua Road. After the outbreak of the war, his elderly mother, wife, and children, unable to withstand the intimidation of the Japanese soldiers, left the shop with his shop assistants, and their lives are still unknown. Because he could not bear to abandon the shop he had run for many years, he stayed in the shop. Recently, because the Japanese army transported military supplies and transported disembarking Japanese soldiers for redeployment, and did not want our people to know their secrets, he ordered the expulsion of our resident civilians. Therefore, he was not rescued by the trucks of the International Settlement until the day before yesterday. Because the group's vehicles took detours to pick up and rescue people everywhere, he was able to see the tragic scenes along the way in the middle and upper sections. However, because the vehicles were driving too fast, he could only see it in a flash and could not observe it in detail. However, everything he saw mostly matched what was reported in this newspaper yesterday. He said that the shops and houses in the Xihua Road and Gongping Road areas were the most severely burned: ruins were everywhere. On Broadway and Yangshupu Road, except for the warehouses along the river such as Da Kang Yarn Factory, Shenxin No. 7 Factory, Ruyong Iron Factory, and the houses of each dock, which are still intact, the houses on the north side are mostly burned intermittently. The factory buildings on both sides of the British-American Tobacco Company are only steel skeletons. The rest, such as Dalianwan Road, Huade Road, Kunming Road, Tangshan Road, Zhoushan Road, and Huishan Road, have also suffered fire or were destroyed by artillery shells. In front of the Huishan Garden gate, the road is sunken, as if it had been hit by an artillery shell. The north-facing gate still has barbed wire, wooden boards, sandbags, etc. blocking it. The buildings that have not been burned, according to memory, can be returned to those such as the Yulin Road and Yulinli area, the Tangshan Road Xinmin Iron Factory and the opposite Puzhi Primary School area, and others such as the Dalianwan Road World Bookstore, Huacheng Tobacco Company, Hua Yi Printing Factory, and Nianhua Primary School area are all intact; only the Dachina Restaurant opposite Nianhua Primary School and others were completely burned. The high-rise buildings such as the Hua Yi Printing Factory and the Ningguo Road Shengbi Hospital have bullet marks on the north-facing windows and walls, as dense as a honeycomb, which shows the intensity of our army's attack at that time. As for the actions of the Japanese army that can be noted, there are groups of three or five people in the shape of Japanese ronin and unarmed plainclothes teams everywhere. The Japanese soldiers have young army soldiers wearing soft hats and navy soldiers wearing steel helmets, but there are not many of them. They are thought to be hiding indoors. For example, across from the Hua Yi Printing Factory, there are many Japanese soldiers, or one of their platoon headquarters. Not many defensive works are seen on each road. Only north of Pingliang Road, at the end of Ningguo Road, and at Guilan Road, a small number of Japanese soldiers are guarding inside sandbags. The end of Tangshan Road and north of Zhoujiazui Road are not allowed to pass. Broadway Road all the way east to Yangshupu Bridge is like a washed road, without sandbags or anything else, and road workers from the Public Works Department in red vests are seen sweeping along the way and repairing the electric wires. Also, the roads north of Waihong Bridge to Di Siwei Road, Jiaxing Times, Wusong Road, and Shenjiawan are also blocked. When passing the China Merchants Bureau warehouse in Waihong Bridge, Japanese military vehicles are seen driving in one after another. (It is said that the goods stored in the China Merchants Bureau warehouse have been transported away by Japanese soldiers and replaced with military supplies.) Sandbags and barbed wire are piled up at the bridge piers, and Japanese soldiers and Japanese special police are stationed there. Refugee trucks must be strictly inspected when passing through. If there is anything suspicious, they will be detained. Also, on Yuanfang Road and other places, packages and trunks are everywhere on the road. Bloodstains are still vaguely visible nearby. Flies are gathered in swarms, and the stench is unbearable. From this, it can be seen that the number of Chinese people brutally killed by the Japanese army must be countless. Also, in the alleys and street houses that have not been burned, almost every household's door is wide open, and the interior is extremely messy. The rest of the things are hard to describe in one word.

Unexpectedly, the great cause had just begun, and the Shanghai war reopened. Mr. Zheng lamented that the national crisis was deepening and was unwilling to lag behind in saving the country. Therefore, on the day before yesterday (2nd), he sent a letter to his old friend Mr. Xu Fu, director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, subscribing to 20,000 yuan of National Salvation Bonds, and entrusted Director Xu to transfer a car prepared by himself (International Settlement note No. 1852) to the Rear Support Association for use.

### Refugee Numbers Surge

Tzu Lien Hui and International Agencies Expand Reception Centers

Following days of intense fighting between our troops and the Japanese invaders from Luodian to Baoshan and Wusong, people from all over have fled to Shanghai in droves. Thousands of refugees are crowding in front of the Tzu Lien Hui on Six Ma Road every day, seeking relief and refuge. The Tzu Lien Hui's monastic rescue teams have also rescued a large number of refugees in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas in recent days, causing difficulties for the shelter. Subsequently, the association selected staff to borrow houses from all walks of life. They have now found several large buildings and organized four reception centers: Huguo Temple on Menglana Road, Daguan Lou on Stone Road, Hongyun Lou on French Concession Road, and Yiyuan Hotel on Race Course Road. All newly received refugees have been settled separately.

Since the International Relief Committee has been actively operating with the participation of authorities from the two concessions and various organizations, regardless of nationality, in addition to setting up three refugee shelters with a capacity of over 6,000 people, it has been noted that there are many refugees who have not yet escaped from the war zone. A fourth reception center has been established on Yanping Road, specifically to accommodate refugees from the Yangshupu area. Registration of refugees who have not escaped the war zone began yesterday in order to actively provide relief.

### Broadcasting Names of Lost Refugees in War Zones

### Enemy Plane Bombing Zhabei Shot Down by Our Machine Guns

Fuselage Explodes in Mid-Air, Debris Flying; Stray Bullets from Enemy Planes Kill and Wound Many in Two Concessions; Enemy Fails to Break Through in Wusong and Luodian

Starting at 5:00 AM this morning, large numbers of enemy planes were active everywhere and dropped bombs in Zhabei, bombing our military positions, while indiscriminately firing machine guns in aimless sweeps. Stray bullets killed and wounded many in the two concessions. This afternoon, three enemy planes bombed Zhabei again, and one was hit by our anti-aircraft machine guns. The fuselage was burned on the spot, with black smoke billowing and debris flying. Citizens standing on the streets witnessed the event and cheered. Also, under the cover of planes, the enemy again launched an attack on our Zhabei positions at dawn. Our troops calmly responded, remaining unmoved. The enemy eventually retreated. Regarding the Wusong area, after a fierce battle throughout the night, our troops' encirclement line continued to advance. In the Luodian area, the enemy was surrounded on all sides by our troops and unable to break out. At 5:00 AM this morning, the most intense hand-to-hand combat began. Our troops fought bloody battles against the enemy for two hours, but the enemy still retreated to the original line, and we maintained absolute superiority. According to observations by a certain military strategist, the enemy who landed initially planned to copy our rear routes, but ultimately, because Luodian was surrounded, they could not break through. The enemy in Liuhe originally provided remote support, but now they have had to withdraw and seek other activities. At the same time, they also attempted to break through from Wusong to Luodian, but this was also blocked by our troops. All plans have failed. Moreover, the enemy who landed in various places have had their connections severed by our troops. With fragmented and depleted enemy forces, small positions, and crowded numbers, prolonged fighting will inevitably lead to their complete collapse, it is predicted.

### Stray Bullets Fly in Two Concessions

Over a Dozen Killed and Wounded on Avenue Dubail; Members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Also Injured

At 6:30 AM today, a bomb suddenly exploded at the back entrance of the Jiangnan Inn on Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, injuring over a dozen people, who were all sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, a hand grenade explosion was discovered at the base of the wall of Tingyun Lane on Avenue Dubail, killing a certain Sheng, who traded in second-hand goods, on the spot, and injuring over a dozen people. The police are currently investigating the source of the explosives. Also, at 9:15 AM, a small artillery shell landed in the tram company's parking lot on Lind Road but did not explode. In addition, there were stray bullets in front of the Xinhua Bank on Heping Road in the Nanshi area, near Xiaonanmen, in Suozilong in the city, and in Heyu Lane on Jingxiu Road. It is said that the bullets were thrown by enemy planes flying low. Currently, all police agencies in the city are conducting thorough investigations and taking strict precautions to prevent spies from infiltrating and causing trouble. Yesterday, a large number of artillery shells, anti-aircraft shells, and shrapnel fell in the concessions. The Municipal Council's ambulances were dispatched to 32 locations, and a total of 46 injured people were transported to various hospitals, most of whom were injured by stray bullets. Fire engines were also quite busy. Also, at 5:45 PM yesterday, two members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, W. G. Nicholls and M. P. Doyle, were injured by an anti-aircraft shell that fell on the Race Course. Also, at 2:10 PM yesterday, a member of the Volunteer Corps (Russian Company), Kosnyreff, was injured by shrapnel on the Bund on Beijing Road.

### Enemy Planes Run Rampant, Killing and Wounding People Everywhere

Special Zone Areas Affected

Japanese planes have been wantonly bombing Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong for days, and they have also been strafing non-combatant refugees, charitable organizations, and rescue workers with machine guns, which is truly inhumane. This morning, while flying over the concession area, they dropped small hand grenades, causing many innocent people to be killed and wounded at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, as well as on Gansu Road, the intersection of Kaifeng Road, and Mohuo Road. From 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM this morning, a large group of Japanese planes flew over the public concession area. As soon as the planes flew over various places, bombs and other explosives fell, and in many places, there was machine gun strafing, causing a significant number of injuries and deaths. As a result, ambulances were dispatched frequently, and hospitals such as Renji and Bao Ci were almost full. The following is a record of the findings, and there are undoubtedly many more that have not yet been identified: 1. Five people injured at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road; 2. One person injured at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Zhejiang Road; 3. Two people injured across from the Tongchang Car Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road; 4. Two killed and three injured on Danshui Road; 5. Many injured near the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road; 6. One ticket checker injured at the tram company's ticket booth on Haige Road; 7. Two children killed at the intersection of Tongfu Road and South Chengdu Road, Dazhong Lane: one, Shen Ren, 14 years old, from Jiaxing, resident of No. 140 Dazhong Lane; one, Zhou Peigen, 9 years old, resident of No. 107, Lane 638, Xinzha Road. Both children were hit by machine gun bullets from enemy planes. Locations 5 and 7 were strafed by machine guns, while the rest were injured by small bombs. This also shows the recklessness and inhumanity of the Japanese planes. Also, the roof of the Chengdu Road police station was hit by a stray bullet at 6:50 AM this morning, only destroying one side of the building, fortunately without injuring anyone. Also, according to news from the Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, at 6:30 AM this morning, two Japanese planes flew to the North Station area to bomb, and Chinese troops opened fire with machine guns. At 6:55 AM, an anti-aircraft shell landed on the roof of the Chengdu Road police station servants' quarters, causing minor damage with no injuries. At 7:00 AM, an artillery shell fell near Jing'an Temple, not far from the police station there, injuring one Chinese person. Also, it was reported that 25 people were injured in the Xinzha area and 6 in the Laozha area when Japanese planes bombed the North Station this morning. There were also several injuries in the Chengdu Road area. At 9:10 AM, a Japanese plane dropped a bomb over the railroad junction on Macgregor Road. At 10:50 AM, Japanese military planes dropped four bombs near the North Station, one of which fell on Aierjin Road, very close to the concession, and another appeared not to have exploded.

### Enemy Plane Destroyed

Hit by Our Machine Guns, Instantly White Smoke Soars

Starting at 6:00 AM today, enemy planes in groups of three to five constantly bombed Zhabei, dropping no fewer than thirty to fifty bombs. Aside from the destruction of civilian homes, we suffered no major losses. Unexpectedly, at 12:15 PM, three enemy planes flew north very low over the concession. While the first plane was dropping bombs at the intersection of Hengfeng Road and Republic Road, the second plane's fuel tank was hit by our anti-aircraft machine guns just as it was about to drop bombs. It instantly fell on the wasteland on Macgregor Road with a loud crash. All that could be seen was white smoke soaring into the sky, and aluminum wings floated like butterflies. The two pilots were cremated inside the plane. The third plane still dropped two bombs, circled several times, and then quietly fled.

### Remaining Enemy Troops in Wusong Retreating Towards the Riverbank

The Rumor of an Attack on Yuepu and Baoshan Has Been Completely Proven Impossible

(Special Report) After being pressed by our troops, the enemy in Wusong has retreated towards the riverbank, gathering along the riverbank area. Last night, enemy warships in the Huangpu River shelled our positions near Wusong to cover the advance and retreat of their infantry. Our rear artillery immediately returned fire, with both sides exchanging fire until this morning, when the sound of artillery gradually subsided. Although our positions were under intense enemy fire, we still tracked the enemy and charged forward with aggressive progress. The enemy's plan to attack Baoshan and Yuepu has been completely defeated. The rumor that the Japanese army attacked Yuepu is clearly an impossible fact. The enemy who retreated into the railway area of Wusong Town along the riverbank is still fighting stubbornly. If no reinforcements arrive, the enemy will be resolved by us, which is only a matter of time.

### Remaining Enemy Troops in Luodian Will Retreat Without Fighting

Panic Over Food Supply Has Occurred; Retreat Route Will Be Cut Off by Us

(Special Report) The battle in Luodian has been extremely fierce for days. The trapped enemy has repeatedly tried to break out but has been repelled by our troops. Our troops are simultaneously attacking from three directions with rapid progress. The enemy's positions have shrunk even further. The encircled enemy is estimated to number about one brigade. After days of fighting, most have been killed or wounded. Last night, one of our routes attacking Xiaochuanshakou was quite successful. The enemy's retreat route has been almost completely cut off. Two-thirds of Luodian Town is under our control. The enemy only has a foothold in one-third. In this small area, the enemy has no room to maneuver. This morning, the encircled enemy launched several fierce breakouts, and extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat occurred. The enemy has retreated under the charge and hand-to-hand combat of our troops this afternoon. The encircled enemy will soon be completely resolved. The enemy in Luodian is panicking due to lack of food. Under these embarrassing circumstances, they will starve to death without fighting.

### Enemy Troops Landing Have Lost Their Fighting Spirit

All Routes Surrounded by Our Troops; Only Shidongkou Still Has Remaining Enemy

(Special Report) This morning, a certain staff officer from the ____ Division Headquarters came to Shanghai from the front line. Introduced by a friend, a reporter visited him at his residence. He provided the latest war news from various routes on the front line and explained with diagrams in great detail. Except for military secrets, the following can be disclosed: 1. The enemy launched a general offensive on all routes starting the night before last (2nd) until noon yesterday. After our troops' strong resistance, the enemy not only made no progress but also suffered heavy losses, with disorganized lines, and soldiers had lost their fighting spirit. 2. Since the enemy suffered significant losses on the front line, they unleashed their beastly power, bombing the rear and massacring our innocent civilians. Just look at the Zhabei area this morning, where enemy planes in groups of three to five dropped bombs like rain. Their cruelty can be seen. 3. The enemy's current foothold, in addition to Hongkou and East Shanghai, is only along the Jiangwan, Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, and Wusong, Paotaiwan areas, forming a vertical line. They are all surrounded by our troops and will not be allowed to cross the Lei Pool one step. 4. West of Wusong, from Baoshan to Liuhe, only Shidongkou has some remaining enemy troops, like turtles in a jar, with no further development. 5. There are still two large pockets of remaining enemy troops in the northeast and northwest of Luodian, which are also surrounded by our troops, not connected end to end, and can be wiped out soon. In short, our troops have detailed plans. No matter how stubborn the enemy is, they will not be able to advance. This is something that can be comforting to our compatriots.

### Enemy Planes Peep at Pudong Again This Morning

Several Bombs Dropped, Our Side Suffered No Damage; Great Fire Yesterday Gradually Extinguished This Afternoon

Yesterday morning, Japanese troops peeped at Pudong from the Chunjiang Wharf and were repelled by our troops. The other side then fired large cannons and planes dropped bombs indiscriminately, intending to destroy our positions. Our side also frequently returned fire, and the two sides fought fiercely until 7:00 PM, when it gradually stopped. Around 10:00 PM, Japanese warships only fired two or three shots and then stopped. Afterwards, except for enemy planes scouting from time to time, there was no movement until dawn. This morning, only two or three Japanese planes circled over Pudong from time to time and dropped bombs, but our side suffered no damage. Fearing shelling from our side, the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River have moved to several locations and are silent. According to general observations, the enemy's actions yesterday were purely to test our troops' strength in Pudong. Once they engaged, they realized that our troops were strong and difficult to invade, and their ambition was thwarted. The British-owned Taikong Coal Stack outside Lujiazui in Pudong was hit by Japanese warship fire and exploded at 1:00 PM during yesterday's Huangpu River artillery battle, following the Chunjiang Wharf, causing a fire. Because all the warehouses were full of coal, the fire was intense, and black smoke filled the sky for a long time without extinguishing. It weakened in the evening, and the fire rekindled at 9:00 AM this morning, with thick smoke blocking the sky. It subsided slightly near noon. The stack suffered a major disaster for no reason, with heavy losses, it is said.

### Remaining Enemy Troops in Hongkou Counterattack Unsuccessful

According to the Central News Agency, at around 3:30 AM this morning, enemy troops in Hongkou attempted to counterattack again, suddenly using small steel cannons and machine guns to attack our positions fiercely. Enemy warships in Wusong also assisted with heavy artillery. Our troops were on high alert and only returned fire with field guns. For a time, the sound of artillery was dense like a string of beads, but the enemy saw that we were prepared and ultimately did not dare to attack. Therefore, the sound of artillery soon stopped. At that time, many shrapnel fell in the Huizi area of the concession.

### Fires in Hongkou and Pudong This Morning

According to the Municipal Council's report, a major fire broke out behind Meilun Middle School at around 7:00 AM this morning. The fire in Pudong had been burning for a night and only extinguished this morning. At 8:00 AM, fires broke out in the Haisheng Road and Oujia Road areas. The period between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM was relatively calm. There were five or six fires between Zhoujiazui Road and Meilun Middle School, and there was also a fire near Bazilu and Hexikeer Road, with intense flames. Also, between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, fires broke out in the following four locations: 1. Aierjin Road and North Jiangxi Road; 2. North Sichuan Road and Haining Road (staff from the concession fire brigade have rushed to the above two locations to put out the fires); 3. Macgregor Road station building (caused by bombing); 4. Near the Anli warehouse in Pudong.

### Enemy Attempts to Forcibly Take Over Jibei Border, Our Troops Recapture Zhenbian City

Vanguard Units Have Crossed the Great Wall Line, Cutting Off the Enemy's Response on the Ping-Sui Railway Line; The Enemy Has Not Succeeded on the Ping-Han and Jin-Pu Railway Lines

[Baoding] Under the dense haze of the Ping-Han Line for the past three days, the war situation is now silent. The enemy is near Yufa and Panggezhuang in Gu'an County, seeming to have an attempt to invade south along the highway line. We have long placed heavy troops on that side, and the positions are as solid as fortresses, making it difficult for the enemy to succeed. Also, on the Jibei border, after we recaptured Zhenbian City, the vanguard units have crossed the Great Wall Line and advanced to a certain location in the distance, completing communication with a certain army in that location, cutting off the enemy's response on the Ping-Sui Railway Line. The enemy in the Juyongguan area has fallen into a position of being attacked from both the front and rear. Our counter-offensive military is extremely optimistic. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)

[Jinan] There is no change on the Tangguantun front today. A certain division's certain brigade of ours on the Huifeng Bridge is in a fierce battle with the enemy at Dazhuangyangzha and Chaozong Bridge in the Hubei area. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)

[Baoding] Recently, the enemy again used a combined force of infantry and artillery of about 2,000 to launch a fierce attack on our Chenguantun position more than 20 miles north of Machang on the Jin-Pu front. After our troops bravely resisted, the enemy did not succeed and are still in a stalemate. Also, the enemy invading the Chaozong Bridge area was fiercely attacked by our defending troops. As a result of the bloody battle, one enemy company commander, Ichifu Kuroda, and many soldiers were killed. Our troops also seized six enemy light machine guns and more than forty rifles. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 3rd)

[Baoding] At 2:30 PM on the 3rd, nine enemy planes flew south along the railway line to Rongcheng, but were forced to return due to rain. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)

### Enemy Attempts to Forcibly Take Over Various Sections of the Ping-Sui and Ping-Han Railways

[Nanjing] According to the Ministry of Transportation, many people from the Hai Railway and the enemy's transportation team have now gone to Tianjin and Beijing, intending to forcibly take over various sections of the Ping-Sui and Ping-Han Railways (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 3rd).

### United States Adopts Independent Policy Towards Sino-Japanese War

Denies Joint Action with Britain

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement saying that the government has sent new instructions to the U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, instructing him to advise American expatriates to take advantage of the existing opportunities to be sent back to their country and make good plans for themselves. Referring to reports that Britain and the United States will cooperate on the Chinese seas, he said that the U.S. government is still pursuing a policy of an independent nature, and will not shift to any other country's policy. However, it is common for the U.S. authorities to exchange information and consult with responsible authorities in other countries who are in the same position and have the same interests. "However, this kind of cooperation should not be confused with joint action," he said (Havas Dispatch on the 3rd from Central News Agency).

[Washington] U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced today that the State Department, in its recent efforts, has issued the strongest warning to American expatriates, advising them to stay away from Shanghai and other war zones. Regarding the rumors that Britain and the United States are closely cooperating on the Far East incident, Hull told reporters that the government's foreign policy is separate and independent, but there are times when changes are made at its own discretion. Furthermore, the American Red Cross announced that it does not intend to send Red Cross personnel to China or hold a national fundraising event, but is willing to accept donations from various groups and individuals who wish to help Chinese relief efforts, which should be remitted to the Chinese Red Cross and other relief organizations. American Red Cross President Clayson also stated that the Japanese Red Cross has rejected foreign assistance (Reuters Dispatch on the 4th from Central News Agency).

### National Faculty and Students Purchase National Salvation Bonds

Wang Shijie Cables Song Ziwen

[Nanjing] Wang Shijie cabled Song Ziwen on the 3rd, saying (title omitted): "You, sir, have recently been vigorously promoting the National Salvation Bonds, which I admire. I believe that faculty and students of all schools should make every effort to advocate for this matter, so that the issuance quota can be raised as soon as possible. It is estimated that there are about 620,000 teachers and staff in schools at all levels across the country, about 600,000 students in middle schools and above, and about 18 million elementary school students. The Ministry of Education is currently drafting detailed measures to ensure that those with the ability purchase and solicit a certain amount on their own, and those without the ability are also responsible for soliciting a certain amount.

### Trivial Comments

--On "Ke Ding"

"Ke Ding" is the most harmful thing in the world. It is also the most precious thing. Without "Ke Xu", one would do anything to the extreme, such as being a thief or a robber. But once there is "Ke Xu", "the son of a thousand gold does not sit under a leaning eaves." Therefore, one thinks of preserving one's life everywhere, and one thinks of preserving one's "Ke Xu" everywhere. Therefore, for any method that can increase or preserve one's life or "Ke Xu", one does not hesitate to trumpet justice and humanity, step forward and appeal to it. If one encounters something that is slightly dangerous or unstable, one hides deeply and avoids it for fear of harming "Ke Xu" and life. It is so for individuals, and why not for countries as well.

### After the Destruction of Tongji University, Principal Weng Discusses the Restoration Movement (with Pictures)

The Enemy Can Only Destroy Our Material Possessions; We Will Persevere to Achieve Final Victory; Choose Another Location to Start School and Continue Classes as Usual

Dr. Weng Zhilong, President of National Tongji University in Wusong, yesterday spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency who visited him, discussing the destruction of the university by the violent enemy and future plans. The reporter first inquired about the destruction of the university. According to him, the university has three colleges: medicine, engineering, and science, a

fully-fledged science and technology university, and the technical personnel trained over the years have all participated in the government's emerging construction. The well-equipped medical, engineering, and science colleges have greatly benefited the country's industrial and health undertakings. The enemy troops have been paying attention for a long time. In the January 28th Incident, some destruction already occurred. Over the years, efforts have been made to rebuild and expand. After the North China Incident occurred, the Japanese army in Shanghai repeatedly instigated incidents, ready to move. The university, mindful of

the events of January 28th and the Japanese army's destruction of cultural institutions in North China, and following the instructions of the Ministry of Education, took necessary measures to gradually transport important machinery, instruments, books, and files to safe areas for storage. After August 8th, the Japanese army used a large number of warships to threaten Shanghai, and the situation was precarious. On the 12th, enemy naval forces landed in Shanghai in large numbers, and the threat became more urgent.

The Songhu Railway traffic was interrupted. There were still more than 200 faculty, staff, and students remaining at the school. Once the conflict began, Wusong was likely to be attacked at any time. Therefore, on the one hand, we ordered the urgent removal of essential school equipment to a temporary school site rented in Shanghai. On the other hand, we deployed staff to arrange for those remaining behind and sent the remaining students to Shanghai by waterway. After all arrangements were completed, I left Song with the faculty and staff by waterway after the outbreak of the war. Later, amidst the sound of gunfire, I repeatedly

went to inspect. Japanese airplanes were constantly circling and surveying, and constantly bombarded with naval guns. After the 23rd, they concentrated bombing with aircraft. In addition to the destruction of all buildings, all the machinery and equipment that were inconvenient to move were also bombed and destroyed. The estimated loss is several million or more. At this point, the reporter, concerned about the public's interest in the future restoration of the university, asked about

future plans. President Weng then told the reporter with a very firm attitude: "The enemy's artillery fire can only destroy our material possessions, but it cannot destroy our spirit. We will persevere to achieve final victory. The government's long-term resistance requires talent urgently. The medical, engineering, and science departments of our university, which are concerned with supplementing technical personnel during this extraordinary period, cannot be stopped for a day. Regarding

the restoration movement of our university, with the support of the current educational authorities and the dedicated efforts of all faculty and students, we are quite confident. What can be announced now is that the transitional measures have been decided. School will start on September 20th at 29 Difeng Road, Shanghai, and classes will resume as usual on October 4th. As for permanent solutions, we are now planning to select

a safe area suitable for heavy industry environment and convenient transportation to build a new school. All members of the university will uphold the instructions of the education authorities and devote all our energy to the realization of this new reality. We hope that the people of the country and the media will supervise and support us." Finally, the reporter asked if it was true that German professors at the university had returned to Germany. He said that there were no German professors

currently returning to Germany. They all went to various places to escape the summer heat during the summer vacation and are currently temporarily residing abroad and in various parts of the country. As for the personal belongings of the German professors stored in the school, Mr. So-and-so, the dean of the German Engineering College, was urgently telegraphed to return to Shanghai to retrieve them when the war broke out. Therefore, there has been no significant loss.

### Qu Wenliu Appeals to Buddhists

Should Use the Sword of Wisdom to Practice Compassion, Using the Authority of Secular Law to Stop Killing with Killing

Qu Yingguang of the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee, considering that the world is now filled with murderous intent and that people are advocating using killing to stop killing, and in order to promote the great compassion of Buddhism and engage in the work of rescuing all living beings, yesterday issued a respectful message to Buddhists around the world. The message stated that the world has reached a time of tribulation, and that living beings are heavily burdened by karma, with the weak being preyed upon by the strong. Those of us who study Buddhism, taking the universal salvation of all beings as our primary goal, should ask how to develop our minds and how to work in order to save all living beings. It further pointed out that Bodhisattvas take Bodhi mind as the cause, great compassion as the root, and skillful means as the ultimate goal. These three methods are the work that all Buddhist disciples should have in response to the occasion and the time. It stated that we are shouldering the heavy responsibility of rescuing all living beings, and at this critical juncture, we should use the sword of wisdom to practice compassion, without allowing any hesitation. By using the authority of secular law to stop killing with killing, the compassion of the Buddha will surely fulfill the wishes of all Buddhist disciples, and the response will be like an echo.

### Crew Member of the Shenfu Steamer Injured by Shell

The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association of this city, together with the Public Works Department, is handling the Shenfu, a steamer which is sending refugees. It belongs to the British firm Ewo Yuen Line. Yesterday at 3:30 PM, the steamer was returning to Shanghai from Ningbo. When the ship reached the Wusongkou, there were several Japanese warships which were firing cannons indiscriminately, in aimless shooting. Our artillery also fired one or two cannons in response. When the Shenfu steamer passed through the Wusongkou, the ship was hit by a stray bullet, and the iron shrapnel scattered in all directions, causing facial injuries to the second mate. Two French police officers were also injured by the shrapnel. Fortunately, the ship was coming to Shanghai empty, without passengers on board, so others were not affected. The ship was originally scheduled to carry a large number of refugees to Ningbo again this afternoon. After the stray bullet injured the crew members, it did not dare to sail out of the port again. However, many refugees had already boarded the ship, and negotiations are now underway to order the ship to proceed to Ningbo as usual.

### Various Hometown Associations Continue to Send Away Refugees

After the start of the Shanghai war, refugees from the war zone flocked into the concessions. Various charitable organizations and groups set up places to accommodate them. The number is very large, and the supplies are substantial. Therefore, various hometown associations are devising ways to send them back to their hometowns. The details are recorded as follows:

The Taizhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has already sent three batches. One went to Hangzhou via inland river and then transferred to Taizhou. The other took foreign merchant ships to Ningbo to return to their hometowns. It is expected that all of them will be sent away within half a month. The registration office is at the mouth of the East Water and Fire Street in the French Concession.

Ninghai County used to belong to Taizhou Prefecture. Therefore, the people in charge of the hometown association are working closely with the Taizhou Fellow Villagers Association in receiving and sending away refugees, without distinction. It is said that the association's address is in the Hongkou war zone. If there are matters to be contacted, the temporary contact address is 420 Bober Road in the French Concession.

Since the Wujiang Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai established a relief association at 3-1 Tongchunfang, Baker Road, to handle the registration and sending of fellow villagers who are refugees, up to today, it has reached eight batches, with a number of more than 700 people. In the past two days, the seventh and eighth batches of more than 100 people were sent back to their hometowns.

The Wuxi Jiangyin Fellow Villagers Joint Relief Association in Shanghai has sent away more than 13,000 refugees. There are still more than 2,000 people left in the shelter. Recently, due to the hot weather and the prevalence of seasonal epidemics, there is a deep fear of transmission. Starting yesterday (the 3rd), vaccinations are being administered.

Since the outbreak of the war, the Changzhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai immediately organized refugee shelters. More than 7,000 people have been sent back to their hometowns by water and land. People continue to arrive at the shelter opposite the general association at Xieqiao, Jing'an Temple Road, and the association's address at 6 Lane 102, Tongfu Road, with several hundred people every day. However, due to the difficulty of hiring ships, a telegram has been sent to the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce to designate steamers to specialize in towing. They have also arrived in Shanghai, safely and quickly. All aspects are being considered. It is a pity that the association's finances are tight. Although fellow villagers and benefactors have donated one after another, especially Mr. Xia Qifeng's transfer of Mr. Jiang Guangtang's birthday gifts to help is of profound significance, but the daily supply of provisions requires substantial expenses. It is hoped that enthusiastic fellow villagers and benefactors will enthusiastically donate to enable this good deed to continue.

### Chamber of Commerce Announces Prohibition of Monopoly and Profiteering to All Industries

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to the industry associations, saying: "Regarding the matter of the notice, on the 2nd of this month, an instruction was received from the Bureau of Social Affairs, Special Character No. 241, stating: 'Since the outbreak of the war in this city, it has been reported that a small number of merchants are monopolizing and profiteering, raising prices, causing the value of daily necessities to skyrocket, affecting the livelihood of civilians, which is not appropriate. The overall resistance war has just begun, and the final victory depends on the brave resistance of the soldiers at the front and the compliance of the people in the rear with the norms and the stability of the market. Merchants in all industries must not monopolize and profiteer, raising prices, so as not to disturb the market. In addition to posting a notice in the city, the association is requested to clearly inform and everyone must abide by it. If anyone dares to deliberately violate it, once verified, they will be severely punished according to law and will not be lenient.' Obey immediately and instruct everyone to obey." In this regard, the chamber of commerce has already issued a circular to persuade and warn against raising prices during wartime. Now, the former is being served, and a further notice is hereby issued. It is hoped that the association will check and inform the members to abide by the order and not monopolize and profiteer, so as not to disturb the market. This is very important. The Longshan vessel has already sailed out of the port yesterday morning. The vessel carried a total of more than 4,000 Ningbo refugees, half of whom were sent from the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's shelters, and the other half were refugees from Ningbo and Shaoxing who had gathered on the docks. Before the vessel set sail, Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, personally went to the docks to take care of the refugees.

### Telephone Service in the Chinese Concession Operates Normally

Various Construction Projects Temporarily Postponed

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, telephone service in Zhabei and Wusong, etc., in this city has been disrupted because the lines are within the war zone and difficult to repair, causing the transfer connections of the Zhabei branch office to Jiangwan and the city center, etc., to be completely cut off. Telephone service in Nanshi, Pudong, Longhua, etc., can still be connected from within the concessions, but the connection between the Chinese area and the concessions is intermittent. Currently, acting Director Yu Bingjian is supervising the staff to work as usual. When a line obstruction occurs, craftsmen are immediately dispatched to repair it at risk in order to maintain traffic. As for the bureau's original plan to expand telephone stations and increase cables, etc., construction was only halfway through when the war broke out, so various projects were postponed. Whether to continue to handle it in the future will depend on how the situation develops.

### The City Joint Patrol Team Has Defined Its Routes

The Persons Responsible for Each Route Have Also Been Appointed

The First Special Citizen United Association of this city, in order to lead the market and jointly maintain order, has decided to organize a patrol team. After consultation with the Public Works Department, it is learned that the association will first conduct patrols on Nanjing Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, Fuzhou Road, Guangdong Road, Fujian Road, Xinzha Road, Avenue Edward VII, Rue Cardinal Mercier, Zhejiang Road, Avenue Edward VII, Jing'an Temple Road, Tongfu Road, Robison Road, Tianjin Road, Shandong Road, etc. After achieving results, it will be promoted again. The persons responsible for each of the above roads have also been appointed, and it has been decided to gather at 1:00 PM today to discuss the method of dividing the sections and to select the personnel for the team.

### Letter

Dear Editor, After reading the news item on page two of your newspaper on the second of this month, we were greatly surprised. We have been in the beef business for many years. Although our business is small, our patriotism is not behind others. Because our business premises happen to be in the Hongkou area, and we all have stalls for sale in the Wusong Road Triangle Small Vegetable Market, we have trade relations with Japanese merchants. However, there are no contracts and no regulations. It is completely a normal transaction. But after the Lugouqiao Incident, we, in view of the urgent national crisis, immediately severed relations with Japanese merchants. This fact is easy to prove and cannot be denied. For the sake of our own lives and those of our families, and to avoid shaming our ancestors and descendants, we hereby sincerely request your newspaper to grant a correction to correct the public's understanding. This is especially to inform you, and we are grateful, Zhang Mujin, Fei Shaojin, Hu Xiaolong, Zhang Fujin, Gong Jiaqi, Tang Xianghe.

Dear Editor, After reading your May 2nd report, "Registering Refugees' Money," it says that Zhu Yun and others organized a Changshu Temporary Relief Association and extorted donations from refugees. The person in charge of this association is Ma Leming, Lu Baoqin, etc. The extortion of donations is not a fact. It is being investigated separately. I would like to request a correction to correct the record. This is the Shen Bao Temporary Evening News, Changshu Fellow Villagers Temporary Relief Association.

### When a Huge Bomb is Detected Falling, One Should Immediately Lie on the Ground

The Indian Constable Lying Down and Not Dying Can Serve as Clear Evidence

Since the start of the Shanghai war, bombs have often affected the concession area, and many people have died. In addition to working hard to rescue the victims after the incident, the concession authorities and various charitable organizations hope that when people detect a large bomb falling, they should immediately avoid it to a suitable location and lie on the ground. Do not panic and flee. When the tragedy of the Bund of Nanjing Road occurred on the 14th, the Indian constable at the intersection command post discovered that a bomb was falling, and immediately stepped down and lay on the ground, and was spared. The police constable standing next to him was already crushed to pieces. This is a clear example. However, the authorities especially hope that people do not have to wait. Do not linger or watch in groups.
