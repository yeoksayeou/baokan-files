### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Issues Declaration Based on Treaty to Discuss Common Stance

The Sino-Japanese Dispute Is Related to All Countries in the World. Italy Opposes; Three Nordic Countries Abstain from Voting. Meeting Scheduled to Resume on the 22nd of This Month.

⊙Brussels. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a plenary session this afternoon and immediately passed a declaration. The Italian representative, Marcozzi, opposed it, stating, "The Italian government believes that this declaration will not only fail to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute but will also lead to the most serious disputes. Italy is unwilling to bear any responsibility and has therefore decided to oppose it and will reserve its attitude towards the future development of the Sino-Japanese dispute." The representatives of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden all agreed in principle with the declaration, but because their countries do not have significant interests in the Far East, there is no need to state their position. They therefore abstained from voting. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is now scheduled to continue at 3:00 PM on the 22nd of this month to consider a common attitude as stipulated in the last paragraph of the declaration. (Central News Agency, Harunas dispatch, 16th)

⊙Brussels. Key points of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference's declaration are as follows: ㊀ Expresses regret over Japan's lack of full participation. ㊁ Acknowledges that the current conflict is not merely a matter concerning China and Japan. ㊂ Declares that if Japan continues to refuse to participate, all countries must consider a common attitude. The most important difference between this declaration and the draft submitted last Saturday is that all references to the League of Nations have been deleted. When the Swedish representative abstained from voting, he expressed regret that the conference had failed to find a solution, stating that Sweden accepted the declaration in principle, but Sweden did not have as many interests in the Far East as other countries, so it decided not to participate in the vote. The Norwegian representative also made the same statement. The Danish representative spoke, first expressing regret that mediation had not been successful, and then saying that Denmark would also not declare itself by participating in the vote, but fully agreed with the principles contained in the declaration. The chief Italian representative said that the declaration opened not a door to resolution, but a door that would make the situation and disputes more serious, and Italy fully reserved its attitude for the future. British Foreign Secretary Eden is expected to return to Brussels at the end of this week to continue talks with U.S. Chief Representative Davis. French Chief Representative Tarbox will also return to Brussels at the end of this week, so at the next meeting of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, all countries will be able to fully decide on a "common attitude." The draft declaration was originally drafted by the U.S. delegation, and apart from opinions, the representatives of all countries had no objections. The wording of the declaration fully expressed the opinions that all interested countries had carefully considered. In order to encourage all countries to adopt effective economic sanctions against Japan, the Chinese representative has issued a twelve-page document explaining the outline of Japan's economic inability to exist independently from the outside world, and advocated boycotting Japanese imports and exports, blocking or boycotting Japanese shipping, and refusing to provide loans, as an effective tool for all countries to stop Japanese aggression.

The declaration states that the Union of South Africa, the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, and the Soviet Union, in view of Japan's continued assertion that the conflict between China and Japan is not within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty and its repeated refusal to exchange views in order to seek a peaceful resolution, unanimously expressed regret that Japan's views on this issue and the interests involved in the conflict are completely different from those of the rest of the world. The Government of Japan insists that the conflict between China and Japan is only related to China and Japan, while the representatives of all countries concerned believe that this conflict is related to all signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 and the Paris Pact of 1926, as well as to other countries listed in the international community. The signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty declare that they are willing to adopt the policies stipulated in the treaty in order to stabilize the situation in the Far East and agree to apply certain principles to each other in their relations with and in China, while the signatories to the Paris Pact agree never to use methods other than peaceful means to resolve disputes or conflicts of any nature or cause. All of this is undeniable. The current conflict between China and Japan not only adversely affects the rights of all countries, but also the material interests of all countries. This is also undeniable. People from third countries have died as a result, and many more are at great risk. International transportation is disrupted, the property of people from third countries is damaged, international trade is disrupted and suffers losses, and people in all countries experience panic and resentment, and are all worried and uneasy. The representatives of all countries concerned also believe that this hostile act and the situation it has created is an event that is not only related to the countries participating in the conference, but also to the whole world. In the view of the representatives of all countries concerned, this issue should not be regarded merely as a matter between two countries in the Far East, but as a matter of law and order, world security, and world peace.

The Japanese government has stated that Japan's use of force against China is intended to make China abandon its current policies. The representatives of all countries concerned must declare that no country has the legal right to use force to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. If the general public recognizes this kind of right, then conflicts will never cease. The Japanese government also said that the solution should be carried out solely by China and Japan. However, this kind of solution cannot be believed to be able to establish a fair and permanent solution. Japanese armed forces are now gathered in large numbers on Chinese territory, occupying a large and important area of China. The Japanese military authorities should claim that Japan's purpose is to destroy China's will and ability, so that it cannot resist Japan's will and demands. The Japanese government also said that it is China that violates the Nine-Power Treaty, but China is now engaged in full and frank discussions with the contracting countries, while Japan refuses to discuss with other countries. The Chinese authorities have repeatedly stated that they do not listen and, in fact, cannot negotiate with Japan alone. Therefore, in the above-mentioned environment, there is no basis to believe that separate negotiations between China and Japan can establish any solution in the near future that creates peace between the two countries, protects the rights of other countries, and ensures political and economic stability in the Far East. Not only is it impossible, but there is reason to believe that if this matter is left to China and Japan alone to negotiate, armed conflict will continue without end, and the destruction of life and property, the chaos of order, the instability of the situation, all the instability and suffering, as well as the deepening of hatred, and the disturbance of the world, will follow.

The Japanese government recently replied to the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, based on the actual situation of the situation, to make contributions to promoting stability in East Asia. In the view of the representatives of the participating countries, the true and actual situation in the situation is the above-mentioned situation. The representatives of all countries are convinced that, based on the above reasons, direct negotiations between China and Japan cannot have the hope of obtaining a fair and permanent solution. They previously sent a letter to the Japanese government, requesting consultation with representatives of all countries or representatives of several countries, to exchange views, in order to lead to the acceptance of mediation by representatives of all countries and to help facilitate negotiations for a satisfactory solution. For this reason, the representatives of the participating countries still believe that if China and Japan are willing to stop hostilities and have the opportunity to try this procedure, success is not impossible. Now the Chinese representative has expressed his readiness to follow this procedure, and the representatives of all countries concerned feel difficult to understand that Japan has always refused to discuss this method. Although the representatives of all countries concerned hope that Japan will no longer insist, they have to consider what should be the common attitude in this situation. What is this situation? A country that has signed an international treaty, regardless of the opinions of other contracting countries, always believes that its actions are not within the scope of this international treaty, and disregards other contracting countries. In this environment, it is sufficient to fulfill the still effective provisions of the treaty. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### British Parliament Discusses Status of Shanghai Concession

Undersecretary of State Says No Change; British Ambassador Asks Matsui About His Remarks

[London] At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Harris, a Liberal MP from the opposition party, inquired about the Shanghai Japanese Commander-in-Chief Matsui's statement to foreign news agency representatives on November 11 regarding the attitude towards the Public Concession. He asked what action the government had taken regarding this matter. Undersecretary of State Cranborne replied that the government had instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, to inquire with the Japanese government about their opinion on this statement. As for the news of the statement, he had not received any official confirmation. In any case, Japan had previously assured the British government that it intended to respect British rights and interests in China. According to Matsui's statement, he implicitly criticized the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession for being anti-neutral, and criticized the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai, saying that he could not cooperate with them. He also said that he did not want to take advantage of the current situation to control the Public Concession, but if the current situation continued, there might come a time when we could not cooperate with it. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 15th)

[London] The British House of Commons today discussed the issue of compensation for the damage suffered by British people in the Shanghai Public Concession due to the Sino-Japanese War. This matter was raised by Conservative MP Malleson. Malleson asked Foreign Secretary Eden if he could instruct the British Consul-General in Shanghai to do his best to assist the British people in preparing compensation claims, especially for those whose properties in Hongkou and Yangshupu had been completely destroyed. Undersecretary of State Cranborne replied that he believed that the Consul-General in Shanghai was already doing his best to assist them. The Consul-General had been instructed to assist these British people's compensation claims within the scope possible. Those whose properties in the above-mentioned two areas were occupied by the Japanese army should prepare compensation claims for any damage. All claims, whether for properties that have been bombed or for losses due to being denied entry, can be prepared. All claims should be sent to the British Consul-General immediately. Conservative MP Plutarch asked if the Japanese occupation of Shanghai had affected the status of the Public Concession. Cranborne replied that the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, which stipulate the status of the Public Concession, would not be changed by this hostile act. Apart from some occasional incidents, no foreign troops or representatives had interfered. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Japanese General Headquarters to be Established Soon

Many Members of Parliament Demand Withdrawal from the Nine-Power Treaty

[Tokyo] The issue of establishing the General Headquarters, which has been demanded by various government agencies and the public, has been satisfactorily resolved on the 15th due to the coordination of affairs between the Army and Navy authorities, and it is scheduled to be established soon. It is reported that the procedures to be followed are to first abolish the wartime General Headquarters Ordinance promulgated in the 36th year of Meiji and formulate a new military ordinance regarding the General Headquarters. The imperial edict abolishing the old General Headquarters Ordinance will be decided by the Cabinet on the 16th and immediately requested the Emperor's approval for formal publication. At the same time, the new military ordinance regarding the General Headquarters will take effect with the approval of the Army and Navy Ministers. Japan will become a purely wartime system, and all actions against China for the purpose of punishing China will become official and more active. (Alliance News Agency dispatch, 16th)

[Tokyo] The outline of the General Headquarters Order to be issued is as follows:

㊀ The current wartime General Headquarters will be promulgated by imperial edict, but this time the General Headquarters will be formulated by military order.

㊁ The previous ordinance was the "Wartime General Headquarters Ordinance," so according to general interpretation, this order only applied during wartime. The new ordinance to be issued this time is the "General Headquarters Ordinance," which clearly states in the article "applies during wartime or when an incident occurs."

㊂ Because some people have doubts about whether the General Headquarters is purely a commanding organ, this point is specifically clarified.

㊃ All other points follow the current ordinance. (Alliance News Agency dispatch, 16th)

[Tokyo] Many members of the House of Representatives issued a declaration today, demanding that Japan withdraw from the Nine-Power Treaty in response to the declaration condemning Japan by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, believing that the situation in the Far East has changed greatly in the five years since the treaty was signed, and the contracting countries still do not understand the truth of the East. The different interests of the countries in China and the decision by the majority are wrong. Japan should abolish the treaty in accordance with the policy of withdrawing from the League of Nations.

[Berlin] Former Minister of Commerce and Industry Goto Takuo, the Japanese goodwill envoy, arrived here yesterday from London. This morning, he discussed residence procedures with the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Mushanokoji. Dr. Fujino of Mitsubishi Corporation and Dr. Nagai of the South Manchuria Railway Company also participated in the talks. Goto and his party will stay in Germany for three months and plan to meet with Chancellor Hitler, but the date has not yet been decided. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 16th)

### British Soldiers Returning from Shanghai Talk About Japanese Atrocities

[London] British Welsh Guards soldiers recently returned to Southampton from Shanghai and expressed their personal impressions of the Japanese bombing. One officer said that on one occasion, when Japanese planes were bombing, the Chinese side had only one anti-aircraft gun to retaliate. The losses suffered by Shanghai were extremely heavy and it would take several years to restore it to its original state. A soldier said, in a nutshell, the Japanese were slaughtering Chinese people. From the clear impression we gained, Japan was trying to force China to surrender. Japanese planes seemed to be targeting Chinese civilians, not military facilities. I have seen several times Chinese civilians taking refuge in the train station, and Japanese planes waited until it was full before bombing with grenades. How cruel the situation was can be imagined.

### Nordic Countries Explain Their Attitudes

⊙Brussels. When the Nine-Power Treaty Conference voted on the declaration yesterday, the representatives of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark all stated that they would abstain from voting. Here are summaries of the speeches of the representatives of each country: ㊀ Swedish Representative Dattel stated that "The mediation work carried out by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has so far failed to achieve any results. The Government of Sweden deeply regrets this, even more than other countries. The political interests that Sweden has in the Far East are not as great as those of certain countries. Although it agrees with the declaration in principle, it is more convenient to abstain from voting." ㊁ Norwegian Representative Volperd declared, "Regarding the history of the peaceful mediation of the dispute between China and Japan, the Government of Norway is eager to do its utmost within the scope possible, and therefore accepted the invitation to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Unfortunately, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has not been able to achieve any results. The Government of Norway deeply regrets this. The Government of Norway fully agrees with the principles on which the declaration is based and still hopes to find a solution through mediation and on the basis of these principles, but the Government of Norway, according to the speech made by this seat on the 13th of this month, has decided to abstain from voting." ㊂ Danish Representative Goffman said, "This seat expresses its agreement with the declarations made by the representatives of Norway and Sweden. The Government of this country also deeply regrets that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has not achieved any results and hopes that a solution can still be found through mediation. Although the Government of this country expresses its agreement with all the principles contained in the declaration, it has decided to abstain from voting for the same reasons as those explained by the representatives of Norway and Sweden." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 16th)

⊙Brussels. Although Italian Representative Marcozzi made a speech and opposed the declaration when the Nine-Power Treaty Conference voted on it yesterday, it is generally believed that this is consistent with the opinions expressed by the representative at the beginning of the conference and is not unexpected. The abstention from voting by the representatives of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was a surprise to the general public. Up until the vote, Chinese representatives Gu Weijun, Guo Qinqi, and Qian Tai were still contacting the representatives of each country separately, and the main purpose of this declaration was in line with what each country had previously agreed to at the League of Nations General Assembly. It was initially unexpected that the representatives of each country only expressed agreement in principle and finally abstained from voting. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 16th)

### Ambassador Gu Weijun Has Long Talks with US Representative

Chen Gongbo Meets with Foreign Minister Ciano and is Scheduled to Meet Mussolini on the 18th

⊙Brussels. After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed the official statement, Chinese Chief Representative Gu Weijun immediately held talks with American Chief Representative Davis, which lasted for a long time. Another Chinese representative, British Ambassador Guo Qinqi, is scheduled to return to his post in London today and will return here on the 19th of this month. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 16th)

⊙Brussels. The Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference sent a kind of document to the press this evening as reference material, the content of which roughly stated that "According to the paper counting figures for the year 1936, the countries concerned can set certain measures in terms of economics and finance to stop Japanese aggression." This document was explained by a certain reporter as a suggestion put forward by the Chinese delegation to the State Public Treaty Conference, advocating boycotting Japanese goods and prohibiting certain items from being shipped to Japan. The Chinese delegation immediately and clearly denied it, and said that regarding economic and financial measures, the chief representative of the country, Dr. Gu Weijun, had explained everything at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 13th of this month, and no other suggestions had been made.

[Rome] Chinese special envoy Chen Gongbo met with Foreign Minister Ciano this morning and is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini on the 18th. He will then go to France, Belgium, England, and Germany on the 21st to contact the authorities of each country and inform the Chinese envoys of the situation in the Far East. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 16th)

[Rome] Chen Gongbo, special envoy of the Chinese government, recently met with an interviewer from the Havas News Agency and gave a speech, saying, "Italy's participation in the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has hit the good relationship between China and Italy, but China and Italy will still remain good friends." Chinese people believe that the Anti-Comintern Pact is only related to Europe and is not a problem for China. I also firmly believe that Italy will not interfere in the Far East issue in a way that is unfavorable to China. As for ceding part of China's territory to make peace with Japan, we cannot imagine it. It must be known that China has resources that are far greater than Japan, so it has no fear of continuing to fight against Japan. Also, I have not heard of any formal proposals from third countries to mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict." After participating in a grand Sino-Italian cultural event here, Chen Gongbo will leave for Brussels on the 21st of this month. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 16th)

### League of Nations Committee Prepares to Meet

[Geneva] People familiar with the news recently announced that after the Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed a declaration regarding the dispute between China and Japan, the issue may be transferred to the League of Nations Committee on Sino-Japanese Affairs for further handling. (Central News Agency, Havas, 16th)

[Geneva] After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed a declaration yesterday afternoon and decided to discuss the possibility of "common action" by various countries on Monday (the 22nd) next week, people familiar with the news here believe that the above decision clearly means that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has already prepared to transfer the Sino-Japanese incident to the League of Nations for further handling. In short, it is certain that the League of Nations Committee on Sino-Japanese Affairs will meet in Geneva between the 5th and 10th of next month. The consultation committee was originally scheduled to hold a meeting on September 4, but it has been postponed repeatedly due to waiting for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to end the boundary. According to the resolutions previously passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, if the Chinese delegation wants to convene a consultation committee, it can also request to convene it at any time.

### American Congressional Special Session: Roosevelt's Statement of Policy

Increase Average Profits and Wages, Advocate Encouraging Small Businesses, Eliminate Child Labor, Adjust Interstate Commerce

[Washington] Congress held a special session today, and President Roosevelt delivered a message, encouraging small businesses. The government's objectives are as follows: ① Raise the standard of living; ② Distribute the fruits of civilization more equitably; ③ Expand national income and distribution; ④ Promote reasonable profits and higher wages. The US President foreshadowed legislation to adjust international trade, which aims to eliminate child labor and protect workers. The US President also advocated establishing local design bureaus to preserve and develop national resources, prevent waste, and allow the nation to realize its true value. The President stated that since the adjournment of Congress in August, industrial production has shown a decline, unlike the continuous progress of the previous four years. Although the current decline has not yet reached a serious level, it is gradually reducing national income, so this matter urgently requires attention. He has consulted with many businessmen, and from these conversations, he knows that America has sufficient intelligence and talent not only to curb the current decline but also to lay the foundation for a more permanent recovery. With common sense, there is absolutely no reason for this long-term recession. Although policies may be imperfect, they can be corrected, and the overall situation is not unsatisfactory. The current task is to increase the use of private capital and create businesses that can employ labor. Private businesses, with the cooperation of the government, can advance to a level of industrial activity even higher than at the beginning of this year. If private businesses do not respond, then the government must act because of their inaction. The scope of what we can do is very broad, and cannot be fully enumerated in this speech. The President promised to make recommendations to encourage private capital to invest in large-scale construction of new houses. He continued, stating that the Congressional committee has been investigating and removing unfair points from the tax laws. We should give special consideration to reducing the burden on small business owners so that they can compete with stronger competitors and curb the increasingly prevalent monopolistic practices. As for other matters, such as railroads and public utilities, they are currently being re-examined, but because their finances have been unstable for many years, a solution is particularly difficult. The President then urged Congress to keep in mind the government's far-reaching overall goal, which is to raise the standard of living and more equitably distribute the seeds of civilization. There are many objectives related to this, but only four can be mentioned now. Two are directly related to the stability and maintenance of national purchasing power, and two are related to improving government administration and legislative bodies. This year, cotton farmers may receive the most abundant harvest in history, while those who grow miscellaneous grains, taro, and potatoes will suffer a poor harvest and be unable to support themselves. Other farmers have no method of controlling their surpluses and will also become victims, all feeling anxious and uneasy. When formulating agricultural programs, it is necessary to pay attention to the following points: ① Soil fertility; ② Economic well-being of farm families; ③ Interests of consumers; ④ Democratic trends in the United States. Agricultural programs cannot succeed and last without the active support of farmers. ⑤ If the expenses stipulated by the new rural bill exceed the amount set in the original budget, then other methods must be found to increase tax revenue. ⑥ Constitution. The whole country now feels that if we must maintain wage income and purchasing power to defend against general and industrial decline factors, then congressional action is urgently needed to pass commercial legislation concerning states and counties. Now is the time. The purpose of such legislation is ① To eliminate child labor and protect workers from overwork; ② To end some unhealthy practices in some societies. They provide more and more deserving labor than currently exists in the competitive communities to seek new industries. The President ended with a warning to those who believe that reorganizing the government is a major method of saving money, saying that major reductions in government expenses can only be achieved by reducing government services. Those who hold this view must explain which government services they propose to reduce. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters)

[Washington] Within thirty minutes of President Roosevelt's statement of policy today, Congress became restless. Republican Congressman Qiu proposed adjourning until Thursday for discussion, and then Democratic Congressman Kang proposed adjourning until tomorrow to begin debate. There was no dissent. (15th, National Telegram)

[Washington] Newspapers predict that plans to reduce taxes and assist industry will be the most important issues of this special session of Congress. Once this plan is realized, although it will not completely restrict the development of the government's original programs, it will hinder their progress. (16th, Central News Agency, Reuters)

[New York] Wall Street figures commented on President Roosevelt's proposals to revitalize commerce, believing that there were no concrete measures. However, authoritative sources felt that this was not because the US President was unwilling to cater to the demands of the business community, but because he did not want to create the impression that he was being forced to concede. Therefore, future developments will more clearly reflect the government's readiness to cooperate with the business community. At the same time, some people also said that the US President wants to wait for an opportunity to directly contact Congress in order to understand the interests of the whole country and then decide on a policy direction. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

### Japan's Wartime Financial Situation

[Nanjing] With the Sino-Japanese war in progress, how Japan's next year's budget will be compiled is truly a major issue. Will the general budget be suppressed due to huge war expenses, or will both be considered? According to recent news, the budget requests submitted by various Japanese ministries now reach a huge sum of 3.8 billion yen, an increase of about 900 million yen compared to this year. However, financial authorities feel that it is impossible to raise funds for such a huge sum. The digestion capacity of public bonds has reached saturation. Nine-tenths of next year's war expenses must still rely on public bonds. If the financial resources for the ordinary budget rely too much on public bonds, then war expenses will inevitably be affected. Therefore, a policy has been decided that the total amount of next year's budget must be below 2.8 billion yen, a reduction of about 100 million yen compared to this year. The financial authorities are now examining the budget submitted by various ministries according to this policy. Generally, it is observed that since the budget is compiled in wartime, it may not cause major waves. Approximately, what is reduced is still ordinary government expenses, while military spending will not be affected in any way. As for next year's war expenses, they will probably not be submitted until the end of December, as it depends on how the war situation is at that time. Of the 2.56 billion yen war expenses against China, 140 million yen came from tax increases, and the remaining 2.4 billion yen were all borne by the Bank of Japan. The Bank of Japan will then observe the market's digestion capacity and issue some small-denomination public bonds so that the general public can also distribute some. It is planned to issue them three times in total: the first time 200 million yen, the second time 100 million yen, and the third time 200 million yen. Now, it is planned to issue 500 million yen of war expense public bonds this month. If so, the amount of war expense public bonds distributed to the market by the Bank of Japan this year will reach 1 billion yen. Combined with the 200 million yen of deficit public bonds already issued this year (that is, public bonds to supplement the shortage of the ordinary budget), the total amount of public bonds that the Japanese market can digest this year is 1.2 billion yen. Of the 3.3 billion yen of deficit public bonds and war expense public bonds that should be issued this year, the market can only digest about one-half, and the remaining two-thirds are in the hands of the Bank of Japan.

### Japanese-Russian Dispute

[Moscow] Mr. Nishi, a councillor at the Japanese Embassy in Russia, met with Mr. Gazirovsky, the Minister of the Far East, on the 13th to promote the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty and urge the Soviet side to reconsider. He again met with him on the 14th regarding the issue of the Soviet authorities forcibly relocating 300,000 Koreans residing in the Far East. He stated that recently, a large number of Koreans in the Primorsky Krai region have been forcibly relocated to the Turkestan region, and these Koreans are of Japanese nationality. The arbitrary coercion by Soviet officials is difficult to ignore in light of Article 4 of the basic treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union (freedom of residence and travel), and he specifically lodged a serious protest, etc. Minister Gazirovsky excused himself regarding the above protest and did not give a definite answer. The Japanese side strongly demanded that the Soviet Union find a solution. (15th, Allied News)

### Major European Diplomatic Activities

British Lord Privy Seal to Visit Germany Early, King of Belgium and Queen Arrive in London, Foreign Minister to Visit Poland and the Little Entente

[London] Lord Privy Seal Halifax set off for Germany at 2 p.m. today. Before leaving, he had a lengthy conversation with Foreign Secretary Eden this morning, consulting on exchanging views with key figures in the German political circles. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)

[London] The diplomatic correspondent of The Times stated that rumors have been spreading recently that the visit of Lord Privy Seal Halifax to Germany has always been uncertain. This kind of rumor obviously has an effect. Halifax went to Berlin a day early in order to dispel rumors and prevent obstacles from arising. The diplomatic correspondents of the Daily Mail and the News Chronicle both said that the British government intends to have Germany return to the League of Nations. The methods of enticing them are said to be the reform of the League of Nations, the deletion of the first articles of the Treaty of Versailles, and the redistribution of mandated territories. The Daily Telegraph and the News Chronicle, on the other hand, said that Mr. Halifax's trip is only an opportunity for the British and German governments to exchange views in order to probe the extent of the willingness to reach a compromise and the plans for an agreement. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

[Paris] Today, the Paris Weekly Voice commented on the visit of British Lord Privy Seal Halifax to Germany, saying that whether the German leader's explanation can be satisfactory in spirit is doubtful. It also said that even if Germany's policies can be seen clearly, in fact, the importance of Halifax's trip is still doubtful. The newspaper further stated that today, one must choose between two options: either the German leader will partially reveal himself and restrain British optimism, or he will complete his plan, but at that time, if the British side does not have a corresponding response, then he will feel that he has the situation under control and will act on his own. The Victory newspaper requested regarding this matter that someone would venture to predict that England and France would maintain their cooperation on common policies to build a united Europe, free from the disturbance of ideal conflicts and the nightmare of war, and would prepare for cooperation in economic and financial construction as urgently needed by various ethnic groups. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

[London] The King and Queen of Belgium arrived at Dover Harbour today aboard the Prince Albert. There was a grand welcome there. Many people were waiting on the famous white cliffs for the ship carrying the King to enter the harbor. After the King and Queen disembarked, they took a car to London to visit the King and Queen of England for a four-day visit. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

### Fierce Battles Near Changshu After We Abandoned Kunshan

The Enemy at Jiashan Was Blocked at Qixing Bridge, Enemy Troops Tried to Invade Pingwang by Water, The Center of the War Has Shifted to the Lake District

After the enemy troops landed in large numbers at Baimaokou the night before last, they fled south to Zhitang. At the same time, the enemy at Liuhe and Jiading advanced north. As a result, Hengjing, Fuqiao, Luhe, Hupu, Guijiazhuang, Luduqiao, and other towns fell one after another. Our army in Taicang was attacked from both sides and had no choice but to make a strategic retreat, firmly defending the Qingyang Port-Kunshan line. The enemy troops continued to put pressure from Waigang, Penglang Town, and other places. The enemy on the front also advanced along the railway line, crossing Tianfu'an, Lujiabang, and advancing to attack our Kunshan. Due to the retreat of the Qingpu line, our army's position at Kunshan Qingyang Port was attacked on three sides and was also in an untenable situation. However, our army remained calm and fought back resolutely, showing no timidity. The night before last, the enemy, under the cover of intense artillery fire, crossed Qingyang Port with a large mechanized force and launched a fierce attack on Kunshan. A bloody battle unfolded throughout the day and night, with exceptionally heavy casualties on both sides. Our army still firmly defended Kunshan Station and Kunshan City, refusing to retreat. In the end, due to the destruction of fortifications and the lack of defenses, they painfully left Kunshan and retreated along the railway line. They have now established a position on the Weiting Zhengyi front line, preparing to inflict a heavy blow on the enemy. The enemy at Zhitang also crossed the Baimao River to the north yesterday, and a large force advanced along the Xihou Highway, attempting to invade Changshu. At this moment, our enemy armies are engaged in fierce battles east of Changshu. Dozens of enemy warships on the Nantong River surface concentrated their fire on our Fushan defense, threatening the side of Changshu, with minimal losses. The enemy who landed at Jinshanwei also advanced in two routes. Those who advanced along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway were heavily attacked by our army at Jiashan Station and fled in disorder near Wangjiangjing on the Sujia Railway. They are still surrounded by our army. Another route of enemy troops attempted to invade Pingwang Town on the Sujia Railway by water, attempting to cut off the communication between our army's Sujia strongholds and simultaneously approach Suzhou. Our army has seen through their scheme, and a large force is attacking them fiercely. The enemy advancing west from Quan Gongting and Xincang was repelled by our army east of Pinghu. Pinghu is still firmly defended by our army. This new defense line of our army stretches from Jiangkou Fushan, passing through Changshu Suzhou, along the Sujia Railway, to Jiaxing, Pinghu, and Zhapu, a total length of more than 110 kilometers. The position is exceptionally strong. In this Taihu area, rivers crisscross and lakes and swamps are everywhere. If the enemy troops advance deep, the mechanized forces will inevitably lose their effectiveness and will then be trapped in a desperate situation.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th, Reuters. According to Chinese sources today, after the Chinese army withdrew from Jiading and Taicang, they are now fighting the Japanese army near Kunshan on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The main force of the Japanese army is currently advancing northwest along the Sujia Highway and is reportedly being blocked at Jiashan. The Chinese army there is currently advancing towards Pinghu. A large Chinese army is now gathered near Suzhou, with its left wing guarding the fortified position near Fushan and its right wing guarding the position near Jiaxing and Jiashan. The Chinese army in the Jiaxing area is commanded by Zhang Fakui. The Chinese army's second line of defense is near Wuxi.

### The Enemy at Jiashan Invades Along the Railway

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 15th. Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pingwang, and Zhapu have been bombed by enemy aircraft for days, and most of the civilian houses have been destroyed. The enemy at Jiashan invaded along the railway line on the evening of the 14th. They were intercepted by us near Qixing Bridge, and fierce fighting continued until noon on the 15th. The battle situation at Pingwang was also fierce. Our position was once broken through by the enemy, and we are now counterattacking.

### The Enemy Invades Wangjiangjing and Pingwang

The Central News Agency said that the enemy troops on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line launched a frontal attack. After being counterattacked and driven back by our army at Jiashan, the enemy suffered heavy losses and knew that they could not attack lightly. They then changed their attack to the left flank, attacking Wangjiangjing and Pingwang. These two places are important strongholds of our national defense line on the Sujia Railway line. The defense fortifications are very solid, and there are lakes and swamps as their barriers. Therefore, although the enemy troops have approached the area, it is difficult for them to succeed.

### Pinghu Is Still in the Hands of Our Army

On the right flank of our army, the enemy also invaded in large numbers yesterday. The enemy invaded our Jiaxing and Pinghu lines in two routes. Due to the bloody battles fought day and night at Jiaxing by our army, and also due to the fleeing of the enemy troops at Wangjiangjing, they also moved slightly westward yesterday. They are now deploying positions at Qixing Bridge and other places six kilometers east of Jiaxing. After being surrounded by our army, the enemy at Wangjiangjing fled west along the Sujia Road to Pingwang. The enemy troops then fled from Songjiang along small roads to various places, planning to land in Pingwang. Our army's fortifications on the Sujia Railway are very solid. The few remaining enemies at Wangjiangjing and Pingwang have all been surrounded and cleared by our army. The entire Sujia Railway line has now become stable. The line southwest of Jiaxing is also very solid. Pinghu is still in the hands of our army. The enemy troops have invaded from Xincang and other places several times yesterday, but they have all been repelled by our army.

### The Enemy Plans to Land at Zhapu and Haiyan

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 16th. At noon on the 14th, a part of the enemy troops at Shengdiantai between Zhapu and Haiyan took the opportunity to secretly cross over and land, but they were repelled by us. On the 14th, more than 20 enemy warships in the Yuyao sea area continuously fired at Haiyan and Yaoyang and other places. Enemy aircraft also constantly scouted along the coast of Yuyao, seeming to have intentions.

### The Enemy Builds an Airfield at Sijing Stadium

The Dagong News stated that the enemy troops in the eastern Shanghai district have been building a large-scale airfield near the Sijing stadium for days. It covers an area of nearly two to three hundred acres, stretching east from Yinhang Town to the Songhu Road, and north from Lijiazhai to Yinxiang Road. The civilian houses and fields in the area have now been completely cleared. In addition, the refugees in the area who failed to escape have all been detained by them and are being used for digging mud and filling soil.

### Our Army Transfers to a New Position

Confronting the Enemy at Zhengyi

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 16th. Since our army voluntarily retreated from the south bank of the Suzhou River to Qingpu on the 9th, although the enemy at that time tracked and advanced, when they reached the outskirts of Qingpu City, they were once fiercely intercepted by our reinforcements, and the enemy suffered heavy losses at that time. A certain division commander of our army also led his troops to firmly defend the city to cover our army's retreat. Because the enemy could not advance rapidly in that area, they changed their attack to fierce bombardment of our important strongholds from Liuhe and Anting and other places. At the same time, they also attacked south from Songjiang towards Jiashan, hoping to affect our entire line of defense. In order to avoid the protrusion of the position and to allow the enemy to penetrate deep into the interior, so as to annihilate their main force, our army ordered the entire line to retreat west of Taicang and Jiading to a new position for defense. At the same time, Kunshan was repeatedly bombed by the enemy, becoming scorched earth and defenseless. They advanced to Zhengyi (also written as Zhenyi) and are currently confronting the enemy there. Our new defense line stretches north from Hupukou and Changshu to Zhengyi, along Qingpu to the southwest, all the way to Jiaxing Pinghu and finally to Zhapu, with a total length of over 100 kilometers. It is equipped with a strong military force. Our senior officers are all commanding on the front line. The morale of the entire line is very high, and they are determined to severely punish the enemy in front of our new defense line.

### Seven Enemy Warships Moored at South Huangpu

The enemy gunboat Seta and a destroyer are moored at the Jinliyuan Wharf. Five enemy gunboats, including the Akashi, Katata, Hozu, Hira, and Atami, are moored on the river surface south of the 16th Bund blockade line.

### Enemy Warships Bombard Zhenhai

The Bombardment Lasted More Than Ten Hours and Stopped Yesterday Morning, The Landing Attempt Failed, and the Situation Remains Tense

Central News Agency said that more than ten enemy warships are gathered outside the mouth of the Yong River, again attempting to land and harass our eastern Zhejiang. We were prepared early and closed the mouth of the river. At around 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, enemy warships suddenly lined up outside the mouth and launched hostilities against both sides of Zhenhai, with very loud artillery fire. We also returned fire, and the battle lasted more than ten hours, stopping yesterday morning. The enemy has not yet achieved its landing objective, but the situation there is very tense. Therefore, navigation has been temporarily suspended.

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 16th. More than ten enemy warships suddenly bombed both sides of Zhenhai at around 4 p.m. on the 15th outside the mouth of the Yong River. We also returned fire, and the fierce battle lasted more than ten hours, stopping on the morning of the 16th. The landing attempt has not yet succeeded, but the situation remains very tense.

### Detailed Account of the Enemy's Bombing of Zhenhai

Huadong News said that since the news spread that enemy aircraft bombed the north bank of the Ningbo River on the 12th, the Yong natives in Shanghai were greatly shocked. A certain gentleman of the Yong natives in Shanghai specially sent a commissioner, Mr. X, to take the Endeavor wheel to Yong on the 13th to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Because Zhenhai Port was blockaded, the original plan was to change the ship's course to Zhoushan and then transfer passengers to Chuanshan to take a car to Yong. At 4 a.m. on the 14th, the Endeavor wheel had arrived in Zhoushan. Suddenly, a report was received that Zhenhai Port had not been completely blockaded. For the convenience of passengers, it returned to Zhenhai and went directly to the north bank of the Yong River. At first, Mr. X planned to return to Shanghai on the original ship to report the findings in detail to the Yong natives in Shanghai. However, the ship received orders from the authorities yesterday, so it could not return to Shanghai as scheduled. Therefore, Mr. X was also stranded in Yong. A long-distance telephone call was made to Shanghai yesterday morning, reporting that at 0:05 noon on the 12th, five enemy aircraft were spotted in the sky over Yong, taking off from outside Zhenhai Port and flying directly to the railway station, dropping a total of eight bombs. Those bombed included the storage area on Yongcao Road, the Hua'an Hotel, the residence of old Jiaqiu on Hengshan, Tianfuzhan Lane, the back alley of Hengyuli on Manao Road, Lijie, Delanchi, Zheng's bungalow, and Majiafangzi. The Tongyun bus station was also bombed, and three bombs were also dropped at Kongpu Station, all hitting the target. Three sailboats from Yuyao to Yong were parked on the river surface at Zhanggong Temple Pier and were bombed and sunk. In this battle, more than 200 houses were destroyed, mostly those that collapsed from the shock. More than 40 people were killed and 57 injured, all of whom were being rescued and treated by the Red Swastika Society, the Red Cross Society, and various hospitals. Mr. X has prepared a detailed investigation table.

### Customs Authorities Plan to Respond to the Seizure of Patrol Vessels

The Seized Patrol Vessels Are All Regarded as War Booty, Dozens of Small Steamers Are Towed to the Mitsubishi Wharf

Central News Agency reported that twelve of our customs patrol vessels, including the Fuxing, Jiaoxing, Liuxing, Huaxing, and Lianxing, which were moored on the Bund outside the French Concession, were forcibly seized by the enemy at 10:30 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 15th). In addition to expelling all Chinese and foreign staff on board, the enemy troops raised the Japanese flag on all the vessels. Since yesterday morning (the 16th), the enemy has used many small steamships to tow one of the patrol vessels to No. 1 Buoy at Lujiazui and three to No. 4 Buoy. The largest of them, the Fuxing, was also towed to the river surface outside Lujiazui yesterday morning at around 9 a.m. by three small steamships operated by the enemy. It is reported that the patrol vessels moored on the Bund outside the French Concession that have not yet been towed away will also be towed away by the enemy one after another.

The Shenshi News reported that twelve patrol vessels of the Jianghai Customs, including the Wenxing, Fuxing, Jiaoji, and Haiguang, had not sailed out of Wusong Port to avoid danger after the Shanghai war and were moored on the river surface near the Bund of the French Concession. Suddenly, when the enemy troops occupied Nanshi in recent days, they completely seized the twelve patrol vessels on the 15th. There are a total of more than 400 Chinese tax police and 50 Western customs officers belonging to these vessels. They gathered in the customs yesterday morning to discuss post-disaster measures and listen to news. It is reported that the enemy has regarded these patrol vessels as war booty and has already sailed them to Songkou. There are also many machine guns and various military supplies for anti-smuggling purposes on each vessel, all of which have been seized. The customs authorities are currently discussing countermeasures and are unwilling to express anything for the time being.

Central News Agency reported that dozens of our small steamships originally moored south of the blockade line at the Ninghao Wharf on the 16th Bund. After the blockade line was breached by the enemy, in the past two days, the enemy used ships to tow our small steamships moored in South Huangpu to the Mitsubishi Wharf. Each ship was flying the Japanese flag. The Zhonghe merchant ship of ours, which was originally moored in South Huangpu and towed away by the enemy, has now been towed by the enemy to No. 24 Buoy.

### Enemy Admits Naval Officer Killed by Bomb

Osaka Asahi Shimbun, November 11th, reports: The naval air corps has been cooperating with the army in operations daily. In the early hours of the 9th, they flew to the Songjiang and Qingpu areas for bombing. Unexpectedly, on the 8th, Chief Petty Officer Mase of the naval air corps (from Aichi Prefecture), regarded as a treasure within the naval air corps, flew to the Songjiang area for reconnaissance and unfortunately died in action. It is learned that this Chief Petty Officer was the most outstanding air force warrior in our (self-proclaimed Japanese) naval air corps, famous throughout the country. His unfortunate death is deeply mourned by all sides. It is also reported that when our army (Japanese army) landed on Hangzhou Bay, a certain aircraft piloted by Naval Air Corps Petty Officer Hayakawa was also sacrificed. Because the aircraft was obscured by dense clouds over the Chinese military positions in Hangzhou Bay, it suddenly crashed.

### Yesterday a Total of Thirty-Two Enemy Warships Were Docked in Shanghai

According to investigations, the enemy warships docked in Shanghai yesterday, besides the cruiser "Izumo" still moored at buoy number two, there were also two torpedo boats, moored at the Bund of the Qujiang Wharf and the China Merchants Bureau Hua Zhan gunboat, two moored at the Mitsubishi Wharf and the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong, six destroyers, moored at buoys numbers 44, 43, 8, 7, 1, and the Mitsui Wharf. In addition, six enemy gunboats and one destroyer were moored in the South Huangpu, plus fourteen transport ships. Therefore, a total of thirty-two enemy warships were docked in Shanghai yesterday.

### Our Troops Headed to the Eastern Front for Reinforcement

Since the outbreak of the war on the Eastern Front, nearly three months have passed. The enemy has been reinforcing troops almost daily, invading our various front lines. The military authorities on our side, in view of the enemy's sharp increase in troops and in order to strengthen defensive forces, have also transferred elite troops to the front line to fight. The illustration shows the magnificent scene of a certain elite unit of our army departing for the front line.

### Various Charity Organizations Inspect Refugee Areas in Nanshi

Various Facilities Implemented One After Another. Military Cleaning Campaign to be Held Soon. Representatives of Various Military and Civilian Groups Jointly Console Father Jacquinot.

The Joint Association of Charity Organizations in this city, Jisheng Society, Catholic Progressive Association, Chinese Child Welfare Association, YMCA, and other five organizations, dispatched representatives at 10 a.m. yesterday to go to the Nanshi refugee area for inspection, accompanied by representatives of the International Relief Committee, and to console Father Jacquinot. The details are as follows:

A Glimpse of the Office: The representatives of the six organizations gathered at the International Relief Committee on the third floor of the YMCA at 10 a.m. yesterday and then departed by vehicle, passing through the Xin Kai River Iron Gate and arriving directly at the North District Fire Brigade on Anren Street, where the refugee area office is located. The fire brigade building has three floors. Father Jacquinot's office is on the third floor, and the second and first floors are used as offices for staff and food storage areas.

Various Facilities in the Area: After the representatives met with Father Jacquinot, they expressed their condolences on behalf of the 200,000 refugees in the area. Father Jacquinot humbly declined and said that standing on the ground of humanitarianism, it was his duty to do so. Father Jacquinot then described to the representatives the three major problems of the refugee area: food supply, sanitation, and medical care, all of which had been addressed, expressing his immense gratitude. He also detailed the various facilities in the area as follows: (1) Paying attention to the hygiene of the refugees in the area, with the Chinese Jisheng Society, Red Swastika Society, and other charity groups responsible for sanitation in different areas. (2) Food supply is managed by Mr. Ba Yunshi, a Westerner, with the assistance of Fathers Jia, Bu, Fu, and Guan, and various charity groups in distributing supplies. (3) Security in the area is maintained by the priests and firefighters, with the French authorities dispatching several Chinese and Western detectives to patrol the area every night to prevent petty theft. (4) About 5,000 refugees from the Min Guo Road area were persuaded yesterday to enter the various shelters in the refugee area.

Order is Extremely Well Maintained: The order in the refugee area has been further enhanced by the enthusiastic cooperation of all the firefighters in the Shanghai South District. A small number of thieves have also been eliminated. It is now impossible for unscrupulous people to mingle in the refugee area. According to Father Jacquinot, a major fire broke out in Xiao Dongmen the day before yesterday, posing a threat to the Fangbang Road area of the refugee area. Fortunately, Father Jacquinot negotiated with the French Concession Fire Brigade to connect to the concession's tap water with a very long hose, which was used for firefighting and ultimately preserved the area. However, please do not move freely beyond the designated cordon. The representatives then toured the refugee area for a week and returned, expressing their great satisfaction. The refugees appeared to be at ease and not as miserable as imagined outside. Shops such as pancake stores, sauce shops, incense and candle shops, clothing stores, cobblers, and carpenters all went about their work as if nothing had happened. The refugees lingering in the Min Guo Road area have all been placed in shelters, and there are few left wandering the streets. Father Jacquinot repeatedly urged that well-meaning people no longer throw food over the iron fences, as this could easily cause disturbances among the refugees and lead them to touch the cordon, endangering them. Therefore, if you want to donate food, please send it to the Third Shelter of the Association. Please also avoid perishable food.

Drinking Water is No Longer a Problem: Regarding the refugees' meals, dry food is distributed twice a day, the first time at 9 a.m. and the second time at 2 p.m., which is sufficient to feed the refugees. The drinking water problem has been solved by the French Concession connecting three large tap water faucets, one at Xin Kai River, one at Lao Bei Men, and one at Fangbang Road, so there is no longer a problem. As for food supplies, many parties have been enthusiastically sending food to the association in recent days, which is enough for several days' needs. Yesterday, 600 refugees from Caohejing were also sent to the Guangfu Temple shelter in the refugee area.

Sheltering Homeless Refugees: Yesterday, the Relief Committee sent Jiang Zhiqing and more than ten others to persuade the refugees gathered along Min Guo Road. Among those who were sheltered were 2,000 Chinese and Japanese, 459 at Guangfu Temple, 300 at Jishen Temple, 80 at Haichuan Primary School, 50 at Huimeng Primary School, 300 at the Second District Fire Brigade, 500 at the Mosque, 200 at the Taoist Shelter, 500 at the Jewellery Guild, 150 at the Sugar Industry Guild, 80 at 72 Wutong Street, 70 at the Yimiao Police Station, and 280 at San Mao Ge. The association provides daily sustenance to all the above locations.

Implementing a Cleaning Campaign: The Relief Committee has scheduled to implement a cleaning campaign in the refugee area starting today, in conjunction with various charity groups. It is now learned that the Jisheng Society has appointed Feng Yangshan and Zhang Xianqing, the United Relief Committee of Charity Organizations has appointed Lu Deshen and Chen Youqi, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association has appointed Gu Jisheng, the Catholic Progressive Association has appointed Lu Bohong, and the Red Swastika Society has appointed Zhang Lanping. The Association has designated areas, prepared cleaning equipment, and supervised the workers and refugees to carry out the cleaning. The corpses in the area are now being searched by the priests and then sent to Pushan Villa for collection and burial. There are many sick refugees and children with measles in the area. The nuns of the various Catholic churches are temporarily taking care of them. The Association is currently planning to request assistance from the Concession Health Authorities and various health organizations to establish a larger refugee hospital as soon as possible to enhance relief efforts.

Preparing to Improve Food Supplies: People from all walks of life are concerned about the disaster victims and are donating money and goods to the Association in an endless stream. The Association has received more than 6,000 yuan in donations and a large amount of food from various circles yesterday. Many agencies and organizations have also contacted the Association to arrange for the supply of food for a week or ten days. Once the Association has collected a considerable amount of funds and has a smooth source of food, it plans to prepare porridge, rice, and vegetables for the refugees.

Resettling Refugees from Pudong: Many refugees from the Sanlin, Chenxing, Yangzhong, and other three districts of Pudong, as well as the Central River area, have come to Shanghai to seek refuge and are facing many problems with food and clothing. Yesterday, Yao Huiquan, Zhao Panshi, Zhou Xiaoshan, and others invited local enthusiastic leaders Qin Yanqi, Tang Zihua, Chen Zixin, Kang Xitao, and others to gather for discussion and established the Three Districts Refugee Relief Association to carry out relief work in groups. Qiao Juren, Zhao Chongwen, Miss Kong, and others have now been appointed to rush to compile a register of fellow villagers in the refugee area, gather them in the main hall of the City God Temple, and distribute supplies according to the register.

Red Swastika Society Relief Team: In order to facilitate the relief work in the refugee area, the Red Swastika Society has specially set up a temporary office for the relief team in the area and started work several days ago. Temporary treatment for refugees has been set up, focusing on cleanliness and providing drinking water. In addition to distributing supplies itself, the relief team takes care of and helps distribute bread and rice delivered by various parties day and night. The team has also rescued 35 elderly, young, male, and female injured people and sent them to the various hospitals of the association for treatment, rescued dozens of refugees from dangerous places, and buried several corpses.

Receiving Point for Food Supplies: The International Relief Committee stated that the number of refugees sheltered in the refugee area has reached more than 100,000. Since people from all walks of life have been enthusiastically donating food supplies, the items sent to the association every day are piled up like mountains. In order to facilitate storage, starting from today, please send all donated food supplies directly to the Third Shelter of the Association at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Luson. If you are donating cash, please still send it to Room 318, Third Floor, YMCA, Eight Immortals Bridge. This is specially noted again to facilitate donations from all walks of life.

### The Serious Refugee Problem

— Dichen

Under the magnificent resistance war, our army finally withdrew from Nanshi. Some of the general public in Nanshi who did not evacuate had already suffered from the war, and some, although spared death under the cruel artillery fire, have become homeless refugees with broken homes and deceased families.

Although there are no exact statistics on the number of these homeless refugees, according to estimates from various parties, the total number should not be less than 100,000. They wander the streets, without shelter or food in the harsh winds and rain. What a tragic scene this is!

Now, with the efforts of the International Relief Committee and the enthusiastic relief from all walks of life, noodles and sesame cakes have been delivered in a steady stream, and tap water has also been connected from the French Concession. These 100,000 or so refugees have finally received temporary relief in terms of food. Although the strange phenomenon of "the strong搶ing more and the old and weak not eating" has occurred in the meantime, this is only a defect occurring in "unorganized relief," which can be resolved immediately with a little attention to the technique of distribution if organized relief can be carried out. It is by no means a worrying problem. The worrying problem is how to deal with it in the future.

In the emergency situation where refugees have no shelter and no food, donating food and clothing to relieve their immediate needs is naturally an urgent and unavoidable task and a commendable righteous act. However, let us not forget that this is only temporary relief and by no means a sustainable solution. Because humanitarian assistance can alleviate the immediate situation, but economic constraints will make it impossible to continue. The donation of noodles and sesame cakes from all walks of life may not be a problem today or tomorrow, but it will definitely not be sustainable for a long time. Therefore, the question for the future is how to enable these refugees to each find their place and not require the relief of others. This is the question of how to deal with the refugees in the future.

How will these 100,000 refugees be dealt with in the end? The unemployed need to be given jobs. Although the nature of refugees is different from that of the unemployed and is more serious, the need of refugees to have a job is no different from that of the unemployed. Therefore, if refugees can be provided with jobs, it may not be impossible to find some solution to the handling of refugees. However, "giving jobs" is already a difficult problem to solve in peacetime in various capitalist countries, let alone in today's extraordinary times of fierce fighting, when various businesses are shrinking under the threat of airplanes and artillery, making it even more difficult to talk about?

So what should we do? In fact, we can already see that some hometown associations have begun the work of sending refugee villagers back to their hometowns, which is naturally one of the solutions in the absence of other options. However, this is only a small part of the refugees, what about the refugees who have no hometown to return to? Here, let us put forward the following suggestions:

First, register all refugees.

Second, make appropriate arrangements according to their age, skills, and aspirations.

Third, the government should designate a suitable location as a refugee resettlement area to allow them to engage in farming, which can both enrich the people's food supply during the war and solve the refugees' livelihood.

Fourth, strong and able-bodied individuals should be transferred to suitable locations, trained, and assigned to construct defense works or engage in other rear-area work.

Naturally, there are still many difficulties in implementing these measures, and they are by no means the most fundamental and appropriate methods. The most fundamental method is to strengthen our strength of resistance, consolidate our front lines, and proceed steadily, without situations like Shanghai happening!

### ### The North-China Daily News on the Position of Shanghai

Residents of All Countries Should Uphold Their Interests Here; Study Practical Issues and Seek Joint Cooperation

The North-China Daily News published an editorial yesterday, discussing the position of Shanghai, stating: "We are not surprised that the official opinion in London does not want to make a big fuss about the issues that Shanghai residents are particularly concerned about. It would be most unwise to have a formal discussion about this today. Even if we start partially in an obviously humble way, it would be the same. We should not engage in speculation until we can accurately measure the final outcome of the current crisis based on existing or future facts, as it would only waste time and energy. Shanghai residents should disregard this concern. They have special reasons. When the time comes for the needs of Shanghai's future to receive diplomatic attention, the speed of discussing this matter may startle the people closely involved. They may express regret that they cannot defend themselves based on the theory determined by the results of studying the city's current situation. If the commonly recognized position of Shanghai is regarded as a purely political event that develops in the new situation resulting from the Sino-Japanese War, it would be manifestly unfair. There is no doubt that this matter will be among the issues to be addressed in any final negotiations. However, if two of Shanghai's three municipal areas do not bear direct responsibility for this war, and all their interests cannot be handled by the two leaders without consulting other parties, then Shanghai has the necessity to be treated specially. This is regarded as an appropriate way to acknowledge the achievements of foreigners in Shanghai. The hard work of foreigners has made Shanghai the sixth largest city in the world, and their contribution is truly great."

"When overseas people are involved in this matter, there is a tendency to disregard that Shanghai is not only a Chinese city where foreign commerce has a firm foothold, but also a corner where a fixed international policy is flourishing. Shanghai residents, whether they are Chinese, Japanese, British, American, French, German, Italian, Scandinavian, Belgian, Portuguese, Russian, or some other major element of this cosmopolitan community, truly enjoy a prominent position as citizens of this city. Although they have other loyalties, their citizenship is as important as their nationality. The interests created as a result involve the lives and existence of a huge number of families. They have no other place to turn to in their lives except Shanghai. They are not like migratory birds, who, although beneficial in their progress, ultimately regard their homeland as their final destination. Governments of various countries, which strive to promote civilized international connections, often do not give sufficient attention to the possibility of being moved by the cosmopolitanism of this city. Recently, an American official publicly praised this spirit of Shanghai, detailing how he felt that the cooperation of all sectors of Shanghai in his special activities was more resolute than in his own country. Therefore, Shanghai residents have the right to uphold their interests here, and they should be considered in the sense that they themselves recognize, and should be placed in perspective alongside the study of political issues, which arise from the unavoidable reality that this city is located within China and under Chinese sovereignty."

"The practical issue that Shanghai residents should study today is how to prepare to take a stand so that they can make a real contribution to the decision on the future status of Shanghai when the temporary suspension of discussion mentioned in London is no longer valid. This requires taking into account the different interests of people of all countries in Shanghai, and especially focusing on the fact that the International Settlement, in Shanghai's trinity, is the hub of its position. The reporter's remarks are not to belittle the importance of the French Concession or the Shanghai Municipal Government area (currently under Japanese control), but because the international status of the International Settlement currently involves various issues that are jointly related to the three municipal areas, and each still has its own special significance. Therefore, the resolution of the difficulties of the International Settlement will be the touchstone of the overall integrity of Shanghai. There is no need to shy away from the fact that this issue will be subject to serious examination. Shanghai now needs a way to restore confidence in its economic, social, and political survival. An important factor in this effort is to demonstrate the ability to implement effective plans to protect the life of this city and prevent the recurrence of the disasters of January 28th and August 13th, as only human foresight can work to achieve this goal. Today, people often say that the disasters of January 28th and August 13th were partly due to the irregularities of the Shanghai system, and some say that the unchanging land regulations that make up the International Settlement are also a contributing factor to these disturbances. It is not possible to hastily decide whether it is right to list this matter as a fundamental factor in the problem because of the blame, especially because the Municipal Council, despite its alleged shortcomings, is still striving to perform its expected duties. However, there are things that must be acknowledged: this matter requires a comprehensive and careful study, and public discussion is ineffective. Although it does not lose the value of ordinary newspaper commentary, it does not seem to receive the support of responsible parties. The best way to discuss this matter seems to be to encourage all parties to pay attention to the issue in an informal way, by those who are highly respected and well-intentioned in various societies. These gentlemen should know that the matter is imminent and should take action quickly. If they still do not take action, then there is a real danger."

### ### Fire in Nanshi Losses No Less Than Zhabei

Areas Along the Bund Burned to the Ground; More Than Half of the Inner City Turns to Scorched Earth; Hundreds of Houses Destroyed in Pudong

The fire in Nanshi gradually died down yesterday morning, but the fires on Zhaojiabang Road, Caiyi Street, and Xieqiao Bureau Gate Road inside Dadongmen continued to burn fiercely. Areas along the Bund, Dongmen Road, Jishui Street, etc., have been burned to the ground, with only black smoke visible. The Fortune Department Store was completely destroyed inside, with only the outer shell of the building still standing at the entrance of Xiaodongmen. Furthermore, the southern half of the Chenghuang Temple area in the south of the South Railway Station, Lujiabang Road, Damatou, Waitan Road, and Sanpailou in the inner city, and the area along Zhonghua Road eastward from Xiaoximen, have mostly turned into scorched earth. The fire on Fangxie Road near Heping Road the night before was extinguished after the French Concession Fire Brigade dispatched vehicles to the scene. More than half of the houses were destroyed. The fire in Nanshi was most intense in the previous two days. The flames observed by reporters from high buildings reached as many as 19 places. Therefore, the losses in Nanshi are no less than those in Zhabei and Hongkou.

Furthermore, it was reported that the raging flames in Nanshi had subsided by yesterday morning, but at around 1:00 PM, another major fire broke out in the Penglai Market area near Ximen. The smoke filled the sky for a time and gradually subsided by the evening.

In Pudong, two fires broke out successively yesterday morning at the southern end of Diandang Lane and Huayuan Stone Bridge. Due to the light rain, the flames were not as fierce as the day before. After two or three hours, only thirty or forty houses were destroyed before the fire gradually died down. In the afternoon, the rain became heavier, and there were no more flames in various places. Furthermore, it was found that Laiyidu Street suffered a terrible calamity the day before and was completely burned down. In the evening, the fire spread wildly to the streets on the east and west sides of the main street. Over a hundred houses were burned down on both the north and central sections of the ferry crossing road (commonly known as Old Street) on the west side of the street. On the east side of the main street, the fire spread along the police station road through the Four Pavilions to the intersection of Haixing Road and a noodle shop. In total, over a hundred shops and over three hundred civilian houses were destroyed in one day and night.

According to Mr. Zhu, who fled from Pudong to Shanghai yesterday morning (the 16th), after the enemy troops occupied Pudong, fires broke out in the large and small towns one after another and have not yet been extinguished. In recent days, towns of all sizes such as Lujiazai, Yangjiadu North, Caitangqiao, and Zhangjiazai have been almost completely burned down. Among them, Zhangjiazai was the most severely damaged, with over a hundred houses in the entire town reduced to scorched earth. Local ruffians have now turned into traitors, wearing white cloths on their arms, and are very active, searching and looting houses.

Current Commentary

### Common Attitude

– Appropriate

After the Brussels conference passed a resolution condemning Japan, the powers participating in the conference had to consider what "common attitude" they should take to deal with Japan's slamming of the door to negotiations. This so-called "common attitude" still seems to be a mystery, but after the moral condemnation, the resulting common attitude should have some practical strength for Japan.

In order to make this common attitude more positive, our delegation recently published a document encouraging the implementation of economic sanctions. If the powers can achieve a certain degree of economic sanctions, it can have a significant effect, and we can be very satisfied.

Of course, in today's very tense war situation, we cannot help but feel that slow economic sanctions are not enough to save our country's crisis. But by seeing the general trend of the world clearly, we can know that the international forces of peace have formed a strong front. The reason why some major powers are still procrastinating and prevaricating towards the forces of aggression is simply because they are afraid that being too hasty will cause the catastrophe of a world war. However, their attitude is ultimately becoming more and more active because of our country's resistance. As long as we continue to resist with a fearless and indomitable spirit, the peace front can exert great power.

### Municipal Council Official Discusses Food Situation in Shanghai

Not as Serious as Idealized; Expected Improvement in a Few Weeks

The North-China Daily News reported that a Municipal Council official told a reporter from the North-China Daily News yesterday that the food problem in this city could be alleviated after the cessation of hostilities in Shanghai, and the true shortage of various foods, or the price increase caused by merchants profiting, could be reduced to its original state. The shipping lines to Shanghai are gradually recovering, and vegetables and meats are expected to be transported from various places near Shanghai to meet the needs and reduce prices. Although there is an obvious shortage of food at present, it is said that it is not serious and not as idealized by the general public.

The source of vegetables in the Pudong and Huxi areas has been cut off, and this was felt on Sunday, but the situation improved greatly yesterday. The Japanese authorities occupying these two areas allowed farmers to transport vegetables into the settlements, but after entering the settlements, they were not allowed to return to the Huxi and Pudong areas. The Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities are currently negotiating to resolve this difficulty.

During the hostilities, fresh vegetables were transported into Shanghai as usual, but the quantity was slightly reduced. Although the sources and supply near Shanghai were cut off due to the war, vegetables were still available from other sources. In the past three weeks, farmers have transported a large number of vegetables. When the war was moving to the Hongqiao area, a large amount of storage was already available and could still be supplied. In normal times, cattle, sheep, and pigs are transported from Songjiang, Minhang, Kunshan, Pudong, and Jiangsu, but due to the war, the sources of these routes have been reduced. Most of the meat used to be transported from Minhang and Hongqiao, and vegetables were obtained from Dachang, Jiangwan, Liuhe, Luodian, Jiading, Fanwangdu, and other places. Later, these places became the front line of the war, so most of the vegetables were transported from Pudong and other Huxi areas. Fruits are transported from Yantai, Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Ningbo. During the hostilities, there was no lack of fruits. Coastal ships transported a large amount of fruit as usual. The current situation of fruit supply is more improved than in September.

A large amount of fresh fish and some fresh meat are still stored in the cold storage in the Hongkou area. Because there is enough fresh fish in the two settlements at present, there is no need to transport out this inventory. There is a lot of canned food in stock, and it has been fully imported as usual during the war.

In the past three months, merchants have profited from this, and the Municipal Council authorities have been unable to intervene. Due to the lack of sources, various prices have risen several times. However, in the most recent number of weeks, generally speaking, a great improvement is expected.

### French Concession Authorities Strictly Prohibit Rice Merchants from Hoarding and Profiteering

The French Concession authorities, in view of the fact that rice merchants in the concession are taking advantage of the unrest to disregard social stability, hoard food, and do everything possible to manipulate prices, have adopted strict measures to punish these traitors. At present, it is hoped that citizens within the concession, if they learn that any food rice shops are secretly hoarding rice, will quickly and secretly report the storage location to the political office of the French General Police Station in Lujiawan. If it is confirmed that the information is accurate, in addition to confiscating all the hoarded rice, the business license of the rice shop will be revoked, and the owner will be deported. The names of the informants will be kept confidential.

### Meat Prices Soar Due to Supply Shortages

Cattle and Sheep Businesses Requested to Procure from Northern Jiangsu; Pork, Vegetables, etc. Continue to Show Rising Trend

The prices of various foods in Shanghai have become surprisingly high. Pork has soared to around 1.3 taels per yuan per catty. According to people in the pork industry, after the war, pork prices in the Jiangbei and Huaiyang areas of northern Jiangsu have been steadily declining. Currently, one yuan can buy as much as ten catties. However, due to transportation obstructions and a disconnect in production and sales, both farmers and consumers are suffering significant losses. Earlier this month, the industry sent representatives to Jiangbei to purchase large quantities of pork, but due to a lack of ships on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line and overcrowding of passengers and cargo, few people were able to transport the goods. Now, foreign companies have added several ships to operate on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line, and large quantities of pigs can be transported here continuously. At that time, the selling price is expected to fall back.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on a presentation from the Cattle and Sheep Industry Association, stated that the Jiangsu Provincial Government originally designated Wujin, Danyang, and Wuxian as locations for purchasing cattle to be brought to Shanghai. Due to military reasons, transportation to these three locations has now been cut off. To maintain the meat supply in Shanghai, a special request has been made to change the procurement locations to six counties in northern Jiangsu, such as Rugao and Dongtai. The association has submitted the request to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval.

The supply of food in Shanghai is particularly difficult. According to the reporter's inspection of various vegetable markets yesterday morning, the supply of goods still felt lacking. As a result, pork prices continued to rise today. One yuan of national currency can only buy 1.8 catties. Cabbage sells for 13 cents per catty. In previous winters, it only sold for 3 or 4 cents. The price increase can be described as drastic. Other celery, spinach, cabbage, etc., each catty's selling price also is all about 10 cents, as high as the fish price at normal times. However, local product businesses are now making every effort to find ways to adjust supply sources, so the above price increase should be able to be suppressed. Otherwise, the livelihood of middle and lower-class families will feel extremely strained.

### Continued Unremitting Purchase of National Salvation Bonds

Intensifying Solicitation; Contributing to National Use

Since the government advocated for the solicitation of National Salvation Bonds, all sectors of the city have enthusiastically donated and purchased them, accumulating a large amount to contribute to the country. Now, although the war has been extended by three months, it is still in the first stage, and the need for funds remains extremely urgent. Therefore, all sectors continue to unremittingly exhaust their financial resources and purchase bonds in installments. The recent bond solicitation achievements of various groups, etc., are summarized below:

Tailoring Industry Raised Over 30,000 Yuan

The member stores of the Shanghai Tailoring Trade Association, although being manual industries, have always been at the forefront of patriotic movements. When the clouds of war spread to Shanghai, the association immediately engaged in soliciting national salvation donations and donating cotton clothing to wounded soldiers. It has recently been reported that the association is working hard to solicit national bonds. The results obtained are as follows:

Wuxi Compatriots Raised 10,000 Yuan

The Wuxi Compatriot Association, since the establishment of a National Salvation Bond Compatriot Group branch, with Director Liu Chunpu and Supervisors Kuang Zhongmou and Wang Yaochen in charge of soliciting donations from compatriots in Shanghai, has already raised more than 10,000 yuan. Due to the tense work in recent days, the order in the Qipu Road and Aierjin Road area has also returned to normal. It will move back to its original location for office work in the coming days to actively promote bond matters. It is heard that the originally planned solicitation amount was 20,000 yuan. Based on the achievements of the previous month, it should be able to be raised in a short period.

Gentry and Wealthy Discuss Intensifying Solicitation

The gentry and wealthy group of the National Salvation Bond Citizen Solicitation Team held a meeting yesterday to discuss ways to continue intensifying solicitation. After the chairman reported on the solicitation achievements, it was resolved that the chief and deputy captains would entrust people familiar with the gentry and wealthy to separately request them to continue purchasing more bonds. Those who have already subscribed and are paying in installments are requested to clear the payments in advance.

Generosity of Hua'e Fang Landlords

Hua'e Fang landlord Zheng Chongrui, after generously offering all outstanding rent and subsequent monthly rent until the end of the Shanghai war and the resumption of transportation, to purchase National Salvation Bonds, the tenants also cooperated sincerely. It is known that the outstanding rent portion has been scheduled to be paid in three installments. Yesterday, each tenant collected cash on behalf of the landlord to purchase bonds, including Taixing Da Tong 1,540 yuan, Xiandai 454 yuan, Rixin 483 yuan, Yongan 554 yuan, Meili and Shanghai 431.25 yuan, Shuntai 386 yuan, Yishu 304.5 yuan, Meizuishi 504 yuan, Beiyang 78.75 yuan, Nanjing 90 yuan, Minsheng 49 yuan, Hao Meimei 89.25 yuan, and Huaan 36.25 yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan.

New rent purchases of bonds will also be implemented according to established methods.

### First Batch of Imported Rice Ordered by the Municipal Council to Arrive in Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow

115,000 Bags Can Be Shipped Within the Month; Agreement on Releasing Rice Boats from Nanshi Has Not Yet Been Agreed Upon

Although various rice and grain organizations in Shanghai have made every effort to dredge the source and adjust prices to ensure the civilian food supply, the situation is still quite tricky due to the tense situation and transportation obstructions. Though the concession authorities have negotiated for the release of rice boats berthed in Nanshi, the true specific implementation methods have not yet been agreed upon. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession will take the 20,000 bags of stored rice to be sold at fair price to retail rice shops to maintain the people's grain supply. Overall demand exceeds supply in the marketplace and is not enough to distribute. Many rice shops are forced to temporarily suspend operations. Now, the Municipal Council has ordered imported foreign rice. The first batch of 25,000 bags will arrive on the 19th, and the second batch of 30,000 bags will arrive on the 21st. It is expected that 115,000 bags can be transported before the 25th of this month. Although rice may feel scarce within these few days, there are sufficient reserves of flour and imported foreign rice is arriving soon in Shanghai, so Shanghai's food supply may still be safe.

### New General Manager of Haitong News Agency

According to a local report from the Haitong News Agency, Fu Houthus, the Far East General Manager of the German Haitong News Agency, was recalled to Germany in March of this year. Since then, the agency's affairs have been temporarily handled by the editor-in-chief of the agency's English department, Meizuishi. It is now known that the Berlin headquarters has formally appointed Mr. Mei as the General Manager of the Far East General Agency due to Mr. Mei's outstanding achievements. The agency has six branches under its jurisdiction: Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beiping, and Manila. According to reports, Mr. Mei was born in Tianjin, China in 1908. He returned to Germany for education at a young age and entered Baimen University. After completing his studies, he went to the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, the Netherlands, and South Africa for business. In 1929, he returned to China and first went to Fuzhou, then to Shanghai, to take over the position of chief editor of the Haitong News Agency. During the Shanghai War of 1932, Mr. Mei also served in the International Volunteer Corps and was wounded in the left arm by a Japanese bullet. Mr. Mei is extremely capable. He is currently 30 years old and has been in China for a total of 18 years.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announces the Process of Moving Commercial Goods from Zhabei

### Ningbo River Blockaded, Traffic Not Interrupted, Shanghai-Ningbo Line Will Continue to Sail

The Ender Ship Arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo This Afternoon; The De Ping Ship May Depart Today; Shanghai-Tongzhou Line Operates as Usual

The De Ping of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company may return to Shanghai from Ningbo today, being the last ship from Ningbo to Shanghai. After the ship enters the port today, it will stop going to Ningbo. The Zhenhai port is not completely blockaded. However, to deal with the tense situation, the fortress headquarters has banned ships from entering and exiting, and is prepared to block the navigable waterways if necessary to fortify the coastal defense. The news that Zhenhai has experienced war, as reported in Shanghai, has been inquired by a certain local company and is completely inaccurate. (However, according to the Central News Agency's telegram, enemy ships bombarded Zhenhai with artillery.) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ender ship has decided to change its route to Shanghai-Tongzhou starting on Thursday, while the De Ping ship intends to sail from Shanghai to Zhoushan to transport refugees away from Shanghai.

Currently, Shanghai's transportation relies entirely on foreign merchant ships traveling to and from various sea routes, such as Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Min, Wenzhou, Shantou, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Tianjin, and other ports. There are about eight ships traveling each week. However, due to the war situation in Xiamen, the number of cargo and passengers going to and from has greatly decreased. Therefore, there are fewer ships traveling there, about only once a week. In the past three months, the Japanese navy has not openly made things difficult or inspected third-country ships entering and exiting Wusong. It is reported that recently, when foreign merchant ships were sailing to Tongzhou, Japanese warships inspected passengers outside Wusongkou. After this news spread, passengers were quite anxious. Inquiries to various shipping companies are met with claims that they are still awaiting verification. As for foreign ships, the Havel of the North German Company has arrived in Shanghai and is docked at the Guanghua Oil Company pier. It started loading cargo to Europe yesterday. Shenshi Agency reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route's De Ping ship, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 15th, temporarily announced a cancellation due to receiving a telegram from Ningbo requesting not to sail there for the time being. This sudden cancellation caused the outside world to misunderstand that a war had broken out in the Ningbo area again, and all parties were very concerned about it. According to the Shenshi Agency reporter's inquiry with the company, it was learned that the reason for the De Ping ship's suspension was not the outbreak of war in Ningbo, but the blockade of the Yongjiang River. When our authorities blockaded the river a few days ago, they had left a channel that could only accommodate one ship to enter and exit. However, yesterday they completely blockaded the channel again, causing the Ender ship, which had sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo a few days ago and was originally scheduled to sail from Ningbo to Shanghai on the 15th, to be unable to sail out and was suspended. Now, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, etc., after the requests of various compatriots, has made many efforts to continue operating the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Therefore, the De Ping ship may depart from Shanghai this afternoon, but it must not sail into the Yongjiang River. It can only sail to Zhoushan for disembarkation, and then transfer to Ningbo. As for the Ender ship, a telegram has been sent to Shanghai stating that it has sailed from Ningbo at 11:00 AM today and is expected to arrive at this port at noon on the 17th, and will continue sailing. The Shanghai-Tongzhou route is still operating as usual. The ships traveling on this route are the British Taikoo Company's Wuhu, Wuxue, and Jardine Matheson Company's Pinghe. The Wuhu ship sailed from Shanghai to Tongzhou on the morning of the 15th, the Pinghe ship sailed yesterday morning, and the Wuxue ship is scheduled to sail to Tongzhou this morning. In recent days, many merchants and passengers from various places have taken the above three ships from Shanghai to Tongzhou and then transferred to Zhenjiang, and then traveled to various parts of the interior. Therefore, the passenger transportation on this route is very developed.

### West Union Association of Shanghai Relieves Street Refugees

Exposed to the Elements, Hungry and Cold; All Sectors Compete to Donate Food and Cash

The West Union Beneficiary Society of Shanghai has been relieving refugees in southern Shanghai for several days, distributing no less than tens of thousands of pieces of food and clothing. Considering the fact that in recent days, refugees who are homeless and wandering on the roads and lanes are exposed to the elements, filling the streets. Most of them are hungry, cold, and in a miserable state. Not only do they have nowhere to be accommodated, but also food supply has been cut off, they have no way to appeal, and their situation is even worse than in the refugee camps. Therefore, the association immediately dispatched a large number of food and clothing by car along the French Concession to distribute and assist the vagrant refugees gathered on the streets. It also hopes that all sectors will enthusiastically donate food to ensure universal distribution and immeasurable merit. The association's telephone number is 35627, and notice can be given to all sectors, and people will be sent to collect donations. The association received the following items donated by all sectors yesterday: 5,000 flatbreads from Lu Deyu, 2,000 flatbreads from Da You Bao Zhuang, 1,700 flatbreads from Xin Yu No. 2 Factory, 1,400 flatbreads from an anonymous donor, 1,000 flatbreads each from Rong Chunxiang Hongbinzhai, 2,800 buns from Pan Baokang, 1,300 pairs of socks from a sock factory, 1,210 socks from Cui Jun, and over 30,000 other items of clothing and food donated by all sectors. The staff of Zhengwei Pharmacy donated 50 yuan, designated to purchase food, and Tianlu Confectionery donated five large baskets of food, all entrusted to the association to be transferred to various districts for distribution to refugees.

### Refugee Camps Need Rice and Bedding

Hoping Enthusiastic Men and Women Will Donate

According to news from the Red Swastika Society yesterday, the food in the Nanshi refugee camp has recently been secured. Flatbreads and large flatbreads are enough for five days, but this type of flatbread is not easily digestible if eaten in large quantities. It has now been decided to change to eating rice porridge, supplemented with flatbreads. Therefore, the most needed items are rice, wheat, salt, firewood, charcoal, and cotton bedding. It is hoped that enthusiastic men and women from all walks of life will do their best to donate, with immeasurable merit.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Postponement of Bond Delivery

If Related Parties Have No Objections, It Should Be Approved; Interest Calculation Scheme for Postponement Approved Together

The Chinese Securities Exchange Brokers Association of this city notified all brokers in their association yesterday of a matter regarding bond delivery delays, stating that they had received Order No. 1466 from the Ministry of Finance, stating that all details of their petition were known, and the proposed postponement method was investigated. In the event that related parties do not have any objections, it should be approved. All interest during the extension is to be calculated in accordance with the proposed plan. Subordinates are to comply and report for verification, with this order saved. Interest calculation plan for the extension:

1. From August to September, the swap period was used at a monthly interest rate of 1% (only handling fees were charged for September).

2. From the end of September to the end of January of the 27th year, the extension was at a monthly interest rate of 7.5% (average monthly interest rate of 8%).

3. The interest coupons that should be collected on January 31 of the 27th year will be collected by the seller to offset the swap and extension interest. If there are any minor discrepancies, they should be paid in cash at the time of settlement.

4. If the situation permits and settlement can be made before February 1, the extension interest will be calculated uniformly at a monthly interest rate of 1%.

5. For the repayment of the 8% bonds from August to January, interest will be subsidized monthly at 10 cents (paid in cash at the time of settlement).

### Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf Ferry Operates as Usual

After the fall of Pudong, the ferries in the Huangpu River feared being seized and fled one after another. The sampan boats also docked near the Jianghai Customs and were unwilling to travel to Pudong. Therefore, the cross-river transportation between Shanghai and Pudong is now only served by the Blue Funnel Wharf ferry, which operates as usual, carrying passengers back and forth. The schedule is as follows: departing from the Blue Funnel Wharf at 8:30 AM, 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 2:30 PM, and 4:30 PM; departing from the Shanghai Jianghai Customs Wharf at 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 3:00 PM, and 5:00 PM, for a total of ten round trips.

### Cilian Association Introduces Workers from Textile Factories

The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association previously received a letter from the West Union Beneficiary Society of Shanghai to investigate and organize the registration of textile factory workers. Now, the Yongning and other thirteen shelters have completed the investigation one after another. Over two hundred workers were obtained. Yesterday, the association notified the shelters to send the workers to the West Union Beneficiary Society of Shanghai to be assigned to various factories for employment. It is heard that the association is still continuing to investigate and register these workers, so that unemployed refugees can all obtain appropriate work.

### British Consulate General in Shanghai Reopens Main Entrance

The British Consulate General in Shanghai moved to the Hamilton Building to work after the Shanghai war. It then moved back to its original site on the Bund, but because it was close to the war zone, it switched to using the back entrance on Yuanmingyuan Road. It has been two months since. Now, because the war has spread outwards, the consulate resumed using the main entrance on the Bund yesterday. Two armed British soldiers were dispatched by the British defense forces to guard the entrance, and everything has returned to normal.

### Pushan Cemetery Buried Over 20,000 Bodies

Since the outbreak of the war, the Pushan Cemetery in this city has spared no effort in carrying out the work of burying soldiers and refugees in the war zone. According to Chen Liangyu, the standing committee member of the association, the association has buried more than 20,800 bodies as of recently. Among them, there are more than 18,000 refugees, all of whom were brutally killed by enemy aircraft.

### Norwegian Cod Liver Oil Relieves Chinese Refugee Children

It was reported a few days ago that the manufacturer of Norwegian cod liver oil donated 5,500 pounds of the oil to relieve Chinese refugee children in Shanghai. This was presided over by the Norwegian Consulate and the authorities handling relief affairs. What I have heard is recorded below, which I believe will be welcomed by people who run children's hospitals and childcare organizations. It is said that Norway is famous for producing cod, and the cod liver oil produced is supervised by the government. The scientific community has long recognized cod liver oil as a supplement rich in vitamins. In all cases where children are physically weak and mentally depressed, taking cod liver oil will have a positive effect. Due to this war disaster, many refugee children die due to lack of nutrition. Doctors generally believe that refugee children lack the vitamins contained in cod liver oil. In view of this, the Norwegian cod liver oil manufacturer specially telegraphed the Norwegian Consul in Shanghai, willing to donate 5,500 pounds of oil to be distributed to childcare organizations for assistance and relief. It is heard that many hospitals have requested donations from the Consul. In the future, all requests must provide detailed information about the hospital that needs Norwegian cod liver oil, such as the names of the directors, the number of refugee children, the number of beds, and the number of Western doctors. Once the oil arrives in China, the organizers can consider distributing it.

### Proving the Truth, the Crime Deserves to be Punished for Deduction of Refugee Food

Li Rensheng, Director of Xinheng Shelter, Embezzled Refugee Rice and Sold It for Profit

Li Rensheng, the Ningbo director of the Xinheng shelter, deducted refugee rations, obtaining fifty piculs of white rice. Later, he sold it to the Sanmao Rice Store at 354 Shanhai Pass Road for a price of 669 yuan. After being informed by a whistleblower, Huatan Captain Zhang Mingde and investigator Huang Fusen of the General Patrol House arrested him and handed him over to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The case was retried by Judge Meng Tingke a few days ago. The lawyers of the patrol house, Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian, prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 339, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. The representative of the Sanmao Rice Store testified about Li's sale of rice. The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association (the main body of Xinheng Shelter) also sent Yu Xiangqin as a representative to the court, requesting that he be prosecuted according to law. Although all parties have presented evidence, Li Rensheng still resolutely denied everything. After questioning by Judge Meng, it was deemed that further investigation was necessary, so he ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Chinese Police Kills Three Supervisors Out of Hatred

A Stray Bullet Endangers Another Three Supervisors

Chinese Police No. 2423 of the Public Concession Police Department was assigned to work at the Huishan Police Station. After the area of the police station became a war zone, the police officer was reassigned to the Laozha Police Station. Recently, the police officer had been repeatedly investigated by Chinese police officer No. 1676 for negligence in the performance of his duties, and reported to his superiors for punishment, which caused police officer No. 2423 to harbor resentment. At 7:00 AM yesterday, when the police officers were reporting for duty, No. 2423 suddenly loaded a bullet into his issued pistol and fired five shots at supervisor No. 1676, all hitting him, causing serious injuries. Supervisor No. 160, who was nearby, was also hit by a stray bullet, but fortunately, it did not hit a vital part and was not life-threatening. Police officer No. 2423 was arrested by the Chinese and Western staff of the police station and detained, pending delivery to the Special First Court for interrogation this morning. It is reported that supervisor No. 1676 was seriously injured and died.

### Robbery of Audit Office Public Funds Case, Gang of Bandits Arrested

Robbery of Over 10,000 Yuan in National Currency; French Police Department Seizes Both People and Stolen Goods

On the sixth of last month, Lin Jinyu, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance, received 11,400 yuan in public funds, intending to distribute it to his subordinates. Unexpectedly, six robbers armed with weapons broke in, prohibiting any protests, and robbed all of the public funds and fled. Lin reported to the French Patrol House. The case has only just been solved by Inspectors Jiang Futian and Li Xiancun, Investigators Zhou Bingcheng, Zhang Daorong, Shen Jinshu, Yao Zhupo, and Detective Bu Zhenglong, Tao Ronglin, and Dai Rongji of the French Police Department, who learned that the robbers were hiding in Room 17 of the Jiahe Hotel on Fujian Road in the Public Concession. They immediately rushed to the address and arrested the robbers Wang Ziming (29 years old, Shaoxing native), Tan Jinfa (38 years old, Anhui native), Lu Arui (33 years old, Suzhou native), Wu Yongfu (34 years old, Nanjing native), Chen Yilin (24 years old, Nanjing native), Hua Weifeng (37 years old, Ningbo native), Tan Yunxiang (35 years old, Anhui native), and Lu Caisheng (33 years old, Pudong native), eight in total. A portion of the stolen money was found and taken back to the police station. They were handed over to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying visited the first criminal court for continued trial. The police department's lawyer stated that the investigation of this case was not yet concluded, and further arrests of accomplices were required. The court was requested to extend the term. After reviewing the report, the court briefly interrogated the defendants, approved the extension to the morning of the 23rd for retrial, and the defendants remained in custody.

### Consoling Returning Overseas Chinese

— Wu Tiren

(Editor's Note) This time, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received approval from the Executive Yuan to allocate funds for chartering ships to bring back overseas Chinese from Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Apart from those who have already safely returned to their hometowns, there are still over ten thousand awaiting repatriation. Mr. Wu Tiren was assigned to Xiamen to oversee consolation and care matters, and it is expected he will be finished around the end of the month. This article is his recent work and is published here for your information.

Our only task in handling overseas Chinese affairs is to encourage our citizens to develop abroad. Whether it's the business and economy, culture and education, social undertakings, or legal treatment of overseas Chinese, we should not only design to consolidate their existing status and strive to maintain the status quo but also further seek ways to expand their scale, enrich their inner beauty, reduce restrictions, and promote their brilliance. Therefore, in addition to encouraging virtuous overseas Chinese to return home for sightseeing, frequently entering and leaving the country, and bridging gaps to achieve the effect of connecting those within and outside the country, we should offer them our utmost respect and comfort. However, if they voluntarily or involuntarily abandon their businesses and return, that is something we find very unpleasant. But this time, the overseas Chinese from Japan, Taiwan, and Korea are not only abandoning their businesses but doing so in groups. It's not just thousands upon thousands of unemployed but also the homeless, uneducated, sick, and elderly, with tears in their eyes, sighing to each other. It is more than enough to cause us immense displeasure; what more is there to say?

However, on second thought, under circumstances where restrictions were imposed, situations were turbulent, and amidst stormy seas and violent storms, they were able to "sail smoothly" and "celebrate a safe passage." After the pain subsided, I felt secretly comforted and infinitely fortunate. Therefore, when I, Tiren, was comforting and observing the overseas Chinese in the reception center, and when I was meeting with them in public and private venues, I felt a mix of bitterness and optimistic joy stirring and intermingling in my mind. It was a unique experience. My sincere feelings and intentions were not fully expressed, and my words were not comprehensive. Let me just mention one brief point and respectfully present it again to my beloved overseas Chinese compatriots.

Premier Sun praised our overseas Chinese as the "mother of the revolution" and said, "The revolution has not yet succeeded." Now, the second phase of the National Revolution is just beginning to progress. As the "mother," needless to say, they have not yet reached the point of enjoying the comfort of "repayment" and should still exhaust their efforts in "taking care of" and nurturing this fledgling until it becomes independent and successful. Our overseas Chinese, residing overseas, have the deepest and most profound feeling of the stimulation of "weak countries have no human rights," so they are also the most patriotic and concerned about the country. The fields that others till, the thorns that others cut through, the rulers who call themselves superior nations, those things that they deem unworthy, our overseas Chinese are happy to do. The laziness and mediocrity of the ruled class, those things that they cannot do, our overseas Chinese excel at doing. The spirit of creation, the ability to build, and the virtues of hard work, diligence, and independence, only our overseas Chinese "know through hardship" and "nurture with care." From now on, we should continue to base ourselves on this spirit and ability. After returning to our respective hometowns and "resting briefly from labor," we should inherit the government's wartime production plans and, according to our special circumstances regarding personnel, resources, geography, and timing, make the greatest effort to move forward. We should be as quick and responsive as Germany was during the European War, producing ten million bags of wheat flour and collecting one million dan of cotton clothing within twenty-four hours to supply the front lines. Tiren deeply believes in the scientific law of "conservation of energy," that all energy can only be transferred, combined, separated, and hidden, but will not be destroyed. Therefore, I deeply believe that our returned overseas Chinese will be able to use the remaining courage and experience they gained from their overseas ventures to provide a rich reserve of vitamins to nourish the life of the nation and add a new force to the people's mobilization team. This is one point. Among the national disasters, the suffering of the overseas Chinese is the most severe. I hope that you will take the experience of being suppressed and wounded, as well as the unfortunate facts that you have heard and seen and that are credibly documented, and all the painful history imprinted in your hearts, back to your hometowns to "testify in person." Tell it all, one by one. This kind of living teaching material is more powerful than any popular reading material. Then, through neighbors, relatives, and friends, spread it far and wide, penetrating all levels and deeply into civil society. It will be more effective than thousands upon thousands of national crisis textbooks. In today's urgent need for public training and propaganda work, you are providing such practical and novel materials that are hard to come by, which will naturally foster a common psychology of deeper hatred for the enemy and stronger faith, strengthen the intense awareness of national resistance, and, by extension, make organization stricter and steps more orderly. On the front line of total resistance, a solid foundation will be laid, relying on you to shoulder hoes and carry baskets to go together. This is another point.

In short, the ancient Confucian and Mohist schools had supreme teachings such as "being vigilant according to the times" and "no blame in difficulty and danger." We, who live in times of hardship and national crisis, should chew on and temper ourselves with them the most. This time, the returning overseas Chinese have suffered the most in terms of "suffering their minds, laboring their muscles and bones, and starving their bodies..." Therefore, the great responsibility entrusted to them is especially heavy. Those who can shoulder the responsibility of contributing effort, money, and words all in one person, none are better than our returned overseas Chinese.

Oh, there is something more to say. The chairman and vice-chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, as well as the standing committee members, have either traveled overseas to comfort and solicit donations or formed the Overseas Chinese Goods Relief Association. In addition to collecting the material and financial resources of the overseas Chinese, they have also worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant departments to divide the work and achieve success, comprehensively planning effective ways to relieve the distressed overseas Chinese, and jointly submitting proposals to the Executive Yuan for approval to allocate huge sums of money for repatriation and chartering ships. Amidst frequent air raid alarms, they have been working diligently and carefully, for the country and for the overseas Chinese, planning and considering both. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has remitted huge sums of money for relief. The governments of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other coastal provinces and cities have also allocated funds and prepared vehicles to work together. Reporters and journalists, and civil society organizations have also been able to cooperate and divide the work with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, wholeheartedly thinking and working for our returned overseas Chinese. It can be said that between the central and local governments, between the government and the people, and between organizations, a state of supreme virtue has been achieved, where everyone is united in spirit and shares the same heart, which is truly a landmark achievement in the history of the nation. The great task of rejuvenation will surely be achieved with optimism. Mr. Gao Shaolai, the mayor of Xiamen, said it well. When the World Games were held in Berlin last year, I heard Hitler say, "I hope that people from all countries who come here to visit will be filled with joy and return to their own countries." I also hope that the returned overseas Chinese who pass through Xiamen will "have no regrets when they return." In that case, since our returned overseas Chinese have been so sincerely treated by all parties through collective efforts, how should they embody and practice this spirit of sincerity, unity, joy, and harmony, expand and enrich it, and apply it to various undertakings to repay the Party and the country in a way that is commensurate? As for Tiren's mission to Xiamen, I had already made up my mind when I left Beijing. I deeply believe that the duty of this trip lies in comforting and caring for the distressed overseas Chinese in particular. Therefore, I will not refuse danger and will not be swayed by doubts. The sub-par living conditions during the journey are also insignificant and I will gladly accept them. All this may not be enough to comfort our returned overseas Chinese, but perhaps it is enough to serve as a source of mutual encouragement.

### Impressions of Mayor Yu

— Cheng Xu

From the start of the "August 13th" Shanghai battle to the complete fall of Shanghai, the timeframe was exactly three full months. In the short process of the ninety-day Shanghai battle, it became very clear to us the great significance of national rejuvenation.

In military terms, the loyalty, courage, and self-sacrificing spirit of the soldiers at the front are truly worthy of praise, tears, respect, and love. As for the group of administrative officials who bore the important responsibility of the rear in Shanghai, in this period of total resistance, we really have no time to review them. But there is one among them that cannot be ignored. Who is he? He is Yu Hongjun, the mayor of Shanghai, who took office in a time of crisis.

My usual job as a reporter at the newspaper focuses on social news, so I rarely have the opportunity to get close to the administrative officials of Shanghai. Among the past mayors of Shanghai, I have seen Mayor Wu Tiecheng twice. I remember the first time was at the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road, where he was watching a movie. The second time was at the opening of a large company, where he was cutting the ribbon at the grand ceremony. As for Mayor Yu Hongjun, I only knew that before he was acting mayor, he was the secretary-general of the municipal government. I had sometimes heard the people praise him, but as a reporter, I did not have a deep impression.

Once the war started, war news became essential, and social news was temporarily outdated. A building on × Bund ××× Road became the source of war news, forming a daily gathering place for reporters, which was praised by both Chinese and foreign journalists as the Press Conference. As a reporter, I adapted to the times and managed to occupy one of the spots. Although the news I got every day was hard to make people excited, and the mechanical work was a bit boring, it still felt more valuable than closing the door and building a car that could not follow the tracks.

One morning, when I first went to that source of war news, many of my colleagues also arrived one after another, talking loudly and animatedly. As the clock struck eleven, a middle-aged man of about forty, wearing a suit, hurriedly arrived and stood in the corridor in front of a detailed map of Shanghai. At this time, many reporters gathered around, and the middle-aged man pointed to the map and explained the progress of the war on that day. That kind of frankness and sincerity, without any official airs, and especially the civilian attitude, made me guess that he was at most a member of the municipal government.

However, this person was Mayor Yu, which surprised me!

Logically speaking, in this extraordinary period of military turmoil and busy government affairs, given his position as the head of a city, he could have entrusted such trivial matters as conveying war news to news reporters to his subordinates. But he did not shy away from the trouble of personally coming forward and explaining in detail. From this alone, it can be seen that he usually handles matters himself and does not easily delegate them to others, which has cultivated his great spirit of courage to take responsibility. If the government appointed more such administrative officials, the people would definitely not feel disgusted.

During the ninety days of the war, the war news source was scheduled to receive Chinese and foreign reporters once every Saturday afternoon at six o'clock. On one occasion, I also had the honor of attending. At that time, blue-eyed and yellow-bearded people, both fat and thin, gathered together. Mr. Yu personally reported, using his very fluent English, and described the latest war situation in detail without any concealment. But what he said was not words like "defeating the enemy" or "annihilating so many enemies." He frankly stated that the enemy had advanced to the line of Gejia Pailou and Huanggang, only 500 meters away from Dachang. At that time, the general foreign reporters expressed a kind of sympathetic sigh for the dramatic changes in the war, but they expressed a kind of enthusiastic admiration for Yu's sincere report. At the same time, Mr. Yu gave me an even better impression, that is, he did not overly regard the foreign reporters and neglect the domestic reporters. After he interacted with the foreign reporters, he also approached the domestic reporters and was very enthusiastic for a long time.

In these memories, I think Mr. Yu is indeed a good official. However, it is regrettable that Mr. Yu could not be appointed before the "January 28th" Shanghai battle, and only took office in the serious national crisis of "August 13th," so that he could not fully demonstrate his strengths!

The sound of gunfire is far away, and Shanghai is as quiet as a dead city. In the dim midnight of autumn rain, our work is as busy as before. Occasionally, I think back to the source of war news, and at the same time, Mayor Yu's earnest face appears in my mind. I have infinite feelings!

I think the wise Mayor Yu will not feel disappointed at all. He will surely continue to work hard for the country with his past spirit.

### The Enemy Peeks into Suzhou Along the Sujia Road, Our Large Army Gathers to Strike a Fierce Blow

Our Senior Military Officers Personally Supervise the Battle at the Front Line - The New Front Line is Extremely Solid and the Morale is Extremely High

Since the enemy landed at Baimaokou, the enemies in Liuhe and Jiading have jointly invaded westward. For strategic reasons, our army has retreated from Kunshan and Qingyanggang to Zhengyi to establish close contact with the Jiaxing line and deploy a strong force to fight a desperate battle with the enemy. At the same time, some of the enemies who landed at Baimaokou crossed the Baimaokou River from Zhitang to peep into Changshu. According to relevant sources, a fierce battle took place outside the east gate of Changshu last night, with heavy losses on both sides. After being defeated by us at Qiliqiao Station in Jiaxing, the enemy who landed at Jinshanwei fled north to Wangjiangjing and Pingwang, peeking into Suzhou along the Sujia Road. Our army is blocking them. A large number of our troops are stationed on this line, and our senior officers are now personally commanding at the front line. The morale is also very high. On this new front line of more than one hundred kilometers, our soldiers will inflict heavy damage on the enemy.

Military News: Our military authorities are now shifting the Shanghai battle situation completely to the national defense line. Although the enemy is advancing step by step, our side has long been prepared for this line. The deployment of military force has been completed. A major battle will be launched today and tomorrow to fight to the death with the enemy. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy launched multiple attacks on Changshu, and fierce battles took place in the southeastern suburbs of the city. At the same time, many enemy warships gathered on the Fushan River, bombarding the Fushan defense area to cover the landing of the army, attempting to attack Changshu from the side. Our army is fighting hard to block them. From Changshu to Zhengyi, our army is along the Dahengjing and the highlands east of Yangcheng Lake, and the front line is very solid. From Zhengyi south to Pingwang, it forms a tripod with Suzhou and has close contact. Yesterday, some of the enemies in Pingwang fled north along the railway line, attempting to pressure Suzhou. They are being blocked by us at Shenghu Tangjia Lake and will not be difficult to annihilate. Yesterday, the enemy who invaded Jiaxing from the southeast of Jiashan advanced to the area of Qixingqiao and Shibaliliqiao, but were immediately attacked by our army and suffered heavy casualties. They did not dare to move forward. The line between Jiaxing, Pinghu, and Zhapu is very quiet except for the fighting near Pinghu.

### Our Army Holds the New Position on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 17th (Reuters): According to Chinese sources, after the Chinese army received reinforcements, it has consolidated the front-line positions of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The Chinese army is now holding a front line of about ninety miles, from Pukou on the Yangtze River to Zhapu, passing through Changshu, Zhengyi, Qingpu, Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places. It is reported that the deployment of the new front line has been completed.

### The Enemy Landing in Hangzhou Bay Advances in Three Routes, the Battle is Fierce

Hangzhou, Central News Agency, 16th: The enemy landing in Hangzhou Bay advanced along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to Jiaxing on the 16th, with the left wing attacking our Zhapu and Pinghu lines, and the right wing taking the Xitang Town and invading Pingwang. The battle situation on all three routes is fierce, and there has been no major change in our positions.

### More Than 3,000 Enemy Reinforcements Arrive Again

Central News Agency reported: At 6:00 this morning (17th), the ninth batch of the enemy's seventh reinforcements, more than 3,000 people, arrived in Shanghai on four enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships: No. 66 Asamaru, No. 170 Sohyomaru, No. 16 Hinodemaru, and No. 28 Singapore Maru. They docked at the Osaka, Huangpu, and Hongkou wharves respectively, disembarked, and were transported to the front by enemy-prepared military trucks.

At around 8:00 this morning, the enemy battleship Asahi, with a displacement of more than 14,000 tons, sailed into Shanghai and is now moored at buoy No. 8 in the Huangpu River.

### The Enemy Transports a Large Number of Small Motorboats

Central News Agency reported: This morning (17th), five enemy transport ships, No. 64 Taitaimaru, No. 146 Magasusamaru, No. 24 Bayangmaru, No. 204 Shokokumaru, and No. 162 Kayomaru, successively sailed into Shanghai, carrying more than 200 small motorboats and a large number of military supplies and food.

### The Active Situation of Traitors in Pudong

After the fires in Pudong were gradually extinguished, at 9:00 this morning, the folk houses on the back street of the Pudong Grand Theater, behind the Taikoo company's warehouse, were burned again. Because the houses were wet after yesterday's heavy rain, the flames were not very strong, and only ten or so houses were destroyed, but the fire is still spreading. Because the enemy army does not allow residents returning from Puxi to land to visit, a large number of people are stranded in a certain foreign warehouse today. A group of people secretly climbed over the wall and walked to the street, intending to go home to see if their houses had been burned down, but more than a dozen people were shot and killed, and the rest fled back to the warehouse. Two small workers were also injured. A small number of villagers colluded with traitors, paying two yuan per person to sell vegetables in Puxi. However, the escaping vegetable vendors said that the work done by the traitors was to lead the way and forcibly recruit laborers. They only worked for three hours a day, and then they were free to move around and arbitrarily loot movable items from the houses and carry them to a certain place along the Huangpu River for sale. The poor people who did not escape dared to be angry but dared not speak.

### More Than 500 Million Yuan in Losses from the Fire in Nanshi and Pudong

200,000 to 300,000 People Displaced

After Nanshi and Pudong were occupied, the houses, factories, institutions, schools, etc. were all set on fire, resulting in raging flames filling the sky and sparks flying in all directions. The fire lasted for four or five days, and almost all the buildings and people's property in the area were completely burned down. As a result, 200,000 to 300,000 people were displaced, and the situation was truly rare in the world. According to a survey, the total losses suffered by our Nanshi and Pudong in this unprecedented catastrophe amounted to more than 500 million yuan. Among them, the biggest losses were factories and wharf warehouses, followed by institutions and folk houses.

### The Insurance Industry Suggests a One-Corner-A-Day Movement

Formulating Four Measures, Deeply Hope That All Sectors Will Promote Them to Raise Funds for Long-Term Relief for Disaster Victims

The Shanghai Insurance Industry Wartime Service Corps suggested to the International Relief Committee this morning: "Dear Sirs, after our army withdrew from Nanshi, a large number of refugees were displaced, homeless, standing on the side of the Minguo Road, braving the rain and enduring hunger, begging for food, no different from a living hell. At the same time, there are still soldiers who retreated to the concessions, who are also imprisoned in various places in the concessions, or are injured in hospitals, and their suffering is even deeper than that of the refugees. All citizens in the concessions, witnessing this, are heartbroken and cannot help but feel the highest compassion of mankind, enthusiastically donating money and food to relieve the immediate crisis. However, facts have proved that this kind of temporary relief method, although it can help the refugees and soldiers a little, cannot be regarded as a planned and sustainable method. In view of this, our Corps has launched the "One-Corner-A-Day Movement" to provide supplies for refugees and soldiers, and has formulated the following measures: (1) Those with considerable income should save one jiao of legal tender per person per day. (2) Those who have a job but earn very little can jointly donate one jiao of legal tender per day for several people. (3) Housewives and children can also save one jiao of expenses per day (of course, the poor are excluded). (4) In addition to each doing their best to donate one jiao per person per day, the personnel of companies, institutions, or shops can save one jiao per table from the meal expenses. We deeply hope that all public organizations and newspapers will quickly adopt the above suggestions and make every effort to promote them in many ways, so that they can be popularized in various places, and call on the people of the whole country to donate for a long time and overcome the difficulties together."

### Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Local Goods and Coal Industries to Suppress Hoarding

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that vegetables and coal are essential for people's lives and should be used to clear sources and suppress hoarding. Yesterday, it sent separate letters to the Local Goods Industry Association and the Coal Industry Association to properly plan measures. The Chamber of Commerce will also strive to assist within its possible scope.

### Yangzhou Suffers Air Raid

[Yangzhou] At the end of the 15th, 15 enemy planes flew over the western suburbs and dropped ten bombs, killing one villager and injuring two (Special Dispatch on the 15th).

### A Glimpse of Hongkou

Foreigners Going to Transport Goods Must Obtain a Pass - Indian Police Direct Traffic at Each Intersection - Chinese People Cannot Go

According to the Shanghai Times, the area along Yangshupu in the Hongkou Concession has slightly returned to normal in recent days. Trucks transporting goods to and from the area are constantly arriving, especially those passing through the Waibaidu Bridge and taking Broadway Road. However, the enemy has pretexted that Des Voeux Road, Boone Road, North Sichuan Road, and Scott Road are still under special military circumstances. Except for its own nationals who can return to their former residences, other foreign nationals are still prohibited. Chinese people are absolutely not allowed to go. Foreign nationals from various countries who go to their former residences in Yangshupu or transport goods must also obtain a pass from their consulate, and sometimes even obtain a pass from the enemy's military authorities before they can pass through the Waibaidu Bridge and go north. Therefore, it will take some time for the Hongkou area to be completely unobstructed. However, one phenomenon is unprecedented, that is, Indian police are directing traffic at each intersection in Hongkou. Because the area is still in a special situation, the traffic rules are also slightly different from those south of the Suzhou River. Many roads blocked by the war cannot directly pass vehicles. However, efforts are being made to reduce these areas. The enemy police are still entrenched in the area north of Old Baccarat Road. As for the persons in charge of the public institutions of the concession, they are working hard to restore them. Once the time is ripe, this goal can be achieved. The telephone company continued to work hard during the Shanghai battle and is now planning to continue its recovery plan. The persons in charge of the coal gas company and the power company are also investigating the damaged parts of the area to repair them. Other transportation agencies are also planning to restore the pre-war state. The trolleybuses south of the Suzhou River to West Hongkou have been running from Henan Road across the Henan Road Bridge to Old Baccarat Road since Monday this week. The trams have also passed the Old Garbage Bridge to the First Special District Court. The routes of other trams and buses are also being planned for restoration.

### Rear Traffic is Cut Off, Enemy Troops in Daming are Blocked

The Yellow River Railway Bridge is Confirmed to be Blown Up - Enemy Troops in Taiyuan Invade South in Three Routes

[Beiping] The Japanese army's advance south from Daming has obviously stopped. Because a large number of Chinese troops tried to cut off their rear traffic lines a few days ago, the Japanese army must first clear the rear roads before they can advance deeply. According to Japanese official sources, four divisions of Chinese infantry, one division of cavalry, and one brigade of infantry participated in disrupting the Japanese army's rear traffic, most of which belonged to the 29th Army. It is reported that the Japanese army has not yet attempted to cross the Yellow River in the Jinpu Line area. However, the Japanese authorities have just confirmed that the Yellow River Railway Bridge has been blown up and said that 37 foreigners in Daming are now safe (Reuters, Central News Agency, 17th).

[Nanjing] According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army in Jin Province is now advancing south in three routes. The main force is currently advancing towards Linfen along the highway from Taiyuan. The Jin Province government has moved there. It is reported that the right wing is attacking Fenyang, and the left wing is advancing towards Yushe from Heshun (Reuters, Central News Agency, 17th).

### The Central Bank's Move to Beijing is Stipulated by the Organization Law

The Shanghai Branch Operates as Usual and Handles Domestic and Foreign Exchange - The Central Bank Raises the Exchange Rate for Cash Silver by Two Yuan

The general management offices of the four national banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have recently moved to the capital in accordance with the provisions of the organization law. The Shanghai branches operate as usual and handle domestic and foreign exchange, agricultural and industrial loans, commercial savings, current deposits, etc. As an encouragement to the people, the Central Bank now raises the exchange rate for raw gold and silver by two yuan according to the market price. The various branches of the Central Bank also operate as usual in Shanghai.

### After the Withdrawal of Our Military and Police from Nanshi, the French Police Department Provides Supplies

Hoping That All Sectors Will Donate More Beds, Rice, Pickled Vegetables, and Other Items

In view of the difficulties in the supply of food and other supplies after the withdrawal of our military and police from Nanshi, the French Concession Police Department has set up an office on the third floor of the YMCA in Baxianqiao, hoping that all sectors will donate. In recent days, charitable organizations and individuals have donated very enthusiastically. According to the news from the office, beds, rice, and pickled vegetables are now the most lacking and urgently needed items. It is hoped that all sectors will donate more.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegram to Zhejiang Provincial Government Requesting Issuance of Escort Permits for Rice Transport from Eastern Zhejiang

Blocking leaks and regulating surpluses benefit both sides; A temporary and urgent measure utilizing foreign ships for transport

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting the issuance of escort permits for rice transport from Eastern Zhejiang. The telegram read: "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou, we respectfully inform you that according to a letter from the Rice Merchants Association, a member association, specifically a letter from Pan Jicheng, representative of Hengsheng Rice Store on Laobeimen Street in the French Concession, it is reported that since the Shanghai war, the population of the special district has suddenly increased severalfold. Recently, with the gradual expansion of the war zone, refugees have gathered even more extensively. Consequently, the supply of food has been disrupted due to blocked transportation routes, leading to widespread panic. At the beginning of the war, we relied on Suzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, and Qingpu, among other places, to transport supplies to Shanghai via civilian boats despite the difficulties. This source provided several thousand dan of rice daily, which helped to regulate the market. Now, with the war front shifting westward and roads blocked, it is feared that restoration will be difficult in the short term. The millions of people crowded here face the danger of running out of food, and the rice stores have already sold out their stocks, lacking goods to meet demand. Ordinary citizens are struggling to find food, a truly pitiful situation that tugs at the heartstrings of those in the industry. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Special District has ordered foreign rice to supplement the supply, which will indeed stabilize the people's hearts. However, this ultimately leads to the outflow of economic interests and the depletion of our national economy. At this time of total war of resistance, every point we as citizens can block an economic leak is equivalent to adding strength to our nation. Now, various regions within our country are experiencing abundant harvests, making it unnecessary to rely on foreign rice. The only reason this is happening is that blocked transportation routes have led to a mismatch between production and sales, causing the interior to suffer from low grain prices harming farmers and an overabundance of rice. If we can regulate the situation, both sides can benefit. We have learned that the old Taizhou region in Zhejiang, including Lin'hai, Huang'yan, and Wenling counties, is the most abundant rice-producing area, and this year's harvest has also been reported as excellent. The annual export of rice from this area has historically reached a massive 200,000 to 300,000 dan. This year's harvest and sales coincided with the war of resistance, disrupting shipping routes, causing the rice-producing areas to feel a significant surplus and lacking external sales avenues. Recently, the Shanghai-Taizhou route has been temporarily maintained by foreign ships. We have consulted with the Chinese compradors on these ships about transporting rice to Shanghai from the Taizhou area. They have agreed to find ways to transport the rice, but only if the Chamber of Commerce provides certification and official permits. Therefore, our store is planning to purchase rice in the region and transport it to Shanghai to regulate the market. We propose to start with a trial purchase of 2,000 shi to be transported to Shanghai for regulation. We earnestly request your esteemed Association to present the situation to the municipal Chamber of Commerce for certification and promptly telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to approve and issue the escort permits, allowing transportation from the three counties of Linhai, Huangyan, and Wenling. However, our store cannot transport the 2,000 shi of rice in one shipment. Therefore, please set the validity period of the escort permits to three months to allow for continuous purchases and transportation, which is crucial for the people's food supply and the nation's economy. Please grant swift approval and forwarding. We have learned that Hengsheng Rice Store plans to purchase rice from the three counties of Lin, Wen, and Tai in Zhejiang to supply Shanghai's food needs during this extraordinary time and to prevent economic leaks. We dare to submit this letter for your consideration and earnestly request your esteemed Association to provide certification and promptly telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to issue escort permits, allowing the store to purchase 2,000 shi of rice in the three counties and transport it in installments within three months to relieve the people's food needs. We await your decision with utmost anticipation. When the matter came before the meeting, it was noted that since the fall of Pudong, the population of these counties seeking refuge in the concessions has increased severalfold, and inland river transportation has been cut off, obstructing rice shipments from Suzhou and Songjiang. Recently, rice stores in the concession have been relying solely on the foreign rice stored by the Municipal Council for resale, which is a temporary solution but cannot be sustained. Hengsheng Rice Store proposes to purchase 3,000 shi of rice from the three counties of Lin, Huang, and Wen in Eastern Zhejiang. Given the availability of foreign ships sailing the Shanghai-Taizhou route, this represents a practical and urgent solution. We request your esteemed Government to approve the issuance of escort permits to the rice store for purchasing 2,000 shi of rice in these three counties, with a validity period of three months, to allow for transportation in installments. This is a matter of public interest. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."

### Ten Patrol Ships Seized, Two Grain Transport Ships Not Occupied

Due to the need to supply food to lighthouse keepers on isolated islands; Customs authorities are already discussing countermeasures

Following the seizure of patrol ships and smuggling vessels belonging to the Jianghai Customs by the enemy, the customs authorities are now discussing countermeasures. However, there have been many inaccuracies in the external reports regarding the names of the ships. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has obtained the following accurate information from the Jianghai Customs:

Investigation of Ships Seized

The Jianghai Customs patrol ships seized by the enemy in Shanghai include Fuxing, Lianxing, Huaxing, Yunxing, and Wenxing, as well as one anti-smuggling vessel named Haiyan, three motorboats named Fuwei, Yongning, and Huguang, and one small steamer named Jiaoji, totaling ten vessels of various sizes. However, Liuxing and Haiguang were spared because they are grain transport ships used to supply food to lighthouse keepers on isolated islands. Therefore, the enemy did not dare to seize them.

Customs Undertaking Countermeasures

The ten seized patrol ships and anti-smuggling vessels are currently moored in the Yangshupu area and have not been sailed outside of Songhu. The total number of Chinese and foreign tax police and anti-smuggling personnel on board these ten ships is no less than six hundred. Having been forced to leave the ships, they are currently awaiting news at the Patrol Works Department. The customs authorities are already discussing countermeasures.

According to the Central News Agency, our customs patrol ships, towed by the enemy with small steamers to the Pujiang waterfront east of Lujiazui, include the largest customs patrol ship, Fuxing, now moored at buoy number 22; Wenxing, Yunxing, and Lianxing, moored at the Yangshupu Customs branch waterfront; and another vessel moored at buoy number 4 (name unknown). The dozens of small boats originally moored in Nan Huangpu, after being towed by the enemy to the Pujiang waterfront east of the Mitsubishi docks, have been painted with numbers by the enemy. It is said that they will be transferred to Wusong and the upper reaches of the Huangpu River for military use.

### Relief Efforts for Refugees Are Becoming More Enthusiastic

The Shanghai West United Benefit Association is expanding the scope of its relief efforts and providing food to refugees wandering the streets. Donations of goods from all sectors are becoming increasingly enthusiastic, and the Association has been entrusted with distributing them. Yesterday, the following items were received: Four thousand large pancakes from the Manli Barber Company, one thousand one hundred from the staff of the Ximen branch of the Bank of Shanghai, two thousand four hundred from the entire staff of the Huade Factory, two thousand seven hundred from Mr. Zhao, one thousand from Mr. Shi Zifu, two thousand from Mr. Su, one thousand and eighteen from Mr. Tang, three thousand three hundred and forty from the staff of the paint department of Butterfield & Swire, twelve packages of bread from the staff of the Lixin Accounting Firm, one thousand nine hundred and ten large pancakes and steamed buns from the tenants of Qingfu Lane, seven thousand loaves of bread from the Leather Industry Association, and one thousand Guangbing flatbreads from the Jinjiang Hotel. All of the above items have been delivered by the Association to designated locations for distribution to refugees in various districts. However, due to the large quantity of goods, there is a shortage of large sacks for transportation. Therefore, we earnestly hope that all sectors will provide more assistance. In addition, a truck is needed for borrowing to distribute food along the way. The Association will be absolutely responsible for returning it after use. Please call 35627 to arrange contact.

### Japanese Cabinet Approves Establishment of General Headquarters

All military and administrative affairs are subject to control; Preparing for a long-term war of aggression

[Tokyo] The government held a cabinet meeting yesterday and approved the establishment of the General Headquarters. Minister of the Army Sugiyama and Minister of the Navy Yonai stated that government procedures have been completed and made a statement today, saying that the war situation in both North China and Jiangnan has progressed significantly. However, the Chinese government has not ceased resistance, and the Japanese Army and Navy authorities have decided to establish the General Headquarters and take a formal wartime posture to thoroughly punish the central leadership of the Chinese government. (Allied News Agency, 17th)

[Tokyo] The General Headquarters, which will be established soon, is based on purely command authority and has no political implications. Therefore, its relationship with the cabinet will be handled through communication between the Prime Minister and the Ministers of the Army and Navy to ensure smooth operation. That is, regarding matters related to command and administration, officials from the command department and ministers from the administrative department will conduct consultations under the introduction of the Ministers of the Army and Navy. When holding Imperial Conferences, only Prime Minister Konoe will attend. That is, the Ministers of the Army and Navy lead their officials to participate in the planning of the General Headquarters. The Prime Minister, upon special order, attends the Imperial Conferences of the General Headquarters. These two will first discuss matters related to command and the government. The government, based on this, will hold cabinet meetings, decide on matters related to command authority, and handle them quickly. (Allied News Agency, 17th)

### Reports of Italian Mediation of Sino-Japanese Conflict are Inaccurate

Chen Gongbo continues to meet with the Italian Foreign Minister

[Rome] According to reliable sources, rumors that Italy is currently mediating the hostile actions between China and Japan are entirely untrue. This rumor arose because Chen Gongbo visited Rome. In fact, Chen's visit has no special political purpose. Chen was received by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 17th)

[Rome] Former Chinese Minister of Industry and Special Envoy to Europe Chen Gongbo held preliminary talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday and will continue discussions today. He is scheduled to meet with Mussolini on the 18th. Authoritative sources claim that Chen and Ciano are exchanging opinions, and no specific political issues are being discussed.

### Chairman of the League of Nations Veterans' Association Calls for Assistance to China

Letter to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference; British delegation returns to London

⊙Brussels The Chairman of the League of Nations Veterans' Association sent a letter to the Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Spaak, today, stating that since Japan has resolutely rejected any mediation, the conference should proceed with the second part of its mission, namely, providing effective material assistance to the victim of Japanese aggression—China—in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant.

### Eastern Newspaper Criticizes the Brussels Conference

Opposes interference by other countries; Strong anti-British sentiment

[Tokyo] The resolutions passed by the Brussels Conference on Sunday have aroused strong opposition from Japanese newspapers. The newspapers are deeply dissatisfied because the Brussels Conference completely disregarded Japan's argument that the Sino-Japanese problem must be resolved directly between the two countries. They are also quite indignant because the statement in the resolution that the participating countries will take joint action against Japan contains a threatening tone. The newspapers are now demanding that a policy of non-interference in China be adopted and that the Nine-Power Treaty be declared invalid. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that the Nine-Power Treaty is completely detached from reality and has become a dead letter. Japan should propose that this treaty be greatly revised or abolished. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that China dreams of interference by third parties, and foreign countries are now taking advantage of this trend. Japan has no other choice but to advance on Nanjing. Japan is prepared to deal with any situation. This should be known to China and a certain cunning country that is instigating China. The "Hochi Shimbun" also has the same tone, stating that one of the most important ways to solve this problem is to demand that Britain adopt a policy of non-interference in China, because China believes that the British sphere is its only hope. Japan must at least make it clear to the countries concerned that Japan will not abandon its actions in China until the fundamental principles of its policy have been realized. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 17th)

### Czech Republic Formally Recognizes Italy's Annexation of Abyssinia

[Rome] The Czech Minister to Italy presented his credentials to the Italian King today, addressing the Italian King as Emperor of Abyssinia, indicating that the Czech Republic has now formally recognized Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 16th)

### Short Commentary

— Prime Minister

The Executive Yuan held a meeting the day before yesterday. It was decided that Committee Member Chen Jitang generously donated a huge sum of money, estimated at HK$7 million, to support military expenses, and was granted a special award. This is appropriate. However, Chen Jitang should not only be awarded for his generous donation, but also for the considerable achievements of his military equipment during his time in Guangdong. His contributions should not be overlooked either. However, among the Chinese people, there is no shortage of the bourgeoisie like Chen, who can generously donate and ruin their families to relieve national distress. Why are they so silent that Chen alone enjoys the reputation? The fact that Chen alone enjoys the reputation cannot but make me deeply saddened for our country.

### The Enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia for Donating Money to Save the Nation

Malaya plans to raise 10 million this year in addition to what has already been donated; The Philippines, in addition to what has already been donated, will still purchase at least 4 million in bonds; Xiamen's purchase of national salvation bonds is expected to exceed 1 million

Xiamen correspondence: Donations of national defense funds and national salvation bonds are being contributed very enthusiastically by Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. According to recent news from Southeast Asia, regarding the campaign to raise national salvation bonds, the Overseas Chinese representatives from various districts of British Malaya resolved at the Double Tenth Festival conference: ㊀ It is estimated that by the end of this year, the Overseas Chinese in all of Malaya will raise at least 10,018,500 yuan, which is distributed as follows: Singapore 3 million, Kuala Lumpur 2 million, Malacca 400,000, Pahang 250,000, Kelantan 85,000, Kajang 30,000, Ipoh 1.5 million, Penang 1.2 million, Johor 1 million, Negeri Sembilan (Kyu Shu Fu) 400,000, Kedah 250,000, Terengganu 70,000. ㊂ The raised donations will not be exchanged for bonds. The chairman of the All-Malaya Relief Fund, Chen Jiageng, now donates his entire monthly salary of 2,000 yuan until the end of the war. Chen is highly respected in British territories, so his call for donations has the greatest impact. This also indirectly affects Burma and the Dutch territories. In addition, Hu Wenhu personally purchased 500,000 yuan in national salvation bonds in two installments. In the Philippines, in addition to donating more than 3.6 million yuan, they are now raising national salvation bonds, with a minimum target of 4 million yuan. In Davao City, the Overseas Chinese population is only 2,000 people, but they purchased 300,000 yuan in bonds. The chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, Li Qingquan, is in charge of donations and bond raising in the British and Philippine territories. The donations are long-term in nature, with each person donating a certain percentage of their business income or salary each month. For example, a teacher in the Philippines with a monthly salary of 90 Philippine pesos donates 18 Philippine pesos each month. The Overseas Chinese population in Malaya is 1.8 million, while in the Philippines it is only 140,000. Therefore, in terms of the amount of money, Malaya's 6 million to 10 million yuan is the largest. However, in terms of population ratio, the Philippines, with a population of 140,000, bears the burden of 7.6 million yuan, which is even greater. However, the Philippines consists of merchants and freelancers of all sizes, while the British territories mainly consist of Chinese laborers.

Xiamen and Fuzhou each donated a minimum of 800,000 yuan for national salvation bonds, which is the largest amount in the province. Xiamen is managed by various community organizations: ㊀ 300,000 from the Xiamen business community, ㊁ 300,000 from major companies, ㊂ 150,000 from Gulangyu, 60,000 from Heshan District, and ㊃ additional fundraising from wealthy households. The Gulangyu Chinese Council resolved: ㊀ Property owners will pay one and a half times the annual Municipal Council land rent, ㊁ Residents will pay half a month's rent, ㊂ Bank, company, and store employees will follow the civil servant method, and ㊃ wealthy households will be fundraised separately. Gulangyu's annual land rent is 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, so one and a half years would be 240,000 yuan, and half a month's rent would be 50,000 yuan, not including other income. The wealthy households of Xiamen and Gulangyu are mostly Overseas Chinese returning from Southeast Asia or family members of Overseas Chinese in their hometowns. Therefore, Xiamen's bond raising is expected to exceed 1 million yuan at a minimum. Quanzhou's Jinjiang County will raise 350,000 yuan, and Zhangzhou's Longxi County will raise 330,000 yuan. Jinjiang is the hometown of Overseas Chinese, and Longxi is a wealthy county, so both should be able to meet the target. (November 5th)

### Enemy Warships Harassing Guangdong Occupy Various Deserted Islands to Build Airfields

Enemy planes have been bombing the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway since the 7th

Guangzhou correspondence: The enemy aircraft carriers harassing Guangdong are unlikely to retreat anytime soon. There are still seven or eight enemy warships in the Lingdingyang and Tangjiawan areas, and about six or seven along the coast of Hainan. At the beginning of this month, enemy planes bombed various stations along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. These were all seaplanes from enemy cruisers, about eight in total. From the 1st to the 7th, the enemy planes dropped more than 70 bombs on Tiantangtuan, Tangtouxia, Shigut, Zhangmutou, Lincun, Pinghu, and Hengli along the railway. The Zhangmutou wooden bridge was destroyed. In addition, six or seventy zhang of the roadbed were destroyed at Tiantangtuan, Tangtouxia, and Tutang stations. On the 4th, passenger and freight trains on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway were suspended for one day. The following day, after repairs, traffic resumed as usual. As for the Humen waterway, it is currently calm. Only three enemy warships remain near Chiwan, outside the Humen estuary. Provincial-Hong Kong ships are now protected by British warships along the way, so the Provincial-Hong Kong and Provincial-Macau ships have resumed operations one after another. As for the whereabouts of the enemy warships, they are still elusive. The enemy cruisers in Tangjiawan sailed to other places for shelter from the wind on the afternoon of the 7th. As a result, the enemy planes on these ships did not attack for three days, from the 8th to the 10th. According to front-line intelligence, an enemy seaplane supply ship sailed to the coast of Chaoyang County on the morning of the 8th for reconnaissance and then sailed south. It seems to be carrying military supplies to replenish the aircraft on the enemy warships harassing Guangdong. One theory is that the ship sailed from the Guangdong Sea to assist the enemy forces on Kinmen Island. Since Lianshi Bay in the Guangdong Sea was occupied by the enemy, the enemy has built an airfield there, with two enemy destroyers patrolling nearby. The enemy has recently expanded the airfield and hangars on the island to accommodate a large number of heavy bombers, preparing to use it as a base for invading South China. The airfield construction is currently being carried out by hundreds of Taiwanese workers. In addition, Hebao Island, which has been occupied by the enemy, is now also used as an airfield for aircraft take-off and landing and a refueling station. In the enemy's eyes, it seems that they have not given up on invading South China. Their occupation of the above-mentioned two islands is actually to control the air force bases of Guangdong and Guangxi. (November 10th)

### Enemy Warships Threaten Stability in Chao-Shan Society (Continued)

Shantou correspondence: Chao-Shan is safe and sound amidst the storm, thanks to the cooperation between the military and the people. The enemy's naval and air forces have been constantly harassing Shantou, but they have never found an opportunity to take advantage of. The counties and cities of Chaozhou and Meizhou have gradually recovered from stability and are moving towards prosperity. Inland water and land transportation are in excellent order. Anything related to the all-out war of resistance is strictly enforced. Vehicles and boats in various counties are under unified dispatch. The highway and telephone network is gradually being completed and is under military control and protection. Conscription for road construction and training of strong men are all proceeding in accordance with the second phase of the war of resistance. The household registration in various counties and cities was completed by the end of October. Shantou City should compile 1,800 volunteer police officers, who will be trained in three phases of 600 people each. Each district will select them from the roster of strong men and complete the recruitment before November 15th. The team will be formed on the 20th, and training will begin on the 22nd. For families with two strong men, one will be selected first and the other later. For families with three strong men, each period will be assigned one person. Strong men and women all have a share of the work, such as road construction, strong men, militia, volunteer police, and sixteen other jobs to be done, allowing each person to choose one to take on. Military police in various counties are working hard to search for unemployed vagrants and strictly manage them. If a petty thief is found, he will be sentenced to hard labor to avoid increasing the consumption of the prison. The government is simultaneously carrying out land reclamation, cultivating miscellaneous grains, and increasing grain production, while also solving the livelihood of the general unemployed, so that the social foundation tends to be stable. On the other hand, it is implementing a thrift campaign. From the 15th, various counties and cities will switch to eating brown rice and prohibit the sale of white rice. It is also forbidden to use rice to make wine or to use miscellaneous grains to feed livestock, resulting in meaningless consumption. Various counties are rushing to build rice and salt storage warehouses. At this time, the South China Grain Transportation Company is transporting a large amount of rice from Hunan and Jiangxi provinces into the warehouses. The rice previously stored is gradually being opened and sold at a fair price. The production of sweet potato flour and other grains in Chaozhou is absolutely prohibited from being exported. Those who improperly consume grain in the granaries are absolutely prohibited in Chaozhou and Meizhou. The army has not only promoted eating miscellaneous grains (sweet potatoes and vegetables) one day a week, but also designated every Saturday as "Meatless Day." On this day, the market is not allowed to sell meat, and many civilians also follow suit. In this extraordinary period, everything that can save costs is followed from top to bottom, sweeping the country. This is also a major event that can be recorded to stabilize society. Recently, enemy warships anchored off the coast of Nanao and sent sailors on motorboats to chase Chaozhou fishing boats. Since the 3rd, fishing boats have not dared to go out to sea to fish. Shantou's market has returned to a state of tension. British and American ships have increased their presence in Shantou to protect Overseas Chinese. Although Chao-Shan is under the oppression and threat of the enemy, it is extremely stable everywhere.

### Situation of Overseas Chinese Returning from Japan Arriving in Xiamen

Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sends personnel to receive and send them separately; All parties in Xiamen cooperate effectively, achieving remarkable results

Xiamen correspondence: Since the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been concerned about the unsafe lives of Overseas Chinese in Japan. At the same time, Overseas Chinese, aware of the deteriorating environmental situation, are returning home one after another. Among them, there are undoubtedly those who are unable to support themselves, lack funds, and cannot return even if they want to. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs jointly discussed solutions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was responsible for instructing the embassy in Japan to ascertain the number of returning Overseas Chinese in order to prepare a budget. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission was responsible for taking care of the transportation and submitting the budget to the Executive Yuan for approval. The first phase of transportation funds was 95,000 yuan, which was remitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the embassy in Japan for distribution, either to subsidize impoverished Overseas Chinese or to charter ships for transportation. Initially, the Ministry of Transportation allocated the national ship Donghang, but the coast was sealed off.

Chartering Ships for Transportation

It was necessary to charter foreign ships instead. Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, and Incheon in Korea chartered the Litong Wheel to go directly to Weihaiwei and Yantai for round-trip transportation. As for Sinuiju and Busan, the Shenhua Wheel was chartered separately to Yantai. Overseas Chinese from Taiwan were concentrated in Kaohsiung. In addition to the majority being from Fujian, there were also those from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. On September 23rd, Rosalier Moller was chartered to transport them from Taiwan. Each time, it could carry five or six thousand people. It was estimated that three trips could complete the transportation. The daily charter was fixed at 1,750 yuan, and it made a round trip every ten days, sailing to the ports of Guangdong, Xiamen, and Shanghai so that Overseas Chinese from various provinces in Taiwan could return home as soon as possible. However, after Rosalie Moller sailed to Xiamen for the first and second batches, the third batch was not continued due to other faults. Therefore, the British ship Hildos was prepared to sail to Taiwan soon to continue transporting Overseas Chinese and sending them back to their hometowns.

Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Sends Personnel

Returning Overseas Chinese landed in the three ports of Guangdong, Xiamen, and Shanghai to take care of everything. The matters were complex. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent Chen Jingtang, Wu Tiren, and Wang Jianchen to Guangdong, Xiamen, and Shanghai to handle these matters, in conjunction with the local Overseas Chinese Affairs Offices and the local provincial and municipal governments to be responsible for transportation. Those Overseas Chinese whose registration certificates were stamped with the word "assistance" by the consulate were given an additional transportation subsidy of three yuan each.

Xiamen Situation

Xiamen is an important strategic location, not only the general assembly point for people from Fujian Province entering and leaving the country, but also a large number of people from parts of Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. The number of Overseas Chinese who had been residing in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea and returned home via Xiamen from August 16th to the beginning of November was approximately 20,000. Some were originally laborers, without possessions, and destitute. Some had their property confiscated. Dealing with transportation was extremely difficult. Fortunately, Jiangsu Province remitted 3,000 yuan, Zhejiang and Guangdong each remitted 2,000 yuan, Jiangxi 1,000 yuan, and the Fujian Construction Department allocated special vehicles and an additional 500 yuan to transport returning Overseas Chinese back to their hometowns. As for the reception in Xiamen, the municipal government, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, the Overseas Chinese Relief Association, the Overseas Chinese Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Water Police, the Garrison Command, the Anti-Enemy Association Relief Department, and charitable organizations such as Yitongren formed a Returning Overseas Chinese Management Committee to take charge of the matter. Those with assets were placed in pre-arranged inexpensive hotels after landing, with daily food and accommodation costing only 40 cents. Those in poverty were accommodated in Dashengli, provided with food and accommodation, and provided with appropriate transportation, carefully escorted. They were all registered in advance by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, and then the municipal government issued inland travel permits based on this. Recently, they have further sought to properly exempt the medical expenses of poor and sick returning Overseas Chinese in order to protect their health, provide close care, consult with Overseas Chinese about their concerns, manage transportation costs, and provide guidance on everything. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also sent personnel to cooperate fully with all parties, so that remarkable results could be achieved. (November 12th)

### The Ēndé Steamer Arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo This Morning; The Dépíng Steamer Will Sail to Ningbo as Usual

Rumors of Enemy Bombardment of Zhènhǎi Unconfirmed; Ēndé Decides to Change Route to Shanghai-Tōngzhōu Line

After the order to temporarily suspend shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the Sīdé steamer arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo this morning and changed to the Shanghai-Tōngzhōu line. The Dépíng steamer sold tickets this morning in advance, and whether it will sail to Ningbo depends on a reply from Ningbo. The Xīnběijīng steamer changed to the Shanghai-Wēnzhōu line. Details are as follows:

Ēndé Arrives in Shanghai

The Ēndé steamer of the Italian firm Huáyì Shipping Company left Ningbo at 11:00 AM yesterday and anchored outside Wúsōngkǒu at 8:00 PM that night. It entered the port at 6:00 AM this morning and docked at the Jīnlìyuán wharf. It carried a total of more than 1,200 passengers from Ningbo to Shanghai. A reporter boarded the ship this morning and met with senior crew members and passengers. They said that Ningbo was bombed by enemy planes on the 12th of this month, and people were uneasy at the time. Residents in the city fled to the countryside, resulting in a significant reduction in business for shops in the city. The area has been very peaceful in recent days. The rumor that enemy warships bombarded Zhènhǎi and attempted a landing is not true.

Changing to Other Lines

After arriving in Shanghai from Ningbo, the Ēndé steamer decided to switch to the Shanghai-Tōngzhōu line. It is scheduled to depart from the Jīnlìyuán wharf in Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 19th of this month (Friday) for Tōngzhōu. Ticket sales have already begun. Fares are 8 yuan per person for first class, 5 yuan per person for cabin class, half price for children, 2.5 yuan per person for steerage, and 1.3 yuan per person for children. The Xīnběijīng steamer has decided to switch to the Shanghai-Wēnzhōu line and is scheduled to depart from the Tàigǔ wharf in Shanghai for Wēnzhōu at 11:00 AM on the 20th of this month. Contact addresses for cargo shipping are: ① No. 19, Xiáng'ān Lane, Yuándàfǎ Road; ② No. 4, Yuántàixīnyǒng'ān Street; ③ No. 41, Tóngfēngtài Fǎdàmǎ Road.

Dépíng Sails to Ningbo

At the request of various Níngbō groups in Shanghai, the Italian firm Huáyì Shipping Company continues to maintain traffic on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. This morning, an urgent telegram was sent to the Ningbo authorities requesting permission for the Dépíng steamer to continue sailing. If permission is granted, the Dépíng will sail from Shanghai to Ningbo at 3:00 PM today. However, as of the time this article was filed, no reply had been received. Ticket sales began at 9:00 AM this morning at the company's office on Guǎngdōng Road, and the crowd of ticket buyers was very congested. The police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order and posted a notice saying, "Whether the Dépíng steamer will sail to Ningbo this afternoon depends on a decision from Ningbo. Ticket sales will proceed in advance, and refunds will be given if the ship does not sail."

Reasons for Suspension

This morning, the reporter learned from the shipping industry that the reason for the suspension of the Shanghai-Ningbo line is that the Zhènhǎi port has been blockaded by our army, prohibiting all ships from passing through. At the same time, enemy warships are patrolling outside the port. Therefore, a certain commander from that port telegraphed Shanghai-Ningbo groups to dissuade ships from sailing to Ningbo. When the Ēndé steamer arrived in Ningbo last time, a certain commander notified the ship that it would not be allowed to sail to Ningbo again, otherwise, it would be severely investigated.

### Unemployment Relief Association Responsible for Introducing Workers

Since the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee handled the registration of unemployed workers, it has now registered more than 6,000 unemployed workers with skills in machinery, electrical engineering, chemical industry, wood and earth, construction, and textile industries. Now that the order in this city has gradually recovered, and various factories will also resume operations one after another, those who need the above-mentioned staff can send a letter to mailbox No. 902, Post Office, 4th Malu. The association can be responsible for handling it on its behalf so that unemployed workers can have work to do and stabilize their livelihoods.

### Popular Organizations and All-Out Resistance

Liú Yùcái's Radio Broadcast Speech at the Ministry of Transportation

From the cannon fire of "August 13th," all of China's people have risen up solemnly to resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism. In order to protect the survival of our nation and to eliminate the suffering we have endured for decades, we have reached a point of unbearable tolerance. A nationwide salvation movement of all-out resistance has unfolded. The scope of this all-out resistance has expanded from a corner of Sōnghù to the provinces of Jiāngzhè and must continue to expand throughout the entire territory of China. Our nation's people are at such a critical juncture that no one can afford to be idle or complacent. Everyone should bear the responsibility of a citizen and participate in all aspects of the war of resistance. Here, we must pay attention to the issue of how to organize the people. Whether in the front or the rear, our organizations must have a unified plan in order to unleash the powerful forces of resistance. We know that in peacetime, whether in Shanghai or in other provinces, cities, and counties, under the guidance of local party and government organs, there are organizations of vocational groups, such as labor unions, farmers' associations, chambers of commerce, educational associations, and various other free professional groups. These many groups are normally organs for self-development. In wartime, it is necessary to mobilize the power of the groups themselves to cope with wartime needs. In other words, each group must call on its members to participate in the work of resistance. If vocational groups throughout the country can be soundly organized and, under the leadership of local party and government organs, launch an all-out resistance, I dare say that this force will be more than enough to defeat Japanese imperialism and will certainly be able to drive out the enemy. We can use past facts to prove this. In 1927, before the Northern Expeditionary Army had conquered Shanghai, the people of Shanghai rose up joyfully. In particular, the strength of more than 800,000 workers in Shanghai united as one. Without many weapons, they were all civilians who, in a powerful chorus, shouted slogans to overthrow the warlords. In just three hours, they individually defeated the powerful Feng-Lu army and occupied Shanghai. Afterward, we felt both happy and amused, because at that time, we only had dozens of guns, and later, we ran out of bullets. We shouted heroic slogans on the one hand and set off firecrackers on the other. As a result, we completely eliminated the Feng-Lu army entrenched in Shanghai. Judging from the events above, we are at such a critical juncture in this foreign war that we are so eager for this kind of power to enrich our ranks. Therefore, I am raising this issue today for discussion with all of you listeners:

First issue: I think that the existing labor unions in various places should be actively organized and, under the guidance of the highest labor organ in the locality, train workers and organize our volunteer army. In the rear, they can prevent the troublemaking of all bad elements. In the front, they can replenish the army for combat. If these two forces can be cultivated in the shortest possible time, our war of resistance will certainly achieve good results.

Second issue: I think that farmers in various places, like workers, should also organize volunteer armies or ambulance teams. In the ranks of the anti-Japanese volunteer army this time, the majority of participants are peasant masses. In the near future, we have inspected the result of the Sujia highway side, and received a very good impression. The strong team along the way is made up of local farmers. They are as alert as the army, they also have a full war of the field knowledge, it is very able to maintain the rear of the security, if the farmers' associations in various places can lead farmers, train farmers, to participate in the work of resistance, then the defeat of Japanese imperialism, and more a new force, our victory, is more fully assured.

Third issue: I believe that the student military training units in various places, at this critical juncture of survival, the military instructors of each school should be ready to go and concentrate the original number of people to launch the war of resistance. When necessary, they must also go to the front line to risk their lives with others. Although we are very reluctant to sacrifice many young students, the future construction of the country will depend on the current young students to continue to take responsibility. However, the crisis of the country has reached the point where it is necessary for all people to rise up to resist the powerful enemy. As long as they are Chinese, they should rise up to participate in the war of resistance. The achievements of the student army were already very evident during the Northern Expedition. Now we hope very much that the leaders of the academic community will jointly organize a student anti-Japanese volunteer army to accelerate the defeat of Japanese imperialism!

Fourth issue: I think that the people in various places who have received civic training should also rise up to concentrate and launch the power of battle in various aspects, especially for the work of preventing traitors. It is most appropriate to have the public training militia take on this kind of work, because the public training people are usually scattered in various vocational institutions. The local situation is of course fully understood, so they have the full ability to prevent or eliminate the activities of traitors. At the same time, it is also destroying the enemy's troublemaking and increasing the strength of the war of resistance. When necessary, this army can also join the regular army to fight the enemy.

Fifth issue: I believe that the people in other free professional circles can also voluntarily organize various salvation groups to participate in various front and rear war of resistance services and achieve unified action with the war of resistance groups in various circles. In this way, our power for all-out resistance is so strong that we are more fully confident in defeating Japanese imperialism. If the people in various places across the country have this kind of organization and, under the leadership of the local party and government organs, launch an all-out resistance together, the final victory can certainly be predicted.
