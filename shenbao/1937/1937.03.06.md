Under-Secretary of State Cranborne replied that the draft constitution had been announced in May 1936, and the National Assembly, originally scheduled to be convened in November 1936, had been postponed to November this year. The Ambassador had reported on this matter and would continue to provide detailed reports, so further instructions were unnecessary. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fourth)

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Revises and Passes the Implementing Regulations of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law

(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 93rd meeting on the morning of the 5th, with 65 members including Chen Changheng present. Chairman Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. The meeting revised and passed the Implementing Regulations of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law drafted by the Finance Committee, and resolved that the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law should be implemented on January 1, 1938, and that the budget and its execution for the year 1937 should continue to be handled as usual, and should be submitted to the National Government for approval and compliance. During the discussion of the case, a fierce debate arose among the committees regarding judicial expenses. Article 17 of the original draft stipulated that "The expenses of the central government in exercising judicial power in the localities shall be borne by the central government, and all judicial revenues shall belong to the central government. If the revenues and expenditures are insufficient, the localities may be ordered to assist as appropriate." Ma Yinchu, Zhao Huan, Xiao Shuyu, and others argued that the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law had stipulated that the expenses required by the central government to exercise judicial power in the localities should be borne by the central government, but now the implementing regulations stipulated that if these expenses were insufficient, the localities could be ordered to assist as appropriate, and that there were obvious discrepancies in the legislation before and after. Moreover, since all judicial revenues now belonged to the central government, it would be even more burdensome for the localities to bear the insufficient judicial expenditures, and the central government seemed to be infringing on the localities. They all advocated deleting the article. Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, and others argued that the current shortfall in local judicial expenses was being assisted by the localities, and that without this provision, the central government would have to increase an expense, which the national treasury might not be able to afford. Therefore, they advocated maintaining the original proposal, but Chen advocated making textual revisions to the article, and Wei advocated adding a time limit to the section on ordering local assistance, limiting it to three years. In addition, Chen Guyuan also proposed an amendment. After the chairman submitted it for a vote, the result was that the proposal to delete the article by Ma and others was passed by a majority, and the article was deleted. The full text consists of 19 articles, with the main points as follows: ㊀The percentage of income tax distributed to provinces, cities, and counties by the central government in the first year of implementation of these regulations shall be determined by the central government in accordance with the standards stipulated in Article 4 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, and shall be redetermined every three years thereafter. As for the portion of income and inheritance taxes distributed to provinces, cities, and counties, it shall be allocated by the central government in a unified manner. ㊁The portion of business tax distributed to counties and cities shall be determined by the respective provincial governments and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. ㊂The original tooth tax, pawn tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes of a business tax nature in various localities shall be changed to business tax, and the tooth stamp tax, pawn stamp tax, slaughter household license tax, and other taxes of a business license tax nature shall be changed to business license tax. ㊃The land tax and land improvement tax shall be determined in the first year of implementation of these regulations in accordance with the standards stipulated in Article 7 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law. The percentage allocated to the province shall be proposed by the county and city governments and submitted to the provincial government for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. The percentage of land tax allocated to the central government by cities directly under the Executive Yuan shall be proposed by the city government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and shall be redetermined every three years thereafter. In the provinces, cities, and counties that have not implemented land tax in accordance with the Land Law, the allocation of land tax shall be subject to the preceding provisions. ㊄Provinces, cities, and counties may continue to collect and allocate deed tax in areas where land tax has not been implemented in accordance with the Land Law. ㊅The original boat tax and vehicle tax in various provinces, cities, and counties shall be changed to boat and vehicle license tax. Usage fees may be collected for boats and vehicles passing through for the improvement and equipment of waterways and roads. ㊆Provinces, cities, and counties shall immediately abolish any double taxation or surcharges on existing central taxes, but if there are special circumstances where funds for compensation have not yet been raised, the Executive Yuan may be requested to abolish them in phases, or the central government may take them back for reorganization and provide subsidies, up to a maximum of three years. ㊇Special monopoly industries established by provinces, cities, and counties shall be taken over by the central government in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, but if funds for compensation for the original monopoly income have not yet been raised, the central government may subsidize them, for a maximum of three years. ㊈When provinces, cities, and counties levy special taxes in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, the project plans, expenditure estimates, and collection methods shall be submitted to the higher-level government for approval before they can be included in the budget. ㊉The award money stipulated in Article 19 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law shall be limited to informants, personnel directly involved in investigation and enforcement, and military police. ㊉㊀When provinces, cities, and counties stipulate exclusive prices in accordance with the provisions of Article 22 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, if their legislative bodies have not yet been established, they shall submit them to the competent higher-level authority for approval. ㊉㊁The matters exempt from customs duties stipulated in Article 28 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law shall be temporarily subject to the existing precedents and methods for exemption from customs duties before the Customs Law is promulgated. ㊉㊂The banks exempt from bank income tax stipulated in Article 30 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law shall be limited to those with completely government-owned shares, unless otherwise stipulated by law. ㊉㊃The amount of subsidies and assistance provided by the provincial government to its subordinate counties and cities shall be determined first and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. ㊉㊄The amount of allocation of income tax, inheritance tax, business tax, land tax, and land improvement tax, and the amount of government subsidies and assistance, shall be notified to the lower-level governments by the higher-level governments one month before the budget is prepared. ㊉㊅When provinces, cities, and counties borrow money in accordance with the provisions of Article 42 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, if their legislative bodies have not yet been established, they shall first obtain the approval of the higher-level government. ㊉㊆Governments at all levels shall gradually increase the expenditures for education, culture, economic construction, health, medical treatment, childcare, relief, etc. stipulated in Article 49 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law to the standard amount stipulated in that article within five years.

Current Commentary

### Economy and Diplomacy

— Hua

In modern international relations, economy and diplomacy have formed a very important link. Not only is it important, but this link is also very subtle. The increase in economic relations between countries sometimes indicates the development of genuine friendship, and sometimes, on the contrary, indicates the deepening of aggression and domination. Therefore, in international relations, we often hear the beautiful term "economic cooperation." In some cases, it can be expressed as a sincere diplomatic attitude, while in other cases, it can be seen as a cover for aggressive diplomatic activities.

Because economy and diplomacy are so closely related, the recent visit to China by the Japanese economic delegation has attracted special attention from all parties. This delegation is led by Kenji Kodama, chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association. The importance of its representatives and the news publicity before its departure make us aware that its mission is by no means limited to "economy." According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 3rd, Kodama said in his interview with reporters, "The two major countries in East Asia should focus on the overall situation, cooperate with each other, and strive to ease various frictions and eliminate the current unpleasant situation as soon as possible to make it clear." He also mentioned "economic cooperation," believing that now "the general public sincerely feel that the improvement of friendly relations between China and Japan and the harmony of the two peoples are prerequisites." These words coincide with the rhythm revealed by Prime Minister Hayashi in his policy speech not long ago. From this, we can imagine that the diplomatic significance of Kodama's economic delegation's visit to China is actually greater than its economic significance.

In a few days, this "economic envoy" group will be visiting our country. To be honest, we, the generally generous and kind Chinese people, always welcome guests from afar. We also try our best to trust the meaning of Kodama's expressed "extremely innocent" intentions. However, to be more honest, in recent years, we, the generous and kind Chinese people, have gained a lot of bitter lessons in the great changes of the world and in our own experiences. For example, the close relationship between economy and diplomacy is one of the lessons we have learned. And before the arrival of this distinguished guest, we have to recall this lesson.

Speaking from our own experience, in recent years, we have often heard the beautiful term "economic cooperation." It seems to be more popular in North China than elsewhere. But what are the benefits that North China has received from "economic cooperation"? The first is the seizure of customs, the second is the rampant smuggling, and the third, fourth, and all subsequent results are that our economic resources are gradually becoming appendages to someone else's "quasi-wartime economic system." We certainly do not want to suspect others' "malice," but we have already felt a cruel lesson that goes beyond "malice" under the beautiful term "economic cooperation." In the broader aspects of the world, if we want to briefly mention one or two examples out of countless ones, Cuba in the Americas would be one. The economic relationship between the United States and Cuba is the closest. But all the sweetness of Cuba, the "sugar bowl," is tasted by the Americans. What Cuba itself gets is only the bitter taste of armed intervention.

Thus, the enthusiastic expectations for this "friendly country" guest, combined with the cruel lessons of reality, make us unable to be optimistic. However, Kodama's "courageous" conclusion in his interview with reporters, saying that it is necessary to firmly respect China's territorial sovereignty in politics, is worth pondering. Because without this fundamental political condition, so-called "economic cooperation" is indeed just a cover to achieve certain diplomatic purposes. If Kodama has a sincere feeling for this conclusion, we hope that he will either first take the road through our Northeast and then go south when he comes to our country, or go to the outside of the Great Wall to take a look after visiting our South. Because that place belongs to China's territorial sovereignty, but now it is planted with the flags of other countries.

### French Cabinet Decides on Measures to Save the Financial Crisis

Saving Budget of 6 Billion Francs; No Issuance of Public Debt Except for National Defense; Private Individuals Permitted to Freely Import Gold

(Paris) The Council of Ministers recently discussed financial issues at its meeting this morning and issued a public statement stating that France's financial policy is still based on the currency agreement reached by Britain, France, and the United States on September 25 of last year. Therefore, it does not intend to impose controls on exchange matters, but will request the Bank of France to allow private individuals to freely import gold and freely buy and sell gold coins domestically. The Bank of France will purchase gold from the 8th of this month according to the daily market price. The Council of Ministers also appointed Bank of France Governor Labeyrie, former Vice Governor Professor Rist, Baudouin, General Manager of the Banque de l'Indochine, and Roueff, Deputy Director of the Exchange Equalization Fund of the Ministry of Finance, to form a committee to manage the exchange equalization fund to maintain the current price of the franc and to monitor the domestic public debt market. In terms of finance, the Council of Ministers instructed all competent authorities not to request additional funds beyond the regular budget and decided to reduce the funds contained in the 1937 budget by 6,000,000,000 francs, while stipulating that no other debts should be issued during this fiscal year except for national defense bonds. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fifth)

(Paris) The Ministry of Finance recently issued a public statement stating that the Council of Ministers will take some appropriate measures regarding the financial situation at its meeting tomorrow, but their nature will not be exceptional. As for the rumors that the government will stabilize the price of the franc and take new legislative plans in finance, and that Bank of France Governor Labeyrie will resign, they are not true. In addition, responsible parties have also firmly denied that the cabinet will be reorganized and said that the government does not intend to appoint new cabinet members, and there will be no changes to the current list of cabinet members. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fourth)

(Paris) Well-informed financial sources recently declared that the Council of Ministers will decide on the following measures at its meeting tomorrow:

㊀Stabilize the price of the franc according to the current parity.

㊁Take some important measures in finance, but any policy that aims to induce foreign exchange managers will not be adopted.

㊂Establish a Financial Advisory Committee to assist the Ministry of Finance and monitor the financial situation. Former Vice Governor of the Bank of France, the famous economist Rist, and Baudouin, former Director of the Ministry of Finance, will be hired as committee members.

In addition, financial figures firmly deny the rumors that the cabinet will be reorganized and that Bank of France Governor Labeyrie will resign. Also, Finance Minister Olivol held talks with Gayot and Vallière, the chairmen of the finance committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, this evening to prepare for the measures to be taken at tomorrow's Council of Ministers meeting. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fourth)

(Paris) The Council of Ministers is scheduled to discuss financial issues at 10:00 this morning. Well-informed sources believe that as a result of the meeting, the gold content of the franc will still be based on the current standard of 0.046 grams, and the layer that the rightists have spread, that is, it should be reduced to 0.044 grams, is not accurate. In addition, the talks held yesterday by the French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, and the US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, are generally believed to be related to the issue of franc stability, but officials refuse to express their opinions. As for the government, it will avoid using various methods such as controlling exchange rates and controlling the flow of private funds. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fifth)

(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau held talks with the French Ambassador Bonnet today. Afterwards, Morgenthau issued a statement to the press stating that the US government is very concerned about the French financial situation and that he had demonstrated this during his meeting with Ambassador Bonnet. "We will continue to do our best to cooperate economically with France, but the spirit of our various existing laws must still be observed." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fourth)

(Paris) The Bank of France recently released its weekly report. The important figures of assets and liabilities are briefly listed as follows: On the asset side, cash reserves remain at 57,358,000,000 francs. Various commercial bills increased by 1,027,000,000 francs to 10,167,000,000 francs. On the liability side, the amount of banknotes in circulation increased by 1,682,000,000 francs to 87,512,000,000 francs. The reserve ratio decreased from 55.36 percent to 54.75 percent.

### British House of Commons Passes the National Defense Loan Bill on Third Reading

Churchill Also Spoke in Support; Germany Has 1,500 Heavy Cannons

(London) The British National Defense Loan Bill has been passed on third reading in the House of Commons today. The bill grants the government the right to borrow 400 million pounds within five years. When the bill was proposed for third reading, the Labor Party moved to abolish it, but the parliament finally passed it by 241 votes to 117 votes. Thereupon, the bill was transferred to the House of Lords. The most noteworthy speech in today's debate was the great statesman Churchill expressing his delight at the government's measures to reorganize the military. He said that the government's five-year military plan, the greatness of Britain's financial resources, the support of all parties and factions, and the welcome of all countries in the world, especially small countries, are sufficient to prove that it is in the interest of all autonomous regions and foreign countries to follow suit.

Churchill further said that Britain's current diplomatic policy is based on the League of Nations Covenant and the special agreement between Britain and France, which is what the public wants. If Britain can continue to implement its national defense policy for four or five years, then Britain will be in a safer and more suitable position since Germany reorganized its military.

Churchill continued that the current air force estimate has not yet been submitted to the parliament. He said that judging from the current situation, the air force estimate will require about 60 to 70 million pounds to be allocated from public debt.

Churchill expressed regret that the government's proposal did not include the number of armaments that can be obtained in the military construction program and their specific dates. It is said that Germany, in addition to the heavy cannons that have already been installed, still has 1,500 heavy cannons. He asked when Britain will have 1,500 reliable and latest heavy cannons and trained soldiers and appropriate equipment.

Churchill further declared that the British House of Commons can no longer continue to ignore the great problem of national security, especially after the government has admitted that its predictions were wrong. He asked the government whether it could guarantee that the strength of the British Air Force would increase this year, and that the difference between its current strength and that of the German Air Force would not be too great, or that the German Army would not permanently maintain its superiority over France. Churchill further said that today's understanding between Britain and France is nothing less than a defensive alliance for those who carry out aggression without provocation, and the friendship between the two countries is the greatest guarantee for the continued existence of peace or mutual survival.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain then spoke after Churchill and concluded the debate. He said that the parliament's discussion has fully demonstrated that the House of Commons has a real, universal, and fundamental understanding of the need for national military reorganization. Although the opposition party claimed that Britain's military equipment exceeded the needs of reality, and said that when Britain was attacked, other countries would rise up to help, etc., at the same time, when other countries were attacked, Britain would rise up to help them, so Britain's burden has increased rather than decreased.

Chamberlain further stated that Britain has no obligation under the League of Nations Covenant to assist other countries with force when they are attacked.

Chamberlain did not reply, expressing his deep belief that the military policy pursued by the British government is a necessary preliminary step before the final period of military reduction. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fourth)

### British Air Force Budget Published

First-Line Aircraft: 1,500

(London) The Air Force budget has been released today. The gross expenditure totals £88,588,600, and the net expenditure totals £56,500,000. It includes a plan to significantly increase the British Air Force. The main points are summarized as follows: As of April 1, the Air Force will consist of one hundred squadrons within the country, equivalent to twenty squadrons, and twenty-six squadrons serving overseas. The number of officers will increase to 4,640 on the same day, and the number of airmen will increase to 51,000. The strength of the Air Force in the metropolitan area will increase to one hundred and twenty squadrons by the summer, including twenty auxiliary air squadrons. There will be a total of 1,500 aircraft on the first line of battle. These squadrons will be expanded to bring the total strength of front-line aircraft to 1,750, as mentioned in the defense statement last March.

As of December 1, 1936, the strength of the British Air Force was as follows: sixty regular air squadrons serving within the country, sixteen auxiliary air squadrons, twenty squadrons attached to the fleet, and twenty-one squadrons serving overseas. There are currently six factories under construction to manufacture aircraft engines, most of which will be completed within a few months. Two factories for manufacturing aircraft fuselages are also under construction. In addition, new factories for manufacturing aerial propellers and bombs are currently under construction. The budget includes a special subsidy of £26,000,000 related to national defense loans; otherwise, the total would be £82,500,000, an increase of £31,800,000 compared to £50,700,000 in 1936. The difference between gross and net expenditure, £32,088,000, will be covered by £26,000,000 from loans and £6,088,600 from various revenues, such as income from national civil airports and contributions to imperial air defense from autonomous territories and colonial governments. The largest part of the expenditure, apart from the £26,000,000 allocated from loans, is £3,882,000 approved by the Admiralty for air force expenses attached to the fleet.

Civil aviation expenditure is £2,315,000, an increase of £1,555,000 compared to 1936, mainly due to the development of imperial aviation business.

The budget also proposes the establishment of ten special units in the auxiliary air force for use in the defense of the London area. The organizational work of the balloon squadron related to the plan is currently underway, and the required balloons and equipment have been ordered, with some already manufactured and delivered.

Air Force salaries total £8,466,000, an increase of £1,776,000 compared to 1936.

The budget stipulates that the expenditure for land acquisition and factory construction is £8,000,000, an increase of £8,650,000 compared to 1936. £14,000,000 of this expense will be paid from loans.

At the end of 1933, there were fifty-four airfields within the country, thirty-four of which have been permanently or temporarily expanded. Now, thirteen new airfields have been added, and five civil airfields have been equipped for aviation business. In addition, twenty-six airfields are under construction, and site selection and construction will continue this year. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters)

### Yugoslavia Opposes Austrian Restoration

Prime Minister Issues Statement to Parliament; Members Applaud in Support

⊙Yugoslavia. Regarding the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family in Austria, Yugoslavia has once again expressed its firm opposition. This afternoon, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović gave a speech in Parliament on the diplomatic situation, mentioning Yugoslavia's relationship with Austria, saying, "Certain circles in Austria are currently continuing to promote the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family, but we sincerely hope that the responsible persons in Austria will find ways to avoid any actions tending towards restoration, because such actions will inevitably cause serious disturbances in Central Europe." At this point in the Prime Minister's speech, all the members applauded in support. The Prime Minister continued, "The Yugoslav government has always adopted a completely negative attitude towards the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family, and will maintain this attitude in the future."

### Disturbance Occurs in Morocco

Spanish Nationalist Army Plans to Protest to Britain and France

⊙Salamanca. The Nationalist Army radio station here broadcast a startling message this afternoon, stating that the Spanish Nationalist Army government has received reports that various activities are taking place in the area bordering Spanish Morocco and French Morocco, with the aim of causing disturbances in Spanish territory so that the French Moroccan authorities can use the pretext of restoring order and preventing native tribes from migrating out of the country to invade Spanish territory. It is alleged that this type of activity violates the international obligations stipulated in the Treaty of Algeciras (signed by Britain, Germany, France, Spain, and other countries on April 7, 1906) and endangers European peace. For this reason, the Nationalist Army government has lodged a protest with each signatory to the treaty, requesting that an international committee be organized immediately to investigate the truth. In addition, the Nationalist Army government will also submit a negotiation on this issue to the London Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee. (Central News Agency, 5th, Havas)

### Roosevelt Speech: America's Current Crisis

Judges Hinder the Interests of Farmers and Workers; the Judicial System Must Be Reformed

(Washington) President Roosevelt spoke at the Democratic Party's "Celebration Dinner" tonight, calling on the nation's farmers and workers to support the Supreme Court system reform plan, saying that the majority decisions of the Supreme Court justices have made it impossible for the government to help the nation's farmers and workers, and have jeopardized the Tennessee Valley Authority and Social Security Act. The most pressing issue facing America today is to ensure the economic freedom of farmers, workers, and small business owners, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled the Agricultural Adjustment Act and other laws unconstitutional. In that case, what else can this Congress do? The government has done everything in its power to raise wages, reduce working hours, abolish child labor, and eliminate unfair practices in the business world, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly hindered it, and soon the Railroad Workers' Retirement Act, the National Recovery Act, and the Guffey Coal Act will all be declared invalid. At the same time, the state of New York cannot set a minimum wage for female workers. From this point of view, neither the federal government nor the state government has the right to manage these matters. Then, how should these most difficult factual problems be resolved? Although only two of the locks built by the Tennessee Valley Authority have been completed, the river valley has been spared flooding this year. However, a preliminary court has now issued a ruling to stop the Authority from performing its duties, and its future is unknown. In addition, if the Ohio River Valley and drought-stricken areas are to be dredged and irrigated, this will conflict with the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. In that case, should the lives and property of the people be sacrificed to accommodate the clauses? Therefore, the court's attitude has jeopardized the government's entire plan, such as assistance to the disabled, women, and children, as well as unemployment insurance, old-age security, and deposit insurance. Democrats, for the sake of the entire party and individuals, should remove these obstacles. (4th, National Telegram)

### Philippine President Quezon Appeals to Americans

Philippine Economy Is at a Disadvantage; the United States Should Be Responsible for Developing the Philippines

(Washington) Philippine President Quezon gave a speech today, saying that the current economic and political relationship between the Philippines and the United States is absurd. Since the implementation of the Independence Act, the only effect has been to divide the sovereignty of the United States and the Philippine autonomous government. We must correct this in both theory and practice, otherwise the great achievements of the United States in the Philippines will be thrown into a void. If the United States can conclude a reciprocal trade agreement with the Philippines, as the United States has concluded with Cuba, it will benefit both countries. Quezon discussed President Roosevelt's sugar production issue with Agriculture Secretary Wallace this morning and requested the passage of the sugar subsidy bill, but this subsidy has not been extended to the Philippines. However, Quezon said that returning the domestic tax to the Philippines is better than subsidizing Philippine sugar merchants. Quezon continued, when the Philippines approved the Independence Act, it thought that the Act was a treaty between the two countries, and the economic relationship between the two countries would be fixed and unchanged. But soon, the US Congress passed the Coconut Oil Domestic Tax Law, and the sugar production control bill did not stipulate subsidies for Philippine merchants, nor did it state that the domestic tax would be returned to the Philippines. All of this makes Filipinos feel uneasy about the US Congress's attitude towards Philippine trade. Sometimes we are considered part of the United States, and sometimes we are considered uncivilized. Anything that is beneficial to Filipinos is considered uncivilized, and anything that is detrimental to Filipinos seems to be part of the United States. What I am saying is not unfounded, because all Filipinos know to be grateful to the United States. Quezon did not express his opinion on future changes to the Independence Act, only saying that the United States should be responsible for developing the Philippines, but one of the two governments must have the right to handle it freely. Currently, the powers of the two governments are very confused, and we should find a way to save it. This speech was delivered at a welcome meeting of the National Press Club, attended by 2,000 journalists, as well as Under Secretary of State Sayre, US Military Advisor to the Philippines General MacArthur, and many of Quezon's entourage. (4th, National Telegram)

(Washington) The Foreign Policy Research Association's weekly report published an article by柏波, stating that after President Roosevelt's talks with Philippine President Quezon and US Military Advisor to the Philippines General MacArthur, the US foreign policy towards the Philippines will be clarified. The results of the US-Philippine economic conference may determine the fate of the Philippine autonomous government. If the Philippine economy is not greatly adjusted to compensate for the lost US market, Filipinos may fall into social and political turmoil. The way to maintain the stability of the Philippine government is to amend the articles of the Independence Act, allowing Filipinos to increase tariffs, and providing Filipinos with technical and financial assistance to develop agriculture and industry, or to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement with Filipinos. As for military plans, they will constitute a serious danger, because this military organization may not be able to resist naval blockade, but can be used to create a dictatorial politics.麦克纳's succession as US High Commissioner to the Philippines is ominous. His proximity to the US Army faction may lead him to abuse his power, sacrificing urgent social plans to promote military plans. (4th, National Telegram)

### Japanese Government Decides to Ship Cash to the United States

15 Million Yuan; More Will Be Shipped Later

(Tokyo) The government has decided to ship the first batch of cash, 50 million yuan, abroad. This cash was purchased by the government from the public before the gold export ban and the promulgation of the Bank of Japan Gold Purchase Law in April 1934, and stored in the Bank of Japan. After being shipped to the United States, it will be exchanged for US currency and deposited in the New York branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank, and used as the government's foreign payment when necessary. This cash will be shipped in installments. The first shipment will load 18.5 million yuan in cash held by the Osaka Mint onto the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) Asama Maru. The ship will depart from Kobe on the 9th and is scheduled to arrive in San Francisco on the 24th. The insurance premium will be borne by the government. (5th, Domei)

(Tokyo) Finance Minister Yuki, in order to prevent the decline of exchange rates and maintain the standard, decided to ship gold to the United States and has obtained cabinet approval. He issued the following statement on the 4th: The government believes it is necessary to maintain Japan's current exchange rate standard and has always taken appropriate measures to this day. However, since last year, merchants have speculatively imported goods, causing import exchange rates to increase sharply for a time. This time, it is considered appropriate to replenish foreign funds, so it has been decided to ship cash worth 50 million yuan to the United States in several installments. Furthermore, the government now believes that it is necessary to ship a considerable amount of cash to the United States when necessary. Needless to say, this method has no impact on Japan's legal tender reserves. (5th, Domei)

### New York Mayor Ridicules Hitler as a Brown-Shirted Madman in Speech to Jews

Germany Protests to the United States for Insulting Its Leader; US State Department Declares It Will Investigate and Respond

(Berlin) According to local newspapers, at a meeting of the women's group of the American Jewish Congress, New York Mayor La Guardia gave a speech mentioning Chancellor Hitler, calling him a "brown-shirted madman who endangers European peace." People here are very angry, and the press has unanimously criticized it. The Nazi Party's official newspaper published this news on the front page, with the following headline in large print: "The Jewish Mayor of New York Insults the German Chancellor with Obscene Words." The newspaper's editorial stated, "Because La Guardia insulted the German Chancellor, we must ask the US government how it will ensure that its territory respects the most basic international etiquette." (4th, National Telegram)

(Washington) The German government today protested to the State Department through its ambassador to the United States against New York Mayor La Guardia's speech. It is claimed that La Guardia, in a speech to the women's department of the American Jewish Congress, proposed setting up a "chamber of horrors" at the 1939 World's Fair in New York, the most important exhibit of which should be German Chancellor Hitler. After receiving the protest, Secretary of State Hull informally expressed his apology for the content of the speech and stated that he had thoroughly investigated the truth of the matter. However, observers said that the State Department has no control over the statements made by local government officials. It is recalled that last year, when the German ship Bremen was in New York, anti-Nazi elements boarded the ship and rioted, and several people were arrested. Later, a judge released them in court, and called the German flag a "black flag of pirates." Germany also protested, and the State Department apologized, but also stated that the federal government could not interfere with the officials of local governments. (4th, National Telegram)

(New York) New York Mayor La Guardia himself, after hearing the news of the German government's protest, quipped, "This is absolutely correct, they should protest, because as far as I know, there is not a single artist or sculptor in the world who can depict the Nazi government's dignitaries, Hitler himself, or the German government, so vividly. My words and descriptions of Hitler have not even reached a fraction of his true self, so it is right to provoke the German government's protest." (4th, Havas)

### Compatriots in Northeast China Are Brutally Trampled Upon by Ronin and Traitorous Scoundrels

Ronin and Traitorous Scoundrels Extort Valuables from Good People Under the Protection of the Military Police

Shenyang Correspondence: Our more than 30 million compatriots in Northeast China have been subjected to the brutal rule of the Japanese puppet regime and trampled underfoot for more than five years. As if this were not enough, a certain military police unit colludes with ronin and traitorous scoundrels who have lost all conscience to exploit the good people, causing innocent people to be unable to live or die. All kinds of tragic situations are indescribable. For example, a certain military police officer in Shenyang colluded with ronin and traitorous scoundrels, totaling more than 40 people, to extort valuables and cash from good people. From July of last year to February of this year, the number of good people who have been victimized is countless, causing resentment among the four classes of people. The matter has become serious. Later, a senior officer of the military police headquarters learned of this and said that it was detrimental to the military's reputation. He used a trick, falsely claiming to report it, and did not admit that the certain military police officer had committed this act, blaming all the guilt on the ronin and traitorous scoundrels. Among the more than 40 people who were reported, it was believed that there were secret agents of the pseudo-military police. In reality, when extorting valuables from good people, some wore military police uniforms and some held official documents and name cards. Their actions included intimidation and robbery, or falsely accusing people of communicating with the volunteers and extorting wealth, ranging from several thousand yuan to as little as several dozen yuan. If good people resisted slightly, they would immediately suffer disaster. The names of the ronin and traitorous scoundrels who were reported are listed below: (1) Cang Yi Iwao, 27 years old; Ban Ying Fu, 27 years old; Kobayashi Saichiro, 28 years old; Saito Hiroo, 39 years old; Kumano Seitaro, 37 years old; Uchiyama Nakamasa, 32 years old; Yamashita Haruichi, 32 years old; Aoki Wazaburo, 43 years old; Yamahata Yoshio, 27 years old; (2) Koreans: Kim Ki-jeom, 21 years old; Zou Yushan, 22 years old; Lee Jung-hak, 23 years old; (3) Traitorous Scoundrels: Zhang Xingya, 35 years old; Fu Yingqiao, 30 years old; Li Zichen, 18 years old; Tian Zhendong, 23 years old; He Fengjun, 31 years old; Wang Mingshan, 24 years old; Zhao Guixuan, 26 years old; Li Wenyou, 23 years old; Liu Mingyuan, 33 years old; Dai Changzhong, 31 years old; Chen Chunfang, 34 years old; Wang Mingchang, 38 years old; Chen Shituan, 22 years old; Gao Yongku, 26 years old; Chen Futang, 30 years old; Zhao Fuchun, 34 years old; Wang Zhenyu, 29 years old; Yi Wanjia, 40 years old; Yu Hongtao, 49 years old; Tian Baorong, 24 years old. Among the above people, some do work in a certain military police unit, and some are plainclothes military police. Most of the rest are unemployed vagrants. Among them, there are also employees of companies and shops, who also have the mission of the military police unit. On the Korean side, they are all unemployed ronin. Among the traitorous scoundrels, the members are the most mixed, such as district chiefs, police officers, teachers, inn waiters, soldiers, rickshaw pullers, and merchants. The places where victims are located, in addition to Shenyang city and township, also include Hailong County, Qingyuan County, Liaoyang County, and the pseudo-Andong Province, Tonghua County, Andong County, and towns. The number is incalculable. As for the entire Northeast, there are countless similar situations that have not yet been revealed to the world.

### After the Fall of the "Chang Geng" Aircraft into the River, Both Passenger and Pilot Drowned

The Guangdong-Guangxi Government Graciously Commemorates Dr. Wu Bofan; Officials Dispatched to Assist with Post-Mortem Affairs

Guangzhou Correspondence: The Southwest China Airlines "Chang Geng" aircraft, en route from Guangzhou to Guangxi on the 22nd, encountered fog and crashed in Sanshui County, with the plane and all aboard sinking into the river, as previously reported. Due to severe weather that day, the plane was forced to descend. However, while attempting to land on a sugarcane field, the aircraft struck a river embankment and flipped into the river near Shangduan Fengxiang. The mechanical parts had failed, and the large aircraft tilted into the water before quickly sinking. The pilot, Zhan Daoyu, and passenger Wu Bofan (a Shaanxi representative invited by Li Bai of Guangxi Province to travel from Guangdong to Guilin via chartered plane) drowned. After the accident, local villagers who witnessed the scene reported it to the county government, which immediately informed the provincial authorities and related departments. Southwest China Airlines immediately dispatched technicians to Sanshui, accompanied by an adjutant from the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, to recover the bodies of Wu and Zhan. After discovering traces of aviation fuel on the river's surface, they dragged the wrecked aircraft out of the water and recovered the bodies of Wu and Zhan. On the 24th, a dedicated train on the Guangzhou-Sanshui railway transported the bodies back to Guangzhou. Xiang Hanping, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Route Army, personally attended the memorial service for Mr. Wu. Wu's body was taken to the Yueguang Company for funeral arrangements. Xiang also sent two adjutants from the headquarters to handle Wu's post-mortem affairs. The body of the pilot, Zhan Daoyu, was also taken to Yueguang Company for funeral arrangements, overseen by Southwest China Airlines. The company telegraphed Zhan's family in Qiongya (Zhan's ancestral home) to come to Guangzhou for the funeral and offered condolences, in accordance with relevant regulations. As for Wu Bofan, a scientific inventor and consultant to the Shaanxi Provincial Government, who was on an official mission from Guangdong-Guangxi province, the authorities greatly valued his presence. Now, having tragically lost his life in service, Xiang Hanping, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Route Army, dispatched an adjutant to join a special envoy from the Guangxi authorities in Guangzhou to organize Wu's funeral arrangements. They also telegraphed his family to come to Guangzhou to transport Wu's coffin back to his ancestral home in Hubei for burial. A grand memorial service for Dr. Wu Bofan will be held during the day to honor his memory and talent. Li Zongren of Guangxi Province, recognizing Wu's unfortunate demise as a great loss to the academic community, telegraphed Kan Zonghua, Director of the Guangxi Pacification Headquarters stationed in Guangdong, on the 24th, authorizing 3,000 yuan to cover Wu's funeral expenses and dispatching personnel to assist with the post-mortem affairs. The telegram stated, "(Above omitted) Dr. Wu Bofan tragically lost his life in a plane crash en route to Guangxi. The nation's reconstruction has lost a talented individual, deeply regrettable. Please, Brother Huaizhou (Kan Zonghua), immediately allocate 3,000 yuan for Dr. Wu's funeral expenses and dispatch personnel to assist with all arrangements to comfort his spirit. Regarding condolence matters, please verify his qualifications and consult with Brother Xiang Molin (Hanping), so that Guangdong and Guangxi can jointly petition the central government to show the utmost respect and consideration for the virtuous. Zongren respectfully (24th) stamped." From this, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities' respect for this scholar and consultant to the Shaanxi government is evident. The "Chang Geng" aircraft, salvaged from the river, was transported back to Guangzhou by small boat on the 26th and towed to the Shipai airfield for repairs. It is reported that the damage was not severe, and the aircraft should be able to resume flying after repairs.

### Jia Ding Bandit Den, Little Liangshan, Burned Down

Little Liangshan is a village in Zhuzhai Township, the second district of the county, with more than 40 households, most of whom are thieves. It is named after Liangshanbo from the Water Margin. The original village name is no longer used. Their thievery is organized, with Xu Aliang as the leader. They use the proceeds to hire Tao as a legal advisor. Nearby people know their activities but are afraid to speak out. They travel in groups at night, and people avoid them for fear of their ferocity. Their history goes back decades. But the local government has never paid attention because it is remote and news doesn't spread. On February 9th, they went to Bo Aliu's house near Panlong, Qingpu, to steal. The bandit Yang Er crawled into the hole. Bo sensed this and prepared a sharp blade. When Yang was halfway out of the hole, Bo stabbed him. Yang cried out. The other bandits broke down the door. Bo fought back but was outnumbered. Yang was seriously wounded in the stomach. The other bandits carried him back, leaving a trail of blood. He died when he arrived home. The bandits secretly buried him to hide their crime. On the 10th, Bo Aliu reported to the Qingpu police, and the Qingpu Huangdu and Xu Jing police squads went together to Little Liangshan to investigate. They arrested eight men and one woman and recovered a lot of stolen goods. They were all sent to the Qingpu county government for interrogation. The woman arrested was Yang Er's wife. She confessed and they recovered Yang's body. The township head reported to the county government, which sent an official to verify the body on the 11th. After the raid, the bandits hid. Many people went to see the bandit den and were outraged to see the stolen goods. They burned 30 tile-roofed houses and damaged 20 more. The Nanxiang police squad came to suppress the crowd and restore order. It is rumored that the bandits are using their money to lobby officials in Nanxiang and Jiwang to resolve the matter. County Chief Guo thought the matter was serious because it involves Qingpu County and Shanghai, and is consulting with the other governments to decide how to handle it.

### The "Hujing" Ferryboat Sinks in Suzhou Lake

The "Hujing" ferryboat, owned by the Shanghai Zhengchang Shipping Company, departed from Shanghai with dozens of passengers and a large quantity of goods on the afternoon of the 4th, heading directly to Huzhou. At 4 a.m. on the 5th, while still dark, the ferryboat arrived at the Chenwang Township police station on the river under the jurisdiction of Wujiang County. While passing through the Ande Bridge and making a turn, the bottom of the boat struck the bridge stone, causing significant damage. After sailing about 50 or 60 feet from the bridge, the crew realized that the boat was rapidly sinking due to a severe leak in the hull. They quickly steered towards the shore. Passengers scrambled to escape, creating chaos. Simultaneously, the ferryboat gradually sank. After about 20 minutes, the ferryboat was submerged. Fortunately, all the passengers escaped, but most of the cargo could not be salvaged. Afterwards, the head engineer, Zhao Abing, returned to Shanghai to report to the company and arrange for salvage operations.

### Suspicious Death of a County Middle School Student

Hu Bangduo, an 18-year-old student at the Canglangting Wuxian County Middle School from Hunan Province, complained of fever at 3 p.m. on the 4th during class, and returned to the dormitory to rest. At 9 p.m., he suddenly experienced severe vomiting and diarrhea. The school doctor, Cao Zhongwen, diagnosed acute gastroenteritis and prescribed medication. Unexpectedly, he died at 5 a.m. on the 5th. The school authorities notified the student's father, Hu Tingsheng, who traveled from Dongting East Mountain to the school. Upon seeing his son's corpse with a purplish complexion, and learning about the course of his illness, he confronted the school principal, Cao Deyue, alleging that his son died only ten-odd hours after becoming ill, and the corpse was feverish, implying that the death was caused by incorrect medication. The school doctor claimed the corpse was purple because of the high fever near death caused blood vessel to burst. The two parties are currently in negotiation. The court was notified and went to examine the body at 4 p.m.

### Changshu Embezzlement Case Dismissed

The embezzlement case involving Zhang Changqi, a second-level clerk and land tax commissioner in the county government, has attracted the attention of the local residents. It is reported that the county government, which also handles judicial matters, has dismissed the case and archived it. The embezzled funds of 1,000 yuan have also been returned. Zhang left Changshu three days ago. The people are suspicious of Zhang, as he is a clerk with limited income. How could he have remitted such a large sum of money to his hometown in just a few months? Even if it were his private property, why would he secretly go to Suzhou to remit it? The various organizations have telegraphed County Chief Chen, pointing out that he concurrently handles judicial matters and should recuse himself due to his subordinate's involvement. However, Chen did not take any action. Now, at the conclusion of the county's judicial proceedings, before the court is established, he ordered the presiding officer to make this judgment, which is causing dissatisfaction among the people.

### Changzhou Minfeng Factory Strike in Stalemate

The strike by female workers at the Minfeng Yarn Factory has been through multiple disturbances, with the destruction of objects in the machine room meeting room and other places. Xu Baoguang, head of the city police station, and Jiang Dingsheng, director of the general labor union preparation, serve as mediators. The female workers put forward seven requests. The factory agreed to study them, and will give a reply on the 4th. The factory was peaceful from the night of the 3rd to the morning of the 4th. On the afternoon of the 4th, the female workers went to the county party headquarters to listen to the news. But they didn't get results. Most of the female workers went back to the factory and caused trouble. Some held up chamber pots and brooms and danced. Some threw bricks at the wall. The factory said that the workers interfering with the students of the training class was a matter of personnel administration, and workers do not have the right to interfere. It insisted on the principle of unconditional resumption of work. Xu Baoguang went to the county government to consult with Secretary Huang Xianzeng, who consulted with the second district commissioner. At 9 PM, Jiang Dingsheng went to the factory to solicit opinions. The female workers seemed to be making concessions. They said that the students in the training class should not interfere with workers' jobs, and some machines should be allocated to the students in the training class. Wages should be increased pending a review by an arbitration committee. Chen Yuchuan and Sun Jinsheng should be transferred to other positions. Jiang Dingsheng consulted with the factory. The factory agreed to consult and reply on the morning of the 5th.

### Zhenjiang Business Tax Difficult to Cancel

At the recent conference of the Jiangsu Provincial Businessmen's Federation, the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce proposed that, given the Ministry of Finance's implementation of income tax collection, in order to reduce the burden on businesses and residents, the conference should petition for the cancellation of the business tax bureau. However, according to officials from the Department of Finance, the Federation's suggestion was made directly to the Ministry of Finance, and the department had not received any formal document. The department did not want to express any opinion on this matter. Objectively speaking, it is unlikely that this request will be granted. It should be noted that income tax is a national revenue, while business tax is a provincial revenue. In terms of principles, they do not conflict. The business tax has become increasingly standardized in recent years, with tax revenues increasing. The future of business taxation is unlimited. The Business Tax Law was approved by the Legislative Yuan and approved by the Executive Yuan and is a legitimate tax revenue. It cannot be easily changed.

### Nantong Large Batch of Drug Offenders Sentenced to Death

County Chief Hong has prepared all the case files and submitted them to the provincial government for review.

### Sanmen Bay Development Plan

The provincial government attaches great importance to the development of Sanmen Bay and has instructed the Construction Department to develop a detailed plan. Construction of highways near Sanmen Bay will be prioritized to facilitate transportation. The development of Sanmen Bay will require significant funds. It is rumored that the authorities have made considerable plans to partially collect fees from the benefited farmland to compensate for the shortfall. The estimated cost for harbor construction is around one million yuan. In addition to the revenue collected from benefited farmland, the remainder will be included in next year's budgetary appropriations.

### Today's Group A Soccer: Donghua Faces Laurel Again

Matches at Shenyuan Stadium at 3:00 PM; Jinan vs. Western Police at Jiaozhou Garden

Today's Western Union soccer schedule includes four Group A matches. The outcomes of the French Business vs. Portuguese, Lax vs. Western Business, and Western Police vs. Jinan matches are relatively predictable. The Donghua vs. Laurel match is of greatest interest. In the first round-robin, Donghua defeated the British Army 4-0. Today, the situation has changed dramatically. Laurel is at its peak, with the god of victory favoring the British Army, which can be foreseen. The roster for tomorrow's International Cup semi-final match will be determined after today's Donghua match, according to manager Yu Hengzhi. About 70% of the Chinese representatives are from Donghua. Therefore, the intense battle today will impact tomorrow's International Cup. Fortunately, yesterday was rainy, and it is uncertain whether today's matches will be played, depending on the weather and field conditions. Hopefully, the postponement will preserve strength for tomorrow's International Cup semi-final. Today's Schedule French Business vs. Portuguese (Group A) Yiyuan, He Chunhui Lax vs. Western Business (Group A) Hongkou, San Laurel vs. Donghua (Group A) Shenyuan, Marshall, Linesmen Zhang Le, Maiqidi Jinan vs. Western Police (Group A) Jiaozhou Garden

### Ten Teams Already Registered for Jiangwan Group Cross-Country Race

Registration Deadline: 14th

The annual public international Jiangwan group cross-country championship, organized by the Westerners' Athletic Association, will be held on the 21st of this month (Sunday). According to the association's secretary, Wei Dejun, ten teams have already registered, including the Chinese Police Team, the French Army, the British Army, Laurel, and two mixed teams organized by the association, as well as the Hongkou and Yibing teams. The two Chinese teams will register after their selection. As the race date is approaching, the registration deadline is set for the 14th of this month. Those who wish to participate but have not yet registered can contact Wei Dejun at the General Transportation Office of the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road. The association stated that, in accordance with British cross-country race rules, this year will feature teams of ten, with the scores of the first eight finishers counted, doubling the number of counted finishers from the past. Therefore, the number of prizes has also increased. However, the prizes committee believes that prizes should represent honor and should be made of silver, steel, bronze, or antimony to symbolize permanence, rather than the currently popular silver shields and cups. Athletes endure much hardship and expend much sweat and blood during training. If the association were to provide imitation products that would fade with time, it would be equivalent to temporary deception, which is regrettable and contradicts the purpose of promotion. Therefore, the prizes for the top ten finishers this year will be especially rich. In addition to the prizes provided by the association, the Continental Daily, Mr. Littell, Mr. Kangtian De, the American Express Bank, and the Yizhong Tobacco Company have donated many silver cups and shields. There are also no fewer than ten other companies and individuals who have pledged donations but have not yet delivered them. These prizes are planned to be displayed at a certain company within days, and negotiations are still underway. The association's tenth practice session is scheduled for tomorrow morning at 10:30 AM, starting from the west gate of Hongkou Park, with a total distance of six miles. All Chinese and Western teams are expected to arrive on time.

In the last race walk, Xie Xingdao finished the 10,000 meters in 51 minutes and 28.4 seconds, winning first place, but was disqualified due to incorrect posture, and Zhou Ruquan won the championship.

### Promoting Labor Affairs at the Chinese Vocational Education Society

In Collaboration with Shenxin Textile Mill No. 3, Establishing a Labor Autonomy Experimental Zone

Since the Chinese Vocational Education Society began promoting labor affairs, using the labor autonomy zone of Shenxin Textile Mill No. 3 in Wuxi as an experimental site, progress has been rapid. The latest situation is detailed below for the reference of those concerned with labor education.

Zonal Organization

The entire area is divided into four major zones: the single female workers' zone, the single male workers' zone, the staff and family zone, and the workers' family zone, totaling fifteen villages with 3,130 people. In the future, it is planned to fully develop the workers' family zone and engage in the organization of an "Anle New Village" (Peace and Happiness New Village), to achieve the goal of ruralizing the factory and turning the zone's residents into farmers.

Educational Situation

Currently, there are two levels of nurseries, accommodating 48 children; primary school-level students number 215; and there are 18 literacy classes with 795 students. Twelve classes in rabbit raising, chicken raising, mink raising, photography, sewing, and car driving have graduated 695 students. There are 115 female worker training school students and 12 machine worker training school students. There are 157 primary school teachers of all levels, over 580 books, and two kinds of publications, including "Shenxin News."

Sanitary Facilities

A new Western-style employee hospital building was constructed, costing 4,100 yuan. In addition, X-ray and surgical blood testing equipment were added, valued at over 10,000 yuan. This year, 1,728 employees have been treated by Western medicine and 435 by traditional Chinese medicine (starting in August). There are five bathhouses, able to accommodate 120 people simultaneously.

Employee Life

Usually, great attention is paid to imparting life skills and knowledge to employees, such as promoting rural side occupations and teaching practical skills, to ensure they possess a skill that can be applied. Employee efficiency has greatly improved, and the spirit of happy work is especially rich. In addition, collective organization and entertainment activities are also vigorously promoted. This year, a new auditorium was built, accommodating over 400 people, for residents to use for centralized training, meetings, lectures, and entertainment in their spare time. Radio equipment has been installed. This year, there was one Peking opera performance, two movie screenings, and three theatrical performances. Four tour groups were organized. At the same time, particular attention is paid to instilling and promoting the national spirit. A Zunxian Hall (Hall of Honoring the Virtuous) has been established, with statues of Yue Fei and Qi Jiguang enshrined in the center, for reverence.

### Middle School Graduation Examination Questions (2)

— Ying

Looking at the changes to the graduation examination procedures, the number of subjects has been reduced several times, now down to five, about half of what it used to be. Before the graduation examination, schools no longer hold graduation exams, only semester exams. The total score of the school is based on the semester exams. The content of the semester exams only includes the material of the last semester. This is clearly different from graduation exams, which cover all subjects learned in the three years. Although the scope of each graduation examination subject is also the entire three-year curriculum, only subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, and geography have substantial content. Chinese and foreign languages are symbolic subjects, relying on gradual cultivation rather than rote memorization. If school graduation exams were held instead of graduation examinations, junior high school would require exams in civics, manual labor, music, and other subjects covering the entire curriculum. Subjects such as physiology, hygiene, botany, and zoology, whose courses ended earlier, would require re-examination of the entire curriculum. Senior high school would require exams in physical education, music, and other subjects covering the entire curriculum. Subjects such as civics, ethics, and biology, whose courses ended earlier, would require re-examination of the entire curriculum. Furthermore, the graduation examination procedures combine physics and chemistry, and history and geography, into single subjects, which differs significantly in weight and difficulty from the graduation exams where each subject is a separate unit. Therefore, the burden on students from internal graduation examinations, where some subjects only require examination of the last semester's coursework, some are exempt from exams having ended earlier, and some combine two subjects into one unit, is much lighter than that of school graduation exams. Regarding the acceptance of students who fail one or two subjects in the graduation examination, the remedies for those who still fail after supplementary exams, and the calculation of graduation scores, all have been repeatedly improved. It is also estimated that there are many drawbacks in using the graduation examination to estimate school performance. The most prominent is that poorly managed schools neglect discipline and instruction, resulting in a large number of students held back temporarily to reduce the percentage of failing students and the ratio of participants in the graduation examination, which greatly harms young people. The changed procedures have already deleted this.

If the graduation examination is merely harmless, there would be no point in taking this extra step. However, we seek to make it beneficial. What is the benefit? To standardize the graduation level of middle school students and increase teaching efficiency. Although the middle school curriculum standards were promulgated after 1929, schools still use different textbooks. Since the graduation examination is implemented, questions must be based on the standard scope, so schools have no choice but to strictly follow the standards and use approved textbooks. The situation of using a variety of standards has changed greatly. As for the teaching situation of each subject reflected in the results of the graduation examination, the best subjects in senior high school in 1932 were Chinese language and party principles, and in junior high school were party principles, Chinese language, and geography. In 1933, the best subjects in senior high school were geography, party principles, and Chinese language, and in junior high school were party principles and history and geography. In 1934, the best subjects in senior high school were party principles, Chinese language, history, and geography, and in junior high school were party principles, Chinese language, physical science, chemistry, history, and geography. The worst subjects in senior high school in 1932 were mathematics and foreign languages, and in junior high school were mathematics, natural science, and foreign languages. In 1933, the worst subjects in senior high school were mathematics, foreign languages, and physics, and in junior high school were foreign languages, mathematics, and Chinese language. In 1934, the worst subjects in senior high school were mathematics and foreign languages, and in junior high school were foreign languages, physical science, chemistry, and mathematics. Generally speaking over three years, the better subjects for both senior and junior high school were party principles and Chinese, with history and geography next, and the worst subjects were foreign languages, mathematics, physical science, chemistry, and natural science. In view of these major defects, three things have been done to seek remedies. First, the curriculum standards have been revised. Senior high school mathematics has been divided into groups for teaching from the second year. Group A has more time than before, and the curriculum content remains unchanged. Group B has less time, and the content and level are also reduced, so that students can choose to study according to their personality and obtain a solid understanding. Second, teacher training is being vigorously promoted. Summer training courses have been held for three consecutive years, with special emphasis on mathematics and science. The training and selection methods are becoming more strict. Third, scientific instruments are being manufactured. Since 1935, the Ministry of Education, jointly with the Board of Trustees for the British Boxer Indemnity Fund and the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, has allocated funds and entrusted the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica to manufacture domestic scientific instruments according to the standards for physics and chemistry equipment for senior and junior high schools promulgated by the Ministry, and to sell them to middle schools across the country at reduced prices. This year, this plan will be expanded in scope and continued. In the future, all schools must have this standard equipment to increase the efficiency of science teaching. All of these are matters that should be done to improve middle school education, but with the reference of the results of the graduation examination, the order of priority becomes clearer. In short, although it is not easy to see the effect of standardizing the graduation level of middle school students and improving teaching efficiency through the graduation examination, it is a clear fact that teachers and students in schools have been working hard on their studies, eliminating the past abuses of perfunctory and superficial work. Following this trend, it can be said that the knowledge education of middle school students will gradually become more solid, and the level of graduation will gradually become more standardized. The fact that young people's actions tend to be more regular and the academic atmosphere is becoming more serious because of their efforts in their studies is a side effect of the graduation examination system, and not its main goal. Some say that "the graduation examination system is to urge students to study books, increase their workload, and shift their attention away from the country and society, thereby eliminating student unrest," which is a biased view and a misunderstanding. Even in terms of eliminating student unrest, it is a reverse inference.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Prices Relatively Firm Recently

### Securities, Public Debt Longs and Shorts Both Have Concerns

Yesterday, the public debt market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange became increasingly dull in the midst of spinning, because the long and short sides were facing each other, and market sentiment also turned sluggish. The long side was firm because the price was expensive and there was a lack of progress, and the shorts were抛空because the market situation was易变and they also少把握. Big clients have gradually been出笼, 市价疲跌.Yesterday morning, the long散户卖散户卖渐已卖已出售, 四十七号号抛卖亦殷. 市价一致下疲五分一角一角.三十六号则收买颇涌涌, 甲种五十四号拥有拥有筹码供出.跌略一二角.角. 次盘筹码供出仍极涌跃.五•四十三号等

### Compilation Method for Income Tax Return Forms (3)

(1) Business Report Form (Continued)
— Pan Shih-hao

Branch stores established by a partnership, with capital allocated from the head office, can also fill in the position of operating capital. Or, when the head office files this form, intending to separately report the income of the branches, the remaining amount after deducting the allocated capital to the branches from the actual amount of the share capital should be filled in the operating capital position. If the branch stores are filing this form and have no allocated capital, they can indicate "Capital at the Head Office" in the operating capital position. The operating capital or actual amount of share capital filled in this form should be the same as the capital or share capital recorded in the transcription book and reported when registering the business. If a partnership has a written agreement, the records of capital or share capital in the books should also be consistent with the agreement. Accumulated surplus and profits that have not been formally transferred to capital or share capital should not be included. If it is necessary to report the accumulated surplus, it can be filled in the remarks section. In fact, according to the current laws on income tax, if accumulated surplus is not converted into capital or share capital, one-third of it cannot be added to the capital calculation as a basis for calculating the income tax rate. Article 5 of the Draft Notice on the Collection of Income Tax for Category 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprises stipulates that the one-third addition of accumulated surplus to capital calculation is limited to the accumulated surplus stipulated by laws and regulations. The so-called accumulated surplus stipulated by laws and regulations is actually the accumulated surplus stipulated for limited companies in Article 170 of the Company Law. Accumulated surplus withdrawn by individual proprietorships or partnerships is not the accumulated surplus stipulated by laws and regulations. The main reason why businesses cannot file the business report form on time is the inability to determine the capital amount. According to the current income tax laws, the income tax for profit-seeking enterprises is calculated by first figuring out what percentage of the actual capital amount the income is, and then using progressive tax rates to calculate the tax payable. The larger the capital of the same profit-making business, the smaller the tax rate. This concept has been deeply ingrained in most businesses. However, most of China's bookkeeping methods have not been improved. The calculation of the actual capital amount is simplified, lacking comprehensiveness. Some businesses initially invested several thousand yuan in capital, but now their net assets reach several hundred thousand yuan, while the capital amount on the books is still recorded as several thousand yuan. Others have large-scale operations and complex asset structures, but have no capital recorded on the books. As a result, it takes a long time to organize and verify, and the business report is delayed. In reality, the matters declared in this form can be changed in the future. If there is already a record of capital in the books, or the capital amount has already been partially agreed upon by shareholders, regardless of the written amount, it can be filed first. When a complete verification is calculated in the future, another change can be filed. It is also permissible if the declared amount temporarily does not match the business registration and partnership agreement. The business registration can be changed. The partnership agreement can be revised or a new share receipt can be created. (To be continued)

Women's Special

### The New Tasks of Women Today

— Jin Sheng

The cries for "women's liberation" and "gender equality" are rising day by day during this extraordinary period. On the surface, this is undoubtedly a sign of progress. However, upon closer observation, we feel greatly disappointed! Because some women today, on the one hand, are shouting for "gender equality," while on the other hand, they willingly "become playthings for men." On the one hand, they are shouting for "women's liberation," while on the other hand, they are adding "limitless constraints" to themselves. Know that women seeking "true liberation" and "true equality" cannot achieve results by empty talk but by practical action. The essentials of how to take practical action are listed below:

1.  The Beauty of Knowledge: Knowledge is the foundation of life. A person without knowledge is like a soulless shell, lacking thought. They rely on others in everything and can hardly get rid of this bad habit no matter the time or place. If the object of reliance disappears or dies, they will likely wander around and feel pain everywhere. Therefore, to seek liberation, one must not have a dependent mind. To avoid dependence, one must first have an independent spirit and sufficient intelligence. Thus, we must strive for our studies, enrich our knowledge, and especially during this extraordinary period, we must strive for daily progress and beautify our knowledge to become women of the times.

2.  The Beauty of Health: To have sound knowledge, one must first have a healthy body. To have a healthy body, one must have proper exercise. With a healthy body, one can endure hardship. With the ability to endure hardship, one has the power to work. With the power to work, one need not worry about "gender inequality" or "women's liberation."

3.  The Beauty of Morality: Having a healthy physique and full knowledge, but lacking beautiful morality, the spirit and knowledge can instead help them to do evil. For example, seeing others wearing gorgeous clothes and living comfortably, a woman without morality will feel envious. Once tempted, she will easily fall. How can such a woman lacking morality talk about true equality? Therefore, every woman must respect her own morality and recognize her own responsibilities. If she achieves this, her heart will be calm and without regrets. In this way, she will obtain true equality without seeking it, and even men who play with women will respect her!

The love of beauty is inherent in everyone, especially women. The beauty we need is like hunger seeking food and thirst seeking drink. However, the beauty we need is not superficial but internal. Superficial beauty is temporary, while internal beauty is permanent. Who doesn't love a beautiful face, but faces age quickly? Who doesn't love a beautiful voice, but voices change soon? These are all superficial beauties that cannot last.

Women, if we can achieve the above three points, why worry that others will not give us due sympathy?

### Brief Biography of Clara Zetkin, Founder of International Women's Day (1857-1933)

— Jun Peng

— Written before "March 8th" —

International Women's Day is a memorial day for women to fight for independent personalities from the shackles of the old feudal ethics. It is also the most glorious page for women to seek liberation. Therefore, every year on "March 8th," women in countries around the world hold enthusiastic commemorative meetings. This is such a happy festival for us! Sisters who have already been liberated are naturally very joyful. Everyone dances, sings, talks, and says. But looking back at Chinese women, because of the poisoning of feudal society, there are still many sisters who are living "inhuman lives." What a heartbreaking thing! I hope everyone will follow in the bloodstained footsteps of the past struggles and work hard! Work hard to move forward! Only then will we be worthy of Ms. Clara Zetkin, who leads us. Now, I might as well introduce her brief biography to you.

Ms. Clara Zetkin was born in 1857 in Niederrad, Germany. Her father was a primary school teacher. The family style was simple, and she lived in pure nature. At the age of twenty, she left home and entered the Leipzig Normal School. At that time, Germany was gradually developing its national strength, and capitalism was gradually maturing. The conflict between labor and capital was also gradually growing. At this time, Ms. Clara met many exiles from Russia and Poland and joined the Social Democratic Party. Soon, she met the Russian exiled revolutionary Osip Zetkin. In 1878, the German government promulgated the "Anti-Socialist Law." Anyone suspected of believing in socialism was arrested, and Osip Zetkin was also deported. Therefore, Ms. Clara followed Osip and left her motherland of Germany. In 1880, the two lived together in Switzerland. Soon, they went to Paris, France. Later, Osip suffered from an incurable serious illness. For the sake of her sick husband and two children, she had to teach, translate, or write to maintain their lives. Thus, she tasted the pain of being displaced in a foreign land and also suffered the material pain of revolutionaries. This pain may have led her to fight for the oppressed.

In 1889, Osip passed away. At that time, the German "Anti-Socialist Law" had been abolished. Clara took her children and returned to her homeland. Soon, she joined the Social Democratic Party of Stuttgart. In 1892, she edited the "Equality Women's Magazine" and devoted herself to the women's liberation movement, seeking benefits for working women. Her remarks received sympathy and support from many people. She supported this editor's position for as long as thirteen years. She clarified the differences between the bourgeois women's movement and the working-class women's movement. Moreover, she organized many women's groups and engaged in the women's public. The real famous "Bain Declaration" opposed the most cruel war for the benefit of a few people. Therefore, she ate several months of lawsuits, but this punishment strengthened her will to oppose. In July of the same year, she founded the "International Magazine." In 1907, at her suggestion, an international women's socialist secretariat was established at the International Socialist Women's Congress, and she was appointed as secretary. The International Women's Association was established on March 8, 1907, and it was decided that this day would be "International Women's Day." This is the origin of the "March 8th" Festival. Perhaps you don't know it!

In 1917, the Russian Revolution broke out. She worked hard to promote the Russian Revolution. At that time, she had been elected as the first member of the German parliament. When she first took the stage to speak, she boldly expressed her support for the Soviet Union. Her eloquent and great remarks shook the entire audience. In 1920, she stepped into the Soviet Union she had been looking forward to. At this time, the Soviet Union was holding the Ninth Congress. When she walked into the "Sverdlov" Hall of the Kremlin Palace, there was a thunderous applause, and the crowd warmly welcomed her. In 1933, at the International Anti-War Conference held in Amsterdam, she used various means from all aspects to oppose the necessity of World War II. "Opposing war is opposing the aggressors of imperialism." This was her only slogan. In the same year, she returned to Germany once and used her highly respected qualifications to deliver a closing speech in the German Parliament. Later, she went to Moscow, the capital of Russia, and soon fell asleep there, at the age of seventy-six. Hundreds of thousands of people attended the funeral. People like Stalin and Molotov, important figures in Russia, personally helped with the coffin and buried the learned and talented world female revolutionary after Lenin's tomb. It was truly the ultimate posthumous glory.

From the above brief biography, we can see that she is the savior of women all over the world. Now that she is dead, but we have sought liberation from shackles and obtained an equal status. She is indeed our only leader. Therefore, we should continue to fight to rescue many pitiful female compatriots from the "inhuman life" of deep water and fire, so that she can also get some comfort! Her lifetime works include "Luxembourg and the Russian Revolution," "Women's Labor in Modern Women's Issues," "Women's Suffrage Issues," "The Origin of the Proletarian Women's Movement," and "Remembering Lenin." Dear female compatriots! The day after tomorrow is the "March 8th" anniversary. Please don't forget Ms. Clara Zetkin, who has worked hard!

### When the Plum Blossoms Bloom

— You Lan

Spring has come, and the first happy thing is the blooming of those plum blossoms with their subtle fragrance and sparse shadows. Xu Chu once said very triumphantly: "After I die, I would like to be buried under any plum tree." This also shows how deep his love for plum blossoms is.

During a season when plum blossoms were in full bloom, I arranged with Xu Chu to go to Guangfu, Suzhou for a two or three-day vacation. We originally said that the two of us would go, but when I arrived at the station, I saw that Xu Chu had brought a woman with him. Although this situation was abrupt, in this era, it was of course unnecessary for me to be surprised. So the three of us got on the train together. After returning to our seats, Xu Chu couldn't help but introduce her to me: "This is Ms. Xu Xinying. You often watch Chinese movies, so I think you've heard her name before, right?" Ah! No wonder she looks so familiar, she's a rising star in the film industry.

Ms. Xu's true appearance is actually even more beautiful than on the screen. Unfortunately, I am the worst at describing a woman's appearance. I only know who is ugly and who is beautiful, but I can't describe it at all. Of course! Ms. Xu belongs to the beautiful category, and is always among the best in the beautiful category. As for how Xu Chu got to know her, and even managed to invite her to be a travel companion, not only did I not know at the time, but I'm still very vague about it even now!

But the scene of the two of them that day really made me feel excited. Xu Chu was so enthusiastically entangled with her, and she was also as tender as water, relying on Xu Chu. I once secretly spied on them kissing six or seven times in the plum grove, and one time the time was about five minutes or more. When we came back, Xu Chu's clothes were still inserted with that small branch of green plum that Ms. Xu had picked for him, and he cherished it as much as the Jiahe Medal and Caiyu Medal.

After that, we didn't see each other for a long time. No, we did see each other, but we were all in a hurry and didn't have a chance to say a few words, which was almost the same as not seeing each other. In this way, two years passed without realizing it, and in a blink of an eye, it was the plum blossom season again. I suddenly had the urge to travel and wanted to go to Chao Mountain for a walk. Because I knew that Xu Chu had the deepest love for plum blossoms, I called him a few days in advance to invite him. Unexpectedly, he was not in the office. When I asked about his home again, they said that he had also moved away. Of course, I was very surprised. I hurried to inquire carefully and found out that he had been splashed with lime bags because of his love affair with Ms. Xu, and both of his eyes were blinded. The matter could not be handled anymore, so he had to return to his hometown in frustration. And Ms. Xu? Who can force her to return to her hometown with Xu Chu!

This news completely broke my interest in exploring plum blossoms.

### Sixth Letter

— (Zhuo Dai)

Ms. B:

The question you asked in your letter: "Why have gardens in Shanghai been built by the Japanese in recent years?" This is a question worth studying.

Now, the styles of Jin Diqiu Garden can be roughly divided into three schools: the European and American countries, which become one school, China, which also forms its own school, and Japan, which is another school. For the convenience of the architects, the first school of European and American style gardens is called the Formal style, also called the Geometric style, and also called the Pattern style. Because not only the layout of their gardens is square, but even a tree is often cut into a square shape. The Japanese style is exactly the opposite, called the Natural style, and everything imitates nature. Our Chinese gardens are called Pictorial style, which is neither like the Formal style, creating any pattern on an open space, nor does it absolutely imitate nature. It is completely like Chinese painting. If the three are all compared to painting, then the European and American style is instrumental painting, the Japanese style is sketching, and the Chinese style is Chinese painting. However, like sketching, it is not completely sketching.

Chinese gardens have many buildings made of wood, such as towers, pavilions, and terraces, which are often arranged densely, and there are not many open-air places. This is completely contrary to the purpose of modern gardening. The European and American and Japanese styles have very few buildings, most of which are outdoors, which meets modern needs a lot. Moreover, the more buildings there are, the more expensive it becomes.

Therefore, Chinese people build gardens in recent years. First, because of the trend of the times, they do not like to be confined indoors. Second, because of economic reasons, they do not plan to have towers, pavilions, and terraces. Third, they are a little tired of the old-fashioned gardens, so they have to change a direction and adopt some foreign interests. The first thing that Chinese people came into contact with was of course the European and American style gardens in Shanghai and other places; however, this patterned thing is suitable for parks. If private gardens also imitate this style, not only does the area need to be very large, but it cannot arouse the interest of the Chinese people. It is inevitable to feel monotonous.

It is better to have a Japanese-style garden, which is easy to look at. On the one hand, there are more elements of oriental interest, and on the other hand, even if the location is extremely small, it can be arranged well. Third, the materials and labor are very cheap. (Although some are also very expensive, it is possible to find a way to make it cheaper.) Because of various reasons, many private gardens in Shanghai are built by the Japanese. I have also visited four or five places in Shanghai. The garden of Mr. Cheng Linsheng on Xujiahui Road (it seems to be called Suiwulu?) is also completely in Japanese style. Although the area is not large, it is very tortuous. Unfortunately, it has not been repaired recently, and the trees have also withered because a factory in the beach dumped hydrochloric acid.

However, the Japanese who arrange gardens for people in Shanghai are not really garden experts, but just some flower and tree craftsmen who also serve in this position. It is rare to have one or two garden designers among them. This garden designer is almost like a house-building foreman. He can contract the construction; but sometimes he often boldly designs for people, but these people's designs are always inevitably a bit tacky, and there will be unreasonable places. For example, it is too bad to decorate a purely Japanese-style stone lantern in a Chinese garden; if you want him to think of something to replace it, he does not have this ability. Madam! Next time, I will talk to you about the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the three styles. Goodbye.

Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided, Ye Zhizhong recorded, and after the ceremony, the chairman gave the opening remarks, followed by reports from the standing committee member Ke Ganchen and secretary Yan Ese of the Chamber. Next, Liang Hejun, director of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, delivered a speech. Finally, Huang Yisheng, Tang Wenji, and Yan Ese answered over 50 questions raised by the representatives. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The details are recorded below.

Chairman's Address

Chairman Wang Xiaolai said in his address: "Representatives, the purpose of convening this meeting today is to explain the meaning of declaring capital for income tax purposes. Originally, the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the declaration period should be the end of January. However, as various businesses had not yet completed their annual financial closing at that time, the Chamber negotiated an extension to the end of February. However, the end of February is only half a month away from the financial closing. Given the large number of merchants in Shanghai, many had not yet received the declaration forms during this period, and some businesses did not understand the meaning of declaring capital and were unable to complete the process in time. Therefore, when the deadline arrived at the end of the month, many businesses had not yet reported. In fact, it was necessary to continue the extension. The Chamber believes that declaring capital is the first step in handling income tax and is also the most complicated. Since this first step is not clear, the Chamber believes it is necessary to provide an explanation. The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance also shared this sentiment, and therefore scheduled today's meeting. The points that should be explained are as follows: ⑴ The necessity of declaring capital or share capital: Profit income tax is levied on capital of 2,000 yuan or more. Therefore, if the capital is less than this amount, those who are exempt from income tax according to the regulations should report it, otherwise there will be no basis for exemption in the future. Those with capital of more than 1,000 yuan will need to use this to calculate the ratio of profit to capital to determine the tax bracket. If it is not listed and reported, there will be no way to classify it in the future. Therefore, this is the first step in handling income tax. ⑵ The amount of capital declared in form A is different from the amount of income declared: Businesses have two misunderstandings about this: ⑴ They believe that the business year is from the end of May each year to the end of June of the following year. ⑵ They say that the business has peak months and off-peak months, and the current value is an off-peak month, which is no different from a business shutdown. Therefore, based on the above two reasons, they requested another extension. In fact, although the business is suspended, the capital is fixed. The business outlook is the key to calculating the business income. Declaring capital only needs to be based on the current capital, without considering the profits and losses after the end of the year. In short, "business boom and bust" and "the business year has not yet ended" all relate to the scope of declaring income. We are not talking about this now. The declaration of income must be made within three months after the end of the Dingchou year, according to Article 8 of the regulations. Now we only report capital, and we don’t need to discuss this together. ⑶ Capital is different from assets: In addition, many businesses say that it is impossible to complete the inventory of goods and estimate the property in a short time and request an extension, which all fall within the scope of assets. In the future, when declaring income, it may be necessary to submit a balance sheet for verification. Now we only report capital, and we do not need to check the property and inventory. ⑷ Moreover, some businesses say that they are old stores for many years, and the capital cannot be determined. This is not entirely true. If the industrial and commercial enterprise is a company organization, the amount of share capital must be stated in the articles of association and share book or its registration license. If there has been no capital increase or decrease from the beginning, it shall be reported according to the share capital at the beginning. If the share capital has subsequently increased or decreased, it shall be reported according to the actual amount after the increase or decrease of the share capital. If it is a partnership organization, it must also be stated on the agreement and the ten thousand gold book. If it is a sole proprietorship, the amount of capital invested when it was opened must also be stated in the account book, so that there is no way to verify it. In addition, there is a sole proprietorship that has not invested capital by itself, but is overdrafting from the bank at any time for turnover. It should be reported according to the actual amount of capital borrowed, based on the average of the maximum amount and the minimum amount. ⑸ Some say that the entire reserve fund is included in the calculation of capital, and it cannot be determined, so it can only be temporarily postponed. This can be explained in two levels: (1) Capital increase is the freedom of the merchant, and the law does not interfere. If the business is anxious to solve this problem, it can use the capital increase procedure to convert the reserve into capital. At this time, it is not impossible to include it in the table first. (2) If one party is included in the capital calculation, and the other party still wants to retain the name of the reserve fund, you can do the supplementary reporting procedure separately. The above sections are a brief explanation of what I have seen. Today, there are representatives from the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance present. If you have any questions, you can ask them face to face for instructions."

Ke Yan's Report

Next, Ke Ganchen, a standing committee member of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, reported, "Income tax is a complicated tax system. In this initial stage, we taxpayers all feel the pain of being at a loss. However, this new tax system is a good tax for self-reliance and national revival. Our people should of course do their best to support and promote it. As a Shanghai merchant group, the Chamber should lead the city's merchants to fulfill the obligation of implementing this good tax. Therefore, not long ago, a series of income tax lectures and research conferences were held. Later, we invited famous scholars and experts in the city to form a special committee, which held more than ten meetings before and after, and thoroughly studied the various collection guidelines and implementation rules, contributed opinions, and requested the tax authorities to adopt them separately to modify the legal terms that were not suitable for business conditions, so as to promote the implementation without obstacles and not to be harsh. We also added income tax training courses and improved Chinese bookkeeping classes to the commercial supplementary school and the Nanshi commercial vocational school affiliated to the Chamber, so that merchants can study. The meaning of convening this meeting today has already been reported by Chairman Wang. It is to make everyone understand how to declare capital, etc. Today, Director Liang of the Shanghai Office of Income Tax has personally attended. We take this opportunity to ask him about any unclear aspects of the tax payment procedures and ask him to answer everything." Then, Secretary Yan Ese reported that item 4 of the declaration of business capital form refers to sole proprietorships, and item 5, "Amount of Paid-in Shares," refers to partnerships. In addition, the interest income from business deposits can also be subject to a handling fee of 10/1000 according to the established practice of the banking industry.

Liang's Speech

Liang Hejun, director of the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, said, "Levying income tax is a necessary and effective financial policy during the national crisis. Our country is seeking national revival and self-reliance, which is imminent. Therefore, today's income tax can be said to be a requirement of the people rather than a government initiative. Former consultant Gamal once said, 'China does not yet have a registered statistics of population and property, and cannot immediately implement income tax.' Recently, Li Ziluosi also said, 'If China wants to implement income tax, it should be handled by foreigners like the customs and post office.' Foreigners often have such views. However, our government has resolutely implemented it. In just a few months, it has achieved results. This is based on the patriotism and self-consciousness of the people. Although social institutions and economic conditions are still incomplete, we believe that after detours and struggles, we will eventually reach the realm of the road. At present, there are 17 units in the country handling income tax. The number of personnel in each unit ranges from a dozen to fifty or sixty, depending on the complexity of local commerce. Most of them are experts or college students who have been tested and trained. It is by no means like the situation of ordinary agencies. At present, a foreign reporter is writing in a certain evening newspaper, criticizing that the tax agency uses too few people, which is quite laughable. Although there are only more than 30 people in the Shanghai Office, the tax collection is handled by the Central Bank and 30 post offices in the city. The audit is handled by all the accounting experts of the future Central Trust Bureau. The investigation is handled by the entire Social Bureau Credit Investigation Office in the city. There are more than 115,000 units for withholding. Therefore, in Shanghai alone, the number of people mobilized for income tax has reached more than 100,000. What the reporter said about relying on only a few people to do things is ridiculous. Foreigners use special rights and maliciously propaganda, which is abominable. However, we are now burying our heads in hard work and self-reliance. We will do it first and say it later. Facts speak louder than words, so we disdain to argue with these irresponsible reporters and say idle words. The tax payment situation has been very enthusiastic recently. Not to mention the Chinese, even the Chinese employees in foreign firms, such as Wah Hai, Ke Pei, Medi, Fu Kang, Ji Bei, Yi Hua, Yu Xing, Lian Na, Bu Nei Men, and other foreign firms, and the Allied Life Insurance Company, An Bao Insurance Company, and Daley Accounting Firm, and other companies have voluntarily reported to the office in no less than 20 cases. It can be seen that our original intention of self-reliance has won a lot of sympathy. If we continue to work hard, we will naturally be greatly successful. In short, income tax must be fair and universal. However, to achieve fairness and universality, foreigners must pay taxes to be meaningful, and the people who handle it will be considered to have fulfilled their responsibilities. However, to make foreigners pay taxes, the people of our country must first actively contribute to be considered self-reliant. In the past month, the merchants and people of the country have unanimously supported this new tax system of self-reliance, which has been proven. In the future, we must hope that everyone will unite and urge the government to be able to handle fair income tax, universal income tax, and more meaningful income tax. This is not only the responsibility that the people in the government dare not forget, but also what everyone should work together to achieve. Today, those who are present are all cadres of various industry groups. I hope to base this idea on guiding the colleagues. If there are still those who are not enthusiastic, we should give them a practical explanation. The most important things to do at present are: ⑴ Declare Capital: The declared capital amount can be obtained from the Chamber of Commerce or the respective trade association, or from this office to obtain the prescribed reporting form. If it is a sole proprietorship, fill in the amount of capital in column 4 of the form. If it is a partnership, fill in the total amount of paid-in capital in column 5 of the form. If the partnership organization has been approved and registered by the Ministry of Industry, fill in the company reporting form prescribed by this office item by item. Do not be afraid of reporting capital, everyone, that you will be subject to any restrictions in the future. If there are any changes in the future (for example, adding the reserve fund to the capital, etc.), or the filling is incorrect, you can correct it, and there is no restriction. ⑵ Declare Deposits: A report form for commercial firms and deposit reports has also been established. Speaking of ordinary commercial firms, many actually have deposits. The government only cracked down on the publicly solicited and savings parts in the past. Other parts are not on the list of cracked down, don't suspect. We should quickly collect the forms and fill them out. ⑶ Withhold Salaries and Remuneration: The Chamber of Commerce should withhold the income tax on the salaries and remuneration of employees for January of this year. The reporting and payment period has arrived. In recent days, tens of thousands of reporting and payment units have arrived. This office has also sent letters to various trade associations to forward the notification letters, urging the commercial firms in attendance, and published an announcement in the newspaper. I hope that everyone will inform their colleagues to report and pay as soon as possible to avoid exceeding the limit. If the tax payable is less than 5 yuan, if everyone finds it troublesome and is willing to consolidate the payment, the person in charge only needs to report to this office, and he will be allowed to consolidate the payment once every three months. ⑷ Withhold Interest on Deposits: The reporting and payment of the income tax on interest on deposits for January of this year has arrived.

Those who have reported have reached millions. When each household is issued interest, it should be withheld at the tax rate prescribed in Article 6 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, which is 50/1000. The handling fee item is of course handled in the same way as the banking industry. For the above three or four items, if there is no withholding tax in that month, the notification letter issued by this office can be attached to the reply letter and mailed to this office for verification, or if the reporting and payment procedures and filling methods are unclear, you can inquire at the "Inquiry Office" of this office, and the person in charge can give instructions one by one. I hope that you can do the above points, and in terms of procedures, this office will do its best to simplify it. For example, salaries and remuneration were originally scheduled to be withheld monthly. Later, some people said that if they were withheld monthly, the amount below 5 yuan was too small, and the round-trip fare and time were not economical. This office has changed it and allowed it to be reported in aggregate. For example, salaries and remuneration were originally required to be withheld monthly, but now a specific advance reporting method is also available. Each business can estimate the number of employees and salaries for the year and withhold them once. If there are any changes at the end of the year, supplementary reports are still allowed. These are all specially accommodated in the middle of the law. In the future, if the business community still feels inconvenient, this office should try its best to come up with ideas within the scope of what is possible in terms of reason and sentiment. If this office does not have the power in time, it will also ask the Ministry of Finance on its behalf, because I have served in the financial industry and have been the president of the High Court and the director of the Finance Department. I know that the government's tax collection, no matter how perfect the principles are, as long as there is a slight inconvenience in the procedure, it will make the taxpayers feel that money and time are wasted. This is what makes taxpayers feel the pain of being difficult and troublesome. Therefore, this time I was ordered to handle income tax, and I have made up my mind to seek convenience for the merchants and people. Don't treat me as a tax official, but treat me as a member of the public service. I should always be urged or reprimanded. The officials of the past did not make the people love them, but only made the people fear them. Now, the reason for handling income tax is to revive the nation and be self-reliant. The government and the people should be united and stand on the same line to fight to the end. A certain foreigner once said that the Chinese were loose sand, but recently he changed his tone and said that the Chinese have become as strong as cement. Are we like cement or loose sand? This should be a unanimous reflection and effort. Finally, I have one more sentence to report to you incidentally: Income tax is originally a lottery tax. If you want the tax to be prosperous, you must make the merchants and people rich. Now the central government is paying great attention to the development of the national economy. The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session also has an exact expression. Minister Kong has the determination to develop the national economy by using the power of the government, the financial resources of the government, or the convenient methods prescribed by the government. On the one hand, everyone should put forward various plans based on their own business to tell the government and subsidize the progress. If everyone is living a good life, our income tax can of course benefit from it. This is an even deeper meaning in the voice of self-reliance." After Liang's speech, Huang Yisheng, secretary of the office, Tang Wenkai, and Yan Ese, secretary of the City Chamber of Commerce, answered questions and the meeting adjourned.

### Zhang Fang Hosted Guests from All Walks of Life Yesterday

Report on the Drought Situation in Henan Province, Establishment of Relief Committee from All Walks of Life

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Central Committee Member Zhang Fang called for relief to the drought in Henan Province. He specially hosted guests from all walks of life in the city at the 8th floor of the Hua'an Apartments at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the disaster situation. The Shanghai Relief Committee for the Henan Drought was organized, and Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was appointed Honorary President, and Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, was appointed President. It was established today. The details are recorded below.

Hosting Guests from All Walks of Life

The leaders from all walks of life who attended included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Education Director Pan Gongzhan, Local Association President Du Yuesheng, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, as well as Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Shouyong, Yu Zuoting, Jiang Yiping, Li Dachao, Chen Hang, Song Hanzhang, Wu Yun Chu, Hu Bijang, Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Yiting, Tang Shoumin, Qian Jingping, Guo Wufang, Shen Na, and more than 100 others. They were received by Zhang Fang and Lu Dangping, Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education.

Zhang Fang's Report

Zhang Fang gave a report on the drought situation in Henan Province on the spot, stating that Henan Province was unfortunate and suffered frequent disasters. There was a severe drought last year, and it did not rain for years. The autumn crops yielded nothing, and the second wheat was mostly not sown. The wheat harvest is hopeless this year. Even if there is rain in the future, it will not be possible to obtain food until after the autumn. Ninety-three counties in the province were affected, the most seriously affected were 27 counties including Dengfeng, the next most seriously affected were 34 counties including Runan, and the next most seriously affected were 32 counties including Xuchang. The disaster area accounted for nine-tenths of the province, and there were more than 9 million victims, at least half of whom could not survive without accounts. A few months ago, the stems of sweet potatoes, cotton leaves, elm bark, locust beans, etc. were all eaten. Some even used wheat straw and stone powder to fill their hunger. Some sold their wives and children for food. Those who were displaced and fled to all directions numbered more than a thousand. At the Minquan County Railway Station, more than 2,000 victims were competing to board the train, and there were clashes with the security team, resulting in four deaths and dozens of injuries. There were also thousands of victims at Guanyintang and other places in Luoyang, demanding to take the train. Famine victims from other counties came to the province to eat, and the roads were blocked. The southeast gates of the provincial capital were closed for many days. Recently, incidents of organized grain robbery have occurred in Fugou, Xihua, and other counties. Those who are weak and unable to find food either hang themselves in their homes or commit suicide by cutting their stomachs. All kinds of tragic situations cannot be described. Previously, the central government issued 300,000 yuan in public bonds, which was equivalent to more than 180,000 yuan in national currency, which was distributed for urgent relief. It was a drop in the bucket, and very few were fully alive. After the spring, it became more and more serious. A large number of victims died every day. As Tang Song and Guo, special commissioners of the Central Supervision and Release, said, if we do not continue to raise large sums of money and provide universal relief, the tragic situation of widespread starvation in Guanzhong in 1929 will surely reappear in Henan. Fang is responsible for Henan's relief and feels anxious. In addition to proposing a proposal for food at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, I believe that our country's morality has always been focused on responsibility and comfort. Shanghai is the meeting place of charitable, chivalrous, artistic, and major benefactors. Whenever there is a disaster in the country, they all rush to help and strive to provide relief. The scope of the disaster area and the number of victims in Henan Province this time is unprecedented, and it is located in the Central Plains. The governance, security, and stability are related to the overall situation. At this time of unity against the enemy, it is especially important to help each other in times of crisis. I beg you to show great compassion and initiate fundraising for the disaster victims in Henan Province, so that the day of Henan's people's rebirth will be the day when they do their best to serve the country in return for your kindness."

Organization Meeting Place

Then, Lu Dangping, Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education, supplemented the report on the disaster situation, and Wang Xiaolai and others gave speeches, which were omitted. Then, Jiang Yiping proposed to organize a committee to preside over the implementation. It was decided to organize the "Shanghai Relief Committee for the Henan Drought," and set up a meeting place in the Local Association, and drafted a charter. Article 1: The Shanghai Relief Committee is organized by all circles to assist with fundraising for the drought in Henan and is named the Shanghai Relief Committee for the Henan Drought. Article 2: The meeting place of this committee is located in the Local Association in the Zhonghui Building. Article 3: This committee will have several members, who will be publicly elected by the initiators from all walks of life. Article 4: This committee will have one honorary president, six honorary vice presidents, one president, four vice presidents, fifteen standing committee members, one general secretary, and two deputy general secretaries to handle daily affairs, who will be publicly elected by the initiators. Article 5: This committee will have a general affairs group to handle publicity, documents, accounting, general affairs, and public relations. Article 6: This committee will have a fundraising group to handle the collection of donations and articles and the custody of donations. Article 7: Each group will have one director, one deputy director, and several clerks to handle daily affairs. Article 8: The operating expenses of this committee will be freely donated by the initiators and members. Article 9: The committee and the standing committee of this committee will meet once every half a month, convened regularly by the president. Article 10: The working period of this committee is up to two months. Article 11: The detailed rules for this committee will be formulated separately.

### Jade Exhibition for the Paris Exposition Opens Yesterday Morning

Chu Minyi Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing to Oversee Everything / Unprecedented Event Showcasing the Crystallization of a Century of Jade Art

The preview exhibition of jade art pieces for China's participation in the Paris International Exposition opened yesterday morning on the fourth floor of the Sun Sun Department Store. No ceremony was held. From morning until evening, people from all walks of life in the city were invited to visit. Public viewing will begin tomorrow. Tickets are available for sale at various companies. Group visits will receive special discounts. The details are as follows:

A Room Full of Treasures

The Emerald Jade Pagoda, which was sent to the Chicago Exposition in the United States three years ago, caused a sensation in Shanghai. It was considered a rare treasure and the crystallization of a century of jade art in China. However, due to the rushed timeframe, it could not be exhibited domestically. The exhibitor, Zhang Wendi, told reporters from the Central News Agency that he deeply regretted this. Therefore, before going to France this time, a preview exhibition was specially held. At the same time, hundreds of pieces of precious jade were collected from domestic collectors and antique dealers, all of which are rare treasures. The room is filled with dazzling displays, truly an unprecedented event in Shanghai in recent years.

Inviting All Sectors

The first day of the opening yesterday morning was an invitation for all sectors. From 10 o'clock, viewers arrived one after another. Mr. Zhang Wendi was on site to receive guests. Mr. Chu Minyi, Chairman of the delegation, came to Shanghai from Nanjing especially and visited the site carefully for a week at eleven o'clock. According to his statement to the Central News Agency reporters, the entries for this competition are very exquisite and numerous, all the result of the efforts of the Chinese people. He is very honored to attend as a representative and hopes to take the time to visit. It is said that the Emerald Pagoda will be offered for sale in France at a good price. When reporters inquired of Mr. Zhang, he denied it. According to him, this item is a rare treasure of modern China, and he deeply hopes that it will not fall into foreign hands. As for the value of the pagoda, it cannot be estimated, but it is said that the insurance is two million yuan.

Exquisite Emerald Pagoda

The layout of the venue is simple and magnificent. The Emerald Pagoda is placed in the center, lined with green silk, and placed on a table. It is two meters high and five meters square. The pagoda has seven levels, modeled after the Longhua Pagoda. The carved railings of each level are particularly exquisite. The pendants and corner bells on the top of the tower are all made of jade. When the breeze passes, the bells ring crisply, like knocking on gold and jade. The interior of the pagoda and the palace lanterns are all equipped with electric torches, shining brightly. The so-called "Three Wonders of Jadeite" is indeed not an empty reputation. The base of the pagoda is exquisitely inlaid with cloisonné enamel, and below it are three layers of mahogany steps. The railings and stone steps are also carved from jade. There is a memorial archway and two palace lanterns, the style is elegant, and the overall figures are finely carved, each vividly portraying the likeness. As for the beauty of the archway, it is another matter. There are also lion, tortoise, crane, sundial and other parts, placed around. The entire project took ten years to complete. It is called a unique treasure of China, which is not an exaggeration.

Other Jade Items

This exhibition features an extremely extensive collection of jade items, totaling more than 1,800 pieces, large and small. The preciousness of the jade and the exquisite carving are rarely seen. In addition to the three wonders of the Emerald Jade Pagoda, the archway, and the palace lanterns, there are also coral phoenixes, jade "Four Joys Ascending the Plum Tree" vases, lapis lazuli double chicken cups, amber Cowherd and Weaver Girl, white jade chain vases, Western-style white jade vases, white jade incense burners, emerald openwork flower baskets, five-color jade fishermen's benefit jars, crystal Queen Mother Longevity Star vases, jade landscape plaques, white jade Guanyin, and emeralds in large numbers. Due to space limitations, they could not be fully displayed. It has now been decided to change them every two days for people to appreciate.

A Glimpse of the Reviews

Yesterday, leaders from all walks of life left inscriptions and comments after the visit. Pan Gongzhan said, "Fantastic and bizarre, surpassing nature's craftsmanship."

Li Shizeng said, "Rare treasures." Zhao Jinqing said, "National essence and rare treasures." Wang Yiting said, "Treasure of the world."

### Mo Keming Discusses the Hainan Island Industrial Inspection Group

According to Xin Xin News Agency, Li Xingqu, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, has invited Mo Keming to Shanghai to meet with Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Economic Commission, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the development of Hainan Island. The organization of an industrial inspection group is progressing smoothly. The reporter met Mr. Mo at the office of Mr. Xiao Songjun, the manager of the Xin Xin Company, yesterday afternoon. According to him, Hainan Island is a barrier for our country's South China Sea, and its climate is suitable, so it is also an excellent industrial area in southern China. All tropical agricultural products such as forests, coffee, rubber, coconuts, and sugar cane are available. Other industries such as mining and fishing can also be developed. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce specially initiated the connection between the industrial circles of Guangzhou and Shanghai to organize an industrial inspection group to go to Hainan Island for inspection as a basis for development. Now Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission, is particularly enthusiastic in supporting this matter. The central government plans to allocate huge funds to first handle Hainan Island's transportation and port construction. At the same time, it advocates that the government should not compete with the people for profits and welcomes capital circles at home and abroad to jointly invest. The negotiations in Shanghai this time went smoothly. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, has separately solicited opinions from banking and other trade associations to send personnel to participate in the inspection group. The National Economic Commission decided to send mining experts and agricultural experts to accompany the inspection group for investigation. Once Shanghai's solicitation is completed, it is planned to gather in Hong Kong and depart in early April, welcoming people from the industrial and financial sectors to actively participate.

### Strike by Machinists at the British Tramway Company

Party and Government Mediate Yesterday / But No Results

According to Da Gong News Agency, Zhang Shunbao and Zhang Shiqing, workers in the machine room of the old Hart Road factory of the British Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession, were fired by the company for exceeding the leave period. After the workers in the factory negotiated with the company, the request to reinstate them was ineffective. Therefore, from 10 o'clock (on the 3rd), 86 workers joined the strike. Yesterday morning, 76 workers at the Huixiao Road factory and 299 workers at the Beikaier Road factory also joined the strike and put forward conditions to negotiate with the capitalists, but were rejected and unresolved. Yesterday, all the workers continued the strike, and the situation was quite serious.

Party and Government Investigation

Yesterday morning, Lu Yinchu of the Municipal Party Department's Civil Movement Section, Yu Yaoqiu of the Investigation Section, Zhu Jintao, a staff member of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gong Yuting of the General Labor Union went to the workers' side to investigate the truth of the strike and separately summoned the foremen of various departments for talks and to discuss solutions. However, the workers' will was quite firm, and it may not be easy to resolve the strike for a while.

Mediation Result

At 2 pm yesterday, the representatives in charge went to the company's general office on North Suzhou Road to meet with manager Evan, vehicle supervisor Broker Hua, compradors Hu Zixing, etc., to mediate. As a result of the mediation, the capitalists agreed to consider handling the wages during the strike period, but did not agree to accept other conditions, so it has not yet been resolved.

Both Sides' Attitudes

In order to understand the attitude of the workers, a reporter from Da Gong News Agency specifically inquired about their opinions from the workers' representatives. According to them, the workers have put forward seven required conditions, including everything, but in terms of facts, they hope that the company will accept: (1) Fire two workers and allow them to resume work. (2) Regardless of retirement or dismissal, dismissal pay must be given uniformly without limitation of years, one month for one year (and so on). If these two methods are accepted, they will immediately resume work. The company's representatives were then consulted about their opinions. According to the person in charge of the company, the two dismissed workers were actually lazy at ordinary times and often asked for leave, so the company had no choice but to fire them. Now the workers do not understand the truth and suddenly go on strike to make demands, which is unreasonable. The conditions put forward by the workers are difficult to accept, but they hope to uphold the emotions of labor and capital, take into account the transportation business, and resume work immediately, otherwise the company will recruit new workers to maintain business.

### Labor Dispute at the British-Owned Lun Chang Printing and Dyeing Factory

Party and Government Mediation Yields No Results

Hundreds of male and female workers in the cloth machine room of the British Lun Chang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, announced a slowdown on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month. The dispute was resolved peacefully through negotiations between labor and management and work was restored. Unexpectedly, more than a thousand male and female workers in the yarn spinning room also made demands and stopped working on the 3rd. After the yarn spinning room stopped work, other rooms were also affected, so more than 2,000 male and female workers in the entire factory were virtually in a state of slowdown. According to the company's announcement, the factory has always provided particularly good treatment to workers, and wages are higher than other factories. Even the lowest wages are equal to those of other factories. Moreover, in the depression, the factory is still operating day and night in order to maintain the workers' livelihoods. The factory suddenly went on strike without prior legal procedures to make requests, so the reasons are unknown. Now the factory has notified Ding You to invite 20 representatives to negotiate reasonable solutions, but it said that it is impossible to accept the wage increase, and other matters can be discussed at length. The company authorities posted a notice at the factory gate yesterday morning, announcing a temporary shutdown. The original text of the notice reads: "Our company has always treated workers very well, and wages are also higher than other factories. In recent years, other factories have been suspended due to the impact of the depression, and our company has tried to maintain operations in order to take care of the workers' livelihoods and avoid difficulties in their lives. All of these are obvious to all, but recently a part of our company's spinning workers suddenly made unreasonable demands and disrupted the factory, causing losses to the company, which is regrettable. Therefore, our company will temporarily suspend operations until there is a satisfactory solution between the two parties."

According to Da Gong News Agency, after being informed of the situation, the Municipal Party Department sent Li Weixiong and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhang Chuqiang to Pudong at 2 pm yesterday to join Zhang Mingqin, the Director of the Pudong Police Sub-bureau, to first summon more than 20 representatives of textile workers at the sub-bureau to investigate the truth of the labor dispute and inquire about the purpose of the demands. Then they went to the factory to mediate. The capitalists said that it was possible to continue the treatment portion, but refused to accept the wage portion and there was no room for accommodation, resulting in no results in the mediation. It is now known that representatives of party and government agencies are scheduled to conduct mediation again this morning to eliminate the dispute as soon as possible.

### Shallow Water Fee on the Yangtze River Canceled Starting Today

At the Same Time, Freight Rate Increases by 20%

The water level of the Yangtze River has risen greatly in recent days and has returned to the level before winter. The Shanghai-Hankou line is now open. The shallow water fee increased by various shipping companies during the shallow water period was originally scheduled to be canceled on the 10th of this month, but after discussions by China Merchants and six other companies yesterday, it was decided that the shallow water fee would be canceled from today (6th) and the original freight rate would be increased by 20% across the board, which will be implemented on the same day. As for the shallow water fees on the Hankou-Hunan and Hankou-Yichang lines, they will remain the same. They will be reduced after the water level recovers.

### Factory Inspection Starts Today with the First Phase of Factory Inspection

The Whole City is Divided into Twenty Major Districts / Divided into Three Groups for Research to Improve

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Factory Inspection Office has already been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau after Director Tian reported on the implementation plan for the first phase of factory inspection and it will be implemented from yesterday. The whole city will be divided into twenty major districts, which will be handled by inspectors Li Chongpu and others. It is scheduled to be completed in three months. The details are as follows:

Implementation Steps

The implementation steps of the first phase of factory inspection shall comply with the regulations of the Central Factory Inspection Office: (1) Matters related to factory records; (2) Matters related to the work of child laborers, female workers, and apprentices; (3) Matters related to workers' allowances and pensions; (4) Matters related to accidents, deaths, and injuries; (5) Matters related to apprenticeship contracts and treatment; (6) Laws and regulations related to implementation and inspection; (7) Preparatory work for the four phases after this procedure. The above steps are scheduled to be completed in three months.

The institute has divided the whole city into twenty major districts, which will be handled by inspectors Jiang Zhiyong, Li Chongpu, Lu Jicang, Shen Risheng, Wu Binghai, Wang Xiangyu, etc., and divided into three groups: (1) The first group, Li Chongpu and Shen Risheng, will study the records of each factory. (2) The second group, Jiang Zhiyong, will study the apprentices in each factory. (3) The third group, Wu Binghai and Wang Xiangyu, will study the child laborers and female workers in each factory. After the inspection is completed, it will be submitted to the above three groups for research, the purpose of which is to improve the records, apprentices, child laborers, and female workers in each factory.

Boiler Inspection

Regarding boiler inspection matters, the Social Affairs Bureau has issued a public notice that factories that newly install or refit boilers should submit drawings and explanations of the boiler type, style, use, working pressure, installation location, and other relationships with the workplace to the bureau for review and approval before starting work. The same applies to those already installed, and the registration deadline is the end of March. Now that the deadline is approaching, it is hoped that all factories will submit their applications for registration before the end of this month.

### Robbery and Murder Case at Jingyun Mansion

The Remaining Thieves Were Also Punished According to the Circumstances / Eight Thieves Handed Over to the Police Bureau for Interrogation

There is no need to discuss any provisions regarding exemptions. Therefore, this letter is being sent for your information and compliance."

### Penalties for Food Stores, etc., Not Donating License

A Total of Over Forty Businesses

The Public Concession's Bureau of Health has always stipulated that food stores, laundry shops, caterers, etc., must donate (to) a permit, in order to facilitate the management of hygiene facilities.

Because they have not donated a license, it is impossible to verify whether the hygiene facilities of these stores are adequate, which is extremely relevant to the health of the people in the concession. Therefore, subordinates were instructed to conduct a thorough investigation. Any businesses found to have not donated for a license will be served a ticket to appear in the First Special District Court to be penalized. Yesterday afternoon, over forty businesses were prosecuted by the Bureau of Health. The Public Concession's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, appeared in court, requesting strict penalties. Judge Ye Shengchao considered the circumstances of the cases and imposed appropriate fines on each one.

### Chamber of Commerce Explains Ambiguities in Stamping

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce explained two ambiguities regarding stamp duties yesterday as follows: ㊀Regarding your letter of the 4th of this month inquiring whether price draft books should be stamped, this matter was addressed in a document issued by the Ministry of Finance (Taxation Document No. 18917) on October 17, 1935, to Cheng Jiyun, Commissioner of Stamp Tax Inspection, stating that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had previously inquired about whether correspondence books used by stores should be stamped. The Ministry verified that they do not need to be stamped. Therefore, correspondence books can also be exempted from stamping. Also, in a document issued by the Ministry of Finance (Taxation Document No. 22002) on January 27, 1936, to Gu Xiance, Commissioner of Stamp Tax Inspection, it was stated that correspondence books used by stores are only used for communication and record-keeping, so they do not need to be stamped. Therefore, you can follow these guidelines and do not need to stamp them. ㊁Regarding your letter of the 4th of this month stating that your factory uses a fiscal year system for closing accounts, and that it appears that the years 1926 and 1931 have already passed, inquiring whether it is necessary to add additional stamps. According to the regulations in the second half of Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the Stamp Tax Law, "If accounts are closed according to a fiscal year, the deadline should be the end of the fiscal year. Any continued use beyond the deadline should require additional stamp tax." Therefore, merchants who close accounts according to a fiscal year do not need to add stamps to their books before the end of the fiscal year, as permitted by law. However, for the sake of clarity during inspections, it is advisable to stamp the first page of the book with the words "This factory's fiscal year is from [Month] of each year to [Month] of the following year," which would be more prudent.

On February 21st, a robbery occurred near Meixie Road in Nanshi. Huang Genrong, a 29-year-old Shandong native residing at 13 Xiangcheng Lane, Xinqiao Road in South Shanghai, who previously worked as a waterworks craftsman, was robbed of over 50 yuan in legal tender at around 8:00 AM that morning and was shot in the foot. He was accompanied by two friends to Renji Hospital for treatment. It has been learned that this case has some suspicious points, so the patrol officers escorted the two accompanying people to the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. After investigation by the leader of the fifth detective squad, it was revealed that the two accompanying people, Tian Houyin, 29 years old, from Shandong, residing at 13, Alley 611, Xietu Road, and Zhu Youxin, 32 years old, from Xuzhou, residing at 16 Fuxing Lane, Xinqiao Road, who sells salted fish for a living, and it was also discovered that there was no robbery in the Meixie Road area of Nanshi at the time. After strict interrogation, Tian Houyin confessed that the person who was shot, Huang Genrong, whose real name is Yu Xingcheng, was previously a soldier in the security team in Wuxi. He deserted with a Mauser pistol and came to Shanghai. They intended to commit robbery, but accidentally, the gun went off, causing injury to the leg. There is also an accomplice, Zhao Rulin, 33 years old, from Tianjin, who is hiding at 88 Ruanle Lane, Tangjiawan in the French Concession. They will join the French patrol officers and rush to arrest the suspect Zhao and the suspect Yao Baosen, Zhao's mistress, Yan Wangshi.

### Savings of Over Ten Years of Fishing Lost After Arriving in Shanghai Due to Fraud

False Claims that the Shopkeeper Absconded with Funds; Jiang Huan Accused of Fraud and Deception

Du Riyuan, a 48-year-old man from Muping, Shandong, has been fishing in Vladivostok for over ten years. He had modest savings and returned to China at the end of last year's lunar calendar. While passing through Shanghai, he was introduced by Jiang Yun, a fellow villager who also runs a small business in Vladivostok, to stay at the Xingfa Company, which belongs to Jiang Yun's cousin, Jiang Huan, at [Number] Huicheng Lane, Maidie'an Road, in the French Concession. Recently, Du has filed a suit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Jiang Huan, the owner of Xingfa Company, of fraud and deception and requesting legal action. According to his complaint, he arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok with Jiang Yun. Jiang Yun arranged for him to stay at the defendant's Xingfa Company. On December 14th of the lunar calendar, the defendant told the plaintiff that if he had money, he should deposit it in the accounting room, otherwise, they would not be responsible for any losses. Therefore, he deposited the US$230 in banknotes that he had brought with him in the defendant's accounting room. The next day, he deposited another 66 yuan and 2 jiao in national currency, which he had obtained by exchanging US$20. On the 24th, the defendant suddenly claimed that the head shopkeeper of the company had absconded with funds and was unable to return the deposited funds. He then claimed that there were still over 800 yuan in the accounting room's safe and that he could find a way to open it and distribute the money to the plaintiff and Jiang Yun for return. When the coppersmith was called to open it, there were only 81 yuan inside the safe. After deducting 2 yuan for the coppersmith, the net remaining was 79 yuan, and the plaintiff only received 49 yuan. Waiting until the 27th, the head shopkeeper still had not returned, so he went to the patrol station with the defendant. The defendant promised to compensate, but has not done so. The defendant is actually deliberately defrauding and encroaching on the funds and requests legal investigation. Based on the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, arranged for Judge Qiu to preside over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff arrived with his lawyer, but the defendant did not appear. The court stated that since the defendant did not appear, the trial could not proceed and announced that the defendant would be summoned again for the trial on the 9th. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Private Salt Smuggler Gets Revenge, Pushing Anti-Smuggling Officer into the River

Patrol Station Prosecutes for Attempted Murder

Ye Xinkang, a Ningbo native residing at 6 Zhicheng Lane, Fuyou Road in the Chinese-administered area of this city, makes a living by selling private salt. In August of last year, while transporting private salt to the French Concession, he was discovered by Zhou Changyou, an anti-smuggling officer from Qingjiang, and was arrested and prosecuted in the Second Special Court. Ye was sentenced to three months in prison. As a result, Ye and Zhou became enemies. On the morning of January 19th of this year, Ye Xinkang was transporting a load of private salt again to sell on a Yangtze River liner and was transporting it to Jinliyuan Wharf No. 2 when he was discovered by Zhou Changyou again. Ye took advantage of Zhou's lack of preparedness and pushed Zhou into the Huangpu River. He turned around and escaped. After falling into the river, Zhou was rescued by the efforts of a sampan boatman nearby and sent to the French patrol station to report the incident. He was then sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. On the 20th of this month, Ye Xinkang was arrested by the Municipal Police Bureau in the Chinese-administered area on suspicion of robbery. The French patrol station learned of this and yesterday learned that Ye had been transferred to their custody. He was sent to the Second Court for trial and detention pending investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special Court presided over a continued trial of the defendant in the First Criminal Court. Yuan Jiahuang, a lawyer from the medical office, presented the case, prosecuting the defendant under Article 135 and Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for attempted murder.

### Lawyers Association Contributes Opinions on Seizure of Land

If Specific Plots Are Indicated, They Can Be Responsible for Accurate Seizure

The Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday submitted a document to the Shanghai District Court and the First and Second Special District Courts, stating: "Regarding a request for submission, it is reported that member Xu Zuoliang proposed: 'The enforcement of judgments is the responsibility of the court. All Chinese government agencies have an obligation to assist in the execution of the court. Recently, the Shanghai District Court has required creditors to investigate the plot numbers and acreage of the debtor's land before seizing it. When inquired about the reason, it was said that the seizure of land now requires notifying the Land Bureau to send personnel to jointly survey the land, but the Land Bureau refuses to send personnel because the plot numbers and acreage of the land have not been reported.' According to the investigation, the joint survey and measurement of the land to be seized has no legal basis. Now, it is even more inappropriate to refuse seizure because the plot number of the land is unknown. Since our country's land registration has not yet been established and the land has not been reorganized, how can the plot number of the debtor's land be ascertained? Since the Land Bureau is a Chinese government agency and is allowed to send personnel for joint seizure, if the Land Bureau does not assist the court in executing the general principles by investigating and filling out the land register, or ordering the local land guard to report, then who will have the opportunity to ascertain the plot number of the land? In 1935, the Land Bureau replied to the association, stating, 'Regarding the appraisal of land prices requested by various courts in this city, we follow the procedures stipulated by this bureau. Except for the appraisal of land that requires prior surveying and measurement, and cases where the reported plot number is incorrect, or the location is unclear, requiring the land guard to investigate and demarcate the boundaries, and single contracts with other disputes, which are temporarily difficult to complete within the time limit, we will complete the task within ten days of receiving the document. In light of this, when the parties report an incorrect plot number or an unclear location, the Land Bureau has impartially assisted and executed its duties by investigating. Why is it that only because the parties do not know the plot number of the land, they will not assist in the seizure? This seems to be not considerate enough to protect the interests of the creditors.' In light of this, we should send separate letters to the local courts and the Land Bureau. In the future, when creditors request the seizure of land, if they can be responsible for specifying the location, even if the plot number is not clear, the Land Bureau should investigate and report, or order the land guard to report, before the Land Bureau has reorganized the land register and made it public, and still seize the land to comply with the law." The 24th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the association discussed this matter and believed that Xu's proposal was not without merit and that separate letters should be sent to the courts and the Land Bureau. In addition to sending separate letters, we urgently request that your court review and approve the following: In the future, when creditors request the seizure of land, if they can specify the location and be responsible for its accuracy, even if the plot number is not clear, we should ask the Land Bureau to investigate and report by its authority, or order the land guard to report, and still seize the land before the Land Bureau has reorganized the land register and made it public, which would be very convenient for the public.

### Representative of the Party Department Stationed in Vietnam Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday to Go to Beijing

Zhou Qichu, the representative of the General Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang stationed in Annam, along with Zheng Manlin, an executive member of the branch, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Guangzhou on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ship "Haiyuan." They stayed at the Dongya Hotel and took a fast train to Beijing at noon for official business. Zhou is a native of Nanhai, Guangdong, and currently serves as a standing committee member and head of the organization section of the Executive Committee of the General Branch stationed in Annam, honorary advisor to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, director-general of the Vietnam Overseas Chinese General Labour Union, secretary of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association in Vietnam, and head of the business department of the Annam Minbao newspaper directly under the Central Government. He has been in Vietnam for over twenty years and is very familiar with the situation there. According to him, there are many special circumstances overseas that cannot be conveyed through writing, so a special envoy must be sent to meet with the central authorities to explain everything in person. This is the reason why he was appointed to return to China. Vietnam is a place where Sun Yat-sen once travelled and deeply sowed the seeds of revolution. Revolutionary pioneers, before the restoration, considered it easy to coordinate because it was adjacent to the motherland. For example, former Chairman Hu Hanmin and Chairman Wang Jingwei successively came to Vietnam to guide comrades and organize institutions. Therefore, in various revolutionary uprisings, comrades from that area participated and sacrificed their lives to a great extent. There are over ten thousand party members there. The general branch is located in Dike, Annam, and oversees ten branches and more than sixty sub-branches. All cities and important towns in Vietnam have party organizations, which cooperate well with the local overseas Chinese. Therefore, the promotion of public welfare, relief for disasters in the motherland, and national salvation movements have achieved excellent results. For example, after the outbreak of national crisis and the January 28th Incident, overseas Chinese enthusiastically contributed financially to support the border. During the floods in the motherland the previous year, people from all walks of life donated money for relief. Many overseas Chinese schoolteachers participated, and the academic community promoted the sale of admission tickets, raising eight or ninety thousand yuan in an instant. Even recently, the aid to Suiyuan is no less enthusiastic than before. The port has been affected by the economic downturn in recent years, and the number of overseas Chinese returning to China is increasing daily. It was previously reported that there were 400,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam, but now only half remain. Vietnam is most famous for its rice production. In the past, most of the rice milling industry (i.e., powered rice mills) was run by overseas Chinese, but it has now mostly changed hands. The current resident government is implementing a new system, stipulating that workers' working hours should not exceed eight hours. As a result, unemployment among factory workers has decreased. Last year, the franc depreciated, and prices rose slightly. In the past, the rice trade relied on sales to China, but since the imposition of taxes, Europe has purchased a lot of rice, and very little is transported to Hong Kong. Currently, there are Chinese consuls there. The consulate general is in Hanoi, North Vietnam, and the consulate is located in Saigon. Overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam pay a personal tax of 30 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen per year. If they open a store, they pay a business license tax, which ranges from dozens to over a thousand yuan depending on the size of the business. Last year, the election of candidates for the National Assembly was held there, and overseas Chinese participated enthusiastically in the election. It was found that the area should have two National Assembly representatives. According to the organizational law, several people must be elected first, and the central government will select three from them. The remaining six people will then be re-elected by the overseas Chinese to select three official representatives. The elected candidates are Lin Zechen (Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissioner of the National Government), Zhang Guowei (Colonel Secretary of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters), Liu Houwu (Commissioner of the Control Yuan), Tao Duiting (Director of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce), Xiang Yutang (Standing Committee Member of the Vietnam Overseas Chinese General Labour Union), Liu Zeng (Chairman of the Xidi Qifu Public Office), Wang Yusen (Chairman of the Hakka Chongzheng General Association), Cao Yunze (Former President of the General Chamber of Commerce), and Xu Yixian (Secretary of the General Chamber of Commerce). I have been abroad for a long time. This time I returned to China to observe the construction and found that the progress is improving rapidly, which is refreshing. This shows the result of the hard work of the government authorities in recent years.

It was resolved to hold it at 9:00 AM on March 12th at the Chongnong Hall of the Zhuanqiao People's School on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. ㊁ A motion was made to invite members to arrange the facilities for the Arbor Day ceremony.

It was resolved to invite Director Qi Kezhong and District Head Zhang Fengsan to draft special management measures and investigate the damage and missing trees, and to find ways to replant them. ㊃ Regarding the roadside trees on the Shanghai-Minhang and Shanghai-Songjiang highways in the county, which should be planted by the respective transportation companies according to regulations, but have not been planted or replanted completely after repeated orders, how should they be supervised to proceed? It was resolved to order them to replant all trees by the 20th of this month. After the discussion was concluded, the meeting was adjourned.

In addition, the Shanghai County Education Bureau believes that planting trees in schools not only beautifies the environment but also complies with school hygiene. Yesterday, it specially issued a notice to its subordinates to tidy up the trees on campus during this year's Arbor Day. If there are any trees that have not been planted, they must be planted during this festival. The required seedlings can be collected from the seedling field of the Qianqiao People's Education Center. The Jiangwan Office of the Chamber of Commerce is handling the matter on their behalf.

### After Separating from His Wife, Wang Ligang Sued His Lover for Divorce

Wang Ligang, a native of Ningbo, is 30 years old and a shareholder of Wang Shunchang Tailor Shop at 421 Jing'an Temple Road. In November of the 15th year of the Republic (1926), he married Fu Meiyu (currently 29 years old), a woman from his hometown. Before a year had passed, the couple's relationship was not very harmonious, and they finally decided to separate. Wang paid her 30 yuan per month for living expenses. She lived alone at No. 1 Xinmin Lane, Bairbu Road, and later moved to Dongyouheng Road for about seven or eight years. The couple only existed in name and never saw each other. In September of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), Wang met Chen Yuliang, a native of Baoshan. Initially, it was only a friendly relationship, but because Meiyu became seriously ill, Chen Yuliang accompanied her bedside day and night, decocting medicine and serving her. Meiyu was touched by Chen's sincerity and repaid him with her body, living together and forming a small family at No. 7, Lane 370, Yuanfang Road. Wang Ligang learned of this and, at the cost of 30 yuan per month, ended up with a cuckold. He was greatly angered and reported the matter to the police in September of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), arresting Meiyu and Chen and sending them to the First Special Court. Fu Meiyu was sentenced to two months' imprisonment with a three-year reprieve. Chen Yuliang was found not guilty because he did not know that Fu Meiyu was married. Now, Wang Ligang believes that his wife's actions are irreversible, so he hired lawyer Jiang Rong to file a lawsuit in the local court requesting a divorce. Judge Wang Yi opened the court yesterday, but neither party was present. Only the plaintiff's agent, Lawyer Jiang, appeared in court and requested a default judgment. The judge ordered that a new summons be issued for further investigation.

### Accomplice in the Wang Ada Murder Case Captured While on the Run

Wang Ada, a local who served as an inspector (i.e., detective) in the Zhabei Public Security Bureau, was lured out of the Sihai Teahouse on Dongxi Huade Road at around 2:00 PM on February 19th of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) by his enemies, who shot him in the head, intending to take his life, and fled in a panic. Subsequently, the police arrested the perpetrators Zhang Xingsheng, Tang Xinfa, and others, and sent them to the First Special District Court. After questioning, they were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. They confessed that the mastermind, Zhu Atang (also known as Little Ghost Atang), a native of Ningbo, was on the run. At around 8:00 AM on the morning of the previous day, Chinese Detective Feng Qishan and Detective Xia Shutang learned that he was hiding at the Tangshan Hotel at No. 434 Tangshan Road in the Canal District. They secretly went to the address and arrested him, taking him to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Public Works Department explained the case and prosecuted him for attempted murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting a postponement. Subsequently, the victim Wang Ada testified about the circumstances of being ambushed and shot at the time, and Zhu Atang's testimony was evasive. Judge Dai Rongduo ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### The "Municipal Donation" in Extraterritorial Road Sections

— Jianping

Shanghai has concessions, and there are also so-called "extraterritorial road sections." Originally, the municipal authority in the "extraterritorial road sections" belonged to our national municipal government, and the houses on both sides were also marked with city boundary plaques, and the municipal finance bureau sent personnel to collect municipal donations. Also, the municipal police bureau sent standing posts on the road to protect public security. Now, a sudden piece of news says that the Public Concession authorities plan to collect municipal donations from the owners of various businesses in the "extraterritorial road sections" and threaten to cut off water and electricity. Obviously, this issue has developed significantly. In addition to hoping that the municipal authorities will strive for our national sovereignty, we have the following supplementary opinions.

Regarding the issue of "extraterritorial road sections," there have been negotiations on "recovering extraterritorial roads" in the past, but the result of the negotiations between the municipal authorities and the Public Concession authorities was that "due to various relationships, a thorough solution could not be obtained," and later it was suspended halfway. For a long time, we did not hear of any "thorough solution," and it has been silent. However, silence is certainly not a solution. This time, the Public Concession authorities' plan to collect municipal donations from property owners is a great lesson for us: if it is not a thorough solution, then it is not a solution. This is the first point.

Secondly, the Public Concession's method of collecting municipal donations this time is still the traditional method of "threatening to cut off water and electricity." This method has given us many lessons, but each time we still concede and succumb, because for merchants, this is a very big threat. They cannot live without water and electricity for a day, so even if they suffer a little loss, they are willing to deal with it carelessly. The "municipal donation" incident has already had a similar result. From this, we can know that the ending this time is in danger of repeating the mistakes. If we do not seek a comprehensive solution urgently, then it will be another terrible thing. According to the water and electricity issues of the "extraterritorial road sections," "in the extraterritorial road section of North Sichuan Road, most of the water and electricity have been supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. In the western part of Shanghai, electricity supply" is only "handled by the Shanghai West Electricity Company established with the approval of the municipal government," but all of this is "distant water cannot quench a present thirst," and a few property owners cannot help but "endure the pain and accept it." Isn't this another mistake of not being able to thoroughly solve the problem?

However, we cannot have any understanding of the few property owners who "endure the pain and accept it." The issue of the "municipal donation" in the extraterritorial road sections is related to the infringement of our national sovereignty. "Enduring the pain and accepting it" cannot protect national sovereignty, and it hinders the progress of "striving for it." This is, in any case, a foolish method of "living in the moment and taking chances." At the same time, the "municipal donation" in the extraterritorial road sections is also a whole and indivisible, and it cannot be partially solved by a few "enduring the pain and accepting it." Moreover, "enduring the pain and accepting it" will only cause greater "pain" and will not eliminate "pain." Therefore, we hope that the authorities will not forget to persuade this group of minority property owners who are willing to "succumb" and "endure the pain" while "striving for it." At the same time, we hope to analyze and solve the reasons why they "endure the pain." However, now it is still time to "mend the fold after losing the sheep." We must not only properly resolve the dispute over the "municipal donation," but also clear up the long-standing files on "recovering extraterritorial roads."

### The Trap of Great Shanghai

— Zhou Ge

There is a lady who wrote a "reportage," reporting the facts of her three encounters with traps while seeking employment in this Great Shanghai. The first trap she encountered was: a back alley elementary school. It turned out that the twenty-seven-year-old principal wanted to hire a female teacher in order to prepare her to be his wife; the second trap was: a small hospital that defrauded her of cash guarantees; the third trap was: a guide not much different from a prostitute.

When that lady went to contact the female teacher, standing in front of a school building consisting of two houses, she was stunned like this: "A school building of two shikumen houses, can it be considered a noble educational institution! I'm afraid it's a school shop that defrauds tuition fees! Can I bear to be a degenerate in the educational world?" This is, first, is the back alley elementary school completely a "school shop that defrauds tuition fees"? Therefore, second, even if the education world is full of degenerates, can we bear to watch these degenerates in the education world? If we have a little bit of initiative, we should go deep into the degenerate camp, "How can you get cubs without entering the tiger's den?" We absolutely cannot wear white gloves and let the degenerates remain degenerates forever.

When that lady escaped from the room that recruited guides, how angry she was! She wrote: "At this time, consciousness told me that this is a trap that forces me to sell my body and soul, what is an employee, it is simply a guide not much different from a prostitute! I am unwilling to die, no matter how poor, how can I entangle with these beast-like people to pollute my pure and noble personality." Here, first, are "these beast-like people" willing? Or are they, like that lady, forced by hunger and cold, and out of helplessness? Second, are "these beast-like people" truly morally corrupt? Is the corruption or nobility of personality because of the selling of the body? How many women, for the sake of chastity, endure cold and hunger, and even commit suicide out of shame and anger after losing their virginity, is unknown! This is the feudal concept of chastity, which has killed many people! At the same time, this feudal concept of chastity, I don't know how many pitiful women, are regarded as "beast-like people"! I want to shout out loud and protest for those pitiful women!

Although that lady encountered traps three times, she was not discouraged at all, she "worked harder to study and hoped to learn skills, be able to enter a legitimate professional institution, and use her own strength to exchange for her own life." This is commendable, but the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day, I am afraid this is not an illusion? Moreover, how many of the so-called "legitimate professional institutions" under the moon are not similar to traps for women?

The suffering of women…

### Spring Breeze Success

— Zheng Rong

Successful Career

The phrase "spring breeze success" has two meanings: one meaning is that "the spring breeze is gentle and successful," and one meaning is that "during the spring breeze, people's careers can be successful."

If a person is tired in spirit and weak in body during this intoxicating spring breeze, then he will fail this great spring, and his career will not be "successful" at all.

Therefore, anyone with an unhealthy body should take advantage of this spring season to take effective medicinal products, such as those with insufficient blood, should take the blood-replenishing "Zilai Blood." Those with insufficient lung qi should take "Wuzhou Milky White Cod Liver Oil" or "Globe Brand Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil." Because these three are famous tonics, with the reputation of "Three Heroes of Tonics" in normal times, now many successful people in society usually take these tonics to strengthen their bodies. I think that if the sick and weak can listen to me and take them every day, then this year, he can turn weakness into strength, and when the spring breeze comes next year, his career will definitely be successful.

### Evening Sky Longing

— Tian Qing

The chimney crawling on top of the village meeting hall spews wisps of white smoke, slowly dissipating in the smoky clouds of the twilight sky, turning into a melancholy mood that is hard to conceal; the western mountain supports the setting sun, and the shadows of the towering objects are dragged longer on the ground. There is no beautiful scenery of the sunset glow, this is a sad dusk.

The endless fields, the endless wheat seedlings, embroidered into boundless greenery, pouring out滔天碧浪. The crawling hills, the raised mounds, the Chinese tallow trees on the mounds have long shed the fallen leaves of red faces, leaving only the clumsy withered trunks, there to lament the passing of youth; the red leaves full of poetry, today also quietly snuggle against the soil, no more poets come here to chant farewells to the autumn waves. The sandy dust and withered leaves, like hating the exclusive beauty of the peach blossoms, rustle and roll up a whirlwind, knocking down the scattered flowers. Let the sobbing of the fallen flowers, let the silent sigh of the withered trees, only leaving the mockery of the cold wind, no more joyful奏樂of the鳴虫. The luxuriant grass does not透蔓延the business, quietly sighing out the desolation of fate. The distant city walls and ancient roads show an ancient and unbearable sorrow in the setting sun, and the eternal desolation.

In this corner that the eye can see, many lonely and monotonous scenes appear.

On the red mud road opened from the mountains and fields, there are often cars whizzing by - or it is the vitality that this corner of the world actually has. The village houses stand by the country road, and outside the hedge gate leans an ancient heart;凄

## Page 18

萋temples, the infinite wrinkles of remembrance and sorrow: all write out the chaos of this heart. Using all the remaining strength in life, closely watching the distant sky and sea, the faint clouds in the sky and sea, gently fly over one mountain peak after another ridge, the heart of a慈母, in the evening breeze and floating clouds, is even more sadly boundless.

By the ancient road, in the car, she earnestly seeks an object of her lifelong sorrow - the young son slowly returning from afar, to comfort the loneliness of the elderly, and to温回the enthusiasm she had long lost.

Crows crow in阵阵over the horizon, mothers calling their children to投进the long forest of the distant mountains. These filial慈鳥, their home, must be so passionate and comfortable, filled with the joy of reunion; in the home of the elderly; there is only the煢煢lamp light,凄凄accompanying the lonely thin shadow; the slow long night, it is difficult to find a good dream of游子returning home. Often because of the西風hitting the tiles, the狂吠of野狗, the蕭索of残葉; it is considered to be the履歩of游子returning home overnight: the慈母in暮年will冲开the陰寒and恐怖of深夜,幽幽wait in the bottomless darkness until dawn. But難眠輾轉,空数尽every rotation of time, listening to the哀诉of殘更漏;霜华重露, only she独领the寂静of the world. This暮天, this静悄悄country road, who will投给her a丝儿慰藉! ?

The setting sun has 收尽了the last brilliance, and the twilight色is gradually加浓. The灰黯night fog climbs up the roofs of people's houses,爬近the身旁of暮年people;遮糢糊了the outline of the distant mountains,遮濃厚了the寂静of the頽城古道. On the頽枝of乌柏, a few凄宿乱鳥often leave the branches unsteadily because of a gust of wind, a一声狗呌, and徘徊in the昏茫evening sky,哀哀singing out the misery of无家无恃,一声声呌痛the heart of the暮年people.

The evening wind撩起a惊人的怪呌,掀起the 衣角of暮年people,拂乱斑斑the鬓发,使the old and weak心神, in the阴冷的威胁里抖索……But the暮年慈母still can't bear to leave this处所;彷彿the昏茫twilight色will迷失the归家of游子.

### Violet

— Xin Ye

I can't remember when I started to love flowers.

Maybe, my recent life has been too leisurely. Often when I have nothing to do, I always want to find some pastime that suits my personality, or some entertainment that I like, to serve as a decoration in my life; however, there are really too few pastimes or entertainment that can suit my personality and that I like.

For the sake of my lung disease, the doctor once specified a very long period for me to recuperate, and he also forbade me to read newspapers, read books, and write articles. So, hoping to prolong my life, I was helplessly forced to return to my hometown. In the countryside, life is very monotonous, with no entertainment, no pastime, I haven't approached books and newspapers for a long time, and even if writing is not forbidden, I am too lazy to do it. Everything seems to be isolated in another world; moreover, every move of mine is monitored by my family, which is almost the same as eating官司in prison.

So, this is how I started to love flowers.

There was originally a garden in our home, but no one has ever tidied it up. The flower paths are not swept, the garden gate is often closed, and it is too desolate to look like anything.

Finally, because I had no place to spend the boring time day after day, I tidied up the garden, looked for many exotic flowers and rare herbs and evergreen trees, and planted them inside. Over the past year, this lonely garden has actually become a very lively flower garden.

In the early morning, whenever the sound of the cock crowing荡漾in the misty air, when every flower in the garden is刚沐着in the晶莹morning dew, I stand in front of the flowers, under the trees,鉴赏着the惺忪posture摇曳of every flower, gently swaying in the熹微morning light, like a妍丽多姿young girl, she is含情脉脉地, smiling and招手towards me.

Last year, a friend gave me a pot of violets; I left half of it in the pot, and divided the other half and transplanted it to the small pond in the garden. When he gave it to me, it was exactly April last year, the clusters of青翠碧绿leaves were covered with many细碎purple small flowers; the花萼is very奇特, a kind of馥郁芳香播送着, but it does not have the诱人的刺激香味of other flowers.

It is said that it can bloom twice a year, which is rare in evergreen species. I love it very much, I love it for having the fragrance of roses, but not as艳as roses, having the perseverance of plum blossoms, but more清高than plum blossoms.

Now, it is its flowering season again, and the clusters of青翠碧绿leaves are covered with many细碎purple small flowers. I love it for散着温馨气息in the sun, and I also love its艳丽姿态浸润in the rain and dew.

Whether in the 清晨or傍晚of every day, I always like to留连in this garden once, which has almost become my daily habit.

The color of the violet is not艳不淡, the fragrance of the violet is 香而不烈, it is just like a淡装雅緻and静娴girl. In my garden, I take care of it and cultivate it carefully, like taking care of my lover; in winter, I cover it with稻草at night, and in summer, I use curtains to挡了the过烈的阳光for it during the day, I watch it become more and more繁荣day by day, from a small clump to a large clump, and then I transplant it to many places.

Recently, my illness has gradually recovered, and for the sake of life and burden, I have left my hometown again, left that beloved garden, and what is especially worth依恋is that cluster of lovely violets.

It's spring, are the violets无恙耶,怅望着天涯, I can't help but伤感起来like missing a lover.
