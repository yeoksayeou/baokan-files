### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Takes a Sharp Turn, Condemning Japan's Warmongering

Ambassador Koo Requests That Countries At Least Assist China in Resisting the Enemy; U.S., British, and French Representatives Unanimously Oppose Changes Brought About by Violence

Brussels, Japan – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a plenary session today. Chinese Chief Representative Koo Vi Kyuin made a powerful appeal to the representatives of the nineteen nations, requesting that they cease supplying Japan and aid China. Koo stated that, after ten days, the conference had returned to its initial starting point. The conference's recent petition was as mild in its wording as the original invitation to Japan from the Belgian government and avoided mentioning the "League of Nations." The collective opinion of the fifty-one members of the League of Nations regarding China's invasion and the nature of Japan's military actions within Chinese territory were not touched upon. "But," Koo continued, "neither the spirit of mediation nor mild wording is of any use because the Japanese government's rejection is even more resolute than before. The wording and tone of Japan's reply seem to clearly indicate that all the diligent efforts of the conference to achieve its cooperation for the sake of peace and the dignity of treaties are now regarded as a sign of weakness, further encouraging its arrogance and contempt." Koo Vi Kyuin further stated, "Japan has repeatedly claimed that its current actions in China are a means of self-defense. This is not only a deliberate distortion of a term with a long history, but also an insult to the world's emotions, justice, and truth. Even if Japan is convinced that its acts of aggression in China are self-defense (which the Chinese delegation strongly denies), it can in no way be considered outside the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty." Koo stated further that "Article 7 of the treaty, concerning complete and frank mutual notification, was specifically established for this type of situation." Koo then pointed out that the Chinese government had previously exercised great tolerance for four years in order to reach a peaceful resolution with Japan regarding various outstanding issues. The result of this tolerance was only the current war. "Every concession and every expression of peace from China were seen by Japan as signs of fear, further encouraging its threats and insults." Koo added, "Japan's permanent double diplomacy, skillfully used by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military in all its interactions with China, has made China deeply aware of the danger and futility of direct negotiations with Japan." Regarding Japan's claim that the source of the current incident lies in the special circumstances of the Far East, Koo replied that China had never seen anything special about the situation in the Far East. If anything, it was Japan's use of military force to invade peaceful China in order to maintain peace in Asia. Whatever the situation, it was created by Japan itself and cannot be regarded as outside the scope of the treaty, but rather as a legitimate topic for discussion by all related families. The current Chinese government firmly believes that cooperation in the conference will not incite public opinion in the two countries, making a resolution more difficult, but will instead facilitate a resolution and increase faith in the propriety of the conference's adherence to treaty principles. Koo later pointed out that the Japanese government had requested that the countries concerned should promote stability in East Asia in accordance with the new situation, and asked, "Does this mean that the conference should accept the temporary changes brought about by force and pardon Japan for its open violation of treaty obligations, such as the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which clearly prohibit war? This is just an excuse for treaty breakers to impose a fait accompli on the conference." Koo further stated that the current war is not limited to China's territorial and political integrity. In fact, for the sake of peace, the principle that treaty obligations need not be respected is now in grave danger, which all countries should deeply consider. Koo stated that what China seeks is to live peacefully without external aggression, so that it can engage in the arduous task of political and economic construction. The Nine-Power Treaty had previously guaranteed China this opportunity, but today Japan's aggression has deprived it of this opportunity. "We today request the cessation of Japan's aggression and respect for the Nine-Power Treaty. All signatories to this treaty have a solemn obligation. As far as China is concerned, it is staking the lives and blood of its people in order to stop Japan's aggression and uphold the dignity of treaties. It is doing its utmost to protect its political and territorial integrity and to maintain the sacred principles of treaties. China's resistance will not stop until Japan's aggression stops. The Chinese government and people have resolved to fight to the end. The door to reconciliation and mediation has been slammed shut in the face of Your Excellencies by Japan's final reply. Can you not decide to stop supplying Japan with military supplies and instead supply China? In our opinion, this is the minimum you should do to fulfill your obligations, stop Japan's aggression, and uphold the treaties under discussion. Furthermore, in order to shorten the war and promote peace, it is necessary to avoid assisting the aggressor's economic resources and supplying it with a constant stream of arms and raw materials for manufacturing arms." Koo concluded his eloquent statement by saying, "International peace, like domestic peace, must be deeply maintained if it is to be permanently unbreakable. The restoration and maintenance of peace in the Far East today depends on the united action of all the countries present, morally, materially, and economically. This action must be taken in a timely manner, because if we hesitate and delay, the current booming violence and disorder in the Far East will expand to an uncontrollable point, and it will not stop until it brews a second, more tragic world war."

After Koo Vi Kyuin finished speaking, the U.S. Chief Representative Davis rose to speak, stating at the outset that if the idea of using force to bring about change prevails in the world, we will certainly encounter international anarchy. Respect for treaties and adherence to promises are the firm and unwavering foundation for creating peace. Apart from this, a fair and lasting solution to the Sino-Japanese conflict cannot be found. We welcome Japan's sending a representative to the conference to explain in detail the reasons for the outbreak of this conflict and the hidden causes of this conflict. However, Japan declined the invitation of this conference. Japan also rejected the proposal of this conference to invite Japan to exchange views with a small number of countries selected by this conference. In fact, this exchange of views is within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty and is consistent with its provisions. If Japan had not rejected this invitation, I believe that we could have been of great help to Japan, just as we could have been of help to China. We hope that Japan can realize this in the future and cooperate with this conference to jointly seek a fair and appropriate solution.

French Chief Representative Talbot rose to speak, refuting the proposal to use force to resolve disputes. He also stated that the sole desire of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to help the two countries reach an amicable solution. However, Japan's refusal to participate has created a difficult problem that this conference must study. In any case, any forced solution, whether morally or practically, cannot be a satisfactory or lasting solution. The relationship between these two countries, the peace of the Far East, and thus the peace of the world, must be conditional on respect for international law. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th) French Foreign Minister Talbot delivered a speech, stating briefly, "If we want to handle the Far East incident by force, whether legally or materially, we cannot achieve a satisfactory and lasting solution to Sino-Japanese relations. The peace of the Far East, like the peace of the world, should be based on respect for international law. Moreover, human civilization should also be based on respect for treaties and the fulfillment of promises. The independence of all countries and the independence of all governments must also be respected. As for ideological groups, they are not conducive to peace. France strongly advocates peace, but once an armed conflict occurs in any part of the world, no one can guarantee that it will not spread to other places." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th) Next, British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke, stating that the British government handles international politics based on international law. The British government is very willing to welcome Japan's cooperation with this conference and is willing to listen to Japan's presentation of its views on the current conflict. If Japan does so, this conference will have already begun a close study of this issue with China and Japan. This exchange of views is stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty, so it is very appropriate and can be a tool for obtaining a compromise solution to the Far East incident, so it is also very beneficial. Although Japan is not participating in this conference today, the British government, for the sake of the interests of China and Japan, still holds the view that this solution must eventually be found. The British government firmly believes that true and fruitful international relations can only be achieved through the general acceptance of international law. If a country is dissatisfied with the government and political system of another country and uses this as a reason to interfere in its internal affairs by force, then we cannot accept it. Any country has the privilege to live its own life in peace and harmony. If we recognize that one country can interfere in the internal affairs of another country, then we directly deny the right of all countries to live freely.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin also rose to speak, stating that the Soviet Union welcomes any method that can resolve the Far East incident equally and peacefully.

The Italian representative rose to say that he had nothing to contribute.

When the chairman announced the adjournment until 4:00 PM, he stated that the draft declaration prepared by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France would be distributed for discussion in the afternoon. It is expected that this draft will encounter some opposition, and it is still doubtful whether it can be established tonight, so the discussion may be extended to Monday.

### Countries Decide on Four Principles; Declaration to Be Issued Immediately After Adoption by the Assembly

However, Room for Maneuvering Still Left for Japan; Our Representative Expresses Optimism About the Future

Brussels – The Nine-Power Conference opened this morning. After Koo Vi Kyuin's speech, representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and Russia spoke successively, all elaborating on the same principles: (1) implementation of international law; (2) the Far Eastern situation is related to both China and Japan and is a world problem, so direct negotiations are difficult to conduct; (3) if the principle of territorial integrity is not maintained, the world's trust in stability and security will be lost; and (4) change is not impossible, but it cannot be achieved by military force. It is said that the above-mentioned statement was agreed upon by the representatives of the four countries in advance. No one understands the meaning of the phrase "change is not impossible," but according to rumors, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is specially leaving room for maneuvering for Japan here. Koo Vi Kyuin was quite optimistic after the adjournment. It is said that the principle of providing financial assistance to China while not sponsoring Japan has been agreed upon by all parties. The afternoon meeting will discuss this issue, as well as a declaration to the world that the Far Eastern issue is a world problem and that international conventions and the obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty should be respected. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference opened at 11:00 this morning to discuss a declaration explaining the Sino-Japanese conflict, which has been agreed upon in principle by the governments of Britain, France, Belgium, and the United States. The declaration not only explains the nature of the conflict but also makes a firm conclusion, morally condemning Japan and reaffirming Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the declaration is not accompanied by a resolution and will likely have to wait until after the adjournment. The date of the adjournment is expected to be decided today. Furthermore, the publication of the declaration will probably have to go through a difficult period because Italy is likely unwilling to participate in the condemnation of Japan, and a few small countries may also hesitate. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to continue this afternoon to discuss the declaration drafted by the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France on the Sino-Japanese dispute. Afterwards, British Foreign Secretary Eden will take a plane back to London tomorrow morning. Eden does not plan to attend if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference holds a plenary session on Monday (the 15th). At that time, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Malcolm MacDonald, will act as the chief representative of the United Kingdom. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

Brussels – After Japan's second refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it is generally believed that the door to continued negotiations with the Japanese government, other than discussing according to the conditions put forward by Japan itself, has been completely closed. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is now scheduled to discuss Japan's reply in private today, hoping to formulate a memorandum outlining the truth of the Sino-Japanese War. A public meeting may be held this morning or afternoon to pass it. British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Chief Representative Davis are expected to deliver important speeches at that time, and representatives from the British Dominions may also make statements. The conference may be adjourned after today's meeting to allow the representatives to consult with their home governments. Previously, after learning that the Japanese government had rejected the second petition, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference originally planned to make a final appeal to Tokyo, but after Eden consulted with the representatives, he felt that the wording of Japan's reply was firm, and it would be superfluous to continue to apply, so this proposal was abandoned. The method of mediation has been exhausted, and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is quite tricky. This difficulty has been lurking behind the scenes since the beginning of the conference. The response to the excellent situation is now awaiting Washington's actions. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference considered Japan's reply refusing to attend the conference to be within expectations and has made preparations in advance. At 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, representatives of the major countries have drafted a declaration summarizing the Nine-Power Treaty Conference's repeated efforts to persuade Japan to consult with the countries concerned to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict. This document will be sent to Japan after it is passed by the Assembly, because Japan is also a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty. U.S. Chief Representative Davis, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and French Foreign Minister Talbot all believe that sending a final application to Japan is "unhelpful and a formality." As for the second step, all countries are following the lead of the United States, because Britain, France, Russia, and other countries are unwilling to act on their own without the help of the United States. (National Telegram on the 13th)

Brussels – U.S. Chief Representative Davis recently held lengthy discussions with British Chief Representative, Foreign Secretary Eden, regarding the situation created by Japan's second reply, and is scheduled to consult with French Chief Representative, Foreign Minister Talbot, and Chinese Chief Representative, Ambassador to France Koo Vi Kyuin, this afternoon. It is generally believed that the wording of Japan's second reply is so firm that Davis's proposal to submit another application to Japan should be abandoned. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 12th)

[New York] Regarding Japan's second refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the New York Times recently commented that only two paths can be followed from now on: one is that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference declares an adjournment and the related countries handle it separately; the other is that the conference continues and the participating countries discuss their respective responsibilities under the Nine-Power Treaty. If the related countries adopt the first approach, it is tantamount to abandoning the principle of collective security and acknowledging that the Nine-Power Treaty has become a mere formality. Japan may want to regard it as waste paper, but the related countries, in consideration of the remnants of the principle of collective security, are unwilling to acquiesce. "If the U.S. delegation advocates continuing the conference at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the U.S. government will definitely give it strong support."

Boston – Today, two Japanese pilots who took photos of the Leckington Gate fortress in the northeast port of Boston were arrested by the Massachusetts police and then temporarily released. However, whether or not to summon them will be determined after the photographic negatives have been examined. (National Telegram on the 12th)

### Atmosphere of Mediation Is Unpredictable

The U.S. Immediately Denies Separate Mediation; Italy Suddenly Volunteers

[Washington] Reports from Brussels that a path for the United States and Japan to discuss the overall situation in the Far East outside the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is still open. Secretary of State Hull today declined to comment on this. The responsible authorities also have no signs of the United States considering acting alone. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

[Washington] Regarding the claim that the United States is mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute, U.S. officials recently stated that this is not possible. If the United States were to take such action, all countries with interests in the Far East must cooperate with it fully, which is the proper way. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

Brussels – Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, there was a rumor in the United States that representatives of the Japanese government had proposed in Beijing that the United States mediate. This has been denied by the Japanese embassy in Belgium. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

[Rome] Diplomatic circles recently stated that the Italian government intends to propose to the governments of China and Japan that they be allowed to mediate the current dispute. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

[Rome] Japanese Ambassador to Italy Horita had a long talk with Foreign Minister Count Ciano yesterday. According to Italian diplomatic circles, after Japan firmly refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Beijing Conference has failed. Horita and Ciano discussed matters related to this. Diplomatic circles also believe that the Italian government is showing its willingness to intervene and act as a mediator in the Sino-Japanese conflict. Regarding this, well-informed sources believe that Prime Minister Mussolini published an article in an Italian newspaper in 1934, which stated, "It is possible for China and Japan to reach an agreement, and at the same time, for the Sino-Japanese group to reach an agreement with European countries." According to Mussolini's usual claim, among the European countries, Italy is the ideal mediator of Eastern and Western civilization in terms of traditional relations. In the heyday of the Roman Empire, it took on this difficult and extremely important task, and it is still the same today. Therefore, well-informed sources believe that Italy has the possibility of jointly serving as a mediator in the Far East with Germany. Firstly, the trade agreement between Italy and Japan has not yet been signed, and secondly, Italy has always maintained good relations with China. In addition, it is generally believed that the Italian government is considering implementing economic cooperation between China, Japan, Germany, and Italy.

### Japanese-Russian Relations

Germany Speculates a Lot

[Berlin] Yesterday, the "People's Observer" newspaper, the organ of the National Socialist Party, quoted a report from its correspondent stationed in the Far East, saying that the progress of the war in China is quite unfavorable to the Japanese army. "If the Soviet Union assists the Chinese army from Outer Mongolia, it will be enough to hinder the advance of the Japanese army and can take action on the border of Manchuria," giving Japan great restraint. If this Soviet plan comes to fruition, then Outer Mongolia should be given assistance by the Soviet Union and become an area of ​​operation against Japan. "It seems that the success or failure of the Japanese army lies in whether the country can quickly end the military operations, so as to prevent the scope of the war, do not let it expand." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

[Moscow] According to news received here, the reaction to the Sino-Japanese conflict in eastern Siberia has increased unabated. The West Siberian Railway has been placed under the control of the People's Commissariat of Defense. After the Defense Committee took over the management of the road, the first order was to stop all normal passenger trains, because the road has been completely sealed for the transportation of troops and military supplies. All railway bridges east of Krasnoyarsk are closely guarded by the military to prevent all sabotage attempts. (Haitong Telegram on the 12th)

### British Diplomacy Actively Pursuing in Europe

Advancing Separately Towards Germany and Italy, King Leopold's Visit to England is Also Important

[London] Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, is scheduled to visit Berlin in the middle of next week to meet with key figures in the German political world. Foreign Secretary Eden, upon his return from Brussels the day after tomorrow, will meet with Lord Halifax early next week to consult on the talks to be held in Germany. Diplomatic sources emphasize that Halifax does not intend to hold formal negotiations with German political figures, but merely to exchange views. As for Halifax or Eden visiting Rome, or Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visiting London, such visits are not currently being considered. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)

[London] Regarding Lord Halifax's trip to Berlin, British diplomatic sources have stated that the purpose of this trip is to ascertain the German authorities' true views on various international issues, but it does not represent the British government putting forward any concrete proposals. Observers say that German leader Hitler will discuss the issue of Central Europe with Lord Halifax, especially the issue of the union between Germany and Austria. On this matter, the British government has not yet determined its attitude. Austrian figures here are concerned because a section of British public opinion supports holding a referendum in Austria to gauge public sentiment. As for the issue of Central Europe, Britain will definitely insist on maintaining the territorial integrity of Czechoslovakia. Lord Halifax may advise leader Hitler to sign a non-aggression treaty with Czechoslovakia. Once this is achieved, the door to a Western European pact will open. The main points of this pact would include returning several former colonies to Germany and having the country rejoin the League of Nations. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)

[Rome] Regarding British Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth's recent talks with Foreign Minister Ciano, Italian political figures have issued a warning, saying that although the two sides have begun contact through diplomatic channels, these talks are of a preliminary nature, focusing on exploring the necessary conditions for mutual rapprochement and should not be viewed with undue optimism. Furthermore, the tone of Italian newspapers is also very cautious. The semi-official Italian newspaper, Il Popolo d'Italia, stated that these talks were initiated by Britain. It is said that the semi-official newspapers of that country say that Italy initiated the talks to benefit that country. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)

[London] Regarding King Leopold III of Belgium's visit to England, the Liberal Party's "Star" newspaper recently reported that the Belgian King's visit is likely aimed at facilitating a Western European pact to replace the Locarno Treaty, and to enable cooperation between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. Lord Halifax, the British Lord Privy Seal, is scheduled to visit Berlin within the next week and hold talks with German authorities. The outcome of the Belgian King's visit should become clear before Lord Halifax sets off, and the British government can promptly give the necessary instructions to Lord Halifax. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)

[London] Regarding Lord Halifax's visit to Germany, today, all newspapers except the "Daily Worker" have given it positive reviews. All newspapers emphasize that Halifax's visit will promote understanding between the British and German people and contribute to peace. The "Times" stated that removing misunderstandings and building consensus is beneficial for both countries and that now is the time. The "Daily Mail" stated that Halifax's visit marks the beginning of a new era in British-German relations. The "News Chronicle" declared that if Britain and Germany can reach a lasting agreement on various disputed issues, it would be a most welcome development. According to announcements here, Halifax will meet with Foreign Secretary Eden once in the next term before departing on Wednesday or Thursday. It is said that issues such as the colonial question, the situation in the Far East, and the Spanish conflict will be touched upon during Halifax's meeting with the German leader. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

[Berlin] Local newspapers today published the news of British Lord Privy Seal Halifax's visit to Germany next week with large headlines, emphasizing the importance of this move. The semi-official "Deutsche Nachrichten" stated that Germany would welcome the opportunity for leader Hitler to meet with Halifax during his visit to Berlin to attend the International Hunting Exhibition because the principle of German foreign policy is to seize every opportunity to exchange views with European politicians, gain understanding, and enhance the work of maintaining peace.

### U.S. Fleet Commander-in-Chief Condemns Indiscriminate Bombing

Destruction of Property, Injury to Civilians, Violation of Public Law, Increasing Enmity

The "North-China Daily News" reported that when the Shanghai British Air Force Association held its weekly dinner yesterday, U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Yarnell and several officers were also among the guests. Admiral Yarnell delivered an impromptu speech, saying that he was deeply saddened to see such significant destruction in Shanghai and the surrounding areas during this war. He does not know when mankind will realize the proper use of aircraft. War, like any other activity, has rules. It is heartbreaking to witness the wanton destruction of property, injury to the lives of non-combatants, and the suffering of non-combatants in Shanghai. The rules of war must be observed, and indiscriminate bombing should be avoided. He believes that dropping bombs from airplanes is not as important in war as people imagine. It not only fails to weaken the enemy's resistance but also strengthens it. Wanton destruction of property and injury to non-combatants are ineffective. All countries should now realize that the effectiveness of aviation lies in many areas, not just in causing great destruction during wartime.

### Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun

Says Reuters Spreads Rumors

[Tokyo] The Tokyo "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an editorial today stating, "General Matsui has indicated to Britain a path to retirement." It is reported that General Matsui, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Shanghai, made a statement to foreign journalists on the 11th of this month, taking a very tough stance and openly criticizing the concession authorities for allegedly favoring China, stating that cooperation would no longer be possible. Today, the "Yomiuri Shimbun" regarded the above statement as clear and pleasant, "giving a blow to the head to those who are secretly acting ambiguous." The newspaper further stated that the blow that Shanghai's fall gave to Britain was greater than the attacks by submarines in the Mediterranean, "because the rumors created by China and Britain, which were spread by Reuters, will now be driven out of Shanghai along with the Chinese army. This is the end of news fabrication." (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### Our Troops Have Recaptured Fengjing and Jiashan

The Crisis at Wangjiangjing Has Also Been Lifted; Rumors that Songjiang Fell on the 9th

Central News Agency reports: According to military sources, the enemy landed at Quan Gongting, Jinshanwei, and other locations, fiercely attacking Zhangyan, Xincang, and Jinshan. Their momentum was fierce. Our small number of garrison troops and militia bravely resisted, making heroic sacrifices. Consequently, each location fell into enemy hands. After a minor victory, the enemy rashly advanced towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, catching us off guard, causing the Fengjing and Jiashan stations and Fengjing town to fall one after another. At this time, our main force had been mobilized to counterattack, and fierce fighting began. Our troops, without exception, fought one against a hundred, charging and killing until they finally repelled the enemy. By noon on the 12th, the Fengjing and Jiashan stations and Fengjing town had been completely recovered. However, there was still a force of enemy troops that had advanced towards Wangjiangjing along the Su-Jia Highway, once creating a dangerous situation. It was resolved by our fresh troops, but battles are still in progress.

Our left-wing positions are still firmly defending the line from Guangfu to Liuhe, and there have been no changes in the defenses north and south of Nanxiang to Huangdu. Although the enemy has been continuously advancing along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Shanghai-Nanda Highway in recent days, they have been repelled by our troops. However, on the right-wing side, we have abandoned Sijing town and are now firmly defending the south bank of the Sijing Pond and Wenguanbang outside the town along the Song-Si Highway, and have blown up the three stone bridges on the Bang. Qingpu, the central stronghold between the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, is still in our hands, but rumors state that Songjiang fell on the 9th. Around 9:00 AM yesterday, six enemy planes flew over Nanxiang, circling for several weeks before dropping more than a dozen bombs. Three bombs landed in Guyi Garden, and dozens of civilian houses were destroyed in places such as the Maojiawan Temple and other locations. Casualties are unknown. Central News Agency reports: According to military sources, enemy planes wreaked havoc in the Ningbo area the day before, with Ningbo, Kongpu, Baisha, and other locations being bombed, causing many civilian casualties. If the enemy attempts to land there, our troops are under strict vigilance.

### Enemy Troops Fleeing in Zhejiang Suffer Heavy Losses

Surrounded Remnants Attempt to Break Out Repeatedly Without Success; Two Enemy Warships Discovered in the Waters Off Haiyan

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 12th: Enemy troops fleeing in Zhejiang have suffered heavy losses after being severely suppressed by our forces from different directions. The surrounded remnants have repeatedly attempted to break out, but have not succeeded. Enemy warships along Hangzhou Bay are constantly shelling us, and we have returned fire, but we have suffered no losses. Also, on the 12th, two enemy warships were spotted in the waters off Haiyan, probing back and forth, but they did not dare to approach the land.

### Large Numbers of Enemy Warships Sail to the Waters Off Langshan and Fushan

And Many Small Boats Travel West Along the Suzhou Creek

Central News Agency reports: The number of enemy warships docked in the Huangpu River has decreased in recent days. According to investigations conducted yesterday, in addition to eight transport ships and one Red Cross ship, only three gunboats were recorded, docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf and the Pudong New Mitsui Wharf respectively. One destroyer was docked at the No. 1 buoy, two cruisers, one being the Izumo, were still docked at the No. 2 buoy, and one being the Taiyo, sailed to the No. 7 buoy after unloading enemy reinforcements at the Qiujiang Wharf. One torpedo ship was docked at the Pudong Merchants' Wharf. That makes a total of seven ships. It is said that most of the enemy warships originally docked in the Huangpu River, except for a part that sailed to Hangzhou Bay, have all sailed into the Yangtze River off Langshan and Fushan, with some intention.

Central News Agency reports: The enemy troops are actively invading westward. Yesterday, a large number of small motorboats, fully loaded with military equipment and supplies, sailed upstream along the Suzhou Creek. The creek has become an important route for their transportation and reinforcements.

### Blockade Line of the Huangpu River is Breached

One of Our Zhonghe Merchant Ships Was Also Dragged Out

The Huangpu River between Xiaodongmen, Shiliupu in Nanshi, and Laiyidu has been under blockade since the tank battle occurred as a precaution. Enemy warships have never been able to penetrate deeply. Now that Pudong and Nanshi have fallen successively, the enemy is trying to destroy the obstacles blocking the Huangpu River. It is now confirmed that a section along the Pudong side has already been destroyed. Yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, three enemy shallow-water warships, fully loaded with soldiers, sailed into the South Huangpu, but have not been seen leaving.

Central News Agency reports: With Pudong and Nanshi completely fallen into enemy hands, the blockade line at the Ning-Shao Wharf at Shiliupu has been destroyed. Several ships, including two municipal ferries, large sandboats, tugboats, and barges, originally docked in the Huangpu River, have been seized by the enemy. One Zhonghe merchant ship has been towed away, while the rest remain docked there, but all are flying the Rising Sun flag. One enemy warship, the one that shelled Nanshi a couple of days ago, along with several shallow-water warships and small boats, fully loaded with sailors and military equipment, sailed upstream yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM to reinforce various locations. The Ning-Shao Warehouses along the Huangpu River were heavily bombarded by the enemy, suffering countless wounds and severe damage. The banks of the Huangpu River and the river itself are piled with debris and are extremely chaotic. The bustling area has become a dead city, with only flocks of eagles hovering over the water.

The blockade line in front of the Ning-Shao Wharf at Shiliupu has been completely destroyed after Pudong and Nanshi fell completely into enemy hands. Our Zhonghe merchant ship, originally docked in the Huangpu River in Nanshi, was towed out by an enemy ship at dawn yesterday and is now docked at the No. 4 buoy across from the Wayside Wharf.

### Miscellaneous News from the War Zones in the Suburbs of Shanghai

Since the Shanghai battle began on August 13th, the confrontation in the Hongkou area lasted for seventy days, so the houses there suffered first. On the morning of the 27th of last month, Zhabei fell successively. Not long after, our troops in western Shanghai retreated to new positions. Recently, Pudong and southern Shanghai have fallen entirely into enemy hands, causing the valuable lands in the four suburbs of Shanghai to become scorched earth. Everywhere are broken walls and ruins. Refugees are crowded into the concessions, so within ten miles of the suburbs, death surrounds everything. Except for a few fierce thugs, wandering around the streets, there are no other human beings, and it has become a dead city.

Zhoupu Maintenance Committee in Pudong

After the fall of Zhoupu Town in Pudong, the enemy immediately occupied the town, stationed in various civilian houses, and tempted local people to come out and maintain order. The maintenance is currently being led by Zhang Xianzhou, an old baozheng (neighborhood head) who is almost seventy years old. He is using Hakka people to persuade local residents who have fled to return and make a living.

Residents of Western Shanghai Are Gradually Moving Back

Since our troops withdrew from western Shanghai last month, the areas along Avenue Joffre and Route Tenant de la Tour in western Shanghai have been close to the front lines, and stray bullets have been flying. Residents in the vicinity have moved south. Now that our troops have moved to defend Songjiang, the sounds of gunfire are no longer heard in the area. Generally, residents have gradually moved back, and a few shops have opened for business, but there are few pedestrians in the evening.

Kuang Hua University Burns Down Again

Kuang Hua University on Great Western Road caught fire from a shell on the night of the 12th.

As of 5:00 PM, the entire school was still burning.

Civilian Houses in the South Railway Station Area Are Completely Destroyed

Nine-Year-Old Girl Escapes with Younger Brother

Yesterday, a nine-year-old girl surnamed Liu was crying in front of the iron gate of the Old North Gate, carrying her three-year-old younger brother. She said that her father's name was Liu Zhenshan, and he ran a shop in Rihui Port. When the enemy invaded, her parents were separated in the chaos, so she carried her three-year-old younger brother and fled here. She had been without food for two days. She said that her older sister married a husband who owned a shoe store at the French Concession Grand Clock, and fortunately, she had seven yuan in New Year's money, so she did not starve. She said that if she could meet her older sister and she could support her for three years, she could work to raise her younger brother. Those who heard it could not help but feel sad. It was later learned that the girl had been taken into the concession.

Fire in Pudong Destroys Thousands of Houses

Fires in Pudong have been raging for days, destroying countless civilian houses.

### Stirling Fessenden of the Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Maintaining Administrative Power in the Concession

No Changes in Political and Legal Aspects; Japan Has No Reason to Interfere in the Administration of the Concession

The "Shanghai Times" reported that Stirling Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, gave an interview to a "Times" reporter on the 12th, saying that he believes the Council will adopt a trouble-shooting policy regarding areas of the Shanghai Concession that have been occupied by Japanese military forces. According to Mr. Fessenden, although the Japanese army has occupied parts of Shanghai, it is unlikely to attempt to interfere in the Council's administration. Mr. Fessenden continued, saying that the Council is now doing its best to maintain a neutral attitude. We will do our best to bring extremist groups, especially those involved in posting anti-Japanese leaflets, into line. When the reporter asked if the Council would inspect newspapers, Mr. Fessenden said that this had not yet been implemented, but that perhaps it would be pursued. It would be best if newspapers could show a greater degree of self-control. The reporter also asked what impact a declaration of war between China and Japan would have on the Concession. Mr. Fessenden replied that this was an international rather than a purely local issue. Under the current circumstances, Japan has no reason to interfere in the administration of the Council. Mr. Fessenden continued, answering another question from the reporter, saying that the customs issue mentioned by Matsui in his statement on the 11th has no direct relationship with the Council. Mr. Fessenden also said that with refugees now flocking into the Concession, the issue of defense within the Concession has been re-arranged. The Council has always been able to maintain order and security within the Concession in the past, and there is no reason why it should not be able to continue to do so this time. As for Matsui's statement expressing that the Concession has not fully cooperated in the past, he cannot agree. We have very little friction with the Japanese. Whenever problems have arisen in the past, we have negotiated with them in a frank manner and dealt with them in the most expeditious way. Once the situation clears up, there is no reason why the Council cannot assume management of the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. Mr. Fessenden concluded, saying that in political and legal aspects, the Concession remains unchanged from the past.

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Council Director Fessenden declared that the Council is doing everything in its power to maintain a neutral attitude. Mr. Fessenden's intention is that the Japanese side does not intend to interfere in the internal administration of the Council. The Council has no disagreements with the Japanese side.

The "North-China Daily News" published a short commentary yesterday, stating that General Matsui's talk with several foreign news agency interviewers on November 11th seemed to stir up ripples in a calm lake. The full text of his talk is available, but the "North-China Daily News" has some doubts about its accuracy, so it was not published in the newspaper. At the same time, rumors suddenly arose, causing the general public to have some doubts about Matsui's intentions towards the Public Concession. Matsui can, as usual, express his opinions or wishes to the responsible authorities here. As for the remarks made to reporters, this is clearly not the way to go. It can be imagined that Matsui has methods to make necessary contact with responsible authorities. It can also be imagined that Matsui is well aware of the status of the Concession and all the interests it represents. Washington or London have certainly made no indication that they intend to distrust the ordinary diplomatic methods of ascertaining their opinions, and there is no shortage of signs of readiness to cooperate with them to meet the difficult situation. Unless an event of a truly responsible nature occurs, the prudent do not wish to be disturbed by busybodies and engage in idle talk.

### A Refugee from Tianmashan Talks About the Hardships and Dangers Encountered Along the Way

The roads are rugged, women and children are separated, bandits and ruffians openly rob people.

According to a relative and friend who had just escaped from Tianmashan, Songjiang, to Shanghai last night, after learning on the morning of the 5th that Jinshanwei and Quanyigting had been landed by enemy troops, they saw countless men and women who had fled from Songjiang to Songyin, Yexie, Zhangyan, and other places in the past fleeing back from Songyin and other places to Songjiang. However, due to the dense bombing by enemy aircraft and the fierce artillery fire and flying bullets, they could not live in peace, and it was impossible to even cook a meal. Looking into the distance, none of the houses in the streets and alleys remained intact. Therefore, the men, women, old, and young who still intended to stay in Songjiang had no choice but to abandon their homes and flee in a panic to the villages of Hengshan, Tianmashan, and other places northwest of Songjiang. At that time, all the boats were impossible to hire, so they only took one or two small bags and walked on foot. The roads they traveled were rugged. Moreover, women in the interior were not good at walking, so they fell dozens of times along the way. The cries of sorrow and the cries of hungry children startled the four fields, which was unbearable to hear. Considering the danger to their lives, even though they were exhausted, they still had to bravely run. Many were separated along the way. Unexpectedly, after just ten miles or so, they encountered dozens of hooligans who swept away all the cash and one or two pieces of jewelry that ordinary people had. At that time, although everyone wanted to take back this only second lifeline, they could not match their weapons, so they had to endure the pain and tears and watch these beasts without conscience take them away. Running for their lives, misfortunes never come singly. After experiencing thousands of hardships and being frightened, they fortunately reached their destination, but the second storm arose. Dozens of bandits openly robbed, entered the house and confiscated all the remaining clothes and bags. Therefore, they had nothing left but their own bodies. However, the beasts were not satisfied and appeared in the countryside all day long, causing panic several times a day, and they could not stay temporarily. They fled to Sheshan again, but that place was not safe either. At the same time, the food was completely cut off, and they had not eaten rice or water for a day and a night. Adults could still endure it, but how could children endure hunger for long? Therefore, they looked for food nearby. Fortunately, the villagers were kind and helped them, so they could fill their children's stomachs, mustered their remaining strength, and turned east. After three days and two nights of running and searching by enemy soldiers, they managed to escape death and reach Shanghai, but they were alone, pale, haggard, and almost dead. Recalling the experience, they were still frightened.

### Living Hell on Earth

— Huai Qing

Countless refugees thronged on MinGuo Road, facing every iron gate of the segregated settlements, uttering faint, tragic, heart-rending sighs! This is no longer a road; it is people, the soul of all things, flesh and blood bodies, filling the "road of flesh"!

They gazed at the settlements... tall buildings, cars speeding by... still living safely. They imagined the settlements... cinemas, theaters, restaurants, dance halls... still brightly lit, decadent and extravagant, worthy of a prosperous city!

A line of separation; one side is paradise, the other is hell. The people in hell are starving and freezing, crying out for food, dreaming of paradise every day; but the people in paradise never think about the people struggling on the starvation line!

The fallen Shanghai is still, especially, showing such extreme injustice!

Death is making its last stand, yearning for rational human beings to provide relief every day!

They have lost their human nature! They are doubting "man"—is so-called rational humanity so cruel?

The people in hell no longer have class, no longer have rich or poor, everything is equal!

Iron gates—they are gazing at the iron gates at all times with their last breath, and the iron gates are always severely blocking the two extremely unfair worlds!

The iron gate suddenly opened, and the starving people, no, the crazy starving mob who had lost their human consciousness, rushed towards the settlement like the Yellow River bursting its banks. They forgot that they had not eaten for three days, and with their exhausted bodies, they charged! Charged! Charging towards the settlement! Cruel wooden sticks were wielded with force in the hands of "men," hitting heavily, heavily on the heads of another kind of human, hitting incessantly! Skulls were shattered, blood flowed! The people in front fell to the ground, but the people behind couldn't care, they just stepped over their bodies, stepped over them; charge! Charge! Charging towards the settlement!

The iron gate suddenly closed again! Some luckily rushed into the settlement, and the unfortunate ones fell back into hell! But those who rushed into the settlement still did not find their paradise; paradise was not theirs, and they were still struggling on the starvation line!

There is no water, no rice in hell. If someone brought rice, if they accidentally spilled a drop of water, they would use the toilet as fuel to cook the rice, and would not allow you to enjoy it alone. The vendors at the iron gate sell a small cake for a hundred coins, and it is immediately snatched away.

Kind people lower buckets of water from the roofs of nearby houses, but in the fierce competition of tens of millions of starving people, the result is that the water is spilled all over the ground, and they still cannot relieve the people fighting with death!

Cakes are thrown from the rooftops, grab! Grab! Those who grab it can barely fill a corner of their stomachs and maintain some life.

There was a young man in a Western suit with a modern woman—they looked like a modern young couple, but now they had also become starving people waiting for food on the starvation line. —He cleverly used his felt hat as a net to catch the cakes thrown down from the roof; but as soon as the cake fell into the felt hat, it was immediately snatched away by thousands of hands, and even the felt hat was snatched away.

A poor old woman in her sixties, she no longer had the bravery of youth; she couldn't grab it, she looked longingly and cried weakly, asking the distributors on the roof to throw a few to her. She held her pockets with both hands, waiting, waiting; sure enough, soon four or five cakes fell into her pockets, but before she could express her joy, she was snatched away by a gang of hungry tigers and wolves, and she was pushed to the ground, trampled on by others. She only had a last, faint breath left!

A tragically inhuman living hell!

The fallen Shanghai shows such extreme injustice!

Although the rumor that enemy troops had landed at Guanhaiwei was not confirmed, many enemy ships were anchored there and constantly harassed various ports. The Ningbo River is the main waterway in eastern Zhejiang. After the start of the Shanghai war, the port was sealed off, but merchant ships could still enter and exit. It is now learned that in order to strengthen the defense of the port, the military authorities completely sealed it off yesterday. Merchant ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo can dock outside the port, so passengers can still enter and exit, but cargo transportation is inconvenient. A notice has been issued to stop loading goods. The Ende Wheel, which departed for Ningbo yesterday afternoon, received a telegram and unloaded all the loaded goods, but the passengers were very crowded. (Central News Agency)

However, enemy soldiers are searching around the area, near Rue de la Republique, and the sound of gunfire is often heard, inevitably causing anxiety among the refugees. But the enemy soldiers have not entered the area, and the iron gates along Rue de la Republique bordering the French Concession remain closed. Merchants and residents of the southern part of Nanshi have gathered there, making the area increasingly crowded. Father Jacquinot's office within the area is equipped with a telephone, directly connected to the French police station, allowing him to contact the French authorities at any time. Therefore, an agreement has been reached with the French authorities that all donations will be collected at the International Relief Committee and transported twice daily, at 10 AM and 2 PM. The French police will send personnel to pass through the French military defense line at the border between the Chinese and French territories, and then Father Jacquinot will send personnel to transport them into the city. Father Jacquinot has been instrumental in planning the relief efforts for the refugees. He was once hit by a stray bullet during the fierce fighting between the Japanese and our isolated army a few days ago. The detectives accompanying him were killed, but Father Jacquinot was unharmed, only his trousers were hit. He is currently working with five foreigners who initiated the refugee area, personally overseeing the refugee relief efforts at the Catholic Church in Nanshi, and has expressed his determination to live and die with the refugee area. The committee sent three truckloads of supplies twice yesterday, at 8 AM and 2:30 PM. At the same time, Guanshengyuan also sent a large batch of food. Many individuals and organizations, concerned about the displaced in the area, have voluntarily purchased food and entrusted the committee to deliver it.

Red Cross Relief Efforts Continue

The Red Cross relief team, seeing the refugees crowded on Rue de la Republique in Nanshi, suffering from hunger and cold, has been taking care of them day and night under the leadership of the team leader and staff. They are also distributing steamed buns daily. It is reported that the team managed to rescue over five hundred and sixty women and children last night, sending them to a safe location. They also found more than a dozen empty houses on Fuyou Road and Rue de la Republique to accommodate some of the refugees. They also rescued fourteen wounded civilians and sent them to the Fourth Hospital of the association for treatment, and distributed over ten thousand steamed buns. They also distributed hundreds of thousands of cakes and pastries on behalf of various groups, shops, and residents to Wanzhu Elementary School, the City God Temple, and various streets, and added tea barrels in various places, which helped the refugees alleviate their suffering to some extent.

The North-China Daily News reports that the management committee of the special refugee area in Nanshi reported yesterday that the Japanese army arrived at the boundary line of the area at 10:25 AM. The entire area was quiet, and no accidents occurred. All three parties supporting the plan have fulfilled the agreed conditions, so a large part of Nanshi has been spared from attack and fire, and the civilians who have taken refuge in the area are safe.

The China Press reports that a Japanese spokesperson told reporters this morning (13th) that the Japanese military police may occasionally enter the Nanshi refugee safety zone to patrol, but the Japanese soldiers have not penetrated the boundary line. The Japanese authorities previously stated that when the Japanese army captured Nanshi, they intended to occupy the area. Regarding this matter, negotiations are currently underway with the management committee of the area, and no concrete decision has been made. However, the disposal of this part is currently under special consideration. The China Press has learned that a small number of Japanese soldiers entered the area yesterday, but immediately withdrew after explaining the nature of the area. It is not certain whether there were any more entrants this morning. All parties related to the area, namely China, Japan, and the International Red Cross, are fulfilling all the conditions set. What cannot be decided at present is when the Japanese side will begin to demand full management of the area.

Pastor Initiates Mutual Assistance in Times of Trouble

Pastor Cai Jixiang and Taoist Zhao Tianyong of the Ninth Refugee Shelter of the Shanghai Christian Federation have initiated a good deed of refugees helping refugees. In addition to the refugees in the shelter voluntarily donating and eating only vegetables for one day, Taoist men and women such as Qi Jiliang, Wan Chuanzhen, Gu Enlan, and Pu Xiuying have been collecting donations along the way, and using all the money to buy steamed buns, which they personally distribute to the refugee area. The spirit of refugees helping refugees, as demonstrated by these Christians, is truly commendable.

### Christian Organizations Make Efforts in Relief Work

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Christian organizations and groups in this city have been dedicated to the relief of refugees. The National Christian Council of China, the Shanghai Christian Federation, the National Committee of the YMCA, the Evangelical Federation, and other groups have been promoting joint prayer for peace and convening individual and joint meetings to discuss relief issues. It has been found that in addition to a few social groups taking on the responsibility for relief work in this city, most of it is handled independently or jointly by these organizations. Currently, the largest relief organizations and methods include the relief committee of the National Christian Council of China, the Refugee Tuberculosis Sanatorium, the Shanghai Christian Wartime Service Corps, the YMCA's military service work, and the Shanghai Christian Federation's refugee shelters, which once accommodated more than three thousand six hundred refugees, and still house more than two thousand. The National YMCA and the YWCA jointly handle national student relief matters, while other relief work is carried out in conjunction with various church groups. The Shanghai YMCA has recently been promoting the "Return to Hometown Production Movement" in response to the increasing unemployment and the urgent need for production. The YWCA has recently established a "Unemployed Women's Training Center" to help female compatriots who have suffered. As for other smaller church groups, they are also making their own efforts in relief work.

### YMCA Strengthens Children's Understanding of the Savings Movement

First Report of Results Held Yesterday

The YMCA held its first report of results on national salvation savings in the conference room on the third floor at 2 PM yesterday. More than 50 captains attended. Chen Yisheng first reported that since the association promoted national salvation savings, the number of teams established has exceeded 100, with 1,295 depositors and savings of 3,154 yuan, 9 jiao, and 5 fen. Afterwards, it was discussed that education should be the purpose in the future, reaching deeply into the children's teams, strengthening the children's understanding of national salvation savings, and each captain should be responsible for the children, in order to achieve universality. Finally, there was entertainment, and the meeting ended at 5 PM.

### Shop Assistant Serves on the Front Lines and Uses Savings Book to Purchase Bonds

Duan Jintang is a Model Youth

Duan Jintang, a shop assistant at the Meichang Hardware Store in this city, is a passionate youth. After the August 13th incident, he bravely served on the front lines. Now, he has also handed over his savings book No. 317 at the Transportation Bank, totaling 100 national currency, and his father, Duan Guangqian's, Shanghai Kenye Bank savings book with 60 yuan, to the First Special District Group to purchase public bonds. His patriotism is truly admirable.

### Compatriots from Sijing in Shanghai Form a Refugee Association

Association Address Temporarily Located on Avenue Edward VII. Displaced Compatriots Should Register Quickly.

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Sijing has fallen into the war zone, and no less than several thousand people have come to Shanghai to take refuge. However, they are scattered in various places, making it difficult to contact each other. Now, fellow Sijing countrymen Yao Tingguang, Cao Jinren, Tao Huian, etc., in order to facilitate contact and mutual assistance, have organized a refugee association. The association address is temporarily located inside the Changshun business in Songjiang Lane behind the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Displaced fellow countrymen can go there to register for contact and planning for the aftermath.

### Situation of the French Waterworks in Nanshi

Fortunately Not Affected by Shrapnel, etc. Sufficient Food Supply, No Shortage Worries.

The Continental Daily News reports that it was learned yesterday (12th) that the French waterworks in Nanshi's Jiangbin area were not hit by bombs, shells, or fragments during the outbreak of the war in Nanshi. The forty Chinese and foreign nuns in the poor little sisters' convent are housing about 500 refugees in the convent, and they are also safe. It is still impossible to enter the area, but according to the French authorities, both places have a sufficient food supply and there is no need to worry about shortages. There are foreign engineers and 40 French soldiers stationed in the waterworks.

### Recent Situation of the Military Hospital

Xinhua Yuye Expands and Arranges, YMCA Seeks Items

The International Fifth Military Hospital, hosted by the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city at the original site of the former Dalu Ballroom on Ningbo Road, has admitted 177 wounded soldiers in recent days. The internal layout has been carefully planned by colleagues in the new pharmaceutical industry and is extremely well-prepared. Doctors and nurses have been selected for their knowledge and experience. The supply of medicines and equipment has been fully provided by colleagues in the industry. Currently, the entire second floor of the hospital is not enough, so the third floor is being cleaned and expanded. The entire hospital is taken care of by 30 members of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps, and the order is well-maintained. The Shanghai YMCA has always been committed to serving the community. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, it has been working hard to provide education, entertainment, and condolences to the wounded soldiers. In the past month, it has established a wounded soldiers' club in the 23rd Rescue Hospital, which has greatly boosted the morale of the wounded soldiers and is very helpful for the management of the hospital. Currently, the hospital's wounded soldiers receive a lot of mail every day, with postage of three yuan each time, requiring about ninety yuan per month. It is hoped that people in society will donate, no matter how small. In addition, the hospital's wounded soldiers' club needs: ㊀ two radios, ㊁ gramophones and records, ㊂ books and magazines. Donations of cash and items can be sent directly to the YMCA at Baxianqiao.

Special Commentary

### It's Everyone's Business

— Feng Lieshan

Since the launch of this all-out war of resistance, one thing that we feel is gratifying is that international opinion has a considerable understanding of the Far East issue, unlike in the past when everyone was blindly deceived by the Japanese. For example, two months ago, the London News Review (a British Liberal Party newspaper) had an editorial that argued that there has never been such a precedent in world history, that when two countries are at war, all neutral people in the world completely sympathize with one side, as everyone sympathizes with China this time. This can very well represent the correct view of the international public opinion circles on the Sino-Japanese issue a month ago. Of course, we admire these people who love the truth, but purely this kind of passive sympathy, in fact, absolutely cannot stop Japan's aggressive actions and save the current crisis of world peace and human culture. Democratic political system countries, especially the United Kingdom and the United States, still do not have a new understanding to this day, and they still mistakenly regard the Sino-Japanese War as the business of the Chinese, as a Far East issue rather than a world issue, as in the past. If Japan's military policy succeeds, using China's manpower and financial resources as the foundation to prepare for her dream of ruling the world, everyone will understand the significance of our war of resistance this time. However, that may be too late!

The current Sino-Japanese War is not just our Chinese business, but everyone's business, it is a world problem. If Japan achieves her aggressive goals this time, not only will the commercial interests of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East be fundamentally shaken, (the facts of the four eastern provinces are an example), not only will the South Pacific Islands, Australia, India, and Siberia become the objects of Japan's covetousness, but more importantly, some countries will see that Japan's adventurous policy may once again hope for success, thus further increasing their arrogance. If this is the case, what are we still talking about world peace? Can countries with democratic political systems say that all of this is only China's business and has nothing to do with everyone else? In fact, sacrificing China will not only not bring world peace, but on the contrary, it will only increase the ambitions of aggressors. The international community will only have more troubles from then on. Democratic political system countries want to avoid disputes, but the result is probably still creating disputes!

Not only for justice or humanity, people in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries should not sit idly by in the Sino-Japanese War. More importantly, our fates are originally inseparable. To talk about security, the prerequisite is that everyone gets security. That is why we fully agree with President Roosevelt's views. If peace-loving countries do not unite, how can we save the current crisis? Unfortunately, this war first broke out in China, and the Chinese people are being sacrificed, but for the survival of our nation and for world peace, we are willing to use our blood to reduce future human warfare. Our war of resistance this time is a test of future world peace or war. A Chinese victory will not only guarantee peace in the Far East, but may even prevent the outbreak of a future world war!

We can understand this difficulty of the status of democratic political system countries at present. However, we cannot help but feel somewhat disappointed by the diplomatic policies that everyone has adopted over the years. The goal of democratic political system countries is to maintain the status quo, so everyone is trying to compromise everywhere. Unfortunately, this predicament has become a weakness in the eyes of the aggressor country, so they have the opportunity to move one step further. If Japan knew that the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, France, and other countries would not only adopt a passive policy of sympathizing with China on the Sino-Japanese issue, then she would not dare to take the risk this time, and the current war could at least be temporarily avoided. Secondly, everyone has misjudged the strength of China itself. China is not Abyssinia the second, this point should be recognized by democratic political system countries from the beginning. Perhaps at this time we alone do not have the strength to eliminate harm for everyone, but as long as the attitude of democratic political system countries is slightly more active, the Chinese people will not care about the price of sacrifice. Again, democratic political system countries are all suffering from a fear of Japan. In recent years, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have shown concessions everywhere to Japan's challenging actions. This is completely the face of a wealthy family encountering a rascal. In fact, Japan is only a second-rate military power. After several months of heroic resistance by the Chinese people, it has at least proved that Japan is definitely not that terrible. What the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries are worried about is that the matter will come to themselves. In fact, Japan is already finding it difficult to deal with China at this time, and has no energy to provoke others, even if her ambition is greater. And the longer the war is prolonged, the weaker Japan's strength will become. As long as China can continue to resist for one or two years, even her plan to invade the Asian continent will be shattered, and there will be no chance of biting others again. Perhaps democratic political system countries are using all kinds of efforts to maintain a neutral attitude at this time, just to leave themselves a way out, fearing that Japan will take retaliatory measures in the future. Regarding this point, everyone seems to be too unfamiliar with Japan's national conditions. As long as Japan has a day of success, will she still think of good faith or the friendly attitude of others?

The Chinese people do not have an excessive expectation of democratic political system countries. We know and can also understand the current difficult situation of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. We do not hope that everyone will use military pressure to solve the current Sino-Japanese war. However, there are many methods other than military pressure. Democratic political system countries understand where our needs are!

Originally, for a nation to survive, it still relies on its own struggle. The war of resistance in the past few months has proved that we have not forgotten this point. However, this Sino-Japanese war is related to everyone's fate and is not simply our Chinese business. Democratic political system countries do not seem to adopt the every-use-must-fail wait-and-see policy again. If everyone hopes to shed less blood in the future, then this is the last chance.

### French Mail Steamer Carries Overseas Chinese Compatriots Back Home Yesterday

A Total of Fifty-Three Men and Women, Welcomed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, etc.

The French mail steamer President Doumer set sail yesterday, carrying 53 overseas Chinese from Japan from Kobe. The details are as follows:

Arrived in Shanghai by Ship

The overseas Chinese who arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the President Doumer mail steamer boarded the ship in Kobe on the 10th of this month. They are from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Shandong, and other provinces, especially those from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. Therefore, Shao Yulin, our Consul General in Yokohama, specially prepared a letter to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, asking for their care. After the ship arrived, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau was informed and specially sent staff member Tan Zhonglu, together with Shao Xiangqing, a representative of the Ningbo Association, to the pier to welcome them. After the overseas Chinese landed, they were accompanied to the association for a short rest. Those from Ningbo were hosted by the association and arranged for accommodation. Those from Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, and Shandong were hosted and arranged for accommodation by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau.

Overseas Chinese Talk

According to the overseas Chinese, they have lived in Japan for many years and are engaged in various occupations such as Western clothing, catering, and employment. Almost all of them have brought their families. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, they have been stimulated by what they have seen and heard in Japan. They would rather give up the hard-earned foundation that they have been operating for many years in Japan and quietly return to their country.

Consul's Letter

The letter from our Consulate General in Yokohama to the Association reads: Now there are 53 overseas Chinese from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Yuan, and Shandong provinces, including Ding Changqi and others (list attached), men, women, and children, who have difficulty making a living due to various reasons. This consulate has provided assistance and sent them back to China, and has issued free train tickets and half-price ship tickets. I hereby inform you and ask you to check and take care of them so that these overseas Chinese can return to their hometowns. Your kindness is highly appreciated. It is noted on the list that those marked with the word "Zi" have their own funds for traveling to Shanghai. This is attached for your information. Sincerely, Shanghai Ningbo Association, Shao Yulin, Consul General in Yokohama, November 8.

Overseas Chinese Names

The names of the overseas Chinese are listed again: Ding Changqi, Lin Ayi, Wu Zhengmin, Lin Maozhen, Lin Weiji, Lin Shichun, Wei Fengsong, Wei Aixiang, Wei Taoxiang, Wei Guangxiong, Lin Yuanji, Wu Zhangrong, Wu Xiuying, Wu Fenglan, Wu Fenglian, Zhang Yixin, Zhang Youping, Zhang Yingming, Zhang Yifeng, Mrs. Xu Zhang, Xu Yueying, Zhu Songdu, Li Caisheng, Shen Xiaocheng, Zhang Ayun, Zhang Ahe, Zhang Hongrui, Dong Xinmao, Zhang Ruiying, Zhang Shinan, Mrs. Zhang He, Zhang Ayue, Zhang Caiyue, Meng Haishan, Sun Laifang, Wang Hongzhang, Lin Hongbin, Dong Lizhi, Zhao Guosen, Chen Zhiyuan, Li Fucun, Shi Yuxian, Mrs. Ge Shi, Zhang Yuying, Zhang Maolin, Zhang Shi, Zhang Genfa, Wu Ziqiang, Mrs. Zhang Lu, Zhang Cuishi, Chen Atang, Chen Shi, Lin Yuding, Lin Zhiyan.

### Order Gradually Restored in the Northern District of the Suzhou Creek Concession

Large Numbers of Refugees Sent to Shelters, Residents and Factories Gradually Returning

The area north of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, from North Jiangxi Road to North Xizang Road (the British military defense zone), has been extremely dangerous since the outbreak of the Shanghai war due to stray bullets flying around. Therefore, most of the residents, accounting for eight or nine out of ten, have moved to the area south of Suzhou Creek or the French Concession. Only the poor who are unable to move remain, making the area noticeably deserted. In order to maintain security, the police authorities have advanced the curfew to 6 PM and extinguished all the street lights north of Suzhou Creek, so the area is completely dark from 5 PM onwards. However, since our Zhabei garrison withdrew strategically on the 26th of last month, there is no longer any danger of stray bullets in the area, and the situation is gradually becoming safe. Trolleybuses on Line 6 have also resumed operation. The street lights on North Zhejiang Road, Qipu Road, and the alley lights in the alleys have also been completely turned on since the day before yesterday, except for the section north of Haining Road on North Zhejiang Road, which is still not turned on. Penglu Municipal Feihong Elementary School and the former Qunyi Girls' School at No. 920 Haining Road have been opened by the authorities as refugee shelters, and large numbers of refugees have been sent in recently. The number of residents returning is also increasing day by day. The problem is that the landlords in the area are unable to collect rent, so they have notified the water company to cut off the water supply. The water supply to the well-known Gaoshou Lane, both north and south, on Haining Road has also been cut off. Most of the residents are drawing water from the Suzhou Creek for use. Although the Chinese Ratepayers Association has issued a notice advising landlords to restore the water supply, this has not been implemented. It is said that the curfew time in the city in that area may be delayed due to the recent gradual stability, but it is still unknown whether it can be changed to the 11:30 PM curfew south of Suzhou Creek. The Dexing and Lixing Tobacco Companies, the Dadong Bookstore Main Factory, and other factories in the area have all resumed operations as usual.

### Rice Shops in the Public Concession Resumed Business Yesterday

Bureau of Public Works Sells Stored Grain at Fair Prices, Flour Sold Without Restrictions

After the various grain groups, such as the Bean and Rice Industry Association, Rice Shop Association, Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes Industry Association, and Flour Mill Industry Association, were ordered to regulate the food supply for Shanghai citizens, in addition to finding ways to clear sources and adjust prices, the Rice Shop Industry Association, with the consent of the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession, distributed the grain stored in the Bureau to member rice shops, a total of fifty, including Yuchengtai, to sell to the public at fair prices. The price of Saigon rice (i.e., foreign rice) was set at nine yuan per hundred jin. Retail sales at the door are limited to one yuan per person. Therefore, the rice shops in the concession that had temporarily suspended business due to the sale of stored rice have resumed business one after another yesterday. At the same time, they are also purchasing grain from various rice-producing areas and trying to transport it to Shanghai for regulation. Also, the amount of flour and wheat stored in Shanghai is very large. Rice shops that sell flour have been selling it without restrictions since yesterday, with a price of four yuan and five fen per bag. Since refugees have flocked to the concession in Shanghai and consumption has been enormous, all the stored rice in the retail rice shops had been sold out in the past few days. However, these were all purchased and stored by those with some assets, and the general poor people who seek a sheng of grain a day have not been able to obtain any food. In order to alleviate this panic, the Rice Shop Industry Association consulted with the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession to sell stored rice to the poor at retail prices, first dispatching fifty shops, limited to one yuan per person. The Shunfeng Rice Mill at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road is one of the fifty shops. Yesterday, the reporter visited and saw that after the mill opened a small door for sale at about 7 AM, the people gathered like ants. From the intersection of Changsha Road and Xinzha Road to Avenue Haig, a distance of about 300 yards, men, women, old and young, each holding lead buckets, wooden buckets, sacks, bamboo baskets, etc., scrambled to get ahead and were crowded like sardines. It was not until evening, when the mill stopped selling, that there were still hundreds of people who had not been able to buy it. The situation in other places can be imagined.

### North-China Daily News Reports on Terrible Fires in Western Shanghai

About Twenty Fires Break Out, Hopeful But Not Salvageable

The North-China Daily News reports that Guanghua University, a well-known educational institution in Shanghai, suddenly caught fire last night (12th). The university is located in the area occupied by the Japanese army near Zhongshan Road outside the Great Western Road. After the Shanghai Fire Department's observation post reported the fire, the Fire Department has not yet received a request for rescue, so it did not send a fire engine to rescue. At 6:30 PM, two houses were burning fiercely, and flames were shooting up from the windows on the top of the third house. The extent of the damage could not be ascertained last night, but according to the Fire Department's observation post, the fire was still not extinguished at 10:30 PM, so it is feared that the entire school has been reduced to ashes. According to residents in the western district yesterday, about twenty fires broke out outside the railway line in the afternoon, most of them being Chinese villages. At night, a huge building outside John University was blazing brightly, but it could not be identified as to what building it was.

### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Discusses Draft Declaration Condemning Japan, All National Representatives Express Approval, Italy Alone Voices Dissent to Protect Japan

⊙Brussels: Following the Japanese government's second refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the path of negotiation has been blocked. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference has therefore decided to issue a declaration concluding the Sino-Japanese dispute. The conference continued its meeting this afternoon to discuss the wording of the declaration. As a result, an outline was drafted based on the drafts submitted by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. A plenary session will be held on Monday (the 15th) to finalize and pass the full text of the declaration. (Central News Agency, Havana, 13th)

⊙Brussels: Today's Nine-Power Treaty Conference failed to pass a draft declaration strongly condemning Japan's refusal to attend the meeting due to Italy's strong opposition. However, after a lengthy and heated discussion, the representatives decided to submit the draft to their respective governments for review. The draft states that if Japan continues to refuse to participate in talks, the powers must consider what their common attitude should be. The final form of the declaration will be decided at the next meeting on Monday afternoon at 4 p.m. However, amendments can be submitted before the vote on that day.

The Italian representative, Marco di, stated in opposing the declaration that the Italian government wanted sufficient time to consider the draft. He believed that the Italian government should approve all or part of the declaration, and that the Japanese government should be asked to explain what it meant in its reply when it requested the Peking Conference to make contributions that were appropriate for the current situation.

The Chinese chief representative, Gu Weijun, opposed this proposal, saying that the conference urgently needed to proceed with its work and should not be further delayed. The representatives of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada also did not believe that Japan should be asked to explain its reply again. The representatives of Portugal, Mexico, and Australia then expressed their support for the declaration. The Dutch representative also expressed agreement, but with some modifications, although what he advocated was purely of a textual nature. The Portuguese representative fully endorsed the declaration, calling it a very insightful document. The Australian representative, Bruce, delivered a lengthy speech defending the democratic system and praising the U.S. Chief Representative Davis. After the Australian representative finished speaking, the conference discussed the declaration article by article. The general debate ended at 6:30 p.m.

Chairman Spaak then proposed to establish the declaration and then submit it to the respective governments for review, but the Italian representative opposed it, saying that it should only be submitted to the respective governments for review. After repeated discussions among the representatives present, they finally agreed to the Italian representative's suggestion and decided to send the draft to the governments of the countries participating in the Peking Conference. Before the adjournment, eleven countries approved the declaration, with only Italy holding a dissenting opinion. Chairman Spaak stated that he was confident that the declaration would be passed on Monday. The declaration is seven pages long and completely refutes the Japanese arguments, saying that Japan's views on the Sino-Japanese problem and its implications are completely contrary to the views of most other countries. The conference affirmed that the Sino-Japanese conflict is a matter of concern to all countries, whether they are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty or the Pact of Paris. The conference hoped that Japan would reconsider its decision to refuse to send representatives to the meeting. However, if Japan continues to refuse, the powers must consider what attitude they should adopt towards the fact that one signatory state wants to abolish treaty provisions that all signatory states recognize as effective. Japan claims that the current conflict is only related to China and Japan, but the members of the League of Nations have unanimously stated that they believe that the conflict is related to all signatory states of the League of Nations Covenant. The current hostile acts in the Far East have caused feelings of terror and resentment among the people of all countries and have caused feelings of anxiety around the world. The Japanese government said that it was China whose actions and attitudes violated the Nine-Power Treaty, but China is now engaged in a detailed and frank discussion of the incident, while Japan refuses to discuss the matter with any country. The representatives present at the meeting are convinced that direct negotiations between China and Japan cannot achieve a fair and lasting solution. A solution can only be successful if both sides agree to cease hostilities and consult with the representatives of the countries attending the Peking Conference. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 13th)

### Britain, America, Russia and France Jointly Assist China in Principle, Agreement Reached

⊙Brussels: According to well-informed sources here, regarding the section submitted by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France for review at next Monday's meeting, the conference only passed the diplomatic line adopted on the Far East issue without making any specific resolutions. All the details will be discussed jointly by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, which are most closely related to the Far East. So far, the consultations have clearly been beneficial to China, especially regarding the supply of arms and loans, the countries have reached agreement in principle. Each country will be responsible for its own actions in supporting China, but according to the French government's proposal, if such actions to help China cause any "unexpected events," the countries will take mutual assistance. It is said that the Soviet representative has expressed approval of this plan. (Haitong Electric, 13th)

### Panchen Lama Enters Kang

[Chongqing] It is determined that the Panchen Lama will enter Kang via Shiqu from Yushu today and temporarily reside in Garze. (Special Dispatch, 13th)

### Our Troops in Shanxi Province Will Launch Guerrilla Warfare, Attacking Enemy Flanks and Rear

[Beiping] According to reliable information from foreigners, part of the Chinese Eighth Route Army is still conducting guerrilla warfare behind Japanese troops in northeastern Shanxi Province. There are also troops from this army in northwestern and southeastern Shanxi Province. Although Taiyuan has fallen, it cannot be regarded as a failure of the entire Shanxi Province, because there are many Chinese troops scattered throughout the province, and the province is surrounded by mountains. In the future, the Chinese army can use the excellent terrain to attack the flanks and rear of the Japanese army, making the Japanese army exhausted. (Express News Agency Electric, 14th)

### Fierce Fighting in Northern Shandong, Enemy Launches Three-Pronged Attack in Linqu Area, Attempt to Invade Tuhai River Driven Back by Our Troops, Intense Fighting on Pinghan Railway Line as Well

[Jinan] The enemy in the Linqu area totals five to six thousand men, with more than 30 mountain and field guns and about 20 tanks. Since the morning of the 12th, they have launched a fierce enveloping attack on our positions in the Qingliangdian, Jiexuanzhuang, and Xiakouzhen areas in three directions. The fierce fighting is unprecedented since the start of the war in northern Shandong. Although the enemy relies on new weapons and acts recklessly, our soldiers are extremely excited. Therefore, during the fierce fighting, they fought bravely one after another, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat more than a dozen times. Our fresh troops have flown to reinforce. Also, the enemy on the railway front attempted to invade our Tuhai River with a combined force of about 1,300 to 1,400 infantry, cavalry, and tanks on the morning of the 12th. After our brave repulsion, they failed to succeed. The enemy then secretly moved westward at dawn on the 13th. Our army is on strict alert. (Central News Agency Electric, 13th)

[Jinan] The Jinpu war has gradually become tense since the 11th. The enemy has launched attacks on our entire line in multiple directions for several days. The Linqu area is even more fierce, but they have all been repelled by us. As of the time of the telegram, our railway front is still holding the Tuhai River. The left wing is confronting the enemy north of Gaotang, and the right wing is gathering in Shanghe and Linqu, and is fighting fiercely with the enemy. According to military observers, the enemy's intention is to use its main force to detour to our right wing and take the opportunity to cross the Yellow River, but our entire line and the riverfront fortifications are very strong, and the enemy will definitely not succeed. As for the enemy south of Dezhou, it is reported that there are about 14,000 to 15,000 men, with about 8,000 men deployed east of the railway, and it is rumored that Kayama has arrived to command the area. (Central News Agency Electric, 13th)

⊙Xinxiang: Our army recovered Dezhengji, a part of Daming County, at 2 p.m. on the 10th, capturing many enemy soldiers. According to the captured enemy soldiers, the enemy in front of them is a certain regiment of the Shibuyahara unit.

### After the Ningbo River is Blockaded, Essential Goods Are Still Being Shipped Through, Passengers Crowding Each Ship Sailing to Ningbo These Days

After our military authorities completely blockaded the Ningbo River due to the importance of coastal defense in Zhejiang Province, each ship sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo could only stop outside the port, which caused inconvenience for cargo loading and unloading. It is now learned from relevant sources that since the changes in the war situation in this city, the market's various foods are experiencing shortages and soaring prices. If fish, vegetables, and other goods from Ningbo are blocked again, it will be even more difficult for market prices to fall, and the impact on the livelihoods of citizens will be significant. Therefore, various business guilds are now making every effort to find ways to continue transporting and shipping essential goods between Shanghai and Ningbo in order to regulate the market. According to news from the Ningbo Native Place Association and the Seven Counties of Shaoxing Native Place Association in this city, after our army withdrew from Shanghai, the number of people returning to their hometowns in Ningbo and Shaoxing has been crowded on ships these days.

(Random Comments)

With respect to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the door to negotiation has been completely closed. The conference will issue a declaration condemning Japan's violation of the treaty. This is, of course, a procedural formality that is required. Now, the talk of British mediation has just been denied, and the talk of Italian mediation is again very loud. Should our country take the path of British and American mediation? Or take the path of German and Italian mediation? If we want to take the former, Japan has already expressed its refusal. This road is already impassable. If we want to take the latter, then the goodwill of the United Kingdom, the United States, and others for mediation will be completely abandoned, which is also not right. Which path should I take? I borrow the words of Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin to explain it: Any method that can equally resolve the Far East issue peacefully, our country will be happy to accept it.

### The Fall of Greater Shanghai by Zhi Zhi

Greater Shanghai! Has fallen!

This was originally in our expectation. From the perspective of the national war of resistance, after a full three months of bloody resistance, we should not be sad if we only sacrificed a small corner of Songhu. We should be excited and calm about the spirit of resistance of the national army over the past three months!

However, when we heard the last shot, and that Greater Shanghai, one of the world's six major cities, had fallen, we inevitably felt a moment of grief! How can the two or three million citizens of Shanghai bear to say goodbye to the nation!

Flames burned in our hearts! Hot blood boiled throughout our bodies!

When we had to retreat from Dacha Chang and Zhabei to the south bank of the Suzhou River, everyone shouted "Defend Greater Shanghai"—Greater Shanghai, we will never give up easily, even in the most unavoidable circumstances, we still have to defend it to the death. At that time, the plan to defend Greater Shanghai was decided: In the most unavoidable situation, when we had to retreat again from the banks of the Suzhou River in western Shanghai, we were prepared to "defend the two cities to the death" with four divisions. Later, the Jinshanwei coast was unexpectedly landed by the enemy, who drove straight to Zhanghou Songyin and other towns, so Pudong was severely threatened from the rear, and it was obviously unable to stand. At this time, the highest military authority then ordered a reduction of two divisions to defend Nanshi to the death. In fact, although Nanshi has a large area, two divisions of troops, security forces, and police brigades are enough to "defend to the death"; and it was decided that the 88th Division and the 36th Division would be stationed in Nanshi; but in the end, the policy was suddenly changed, and only the six battalions of the Zhang Bin brigade headquarters of the 55th Division stationed in Pudong were transferred to guard Nanshi, while most of the security forces had no way to come from Xinlonghua, so only the six battalions of the 55th Division, and a small number of security forces, a police brigade of about 4,000 people, and a small number of special forces, totaling only about 10,000 troops, were ordered to "hold firmly" Nanshi. At this time, giving up Nanshi was only a matter of time, and it was definitely not something that could be "defended to the death". However, we still have to make a final struggle!

Nanshi has fallen into "besieged on all sides"!

From the 9th, the isolated city of Nanshi began to attack and defend. Our army defended on the east side of the Rihui Port. The bridge signs on the Rihui Port have naturally been destroyed by our army to prevent the enemy from advancing. At that time, the enemy had just moved troops from the banks of the Suzhou River, and the positions and equipment had not yet been arranged, so the artillery fire that day was not very fierce.

On the 10th, the artillery fire continued throughout the day, but it was not very fierce, but the air raids were very fierce, and fires broke out and spread in many places. Two heavy bombers were indeed shot down by our army.

On the night of the 10th, and in the early morning of the 11th, the enemy began a general offensive. There were artillery positions in the Xujiahui Longhua and Fenglin Bridge areas, and heavy artillery was set up near the Suzhou River to bombard Nanshi across the concession. At the same time, enemy troops in the western Rihui Port also launched an offensive, and the artillery fire did not stop all night. On the morning of the 11th, the enemy's artillery fire became more intense, and our army fought back across the river, resisting calmly. In the 16th Pier area, the enemy sent two shallow-water warships and berthed near the Huangpu River blockade line, and used small motorboats to carry soldiers across the blockade line to attack our rear. At the same time, enemy troops in Pudong also fired artillery to contain our troops along the river.

We witnessed that the area from Rihui Port to the Huangpu River, and then eastward along the river to Lujiabang Road to the Manufacturing Bureau Road, was defended by the 55th Division. The area from Lujiabang Road to Chengxiang 16th Pier was the responsibility of the police brigade. Brigade Commander Zhang Bin's headquarters was located in the Huining Guild Hall, while Police Chief Cai Jinjun supervised the troops in the Penglai Road area. There were a total of seventy or eighty light and heavy machine guns, seven or eight anti-aircraft guns, and three field guns.

The enemy's artillery fire was as dense as machine guns, and five or six planes were bombing non-stop in the sky. Our important defenses along the Rihui Port were all destroyed. Then the enemy released dense smoke, which lasted for two hours. At 1:30 p.m., the enemy infantry crossed the river by building a bridge in the Pingyin Bridge area (inside Rihui Port). At this time, the sound of artillery, machine guns, and rifles was so dense that it was impossible to distinguish them. The soldiers of our army along the Rihui Port were gradually unable to resist. The telephone lines were immediately cut off, and the enemy drove straight in. At that time, Director Cai Jinjun wanted to call Brigade Commander Zhang Bin again, but he could not get through. Brigade Commander Zhang's headquarters (Huining Guild Hall) was soon occupied by the enemy.

The troops could not resist, the telephones were cut off, and the entire army lost command and fell into a state of chaos. Four enemy armored vehicles also quickly crossed the Rihui Port and rushed towards the Xieqiao area. The enemy's flames became even more rampant, so Director Cai quickly transferred a part of the police brigade along the river and rushed to the Lujiabang Road line to join the troops in the Jumen Road and Manufacturing Bureau Road areas to hold on and resist. And Zhong Yang, the captain of the fifth squadron of the police brigade, held on to the battle in the Jumen Road Huining Road area. Although the strength was very different, he still resisted bravely. At this time, Captain Zhong completed his final mission and died for his country!

At about 4 p.m., the central stronghold of Lujiabang Road had been broken through by the enemy's armored vehicles. At the same time, a corner of Lujiabang Road along the river, about 300 soldiers and police, were immediately surrounded. The enemy's small motorboats in the 16th Pier area crossed the blockade line one after another and went deep into the Huangpu River. Although our police and army used machine guns to sweep densely along the river, they killed countless enemies. However, because the enemy's artillery fire from Pudong was too dense, the enemy attempted to land under the cover of intense artillery fire, and finally succeeded. So our army's position shrank smaller and smaller. The enemy's armored vehicles on the Manufacturing Bureau Road were about to rush towards the Fangxie Road roundabout area, but were repelled by our army's concentrated fire. At that time, there were about 40,000 to 50,000 refugees in the Dajidelingyin Road and Dalin Road areas. As a result, they could not advance or retreat in the rain of bullets, and there were casualties everywhere, which was unbearable to witness! After fierce fighting until about 11 p.m., Brigade Commander Zhang and Director Cai were ordered to lead their subordinates to make an orderly retreat with pain. However, there was still a part of the team that was unwilling to retreat and vowed to perish with the position. The isolated army surrounded in a corner of Lujiabang Road along the river, because the order could not be reached, resisted to the end, unyielding! On the 12th, all day long, our loyal and heroic soldiers in the tall buildings along the river and in the urban area continued to make the final battle with the enemy.

This is the last day of the full third month since August 13th!

The spirits of our loyal, righteous, and martyred soldiers, and the hot blood of the two or three million people of Shanghai, will forever condense Greater Shanghai! (November 13)

### Enemy Warships Attempt to Disturb the Inland of Guangdong, Repeatedly Dispatch Enemy Planes to Disturb the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the West River, and Use Traitors to Sneak into the South Road to Mobilize Bandits

Guangzhou Correspondence: On the 1st and 2nd of this month, enemy planes flew several times to Zhangmutou, Tangtouxia, Shigu, Lincun, Hengli, and other stations on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, dropping bombs and bombing the tracks, and destroying dozens of civilian houses, killing and injuring dozens of farmers. On the 3rd, four enemy planes took off from the enemy aircraft carrier in Tangjiawan. When they passed through Humen at 7:40 a.m., they reconnoitered for a long time, and then flew to Tiantangwei, Shigu, Tangtouxia, and other stations on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, dropping six or seven bombs and destroying more than ten feet of roadbed. At 2:30 p.m., the enemy sent three more planes, flying between Pinghu and Datangwei, dropping eight bombs and destroying thirteen or fourteen feet of tracks. It was found that the enemy planes have been coming from the enemy aircraft carrier for several days, and the bombs they dropped are not as large as those dropped by bombers. The craters at the bombed locations are only about one foot square, which shows that the explosive power is very weak. In addition to bombing the key transportation hubs between Guangdong and Hong Kong, the enemy has recently attempted to harass the hinterland of Guangdong Province. In the West River area, the enemy sent planes to Zhaoqing in mid-October, two planes the first time and five planes the second time. They circled and reconnoitered in the sky at an altitude of more than 5,000 feet, but did not drop bombs. In southern Guangdong, because it is close to the sea, the enemy has been spying for a long time. Therefore, the enemy warships outside Humen have recently sailed to Taishan, Guanghai, Chixi, Yamen, Qiongyai, and other areas to control our South China coast. There are several enemy cruisers remaining in the waters of Guanghai and Chixi. In Tangjiawan, Zhongshan, there is an enemy aircraft carrier No. 19 fleet cruiser, and two destroyers. In Haikou, Qiongzhou, there is a Matsukaze and a destroyer No. 26, and another cruiser. In Sanliao Port, Yaxian, there are two enemy warships. Two enemy warships are berthed in Qinglan Port, Wenchang. In the waters of Qiongyai alone, the number of enemy warships has increased to seven before and after. Every night, searchlights are used to scan the shore, but the enemy sailors find it difficult to land, so they secretly send traitors to sneak into the inland of the South Road to incite bandits and ruffians and secretly form puppet troops to be the internal support for the invasion of Hainan. Recently, it has been discovered that traitors in the Gaolei area are buying bandits. Fortunately, the local defense forces discovered it and cracked down on the puppet army's special service agency. It is heard that the enemy uses Guangzhou Bay as a major base and specially sends spies to infiltrate the Southern District to organize bandits and puppet troops. The enemy provides guns, ammunition, and food. Recently, it has been rumored that dozens of bandits have been colluded with and bought, and the enemy has successively issued about 2,000 guns to enable them to form a puppet army. However, the counties in the Southern District have now vigorously trained strong men, and large bandits groups of more than 100 people have been recruited. The remaining bandits groups of one or two dozen people are not enough to cause trouble. (November 4)

### China Merchants Bureau Headquarters Relocates to Hankou to Work

### Contracts Previously Signed Continue to be Valid, Three Dock Businesses Leased to American Merchants

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the China Merchants Bureau, a state-owned enterprise, has suspended all shipping routes except for the Yangtze River route, which continues to operate as usual. These routes include the Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Guangdong route, the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Weihai-Tianjin route, the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, the Shanghai-Min route, and the Xiamen-Philippines route. Due to the current environment, the headquarters' business is being transferred to Hankou for handling effective immediately, except for personnel temporarily staying to handle the winding up of affairs. In addition, the Nan Dock (Jinliyuan, French Concession), Xin Dock (Yangjiadu, Pudong), and Hua Dock (Yangtze Wharf, Pudong) have had all their dock and pier businesses leased to the American company Willie & Han for operation. In addition to merchants being able to contact the Bureau's office to handle unfinished matters related to these docks and piers, the Bureau and Willie & Han have stipulated that all contracts previously signed with the Bureau shall remain in effect. As for the Bei Dock (Tilanqiao) and Shen Dock (Guohongqiao), they have been destroyed by bombing.

The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai reported the incident yesterday based on a letter from the Dinghai County Government and requested that the association negotiate with the wheel company. After learning the situation, the association has now forwarded a letter to the Sassoon Shipping Company, requesting that compensation be given to the deceased to comfort their families.

### The General Labor Union Comforts Wounded Soldiers and Presents Anti-Japanese Commemorative Medals

Dagong News Agency reported that the Shanghai General Labor Union believes that although the Songhu war has been temporarily abandoned due to strategic reasons, the great achievements of the heroic resistance over the past three months have not only inflicted heavy damage on the enemy but have also left a glorious historical record for the Chinese nation. At this time when all of Greater Shanghai has fallen, our respect and love for the loyal and brave soldiers wounded in the front line are even greater. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, personnel were dispatched to various wounded soldier hospitals to offer comfort and present Songhu Anti-Japanese War Commemorative Medals. The words "Chinese National Hero" are in bronze color, with a red ribbon attached. The style is beautiful and the production is very exquisite. After receiving the medals, the wounded soldiers were encouraged in spirit and were willing to fight to the death for the survival of the motherland. It is hoped that the people of Shanghai will not be discouraged or slack but will continue to be a strong backing for the loyal and brave soldiers.

In addition, Chen Chuxiang of Huacheng Tobacco Company has also donated 2,000 yuan alone.

### Strengthening Our Confidence in Victory by Liu Yucai

These past few days, the retreat of our army, on the surface, seems to be failing day by day, but little is known that such a withdrawal was already in our expectation, and at the same time, it was a step that our army's combat plan had already decided. From a military point of view, there is nothing to be alarmed about. The gains and losses of one place or one city, or even the fall of one or several provinces into the hands of the enemy, do not need to be panicked, because this is the inevitable situation at the beginning of the overall war of resistance. Not only do we not admit that we are retreating step by step, but we dare to affirm that we have already achieved full victory; may I ask, our munitions and military equipment are indeed too different from those of the enemy, and at the same time, the enemy wastefully throws bombs, and our army is still calmly fighting back. Under such a disparity in equipment, our army has always resisted in Zhabei for eighty-eight days before automatically withdrawing in an orderly manner; this automatic withdrawal cannot be confused with the annihilation of the entire army. Our army is in a situation where it can safely withdraw from its original position without suffering any damage, and will definitely not deplete its combat effectiveness. It is precisely because of strategic considerations that it is necessary to withdraw automatically. From this point, it is sufficient to prove that we have already achieved full victory; on the contrary, if our aircraft and military ships were as strong as the enemy's, then who would believe that we would not be able to drive the enemy out of the country in a month.

On the other hand, we can also criticize who belongs to the victory from the national sentiment of China and Japan. In the past three or four years, the National Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek have received a lot of criticism and complaints from the people of the whole country. Why is this? It is because the government is still unwilling to go to war with Japan? Why is Chairman Chiang unwilling, or does he not dare, to order the national army to resist Japan? Under this kind of aroused public sentiment, the government and leaders are working hard day and night to prepare, enduring hardships and bearing heavy burdens with perseverance, while the generals in the southwest and the current generals of the Eighth Route Army are also shouting loudly everywhere that it is necessary to launch the anti-Japanese army to save China from the depths of misery. Under the circumstances of the unanimous urging of the war of resistance by the military and civilians across the country, this force is very strong and great. Of course, with a shot at the Lugou Bridge, our decades of suppressed courage finally burst out violently, and our army began a desperate battle with the Japanese in North China. Although Tianjin and Beiping have now fallen, the generals in North China are still resisting the war. Although Zhabei and Nanshi have been withdrawn, Nanhui and Songjiang are still fighting the war. At this time, we do not want to attack the enemy and destroy them on their warships. At this time, we are just beginning a protracted war of attrition. This beginning will continue to the future results, and in the process, we will directly and indirectly strike fatal blows to the enemy, depleting all of their equipment and ammunition. Prolonged consumption will not only make the enemy troops lose their fighting spirit and run out of ammunition, but at the same time, the panic in the enemy's country will inevitably arise. Originally, in this Japanese

### A Refugee from Nanhui Talks About the Fall

The County Magistrate Abandoned His Post on the 5th, Leading to Chaos and Looting Throughout the County

According to the Datong News Agency, after the enemy troops landed in Pudong, residents of Nanhui County also fled to Shanghai in droves. Yesterday morning, a reporter met with

All Falling on the County Town

One fell at the intersection, and two fell inside the East Gate, destroying thirty to forty houses and killing or injuring more than twenty civilians. The county government and its affiliated agencies were all located in the North Gate and were undamaged.

Since

### Xiong Xiling and Others Initiate the Organization of Street Children's Education Association

The Municipal International Red Cross Society Appoints a Refugee Children's Education Committee

There are many street children in the city. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, they can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys, numbering in the tens of thousands. Local philanthropists Xiong Xiling, Qu Wenliu, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Heqin, the YMCA, the China Children's Education Society, and various charitable education organizations, in view of this, have initiated the organization of a Street Children's Education Association to specifically help homeless and out-of-school children who are of sufficient age, from six to fifteen years old, to provide them with appropriate education, so that they can be physically and mentally healthy, and obtain basic knowledge and skills to adapt to real life. It is said that the directors have been selected and will first use the general office of the China Children's Education Society as an office to start work.

Since the outbreak of the war in this city, there have been more than 200 refugee shelters in the concessions. There are tens of thousands of refugee children. They are idle and uneducated, which not only wastes time, but also has a great impact on the order in the shelters and in the streets and alleys. The Shanghai International Red Cross Society, in view of this, appointed Mr. Chen Heqin, Ms. Ye Lianglu, and American educator Dr. Menglu Aide as education committee members to prepare for refugee children's education methods and assist various charitable organizations to solve the educational problems of refugee children. It is said that Dr. Menglu Aide is very enthusiastic about this, and has been working tirelessly to investigate, showing a commendable sense of justice and courage.

### Embezzlement of Public Funds Deserves Death

Liu Xishan (26 years old, from Xuzhou) and Deng Nanzhang (20 years old, from Hunan) embezzled 4,000 yuan of public funds and fled to Shanghai, hiding in a certain hotel, living a carefree life. A few days ago, the two sent 3,400 yuan of this money to the Ba Xianqiao Kai Zi Er Road Post Office in the French Concession and asked them to remit it to Baoqing. The clerk Shi Jiuyuan, who was in charge of handling remittances at the post office, suspected something was wrong and detained Liu and Deng. He then reported to the French police station, and detective Chen Yishan went to take Liu and Deng back to the police station along with the public funds, and also found some of the stolen money on the two. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where Judge Liao Xun interrogated them. The Police Department's lawyer Chen Ming presented the case and requested an extension of the investigation before filing a lawsuit for trial. After reporting to the court, the judge briefly questioned the two defendants, Liu and Deng, and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation and verification.

### Japan Again Refuses to Attend the Beijing Conference

— Yi

The Japanese government has again firmly declined the second invitation to the Beijing Conference. From now on, the path of mediation in Beijing seems to have been blocked. We have long said that under today's war situation, even if mediation can succeed, it will be difficult to benefit our country. Therefore, Japan's tough attitude in diplomacy is by no means a pessimistic phenomenon in terms of the overall world situation. Moreover, Japan's attitude clearly reflects its unchanging determination to monopolize China. It can also force the United Kingdom and the United States to intensify their cooperation and give our country strong assistance.

Regarding this point, judging from the general trend, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union should have reached a considerable degree of common understanding. According to recent foreign telegrams, after consultation between the representatives of various countries, they dismissed the idea of making a final appeal to Tokyo and will take steps to deal with the stalemate under the leadership of the United States. Although we still cannot know what these steps are, we can also believe that the United Kingdom and the United States have reached the point where, even if they are only thinking of their own interests, they can no longer deal with the current problem with perfunctory means.

However, the development of the international situation is closely related to our own struggle. In the past three months, our country's spirit of resistance has indeed impressed the world. As long as we maintain this spirit to the end, we don't need to worry about other countries not coming to help. Now we have suffered some setbacks in military affairs, but this is not enough to affect the views of major friendly countries towards our country. Because they sympathize with us not because of the development of our military strength, but because of the strength of our national spirit. If we maintain an indomitable national spirit under any difficult circumstances, the bright future of our nation can be guaranteed.

### The Labor Salvation Association Issues a Letter to Workers Nationwide

Hoping to Maintain the Determination to Resist to the End and Fight to the Death to Defend Our Homeland

According to the Dagong News Agency, the China Labor Salvation Association yesterday issued a letter to workers nationwide, hoping that they would work hard and continue to resist. The original text reads: "Our heroic soldiers who have fought bloody battles in Shanghai for three months have withdrawn to the rear of the national defense line due to strategic reasons. This is indeed a painful thing. But recalling the past three months, our loyal and brave soldiers have shed blood and thrown their heads, giving the enemy a major blow and huge losses, causing them to increase reinforcements five times and launch six general offensives, a kind of embarrassing situation that was not expected by the enemy. Now, although our army has temporarily withdrawn from the vicinity of Shanghai, what the enemy has occupied is only the land of our great Shanghai, and it will never be able to conquer the spirit of the millions of citizens of our great Shanghai. Moreover, we all know that the Shanghai battle is a corner of the overall war of resistance and the beginning of a long-term war of resistance. Even if the war is slightly unfavorable, it is only a temporary setback. In the past, King Han was defeated by Xiang Yu many times, but he succeeded in one battle in the Battle of Wujiang. Moreover, today our army's temporary withdrawal has already achieved considerable success and cannot be regarded as our army's defeat, let alone the end of the war. The citizens of our great Shanghai, having learned this bloody lesson, vow to stand against the enemy and will sacrifice everything to resist to the end and fight the enemy in the final battle. On the day when the land of our great Shanghai fell, our association respectfully and sincerely addresses our workers nationwide, especially the workers of this city, hoping that they will not be discouraged in the slightest. We must work hard and strengthen our organization with a more persevering spirit to cope with the more difficult and dangerous situation in the future. We must firmly adhere to the belief indicated by our supreme leader, 'We must continue to resist until the last person,' and exert our greater strength to implement armed resistance, defend our homeland, and strive for final victory."

### Our Troops and the Enemy Engage in a Bloody Battle All Night Long at Jiashan Station

The Siege of Wangjiangjing Has Been Lifted, and Jiaxing Can Be Guaranteed to Be Safe. The Enemy's Central Route Peeps at Huangdu from Nanxiang but Does Not Dare to Advance Easily. Our Troops in Jiading Have Slightly Moved Backwards to Defend the New Position

After our army abandoned Shanghai and moved to a new position, the enemy advanced in three routes. Its main force concentrated on the left wing and attacked our Fengjing and Jiashan positions along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Our army was once forced to retreat, and the enemy advanced to Wangjiangjing. The situation in Jiaxing was extremely tense. The enemy attempted to capture Jiaxing and then peep at our Suzhou via the Sujia Road, cutting off the rear of our Kunshan and Qingpu line troops. We had already seen through their plan and gathered a large number of reinforcements to fight the enemy to the death in Wangjiangjing. We also sent a surprise force to raid the enemy's rear and recover Fengjing and Jiashan. Last night, the enemy tried its best to counterattack. After a bloody battle all night long, as of this afternoon, the two sides were fighting in the vicinity of Jiashan Station. The siege of Wangjiangjing has been lifted, and Jiaxing can be guaranteed to be safe. The enemy's plan has suffered another serious blow. The enemy's central route, on the one hand, peeped at Huangdu and Anting from Nanxiang, and at the same time advanced towards Qingpu along Qibao and Sijing. After we abandoned Sijing, the new position already had solid fortifications. There were skirmishes this morning, but the enemy did not dare to advance easily. As for Jiading, which is the enemy's right wing, the enemy has been on the defensive for half a month. There has been no fierce fighting on this line. Yesterday, our Jiading garrison had to move slightly backwards to defend the predetermined new position due to the prominent terrain. If the enemy advances, we will give them a head-on blow. This morning, a large number of enemy planes flew to Kunshan, Qingpu, Suzhou, and other places to bomb wildly. Enemy artillery also concentrated its fire on our fortifications, but the damage was minimal.

### The Enemy Invading Jiangsu and Zhejiang Suffers a Severe Blow from Our Valiant Army

Kuaixun News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: According to news from the Chinese side here, the Chinese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army that landed in Hangzhou Bay near Songjiang and Jiashan. Since landing, the Japanese army has attempted to break through the connection between the Shanghai-Hangzhou line and the Chinese army, so it has been attacking Songjiang, Fengjing, and other areas fiercely in recent days. However, the Chinese side has a strong force and solid fortifications, and the Japanese army has not succeeded so far.

### The Situation After the Fall of Qibao

Our reporter recently met with Mr. Zhang, a refugee who fled from Qibao Town. According to him, Qibao Town is densely populated and has many shops, and has always been known as a famous town in western Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the August 13th war of resistance, the town has gradually fallen into a tragic situation due to the continuous bombing by enemy planes. However, the people are attached to their homeland and reluctant to move, and few have fled. Most of the farmers, businessmen, and merchants still work day and night and strive to produce as usual. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, our army moved to a new position from the Shanghai area for strategic reasons, and Qibao Town fell successively. The tragic situation has become even worse. Mr. Zhang could not bear the harassment and planned to risk coming to Shanghai to visit relatives. He invited two companions to go with him early in the morning the other day. Unexpectedly, he was blocked halfway once. He had to travel alone lightly. Counting from the town to Xujiahui, only a dozen miles away, he was strictly inspected by the Japanese army six times. Moreover, the two companions who were blocked back the other day were young and energetic, and there was fear for their lives. As for the tens of thousands of refugees in the entire town who wanted to stay but could not, and wanted to leave but could not, they were short of food and clothing, and the situation was extremely dire.

### Refugees Describe the Tragic Situation in Sijing

According to a certain gentleman who fled from Sijing to Shanghai, the advance troops of the enemy army arrived in Sijing Town on the afternoon of the 12th, numbering about a thousand. Before that, our army made a planned retreat, and there were no fierce battles between the two sides, so the entire town was not devastated after multiple bombings. Among the enemy troops, most of them spoke Northeastern dialects. After arriving in the town, they searched for village chiefs in batches and ordered them to report on military information and local conditions. If they were slightly dissatisfied, they were immediately whipped. Those who wore uniforms and did not listen to their dispatch were executed. Those with some wealth in the countryside were also searched, so people were panic-stricken and could not live in peace. This kind of inhuman life made it impossible for people to endure, it was said.

### There Are Not Many Enemy Troops in Chuansha and Nanhui

After the fall of Pudong, traces of the enemy have been found in Chuansha and Nanhui counties along the coast, one after another in the past two days. According to locals who fled to Shanghai from there, the enemy troops entered from Fengxian and Shanghai in two routes. Because there were no soldiers left in the two counties, local order was maintained by the local militia. However, traitors were active in various villages and towns, causing the local area to fall into extreme chaos. The number of enemy troops who arrived was small, so they were rarely found in small towns in the countryside. Larger towns were all taken by the enemy. The main roads leading to Shanghai have now been blocked, making it impossible for the villagers to escape. The enemy soldiers arbitrarily broke into private houses and searched for strong men from house to house. Many of the county's agencies and buildings were also burned down. They sneaked out through small roads, and nine out of ten civilians were already in dire straits.

### Martial Law in the Concessions Will Not Be Lifted in the Short Term

Bad Elements Must Be Suppressed

According to the Dalu News, regarding the issue of martial law in the concessions, someone asked the police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession yesterday. According to the police authorities, although the Shanghai war has stopped, martial law in the Public Concession and the French Concession will continue for some time, for a week or two, it is undecided. The police department stated that the difficulties have not been lifted due to the cessation of hostilities. Many bad elements and thieves with weapons, as well as other evildoers, are currently maintaining martial law, at least to suppress these people.

According to the Times, as the situation gradually returns to normal, the British troops on the borders of the Shanghai Public Concession have been greatly reduced since yesterday. It is reported that the number of British troops along the borders of the concession has been reduced by at least half. Except for some of the most important sentry posts, the others have been abandoned and unguarded. According to sources responsible, it is said that there is currently no problem in withdrawing all British troops, but some inspection work is still needed, so it is necessary to wait for the situation to return to normal.

### Food Shortages in the Two Concessions Will Become a Serious Problem

The Municipal Council Has Negotiated with the Japanese Military Authorities to Allow Farmers to Transport Food and Vegetables

According to the Times, three months after the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the two regions of the Public Concession and the French Concession first discovered a serious problem yesterday, that is, there may be a shortage of food. Vegetables, meat, eggs, and other foods have greatly increased in price compared to Friday. Although the authorities in charge of food management in the Public Concession stated that there are still large quantities of vegetables and fresh meat, other refrigerated goods, and eggs, the general opinion is that unless the food supply route is opened within a week, food shortages are likely to become a serious problem.

The large increase in the population of the two concessions and the current large number of troops stationed in Shanghai may cause food shortages to occur sooner than expected. The reduction in food sources and the difficulty of transporting cattle, sheep, and vegetables from the western Shanghai and Pudong areas are already felt due to the Japanese army's encirclement of the two concessions. However, it is expected that the Japanese army will allow food to be transported into the concessions as before. The Japanese army has indeed allowed vendors and farmers to bring vegetables, cattle, and sheep into the concessions from Pudong and western Shanghai, but they are not allowed to return to their original places to transport more and load them into the concessions. Officials from the Shanghai Municipal Council claimed yesterday that they have negotiated with the Japanese military authorities to allow farmers to leave the two concessions to transport food and fresh vegetables. It is reported that large quantities of vegetables can be obtained from Chongming Island. Yesterday, local goods merchants and officials from the Municipal Council discussed the issue of transporting food, but Chongming Island is currently completely in the hands of the Japanese army, which may also be very difficult and requires their special permission first.

Yesterday, vegetable prices rose by 20 to 25 percent, pork was 55 to 60 cents per pound, and beef was 48 to 55 cents per pound. Although there is indeed a feeling of a shortage of fresh meat, it is reported that there are still large quantities of refrigerated meat in the concessions. There are many frozen fish, but fresh fish was almost unavailable yesterday. Chicken and duck were 50 to 55 cents per pound, and the source was said to be very small. Eggs may not be cut off, because there are many in cold storage, but fresh eggs are very few. Rice is also a problem. It is reported that the rice in the concessions is indeed enough for three months, but the rice merchants are still watching and only sell a very small amount. Yesterday, each person could only buy rice for one yuan, and only a very small number of rice shops were open. The supply of food in Nanshi is showing a shortage due to a slight obstruction in the source, so the market price is showing an upward trend day by day. The reporter went to various vegetable markets to inspect, and the above-mentioned phenomena have not been slightly alleviated. Looking at the products sold in the vegetable market, ordinary economic families have been reluctant to buy meat, so the market price has not continued to rise. However, the supply of vegetables is relatively abundant, so prices have soared, rising by more than double in recent days, and there is no sign of abating. Fish prices have also risen sharply, increasing by 40 to 50 percent. It is now known that the fresh fish industry company is making every effort to dredge the source, and the local goods industry is also trying to provide all kinds of conveniences to those who pick vegetables and bring them to the concessions. It is believed that through the efforts of the various industries, this kind of temporary situation of excitement can be resolved.
