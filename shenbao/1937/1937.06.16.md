Duke Konoe's cabinet was formed based on international and Japanese domestic justice, which harmonized the fluctuations in Japanese politics in a very short period of time, and I admire it very much. Foreign Minister Hirota is an old friend of mine, and I sincerely congratulate my old friend on his return to diplomacy. After taking office, he immediately declared that the three principles he had created in the past were no longer applicable due to the changing times, which proves his insight and keen vision, and he has a deeper understanding of the new China. Some say that Hirota's diplomacy is active, but I think that whether it is active or not, we should adhere to a single-minded approach. What is a single-minded approach? In my personal opinion, it is justice and sincerity. The so-called justice and sincerity are related, not separate. Sincerity without justice will certainly not work, and justice without sincerity will be difficult to approach. Only justice and sincerity can complement each other, and coordination and consultation with the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. If we can proceed on this basis, I believe that the future of Sino-Japanese diplomacy will be harmonious. Friendly neighboring countries will also support this statement. (Special dispatch, 16th)

### Serious Situation in Changsha Cotton Mill Labor Strike

Authorities Expel Workers from Factory; Entire Workforce Sleeps in Open Air in Front of Provincial Government; Factory Manager Fan Shudu Has Resigned; Representatives in Beijing Petition Again

[Nanjing] A labor strike has occurred at the First Cotton Mill in Hunan and has lasted for almost a month. The workers are demanding the implementation of the factory law promulgated by the Central Government to improve their treatment, but the factory has refused, resulting in a strike. The factory subsequently dismissed the workers, forcing them to leave the factory. The workers, concerned about their livelihoods, remained in the factory and sent representatives to Beijing to petition, awaiting a fair resolution. According to a report from Changsha on the 15th, the Hunan Provincial Government has now dispatched a battalion of troops to forcefully evict all 3,000 workers from the factory. The workers are now gathered in the city, lying in front of the Hunan Provincial Government to petition. Having achieved no results, they vowed not to return home, so the situation has become more serious. It is feared that any unexpected events will be difficult to handle. The workers' representatives, Chen Tianzuo, and the Hunan labor representative, Li Bingqian, went to the Central Party Headquarters again on the 15th to petition. Xu Yuanda of the Central Department of Civil Training received them and told them that the Department of Civil Training had sent a letter to the Executive Yuan, ordering the relevant departments to jointly dispatch personnel to Hunan to handle the matter with the Party Headquarters, and had also ordered the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters to consult with the Provincial Government and wait for a resolution. The workers then petitioned the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, where they were received by Tang Jianfei, Director of the Labor Department, who also said that he planned to dispatch personnel to Hunan with the Central Party Headquarters to handle the matter and had notified the Hunan Provincial Government by telegram. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)

[Changsha] The strike at the Hunan Textile Mill has been delayed and unresolved. Factory Manager Fan Xindu's request for leave has been approved, and Xiao Xiang, Section Chief of the Department of Construction of the Provincial Government, has been temporarily appointed to act as factory manager.

[Changsha] All the workers of the Hunan Cotton Mill petitioned on the 15th without result and slept in the open air in front of the Provincial Government that night. The military police dispatched teams to guard them, but the workers were very orderly. On the 16th, they continued to petition the provincial and municipal Party Headquarters. Li Yangxi, Director of the Department of Civil Training of the Provincial Party Headquarters, earnestly guided the workers, advising them to return to the factory to register in order to avoid sleeping in the open air without a home. Factory Manager Fan Xindu, due to the serious situation, requested to resign, which was approved by the provincial government. Xiao Xiang, Section Chief of the Department of Construction, was appointed to act as factory manager. The workers then appointed representatives to negotiate with the new manager, requesting two things: 1. Request temporary permission to return to the factory, guarantee the restoration of freedom, and be willing to strictly abide by order and wait for a resolution; 2. Request that the new manager adopt the workers' opinions on resumption of work and improvement of treatment. It is reported that the provincial government, in addition to ordering the new manager to formulate a plan, has also requested the Central Government to send personnel to resolve the matter together. All the workers will still sleep in the open air tonight. The municipal Party Headquarters and various trade unions sent food and supplies. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)

### What is the most effective work for national salvation during the summer vacation?

President Chiang's Talk (Continued)

Increase Knowledge, Enjoyable Spirit

Last year, the New Life Movement Promotion Association organized the University Students' Summer Rural Service Corps. The purpose was to enable current students to use their vacations to understand the countryside and experience the real situation of the current rural collapse, to encourage their spirit of serving the countryside, and to investigate bankrupt rural areas and farmers so that they could find ways to provide relief. At that time, all the students of the Central Political School participated, not counting others. In addition, 66 students from 14 other schools also participated. Although the number of participants was not large, their spirit of working hard in the hot weather had won a lot of faith from the farmers, and aroused great shame among the intellectuals who stood by. In fact, they also gained considerable experience in rural health, community surveys, and mass education. After they completed their work, they should report the details of the process to the Association. We saw all the reports and felt greatly encouraged. Many medical school students took medicine chests and propaganda to the countryside and did a lot of practical work. Many students studying economics and politics not only did service work last year but also gained a lot of knowledge that they could not get from books. In addition, students studying various subjects felt that the countryside was their best laboratory. We firmly believe that our Chinese rural areas can be rescued. Although there are many difficulties at present, we deeply feel that if everyone is willing to do their part, no matter how many difficulties there are, no matter how great the difficulties are, there will always be a day when our ambition overcomes them. The result of the rural service corps' work last summer really increased our courage and hope. Summer vacation is coming soon, and the New Life Movement Promotion Association has already been actively preparing for the second summer rural service work for college and middle school students. Based on last year's experience, this preparation will definitely be more advanced, and the plan will definitely be more comprehensive. If you feel the importance of rural service, you should immediately and without hesitation participate in this work. It will definitely not be a waste of a summer vacation of forty or fifty days of precious time. In the end, you will get great pleasure in spirit. You only need to look at the reports of last year's rural service personnel to know that what I said is absolutely true. Maybe some students have been away from the countryside for too long, or have never been to the countryside at all, and don't know what the situation in the countryside is like. They are a little afraid to participate in the service work. Our Chinese rural areas account for nine-tenths of the country, so if we want to know the real situation in China, we should take this opportunity to see what the countryside is like. Moreover, the farmers' loyalty and loveliness can easily arouse our spirit of service. The countryside may be a little dirty, but the farmers' inner purity will make us forget all the external shortcomings. Last year's rural service personnel developed a very good relationship with the farmers. When they were about to leave, everyone was reluctant to part. So you just go to the countryside. When you get there, you will feel like you have returned home. Moreover, the New Life Movement Promotion Association has already compiled a rural service method and a rural service manual. You can use these as a basis for your work. These two books not only contain many plans but also solve many difficult problems for you one by one. There is also a report on the rural service of students during the summer vacation last year, which has also been printed. You can refer to it. If there is anything you don't understand, no matter which aspect it is about, you can always write to the Nanjing New Life Movement Promotion Association for inquiries. There will naturally be a person in charge to answer you. The New Life Movement Promotion Association can also introduce you to the responsible personnel of the local government and all sectors of society. They will give you great help. Now you only need to return to your own rural hometown or go to the nearby rural areas, and only do a month or two of simple work. Are you afraid of any hardship? The summer is indeed hot and uncomfortable, and the rural environment is indeed crude and simple. Most people think that the summer vacation is the time to enjoy the cool and rest. If you ask him to serve in such a hot and uncomfortable weather, in such a crude and simple rural area, he is really unwilling. However, our Chinese rural areas have gone bankrupt to such an extent. If we don't do our best to provide relief to them in our spare time, then the imperialists will not even need to spend a bullet, and our China will perish. We must recognize that serving the rural areas is saving the country. As the saying goes, "The rise and fall of a country is the responsibility of every individual." When we are students, we are preparing. Although we are not yet able to devote all our efforts to doing things in society, we can take advantage of the summer vacation to come out and help the people and the country. Everyone must know that this work is the basic work of truly saving the country and the people, and it is the only way to save people and save ourselves.

University students should be hard-working and bear hardships

To be honest, unless a student has a special place, if he is not willing to do such important and simple rural service during the free summer vacation, then it is difficult to hope that he will contribute to the country in the future. Rural service can directly relieve the rural areas and indirectly train the body and cultivate the spirit of hard work and endurance. No matter which country, if you want to be strong, you must first have hard-working and enduring people. Many foreign college and middle school students work, give speeches, sweep streets, sell newspapers, wash clothes, and do social service work in their spare time. They all think it is a very ordinary and comfortable thing. Most of our Chinese college and middle school students live comfortably. Their clothes, food, housing, and transportation must be satisfied with their extravagant desires, and they also go to dance, gamble, and do all kinds of unreasonable and decadent things. Everyone knows the saying "graduation is unemployment". Especially university students are the intellectuals of the country and the basic people of the country. If there are so many university students in China, if they can really be hard-working and serve the society, how can they not be strong? Therefore, as long as every university student can participate in rural service and cultivate a spirit of hard work and endurance, they can take on the responsibility of saving the country from danger and restoring the nation. Therefore, many young people asked me, "What work is most beneficial to saving the country during the summer vacation?" I replied very simply, "The work of saving the country is to save the people. The work of saving the people is to go to the countryside to serve." Last year's rural service has achieved considerable results. I hope this year will have better results. In the future, I hope that all university students in the country will be mobilized to serve in the rural areas. (Central News Agency, 15th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Japan's Economic Crisis and the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Integration Plan

— Yu

In recent years, Japan has been constantly implementing a policy of external expansion. In economic terms, it has fallen into a state of ruin. This is a well-known fact. Recently, the degree of ruin has intensified, almost to the point of being irreparable. We can clearly see this from all aspects of production, trade, prices, and finance.

First, the unbalanced development of production. We certainly acknowledge that the overall index of Japanese production has increased in recent years. However, the vast majority of the increase is in military consumables, which only have a destructive effect and cannot be reproduced. As for other general industrial production (especially the daily necessities of the general public) and agricultural production, they are not only still in a state of stagnation but are also declining day by day. Therefore, in essence, the abnormal development of Japanese production is even more serious than in other countries. For the entire Japanese economy, this is clearly a bad phenomenon.

Second, the expansion of trade deficits. Japan's raw material resources are very scarce. Following the expansion of military industries, the import of raw materials will inevitably increase. Although enhanced exchange control has been implemented since January of this year to restrict the import of general goods, it has ultimately failed to suppress the huge trade deficit caused by the expansion of armaments. A large amount of gold has had to be shipped to New York, and a mandatory gold purchase law has been implemented to strengthen the concentration of gold. This situation is unsustainable in impoverished Japan.

Third, the rise in prices. Increased budgets, expanded armaments, increased trade deficits, and the decline of general commodity production and agricultural production are all mutually causal. They are making prices rise day by day. As a result of rising prices, not only can the so-called economic policy of broad national defense planned by the Japanese authorities not be carried out smoothly, but also because the burden on the general public has increased, it is easy to cause social unrest. This is the fatal wound of the Japanese economy. At the same time, it can also become a political cancer that must be resolved as soon as possible.

Fourth, the increase in financial flaws. It is impossible to reduce expenditures on budget increases and armaments expansion, and there are too many difficulties in terms of revenue. The ability to digest public bonds in the financial market has reached saturation, so it is not easy to continue issuing public bonds. At the same time, due to the poverty of the general public, there are many constraints on increasing taxes. Recently, the Japanese financial authorities have had to fall into a state of bewilderment. On the one hand, they have to comply with the military's demands, and on the other hand, they have to take into account the actual situation in the country. The difficulty of dealing with it can be known.

However, Japanese capitalism cannot sit idly by and wait for death. At present, in addition to vigorously strengthening various means of control in the country, it is also actively expanding abroad, attempting to alleviate the above-mentioned economic crisis. The main target of this external expansion is, of course, China. The "Japan-Manchukuo Economic Integration Plan" passed by the Japanese cabinet meeting on the 15th is an important item in the expansion policy. Although Japan has occupied the Northeast for more than five years, it has not been properly developed until now due to various constraints. This "Japan-Manchukuo Economic Integration Plan" is of great significance. It is said that the scope is very broad. Mining, heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and transportation facilities are all included in the "integration." That is, to develop our Northeast's resources as much as possible for Japan to use. At the same time, the Northeast will also be used as a sump for discharging Japanese manufactured goods. We have heard of the "Five-Year Industrial Plan" of the puppet Manchukuo. In fact, this is also handled by the Japanese. The funds required for this plan are estimated at 2.4 billion yen. It is stipulated that the Japanese government, the South Manchuria Railway, and Japanese private companies will bear about 1.7 billion yen. It can be seen that the plan is huge. Naturally, Japan is so poor that it cannot afford the above-mentioned 1.7 billion or 2.4 billion yen in funds. As a result, the final victims will mainly be the people of our Northeast.

In short, the Japanese economy is in a state of rupture. It is attempting to sacrifice China to mend its own rupture. The so-called "Japan-Manchukuo Economic Integration Plan" is a plan to strengthen the exploitation of Northeast resources. For the whole of China, especially North China, it goes without saying that it is extremely unfavorable. How should we pay close attention to it?

### Roosevelt talks about the New Deal without forgetting the welfare of the poor

Designing to increase national income; detailed methods jointly drafted by various departments

[Washington] President Roosevelt spoke today on the Second New Deal, saying that this large-scale social and economic plan aims to increase national wealth, so that the 30 million people who are hungry, cold, and inadequately housed can increase their income, thereby revitalizing commerce. The federal tax system does not need to be changed, and there is no intention to discriminate against the rich. The President also promised to give details in his next "fireside" broadcast speech. The details of the New Deal, increasing wages, reducing working hours, and the Social Security Act are only preliminary plans. This new plan is now being compiled by cabinet members, disaster relief personnel, and members of the National Resources Committee. It has not been stated how much the national income is expected to increase in the future. This year's total national income is estimated at 70,000,000,000 yuan, but the total amount of public debt for this fiscal year will reach 36,000,000,000 yuan. (National Telegram, 15th)

### Filipino youth unwilling to undergo military training

This year's number is 25% less

Manila - The number of Filipino youths who registered for compulsory military training this year has decreased by 25%. U.S. Military Commissioner to the Philippines, Major General MacArthur, originally intended to form a non-Filipino national defense force before the Philippines became fully independent from the United States. He is now paying close attention to this situation. When military training was first established last year, 130,000 20-year-old youths registered for enlistment. Although the registration period this year was extended from one week to one month, the training headquarters estimates that only 100,000 people have registered as of the end of last month, a decrease of 30,000 from last year. It is found that the Philippine conscription law was formulated in accordance with MacArthur's plan to train the Philippine National Defense Force. The law stipulates that 40,000 20-year-old youths must enlist for training each year. It is expected that after ten years, the number of trainees will reach 400,000. If Filipinos who reach the age of 20 have not registered for enlistment by April 1, they will be fined 40 pesos and imprisoned for one year. Government officials claim that many people have been punished, but it has now been relaxed a little. Most of the young trainees come from rural areas and usually go barefoot. Now they have to wear leather shoes and drill for several hours every day, which is very painful. Many of the youths in long-term military training are illiterate, accounting for up to 40% to 50%. Some youths need to support their families, so economic difficulties are another reason for the decrease in the number of military training registrations. (National Telegram, 16th)

### French Chamber of Deputies passes financial full-power bill

Opposition parties criticize the current government for mistakes; the Prime Minister declares to maintain the value of the franc

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies began discussing the financial full-power bill yesterday. Former Finance Minister Leno and former Prime Minister Flandin, leaders of the Central Republican Party faction of the opposition party, both delivered speeches and criticized it. Then Prime Minister Blum made a passionate reply and appealed to the communist party members to continue to support the platform of the People's Front. The House finally passed the bill with a majority of 346 votes to 247.

Flandin said, "The parties belonging to the People's Front have resolutely opposed the financial full powers requested by the three cabinets of Caillaux, Doumergue, and Poincaré in the past. When I was Prime Minister in 1935, the members of the Socialist Party also obstructed me when I requested full powers in finance. The People's Front cabinet is now going back on its word, saying that this full power is to be used to stop speculation and maintain the franc. I wonder if the government has already obtained a 10,000,000,000 franc exchange equalization fund, what else is it for? How much is left of this money and how is it used? We would like to hear the details. It is also inappropriate for the government to propose raising taxes and the price of tobacco and matches."

Leno was originally a financial expert. In his speech, he said, "The government has failed to increase the people's purchasing power. The policy of attracting funds back to the country has also failed to achieve its wishes. The government has issued more than 7,000,000,000 francs of national defense bonds, but the financial situation is still tight. The reason for this can be deeply thought about. Now there is one thing that the government must clearly explain: Is the exchange control method ready to be implemented? If it is put into practice, both the middle class and the working class will suffer from it."

Prime Minister Blum replied that the government has decided to maintain the current exchange rate of the franc and will not adopt exchange control methods, nor will it forcibly exchange public bonds. The reason why this financial full-power bill was proposed is because in the past week, speculators have used political issues as an excuse and have been actively engaging in activities on the stock exchange. "We must deal with those who manipulate finance and instigate political conspiracies." The crux of the financial difficulties is that the country's funds flowing out of the country have reached as many as 50,000,000,000 francs. The government now intends to increase certain taxes and is also considering increasing wages appropriately to offset them. This is in line with the People's Front platform. The Prime Minister finally said that the full-power bill proposed by the government is actually the government's vote of confidence, and it is hoped that the House will continue to support it. After the Prime Minister's speech, the House adjourned for a few minutes. When it reopened, the members of the Communist Party also declared that they accepted the full-power bill to show the unity of the parties of the People's Front. This bill was thus passed smoothly. (Havas Electric News on the 16th by the Central News Agency)

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies met at 9:30 p.m. today and then adjourned so that the Finance Committee could complete the review of the bill. When the Chamber of Deputies resumed its meeting at 12:15 a.m., Finance Committee reporter Schmid explained that the government had to propose the financial bill due to various accidents in order to stop speculation and manipulation, harm the interests of depositors, and prevent funds from fleeing abroad. However, the Finance Committee has now decided to limit the period of the government's exercise of full power to July 31 of this year. Members of the Communist Party, the right wing, and some members of the central faction all expressed reservations. Finance Minister Olivo then gave a speech, saying, "Since the current cabinet came to power a year ago, wholesale prices have returned to normal figures, and tax revenue from industrial and commercial profits has increased from 695,000,000 francs to 868,000,000 francs. General income tax has increased from 945,000,000 francs to 1,334,000,000 francs. The financial situation is good, as can be seen from this. However, in addition to the original budget deficit, there are also railway losses and tens of billions of francs in debt incurred by previous governments, all of which are not our fault."

### Japan's Expanded Production Plan May Be Difficult to Fulfill

Financial Resources and Manpower Are Insufficient; Planning Board Studies Specific Plans

[Tokyo] The government decided yesterday in a cabinet meeting to establish a comprehensive economic plan to communicate between Japan and "Manchukuo," based on the three principles of ⑴ balancing international payments, ⑵ adjusting the supply and demand of materials, and ⑶ expanding productivity, as the fundamental policy for expanding economic power. Therefore, the Planning Board has also decided to urgently contact relevant ministries to formulate its concrete plan. Hirota Koki, President of the Planning Board, convened a joint meeting with various ministries at the board at 1:00 PM today. Attendees included President Hirota and Deputy Director General Ino of the Planning Board, as well as investigation officials, Director-General Oya of the Tax Bureau and Director-General Kaji of the Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Director-General Kojima and To of the Industrial Affairs and Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and other relevant officials. President Hirota explained the government's policy on establishing financial and economic plans decided at yesterday's cabinet meeting and discussed the Planning Board's future liaison with various ministries to formulate a concrete plan for the issue. The Planning Board has not yet received the Ministry of Army's reference plan regarding national defense and industrial plans, so it will urge the ministry to submit it as soon as possible. At the same time, it will also require each ministry to formulate and submit a concrete plan and then use it as material to consult with relevant ministries. When it is deemed necessary, committees for various issues will be established to discuss in detail, or President Hirota will conduct political negotiations with relevant ministries to expedite the decision on the outline of the plan. Opinions were also exchanged at today's joint meeting regarding the above points. (Sixteenth, Dōmei News Agency)

[Tokyo] Yesterday's cabinet resolution to implement the three principles of integrated control of the economy of Japan and "Manchukuo" has attracted close attention from all quarters. The comprehensive five-year industrial plan drafted by the Ministry of Army, which is closely related to the six-year army replenishment plan that began this year, has been submitted to the Planning Board to draft specific procedures. This plan not only includes the five-year industrial plan for Manchuria (the realization of which requires 235 million yuan), but it will also greatly increase the production capacity of the munitions industry in Japan proper and Korea. From the perspective of national defense, the increase in production capacity is extremely necessary. This industry includes iron, steel, liquid fuel, coal, copper, soda, airplanes, automobiles, locomotives, trains, aluminum, nickel, magnesium, etc. The production capacity of all of them is planned to be increased from two or three times to six or seven times. The funds required for the implementation of the entire plan are approximately 9.3 billion yuan. If this huge amount of funds is allocated within five years, it will require approximately 1.9 billion yuan annually. However, the increase in reserves in Japan's current national wealth is only 1.5 billion yuan. Under Japan's current political and economic system, whether the government has the power to mobilize all of these annual reserves to implement its plan is a major question. Even if it is possible to use these funds, there is still a huge shortfall of 400 million yuan in the annual funds required. Therefore, whether the Ministry of Army's plan is feasible is highly doubtful. The implementation of the economy and the expansion of productivity are inevitable given Japan's current situation, but any broad and feasible procedure cannot be implemented given the economic strength, financial situation, international payments, labor, and technology. Therefore, some experts are deeply worried that many points in the plan drafted by the Ministry of Army are not suitable for the actual environment. How the Planning Board will revise the plan is a very eye-catching issue. Even in terms of labor and technology alone, the implementation of the plan has encountered serious difficulties. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry stated the other day that it is currently planning to train 500,000 skilled workers for various heavy industries, but the actual procedure this year is only able to train two or three thousand workers every two years. Japan currently feels a deep lack of skilled workers. If the above-mentioned huge plan is truly implemented, it will be necessary to train at least two or three hundred thousand workers every year. Even if there is a suitable institution for training skilled workers, the time is too long, and the implementation of this plan will further oppress the people's lives. This is another extremely serious problem. Furthermore, the absorption capacity of national public bonds has shown that it has reached a saturation point. It seems that it is impossible to rely solely on issuing public bonds to raise funds, and increasing taxes again will seriously threaten the people's lives. Whether the Japanese people will decide to endure the sacrifices of individual lives like the people of Soviet Russia and Germany and devote themselves to the expansion of national defense cannot be predicted either negatively or positively. We should pay close attention to a measure stipulated in the Ministry of Army's plan to implement a compulsory labor system in the munitions industry. In short, our attention to Japan should be on the reform of the Japanese economy, not on the changes in the political situation. The former is of greater significance than the latter, not only because political trends are mostly determined by economic changes, but also because the main task of the Konoe cabinet is to reform the structure of the Japanese economy. In short, Japan's economic entry into the German path has become an inevitable trend. (Sixteenth, Central News Agency)

[Tokyo] The general public is now speculating about the Manchurian five-year plan and the Japanese five-year industrial plan decided by the cabinet. According to Yomiuri Shimbun, the former requires 2,350,000,000 yen, and the latter will be implemented in approximately four years, costing 6,900,000,000 yen. Minister of Commerce and Industry Yoshino told a news reporter today that it is now necessary to cultivate financial resources and manpower to increase Japan's productivity. Yoshino meant that it is now necessary to implement controlled labor and prohibit workers from transferring from one factory to another, imitating what Germany or Italy has done. According to various newspapers, the government may be planning to implement compulsory labor in accordance with the compulsory military service method. (Central News Agency, Reuters, Sixteenth)

### New Trends in German Diplomacy: Foreign Minister Visits Britain, Chief of Staff Visits France

British and German Authorities Claim Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Only Seek to Remove Misunderstandings and Reach Genuine Understanding

[London] The public is paying great attention to the news that German Foreign Minister Neurath will come here on the 23rd of this month to visit the British government. It is heard that Neurath does not want to conduct any negotiations during this trip to Britain, but the public hopes that the British and German authorities will take this opportunity to exchange views on matters of common interest to the two countries, especially the Spanish question. Berlin has stated that Neurath's trip should not be seen as a departure from the policy of mutual proposals between Germany and Italy. All of the German Foreign Minister's actions are now being reported in detail to Italy, and the Italian government's views are completely in line with them. Germany hopes that this trip will make the European political situation more moderate. It is heard that the West European Pact is also among the matters that British Foreign Secretary Eden will discuss with Neurath after he arrives here. However, apart from clarifying the opinions of both Britain and Germany, there will be no major developments. It is now believed that the British government's attitude has not changed and still regards the conclusion of the West European Pact as the first step towards a general resolution. The Spanish question will be one of the main issues discussed by both sides. It is now hoped that after the meeting with Neurath, Germany's views on the possibility of strengthening the monitoring plan and withdrawing foreign volunteers from Spain will be understood. (Central News Agency, Reuters, Sixteenth)

[London] German Foreign Minister Neurath, at the invitation of the British government, is now scheduled to come here on June 23 for a formal visit. According to the communiqué, the British and German diplomatic authorities are not planning to hold negotiations at that time, but it is generally hoped that Neurath's visit here can be used to exchange views with the British authorities on issues related to Britain and Germany, especially the Spanish question. In addition, after German warships shelled the Spanish port of Almeria earlier this month, the British government originally planned to invite Neurath to come to Britain immediately to seek a solution to the issue of the safety of Spanish maritime monitoring ships. At that time, after the British and French governments reached complete agreement, they issued an invitation to Neurath. Neurath replied that he was very willing to visit Britain, but he already had an appointment to visit the Balkan Peninsula countries first, so he could not spare the time for the time being. Therefore, it was postponed until the 23rd of this month before he could come to Britain. According to responsible sources, the French government has been informed of the British government's invitation to Neurath to come to Britain, so it cannot be considered that British policy has changed as a result. It is heard that after Neurath comes to Britain, the talks between the two sides will focus on the withdrawal of all foreign volunteers from Spain, as Britain believes that this is one of the most important issues in Europe at present. In addition, the British cabinet ministers will also present Britain's position on various European issues to Neurath, among which the issue of the new Locarno Pact and the solution to general Western European issues are particularly important. Political figures believe that it is worth noting that before the closing of the British Imperial Conference today, the report on foreign policy was passed, which recognizes that the principles of various regional agreements should not contradict the principles of the League of Nations Covenant. (Central News Agency, Havas, Fifteenth)

[Berlin] According to an official announcement here, German Foreign Minister Neurath is scheduled to visit London this month. It is learned that the purpose of this trip is not to conduct negotiations on a specific issue, but to exchange views on issues related to both countries, including the Spanish question. Official sources said that Neurath's trip is in accordance with Germany's consistent policy of directly meeting with politicians from various countries to promote European peace. Therefore, the German Foreign Minister's visit to Britain this time is of the same nature as his visits to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Hungary. (Fifteenth, Nationalist Maritime Telegraph)

### Basque Army Defends Bilbao to the Death

Two Armies Compete for Southwest Mountains; British Ships Protect Evacuation of Refugees

Andorra Although there are widespread rumors that Bilbao has fallen, the Basque army is indeed still defending the city and fighting to the death. This statement has been confirmed by a communiqué issued by the Salamanca Nationalist Army. The communiqué admits that the Nationalist Army has not yet been able to directly attack Bilbao and that the Basque army still occupies the highlands southwest of the city. Nationalist Army aircraft are heavily bombing the area. According to news from Vitoria, the Nationalist Army has captured 5,000 enemy soldiers since breaking through the "Iron Ring Defense" of Bilbao on Sunday. At the same time, the people of Bilbao are still leaving in succession, and British warships are protecting them. If the Basque government abides by the promise to limit the evacuees to women, children, and the elderly as hostages, then the British warships will continue to provide protection.

Vitoria The last line of defense of the Bilbao government army is most heavily fortified in the Garda Kano area. The area is located in the middle of towering mountains, and the terrain is extremely dangerous. The Nationalist Army has recently begun to attack the area and is constantly sending aircraft to bomb the enemy's positions, but it seems that reinforcements have arrived for the government army, and they are now stubbornly resisting. The Nationalist Army has recently stored a large amount of food near the port of Bilbao. As soon as it enters the port, it will be distributed to the residents. In recent days, the Nationalist Army has captured more than 10,000 prisoners in total. Hundreds of government army soldiers are abandoning their weapons and surrendering every day.

[London] An Argentine observer on the Basque front line wired today from Saint-Jean-de-Luz, saying, "I observed the front line and saw a large rebel force ready. As soon as the order to enter the city is given, they can enter Bilbao at any time. About 8,000 or more Basques along the coast have surrendered to the rebels," and believe that the rebels may enter the city on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning.

### US Steel Industry Strike Deadlocked

Governor's Mediation Unsuccessful

[Washington] A reporter asked President Roosevelt today whether the major steel companies' failure to sign a contract with the Committee for Industrial Organization would violate the Wagner Labor Act. The President replied, "Since the steel companies are willing to conduct collective bargaining with the CIO verbally, why are they unwilling to sign a contract?" However, the President did not name any steel companies. (Fifteenth, Nationalist Telegraph)

Columbus Ohio Governor Davey convened a meeting of mine representatives today, which lasted for four hours. After the meeting, representatives of the Republic Iron & Steel Company and the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company said that their attitudes had not changed. Representatives of Inland Steel Company and Bethlehem Steel Company did not attend. Although today's meeting made no progress, the Governor announced that he still intends to convene a third meeting this week. (Fifteenth, Nationalist Telegraph)

Warren The strike at the Republic Steel Corporation plant in this city is becoming increasingly tense. Two factions have emerged among the workers, those who support the strike and those who oppose it, and they are fighting each other. Today, a section of the railroad track from Pennsylvania to one of the Republic Steel Corporation's plants was destroyed by striking workers with explosives. Prior to this, 35 freight cars from the company had just passed through the railroad track and entered the plant to resume work. After the destruction, the track was immediately repaired and the power was turned on as usual. Although there were hundreds of striking pickets glaring nearby, they could do nothing because of the strict protection of the military and police. In addition, a large number of miners who do not belong to the Committee for Industrial Progress have come to Warren and Youngstown from various places. Because the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company has announced that its plants will resume work on the 16th and will be protected by a large number of military and police, these miners have been recruited to replace the striking workers to do the work.

### Famous Opium King Ye Qinghe Arrested in Fujian

Evidence of Ye's Treasonous Acts Obtained; Also Trafficking Drugs and Selling Goods from a Certain Country

Xiamen Correspondence Recently, a certain number of foreign nationals have been going deep into the interior of southern Fujian, plotting wrongdoing or having ulterior motives. There must also be traitors in various places colluding with them. The crisis is latent and deeply concerning. The jurisdiction of the Heshan Special Zone is the entire Xiamen Island outside the Xiamen urban area. It was originally the interior, and foreigners or foreign nationals have no right to reside there. However, in fact, there are still thousands of foreign nationals living in Heshan, and those with clear nationalities are still easy to defend against. Those who are seemingly right but not, or seemingly not but actually are, such as bat factions or individuals with unclear nationalities, are countless and hard to guard against. Recently, such as the famous opium king Ye Qinghe, presented a petition to the Heshan Special Zone Office, requesting that the coastal area from Zhongzhai to Gangshuitou be opened as a fishing ground, and also submitted it to the provincial government for filing. This section of the coast, from Zhongzhai through Tiantou, Gaoban, Banzhi, to Hongshuitou, is more than four miles long and about one mile wide. The Special Zone Office is sending personnel to investigate. Ye was originally from Xiamen, and only last autumn did he seek to obtain Japanese citizenship in Taiwan. However, Ye's Chinese citizenship was not canceled, and he is truly a dual-national individual. He is currently serving as the general manager of the Yumin Company, which is responsible for selling opium throughout Fujian Province. The people of Heshan have questioned Ye's nationality, and the matter concerns national territory, and have jointly opposed its realization.

In the midst of this plot, Ye Qinghe was suddenly arrested in Fuzhou by the provincial government on the 12th. At the same time, Cheng Yunshan, Director of the Fujian Opium Suppression Inspectorate, was also detained. Ye's confidant, Yumin Company Secretary Lu, was arrested in Xiamen on the same day and sent to the province on the 13th. It is rumored that Ye and Lu were detained for smuggling and bribery. In addition, there are also acts of treason and espionage and conspiracy and reactionary relationships on the international stage. Earlier, a Taiwanese man was captured in Quanzhou ten days ago. This man served as the principal of a certain middle school in Xiamen around 1924 or 1925. Spy documents were seized, including survey forms on the donations, taxes, military affairs, and politics of southern Fujian. As a result of strict investigation, Ye was indeed involved. Furthermore, there is evidence that Ye and Lu's arrest was mainly due to this. Cheng's detention was because Lu had a close relationship with Ye Bai. The provincial government is handling this case very secretly. When the Taiwanese man was arrested, the Japanese consul in Xiamen immediately requested extradition. The Jinjiang County Government denied it. The Japanese consul then negotiated with the provincial government, which also denied arresting this person. According to custom, foreigners must obtain a travel passport from the provincial government before entering the interior, so that the government can assume the responsibility of protection. Otherwise, there is no proof and no way to negotiate. The provincial government's arrest of Ye was also very secret, wanting no one to know. However, Ye's Chinese citizenship has not been canceled, so he cannot immediately escape the sanctions of our country's laws. It is heard that this case may be sent to the capital if necessary. Ye is an internationally renowned opium king. Years ago, he escaped back to Shanghai after committing a drug case there. To this day, the Shanghai court has an arrest warrant for him. He has a great influence in Xiamen and Fuzhou and has been in charge of special goods throughout the province for many years. In society, he uses the name Ye Qinghe without hesitation, but on the documents of the Yumin Company and when obtaining Japanese citizenship, he changes his name to Ye Zhensheng to avoid the Shanghai court's arrest warrant. This person intends to do evil and is openly unashamed. Last year, he spent tens of thousands of yuan to obtain Japanese citizenship, and the Japanese side immediately used him to preside over a certain movement in southern Fujian. This spring, Ye personally went to Dalian and Tianjin to contact certain military authorities. After returning, Tianjin drugs and Rehe opium were successively transported to Xiamen. Northeast agricultural products and certain foreign goods were also dumped in southern China under Ye's direction. If something happens in Fujian one day, Ye will be the second Yin Rugeng, but his crimes are far more than that. During his tenure as the seller of special goods, he also transported a large amount of drugs. A month ago, Ye sued two Japanese people in Taiwan, accusing the two Japanese people of selling him fake morphine two years ago, delivering the goods in Xiamen, and defrauding him of 43,000 yuan. This is only exposing a part of it. This arrest is probably because he used his position to transport a large number of drugs, which is also one of them. (Fifteenth)

### A Certain Party Induces and Recruits Laborers, Already Transporting 240,000 People

Assigned to Develop the Puppet Manchukuo and Build Roads, Over Sixty Traitorous Labor Recruiters Apprehended in Tianjin, Hebei Provincial Government Formulates Measures to Suppress Labor Recruitment

Tianjin Correspondence: A certain party employs traitors to induce and recruit laborers in the inland areas of Hebei Province and the border regions of Shandong and Henan Provinces for work outside the customs. Tianjin serves as the central hub, with the so-called "entry procedures" handled by the Daito and Sanko companies in the Japanese concession of Tianjin. According to investigations, since the beginning of spring, approximately 40% of the exported workers have been transported out of the customs via the Beining Railway, and about 60% have been transshipped to Dalian by sea. Japanese ships, such as the Tsuko Maru and the Nissho Maru, have been specializing in transporting laborers in recent months. As of now, a total of 240,000 people have been transported out, still 160,000 people short of the number required by a certain party. However, recently our side has been strictly cracking down on laborers leaving the customs, and the laborers have also heard that their lives and safety are not guaranteed after leaving the customs, and many have suddenly woken up and no longer fall for the traps. Therefore, in recent days, the number of laborers leaving the customs has decreased significantly. Some traitors who recruit laborers for a certain party have gone deep into the inland areas to intensify their efforts to win over and persuade people. However, due to the accounts of hardship from laborers who escaped back from outside the customs, the news spread far and wide, and the inland workers have all come to view leaving the customs as a dangerous path. Although the traitors have exhausted their sweet words and promises of benefits, it is still difficult to achieve results. A certain party is extremely anxious about this and has now increased the recruitment reward from six yuan to eight yuan per person in order to attract more people. Furthermore, the purpose of recruiting laborers is nothing more than two points. First, to implement the "Five-Year Plan for the Development of Puppet Manchukuo Industries." This year is the first year, and there is a great need for workers in mining, gold mining, road construction, river dredging, and other projects. At least 380,000 people are required to meet the allocation needs. Therefore, in addition to employing traitors to persuade people everywhere, a certain party has also ordered Yin Ni in the counties of "Eastern Hebei" to forcibly conscript 100,000 able-bodied men for transportation to "Manchukuo" for use. Second, to build roads in the border areas of Inner Mongolia and Chahar. The plans include more than ten lines, such as the Zhanzhang (Zhanyuan to Zhangbei) and the Chao Cheng (Chaoyang to Chengde), to facilitate the transportation of troops, military supplies, and private goods. This matter also requires 120,000 people. Therefore, the total demand for laborers this year is 400,000 people. In recent months, more than sixty traitors who recruited laborers for a certain party have been arrested here and transferred to the local court by the Tianjin Municipal Police Department for investigation and prosecution according to law. The most prominent case is the Zhang Zijie case. The criminal Zhang recruited laborers for a certain country's military police to transport to Mongolia for road construction. The enticed hard laborers, such as Li Baoqing, were forced to work under the supervision of a certain country's people during the day, and at night, a certain country's people surrounded the residences with electric fences to prevent their escape. The criminal Zhang also extorted money and goods from Li Shiqing and others. One of the hard laborers, named Li Changbao, was beaten to death by a certain country's people. Li Baoqing took the opportunity to escape back to Tianjin. On April 12 of this year, Li Baoqing and the criminal Zhang coincidentally met at the Tongxing Store in Hedong, which led to the cracking of the case. The Tianjin Local Court recently sentenced the criminal Zhang to thirteen years of imprisonment for the crime of continuously and illegally depriving people of their freedom, and he has already been sent to prison for execution. Other labor recruitment traitors, such as Yang Zhongsheng, Miao Chungui, Wang Yonghe, Hu Shaotang, Shao Huating, Gao Zhenfan, Wang Dongjiang, Li Liandi, etc., have been sentenced to two or three years or three or five years of imprisonment.

The Hebei Provincial Government has recently formulated the Hebei Province Labor Recruitment Management Regulations to crack down on illegal labor recruitment. The full text consists of five articles and has been submitted to the Jicha Political Committee for approval, ordering all subordinate counties to comply with it and notifying the Tianjin Municipal Government for information. The original text is as follows: Article 1: Any labor recruitment offices established in the counties of this province shall submit a register containing the organization's name, location, business scope, and the name, age, and origin of the manager, obtain a reliable commercial guarantee, and obtain two telegram certifications from the responsible authorities in the work location. Only after approval by the provincial government can recruitment be conducted. Article 2: Each time the labor recruitment office recruits workers, it shall submit a draft of the recruitment area, the number of workers, the destination, the type and duration of work, and the worker's treatment (such as working hours, wages, payment procedures, round-trip travel expenses, medical subsidies for injuries and illnesses, and death benefits) to the provincial government for approval. After approval, the county governments in the recruitment area will be notified to allow them to recruit workers in accordance with the regulations. Article 3: After the labor recruitment office has recruited all the workers, it shall immediately submit a register of the workers' names, ages, and origins to the county governments in the recruitment area for record. Article 4: When the labor recruitment office violates the provisions of these regulations, the county governments in charge or in the recruitment area shall investigate and crack down on the violations separately. Article 5: If there are any matters not covered by these regulations, the provincial government may amend them at any time and implement them after they are decided by the provincial government's committee meeting.

### Song Zheyuan's Reasons for Staying in His Hometown

Rumors About Personnel Changes Are Untrue

Tianjin Correspondence: Since Song Zheyuan returned to his hometown of Leling, he has stayed away for a long time, causing rumors about diplomatic issues and personnel changes here to resurface. How Pingjin feels about Song personally is little noticed. However, the rumors that Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong has expressed his passivity and will be replaced by Liu Ruming and Zhao Dengyu are more prevalent. Whether Zhang has indeed resigned has not yet been proven by facts, but Zhang's Secretary-General Ma Yanzhang has indeed resigned. When Ma Yan met with reporters last Friday, he personally revealed the news. Who will be his successor? It mostly concerns the issue of Mayor Zhang Zizhong. Song's residence in his hometown is secluded and simple, not asking about right and wrong. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, it was rumored that he would return to Ping to handle government affairs in two or three days after the festival. Judging from the current situation, the date of his return to Ping may still be pending. Since Ikeda, a staff officer of the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin, visited Song in Leling last week for talks, Song has made clear his intentions. The central and local policies on the economic development of North China are completely consistent. With political issues unresolved, discussions on the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway, the Tanggu Port Construction, and the Luyan Salt Improvement will be postponed. If the Japanese side shows genuine sincerity in cooperation, they can first handle the Longyan Railway. However, this matter is subject to an absolute condition: China is willing to provide the interest and manage it independently, and is unwilling for the Japanese side to join the capital and create a Sino-Japanese joint venture system. Second to this matter, cotton improvement and production, and wool improvement and breeding can be handled. If the Japanese side agrees, they can be contacted at any time, regardless of whether he returns to Ping or not, because there is a dedicated person responsible for the talks. Between the central government and Jicha, apart from those that cannot be held due to the special environment, the local authorities have recently respected the authority of the central government and have done their best to implement the laws and regulations promulgated by the government. For example, for the military training during the summer vacation, Li Wentian, the commander of the 37th Division of the 29th Army and the deputy commander of the 38th Division of the Security Army (and the Director of the Tianjin Police Bureau), was appointed as the training team leader, responsible for the centralized training of Hebei Province and Tianjin City. For example, for the election of National Assembly representatives, Hebei Province has already divided districts and is preparing, and the cities of Pingjin are also starting to work on it. In addition, all matters within the scope of the responsibilities and powers of the local authorities and without external interference are followed without violation. Therefore, considering the situation and logic, the previous two rumors about Song's delayed return to office are not entirely true. (13th)

### The Yarn Market Turmoil Can Be Said to Be Over, New Trading Resumes Today

Both Near and Distant Futures Yarn Prices Fall Back After Yesterday's Resumption of Auction, Competent Authorities Continue to Thoroughly Investigate Accounts

The yarn market resumed auction yesterday morning, with both near and distant futures market prices falling back. The market situation has stabilized. The exchange will resume new trading starting today. The competent authorities are still closely investigating the accounts of brokers. Once the investigation is completed, it will be submitted to the central authorities for review. Details are as follows:

Resumption of Auction Situation

At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the Brokers Association held a temporary meeting of its members to report the exchange's decision that if either the buyer or seller deliberately disrupts the market, their qualifications will be revoked and their business will be suspended. After the mediation of the association's directors, the exchange rang the bell and opened the auction at 10:30 AM after the meeting adjourned at 10:20 AM. When the first lot of June futures yarn was auctioned, the long side lowered the market price, and the short side did not reach out to respond. The market atmosphere went from tense to silent, lasting for ten minutes. The long side lowered the market price again to sell, so the result was that the June futures market price was auctioned at 284.10 yuan (compared to the red card market price of 287 yuan before the 15th, a drop of 6.90 yuan), the July futures were at 277.50 yuan (red card 279.50 yuan), a drop of 2.50 yuan, the August futures were at 274.50 yuan (red card 277.10 yuan), a drop of 1.60 yuan, and the September futures were at 274.20 yuan (red card 277 yuan), a drop of 2.80 yuan. The closing result was that the afternoon market opened at 1:00 PM, with the first lot (June futures) at 278 yuan, (July futures) at 275.10 yuan, (August futures) at 274 yuan, and (September futures) at 272.50 yuan. The second lot (June futures) was at 278.30 yuan, (July futures) at 275.80 yuan, (August futures) at 276.50 yuan, and (September futures) at 274 yuan. The third lot (June futures) was at 378 yuan, (July futures) at 278.40 yuan, (August futures) at 276.90 yuan, and (September futures) at 277 yuan. The fourth lot (the closing) when auctioning the June futures, the market price fell to more than 8 yuan, although the long side sold, the short side refused to cover, so it could not be auctioned and remained on the blackboard, (July futures) at 276 yuan, (August futures) at 275 yuan, and (September futures) at 275.50 yuan. In total, the total volume of yarn auctioned in the morning and afternoon yesterday reached more than 100,000 bales, of which about 30,000 bales were sold by small, scattered long side, but the number of large long side was limited.

Main Reasons for the Fall in Auction Prices

According to Mr. Du Yuesheng's advice to buyers and sellers, when trading at the opening yesterday morning, the market price should still maintain the red card price of the 15th as the standard and should not rise or fall again. However, the market price of yarn futures for each month suddenly fell back after the opening. According to the Great Public News reporter's detailed inquiries from all parties, the reasons for the fall are that (1) the market price of foreign cotton fell slightly, (2) the short side was unwilling to cover, and the long side sold in large quantities, (3) the summer is here, the weather is hot, and cotton yarn sales are weak. This fall is based on the general actual situation of domestic and foreign business conditions, and it is not the market suppressing the market price.

New Trading Resumes Today

The market is scheduled to resume new trading starting today. The announcements are recorded as follows: (Announcement No. 2019) New trading of cotton and cotton yarn will resume from the 17th. In addition to filing with the ministry for record and notifying the Brokers Association, this is hereby announced. (Announcement No. 2020) Starting from June 17, the special margin for new trading of cotton futures for each month made by various brokers will be re-stipulated as follows: June futures will be charged 9 yuan in cash per dan, July futures 6 yuan, August and September futures 6 yuan. New two-deposit accounts will be charged to both parties. In addition to notifying the Brokers Association, this is hereby announced. (Announcement No. 2021) Starting from June 17, in addition to the basic margin and special margin for new trading of cotton yarn futures made by each broker, a pre-paid margin of 50 yuan in cash per bale will be charged. New two-deposit accounts will be charged to both parties. In addition to notifying the Brokers Association, this is hereby announced. (Announcement No. 2022) Starting from the 17th, the special margin for large-scale trading of cotton and yarn made by brokers will be charged to one party according to the fixed rate of Announcement No. 1971. In addition to notifying the Brokers Association, this is hereby announced.

Authorities Continue to Investigate Accounts

The speculative manipulation of market prices and the surge in prices in the yarn market has been thoroughly investigated by the Supervisory Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, which sent special officials to Shanghai. Since the day before yesterday, they have been working with the exchange supervisors to go to the market to review the monthly accounts of brokers. Because the procedures are very complicated, only six long brokers have been investigated from morning to night. Therefore, the investigation continued yesterday morning, and they rested in the afternoon. After the accounts of the long brokers have been investigated, the accounts of the short brokers will be investigated. In the future, after all the accounts have been investigated, they will be submitted to the central competent authorities for review. If any manipulation or disruption of the market is found, it will be severely investigated and dealt with.

The Brokerage Association's Statement

The Brokerage Association sent a letter to the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, saying, "To Whom It May Concern: Herewith is a letter from our members Yuda et al., stating that the recent turmoil in the exchange was caused by the sellers selling in large quantities, which could not be maintained. At first, they refused to allow the auction, and then they asked Chairman Du of the Local Forces Association to mediate. When the auction was resumed, the buyers saw that our buying brokers accepted the mediation, and they encouraged the principals to continue selling, so they wantonly lowered the price and took advantage of the situation. As of today, the price of cotton yarn for this month has fallen to 280.10 yuan, a huge drop of 14.90 yuan compared to the market price on the 8th. Considering that the spot price of 20-count Golden Rooster is 300 yuan, after deducting the unified tax and exchange market price, it should be 289 yuan. Even if the prices of other brands of cotton yarn are lower, they are all above the exchange market price. On the 13th, the council of the exchange stopped new trading of cotton yarn and cotton to cope with the tense situation. Now that the tense situation has passed, if the new trading is still stopped, the sellers can use their united strength to hold down and suppress the price at all costs. The buyers have no activity and can only be slaughtered. How can this be said to be fair? And the purpose of the exchange to stabilize the market price and regulate finance will lose its effect. We urge you to forward this letter to the council of the exchange immediately to cancel the announcement to stop new trading of yarn and cotton. We would be deeply grateful."

The Ministry of Industry Discusses Prevention Methods

Nanjing News: The Ministry of Industry believes that the exchange turmoil has a great impact on the market. On the 16th, Minister Wu Dingchang invited counselors Chen Feishi and Director Zhang Yizhou to discuss prevention methods. It is heard that it has been decided to formulate and implement prevention methods, which will be drafted immediately. After the draft is completed, it will be sent to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.

### Merchant Steam Navigation Bureau Marine Engineers Request Improved Treatment

Five Demands Submitted; Request the Marine Engineers Association to Negotiate

Since Cai Zhenshen took office as General Manager and Shen Zhongyi as Deputy General Manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, they have reorganized various aspects such as business and pier management, with considerable success. However, there has been no practical improvement in the treatment of crew members. For example, the treatment of marine engineers has not been improved, and recently only the salaries of captains have been increased, while the salaries of other crew members have not been increased, which is unfair. All the marine engineers of the bureau have repeatedly appealed for improvement. Recently, they also requested the China Marine Engineers Association to forward a letter to the bureau to negotiate the five demands they put forward, which are extracted as follows: ① Increase treatment: (A) Chief Engineer: starting salary of 250 yuan, with an increase of 20 yuan after one year of service, 40 yuan after two years, and then a yearly increase, not exceeding the captain's salary; (B) First Assistant Engineer: starting salary of 170 yuan, with an increase of 15 yuan after one year of service, 30 yuan after two years, and then a yearly increase, not exceeding the chief engineer's starting salary; (C) Second Assistant Engineer: starting salary of 120 yuan, with an increase of 10 yuan after one year of service, 20 yuan after two years, and then a yearly increase, not exceeding the first assistant engineer's starting salary; (D) Third Assistant Engineer: starting salary of 90 yuan, with an increase of 5 yuan after one year of service, 10 yuan after two years, and then a yearly increase, not exceeding the second assistant engineer's starting salary; ② Please add salary for Sundays and public holidays; ③ There must be one month of rest every year, and salary should be paid during the rest period.

### Traffic, Jiangsu, and Agricultural Banks Jointly Form a Native Cloth Loan Syndicate

The Exact Amount of Investment Has Not Yet Been Decided; Commissioner Ge from Nantong Will Come to Shanghai

In Nantong counties of Jiangsu Province, farmers rely solely on native cloth as a sideline occupation. Now, for the sake of development, leaders of the official and business sectors of the county, in addition to jointly uniting with industrial and financial circles to organize the Nantong Native Cloth Improvement Association and formulating a three-year improvement plan, Commissioner Ge from the administrative supervision office of the district will come to Shanghai to contact the Shanghai banking community to organize a "Native Cloth Syndicate" to invest in the sideline occupation of Nantong farmers. According to the reporter of the Shenzhou News Agency, who inquired about the matter from the financial community of this city yesterday, the syndicate will be jointly formed by the Traffic Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and will be led by the Traffic Bank. Because the above three banks have been most active in promoting rural sideline occupations in Jiangsu Province, the initial loan method has been approved by the board of directors of the Traffic Bank and a decision to proceed has been made. What is now awaiting negotiation is the entire method and the detailed rules for extending loans, so Commissioner Ge will come to Shanghai again in the next few days to discuss the matter. It is said that the exact amount of investment has not yet been decided when it starts, but the banks are very enthusiastic about promoting native cloth, and it is possible to expand to one million or more. According to relevant parties, promoting native cloth means developing household industries and rural sideline occupations, and the mission is extremely important. However, these sideline occupations are all legacies of patriarchal society, and it is more difficult to implement reforms. For example, it is not easy to make old-fashioned things conform to the new style in an instant. Therefore, for the sake of developing the countryside, the banking community has decided to proceed with the native cloth syndicate, and will conduct thorough research and implementation of all methods to seek development and improvement.

### Representatives from All Walks of Life Held a Memorial Ceremony for the Premier's Ordeal in Guangzhou Yesterday Morning

The Entire City Flew Flags in Commemoration

Yesterday (the 16th) was the 15th anniversary of the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou. The city party headquarters specially convened representatives from all walks of life at 10:00 AM yesterday morning in the auditorium of the headquarters to hold a memorial meeting, with Pan Gongzhan as the chairman, Du Mengsen as the recorder, and Zhang Hanyun as the master of ceremonies. All agencies, organizations, schools, party headquarters at all levels, and households in the city flew flags in commemoration. The details are recorded as follows:

Representatives Attending the Meeting

Pan Gongzhan from the city party headquarters, Lou Zhaoding from the Bureau of Navigation Affairs, Huang Zaoxiong from the Education Association, Lin Kecong from the Women's Association, Huang Xianggu from the French Concession Taxpayers Association, Hu Tianzeng from the New Life Movement Association, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Undertakings Promotion Association, Zhang Yichen from the First Special District Citizens' Association, Gong Jingyan from the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Hu Shouqi from the South District Citizens' Association, Zhu Shide from the National Products Sustaining Association, Zhang Sheng from the Agricultural and Industrial Life Improvement Society, Ma Hanfeng from the Labor Education Association, Zhao Zhenhui from the Pharmaceutical Workers Union, Yu Yaoqiu from the Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association, and more than 200 representatives from the local court, Wuben Girls' High School, Minli Girls' High School, New Asia High School, and various agencies, organizations, schools, and party headquarters at all levels.

Meeting Order

① All stand at attention; ② Sing the party song; ③ Pay the highest respect to the party and national flag and the Premier's portrait; ④ Read the Premier's will; ⑤ Silent tribute; ⑥ Report; ⑦ Speech; ⑧ Slogans; ⑨ Adjournment;

Chairman's Report

After the ceremonial procedures, Chairman Pan Gongzhan gave a report, stating that the Premier's life experience, the blows he suffered to the revolution, were no less than ten times. After the Xinhai Revolution, he thought that the Republic of China had been established, but who knew that Yuan Shikai would restore the imperial system, Zhang Xun would attempt restoration, warlords would divide the country, and internal unrest would not subside, leaving only the name of the Republic of China. Therefore, the Premier advocated the establishment of a truly Three People's Principles republic, which must defeat the warlords and imperialism, otherwise the revolution would not succeed. Therefore, the Premier established a revolutionary government in Guangzhou, but unexpectedly, just as he was deploying the Northern Expedition, the troops all departed for the Guangxi-Hunan front, entrusting the important task of the rear to Chen Jiongming. At this time, Chen colluded with Wu Peifu and brewed a rebellion. The Premier received the news, returned to Guangdong to take charge, and changed course to the Northern Expedition. Chen fled to Huizhou, expressing opposition. The Premier then removed him from the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hoping for his repentance. At that time, there were not many troops stationed in the suburbs of Guangzhou. Chen took the opportunity to incite rebellion. The Premier initially did not believe it, and when it was confirmed, he was still unwilling to leave the Presidential Palace. Later, at the request of his comrades, he boarded the Yongfeng warship in Baietan to mobilize troops to suppress the rebellion, waiting for two months, firmly maintaining discipline, regulations and prestige. We have recently read Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Half-Month Record of the Xi'an Incident. Last year's Xi'an Incident was completely similar to the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou. Being able to face great difficulties and not be coerced into submission requires cultivation in ordinary times, which is easy to achieve. When the Premier suffered in Guangzhou, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also personally followed and was inspired by the Premier's great spirit to maintain discipline and justice in the face of this great difficulty. This kind of fearless spirit is truly a model for revolutionary comrades. Therefore, we feel the necessity of cultivation in ordinary times, and hope that our party comrades will work together to complete the revolution, etc. Then he shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.

Meeting Slogans

① Emulate the Premier's revolutionary spirit; ② Rectify party discipline and strengthen the organization; ③ Unite sincerely and jointly meet the national crisis; ④ Support the leader and consolidate the central government; ⑤ Promote production and construction; ⑥ Long live the Three People's Principles; ⑦ Long live the Kuomintang; ⑧ Long live the Republic of China;

Other Organizations

The Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway convened more than 100 party members from the Railway Bureau, various workers' organizations, workers' schools, Rotary elementary schools, and the party headquarters of the first district under its jurisdiction yesterday to hold a memorial meeting for the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou. Chen Chengshi presided over the meeting and reported on the historical summary of the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou and commemorative thoughts, followed by a speech by Ying Shouzhi, and then shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting. Also, the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen of the Kuomintang held a memorial meeting for the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou at 10:00 AM yesterday morning in the auditorium of the headquarters on Zhonghua Road, Dahanmen, with more than 200 people attending. The special commissioner Yang Xiaotian presided over the meeting, and Secretary Li Suixian reported on the details of the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou. The propaganda section of the department also printed and distributed leaflets entitled "The Premier's Ordeal in Guangzhou is a manifestation of Fearless Spirit" and shouted slogans at the same time, adjourning the meeting at around 11:00 AM.

Handling of Goods Inspection and Water Settlement

### Zhao Daiwen Telegraphs Jin Province Disaster Situation

Selling Wives and Children, Receiving Permits to Flee the Famine

Yesterday, the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association received a telegram from Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, which said (briefly): "I have just learned that you gentlemen have deep compassion and are concerned about those suffering from hunger and drowning. Currently, due to the disasters in Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, and Henan, you are generously providing relief. Furthermore, you are deeply concerned about the severe summer disaster in Shanxi Province. Looking from afar at your virtuous demeanor, I am filled with admiration. An investigation reveals that last spring, over thirty counties in this province were invaded and ravaged by communist bandits, resulting in families being displaced and villages becoming ruins. In areas where the bandits did not reach, the efforts to prepare for defense and provide supplies have exhausted the people's strength and emptied the granaries. In the summer and autumn, we suffered from waterlogging, drought, wind, hail, and insect damage, resulting in disasters in over sixty counties. Although the remaining areas did not experience disasters, the harvests were meager. Suffering from these two disasters within a year, we are fortunate to have received frequent relief funds from the Central Government, and various parties have also made donations. The benefits provided have been praised by all. However, due to limited distribution, it has only barely prevented starvation. We hoped that this summer would bring recovery and celebration, but the drought demon has wreaked havoc, and rainfall has been delayed. Over a hundred counties in the province are once again experiencing widespread drought, especially in southern Shanxi. Since last autumn, there has been a lack of rain, and there was no snow in the winter. The winter wheat was barely sown, and the roots did not develop properly. Since the beginning of spring, strong winds have been frequent, and extreme cold has struck repeatedly. Ninety percent of the wheat seedlings have withered, and much of the cotton has not been sown. Even if it has been sown, the seedlings are extremely sparse and unlikely to grow. On the 18th and 24th and 25th of last month, various counties reported rainfall one after another, but due to the prolonged drought, the rain was insufficient to penetrate the soil, and the season for replanting wheat seedlings has passed, making it difficult to recover. The cotton planting season has also passed. Although we have telegraphed the counties to urge the people to rush to plant autumn crops, there are still several months until the autumn harvest. In the aftermath of this disaster, the people's grain reserves have long been depleted. Eighty to ninety percent of the population are already struggling to survive. They have pawned everything, and there is no way to borrow. Thin wheat paste and porridge are insufficient to fill their hungry stomachs. The digging of grass roots and tree bark is limited. The people of Shanxi attach great importance to their homeland and have deeply ingrained customs. However, recent reports from various counties indicate that impoverished people are receiving permits to flee the famine on a daily basis. Wives and children are scattered, and families are separated. Some are even selling their wives and children or secretly committing suicide. The situation is already this dire at the beginning of summer, and the days ahead are long, making it unbearable. This province is still recovering from the aftermath of the communist bandit attacks, and the provincial treasury is empty, making it impossible to raise funds. We are deeply saddened by the urgent need for relief. In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Relief Committee to request the swift allocation of large amounts of funds for comprehensive relief, we respectfully present the actual situation of the disaster in this province. We sincerely hope that you will vigorously promote and generously provide universal relief. The benevolent soup and righteous grain that you bestow will be remembered by the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in Shanxi for the rest of their lives. I respectfully submit this telegram, awaiting your clear instructions. Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, respectfully bows."

### Chang Zhicheng Telegraphs the Tragic Situation of the Disaster in Western Henan

Yesterday, the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association received a telegram from Chang Zhicheng of the Henan Relief Committee, which said (briefly): "Zhicheng went to western Henan along the Pinghan Railway on the *X*th day of May to survey the disaster situation. He visited twelve counties, including Mixian, Dengfeng, Yanshi, Luoyang, Yiyang, Luoning, Lushi, Wenxiang, Lingbao, Mianchi, and Xinan. Due to the severe drought last year, the wheat was not harvested in the autumn. There was no snow in the winter. The sparsely planted wheat seedlings were also damaged by insects and hail. This year, the wheat is less than a foot tall, with empty ears. Except for a very small number of paddy fields that have yielded a small harvest, the rest is not even enough for seed. Moreover, the wheat is short and thin, unsuitable for seed. Along the way, the tree leaves have been eaten almost entirely. People are emaciated and kneeling and weeping, refusing to leave. Tragedies such as selling wives and children and lying on the tracks to await death are frequently seen. Although it has rained recently, the autumn harvest is still far away. If relief is not continued, all will inevitably starve to death."

### Ministry of Railways Orders Expedited Preparations for Through Train Service Between Shanghai and Guangzhou

Delays in Foreign Materials, Rescheduled Opening for New Year's Day - Both Railway Bureaus Ordered to Complete Preparations Before November

The through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou, a major key to domestic transportation, was originally scheduled to be implemented on the Double Tenth Festival this year after a meeting of the heads of the Aohan, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus in Shanghai this spring. According to information obtained, the service could not be realized on the Double Tenth Festival due to the materials not arriving as scheduled and will be postponed to January 1st of next year. The details are as follows:

Ministry of Railways Orders Expedited Preparations

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus recently received instructions from the Ministry of Railways, stating in brief: "According to the report from the Joint Transportation Department, the through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou was originally scheduled to commence on October 10th of this year. However, due to the replacement of rails on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the foreign sleepers required were delayed in delivery by ship to Shanghai by about two months. The 33 passenger cars ordered by the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways are expected to be completed by the end of this year. Furthermore, the cars attached to this through train service by the Wagons-Lits Company will also be available for use by the end of this year or January of next year. Considering the circumstances of all parties, the commencement date of the through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou must be appropriately postponed. It is proposed to commence the service from January 1st of the 27th year. Please approve or provide instructions on the appropriateness, etc." After investigation, the matters stated are factual and should be approved. In addition to distribution, the railway is hereby ordered to expedite preparations and complete them by the end of this year, and report the progress of preparations at any time, etc. It is now known that the two railway bureaus have ordered the engineering, traffic, mechanical, and materials departments to complete preparations before the end of November of this year.

Through Train Service Between Shanghai and Guangzhou to Connect Five Provinces

Since the active preparations by the various railways for the through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou, the service is expected to commence on New Year's Day next year without any problems. The Qianjiang Bridge in Hangzhou is also expected to be completed in November, and the joint transportation station is also under construction. In the future, after the through train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou is opened, there will be one train per day in each direction, aiming to reach the destination in the shortest possible time. It is expected that the entire journey can be completed within 48 hours. The entire line will connect five provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. The agriculture, industry, and commerce of these provinces are all highly developed. In the future, after the through train service is opened, it will not only be sufficient to regulate the finances of each province and develop the national economy, but it will also greatly facilitate trade between the provinces, such as the transportation of Hunan rice to Guangdong, etc. Therefore, all parties have high hopes and are very optimistic about this.

### Shanghai Literature Exhibition Convened Collectors' Meeting Yesterday

Reporting on Collection Status, Appointing Appraisal Committee

The collection of exhibits for the Shanghai Literature Exhibition is largely complete. Hundreds of items have been received from various locations daily in recent days. The handwritten copy of the *Siku Quanshu* from the Wenlan Pavilion, which previously participated in the Paris Exhibition, is also planned to be solicited this time, as most Chinese people have never seen it. Other items solicited from the ten counties are quite precious, mostly items that people are usually reluctant to show easily. Recently, as the exhibition period coincides with the 10th anniversary of the municipal government, the number of visitors will inevitably be very crowded. All aspects of traffic, hygiene, and protection must be consistent with various other exhibitions. Therefore, some matters have been revised. In addition, as the deadline for receiving exhibits is approaching, matters related to the receipt of items, appraisal procedures, and the opening ceremony need to be discussed urgently. Therefore, the meeting invited the directors of collections from various counties and all executive directors to a meeting yesterday afternoon at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge. Attendees included Chairman Ye Gongchuo, Vice Chairmen Shen Xinqing and Qin Yanqi, Executive Directors Hu Zhaochun, Wu Hufan, Chen Duanzhi, Wu Jingshan, Shen Qinlu, and Lu Danlin, Directors of Collections from various counties Liu Donghai, Qin Bowen, Lei Junyan, Gao Junding, Zhang Jizhai, Zhang Bochou, Shen Xiangzhi, Gu Bingyi, Jin Jushan, Yang Weiyu, Lu Hongnian, and Zhu Kaichou, and Directors of Collections from the city Yao Yuqin, Lin Erqing, Xu Bangda, and Li Zu　, etc. Chairman Ye presided over the meeting. First, the chairman reported briefly that the deadline for receiving items from the association is approaching. In order to understand the collection status of each county and enable those responsible in each county to exchange opinions, he has invited everyone to a meeting again today. At the same time, he plans to report on the recent situation of the meeting to everyone, and some other matters are also planned to be discussed with everyone. Now, he will explain the reporting items one by one. ❶ Regarding the receipt of exhibits, as of yesterday afternoon, in addition to many items sent by institutions, organizations, and individuals, Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou have also sent the complete catalogs of exhibits. From the ten counties, Jiading, Jinshan, and Taicang have sent the first batch of more than 500 items. Songjiang, Baoshan, Fengxian, Qingpu, and Shanghai have also sent the first batch of registration forms for more than 600 types of items. As of yesterday, a total of 849 items have been received in the classics category, 236 items in the calligraphy and painting category, 70 items in the image category, 80 items in the epigraphy category, 94 items in the historical materials category, and 92 items in the local worthy relics category, totaling 1,571 items in the six categories. There are also more than 2,200 types of items for which letters have been received reporting them but registration forms have not been received. It is expected that by the deadline on the 20th, the total number of exhibits will be more than 5,000. In order to avoid duplication in the exhibits of each category, after receiving the exhibit form, the association will first check and notify the exhibitors to remove any duplicates. Therefore, the association has actually received exhibit forms from various places for more than 3,500 items. Even with the current exhibits received in each category, there are many precious items. The members of the association should be very grateful to the exhibitors and collectors. ❷ Regarding the deadline for receiving items, various places have requested an extension. The office, due to the cumbersome procedures, will still limit the deadline to the 20th, as any further delay will affect the opening date. If there are a few precious exhibits that cannot be completed in time due to the reorganization procedures, please notify the office in advance, and it can be delayed by one or two days. It is hoped that this batch of exhibits will still be sent to the association by the 20th. Please pass this on to the solicitors. ❸ The association has specially formulated measures for consignment of books and items in response to the requests of exhibitors and major bookstores from various places, which have been published in the newspapers. Today, the measures will be distributed to everyone. If anyone asks the association to sell on consignment, please contact the office before the 25th of this month. ❹ The expenses incurred by the directors of collections and helpers from various places for liaison must be high. The association is also limited by funds and cannot pay for each one individually. However, the association should pay for the funds used to transport exhibits to the association. Please ask the directors of collections from various counties, whether they personally or send someone to transport the exhibits to the association, to collect the funds from the office and not be polite. The assistance provided by various places to the association has been infinitely grateful, both in spirit and in material. It is planned to compile a special publication after the exhibition to leave a permanent memorial to repay everyone's kindness in assisting the association this time. ❺ When conducting collections in various places, most have separately organized a solicitation committee and established an office and a receiving office, and temporarily hired specialists to handle investigation, interviews, collation, registration, and other work. The enthusiasm is unprecedented. Furthermore, counties such as Fengxian plan to take this opportunity to hold a county's literature exhibition to conduct a preliminary review and arouse local interest in literature and historical sites. The speaker plans to plan a program to preserve and promote the literature and historical sites of the ten counties after the association is closed. At that time, he will discuss the details with the people of the county. Since Shanghai is a major port in the country and the city with the most international contact, things are changing very quickly and have the greatest impact on the country. The counties are all neighboring counties of Shanghai, and in the past, they were all under the jurisdiction of Song and Tai. They have a linked relationship in space and time. Literature is the mother of all things. Now that we have held this exhibition, we should further plan how to make the inherent civilization of the ten counties flourish and how to make the future culture of the ten counties advance together with other things. It is hoped that everyone present today sympathizes with this attempt. Next, Wu Hufan of Shanghai City, Qin Bowen of Shanghai County, Gao Junding of Jinshan, Lei Junyan of Songjiang, Gu Bingyi of Nanhui, Zhang Hongnian of Jiading, Zhu Kaichou of Taicang, Jin Jushan of Baoshan, Zhang Jizhai of Qingpu, and Zhang Bochou of Chuansha successively reported. In general, each county solicited more than 1,000 items, and at least 100 or 200 items. Each county has precious exhibits. Finally, Cai Jiemin, Ye Yuhu, Wang Yiting, Niu Tixian, Zhang Jusheng, Liu Yazi, Shen Xinqing, Qin Yanqi, Chen Taoyi, Teng Ruoqu, Ding Fuzhi, Wu Hufan Yao Yuqin, and Pang Laichen, and fourteen others were elected as members of the appraisal committee. The meeting adjourned at about 3:00 PM.

### Military Affairs Commission Issues Order to Seriously Handle Drug Cases

Must Carefully Investigate with Intention of Prudence

The Shanghai Municipal Government recently received an order from the Military Affairs Commission, which stated in brief: "The Temporary Regulations for the Prohibition of Drugs and Punishment of Crimes stipulate in Article 8 that, from the 26th year of the Republic of China, those who commit the crime of manufacturing, transporting, selling, or using drugs shall be sentenced to death. The legislation is strict, but many ignorant people still defy the law and attempt to use drugs. Those who are excusable may apply the provisions of the criminal law to reduce their sentences. However, those who abandon themselves to depravity and despise the law cannot be deterred without extreme punishment. Hereafter, the drug trial organs in each province, city, and county must handle drug cases seriously and investigate carefully, so that in the midst of strictness, there is still an intention of prudence." After receiving this order, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the Police Bureau to comply.

### Three World-Renowned Musicians Come to Shanghai

Will Perform at the Nanjing Theater Soon

The *North China Daily News* reports that three world-renowned musicians will arrive in Shanghai soon to perform at the Nanjing Theater. One is the pianist Mr. Mirowitch, one is the violinist Mr. Piatigorsky, and one is the double bassist Mr. Schuster. Mr. Mirowitch is one of the senior American pianists who has performed in major cities in the United States and has toured the world eight times. He has repeatedly visited European capitals and is very popular. Mr. Piatigorsky is currently the solo violinist and music director of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He is often conducted by the world's most famous conductors, such as Mr. Toscanini, and performs. He and the famous violinist Mr. Elman studied under Mr. Wall. Since 1931, he has performed with Mr. Toscanini until Mr. Toscanini's retirement. Mr. Schuster is currently the solo double bassist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and was also a giant in the music industry in the past. In 1917, Mr. Piatigorsky and Mr. Mirowitch came to Shanghai to join the music class hastily assembled by Mr. Percy. The establishment of the music class by the Shanghai Municipal Council was due in part to the elegant rhythm of the two gentlemen, which aroused the musical interest of the people of Shanghai. The three masters plan to jointly demonstrate their high skills at the Nanjing Theater on the 24th of this month. The first half of the program will be solo performances, and the second half will be ensemble performances. It is expected that another day will be scheduled to perform with the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra. The gathering of three masters in one hall is a rare and beautiful opportunity. It is thought that connoisseurs of Western and Chinese music in Shanghai will wash their ears and listen carefully.

### Children's Welfare Society Sends Personnel to Investigate the Truth About the Human-Faced Spider

The Human-Faced Spider is Displayed at the Family Exhibition - Played by Adults, No Harm to Children

The Shanghai Chinese Children's Welfare Association has always attached great importance to cases of child abuse. Recently, it suddenly received a letter reporting that the human-faced spider on display at the Improved Family Exhibition held at the racecourse was created by destroying children's limbs, twisting and transforming them. The association, which is responsible for children's welfare, should pay attention to it, etc. After receiving the report, the association immediately sent personnel to visit Mr. Alfred, a Westerner from Chengdu Road who is responsible for supervising the holding of the Improved Family Exhibition. According to Mr. Alfred, he had reviewed the entire exhibition beforehand and there was absolutely no such thing as destroying children's limbs. Subsequently, Mr. Zhao Jian, the association's protection officer, personally went to the exhibition to investigate and learned that the so-called human-faced spider was played by adults standing behind the scenes and performing various postures. Due to the scientific effect of light changes, a phantasm of a human face suspended in the air occurred. In fact, there was no harm to children. A certain gentleman sent a report to the Children's Welfare Association out of enthusiasm, but in terms of facts, it seems that he has not fully understood the situation.

### What is the Intention of the Bandits Who Hijacked the Car?

At about 5:00 AM yesterday, a man wearing a white-gray long gown and speaking with a Chongming accent rented a car from the Meihua Motor Company on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession, saying that he wanted to go to a certain place in Zhabei to visit the company's accountant. He often ordered the driver, Huang Zhixiang, to drive the passenger car with license number Hua Zhao 4450. When he reached the western end of Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, the passenger suddenly ordered the car to stop. Four people jumped out from the roadside, two wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, and two wearing black long gowns. They ordered the driver to get out of the car, and two of them drove the car away. Two others monitored the driver's actions and said that the car would be back in a little while. After a while, two people returned and told the driver not to make a fuss and left. After the bandits had gone far away, Huang Zhixiang ran to report to the Caojiadu Police Station in charge, and notified the Meihua Motor Company by telephone. The company reported to the Laoza Police Station on the one hand, and went to the Caojiadu Police Station to inquire on the other hand. Unexpectedly, not long after, the car was found near the Pingmin Village on Pushan Road in Zhabei. Someone reported it to the Sun Temple Police Station, which forwarded it to the Xinzha Police Station. The car was driven back to the police station. The Xinzha Police Station then notified the Meihua Motor Company by telephone, and sent personnel to Zhabei with the Laoza Police Station to retrieve the car. However, the purpose of the bandits renting the car is unknown, and the police station has reported the situation to the Inspectorate of the Police Headquarters for record.

### The Truth About the Tragic Overturn of the Wuxi-Shanghai Bus

Three Passengers and One Driver Seriously Injured, All Other Passengers Safe

The Datong News Agency reports that the No. 47 bus of the Wuxi-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Company unfortunately overturned on the way from Changshu to Wuxi in the early morning, causing a tragedy. The Datong News Agency reporter recorded the truth from the company as follows:

Departing from Changshu to Wuxi

The No. 4th local bus on the Changshu-Wuxi section of the Wuxi-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus departed from Changshu for Wuxi at 8:25 AM on the morning before. There were more than a dozen passengers on board at the Changshu station. After the bus reached Dongting and other stations, passengers continued to board. The total number of passengers on the bus before the accident was 25. The vehicle was driven by Jiang Jinchu (28 years old, from Danyang). According to reports, Jiang is very skilled in driving.

Overturned on the Way

When the bus passed the Guiting Station and drove between Bridge No. 3 and No. 4 at the western end, the road surface was muddy due to light rain at the time, and at the same time, it overturned in a hurry to avoid pedestrians, resulting in a tragic overturning. The wheels of the bus were facing the sky and fell to the side of the road. Fortunately, it was spotted by passers-by, who came forward to break the car windows and rescue the passengers and the driver from danger. At the same time, they rushed to report to the Guiting Station, which notified Sun Baokang, the station manager of Wuxi Station, by telephone.

Four People Seriously Injured

An examination of the passengers showed that Huang Yinmin (Captain of the Military Training Team of the Ministry of Railways), Shi Minyong (Commissioner of the Changshu Anti-Smoking Committee), and Zhu Kun (Student Military Training Office of Zhenjiang) were seriously injured. All three were injured in the chest and front ribs. At the same time, the driver, Jiang Jinchu, was also seriously injured in the chest (sent to Changshu Hospital). As for the remaining passengers, they were squeezed against each other after the overturn. Although there were minor injuries, they were not affected. At that time, the Wuxi station had already been alerted and immediately dispatched vehicles to pick up all the passengers and send them to Wuxi. After arriving in Wuxi, the three injured passengers were sent to Puren Hospital for treatment. The remaining passengers returned separately.

Headquarters Investigation

After receiving the news, the Shanghai Zhabei Headquarters immediately sent the traffic director, Zhou Zhongyi, to Wuxi at 3:00 AM on the morning before to investigate the truth of the accident and to comfort the injured passengers who were receiving treatment. He returned to Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. It was found that the accident occurred as described above. As for the overturned bus, it has been damaged and was towed to Shanghai for repairs at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. There was no loss of luggage, etc.

### Dying of Untreated Lung Disease, Committing Suicide by Opium

The deceased was a Tianyi Actor, Coffin and Burial Arranged by Company Colleagues

Sun Pinglang, a 25-year-old actor from Hangzhou with the Tianyi Film Company, had been suffering severely from lung disease recently. He sought treatment but it was ineffective, causing him great suffering. On the day before yesterday, he suddenly had the thought of ending his life. Alone, he went to the Jue Lu Hotel at 250 Yu Qiaqing Road, booked room number 66, and secretly consumed a large amount of opium to commit suicide. Later, a tea server at the hotel discovered him while cleaning. The case was reported to the Lao Zha Patrol Station, and an ambulance was summoned to the scene. He was rushed to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He died around 8:00 PM that evening. An investigator was dispatched to investigate and had the body transported to the Philantrophy Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, along with forensic doctors, visited the morgue to examine the body. According to the statement from the tea server, who worked at Jue Lu Hotel, the deceased arrived to book a room at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Around 5:00 PM, he wrote four letters and asked me to mail them. At that time, I saw his face had turned pale and knew something was wrong. So, I took the letters to the front desk to report to the staff. After they opened and read the letters, they realized he had taken poison and immediately reported it to the police, who sent him to the hospital, etc. Furthermore, according to Shen Yarlun and Fei Lun, who claimed to be colleagues of the deceased, they were notified by the police that he had taken poison. Recently, he had been on leave due to lung disease. As for whether he had any family, he never mentioned it, so they did not know. Now, the company colleagues are willing to contribute to arrange for the coffin and burial, and the two of us are here to represent the company to claim the body. Mr. Song approved this and instructed that the body be handed over to Shen and Fei to take away for the coffin and burial.

### Liu Songkun Embezzles Over Ten Thousand US Dollars Recounts Absurd Experience Contracts Venereal Disease, Falls for a Beauty Trap

Thousand US Dollars Stolen by Fellow Townsman, Case Investigation Concluded, Sentence Scheduled for 23rd

Liu Songkun, a Cantonese man also known as Paul Old Kun, 25 years old, served at the Thomas Cook Travel Agency at 49 Nanjing Road after graduating from St. Francis College. On November 6th last year, Liu was instructed by his manager, a Westerner named Keaden, to mail 5,000 US dollars (equivalent to 16,750 Chinese currency) to Citibank in New York. However, Liu took the opportunity to steal the US dollars and replaced them with blank paper to mail. Liu also resigned before the incident came to light, using the embezzled money to travel to various scenic spots. He was recently arrested by detectives Sun Jishan and Han Shoushan of the General Patrol Station in Qinghefang, Hangzhou, and brought back to Shanghai, and detained by the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. During the adjournment, Liu confessed to the police about the various circumstances after embezzling the money, stating that after stealing the money, he first went to various dance halls in Shanghai, spending over a thousand dollars. Then, he took the Shanghai-Beiping train to Beiping and then to Tianjin, staying at the Huizhong Hotel. One night, he suddenly heard a woman crying in the next room, very sadly. He asked the tea server what happened. He was told that the person in the next room was a Cantonese woman named Chen Xiuzhen who came to Tianjin to look for relatives but was unsuccessful and lacked the funds to return home. Liu was moved by hometown sentiments and offered to accompany her back to Guangdong. That night, they took a train to Shanghai and stayed at the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road, waiting for a ship to Guangdong. However, when he woke up, the woman had disappeared, and the thousand US dollars in Liu's pocket had also been stolen. Liu realized he had been deceived but dared not make a sound. Thereupon, he returned to Tianjin to play, staying at the White Palace Hotel. The hotel had a dance hall, and Liu indulged in it all day long without restraint. Then he traveled to various scenic spots in Beijing and Shanghai. In Jiaxing, he contracted smallpox due to frequenting prostitutes and went to Hangzhou for medical treatment, where he was caught by the detectives. The stolen money had all been spent. Yesterday morning, this case was heard again in the Criminal Court One by Judge Qian Hongye. Liu confessed to the fact of replacing the US dollars with blank paper. After arguments between the police lawyer Ru Baoji and the defendant's lawyer Ge Zhaoji, the court concluded the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for next Wednesday (i.e., the 23rd).

The case has been interrogated twice by Judge Chen of the District Court and has been debated to the end. The verdict was announced yesterday (16th) at 10:00 AM. The main text was that Gong Jingyan, Hong Sheng, and Mei Lanqing were all innocent, and the incidental civil suit was dismissed.

### Philips Company Comprador Embezzles Over 100,000 Yuan

Wanted for Five Years, Recently Arrested. Shu Chengrong Claims It Was Owed by His Deceased Brother

Shu Chengrong, a Ningbo native, 38 years old, was a comprador for the Shanghai Philips Electrical Materials Company at 41 Sichuan Road. From July to August of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), he successively embezzled 109,000 yuan of the company's funds and absconded without a trace. The company reported it to the police, requesting the Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. After many years, it was not until 1:30 PM the day before yesterday that Shu Chengrong was arrested by Huishi Patrol Station detective Shang Wu and detective Zhao Ziduo at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chongqing Road, brought to the patrol station, and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court Eight of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhiyou filed a public prosecution according to Article 336, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for embezzlement and stated the case, saying that the Philips Company was opened by a Dutchman. At first, they hired the defendant's brother, Shu Chengde, as a comprador, who was very diligent and gained the trust of his superiors. After Chengde died, the defendant took over, with a monthly salary of 250 yuan. On August 29th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the defendant suddenly left his job. At the same time, a letter from the defendant's appointed lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, stated that his brother had a lot of debts while in office. At the beginning of his tenure, the defendant originally intended to find a way to make up for it, but because the electric bulb part of the company was handled by others, his monthly income decreased, and he was affected by the Shanghai War, making it impossible to make up for it. Now he is trying to raise money outside, etc. After receiving the letter, the company was very suspicious. After investigation, it was found that the defendant had embezzled more than 100,000 yuan of the company's funds, so they reported it to the police. The defendant's method of embezzlement was that the company had buying and selling customers who could pay within three months. The defendant handled a large number of these customers. After the defendant collected the money from the customers, he did not immediately hand it over to the company but deposited it in various banks himself. Later, because the company's demand was very strict, the defendant issued bad checks, with the deadline being the end of August. The defendant suddenly left, causing all the checks to be unredeemable, totaling about 109,000 yuan. He was arrested yesterday after a warrant issued from the Special Court, the suspect was living at 18 Yuanji Lane, Tangshan Road, however he was not found. The defendant only admitted to using 40,000 yuan of the company's funds privately. His guarantor has already compensated 7,500 yuan of the funds. Now, because the amount is too different, it is requested to postpone the hearing. According to the complaint of Fugen, the accountant of the Philips Company, a German, the checks issued by the defendant, the Chinese comprador, when he left, totaled more than 100,000 yuan, all of which could not be cashed. When questioned, the defendant stated that he was a clerk in the company in the 11th year of the Republic of China and a comprador in the 16th year of the Republic of China, but all of this money was owed by the runner employed by his late brother. His lawyer, Yu Xiangqin, stated that the comprador is fully responsible for all customer funds, whether they have been collected or not. According to this situation, it does not involve criminal matters. The police should investigate this point during the postponement. Judge Chuan Lin verified the confession and instructed the defendant to be remanded in custody, pending a re-examination in seven days.

### Repeated Injections to Prevent Fetal Toxicity Lead to Child's Death

Autopsy Results Show Death from Acute Poisoning, Guanghua Hospital Director and Doctor Accused

Wang Xianzong, 42, from Hefei, Anhui, owner of Renji Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 138 Yangjia Du Street, Pudong, and his wife, Liu, 34, had given birth to seven or eight children, only three of whom survived. The eldest son is 15 years old, the youngest is three years old, and the third child was born on February 26th of this year. However, the three-year-old child suffered from fetal toxicity after birth. Wang himself had suffered from syphilis ten years ago and was cured, but he feared that it would not be completely eradicated and would be passed on to his wife and children. Therefore, when his wife, Liu, was about six or seven months pregnant, around November of last year, Wang accompanied his wife, Liu, to the Shanghai Guanghua Hospital at No. 101-103-105 Baliqiao Street, French Concession, for treatment. The director and doctor of the hospital, Qian Wenhui (31 years old, from Wuxi), treated her with 606 injections. However, Wang was still afraid that the child would be infected with fetal toxicity after birth, so he asked Dr. Qian to make an appointment to bring the child for treatment after it was born. On February 26th of this year, Wang Liu gave birth to a full-term baby boy, named Xiao Niu, who was chubby and cute. In the middle of last month, the child's face suddenly developed blisters and a skin disease with yellow pus. Wang feared that this disease was fetal toxicity, so on the first day of this month, he carried Xiao Niu across the river to Shanghai and went to the Shanghai Guanghua Hospital for treatment. Qian Wenhui's assistant, Wan Xuanqing (30 years old, from Wuxi), gave him a half cc injection of blood-clearing medicine and applied medicine to the affected area, making an appointment for another injection in two weeks and vaccinating him in the second half of the year to ensure that he would never have sores or boils. After returning home, the child's face gradually cleared up. On the 15th day, Wang, following the doctor's instructions, had his wife, Wang Liu, carry the child and a neighbor across the river to Guanghua Hospital at 9:00 AM, arriving at 10:00 AM. Wan Xuanqing gave him another 0.8 cc injection of blood-clearing medicine. Unexpectedly, five minutes later, the child suddenly changed, his eyes rolled back, his mouth and nose turned blue, and his breathing was rapid, in a very dangerous state. The hospital director and doctor, Qian Wenhui, examined him and administered artificial respiration and a heart-strengthening injection, but it was ineffective. In the end, because the child was weak, he could not resist the potency of the medicine and died at 5:00 PM that afternoon. The child's mother ordered someone to notify the child's father, Wang Xianzong, who learned that Wan Xuanqing, who gave the injection, did not have a doctor's license or permit and rashly treated and injected people. The hospital director, Qian Wenhui, did not examine the child beforehand and ordered his assistant to give the injection, causing his beloved son to lose his life. Overwhelmed with grief, he reported it to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate, arrested Qian Wenhui and Wan Xuanqing, and sent the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch Hall for examination. At noon yesterday, he reported to Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Jiang, for examination. First, Chinese and Western detectives reported the case and the investigation process, and the needle and medicine bottle were presented in the case. Then, according to the child's father, Wang Xianzong, the child had a history of two injections, and he said that the last injection was a white liquid, and this injection was a yellow liquid. When questioned, Qian Wenhui and Wan Xuanqing said that the child's mother had syphilis and came for injections to treat it, and the child was feared to have inherited syphilis, and after the last injection, the disease was feared to have entered the heart, causing the change and death after this injection. Then, the two forensic doctors dissected the body and found that the heart did not have any disease phenomena. It was indeed caused by acute poisoning. The official ordered the body to be handed over to his father for burial. The defendants, Qian Wenhui and Wan Xuanqing, were sent to the Medical Affairs Office for legal action. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the police sent the two defendants to the Second Special Court, where Judge Liao Yun presided over the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated that the defendants caused death due to negligence in their duties. The police investigation was not completed, and a request was made to postpone the interrogation. Then, the plaintiff, Wang Xianzong, testified about the child's death from the injection. After questioning the defendants, the court ordered a postponement to the 23rd for another interrogation. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Sichuan Store Prints and Distributes Silver Ear Fungus Test Report

The Sichuan Store in this port is famous in Shanghai for specializing in Sichuan silver ear fungus and all Sichuan native products. The store believes that although silver ear fungus is known as a supreme tonic, in this era of scientific prosperity, there should be detailed scientific tests to accurately confirm its benefits to the public. The store previously submitted the silver ear fungus produced in its own mountains to the Shanghai Hygiene Testing Institute and Mr. Hu Shijun of the Science Society of China for two tests. The results confirmed that the chemical components contained in it are more nourishing than any other medicine, and silver ear fungus does not have the drawbacks of being biased or greasy and is suitable for consumption in all seasons. It is recognized as the most superior domestic tonic. The store has now compiled the information on the silver ear fungus tests into an accurate and faithful written report, with extremely detailed and reasonable content. If various circles wish to read it, they can write to the Sichuan Store's main store on Nanjing Road or its branch store on Polling Grounds.

### On "Human Nature"

— V

We often hear people talk about the term "human nature," but what exactly is human nature? And what kind of behavior can be considered not to violate human nature? Sometimes it is indeed difficult to explain.

For example, let's take the example before us. He Shigen, a native of Changzhou, had four sons, all of whom died of illness. According to folk superstition, this is because "ghosts of premature death" come to collect debts. In April of this year, his daughter, He Laigui, also suffered from lung disease, which naturally seems to be the work of "ghosts of premature death." Therefore, in a moment of desperation, he carried He Laigui to the entrance of an alley and hacked her to death with a kitchen knife. Unexpectedly, the local constable, Shen Heshang, found out, reported it to the authorities for inspection, and it was confirmed to be true. He was then prosecuted for the crime of homicide under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law.

Logically, He Shigen did not hesitate to personally kill his own daughter with a knife. This is naturally a violation of human nature. In China, although infanticide has become a common practice, it is still not permitted by law, let alone killing one's own flesh and blood. However, his motive for killing was entirely due to his children's high mortality rate, to prevent future children from dying prematurely. That is why he used cruel means on his daughter who was sick and about to die. If we talk about human nature, there is also the original human nature here. He did not kill for personal gain, but for the highest continuation of the race. From the perspective of the old Chinese society, not only was there discrimination in the treatment of men and women, but the concept of "there are three unfilial acts, and the greatest is to have no offspring" was also deeply rooted in the minds of the general public. Therefore, He Shigen, because he had no sons, in a moment of desperation, hacked his own daughter to death. In the depths of this behavior, isn't there also a hidden current of "human nature"?

We must believe in the existence of human nature, but we also know that its existence is not static. In certain extraordinary circumstances, there can be astonishing changes. Savages, due to their weak productive forces, had to put the elderly in their tribes to death. But this motive was due to the lack of productive forces. Some may say that this is the morality of savages, and it does not apply to civilized societies. Well, let me give you another example from a civilized society.

Currently, there is a great famine in Sichuan. Some women take their children and go out to beg. Because they cannot get enough to eat, they have to abandon their children on the way. In the eyes of the gentlemen, this is probably also an event that violates human nature, right?

But this is true human nature! In the hearts of the common people. They only know to do what their heart tells them, and they never know what hypocrisy is.

### Black People

— Luo Caiqing

The impression that black people give us seems to be very bad. It's from the black people seen in many American movies. Their ears are adorned with large earrings that hang almost to their shoulders, and their noses also have nose rings piercing them. When they speak, it's a jumble, making people unhappy to see them. However, they are "devoted to their duties until their death" to their white masters. Isn't the reason why those so-called adventure films are filmed again and again, in addition to the grasp of the "business eye," also to promote the privileges of their "civilized people"?

So, I thought of Lincoln. In 1776, the American Declaration of Independence declared the principle of equality and freedom for mankind. In 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. However, the historical records are just words on paper. Black people are still the "loyal servants" of white people, although the name is much more pleasant than "slaves."

However, being able to be a "loyal servant" of the master is still a "lucky one" among black people. After all, they can still stand with white people and chat. Others who want to be "loyal servants" but cannot, are subject to "civilized laws" that stipulate a "special zone" in the back of streetcars and buses for black people to ride in. Even in schools and waiting rooms at parking lots, black people are not allowed to mix with white people. In theaters, if a black person intrudes into a white person's seat, they are usually subjected to "lynching."

What kind of punishment is "lynching"? According to a telegram from Grenada, Missouri, USA, last month: Several black people here were arrested and imprisoned for the crime of murdering a white merchant. More than a hundred people went to the prison, seized the black people, and lynched them, that is, tied each of the black people to a post and burned them with firewood. "Mixing with white people" involves the risk of being subjected to "lynching," and "murdering white people" is, of course, an unforgivable crime.

When this news is publicized in newspapers, on the one hand, it does show the "heroic might" of white people, but there are also some "advocates of justice" who feel that holding "racial prejudice" is not without its problems. Yesterday's newspaper contained this "crying wolf" style telegram from Montgomery, Alabama, USA, saying that nine black people accused of insulting two white women on a freight train in 1931 were initially sentenced to death. One of them, Patterson, was spared the electric chair after a fourth retrial in January 1936, due to the advocacy of justice by local officials who held racial prejudices, and the assistance of various groups. He was resentenced to 75 years in prison, which was approved by the Supreme Court today (the 14th). When reading this news, at first I felt that there were still people in this world who "advocated justice," and that this "justice" was for black people. Then, I suddenly started calculating Patterson's age. After 75 years, what kind of monster will he become? And what about the other eight? Where has "justice" gone? Of course, we don't need to delve into the crimes they committed, because other than being a "loyal servant" waiting before the master, any other actions can be subjected to "lynching." Insulting white women is, of course, a very serious crime.

However, because of the insult to women, I am reminded of something. It was two or three weeks ago that two "civilized" sailors gang-raped a tour guide. At first, they quibbled, but after the police sent someone to arrest them, they paid tens of dollars to settle the matter! It was treated as if there had been no gang rape. Gang rape is probably the worst kind of "insult to women." Perhaps those black people don't have such courage, but the "civilized people" who set down some "lynching" laws for black people are the real criminals. After reading so much news about "civilized people" holding "racial prejudice" against black people, do we ever think about the fate of us yellow people? The dream of trusting "advocates of justice" has long been shattered. Only "master" is "law"!

### Miao Festival

— You Qi

After several sunny days, the sun showed its fierce face again. The exchange of light and heat is distressing, and the sky is cloudless for thousands of miles. The city walls suppress the foothills of the distant mountains. Occasionally, apart from Miao women using skilled words to sell wild fruits from the mountains, letting sharp tones sweep across the sky, the city would have no clamor at all.

Across from me, the friend's mansion employs two assimilated 　Jia Miao. It has been five or six years since they were hired. Whether in dress or language, one cannot find any traces of the Miao people. She has a kind and patient personality, and at the same time cherishes bright ideals. Her husband is about the same age as her. When there are festivals or new moons, he sometimes brings the children to the city. But although they have been assimilated on the surface, they are still very fluent in their native language.

These two days are a bit strange. Her clothes have changed. Like other Miao people, she has thick leggings wrapped around her legs. Her upper garment can cover below her hips, and she wears three or four silver necklaces around her neck. It seems that the weight is not light, reflecting the sunlight dazzlingly. As usual, she has the mission of delivering snacks when the friend's family makes them. This day, she was dressed neatly, went upstairs, and was full of joy!

"Why don't you go to see the Miao Festival, young master?" She is also used to getting straight to the point, set up afterwards, seems to feel not completely, then added a few words: "It's on Guangdong Street, these two days are exactly lively time."

The Miao Festival gives us great interest, why is it being celebrated? She didn't have time to answer, and hurried away. Afterwards, we also hurried over. Without walking to the central location, upon entering the street entrance, people's faces wore happy smiles, layer upon layer surrounding the core. Lusheng, flutes, drums... interplayed with each other, scattering a different tune that is rarely heard, spreading and overflowing to every corner.

Squeezing and squeezing, sweat droplets like many bright beads, stuck to the scorched forehead and chin. This, does not attract attention, necks are stretched very long, and toes are standing, it would be best to grow two pairs of hooks on the eyes, so you can hook the essence of the action inside.

The festival site is not small, this street is completely cut off from traffic. The Miao people participating in the festival, men, women, old and young, are all present, and the clothing is also bizarre and colorful, especially on young women, it is even more dazzling and competitive. Some have dozens of necklaces, and many odds and ends are carved on the circles. If you estimate the weight, it should be more than five or six pounds. It seems that something is far away inside, because of the squeezing, I can't see clearly. It is said that this place is not limited to a certain ethnic group. All those living nearby should participate in the festival.

Afterwards, I heard from the Miao woman employed in my friend's house that because the Miao people's leader was buried here, in order to commemorate his achievements, there are three days of worship every year, and his birthday is used as the date of the worship, so the date will never change. As for the leader's name and deeds, because of the long years, she can't remember them clearly either. Finally, she said that the day we visited was already the last day, otherwise, we would have to wait for another year of hot weather!

Heat, cast down flames, in the flames, we received the great ceremony.
