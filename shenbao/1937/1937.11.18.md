### On the National Defense Line, a Great Battle is Imminent: Our Troops in Jiaxing Divided into Three Routes to Meet the Enemy

The Battle Situation Has Been Fierce for Days; Our Front Line Remains Immovable. Our Troops on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Still Hold Zhengyi and Weiting. The Rumor That Fushan Has Fallen is False; Both Sides Are Engaged in Bloody Combat.

The enemy landed in Hangzhou Bay and, after capturing Jiashan along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, launched a full-scale assault on Jiaxing on the 16th. Our troops fought valiantly, repeatedly repelling the strong enemy. Large numbers of enemy planes bombed indiscriminately, destroying most of the civilian houses. Our front line remained immovable. The enemy's left flank attacked our line at Zhapu and Pinghu, while the right flank took the route through Xitang Town and invaded Pingwang, attempting to cut off our connection between Suzhou and Jiaxing. The battle situation has been exceptionally fierce for days, with heavy casualties on both sides. Pinghu and Zhapu were once in a very critical situation. Yesterday afternoon, after our fresh troops arrived to reinforce, the situation has turned from danger to safety. On the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway front, we still hold the line at Zhengyi and Weiting. The enemy launched a vigorous attack from Kunshan, but was repelled. At the same time, the enemy landed at Baimao Estuary and other places, advancing along multiple routes to attack Changshu. Fierce fighting took place near the suburbs. Our troops were ordered to defend to the death, and large reinforcements gathered. The enemy attacked fiercely for two days and nights, but ultimately failed. Of the enemy's torpedo boats anchored in Shanghai, two suddenly sailed out of the Wusong Estuary at dawn yesterday, heading towards the Changshu and Jiangyin areas of the Yangtze River, seemingly with other intentions. The rumor that Fushan has fallen is absolutely inaccurate. Our troops are resisting strongly, and both sides are still engaged in close combat.

### Various Routes Engage in Bloody Combat

Military intelligence indicates that our military authorities consider the Shanghai battle situation to have completely shifted to the national defense line. Although the enemy is advancing step by step, our side has long been prepared for this line. Military deployments have been completed, and a great battle will be launched within days to fight to the death with the enemy. The day before yesterday afternoon, the enemy attacked Changshu along multiple routes, and fierce fighting broke out in the southeastern suburbs of the city. At the same time, many enemy warships gathered on the Fushan river surface, bombarding the Fushan defense area to cover the landing of ground troops, attempting to attack Changshu from the side. Our troops are fighting hard to block them. The line from Changshu to Zhengyi, along the Dahengjing River and the highlands east of Yangcheng Lake, is very strongly fortified. Zhengyi south to Pingwang is connected with Suzhou, forming a tripod-like situation with close communication. The enemy at Pingwang attempted to flee north along the railway line the day before yesterday, attempting to pressure Suzhou. They are currently being tightly blocked by us at Shenghu and Tangjiahu, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them. The enemy invading Jiaxing from the southeast of Jiashan reached the Qixing Bridge and Shibalipu Bridge area the day before yesterday, but were immediately ambushed by our troops, with many enemies killed. They no longer dare to advance.

### Our Troops Hold the Xinzhucun Defense Line

[Nanjing, Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters] According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army has consolidated the front line of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway after obtaining fresh troops. The Chinese army is now holding a front line of approximately 90 miles, from Pukou on the edge of the Yangtze River to Zhapu, passing through Changshu, Zhengyi, Qingpu, Jiaxing, and Pinghu. It is said that the deployment of the new front line has been completed.

### Three Routes of Invasion; Fierce Battle Situation

[Hangzhou, Central News Agency, 16th] The enemy landed in Hangzhou Bay and, on the 16th, advanced along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road towards Jiaxing. The left flank attacked our line at Zhapu and Pinghu, and the right flank took the route through Xitang Town and invaded Pingwang. The battle situation on all three routes is fierce. Our positions have not changed much.

### Fierce Fighting Breaks Out in Zhengyi and Jiashan

[Suzhou, Central News Agency, 17th] On the eastern battlefield, after our troops held the new defense line, the enemy continued to attack fiercely. Fierce fighting broke out in Zhengyi and the southwest area of Jiashan. Jiaxing is being firmly defended by our side. As for Langshan and Fushan, enemy warships are constantly firing at the west bank to harass, but have not landed.

### More Than 3,000 Enemy Reinforcements Arrive

Central News Agency: Yesterday morning (17th) at 6:00 AM, the ninth batch of the enemy's seventh reinforcement army, more than 3,000 people, arrived in Shanghai on four enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships: No. 66 Asu Maru, No. 170 So-yo Maru, No. 16 Hinode Maru, and No. 28 Singapore Maru. They docked at the Osaka, Huangpu, and Hongkou wharves respectively, landed, and were transported to the front by enemy-prepared military trucks.

Around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy ironclad ship Asahi, with a displacement of over 14,000 tons, sailed into Shanghai and is now moored at buoy No. 8 in the port.

### Large Quantities of Military Supplies Transported by the Enemy

Small Motorboats, Bamboo Rafts, and Timber

Central News Agency: Yesterday morning (17th), five enemy transport ships, No. 64 Taitai Maru, No. 146 Magasusa Maru, No. 24 Bayo Maru, No. 204 Shokoku Maru, and No. 162 Kayo Maru, successively sailed into Shanghai, carrying more than 200 small motorboats and large quantities of ammunition and food.

Around noon yesterday, five more enemy transport ships, Matsumaru, Saimaru, Sanwa Maru, No. 13 Unkai Maru, and another transport ship with an unknown name, sailed into Shanghai, docking at the China Merchants Bureau's Hua Wharf and the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong, carrying large quantities of bamboo rafts and timber. It is said that they will be transported to the upper reaches of the Wusong River within days to be used as river-crossing tools.

### Japanese Reporter Describes the Tragic Situation of River Crossing Sacrifices

And Praises Our Communication Trench Works

The Osaka Asahi Shimbun published on the 10th of this month a special dispatch from Saito and Hamano stating that at 10:00 AM on the 9th, the reporters, along with Commander Kawanami's unit, crossed the south bank of the Suzhou River. Recalling that within a week, our army (referring to the Japanese army) suffered countless casualties in this river, we were deeply saddened. When a light pontoon bridge was first erected, it was attacked by the enemy army (referring to our army), and 200 loyal and brave soldiers completely fell into the water and drowned. At the same time, at a point 50 meters upstream, due to the rapid current, two light pontoon bridges were erected in an attempt to cross the river. Unexpectedly, since the 31st, the enemy army (referring to our army) has been preventing our army from advancing with fierce artillery fire, and this has continued for two days and nights. During one attempt to erect an assault bridge, another 200 people were killed by the enemy. Therefore, Commander Kawanami pointed to the bridge and said to the reporter (Japanese reporter), "This bridge is made of the flesh of countless soldiers." After we crossed the bridge, we saw our comrades collecting the remains of more than a hundred soldiers, and both the river and the hills were stained with blood. Later, inspecting the enemy positions, we saw communication trenches one or two kilometers deep, winding like long snakes. Their construction was particularly astonishing.

### Large Quantities of First-Aid Medicines Will Be Transported to China Through Various Routes

The Japanese Military Authorities Will Not Interfere; Our Rear Area Relief Work is Outstanding

The Continental Daily reports that the Continental Daily representative visited Colonel Walterville, the representative of the International Red Cross Headquarters in Geneva, at the International Hotel yesterday. According to him, large quantities of first-aid medicines will be shipped from the United States, Australia, and Germany to China in the near future. The Japanese military authorities will not interfere. He has reached an agreement with the Japanese authorities here. After inspecting the Red Cross and military hospitals in the rear area, Mr. Hua returned to Shanghai on Thursday and described the conditions of the hospitals in Nanshi, Suzhou, Hankou, and other places, saying that there has been great progress recently. Wounded soldiers are now receiving better treatment than before. Medical treatment and everything else are faster than before. The organization of the hospitals has made the distribution of supplies and medical staff smooth. The biggest difficulty for the Red Cross and military hospitals today is not the lack of funds, but the purchase of supplies and the transportation of supplies to various bases. In the near future, this difficulty will probably become more serious. The Chinese army has now retreated, and it is said that all hospitals in Nanjing will be moved to various places in the interior. The organization of the hospitals may be disrupted as a result. Nanjing has a large building that can accommodate a large number of wounded soldiers. Suzhou is one of the major bases for hospitals, but it is now close to the front line and must also be moved. The hospitals at various ports between Hankou and Wuhu are full of wounded soldiers and cannot increase the number of beds. Although it is possible to set up other bases, it will take time to arrange them. For example, the Red Cross hospital established at Nanjing University can accommodate more than 2,000 wounded soldiers, but it must now be moved. The director of surgery at that hospital, Mr. Edinger, is extremely diligent and admirable. He performs an average of more than 20 surgeries every day, often without rest for four or five days. There is no shortage of miscellaneous staff in the hospitals. What is lacking are experienced surgical doctors. It is said that ten experienced surgical doctors from Vienna and their assistants will arrive in China soon and will be of great help to them when they arrive. There are a large number of volunteers. Although these people are not trained, they are of great help to the wounded soldiers, especially the Boy Scouts, who do not spare their efforts and run around every day except for a few hours of sleep. A large number of medicines are already on the way, and it will not be difficult to transport them to the hospital bases after they are received here. The Chinese Red Cross does not have much medicine in storage, but fortunately, the United Kingdom and the United States have provided timely assistance, and more will be shipped in continuously in the future, so there is no need to worry about shortages. During this inspection, Mr. Hua often admired the wisdom of the Chinese people in improving everything. Although they do not have the convenience of modern science, they can always find ways to cope with emergencies and are quite appropriate. In the beginning of the war, everything was almost unprepared, but the Chinese people rose up in time and were still able to carry out their good work. Mr. Hua is scheduled to depart for Japan on the Shanghai Maru on Saturday to attend the invitation of the Japanese Red Cross to visit the organization. At the same time, he will also conduct final consultations with the Japanese authorities regarding the shipment of medicines to China and their distribution to various places. After Mr. Hua has completed his business in Japan, he will go to Washington to submit a report on the inspection of the Chinese Red Cross organization to the headquarters of the American Red Cross. Mr. Hua has telegraphed Geneva, asking to send another person to replace him as the liaison officer between the organizations here. The Yihang Shipping Company's Ender Wheel, an English merchant ship, left Ningbo for Shanghai at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday and anchored outside Wusong Estuary at 8:00 PM that night. It entered the port and docked at Jinliyuan Wharf at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. The reporter boarded the ship yesterday morning and met with senior crew members and passengers. According to reports, Ningbo was bombed by enemy planes on the 12th of this month. At that time, people were uneasy, and residents in the city fled to the surrounding countryside, resulting in a sharp decline in the business of various shops in the city. The area has been very peaceful in recent days. The rumor that enemy ships bombarded Zhenhai and landed unsuccessfully is not true. Change to Other Routes: After the Ender Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo, it decided to change its route to the Shanghai-Tongzhou line. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai Jinliyuan Wharf for Tongzhou at 8:00 AM on the 19th of this month (Friday). Ticket sales have already begun. The price of the official cabin is 8 yuan per person, the room cabin is 5 yuan per person, half price for children, the third-class cabin is 2.5 yuan per person, and 1.3 yuan for children. The New Beijing Wheel has decided to change its route to the Shanghai-Wenzhou line and is scheduled to depart from the Shanghai Taikoo Wharf for Wenzhou at 11:00 AM on the 20th of this month. Contact information for shipping goods: ㊀ No. 19, Xiang'anli, Dama Road, Yuan Da Fa, ㊁ No. 4, Xinyong'an Street, Yuan Tai Xin, ㊂ Nos. 40, Fa Da Ma, Tong Feng Tai, Te Ping Not Open: After Yihang Shipping Company, an English merchant company, responded to the request of various Ningbo groups in Shanghai and continued to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo line to maintain transportation, it sent an urgent telegram to the Ningbo authorities yesterday morning to request permission for the Te Ping Wheel to continue to operate and scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Ningbo at 3:00 PM, first selling passenger tickets at the company's door on Guangdong Road. At the same time, it stated that if it could not open, the fare would be refunded. The ticket buyers were very crowded, and the police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order. By 5:00 PM, no reply had been received from the Ningbo authorities, so it was decided to suspend the opening to Ningbo. Whether it will open today will depend on the next decision after receiving a reply. Reasons for Suspension: The reporter learned from the shipping industry that the reason for the suspension of the Shanghai-Ningbo line is that the Zhenhai Estuary has been blockaded by our army. Although a small road is left, it can only be guided into the port after permission has been obtained. Now, because enemy ships are cruising outside the estuary, a certain commander in that port telegraphed the Shanghai-Ningbo groups, advising various ships to refrain from sailing to Ningbo to avoid danger. When the Ender Wheel arrived in Ningbo last time, a certain commander notified it that it would not be allowed to sail to Ningbo again in the future, otherwise it would be strictly investigated. Therefore, if ships want to sail to Ningbo in the future, they must first be approved by the authorities in that port, and so on. No War: All the newspapers in the city yesterday reported that more than 20 enemy ships gathered outside Zhenhai Estuary, shelling our side and sending motorboats to try to break through the blockade line. Our artillery also returned fire, and the fighting lasted for ten hours. It was also said that enemy ships fired at Longshan, causing Ningbo people in Shanghai to worry and inquire about the truth from the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. According to Mr. Fang Jiaobo, the director of the association, Ningbo has been peaceful and uneventful in recent days except for being bombed by enemy planes once. As for the news of the artillery battle in Zhenhai Longshan, the association received a telegram from Ningbo stating that there was no such thing. Also, according to passengers who arrived in Shanghai on the Ender Wheel this morning, there were no traces of enemy ships outside Zhenhai Estuary. This news may have been deliberately fabricated by villains to confuse people. In order to avoid misunderstandings among fellow villagers, the association specially published an important announcement to fellow villagers in the newspaper today, which is recorded as follows: Announcement: In recent days, there have been reports in the newspapers about the artillery battle in Zhenhai Longshan. Fellow villagers have come to inquire about the truth. The association receives accurate telegrams every day. There has been no artillery battle in Zhenhai Longshan in recent days. This is specially announced to fellow villagers, please do not worry.

### No War in Zhenhai Longshan; The Rumor of a Shelling Battle is Inaccurate

Panic Arises from Enemy Planes Distributing Leaflets; Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association Publishes in Newspapers to Comfort Fellow Villagers; The Te Ping Wheel Did Not Depart Yesterday

In recent days, the situation in Zhenhai and Ningbo has been unusually tense, and it has been rumored that Japanese ships have shelled outside Zhenhai Estuary, attempting to land marines, resulting in foreign ships suspending operations and the port preparing to be blocked. Yesterday, the Huayi Shipping Company's Ender Ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo, carrying more than 1,000 passengers. In order to understand the truth about Zhenhai and Ningbo, the reporter specially inquired with the crew. According to them, there were no Japanese ships outside Zhenhai Estuary, and there was no shelling. The reason for the panic was that a Japanese plane came to Ningbo last Tuesday and distributed leaflets stating that it would bomb Ningbo within three days. Sure enough, on Friday, multiple bombers came to the railway station and other places to throw bombs, causing the people of Ningbo to feel extremely uneasy and flee to the surrounding countryside. The commander of the Zhenhai Fortress then increased the blockade tools and prohibited foreign ships from entering and leaving. This is a necessary measure for coastal defense, not the shelling of Japanese ships. It was also heard that there were very few Japanese ships along the way from Ningbo to Shanghai. Yesterday, the number of Japanese ships outside Wusong Estuary was also greatly reduced, and most of them had turned into Hangzhou Bay and the Yangtze River. The Huayi Company's Te Ping Wheel was originally scheduled to open to Ningbo yesterday, and tickets had been sold, but the company telegraphed to inquire with the Zhenhai authorities and did not receive a reply until late, so the ship could not depart, and the passengers had all boarded the ship. The Te Ping Wheel is now docked at Jinliyuan Wharf. Whether it will depart depends on the Zhenhai reply today. According to the crew members, since last Friday, the stores in Ningbo and Zhenhai have closed their doors, and nine out of ten residents have moved, making the city unusually desolate, which has never been seen before.

### Patriotism is Not a Crime; Thirty-Six of Our Country's Sailors Refuse to Transport Military Supplies to Japan

The Shipowner Sues for Strike; The Australian Court Orders Release; The Shipowner Funds the Return of All to the Country

Chinese sailors employed on Dutch merchant ships who were unwilling to go to Japan with the ship and voluntarily resigned and returned to the country from the South Seas Islands have already numbered three batches, totaling more than 210 people. These sailors, out of ardent love for their motherland, are unwilling to indirectly promote the enemy's aggression, sacrificing their existing occupation to show their firm patriotic stance. These sailors have been sent back to China in batches by our country's consulates in various parts of the South Seas. Now, there is another foreign ship in Australia, named "Stuardaff", which is currently chartered by Japan to transport a large amount of military materials to Japan from Australia. There are 36 Chinese sailors on board. Knowing that they were transporting military supplies, the sailors were stirred by patriotic emotions and refused to work, causing the ship to be unable to depart in Australia. The shipowner of "Stuardaff" charged our country's sailors with the crime of striking, and sued the Australian court, detaining 36 of our country's patriotic sailors. When our country's consulate in Australia learned of this, it immediately came forward to negotiate, and at the same time asked a lawyer to attend to prove that the behavior of the sailors was purely out of love for their motherland and did not violate the law. As a result of the debate, the Australian court ruled that the actions of the 36 sailors were justified and legal, and ordered their immediate release. The court also ordered the shipowner to bear all travel expenses. These 36 people boarded a British company ship on the 7th of this month to return to the country, and it is said that they will first arrive in Hong Kong and return to Shanghai, and will probably arrive in Shenzhou in two weeks.

### We Resolve to Defend the Crucial Southern Bank of the Yellow River in Shandong to the Death

Han Fuju Goes to the Front Line to Supervise the Battle; Our Counterattack on Daming is Extremely Successful; The Positions in Shanxi Province Have Had Little Change Recently

[Xuzhou] Military News: The battle on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the 15th was extremely fierce, annihilating many enemies. For strategic reasons, we have begun an orderly retreat to the southern bank of the Yellow River since the 16th, and left a large guerrilla force in Hebei to contain the enemy's southward advance. The Luankou Railway Bridge was also destroyed by our army after retreating. The construction of new fortifications on the Henan front has been completed in advance. Han Fuju has ordered the front-line troops to resist to the death, firmly defend the crucial points of the Yellow River, and personally went to the front line to supervise the troops. On the 16th, in the bleak wind and rain, he supervised the battle across the river. Enemy tanks and armored vehicles have difficulty crossing the river to operate. (Central News Agency, 17th)

[Linfen] In Shanxi Province, after our army held the new defense line, strong fortifications have been built in the Fenyang and Fenxi areas. The front-line battle news has been relatively quiet in recent days, and there has been no change in our positions. (Central News Agency, 17th)

Our army will immediately give them a severe blow, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. ㊁Our special operations team has recently been fighting the enemy in the Anyang Zhanghe area and has seized many military supplies. ㊂There are no traces of the enemy north and south of Zhengding. (Central News Agency, 17th)

[Beiping] The southward advance of the Japanese army in Daming has obviously been successful, because a large number of Chinese troops attempted to cut off their rear communication lines a few days ago, so the Japanese army must first clear the rear roads before they can go deeper. According to Japanese official sources, the participants in disrupting the Japanese army's rear communication were four divisions of Chinese infantry, one division of cavalry, and one brigade of infantry, mostly subordinates of the 29th Army. It is heard that the Japanese army has not made any attempts to cross the Yellow River within the Tianjin-Pukou Railway area, but the Japanese authorities have recently confirmed that the Yellow River Railway Bridge has indeed been blown up, and claimed that 37 foreigners in Daming are now safe.

[Nanjing] Government agencies are now continuously moving to Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, and other places. The Chinese government may issue a formal statement on this today. It is expected that the statement will reaffirm the government's determination to resist Japanese aggression in the long term and to defend Nanjing and China. Even though the various departments in the capital feel the need to move away from the capital. Yesterday, officials acknowledged that the civilian agencies of the government have started preparations to move to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It has also been learned from reliable sources that the divisions and sections of several departments have already started working in Changsha. It is said that the above-mentioned agencies had moved to that place a month before the capital was threatened. Wounded soldiers in Nanjing continued to be moved to the interior yesterday. According to health officials, this movement is purely because the wounded soldiers in Suzhou must be transferred to Nanjing for treatment, so the existing wounded soldiers must be moved to the interior to provide more space. The various embassies here feel very uneasy and, when necessary, are prepared to order the people of their respective countries to evacuate. The number of foreigners coming here is increasing day by day, mostly missionaries moving from the war zone and the Suzhou area. (James F.

### The Shanghai Local Court Remains Temporarily in Operation

It Has Not Received Orders to Dissolve; Expenses are Subsidized by the Provincial Government

After the fall of Nanshi, the Shanghai Local Court, which exercised judicial power in the Chinese-controlled areas of Shanghai, was occupied by the enemy at the same time. All staff and judicial police retreated to No. 150 Zhonghui Building in the French Concession. In recent days, judges and lower-level staff have gathered there, but there is nothing to do. Due to livelihood concerns, the staff have requested the president of the court to find a way, but since the court has not received an order from the superior to dissolve, they are still ordered to report for duty every day and are not allowed to leave. Recently, it was heard that the court has received an order from its superiors to temporarily remain in Zhonghui Building to await further instructions, but the expenses will have to be subsidized by the provincial government.

### The Central Areas of the Public Concession Cannot Tolerate Any Interference

The Municipal Council Has a Loyal and Capable Police Force; Entrusted by the Public to Take Administrative Responsibility; A Briton Expresses Fair Opinion

The North China Daily News published a letter from a Briton, R. D. Rees, yesterday, stating that the sentiment expressed in the newspaper's editorial on November 12 (Translator's note: this article was translated and published in this newspaper on the 13th) is very sincere, and I believe the entire foreign community will be willing to respond. Our Chinese friends are in a state of pain in their hearts and souls today, and anyone who thinks about this will know what their pain is like. At this moment, everyone should show their sympathy to their friends, and although it is difficult to express, at least we should have something to comfort them. I dare to suggest that there is one more thing we should do: we should refuse to hear any suggestions that seem to take advantage of the situation to create a new position of special rights and interests for foreigners, even in the sacred name of trade. The Chinese people are our business partners, and while they are paying close attention to maintaining the survival of their country and have no time to consider other matters, we are engaged in new arrangements. This kind of behavior is very much like that of an accomplice, and we do not want to bear this bad reputation. Great Britain can be called a nation of shopkeepers, and we and our American cousins are proud of our respect for honor, sportsmanship, and fairness, and we will defend this reputation with all our might. For the same reason, I dare to hope that my comrades will not docilely acquiesce to any attempts to interfere with the freedom of the central areas of the Public Concession. We may be surrounded, but we are here, not in an area that has been conquered or occupied. The Public Concession is a place of joint operation, and none of those who have joined the partnership have the right to control the interests of the entire partnership. I believe that we have a responsibility to guarantee to the country in which we live that the Shanghai Municipal Council has a loyal and capable police force, and is backed by the relevant powers, and will continue to be entrusted by the public to take administrative responsibility. Acquiescing to any other suggestions will endanger our own reputation and the entire future of this city.

### A Glimpse of the Situation in Hongkou

Foreigners Going to Transport Goods Must Obtain a Pass; Indian Police Direct Traffic at Intersections; Chinese People Cannot Go

According to news from the Shanghai Times, the Hongkou Concession along Yangshupu has somewhat returned to normal in recent days. Trucks transporting goods to and from the area have been coming and going in an endless stream, especially those passing through the Waibaidu Bridge and taking Broadway Road. However, Dithmarschen Road, Boone Road, North Sichuan Road, and Scott Road are still under the enemy's control under the pretext of being in a special military state. Except for their own nationals who can return to their old residences, foreigners of other countries are still prohibited from entering. Chinese people are absolutely not allowed to go. Foreigners of all countries who go to their old residences in Yangshupu or transport goods must also obtain a pass from their consulate, and sometimes even obtain a pass from the enemy's military authorities, before they can pass through the Waibaidu Bridge and go north. Therefore, it will still take some time before Hongkou is completely unobstructed. However, one phenomenon that was not present in the past is that Indian police are now directing traffic at the intersections in Hongkou. Because the area is still in a special situation, the traffic rules are also slightly different from those south of the Suzhou Creek. Many roads that were blocked by the war still cannot be directly used by vehicles. However, efforts are being made to reduce such areas. The enemy police are still entrenched in the area north of Old Baizi Road. As for the persons in charge of the concession's public utilities, they are working hard to restore operations. Once the time is ripe, this goal can be achieved. The telephone company continued to provide services during the war in Shanghai and is now planning to continue its recovery plan. The persons in charge of the gas company and the electricity company are also investigating the damage in various parts of the area in order to repair it. Other transportation agencies are also planning to restore the pre-war situation. The trolleybuses south of the Suzhou Creek to West Hongkou resumed service on Monday of this week, passing through Henan Road Bridge to Old Baizi Road. The trams had also crossed the Old Garbage Bridge to the First Special District Court long ago. The routes of other trams and buses are also being planned for restoration.

### The Nanshi Refugee Area is Still Under the Charge of the Relief Association

The Current Status Has Not Changed; Stranded Refugees Were Settled Yesterday; The National Government Donated 50,000 Yuan in Relief Funds

According to news from the International Relief Committee, yesterday, in view of the torrential rain and the pitiful sight of the refugees sitting and lying hungry on the streets and along the Minguo Road without a home to go to, the committee specially sent Commissioner Jiang Zhiqing and six staff members to try to lead them into the newly opened Danhua Wanzhu School and other shelters for accommodation. The order there is now good, but at present, the night dew is cold, and the refugees lack clothing to keep warm. Many of those who are suffering from the cold and abdominal pain are groaning in the shelter, and the situation is very miserable. The mortality rate has increased in recent days compared with the past. It is hoped that all sectors of society will donate a large number of medicines and other items to the committee to help the suffering people, and the merit will be immeasurable. In addition, the temporary hospital established by the committee in the area was established yesterday in the City God Temple and is being staffed by the Chinese Red Cross for diagnosis and treatment. The Pushan Villa is responsible for burying the corpses.

The North China Daily News reports that the "Father Jacquinot Zone" in Nanshi has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees. It was learned yesterday that the preparations for happiness in the area are now proceeding in a very satisfactory manner. The parties concerned have also discussed the status of the area and decided that the area will still be managed by the committee. The committee, purely for humanitarian reasons, will be responsible for the happiness of the "citizens" of the area. The Japanese army has abided by the agreement and has not entered the area managed by the committee. In order to maintain law and order, the committee has recruited residents of the area to form a small team, supervised by a specially recruited small group of Russians, to patrol together. Among the residents of the area, 100,000 can be said to be destitute. Vacant houses are being found to house them. Sanitation work is now in its initial stages and is being undertaken by organized teams. Medical work is now underway and preparations are being made to establish a general hospital in the area. The water supply is still limited, but in addition to relying on the wells in the area, the French Concession authorities and the French Water Company also supply some to meet the emergency needs. The food supply is considered adequate, mostly steamed buns, supplied continuously by various groups and individuals, and distributed at the center designated by the committee. The committee hopes that someone will supply health food, such as soybeans and vegetables. The committee would like to ask the general sponsors to pay attention to the distribution of all food items from the headquarters to avoid abuse. This is absolutely necessary. The committee's current position is that the food supply seems to be too abundant, but storage is very difficult. In this situation, we would like to ask all friends to inquire with members of the committee or the French Concession police station on Gongguan Road about everything before continuing to supply. When the current storage of goods is about to be used up, the committee will announce to the public in the newspapers. Now that the cold winter is approaching, cotton clothes and quilts will be urgently needed. The committee has begun to address this issue. Because many of the messages circulating outside about the situation in the area are untrue, the committee asks friends to use the responsible information issued by the committee as the standard.

The Continental Times reports that last night, Father Jacquinot announced that the National Government had donated 50,000 yuan through Song Ziwen to cover the expenses of the relief work in the Nanshi refugee area.

The Relief Association Holds a Standing Committee Meeting

The Shanghai International Relief Association held its sixth standing committee meeting yesterday. In addition to reporting on the progress of various relief efforts since the establishment of the Nanshi refugee area, the meeting also carefully discussed and stipulated handling methods for matters such as the raising of huge sums for the refugees in the area, as well as hygiene, fire protection, and management. At the same time, the meeting adopted the insurance industry's proposal for a "one jiao per day" campaign, believing that it was universal and easy to implement and could achieve great results, and decided to promote it immediately.

The Temporary Hospital Was Established Yesterday

As a result of the continued dispatch of personnel by the International Relief Association yesterday in the rain to persuade the refugees, the majority of the refugees sitting and lying along the Minguo Road have been given shelter, so the road is now clear. In addition, the association established a temporary hospital in the City God Temple yesterday for the diagnosis and treatment of sick refugees, and the Chinese Red Cross sent personnel to be responsible for the diagnosis and treatment. Yesterday, seven male and female corpses and six children's corpses in the area were handed over to Pushan Villa for burial. Due to the rain yesterday, the cleaning campaign was not fully implemented, and only the City God Temple and Wanzhu School were cleaned.

Bitter Cold Rain, Lack of Clothing and Bedding

The weather is cold and the refugees are alone, all without cold-weather items, which has caused many to suffer from abdominal pain and cold sores after being frozen. The groaning situation is very miserable. Therefore, the mortality rate has increased in recent days compared with the past. It is hoped that all sectors of society will be compassionate and donate cold-weather clothing, bedding, and medicines to the Overseas Chinese Youth Association on the third floor of Eight Immortals or to the association's third shelter on Luzon Road, Edward Road.

It is also reported that after the International Relief Committee and various charitable organizations have been actively rescuing the Nanshi refugees for days, food has gradually been distributed, but it will still be extremely difficult in the future. It is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will continue to provide assistance. The reporter inspected the Minguo Road area again yesterday morning and saw many refugees still wandering aimlessly on the streets. At that time, it was not yet dawn, and they had broken coats wrapped around their heads, or were only wearing single clothes, and the situation was very miserable. The reporter tried to meet them by the iron gate and learned that most of them had fled from the four villages, as far as Songjiang and Fengxian counties. Because they fled in a hurry, they did not have time to carry boxes or baskets, or even if they brought some clothes, they abandoned them halfway when they encountered enemy planes strafing. Therefore, they were all poorly clothed and unable to withstand the north wind and dew, especially women and children. It is urgently hoped that all sectors of society will actively donate clothing and bedding so that they can survive under the broken walls and ruins.

Investigating the Exact Number of Refugees in the Area

The association is now conducting an investigation to clarify the exact number of refugees living in the area. In addition to the nearly 100,000 who have been reported in the newspapers in recent days, the association has found 140 people in the Liyuan Guild Hall, 300 people in the Sugar Industry Guild Hall, 450 people in the Old Cathedral, 600 people in the Second District Police Station, 130 people in Shangyue Building, 40 people at No. 73 Baiyi Street, 70 people at No. 35 Zhangchuan Road, 40 people in Sun Yuxing Fan Shop, 150 people at No. 21 and 30 Yanhai Road, 600 people in Shenxiang Pavilion, 120 people at No. 62 and 64 Luxiangyuan Road, 100 people in Xuan Yuan Temple, and about 3,000 people in various alleys in Jiu Mu Di.

Cleaning Campaign Held Locally

Father Jacquinot, the initiator of the Nanshi refugee area, in view of the fact that many refugees in the area are sick, and there is dirt everywhere, and there are a large number of people, if it is not quickly cleaned up, it will have a great impact on the health of the refugees, specially notified the International Relief Committee to find a way to clean it up as soon as possible. The committee will cooperate with charitable organizations such as the Fire Brigade, the Chinese and Foreign Volunteer Fire Brigade, the Chinese Child Welfare Association, the Chinese Jishi Association, the Red Cross, and the Catholic Action Association to implement a large-scale cleaning campaign today. Each will send personnel with a large number of cleaning tools, led by the International Relief Committee, into the refugee area, divide the area, supervise the workers and refugees to start cleaning, only because of the rain, the work is difficult, so the areas such as Yimiao will be cleaned first.

Pawnshops Establish Shelters in the Urban Area

The Pawnshop Guild of this city, in view of the Nanshi refugees, who are in deep water and heat, and whose number is still quite large, in addition to being displaced and killed, have not had a full meal for several days. There are still those who gather in the Minguo Road area, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, and the situation is very pitiful. Although the people and groups in the concession have provided assistance, it is not enough. The guild has specially established a shelter at No. 39 Wu Jiaheng, Nanshi refugee area, to benefit the victims, and donated 1,416.66 yuan in national currency to the International Relief Committee for relief.

### The Story of the Capture of Sijing

Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Convene Yesterday to Discuss Relief for Refugees

Sijing is an important town in the northeast of Songjiang, about 40 miles from Shanghai. The market town has always been prosperous. According to those who fled to Shanghai from the town, after the town fell on the 11th of this month, it was set on fire. Most of the shops and houses in Nanshi were reduced to ashes. At that time, our army put up a strong resistance, and bullets were flying everywhere, so many residents of the town were killed and injured. After the incident, no less than 2,000 people from the town fled to Shanghai, but a part of them were blocked in the Caohejing and Xujiahui areas. It is not known where they are now, and news has been cut off, and their life and death are unknown. In addition, the people of Sijing in Shanghai, pitying their fellow townsmen who fled to Shanghai, were displaced and distressed, so they convened yesterday to discuss relief methods. It was decided that: (1) actively register the fellow townsmen in distress; (2) write to various relief associations and charitable organizations to accommodate the fellow townsmen in distress; (3) solicit donations from fellow townsmen to provide for relief needs; (4) set up a fellow townsmen's communication office in the Changshun sign in the Songjiang Alley behind the Zhongnan Hotel on Edward Road.

### Record of Refugees' Tears

— Ji Ping

The Human Hell is Unbearable to Witness; Doing Everything Possible to Help is Immensely Meritorious

Shanghai has been scarred and unbearable to witness since the war. At present, the most urgent issues are the four major problems of order, food, sanitation, and medical care for refugees. The refugees in the first and second special zones will not be mentioned for the time being. There are more than 200,000 in the Nanshi refugee area alone, who are crying out for food. In the past five or six days, I have heard about the tragic situation in the refugee area every day, but hearing is not as good as seeing, and one cannot know the details without experiencing it personally. Yesterday (the 15th) afternoon, I happened to meet Mr. Fang Chunqian of the Mujiantang Relief Team, who was willing to be my guide and pinned a Red Cross badge on his left arm. We entered the refugee area from the Nanyang Bridge and inspected various places for three hours, collecting a lot of material. What is published here is only one-tenth or two-tenths of it.

According to a 72-year-old woman: "We arrived here on the 8th, and did not eat a grain of food for two days. On the third day, we received two Guangbing, which we could not swallow. We old people and children hope to eat some thin porridge because our digestion is weak. Several children caught a cold and had abdominal pain after eating hard biscuits and died the next day. There were no coffins, and no one buried them. Their father had to wrap them in old newspapers and put them in a broken house."

A woman who had just given birth and fled from Pudong was holding a four-day-old baby. Because she had not eaten for many days, her milk had dried up, so she fed the baby with finely ground Guangbing crumbs. After two days, the baby died. The woman was sallow and emaciated, without any color. Mr. Fang allowed her to be sent a bowl of soy milk every day, so that her life could be saved. In the refugee area, many mothers get food and give it to their children first, preferring to starve themselves. At this time, the greatness of maternal love is even more evident!

200,000 people are crowded together. It is not just that food is difficult to obtain, but even the problem of defecation is difficult to solve. Cesspool cleaners have not come for a long time, and the streets are full of urine and feces, and the stench is soaring. Twice we hired a chartered car to take us quickly through. One of the drivers refused the fare and said, "What is the use of money! You can't buy food here, and you can't go to the concession. I only ask that you give me enough to eat. I am willing to pull the car all day."

Tens of thousands of refugees on Minguo Road are considered to be the more powerful among the victims. They can grab the food thrown outside the boundary. In addition, the weak refugees can only sit and wait for death. Receiving some big cakes is already a great blessing. I personally saw many children fighting for food in the barbed wire fence, pulling it out with their hands, so that the skin was broken and bleeding, and the food was dyed red, but they still quickly sent it into their mouths.

All the stalls, alleys, streets, churches, offices, schools, and air-raid shelters in the city are crowded with refugees, leaving only private residences and shops with strict gates, and even if someone is watching inside, they dare not open the door. I chatted with many refugees and asked them what they wanted to do. They all said in unison: "I want to go back to my hometown and resume my old business. At the very least, I want to become a beggar or do any labor. Staying here is simply a dead end!"

The release pond under the Nine-Bend Bridge in the City God Temple is extremely dirty, and the water is vegetable-green. Normally, when walking here, everyone would cover their noses and pass by, but this time, because the city's tap water was cut off, the refugees used it as their only drinking water. Some used spittoons to fetch water, and some used the oil pan of a kerosene stove to fetch water to quench their thirst. The ancients said: "People cannot live without water and fire." When they are starving and thirsty, who cares whether it is clean or not? (It is said that tap water has now been connected)

A woman's old illness relapsed and she was in so much pain that she wanted to die. Her husband and young son were crying beside her. The people outside the iron gate were blocked by Annamite police and could not help! Later, a Western woman bought a package of medicine and gave it to her to take, and the sick woman kowtowed to thank her.

The saddest thing is that the children are outside the boundary and the parents are inside, or the children are inside and the parents are outside; their news is cut off from each other, and there is really the suffering of "calling to heaven and it does not respond, calling to earth and it does not answer." When we withdrew from the refugee area and walked to Xinbeimen, we saw an old man with gray hair, an old woman, and a woman, wailing loudly. I took the old man's hand and comforted him. According to the old man, "My son is 19 years old. He entered the refugee area on the 11th to look for someone, but he disappeared because the iron gate of the concession was tightly closed. We have no way. This morning, we bought five yuan worth of Guangbing and threw it at the iron gates in Xinbeimen, Laobeimen, and Xinqiaojie in three places, hoping that my son would come and pick it up. Who knew that the cake was thrown away and we didn't see him. We don't know if he is dead or alive. We are very distressed!" The listeners also shed tears!

The various tragic situations in the refugee area are difficult to describe in words. It is hoped that the various charitable organizations, enthusiastic people from all walks of life, and Father Jacquinot, who first initiated the effort, will properly find a way to address the four major problems of order, food, sanitation, and medical care. I hear that they are gradually getting on the right track. If the above-mentioned tragic situation is gradually resolved, then it will truly be an act of immense merit.

### American Newspapers Comment on the Weakness of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Declaration

Say It's Not as Good as Previous League of Nations Resolutions; Japanese Government to Issue Another Statement

[New York] Regarding the declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the New York Evening Post (leaning Republican) published a commentary stating, "What the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has achieved is an extremely vague accusation against Japan, and its power is highly questionable." The newspaper also criticized the participation of non-treaty signatory countries in the conference. The New York Times (leaning Democratic) stated, "The initial effect of the conference can be said to be extremely small. Compared to the League of Nations and the United States' strong declarations against Japan's invasion of Manchuria several years ago, and considering the current rampant and widespread Japanese aggression in China, the resolution of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can be said to be half-hearted." (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

[New York] The preliminary results obtained by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have recently been commented on by various newspapers. The New York Times reported that after two weeks of discussion, a declaration was finally issued, criticizing Japan's illegal actions in China with mild language, but failing to reach a unanimous agreement. Even if we wanted to say that it morally condemns the aggressor, we cannot. As such, the results already obtained by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can be said to be minimal. Ever since the conference opened, the major powers, especially the United Kingdom and the United States, have failed to establish a firm understanding, which inherently weakened it. Subsequently, all parties were hesitant and failed to express themselves clearly, further highlighting its shortcomings. Looking ahead, what optimism can be expected from the second phase of the conference? The Journal of Commerce reported that there are only two ways to maintain peace through international cooperation: one is to economically sanction Japan, and the other is to materially aid China. However, regarding the first point, the United States is the largest consumer of Japanese silk. Therefore, if sanctions are to be implemented, the United States must take the lead and accept a huge burden, which is clear. Regarding the second point, the scope of the war may expand and affect other countries. The United States government should have a full understanding of this and take appropriate actions. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)

[Moscow] The Moscow News selected an article commenting on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that the conference has now reached a very serious stage. The countries participating in the conference must decide whether to allow Japan to continue its aggression and suffer the consequences, or to find a way to stop this aggression. Japan's refusal to participate in the conference was not unexpected, nor did it fundamentally change the situation when the conference was first convened. Japan's position is very clear: it hopes to obtain complete freedom of action to carry out its grand aggression plan, which is not only aimed at China. Japan's attitude towards the future fate of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is also clear. Japan's aggressive actions have torn up the Washington Treaty and violated all its provisions. This is an unquestionable fact. Therefore, the future fate of the treaty must depend on the attitude of the other signatory countries. If they use force to uphold the provisions of the treaty and make it effective, then the treaty can exist and be an important tool for safeguarding peace. On the contrary, if the participating countries continue to adopt a passive attitude, then the Japanese imperialists' plan will be realized, the treaty will come to an end, and Japan will gain greater freedom of action. The newspaper continued, stating that Japan must stop the conflict only on the condition of completely dominating China and expelling other countries from the Far East. Therefore, we can see that Japan's aggression against China has placed all international obligations aside, completely disregarding other countries and aiming to monopolize the entire China. Japanese imperialism further attempts to gain military and economic control of the Asian coast in the Pacific Ocean. Under such conditions, the main task of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is that all peace-loving countries and countries whose interests have been violated by Japan must clearly decide their attitude. All those who uphold peace hope that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference must refute Japan's claim that its aggressive actions are unrelated to others and that other governments have no right to interfere in Far Eastern affairs. Japan and its allies have declared that any activities by various countries regarding the Far Eastern issue will sharpen the war crisis, which is absurd. It is Japan that is launching a cruel war, and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can stop this war. The declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on November 15 was the first warning to Japan. We hope that the representatives of the participating countries will continue to adhere to the spirit of the declaration and formulate methods and means to stop Japan's aggression against the Chinese people and ensure China's independence and territorial integrity. (16th, TASS)

[Tokyo] The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a plenary session on the 15th and passed a declaration condemning Japan. The Japanese government will issue a statement after the official telegram arrives, clarifying Japan's attitude (17th, Domei).

Brussels. The Japanese spokesman declared at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today that since the parliament adopted a declaration on Monday condemning Japan's violation of the treaty, the door to negotiations between Japan and other countries has been blocked. He also asked whether the countries that voted in favor of this declaration on Monday have solemnly fulfilled their war debts to the United States. It is ridiculous that countries cannot abide by their own promises and want to force others to abide by their commitments. What is most regrettable is that when Japan responded to the conference's final application, there was still room for negotiation, but the countries did not take advantage of it and adopted this declaration, thus blocking the door. (16th, Kuo Min News Agency)

Brussels. The chairman of the League of Nations Union International Federation today sent a letter to the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Mr. Spaak, stating that since Japan has resolutely rejected any mediation, the conference should proceed to the second part of its mission, which is to provide effective material assistance to China—the victim of Japanese aggression—in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant. (16th, Haitong)

### The Emperor Approves the Establishment of the General Headquarters

Aims to Control Military Power; No Relation to Politics

[Tokyo] The Emperor issued an edict today approving the establishment of the General Headquarters. The official explanation stated that this move aims to control military power and is currently unrelated to a declaration of war against China. The Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Japan is unlikely to declare war on China, and the establishment of the General Headquarters will not affect the Foreign Ministry's authority. (17th, Kuo Min News Agency)

[Tokyo] The Emperor today approved the new military ordinance and established the General Headquarters as the highest military authority. The chiefs of staff of the army and navy have also been ordered to engage in adjusting and cooperating with the army and navy strategies, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of Japan's military actions against China. It is reported that this military order will be announced tomorrow. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] The government held a cabinet meeting yesterday and approved the establishment of the General Headquarters. Minister of the Army Sugiyama and Minister of the Navy Yonai gave speeches today because the government procedures have been completed, stating that the war situation in both North China and the Jiangnan area has made considerable progress. However, since the Chinese government has not ceased resistance, the Japanese army and navy authorities have decided to establish the General Headquarters and take a formal wartime stance to thoroughly punish the central hub of the Chinese government. (17th, Domei)

[Tokyo] The General Headquarters, which will be realized soon, is established based on pure command authority and has no political meaning. Therefore, the relationship between it and the cabinet is mediated by the Prime Minister and the Ministers of the Army and Navy in order to achieve smooth operation. That is, regarding matters related to command and administration, officials from the command headquarters and ministers from the administrative departments will conduct consultations under the introduction of the Ministers of the Army and Navy. When holding the Imperial Conference, only Prime Minister Konoe will attend. That is, the Ministers of the Army and Navy will lead their officials to participate in the deliberations of the General Headquarters. The Prime Minister will attend the Imperial Conference of the General Headquarters by special order. These two parties will first discuss matters related to command and government. Based on this, the government will hold a cabinet meeting to decide on various matters related to command authority and handle them quickly. (17th, Domei)

[Tokyo] The declaration passed by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on Monday has aroused fierce backlash from Japanese newspapers. The newspapers are deeply dissatisfied because the Nine-Power Treaty Conference completely ignored Japan's insistence that the Sino-Japanese issue must be resolved directly by the two countries. They are also quite indignant because the phrase "joint action against Japan" in the declaration contains a threatening meaning. The newspapers are now demanding a policy of non-interference in China and declaring the Nine-Power Treaty invalid. The Kokumin Shimbun stated that the Nine-Power Treaty is completely detached from reality and has become a mere formality. Japan should propose to greatly revise or abolish this treaty. The Asahi Shimbun stated that China dreams of interference from a third party, and foreign countries are now taking advantage of this trend. Japan has no other choice but to advance towards Nanjing. Japan is prepared to deal with any situation, which China and a certain cunning country that instigates China should know. The Hochi Shimbun also had the same argument, stating that the most important way to solve this problem is to ask the United Kingdom to adopt a policy of non-interference in China, because China believes that the United Kingdom is its only hope. Japan must at least make the relevant countries understand that Japan will not give up its actions in China until the fundamental principles of its policy have been realized.

### Japan's Trade with Malaya Decreases by 100,000 Pounds in January

British Trade with Japan Unaffected

Singapore. After the informal boycott of Japanese goods by overseas Chinese here, Japan's export trade to Malaya decreased by 100,000 pounds in January. The quantity of tin and rubber shipped to Japan has not seen a significant increase, but the total value of goods shipped to that country has not changed much. Due to the boycott of Japanese goods, the import of British goods to Malaya has greatly increased, especially cotton textiles. (Central News Agency, October 30, Reuters)

[London] Conservative Party member Mr. Ploo-chi inquired about British trade with Japan in the House of Commons today. Secretary of Commerce Stanley replied that British trade with Japan has not decreased significantly since the British people have a tendency not to buy Japanese imported goods. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Claims No Intention to Invade Shanghai Concessions

Matsui's Remarks Were Misunderstood; Requests France to Prohibit Military Supplies from Passing Through Vietnam

[Tokyo] The Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters today that the remarks made by Matsui, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in Shanghai, on November 11 were misinterpreted by foreign reporters. The spokesman continued that he could not say where the mistake was, but he knew that Matsui had never expressed any intention of occupying the public concession south of the Suzhou River. The spokesman firmly denied that Japan had any intention of occupying the public concession. When reporters asked about the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the spokesman was unwilling to express an opinion before obtaining official information. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

[London] According to reliable sources in diplomatic circles here today, Japan recently presented France with a note similar to the Ultimatum because Annam often supplies China with the transport of military supplies, demanding that France quickly stop foreign military supplies from entering China through Annam, otherwise Japan will occupy Hainan Island and bomb the railway from Annam to China. It is said that since France received this note from Japan, although it has continued to send four cruisers to the Far East, due to the tense situation in the Mediterranean and the fact that Annam Tokyo would be indefensible after Hainan Island is occupied by Japan, it has to accept Japan's request temporarily. It is reported that there are still some military supplies in Annam waiting to be transported to China, but the transit of military supplies will definitely be prohibited in the future. (16th, Kuo Min News Agency)

[Tokyo] Regarding the rumors that Japan presented the French government with an ultimatum, requesting it to immediately stop transporting military supplies from Vietnam to aid China, well-informed sources here claimed that Japan protested to the French government on October 13, requesting it to stop transporting military supplies from Vietnam to aid China. At that time, the French government promised to stop after the existing contract was fulfilled. The note presented by Japan this time insists on asking it to stop immediately. This time, the Japanese military authorities notified French diplomats that if they do not stop immediately, they will bomb the railway and the Japanese navy will control Tokyo Bay. (17th, Haitong)

### Italy Does Not Forget Mediating the Sino-Japanese Dispute

But Believes the Time Is Not Ripe

[Rome] Regarding the idea of Germany and Italy mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute, political figures here recently officially stated that although this move is premature, it is one of the goals of Italy's diplomatic policy. Political figures also believe that Japan will not accept the Nine-Power Treaty Conference or the United States if they take on the role of mediation, but Germany and Italy can succeed if they intervene at the appropriate time. This is because Italy-Japan relations have greatly improved after Italy joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, and Italy's relations with China are also very friendly. In addition, well-informed sources claim that the Chinese representative came to Rome to hold talks with important Italian political figures, which has nothing to do with Germany and Italy mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute. Special Envoy Chen Gongbo of China is a close friend of Foreign Minister Count Ciano, so he came to Rome for a visit. Or Chinese figures here believe that Italy's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact will not change Italy's friendship with China, because from Italy's point of view, the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Italy, Germany, and Japan on the 6th of this month is only related to Europe. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)

[Rome] Former Chinese Minister of Industry and Special Envoy to Europe Chen Gongbo will continue to consult today after holding preliminary talks with Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday, and will pay a visit to Mussolini on the 18th. Authoritative sources claim that Chen and Ciano are exchanging views and are not discussing specific political issues. (16th, Haitong)

Barcelona. The delegates to the Third Congress of the Catalan Workers' Union, representing 560,000 workers, decided today to write to the people, adding that the Catalan workers respectfully salute the Chinese compatriots, who are struggling to resist the aggression of fascism just like us, liberate their people, and free themselves from the oppression of the capitalist world.

### Ten Patrol Ships of the Jianghai Customs Were Looted; Two Grain Transport Ships Were Not Occupied

Because Customs Relies on Island Lighthouses to Supply Food; Customs Authorities Are Planning a Response

After the patrol ships and anti-smuggling ships of the Jianghai Customs were looted by the enemy, the Customs authorities are now planning a response. However, there are many errors in the ship names listed by outsiders. The correspondent of the Datong News Agency has inquired with the Jianghai Customs about the truth as follows:

Investigation of Occupied Ships

The patrol ships of the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai that were looted by the enemy include the Fuxing, Lianxing, Huaxing, Yunxing, and Wenxing, as well as one anti-smuggling ship, named Haiyan, three motorboats, named Fuwei, Yongning, and Huguang, and one small steamboat, named Jiaoji, totaling ten ships of various sizes. As for the Liuxing and Haiguang, because they are grain transport ships that supply food to the lighthouse keepers on isolated islands, the enemy did not dare to loot them.

Customs Response

The ten patrol ships, anti-smuggling ships, etc. that were looted are now being held near Yangshupu and have not sailed out of the Songhu area. The Chinese and foreign tax police and anti-smuggling personnel on these ten ships total no less than 600 people. Because they were all forced to leave the ships, they are now awaiting news from the Patrol Engineering Department, because the Customs authorities are planning a response.

Commentary

### Germany and Us

— Feng Lieshan

When the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact was signed last year, all those who considered themselves friends of Germany felt it was a very regrettable thing. For Germany's own sake, based on the experience of cooperating with Japan before the European War, there seemed to be no need to repeat the same mistake. As far as the friendship between China and Germany is concerned, it only made us more disappointed. This is a fact. For many years, the Chinese people have always had a good impression of Germany, especially after the European War. We opposed the Treaty of Versailles with a feeling of being oppressed and spoke out for the German people. The fact that German expatriates in China were welcomed everywhere by the Chinese people shows our goodwill. In recent years, trade between the two countries has also increased step by step. We were all hoping that the friendship between the two countries would become even closer. Unfortunately, at this time, Germany suddenly adopted a new policy and stood on the side of our enemy.

Of course, the original intention of the German National Socialist Party authorities when signing the treaty, just like their repeated statements, was not to deal with China. We understand this point. However, Germany is too far away from the Far East, and the complexity of Sino-Japanese relations cannot be understood by these new politicians. In the past, what we were worried about was that the Japanese would not use this agreement to deal with Soviet Russia, but would settle accounts with us Chinese first. Sure enough, our predictions have now become a reality.

Although Germany regards Japan as a comrade in anti-communism, there is a huge difference between the two in the definition of communism. We hope that at least Dr. Goebbels, the German Minister of Propaganda, will understand this point. According to the Japanese military, not only those who oppose Japan are communists, but also those who do not agree with Japanese policies, and even those who do not follow the orders of the military are communists. This is why there are so many communists in the Far East. Is the kind of communism that Germany wants to oppose also this kind?

Precisely because we are friends of Germany, we especially regret this new German policy. Not only has Japan currently used this agreement as an excuse to invade China, but more importantly, in recent years, the tone of German newspapers on Far Eastern events has been far less fair than before. Since the establishment of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, we have always had this premonition when reading German newspapers that Germany would gradually forget our friendship. For example, the editorials of the Frankfurter Zeitung used to be so brilliant, but regarding the current Sino-Japanese war, they only say some irrelevant things. And the National Socialist Party's official newspapers, especially the Angriff, are not only defending the Japanese, but also intentionally or unintentionally making fun of us. These reporters have forgotten, when they praise Japan's actions as being for the sake of human culture, where does that leave China? What is especially unpleasant for us is the tone in the Pester Lloyd. If the reporter had not used a German name, we would have mistaken it for a Japanese person!

What seems most disappointing is the large-scale adoption of Domei News Agency's dispatches by German newspapers. This kind of one-sided propaganda does not give us a chance to defend ourselves. Although most German people sympathize with China, this is not enough to reassure us. Germany knows very well how effective the news policies of the United Kingdom and France were during the European War, and what's more, this is not consistent with the spirit of neutrality repeatedly expressed by the German government. Secondly, the attitude of local German newspapers is obviously mostly pro-Japanese, and the remarks are far less subtle than those of the major newspapers, which naturally makes it easier to damage the feelings between the Chinese and German peoples.

We acknowledge that Germany is our friend, but there is always a difference between the words of a friend and the words of an enemy. When this point is not achieved, then it is not enough to be a friend.

### Belgian King Receives Grand Welcome in London

British Privy Councillor Arrives in Berlin; Meets with German Authorities on the Same Day

[London] The identity of thought and interests between the United Kingdom and Belgium and the long-standing friendship between the two countries have not been affected by the collapse of the Locarno Treaty, as can be proved by the warm welcome received by King Leopold of Belgium in London. At the moment, London is flying both British and Belgian flags on all important buildings due to the King's arrival. The newspapers have unanimously published prominently what the King said at the banquet last night that the United Kingdom is the "protector of peace". When King George VI toasted King Leopold's health, he said that the United Kingdom and Belgium have a common determination to increase sincerity and justice in international relations, which is the most valuable guarantee for future world peace. In his reply, the King emphasized the interrelationship of all economic causes and political difficulties, and said that the British Empire has a benevolent task in economic guidance. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

[London] King Leopold III of Belgium arrived in Dover, England by ship from his country at 12:50 noon today. He immediately took a special train and arrived at Victoria Station here at 3:15 pm. King George VI of the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Chamberlain both personally went to the station to welcome him. Foreign Secretary Eden was unable to go due to illness. In addition, many people cheered and paid tribute to the King. After the King left the station, he drove to Buckingham Palace with a cavalry patrol leading the way, and arrived at Buckingham Palace at 3:30 pm. After a short rest, he visited Queen Mother Mary of the United Kingdom. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)

[Berlin] The schedule for the visit of British Privy Councillor Lord Halifax to Germany has been fully determined. Tomorrow morning, he will visit Foreign Minister Neurath, Aviation Minister Goering, and Defense Minister Blomberg separately. In the afternoon, he will visit the International Hunting Exhibition and go to Munich in the evening. On the morning of the 19th, he will transfer from Munich to Berchtesgaden to visit Führer Hitler. Afterwards, he will return to Berlin on the evening of the 19th. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)

### The Soviet Union's Stance on the Spanish Problem

Accepting a Compromise

[London] During yesterday's meeting of the subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War, Soviet representative Maisky stated that after the "substantial withdrawal" of foreign volunteers from Spain, he would accept a measure granting the warring parties of the Spanish Civil War certain rights as belligerent groups. This move greatly benefits the finalization of an agreement, and representatives from various countries have taken it seriously. One of the main obstacles has now been overcome. Some other important issues that have not yet been resolved will be discussed by a committee of experts, and they will intensify their work so that progress can be made before the subcommittee resumes its meeting early next week. As for the previous notes submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee by the warring parties of the Spanish Civil War (regarding the dispatch of an international investigation team to Spain to study the withdrawal of volunteers), it is expected that replies will be submitted by the day of the subcommittee's next meeting. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas dispatch)

[London] The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War continued its meeting this afternoon. Soviet representative Maisky immediately stated that he accepted the resolution passed by the subcommittee on the 4th of this month, which was based on the British proposal. This resolution stipulates that recognition of the warring parties of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups would only occur after the "substantial withdrawal" of foreign volunteers. Soviet representative Maisky first stated that, according to his government, the issue of recognizing belligerent groups is completely unrelated to the issue of withdrawing volunteers. However, for the convenience of the committee's work, they have repeatedly shown concessions. "Now, in order to facilitate the actual work of withdrawing volunteers, they have decided to accept the resolution passed by the subcommittee on the 4th of this month in its entirety without reservation. Regarding the so-called 'substantial withdrawal' in this resolution, how it should be interpreted, we are prepared to adopt the same attitude as other governments. In other words, we will wait for the subcommittee to submit it for discussion before making further plans." The chairman of the subcommittee, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, then spoke, saying that the subcommittee's discussions on the two aspects of withdrawing volunteers and recognizing belligerent groups had already yielded considerable results. The subcommittee then decided to postpone the meeting until the beginning of next week. However, if the replies that the warring parties of the Spanish Civil War should submit regarding the Non-Intervention Committee's dispatch of an international investigation team to Spain to study the withdrawal of volunteers can be delivered earlier, then it is possible to advance the meeting. However, observers still believe that the "substantial withdrawal" aspect will inevitably cause some difficulties when it is submitted for discussion in the future, because it is necessary to determine what number can be considered "substantial" before the issue of recognizing belligerent groups can be discussed.

### South China Rice Company Purchases and Transports Large Quantities of Rice

The Limited Price Per Market Stone Still Remains Fourteen Yuan. All Profits Will Be Allocated to Relief for Refugees

Recently, there has been talk in Shanghai that the rice supply is running out. Yesterday, a reporter paid a special visit to the person in charge of the South China Rice Company. According to them, the recent surge in the city's population and the many obstructions to transportation in the war zone have made it difficult to transport rice from the interior, and residents are understandably worried. In fact, the Shanghai rice merchant community and local authorities have made considerable preparations to regulate the food supply and limit prices, and the situation is not as dire as rumored. It is only because a small number of unscrupulous individuals are causing trouble with excuses, and profiteers are taking the opportunity to raise prices and hoard goods, that false rumors have spread. In order to serve society and stabilize people's minds, our company has purchased large quantities of rice from various places and is trying to transport it to Shanghai as quickly as possible. We have also agreed with the Rice Industry Association on fair distribution and price controls. The company's cost is about ten yuan and seven jiao per market stone, and the wholesale price is twelve yuan and nine jiao per market stone. Including freight and miscellaneous expenses, the limited retail price at rice stores is fourteen yuan per market stone. As for the company's profits, all of them will be allocated to a special fund for refugee relief in various districts of Shanghai. From now on, there is no need to worry about the lack of food in Shanghai, and lowering the price of rice and preventing it from rising on the black market will also benefit the lives of ordinary people.

### More Than 80,000 Refugees Still in the International Settlement

Traffic Obstructions Make Relocation More Difficult. There Is a Great Need for Winter Clothing and Sustenance

Since the start of the August 13th Shanghai battle, various charitable organizations and native-place associations in the city have set up refugee shelters one after another to accommodate refugees from the war zone. At that time, because of the large number of people, they were accommodating and relocating people to the interior. After the war situation changed, water and land transportation was blocked, and transporting refugees became quite a problem. However, various organizations are currently continuing to find ways to evacuate people. According to a survey report by the Public Health Department of the Municipal Council, on the 16th, there were still 141 refugee shelters inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 80,787 refugees. As for the more than 100,000 refugees accommodated in the refugee area of the Nanshi District, they are not included. As the weather gradually turns cold, there is still hope that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will generously donate sustenance, winter clothing, and other items for the large number of refugees, in order to save these refugees who are clamoring for food.

Red Swastika Clinic Lacks Medicine

Recently, a reporter visited the Chinese Medicine Clinic of the World Red Swastika Society at the intersection of Sima Road and Zhejiang Road. The director of the office, Tao Shanxian, and the director of medical affairs, Shen Jicang, warmly received him and showed him around the various sickrooms. Although the clinic was founded hastily, it is well-managed. It has more than 100 beds and also runs an outpatient department for diagnosis and treatment, so the doctors are working very hard. Their benevolence and medical skills are truly invaluable. However, according to the director of the clinic, the amount of medicinal materials used inside and outside the hospital (to treat and administer medicine in the Nanshi refugee area) every day is very large. Recently, various medicinal materials on the market have been in extremely short supply, and there are times when they may not be able to continue. Moreover, prices have increased, which is not without its difficulties. It is hoped that kind-hearted people from all walks of life and medicinal material firms will provide continuous assistance so that the medical problems of the general refugees will not be affected, and so that it can be maintained for a long time, which is truly immeasurable merit.

West Shanghai United Association Distributes Food

The West Shanghai United Relief Association has expanded its relief scope and universally provides food to refugees wandering the streets. Donations from all walks of life have become increasingly enthusiastic, and the association is entrusted to distribute them. Yesterday, the association received the following items: 4,000 large pancakes from Manli Barber Shop, 1,100 from the colleagues of the West Gate branch of Shanghai Bank, 2,400 from the colleagues of Huade Factory, 2,700 from Mr. Zhao, 1,000 from Mr. Shi Zhifu, 2,000 from Mr. Su, 1,018 from Mr. Tang, 3,340 from the colleagues of the pigment department of Bu Neimen Foreign Company, 12 packages of bread from Lixin Accounting Firm, 1,910 large pancakes and steamed buns from the tenants of Qingfu Lane, 7,000 loaves of bread from the Leather Industry Association, and 1,000 guangbing (crispy pancakes) from Jinlong Restaurant. All of the above items have been sent by the association to designated locations and distributed to refugees in various districts. However, due to the large quantity of items, there is a shortage of large burlap sacks for packing and transportation, so it is urgently hoped that people from all walks of life will provide more assistance. It is also necessary to borrow a truck in order to distribute food along the way. The association will absolutely be responsible for returning it after use. Please call 35627 to notify and contact us.

### More Than 10,000 Refugees in Xujiahui

The Xuhui Refugee Shelter Opens Rooms to Accommodate Them All

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Xujiahui Xuhui Refugee Shelter has begun to accommodate refugees, numbering more than 8,000. After the national army withdrew from the southwestern Nanshi of Shanghai, the number of refugees increased sharply. The director of the shelter, Mr. Zhang Jiashu, specially instructed the director, Brother Lu Shixi, to do everything possible to open more rooms to accommodate them, in order to reduce the suffering of the refugees and prevent them from wandering the streets. As of today, the number has reached more than 10,000. The shelter invites Chinese and Western doctors to diagnose and treat refugees' diseases every day. It also has a refugee school to teach refugee children knowledge, and publishes daily wall newspapers to inform refugees of the national situation. It also pays special attention to hygiene, cleanliness, and winter clothing. However, due to the large number of people, the funding is quite tight, and as the weather is getting colder, clothing and other items are most urgently needed. It is hoped that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will generously donate.

### Red Cross Rescue Team Begins Reorganization

Teams Staying in Shanghai Are Temporarily Disbanded, and Will Be Strictly Screened and Reorganized

Since the outbreak of the August 13th war, the Shanghai General Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society has been working closely with the Shanghai Rescue Committee to work hard on rescue efforts. The spirit of the rescue personnel distributed to various places has long been praised by the people of Shanghai and the wounded soldiers at the front. Recently, due to the shift in the war situation, the society's future rescue policy has also changed its plans accordingly. At the same time, the rescue team section of the directly affiliated rescue teams, for the sake of environmental convenience, is being handled independently by the Chinese Red Cross Society, and the rescue section is being renamed the rescue division. The affairs of the division are still being handled by the former director and deputy director, Mr. Ye Zhisheng and Mr. Zhang Zidao. In addition to the original 1st, 2nd, 5th and 3rd teams still at the front, and the 9th and 11th emergency teams having just departed for Suzhou to continue rescue work, the rescue teams staying in Shanghai have been temporarily disbanded. It is heard that after strict screening and reorganization, they will be able to depart for work. It is expected that in the shortest period of time, the society will have a considerable number of newly organized rescue units departing one after another to meet the needs of the front.

In addition, the general captain of the Rescue General Team of the United Charity National System Relief Association, Qu Wenliu, and the deputy general captain, Yin Guanzhi, recently ordered cadres Wu Yijun and others to leave Shanghai for Suzhou and then to the front line to supervise the work in order to achieve practical results.

### Refugee Shelter Children's Morning Exercises

The Shanghai Relief Committee's refugee shelter has organized a refugee children's school for the sake of out-of-school children. It has specially invited teachers to hold morning exercises at 6:00 a.m. every day to exercise their bodies and study their own books in order to avoid the pain of being out of school in the future.

The following important cases were then resolved: (1) The number of refugees is increasing daily and donations have been exhausted. How should the current situation be maintained? If it becomes impossible to raise funds, how should these 50,000 refugees in four hospitals be handled? It was resolved that everyone should make an effort. (2) Other temporary proposals: The Shanghai Relief Branch Association requested to take over and merge the operations. The resolution was passed.

### Songjiang Native-Place Joint Meeting

Discussing Relief for Fellow Refugees, Finding Ways to Investigate the Actual Situation in Songjiang

The Shanghai Songjiang Fellow Townsmen Association, in view of the fact that the entire territory of the hometown has been tragically bombed and massacred by Japanese soldiers, and the people have been displaced and are in a very pitiful situation, and that some of those who have fled to Shanghai are also unable to make ends meet, should find ways to provide relief. Therefore, the secretariat of the association initiated and convened a joint meeting of the association's executive directors and supervisors, as well as fair-minded gentry from Songjiang who came to Shanghai. The date was set for 4:00 p.m. today at 735 Foch Road (at the intersection of Avenue Albert) to discuss refugee relief matters. It is heard that the first step is to register the refugees in Shanghai, and the second step is to ask the Sheshan Catholic Church to assist in investigating the actual situation in Songjiang in order to find ways to provide appropriate relief.

### YMCA and Other Organizations Benefit Chinese Refugee Children

When the Western Youth Association held a dinner party on Tuesday of this week, the meeting also addressed the issue of providing cotton clothing to poor children. According to the Juvenile Division Committee of the Association, every Christmas it purchases items and gives them to poor Western children, which has been done for many years. No fewer than 500 boys and girls have enjoyed this benefit. This year, it will still be done as usual, so it will solicit funds from foreigners in this port, members of the association, and friends of members to implement this initiative. However, this year there are many Chinese children in various refugee shelters, all of whom urgently need cotton clothing to get through the winter. The Boy Scout Federation, the Western Youth Association, and other organizations will jointly appeal for them and plan to raise funds so that 1,000 Chinese children in refugee shelters can each receive a set of cotton clothing before Christmas to avoid the risk of freezing in the winter. In these two initiatives, 1,500 Chinese and foreign children will benefit. Fundraising will begin soon.

### Nanshi and Pudong Suffered Losses of 500 Million Yuan in the Fire Raid

Two to Three Hundred Thousand People Displaced

After Nanshi and Pudong fell, civilian houses, factories, institutions, and schools were all destroyed by fire. As a result, the flames filled the sky and sparks shone in all directions, and the fire lasted for four or five days in a row. All the buildings and people's property in the area were almost completely reduced to ashes, and as a result, 200,000 to 300,000 people were displaced. The situation was so tragic that it was rare in the world. According to a survey, the total losses suffered by our Nanshi and Pudong in this unprecedented washup totaled more than 500 million yuan. The largest losses were factories and pier stacking lines, followed by institutions and civilian houses.

### Achievements of the National Wartime Mutual Aid Association in Fundraising

Sponsoring Hospitals to Rescue Wounded Soldiers, and Presenting to the Government to Replenish National Use

Since its establishment last month, the National Wartime Mutual Aid Association has been quite active in international publicity and fundraising. It has created an English publication and sent it to people from various countries to make them understand the recognition and sympathy of our anti-Japanese war. At the same time, the members of the association, through Chen Bishi, Du Kunquan, and Mrs. Tang Shixuan, Mrs. Liu Jingfang, Ms. Li Xiaqing, Ms. Zhang Xiangying, and others, have also raised huge sums of money. In addition to sponsoring rescue hospitals to treat wounded soldiers, all of the money has been remitted to the government to replenish national use.

### Export Tax on Goat Wool and Sheep Wool Should Be Collected Separately

The Jianghai Customs Commissioner, in response to the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting that the export tax be collected separately based on the market prices of goat wool and sheep wool, replied yesterday that he approved the letter No. 1184 Shangzi of the 18th of this month, which stated that according to the letter from Tianyuanding Goat Shop, since the start of the war, the value of goat sold that was purchased in Pudong and other places was more than twice that of sheep wool. Because the customs' Nanka export tax valuation was not clearly demarcated, please reduce the amount, etc. After investigation, the current average market price of the imported large and small goats has been thoroughly investigated by this customs. The larger ones are indeed seven yuan each, and the smaller ones are three yuan each. This should be used as the basis for the tax-paying price for the time being. You are hereby informed to check and comply.

### The Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Native Goods and Coal Industries to Suppress Profiteering

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that vegetables and coal are essential items for people's lives and should be available from all sources, and profiteering should be suppressed. Yesterday, it sent separate letters to the Native Goods Industry Association and the Coal Industry Association to make appropriate plans. The Chamber of Commerce will also do its best to assist within its possible scope.

### The Central Bank's Relocation to Beijing Is Stipulated by the Organizational Law

The Shanghai Branch Continues to Operate and Handles Domestic and Foreign Exchange. The Central Bank Will Increase Cash and Silver Redemption by Two Yuan

The general offices of the four national banks, namely the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have all been relocated to the capital in accordance with the provisions of the organizational law.

The Central Bank's branches are also operating as usual in Shanghai.

### Casual Notes From Lieshan

— Feng Lieshan

The Source of Patriotic Donations

There are a total of two or three hundred overseas Chinese in Liverpool, England. Except for a few students, all of them are poor Chinese laborers. Their usual situation is similar to that of Mr. Wu Yaoru. The only difference is that Mr. Wu still has some savings in the bank, while they don't even have such savings.

After the nationwide anti-Japanese war broke out, they raised 700 pounds of British gold (equivalent to about 12,000 yuan in national currency) within a month, and at the same time subscribed to 9,000 yuan of national salvation public bonds. In the past two months, they will naturally have better results.

Their method of donation is also quite simple. At first, everyone tried their best to donate once. If they didn't have money, borrowing was the only option. The second step was to stipulate a long-term donation, paid once a week. This is also divided into two types: workers draw 5% of their salary, and vendors draw one-sixtieth of their daily business income. It is said that they can always donate dozens of pounds of British gold every week. They said that as long as the Japanese troops do not withdraw for a day, their fundraising will never stop.

Dozens of pounds of British gold a week from this group of overseas Chinese in Liverpool is a huge amount! In fact, it is not just the city of Liverpool. Wherever there are overseas Chinese, there is almost this enthusiastic atmosphere.

After hearing this news, a Chinese student in London said to the reporter: London is a little ashamed compared to Liverpool. An organization as large as the London Chinese Merchants Association has only donated a few dozen pounds this time. Even a few big figures only took out ten or fifteen pounds. It is people like Mr. Wu Yaoru who have added glory to the overseas Chinese in London!

After the reporter left London, there were reports in the newspaper that Mrs. Ambassador Guo had also donated her jewelry to the country, and the situation was probably different from before.

Berlin and China

After the announcement of our country's national budget案 for 1937-8, the German Frankfurt newspaper published an article titled Berlin and China, which mainly said:

"...China's total national income and expenditure is 100 million yuan, which is only equivalent to 740 million marks. In 1937, the budget for the city of Berlin was 878 million marks. The elders of Berlin are benefiting the 4.2 million citizens of Berlin, and the annual expenditure is 140 million marks more than the national budget of China, which has 7.1 million square miles and 400 million people... If we further study the income and expenditure in China's national budget, we will find it even more strange. Two-thirds of the national treasury income relies on customs and salt taxes. The income from direct taxes accounts for an unimportant position. Many European countries believe that the income tax of the national treasury only amounts to 25 million yuan annually, and the inheritance tax is even only 2 million yuan. The expenditure situation is as follows: The administrative expenses of the Ministry of Finance are very expensive, requiring 69 million yuan annually, accounting for 7% of the total expenditure. In contrast, the education fund is only 43 million yuan. The total of internal affairs and justice is only 10 million yuan..."

"Only one point seems completely identical to the financial distribution of European countries, that is, military expenditure accounts for 40% of the total expenditure... However, no European country now believes that spending one-third of the expenses of the city of Berlin on military expenditure can buy peace..."

This reporter's criticism is naturally purely based on the views of Europeans, forgetting the living standards of China. In fact, in many places, our one or two hundred yuan is equivalent to other people's one or two thousand yuan. The problem is not the small amount of national income, but whether the expenditure will be wasted. As long as public officials can achieve the point of contributing every bit to the public, a national treasury income of 100 million yuan a year can actually be equal to other people's 500 million yuan or even more.

### Mob Beats a Traitor to Death

Two Suspected Murderers Were Arrested, But Both Denied Participating in the Murder

On the morning of the 15th, an unidentified man, about 30 years old (wearing a black cloth jacket and trousers), was acting as a traitor and working in the area of Laobeimen, Min Guo Road. He was discovered by refugees gathered there, grabbed, and violently beaten, causing injuries to his head and face. He escaped into the French Concession, but was chased and insulted by the people. The police arrested the man and the pursuers and took them to the police station. Because there was no relationship after interrogation, both parties were released together. However, at 9:30 a.m. on the 16th, the man was again behind No. 37 Masnan Village, Masnan Road, Lujiawan, French Concession, asking the general public there about the soldiers' accommodation and storage locations of confiscated firearms near the Shanghai-Nanshi border. His traitorous actions were discovered by the people, who attacked and beat him en masse. The man was injured and fell unconscious. The crowd then dispersed and fled. At that time, Chen Hongtao (32 years old, from Pudong), who lived on Kangti Road and was a tailor, wrote the four characters "traitor's example" on white paper and placed it on the man's body. Police officer No. 591 stepped forward and arrested Chen. The suspected murderers, Chen Zhongyan (30 years old, from Suzhou, living at No. 39 Masnan Village, working as a street vendor in the Xinhua Knitting Factory), and others were taken to the French Central Police Station. At the same time, the man was sent to Guangci Hospital, where he died at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon despite treatment. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall for an autopsy. At noon yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Special First Court was asked to come to the hall for an examination. Chen Zhongyan and Chen Hongtao confessed after interrogation that they both denied committing the murder. However, police officer No. 591 testified that he saw Chen Zhongyan throwing stones at the deceased's lower abdomen. The court ordered a forensic re-examination. The deceased's body had slight injuries to the head, but no injuries to the lower body. According to the report of the investigator in charge of the case, it was found that the injuries to the head and face of the body were caused by the beating the day before, not by the incident. The official then ruled that the deceased had indeed died from the beatings, and the body was handed over to the hall for burial. The defendants were investigated and dealt with by the police department. At 3:00 p.m., the police sent the two Chen to the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court. Presiding Judge Liao interrogated them. Police Department lawyer Yao Zhaodi explained the case and requested an extension of the investigation for further interrogation. Then the investigator and police officer No. 591 reported the case. When interrogated, Chen Zhongyan confessed that at 9:30 that morning, he had just gotten up to wash his face when he heard that they were beating a traitor, and he went out to watch and was arrested immediately, and he did not commit the murder. Chen Hongtao also denied participating in the murder and only placed the writing on white paper on the deceased's body. After verifying the confession, the court ruled that the hearing would be adjourned to the morning of the 24th, and the defendants were temporarily detained.

### The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee Intensifies Its Work

Continuing Relief Efforts, Discussing Future Policies

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all the staff of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee have actively assisted the Chinese Red Cross Society in carrying out rescue of wounded soldiers and refugees, as well as hygiene matters. In order to intensify the work and continue the efforts, the committee held its regular meeting at the association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. In addition to reporting on the progress of the association's work, there was also a discussion on issues such as future policies.

### Confession of the Chinese Constable Who Shot the San Daotou After the Fact

Bystanders Were All Moved By It; It Was Ordered To Be Continued in a Week

Chinese Constable Wang Jingting, number 2423 of the Lao Zha Gate Police Station, originally served at the Huishan Police Station. After the outbreak of the war, he was assigned to the Lao Zha Gate Police Station. However, Wang's home had been burned down, and his father's whereabouts were unknown. His mother, wife, and three children were living with relatives. On the 6th of this month, Constable Wang was assigned to duty in front of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yu Qiaqing Road. At 11:45 PM, he went inside the hospital to relieve himself. Unfortunately, Inspector Wang Ruoshan, number 1676 of the Hua San Daotou, arrived and accused the constable of dereliction of duty. He issued a warning and threatened to report him to his superiors for punishment. Wang Jingting asked San Daotou number 919 to intercede and apologized to Wang Ruoshan, but to no avail. On the 11th, a similar incident occurred. Despite Wang's repeated pleas, number 1676 reported it to Chinese Chief Constable Liu Yaying. Chief Constable Liu ordered the two men to make a report and await further action. Then, late on the night of the 15th, number 2423 was assigned to duty in front of the temporary women's prison of the First Special District Court on Guangxi Road. All of his clothes had been burned in the fire, and he was feeling cold, so he leaned against the wall to take shelter. Number 1676 saw this and accused him of dozing off. Number 1676 threatened to report him again. Number 2423 pleaded desperately, as another report would surely lead to suspension, making it impossible to support his family. Number 1676 refused. At 7:00 AM yesterday, when his shift ended, he encountered number 1676 and pleaded again, but was rejected. At that moment, number 2423's nerves snapped. He suddenly fired six shots from his service pistol, hitting number 1676 in vital areas, killing him. San Daotou number 116 was also hit by stray bullets. Wang Jingting was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law, while lawyer Fan Gang defended Wang. During the trial, the defendant tearfully recounted the events, moving all the bystanders. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the confession and ordered a one-week adjournment for further investigation. The body of number 1676 was examined and ordered to be collected and buried.

### Bold Thieves Rob and Kill Victim on the Road

Four Shots Fired, Hitting the Head; Nanjing Road Also Sees a Watch Robbery

On Rue Robert, Shanghai West, around 3:00 PM yesterday, a pedestrian, identified as Mr. Jia, was passing through the area when three men emerged from the roadside. One of them, armed with a pistol, threatened and intimidated him, demanding that he hand over national currency. Mr. Jia shouted for help and struggled to escape. The thieves chased after him. Mr. Jia ran into an empty room at number 8 Rongqing Lane to hide, but the thieves broke down the door and fired four shots, one of which hit him in the head, killing him instantly. They looted an amount of national currency from his pockets. As the thieves walked out the gate, a young woman from number 7 was standing at the doorway. Hearing the gunshots, she shouted "Robbers!" The thieves also shot her in the left leg, and she fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The thieves fled the scene with their loot. After the incident, residents of the lane gathered and rushed to the scene. They summoned nearby police officers to transport the body to the morgue for examination. A business card with the name "Guo Xiangjie" was found in the deceased's pocket, but whether it belonged to the deceased was still under investigation by the police. The injured young woman was identified as Zhu Xu, about twenty years old.

Furthermore, at 5:20 PM yesterday, several bandits broke into the Xin Ji Watch Shop on Nanjing Road. One of them brandished a pistol, threatening and intimidating the staff. They robbed four Swiss watches and fled.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government Requesting Issuance of Permits for Transporting Rice from Eastern Zhejiang

Stopping Leakage and Regulating Surplus Benefit Both Sides; A Temporary Expedient to Alleviate the Emergency by Temporarily Using Foreign Ships for Transportation

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, requesting the issuance of permits for transporting rice from eastern Zhejiang. The telegram reads: "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government of Hangzhou. According to a letter from the Rice Dealers Association, Mr. Pan Jicheng, representative of Hengsheng Rice Shop on Lao Beimen Street in the French Concession, stated that since coming to Shanghai, the population of the Special District has suddenly increased several times. Recently, the war zone has gradually expanded, and refugees have flocked to the area, making the transport of food impossible, and the source has been cut off, resulting in panic. At the beginning of the war, it was still possible to rely on Suzhou, Changshu, Qingpu and other places to transport supplies to Shanghai by civilian boats, with thousands of piculs arriving every day. Now, the battle line has shifted west, and the roads are blocked, making it difficult to recover for a while. Millions of people are facing a shortage of food, and rice shops have sold out of their supplies, making it impossible to meet the needs of the market. The situation is very miserable, and those in the industry are saddened. Now, the Special District Public Works Department has ordered foreign rice to provide relief and stabilize people's hearts. However, this is an outflow of rights and a waste of the national economy. At this time of all-out resistance, the nation can block one leak, and the country will be stronger. Now, there are bumper harvests in various parts of the country, so there is no need to rely on foreign rice. However, due to traffic obstruction and production and sales imbalances, the mainland is feeling low grain prices harming farmers, and there is a surplus of grain. If regulated, both sides will benefit. It has been found that the three counties of Linhai, Huangyan, and Wenling in the old Taizhou Prefecture of Zhejiang Province are the most productive rice areas. This year's harvest is also abundant. The annual export of rice from that area reaches a huge amount of 200,000 to 300,000 piculs. When the production and sales were underway this year, it happened to coincide with the time of the War of Resistance, and navigation was cut off, so the rice-producing areas could not sell their rice outside and felt a great surplus. Recently, foreign ships have temporarily maintained traffic on the Shanghai-Taizhou route. We have consulted with the Chinese compradors of the ships to transport rice from the Taizhou area to Shanghai. They have agreed to find a way to transport it, but require a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce and an official permit to pass. Therefore, the small shop is going to that area to purchase rice to transport and sell to Shanghai. We plan to try to purchase 2,000 piculs of rice to transport to Shanghai for regulation. We earnestly request your esteemed Chamber to report the situation to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for certification, and to promptly telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to approve the issuance of a permit, instructing the three county governments of Linhai, Huangyan, and Wenling to allow transport. However, the small shop cannot transport 2,000 piculs of rice at one time. Please set the valid period of the permit to three months so that it can be used to purchase and transport successively. This matter concerns the people's food and the national economy of Shanghai. Please quickly approve and transfer it, etc. It has been found that the rice shop intends to go to the three prefectures of Lin, Wen, and Tai in Zhejiang to purchase rice to help the people of Shanghai during the extraordinary period, to stop the leakage of the economy, and to submit a letter of transfer. We hope that your esteemed Chamber will give certification and promptly telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to issue a permit to allow the rice shop to purchase 2,000 piculs of rice in the three counties and transport it to Shanghai successively within three months to relieve the food shortage. We are very much looking forward to it, etc. It has been received by the Chamber of Commerce. After the fall of Pudong, the people from various counties who fled to the concessions have increased several times. The traffic on the inland rivers has been cut off, and rice boats in the Suzhou and Songjiang areas have been blocked. Recently, the rice shops in the concession have only relied on the foreign rice stored by the Public Works Department for sale, which can only be temporary and not for long. Hengsheng Rice Shop plans to purchase 2,000 piculs of rice from the three counties of Lin, Huang, and Wen in eastern Zhejiang because there are foreign Shanghai-Taizhou ships sailing that can be attached for transportation. It is really a temporary emergency measure. We should ask your government to issue a permit for the rice shop to purchase 2,000 piculs of rice in the three counties, and set a period of three months as valid so that it can be loaded and transported in installments. It is really convenient for the public. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests the deletion."

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Capital's Administrative Organs Move West

— Appropriate

The war on the eastern front has shifted to the national defense line. The capital's military position has become all the more important. It is not only the national military command center but also a strategic point in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. At this time, it is necessary for the Five Yuan and other administrative organs to move to Chongqing and Wuhan. From now on, this magnificent city will be dedicated to military activities as the center of gravity. This will lead to more comprehensive defense effects and greater convenience in military command. As for the Five Yuan and administrative organs moving west, they will not be restrained by the effects of the war, and work efficiency can be improved. This goes without saying.

The capital has been bombed repeatedly since the start of the war. It would be reasonable to assume that the various administrative organs should have been moved earlier. However, due to thorough air defense and strict discipline, all personnel of our government, although constantly hearing alarms, have been stepping up their work locally. And the order of the capital during wartime is even more orderly than usual. The westward relocation of various agencies can clearly not be interpreted as instability in the capital's position. On the contrary, it precisely demonstrates the determination of our military and political authorities to defend the capital and resist to the end.

### Bloody Battle Unfolds South of Yangcheng Lake; Our Army Achieves Great Victory on the National Defense Line

Our Air Force Assists in Battle; Currently Pursuing the Victory and Counterattacking Kunshan; Fierce Battle for Ten Hours, Killing Enemies Like Hemp; Enemy Casualties Are Extremely Heavy; There Is Fierce Fighting on the Suzhou-Jiashan Road; Our Army Flanks and Attacks Pingwang in Multiple Routes

Military News: For days, enemy troops have invaded westward along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway from Kunshan. Yesterday, they engaged in a battle with our army in the southern area of Yangcheng Lake. There are many rivers and streams in that area, and we have strong fortifications to defend for a long time. A certain main force unit has been fighting desperately to resist, and after a fierce battle lasting ten hours, the enemy suffered more than half casualties. The remaining enemy troops have collapsed and retreated. It has been found that the enemy troops involved were the Ito, Fuji, and Wakizaka units. Their purpose was to invade Suzhou. After this major blow, it seems that they no longer have the ability to counterattack. Also, late last night, a certain Westerner in this city received a front-line radio message, which briefly stated that our army was fighting a life-and-death battle with the enemy at Qian Dayang, a railway station in Zhengyi, west of Kunshan, and that dozens of our aircraft were assisting in the battle, killing enemies like hemp. The enemy casualties were extremely heavy, and our army is currently pursuing the victory and counterattacking Kunshan.

### After Our Army Rotated Defenses West of Kunshan, the Frontline Situation Has Changed

Japanese Army's Advance in Zhengyi Has Come to a Halt; Suzhou Has Turned From Danger to Safety; Wangjiangjing Has Also Been Saved

The Continental Daily reported: According to news obtained from Chinese and foreign sources last night (the 17th), the Japanese army failed to take advantage of the opportunity of the Chinese army's defense rotation west of Kunshan for twenty-four hours to advance towards Suzhou along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line. In addition, the heavy rains of the past two days have allowed the Chinese army defending the "Hindenburg Line" to consolidate its position. Therefore, the Japanese army has now suddenly encountered resistance, and its advance in Zhengyi has come to a halt. The Chinese army's front line is about eighty-five miles long. According to foreign estimates, no fewer than 400,000 troops are defending the front line. Many senior commanders who fought in Shanghai are now personally supervising the battle on the front line. The fighting on the front line was relatively quiet yesterday. Japanese aircraft were unable to operate due to rain, so the Chinese army was able to consolidate its defenses. The arrival of fresh troops on the Zhengyi front has changed the situation in Suzhou. At present, it has turned from danger to safety. The precarious situation of Wangjiangjing in Wujiang has also been reversed. After occupying Jiashan, the Japanese army advanced near these two locations. A large number of Chinese reinforcements have now entered the area, and fierce fighting is currently underway, so the Japanese army has no way to continue advancing.

### Japanese Major General Tezuka Wounded Near Jiashan

There Is Fierce Fighting Southwest of Jiashan; Enemy Troops in Pingwang Are Trapped in a Desperate Situation

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th, Reuters: According to today's Army Ministry Bulletin, Major General Tezuka Shozo was wounded near Jiashan on November 8th.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th, Reuters: According to news received here, there is fierce fighting southwest of Jiashan. Japanese troops on the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line are currently attacking Zhengyi. Japanese warships on the Yangtze River are reportedly shelling the Chinese army's left flank in the Fushan area.

According to sources in transportation circles, the enemy troops who advanced along the railway line from Jiashan to attack Jiaxing were repelled by our army to the area of Qilibu and Tangwanzhen. After reorganization and replenishment, they joined forces with the enemy near Wangjiangjing at noon yesterday, encircling Jiaxing from the northeast in two directions. Our army also divided and bravely blocked the attack from the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Jiashan lines, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the area north of Qilibu to Nangongdang. In addition, the enemy in the Pingwang area launched a fierce attack northwards in the past two days, attempting to enter Wujiang and put pressure on Suzhou in order to cut off the rear of the Shanghai-Nanjing line. Our army, with Suzhou as a key town on the national defense line, is determined to defend it. At present, they have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy near Shenghu north of Pingwang, and have flanked and attacked Pingwang in multiple routes. Therefore, the enemy troops in that area are currently trapped in a desperate situation.

### Fushan Artillery and Langshan Garrison Troops Flank and Attack Enemy Warships

Enemy Troops in the Suburbs of Changshu Have Also Been Repelled by Our Army; Currently at a Stalemate in the Area North of Dahengjing

Military News: Dozens of enemy warships have gathered on the river surface in the area of Xianshengqiao Town and Gengjingkou. Since the day before yesterday, they have been constantly bombarding our Fushan positions, attempting to land. Our Fushan artillery and the Langshan garrison on the opposite bank have flanked and attacked the enemy warships, and the artillery fire has been extremely fierce. The enemy troops have suffered considerable damage. As of yesterday morning, the two sides were still engaged in artillery battles. Our side has heavy troops distributed in Wangshuzhen to Xiaojiaqiao and along the Fushan Ditch, relying on solid defenses. The enemy's conspiracy will definitely not succeed. Also, news has it that the enemy advancing from Zhitangzhen towards Changshu in two routes, numbering about two regiments, was once pushed to the suburbs outside the city. After a fierce counterattack by our army, the enemy was unable to withstand and retreated. Currently, they are at a stalemate in the area north of Dahengjing, east of Changshu.

### Fierce Artillery Battles at Zhapu

Our Artillery Positions Are Very Dangerous; Enemy Warships Have Been Repeatedly Threatened; Currently Defending Strategically and Counterattacking with a Certain Army Joining

After landing at Jinshanwei, the enemy disturbed Suzhou and Zhejiang in Quan Gongting. In the Zhapu area, the enemy attacked Xincang and Yutang. To attack Pinghu, they tried to flank and attack the Zhapu rear from Shuikou and Xinxing. Our army defended strategically. In the past three days, a certain army joined the counterattack, and the momentum was quite strong. Seeing that they could not succeed, the enemy successively moved the enemy warships outside Jinshanmen to the Caiqigang sea area in Hangzhou Bay and bombarded them with volley fire. The previous day, the enemy used a trick to try to steal a crossing in Haiyan by motorboat. At that time, the situation was quite tense. Fortunately, our army's defense was solid, and the terrain was superior, with a commanding height, which had been blocked early. Currently, both sides are using artillery battles, especially on the 13th, which was the most fierce. Our artillery positions are very dangerous, and the range of XX and other places is relatively short. Enemy warships have been repeatedly threatened and suffered heavy losses. In the past few days, the enemy has also used a large number of aircraft to bomb along the way, hoping to destroy them. However, the coastline there is tortuous and has a lot of resistance, making it difficult to hit. Except for the nearby houses being destroyed, the military buildings were not damaged at all. Most of the shells fell on the sea surface, and the waves splashed, like a tidal wave. When a certain gentleman escaped on the 13th, our reinforcements arrived, so Zhapu was still stable. The enemy's reinforcements have continued to land in the Jinshanwei and Jinshanzui areas in recent days, and the Tanjishan, forty to fifty miles from the coast, is used as a transportation hub, it is said.

### The Situation of the Battle on All Fronts Is Excellent

Changshu, Suzhou, and Wujiang Have Been Tragically Bombed

In recent days, enemy aircraft have appeared from time to time in Changshu, Wujiang, Suzhou, and other places, and have dropped heavy bombs indiscriminately in the countryside. Changshu and Wujiang have been the most severely damaged, and most of the buildings have been destroyed. The city and suburbs of Suzhou, from Changmen to the Huangchangji area, have been tragically bombed, and many civilians have been killed and injured. Therefore, the situation in the war zone is smooth, and our army's positions are very solid. Fushan, Changshu, Zhengyi, Bazhang, Jiaxing, and Zhapu are all in our army's hands, and we are actively counterattacking. When the enemy troops delve deep, they are ambushed by our army's guerrillas, so the losses are extremely heavy. At present, the most fierce fighting is in Pingwang and Zhengyi. Our army is lined up by the water, and the situation is excellent. Therefore, the various rumors that have been circulating in recent days have been disproved.

### Enemy Reinforcements Arriving in Shanghai in the Past Half Month Have Exceeded 60,000

Enemy Warships Have Also Transported a Large Number of Munitions and Bamboo Rafts

This morning (the 18th) at around 8:00 AM, the No. 260 transport ship Taiheimaru, converted from an enemy merchant ship, the No. 194 transport ship Toneimaru, and another transport ship of unknown number, a total of three ships, successively sailed into Shanghai and docked at the Osaka and Hongkou wharves. In addition to carrying the seventh batch of the tenth batch of enemy reinforcements, about 2,000 people, a large number of iron plates were also transported. In total, the enemy reinforcements who have arrived in Shanghai in the past half month have exceeded 60,000.

This morning (the 18th) at around 7:00 AM, the small enemy transport ships Third Dragon Maru, Sea Life Maru, Yangtai Maru, Twelfth Unkai Maru, Hirota Maru Fifth Ship, fully loaded with bamboo rafts and munitions, sailed into Shanghai. They are temporarily berthed at the Chinese Wharf of the Pudong China Merchants Bureau, the Xinhuishan Wharf, and the Mitsubishi Wharf, preparing to join the small transport ships Matsumaru, Aoi Maru, Momo Maru, Sanwa Maru, and Thirteenth Unkai Maru, which also arrived yesterday (the 17th) fully loaded with bamboo rafts, totaling ten ships, and sail to the upper reaches of the Wusong River within a few days. In addition, dozens of small steamboats originally docked in South Huangpu were towed by the enemy to the wharf area near Mitsubishi Wharf. In addition to painting the numbers on the chimneys of each ship, most of them have been sailed by the enemy to the upper reaches of the Wusong River for use. Only three or four ships remain parked at the Mitsubishi Wharf.

### England, America and France have Consensus to Jointly Maintain International Law and Order

Guo Taiqi Issues a Statement; Satisfied with the Beijing Conference

[London] After returning to London from Beijing, Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Guo Taiqi met with a Reuters diplomatic reporter and said that an obvious consensus has been discovered in the informal talks between representatives of the countries attending the Beijing Conference, thinking that the Far East crisis must not be allowed to drag on with empty discussions. He felt that the Beijing Conference has adopted a satisfactory path, and its clear and direct response to Japan's refusal to participate is even more powerful, because the Beijing Conference has always shown patience and consideration to Japan. The remarks of the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are extremely important. They unanimously emphasized respect for treaties, taking this as the only basis for the orderly civilized life between countries; otherwise, the world will fall into a state of lawlessness. The consistency of the three countries' representatives' remarks is also a response to the Anti-Communist Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is said. Ambassador Guo and his wife attended a banquet hosted by the King in Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. Ambassador Guo plans to return to Beijing tomorrow (Central News Agency 18th, Reuters).

### Administrative Conditions in Tianjin and Beijing Under Japanese Control

Concessions Have Not Suffered Interference; British Undersecretary Replies to a Member's Question; Labor Member Urges Government to Ban Munitions to Japan

[London] Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne said in the House of Commons today in response to a conversation with Conservative Party member Moore Liam that Foreign Secretary Eden has not received any reports of trade encountering any obstacles in the British Concession in Tianjin. He believes that the concessions have not suffered any interference. As for the administration of Tianjin and Beijing, since the Japanese army occupied them, there has been an organization called the Tianjin-Beijing Security Maintenance Association, led by Gao Lingwei. This association is assisted by many Japanese advisers (Chinese officials are prepared to cooperate with the Japanese authorities, and those who are recognized by the Japanese authorities as having the trust of the local people seem to hold responsible positions. The local people seem to have tacitly approved of this type of administration, it is said). Former Indian Affairs Minister Penn asked Cranborne whether he believed that the Chinese people had recognized this pseudo-regime. Cranborne replied that, according to what he had heard, the Chinese people in North China had "recognized" it, but he felt that this type of question should not be raised. Penn then asked Cranborne whether he recognized the Japanese side's view that the Security Maintenance Association had been well received by the people. Cranborne replied that he could not continue to make statements other than what he had already answered (Central News Agency 17th, Reuters).

[London] Labor member Henderson asked Undersecretary of State Cranborne in the House of Commons today whether, in view of the resolutions of the Beijing Conference, the British government will suggest to the countries concerned that, on the one hand, they stop supplying munitions to the Japanese army, and on the other hand, they continue to supply munitions to China as needed. Cranborne replied that the countries that passed the declaration on Monday at the Beijing Conference are currently considering what their common attitude should be to deal with the position adopted by Japan and to abide by their obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Pact. However, before the Beijing Conference continues to meet, it is not possible to predict the chances of reaching an agreement on any joint action. Henderson also said that if China needs assistance, there must be active behavior in addition to passing resolutions, and asked Cranborne to pay attention to this point. Conservative Adams asked whether it was planned to adopt a collective pressure plan to restrain the aggressor country in the Far East. Cranborne asked him not to raise this question. Labor member Noel-Baker asked whether the government believed that the Beijing Declaration did not conflict with the Geneva resolution condemning Japan as an aggressor country. Cranborne replied "does not conflict" (Central News Agency 17th, Reuters).

### Halifax's Schedule in Germany

Scheduled to Meet Hitler Today; US Ambassador to France Will Visit Berlin

[Berlin] British Lord Privy Seal Halifax arrived here yesterday to participate in the International Hunting Exhibition. At Hitler's request, he will meet with Mr. Hitler in Berchtesgaden today. German Foreign Minister Neurath will accompany him. Mr. Halifax will probably hold talks with Mr. Hitler on Friday and return to Berlin that night. It is expected that the issues discussed will be wide-ranging, including the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Western European Pact to replace the Locarno Pact. It is the intention of all circles in Germany that Mr. Hitler carefully consider clarifying Britain's attitude towards the German and Italian interference in the Spanish war and Germany's Central European policy (Central News Agency 18th, Reuters).

⊙ Warsaw U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt, who is currently visiting Poland, made a statement to reporters last night at a banquet hosted by Polish Foreign Minister Beck, declaring that he will go to Berlin on his way back to France for a twenty-four hour stay to exchange views with the French Ambassador to Germany, Ambassador François-Poncet (Haitong Telegraph, 17th).

### Most of the Enemy Troops in Central Shanxi Are Moving Towards Fenyang

There Will Be Fierce Fighting Within the Day; We Are Already Prepared

⊙ Linfen The war situation in central Shanxi has been slightly quiet in recent days, but the enemy is still actively replenishing and plotting to invade south. Our troops on all routes have been carefully prepared to fight back. It is expected that there will be fierce fighting within the day. The following is a summary of the situation in recent days: (1) More than a thousand enemy troops who previously sneaked between Pingyao and Jiexiu were defeated after being severely attacked by our army. The enemy forces could not hold on, and collapsed and retreated. On the 16th, a unit of our army had tracked, detoured, and pursued to near Yuci. Jiexiu is still being firmly defended by our army. (2) Five hundred enemy troops who disrupted Zihongzhen east of Qixian were fiercely attacked head-on by a certain unit of our army on the 16th and 17th. The enemy was almost completely wiped out. (3) Most of the enemy has recently moved towards Fenyang, with the intention of invading Fenyang and Lingshi. (4) In recent days, the enemy has been active near Jiaocheng with several tanks and a small number of plainclothes teams. (5) Ten enemy tanks and four to five hundred infantry and cavalry have sneaked into Qingyuan (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th).

### How the Authorities Will Dispose of Our Soldiers and Officers Who Have Retreated into the Concessions

Future Possibility of Restoring Freedom, Approximately Six Thousand in Both Concessions

According to a report in the Shanghai Times, the disposal of our loyal soldiers, security forces, and police who have retreated into the International Settlement and the French Concession is considered a difficult problem by the authorities of both concessions. The total number of soldiers, police, and security forces disarmed and retreated into the two concessions is six thousand. The International Settlement only has three hundred and fifty people, namely the famous Four Hundred Lone Soldiers who defended Zhabei. The number in the French Concession is larger, and the burden on the French Concession is naturally heavier. According to a statement made by the International Settlement authorities to reporters of the Times a few days ago, if the Japanese side agrees, the soldiers sheltered in the concession should be granted freedom as soon as possible. Our side will not object to this disposal. Since the Japanese side has left Shanghai due to the war, it is unlikely that they will create difficulties in this disposal. However, there is one fact that we must recognize: the International Settlement, by its nature, is a municipal organization and not a sovereign state. In other words, the International Settlement authorities have no obligation to shelter these soldiers until the end of the war. Presumably, the French Concession authorities also hold the same view. We still remember that during the last European War, neutral Switzerland sheltered a large number of soldiers from the belligerent countries who entered its territory. After the end of the European War, the foreign soldiers sheltered in Switzerland were sent back to their home countries by Switzerland, and the countries to which these soldiers belonged compensated for the cost of supplies. It has been suggested informally to the French Concession authorities that the same method could be adopted for the five thousand soldiers who disarmed and retreated into the concession from the Nanshi area after the war is over. However, one thing makes this situation more complicated: this war is an undeclared war, and there is no formal declaration of war. This makes the status of the soldiers who have retreated into the concession even more ambiguous. As of now, the cost of supplying the soldiers who have retreated into the concession is not a heavy burden for the authorities of the two concessions because Chinese charities have donated a large amount of funds. However, it is not known whether this source of funding will become a problem as time goes on.

### Two Municipal Ferries Were Seized by the Enemy

Flags on the Ferries Were Replaced; Sandboats Were Also Seized

According to the Central News Agency, Municipal Ferries No. 4 and No. 5, which operate between the Bund and Gaoqiao, were also seized by enemy troops using small steam launches and are now berthed at buoy No. 22 on the Huangpu River. The flags on the ferries have all been replaced with enemy flags.

A large number of sandboats berthed near the blockade line of the Shiliupu pier, except for a portion that was burned by the enemy troops a few days ago, the remaining boats with relatively intact hulls are now also being towed away by the enemy troops using steamships and sailed to Wusongkou and the southern Huangpu area for use in transporting reinforcements and military supplies.

### Traitors and Gangsters Are Taking Advantage of the Situation

Looting Property in the Nanshi Area; Openly Auctioning and Selling Stolen Goods

The fire in the Nanshi area has been raging for nearly a week, and remnants of the fire are still smoldering in the area inside Xiaoximen. However, Nanshi had no military preparations for the March Resistance, and the area near the city had been relatively peaceful since the Japanese only bombed the South Railway Station once. Therefore, even if some residents temporarily fled to the concessions, most of their movable property was not taken with them. By the time things became critical, transportation was cut off, so there was actually a lot of hidden property inside. After the fire, gangsters and traitors colluded with each other to loot movable property in the area, and auctions were openly held in places such as Tangjiawan. As a result, a group of hooligans from other provinces and local gangsters devised ways to get from the concessions to Nanshi, first surrendering to the traitors to seek wealth. The ginseng and bird's nest shops in Xian Gua Street caught fire, and the gangsters took out two boxes of ginseng from the ashes, while the soybeans and wheat in the soybean and wheat shops were transported to Beishi and sold. However, the Japanese do not trust these speculative Chinese.

### British Under-Secretary Clarifies Foreign Policy

Currently Working Hard to Find a Solution; Seeking a Comprehensive Solution to the International Situation

[London] Viscount Samuel, in a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Lords today, advocated separating the Covenant of the League of Nations from the Treaty of Versailles, saying that as long as the methods of 1919 are not removed from the Covenant of the League of Nations, the current tense situation will not end. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Butler replied that the British government, like any other, is extremely eager to promote a large-scale solution to the various difficult problems in the world. The government does not adhere to the policy of limited negotiations on specific issues, although the government is sometimes forced to do so, but it always takes a large-scale solution as its basic goal. The government is well aware that in the current world problems, only a few can be resolved independently from other problems. As for the visit of Lord Privy Seal Halifax to Germany and the colonial issue, he did not want to say anything about it at this time. The debate was initiated by Lord Arran, who asked the government to explain the procedures advocated by the British government for final negotiations on a comprehensive solution within the framework of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris.

### Brief Commentary

— Xiang

The Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Except for the Italian representative who opposed it, the other countries can be said to be unanimous. Even if Denmark, Norway, and Sweden abstained, it was because they had very little knowledge of the Far East relationship. And the principle of the declaration is indeed agreed upon. So the attitude of the countries does not seem to be not common. But this kind of commonality is a commonality on the mouth. And commonality in meaning. Cannot be regarded as a common attitude. What kind of attitude will each country use towards the Far East incident proposed by the conference? A common solution. It remains to be seen at the next meeting. But anticipate how the next meeting will be. It can be determined by the declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference the day before yesterday. Therefore, American newspapers commented. The lukewarm declaration is not as good as the resolutions passed by the League of Nations in the past. Then its words can be imagined. Therefore, I said that the participating countries. Although the declarations are common. And the real attitude. I'm afraid it can't be common. If truly common. There should be a clearer attitude.

### Casual Notes from Lieshan

The Gradual Change in the British Attitude

The attitude of the British towards the current Sino-Japanese War can be divided into several stages. Before the July 7th Incident, everyone's attention was focused on the Spanish Civil War and the Mediterranean issue. They had no time to care about the Far East. After Japan's aggressive policy was launched again, the average Briton initially held a soothing attitude, hoping to turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems. It was not until the August 13th Shanghai Battle occurred that the British realized that things were not good. The achievements of our army's resistance, however, made the British both happy and worried. Happy that the Chinese people actually have this strength, worried that the British industry in Shanghai alone is said to be more than 300 million yuan, and they would feel the pain of this loss. But in any case, from this time on, the British have abandoned their attitude of passively advising Japan and turned to passively sympathizing with China. Naturally, this sympathy is limited.

After the incident of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, being wounded by a Japanese plane, the British attitude took a further step. This unfortunate incident gave the British people a very deep impression. Because this is an insult, damaging the British people's self-esteem. Thirty or forty years ago, wouldn't the wounding of a British ambassador be a pretext for a declaration of war? (At least that's the common people's view, politicians naturally have a different view.) Several acquaintances have given several lectures in London. Each time, the audience always expressed to them that everyone absolutely sympathized with China. Unfortunately, the current British military strength is insufficient to provide substantial assistance. The words imply a gesture of rubbing their fists and palms. The British are a nation that does not express emotions. It is not easy to have such a passionate attitude this time.

While in London, I spoke with a certain gentleman in the British political world about the Sino-Japanese issue. At that time, the reporter pointed out that the British attitude of "watching the fire from across the river" was inappropriate, and their sympathy for the Chinese people's resistance was not as active as their sympathy for the Spanish People's Front government. However, the gentleman had a different view. He believes that sympathy for the Spanish government is only from the British left wing and middle class. But for China, there is unanimous sympathy regardless of the right or left. As long as a considerable amount of time passes, the British people will definitely have further expressions.

Before the British had further expressions, the Japanese shouted out, saying that this war was not a Sino-Japanese war but an Anglo-Japanese war.

The Japanese saying this is, of course, irrelevant at the moment.

### First Batch of War Zone Refugees to Be Relocated to Set Off Within Days

Relocation Sites Designated as Gaochun and Liyang; Jiangsu Provincial Government Allocates 35,000 Mu of Land

According to a person in charge of the War Zone Refugee Relocation Association, since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the Association, in view of the fact that the refugees in the war zone have no homes to return to, which is indeed pitiful, has actively planned the relocation of refugees in the war zone. The original plan was: ⑴ The Jiangnan area will first be trialed in Jiangsu Province; ⑵ Refugees from the coastal provinces in South China will be relocated to Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces; ⑶ Refugees from Shandong, Hebei, and Henan in North China will be relocated to Shaanxi and Gansu in the Northwest. The first batch of one thousand people can set off within days. The locations are Gaochun and Liyang, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government has allocated 35,000 mu of land. All procedures have been completed. In the future, the new village plan will adhere to the principles of public operation, public consumption, and striving for production. One thousand people will be a village, and two hundred and fifty people will be a village unit. The distribution of the productive forces of a village is about six times for men and two times for women. As of today, the number of people solicited to go to work has reached five to six hundred. After selection, about four thousand people will go to take on the guidance work of education, agriculture, and handicrafts. The Association's funding, in addition to the construction of agricultural tools and eight months of living expenses, requires about 50,000 yuan.

### Nanshi Area Still Burning

A Price Must Be Paid to Take Out Belongings; Traitors and Gangsters Selling Poisons

Last night in the Nanshi area, at Xiaoximen, Shangwen Road, and both Dananmen gates, the fires reached the sky. This morning's investigation of the houses along Shangwen Road revealed that half had been burned. The area near Dananmen has been turned to ashes, owing to the destruction of the telephone bureau there, as well as the areas near Jiangyin Street on the west side, and the sugar mill lane behind the Foge Temple near Xiaonanmen. Approximately two to three hundred corpses that have been killed in recent days have all been thrown into the flames to be burned in place of burial. Any refugees that have not escaped are all arrested and the three characters "Dai Nippon" are tattooed on their arms to force them to act as defensive construction workers. After this tattoo, they are allowed to pass. On the traitor side, there are now even certain companies being set up; if any Nanshi residents wish to go to Nanshi to retrieve their belongings, they must pay a price equal to more than half the value of their belongings to be able to pass. Although there are many soliciting, no one is contacting. Now there is also a new type of Jehol soil and white powder being discovered, sold by traitors and gangsters; it is expected that if Nanshi is open, it will become a world of poison.

The fire in Nanshi had already subsided slightly yesterday morning, but unexpectedly, it was burned again in the afternoon and evening. The fire at Anlan Road and Fangxie Road outside Ximen was the worst. At night, the red light filled the sky and the flames were raging. The fires in smaller areas such as Menghua Street and Xieqiao were smaller. By this morning, the fire at Anlan Road had burned almost completely, and white smoke was now rising from the site. The fire site covers a very large area, and the nearby Fangxie Road, Xilinheng Road, Dalin Road, Dajilu, and the middle section of Linyin Road are directly connected to the previously burned Lujiabang Road, a scorched earth, with a desolate appearance. The fires in other areas such as the city, and Longhua Road, Xietu Road, and Liyuan Road in Hunan, have extinguished themselves. This morning at around 9:00, a fire broke out again near Nanmatou, burning fiercely. There were two fires in total, one at the Xuejiabang pig trade pier and the rice pier, and the other near Ping'an Bridge, which were still burning at noon.

Another report says that yesterday, Japanese ruffians shipped a large amount of opium from Dalian and transported it to Hongkou and Zhabei to lure local ruffians to sell it everywhere, at a price of nine yuan per liang. At a time when our country's ban is so strict, the ruffians are actually transporting this thing to harm the people, which shows their intentions.

### Actively Soliciting National Salvation Bonds

Hankou Central Bank Is the General Receiving Office; The Business Community Corps to Announce Results for the Second Time

Those with excellent results will be submitted to the government by the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Corps for commendation.

### Japanese Textile Mills in West Shanghai Trying to Resume Work

Lack of Workers; No Date Set for Resumption

After the war left Shanghai, the Japanese textile mills in the International Settlement area, as Japanese expatriates in Shanghai continued to return to Shanghai, have reportedly been trying to resume work. However, due to the extreme shortage of workers, it is difficult to resume work, and White Russians will be used instead.

### Collecting Old Newspapers

Sending to the Nearest Shed Shelter

The Chinese Midwives Association has appointed Dr. Wang Boyuan to inspect the various refugee shelters and found that there are many cases of infantile paralysis, and the reason for this is that it is caused by exposure to wind and cold. Because the shed shelters are lined with oil paper on top to prevent leakage, but the four sides are only reed doors, which cannot block the penetration of cold wind, it has been decided to use newspapers to paste them. It is hoped that all sectors of society will make donations of used newspapers for waste utilization and send them directly to the nearest shed shelters to benefit the refugees.

### The Truth Comes to Light in the Case of Two Adulterers Murdering Their Concubine

The Reason for Shen Yuzhen's Murder; Shi Shengqi Is Being Strictly Apprehended

Shen Yuzhen, wife of Huang Wei Yuan, owner of the "American Dried Grapes Company" located at No. 13, Lane 296, Rue du Consulat, French Concession, was murdered on the 3rd of this month by Shi Shengqi, a resident of Jiading who had ceased partnership with the company, in Room 201 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. At that time, Shi fabricated a note in the room to indicate that she had committed suicide. However, after investigation by Detective Zhang Yuanjing of the Laozha Police Station, it was determined that the handwriting of the note belonged to Huang Kejia, a resident of Jiading who had also ceased working as a street salesman for the "American Company," and Huang was summoned to the police station. After comparing the handwriting, it was clear that the note was written by Huang, so he was immediately detained. However, Huang resolutely denied participating in the case and was escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. During a rescheduled hearing, after strict interrogation by the detectives, Huang confessed the details. The reason was that Huang Shen Yuzhen had an affair with Shi Shengqi, an employee of the shop. Later, Huang Wei Yuan found out about it and dismissed Shi two years ago. Shen then shifted her affections to Huang Kejia, having relations with him three times. Unexpectedly, Huang Wei Yuan found out about this in August of this year and dismissed Huang as well. Since then, Huang Kejia and Shen met at the home of Yau, a doorman. Huang even borrowed 90 yuan from Yau. Then, on the 2nd of this month, Huang Kejia suddenly received a note from Shi Shengqi, inviting him to Room 201 of the Central Hotel. When Huang arrived that evening, he saw Shi and Shen together. Shen was only wearing a short shirt and pants. Shi then ordered Shen to temporarily hide in the bathroom, and then told Huang that Shen was naturally lewd, sleeping with many men, so he wanted to kill her. He then ordered Huang to write a note (the suicide note), and then asked Shen to come out. Shi then saw her take a towel and put it around Shen's neck, dragging her into the bedroom. Huang at that time still thought they were playing around, but when he entered the bedroom, he saw that she had already died. Shi then told Huang to help move the body to the bathroom, and Huang was terrified and fled. The detectives brought Huang to the room, and Huang gave a detailed demonstration of the situation at that time and wrote a confession. This morning, he was escorted again to the First Special District Court. The police station lawyers, Ru Baoyi and Lizhi Shan, explained the previous situation and filed a lawsuit against him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered a rescheduling for further questioning. This suspicious case has now been completely clarified and was caused by jealousy. The police station is now strictly apprehending Shi Shengqi.

### Shanghai Maritime Administration Closes

The Shanghai Maritime Administration of the Ministry of Transportation is an agency that inspects ships, handles registration, and protects navigation safety. Therefore, it also has a committee to fairly resolve incidents such as collisions between ships during navigation. Since the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the Bureau has made many arrangements for regulating inland waterway navigation. Now, due to the change in the war situation and the obstruction of inland waterways, the Bureau has received orders from the Ministry to temporarily close all its affairs from today.

### Foreign Exchange Returns to Normal

British and American Exchange Rates Are Very Strong

Foreign exchange has returned to normal. Foreign banks buy and sell based on their standards for ordering or selling goods. Chinese merchants rarely buy. The Japanese exchange rate is still virtually suspended. The British and American exchange rates seem to be very strong because the end of the month is approaching.

### Departure Date of the German Ping Steamer to Ningbo Today Undecided

Passengers Have Already Boarded; Awaiting Ningbo Telegram to Decide

After the three steamers, Xin Beijing, Ende, and German Ping, which operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, were ordered to temporarily suspend sailing, the Xin Beijing steamer was changed to operate on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, and the Ende steamer was changed to operate on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line. At the request of various groups in Shanghai, the German Ping steamer is scheduled to continue sailing to maintain transportation. The Huayi Company telegraphed Ningbo yesterday morning for instructions and began selling tickets first. By 5:00 p.m. yesterday, no reply telegram had been received, so the departure did not take place. Whether it will depart today depends on the reply telegram from Ningbo. Passengers who have purchased tickets are all on board, but as of noon today, no reply telegram has been received.

### Merchant Corps Established in the Refugee Area

Shen Xinfu Is Recommended to Be Responsible for Handling

In the Nanshi refugee area, in order to maintain the small-scale buying and selling of goods for the refugees, a part of the shops are still open for business. Therefore, the merchants organized a temporary merchant corps and recommended Shen Xinfu to be responsible for handling it, and have consulted with the International Relief Association.

### Nanyuan Bookstore Will Dedicate One Day to Relief Efforts

In addition to the original programs, Zhu Guoliang, a Suzhou opera star, will voluntarily participate in the evening show.

### Dredging Bureau Announces Two High Tides Next Month

### A Tragic Scene in Paradise

— Ye Bing

One of the Street's Miscellany

The Great Shanghai has fallen! In the concessions sheltered behind iron gates, the sound of revelry continues, the neon lights in front of the dance halls competing with the firelight of the Nanshi district. The gentlemen and ladies sitting in the movie theaters perhaps don't believe that just beyond the iron gates, there is a refugee area as dark and hopeless as hell; or perhaps, because of the zealous propaganda on the radio, they were once moved to give a sum of money amidst laughter, earning themselves the title of philanthropist. But there are countless more lives who have blindly crammed into the concessions. They didn't bring the property they had in the war zone—they wanted to protect their lives but lost all their property, yet they don't know that a life without property is also unprotected. The rent, as calculated by the sub-landlords, scares them so much they stick out their tongues. A small room costs twenty dollars, and after running around all day, it seems like the area of the concessions has suddenly shrunk. To find a red notice advertising a rental, one almost has to strain their eyes. Thus, the sidewalks by the roads and under the covered passages in the alleys have become their places of "temporary shelter from the wind and rain."

Even if the housing problem is solved, can you just sit idly with an empty stomach? Although the People's Food Regulation Committee strictly prohibits rising rice prices, isn't the covert reduction in the quality and weight of the rice a clear increase in prices? This is secondary. The day after the military police who were defending Nanshi retreated on orders, the rice shops in the concessions suddenly closed their doors, saying their "rice reserves were sold out." We'll temporarily ignore whether it's a fact or a disguised form of "hoarding for profit," but it's a major, fatal blow to these refugees crammed into the concessions. As for those waiting to die in the refugee area, it's even more tear-inducing!

The vegetable problem is naturally equally serious. Yesterday morning, I made a special trip to inspect a small vegetable market. There were many housewives holding vegetable baskets, wandering among the crowds. They didn't know how to allocate the few coins they had in their bags and finally went back with empty baskets. At a radish stall, a middle-aged man picked out four radishes with trembling fingers, but when the vegetable vendor told him it would cost one thousand cash, he stood there dumbfounded, like a prisoner being sentenced to death in court, unable to haggle for a long time. He looked like a primary school teacher. How could this "poor" job allow him to support his family now? Who doesn't have parents, who doesn't have a wife? I dare not imagine what kind of suffering these lives will endure in the future.

But who is to blame?

After leaving the small vegetable market, I went to inspect a few larger rice shops. At the rice shops on Zhengjia Muqiao, Baxianqiao, Caishi Road, and Route Lafayette, people were crowded like a tide. Some had iron wire fences in front of the doors, with concession police guarding the entrances and exits on both sides. The crowd was then arranged into lines, buying in order. These people all held a tin bucket or a bundle in their hands, fumbling for a folded banknote, slowly handing it to the rice clerk, and how many days could this little bit of rice they got last them?

Coming back home, it felt like a heavy weight was pressing on my heart. Aren't I also suffering the same fate?
