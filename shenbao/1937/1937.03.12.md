### Kodama and Others Go to Kobe

Scheduled to come to Shanghai by boat today. Issues a statement before departure.

[Tokyo] Mr. Kodama, the former president of Yokohama Specie Bank, the current chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association, and the leader of the economic inspection group to China, left here for Kobe today. He will depart with the members of the delegation on the Nagasaki Maru tomorrow. Before his departure, Kodama stated that he would do his best to seek rapprochement between China and Japan on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and respect for China's territorial sovereignty. He and the delegation members are now going to China to attend the first conference of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association established in Shanghai last year. They will take this opportunity to investigate China's economic and financial recovery efforts and frankly exchange views with Chinese leaders. He regretted that the peoples of China and Japan have developed resentment due to various political issues in recent years. He believed that the very close nature of Sino-Japanese relations often easily leads to political and economic friction. However, the two major powers in the Far East should adopt a long-term vision for the overall situation and find a way to resolve the current difficulties in order to restore friendly relations. If the two countries promote mutual understanding and maintain it, the situation can be easily resolved. (Eleventh dispatch from Reuters via the Central News Agency)

[Tokyo] The Japanese economic inspection group to China will depart from Kobe for Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru on the 12th. The head of the group, Kenji Kodama, left Tokyo for Kobe at 11 a.m. this morning. Kodama made the following statement before his departure: The Sino-Japanese Trade Association was established by industrialists from China and Japan the year before last. When its first conference is held in Shanghai this time, the Chinese side sent a letter notifying and inviting Japanese representatives to attend. Therefore, the Japanese side decided to gladly attend the conference. We intend to take this opportunity to inspect the financial and economic conditions that China and Korea are working hard to build, and at the same time, exchange opinions with the influential people of the other party on various issues as much as possible. Sino-Japanese relations have been unclear due to various political issues that have occurred in recent years, and the national sentiments of the two countries tend to be opposed to each other, which is a pity for us. However, because the relations between the two countries are extremely close in all respects, friction naturally occurs in politics and economics. The two countries of China and Japan should stand on the overall situation of East Asia and strive for cooperation and harmony in order to get rid of the state that is not improving as soon as possible, and at the same time guide the relations between the two countries to friendship and stability. As for the issue of economic cooperation, various opinions are advocated in all aspects, but its realization should take the harmony of national sentiments as a prerequisite. Under the current state of opposition, although full cooperation is desired, such an antagonistic relationship between the two countries cannot be allowed to continue. There is no other way than mutual understanding and efforts to open up the difficult situation on both sides. Although there have been various difficulties in political and economic issues from the beginning, if we consider each other in the above-mentioned spirit, we will still find a solution. According to my belief, the two countries should stand on the principle of respecting territorial sovereignty, mutual benefit and equality, and improve the national relations between the two countries, and we are already aware of the efforts to achieve this goal. (Eleventh dispatch from the Allied News Agency)

[Nanjing] The Japanese economic inspection group led by Kenji Kodama will arrive in Beijing on the 15th.

### Optimism Not Warranted Regarding Japan's New Diplomatic Policy

[Tianjin] According to reliable sources, Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi, in view of the failure of Hirota's past policies towards China, has specifically touted the slogan of improving Sino-Japanese relations in order to change international perceptions. In reality, his policy towards China is merely changing from being radical to being gradual. Issues such as eastern Hebei, northern Chahar, and Mongolia are already established facts and must be maintained in their current state. The military headquarters stationed in China intends to quietly observe its progress before making any statement. It would be a big mistake to think that the Japanese side's attitude is moderate.

### Important Notice for Group Visits to the Jade Art Preview Exhibition

Since the opening of this exhibition, we have received enthusiastic support from all sectors. In recent days, group visits have been unusually crowded.

(2) Group visit times are limited to 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

Our association will arrange the date and time according to the order of registration and send a reply letter. We will not receive those who arrive early or late.

(4) Individual visits are not limited by time.

The above measures are for the convenience of both parties. We hope that all sectors will understand and appreciate our good intentions.

### Fire in the Great China Market in Beijing Causes Losses of Up to One Million Yuan

The Entire Bazaar Was Completely Destroyed. The Extent of the Disaster Is Unprecedented.

[Nanjing] A fire broke out in the Great China Market on Taiping Road in Beijing at 3:50 a.m. on the 11th. At that time, the morning wind was strong, and the fire spread extremely quickly. All sixteen buildings of the bazaar and the twenty-one adjacent rooms in Zhongyi Square were destroyed. Although the fire brigades fought hard to put out the fire, the wind was too strong and the goods in the shops were mostly flammable, making it impossible to extinguish the fire immediately. The fire was brought under control at 8:40 a.m., but the embers reignited once at 10 a.m. and noon. Fortunately, measures were taken to extinguish the fire, preventing a major disaster. There are currently no accurate statistics on the losses, but it is said to be more than one million yuan, of which more than 400,000 yuan is insured.

### The Legislative Yuan Postpones Approval of the Forced Labor Convention

Incompatible with Current National Conditions

[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 12th was brought forward to the morning of the 11th due to the anniversary of the passing of the Premier, a customary day of rest and remembrance. Sixty-eight members, including Shi Weihuan, attended, with Sun Ke presiding and Liang Hancao as secretary-general. The draft of the Forced Labor Convention was passed according to the review report from the Foreign Affairs and Labor Law committees, but its approval was postponed. The convention, consisting of thirty-two articles, aims to abolish forced labor, a commendable intention. However, given China's recent practice of conscripting labor for service, the convention's second article stipulates that forced labor does not include military service, civic obligations, court rulings, or labor for unexpected national events. Furthermore, its tenth article stipulates the gradual abolition of forced labor requisitioned by administrative officials for public works. This is clearly incompatible with China's current national conditions. Moreover, articles eleven, fourteen, and seventeen concerning age and physical requirements, wage payments, and sanitation provisions for those in service are particularly difficult to fully implement under China's current circumstances. Therefore, it was resolved to postpone the convention's approval. (Eleventh-day Central News Agency telegram)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Commemorating the Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death

— Du

Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Nationalist Party, left the hustle and bustle of the world and departed from his guests. Twelve years have swiftly passed. The entire nation holds him in their hearts with sorrow. Every year on the anniversary of his death, there is a memorial ceremony. This is to remember this great leader and to silently contemplate his immense influence. Dr. Sun devoted his life to revolution and to upholding the teachings of the world. His goal was to bring the nation to a state of independence and liberation and to allow the people to enjoy the rights of freedom and equality. This burning desire is understood by both China and foreign countries. Unfortunately, his ambitions were not fully realized, and he prematurely passed away as a sage. On the eve of his death, he continued to emphasize the importance of fulfilling his principles and encourage his comrades to work hard, leading the masses as if he were still in office. His influence has been profound and universal. To this day, Dr. Sun's writings, such as the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" and "The Three Principles of the People," are deeply imprinted in the minds of the people and will never be erased. His last words are recited by every household and are deeply familiar. In just twelve short years, his influence has spread so widely. If Dr. Sun were aware, he would surely be delighted.

Furthermore, the reason why the Chinese people respect Dr. Sun Yat-sen lies in their commitment to the essence of his principles, which is by no means mere lip service. The reason why contemporary scholars promote Dr. Sun's legacy is based on the principle of practicing what you preach, not just transmitting it verbally. Therefore, after respectfully reading his will and silently mourning, everyone must sincerely and thoughtfully reflect on themselves. Does one's personal will contradict the direction indicated by Dr. Sun? Do one's actions, political measures, contradict the legacy of equality and freedom? Has civil rights been expanded? Has people's livelihood been improved? These are all materials for reflection, and one should seek answers to them. This applies not only to oneself but also to others. Seek out flaws and ask questions to ensure rigor and thoroughness, striving to avoid shame and regret. If the results of the examination can largely align with his teachings, then one can feel relieved. If there are areas that cannot be fulfilled, one should also seek the root cause and strive to improve with doubled effort, so that both body and mind can find peace. Then today's commemoration will have a more profound meaning.

In recent years, the country has been in turmoil, and the pressure has been increasing day by day. Foreign insults have been rampant, and everyone is afraid of being subjugated. Not only is national liberation still far away, but even seeking temporary peace is unattainable. This is, of course, something that all members of the Party and the country should deeply regret and feel ashamed of in the face of the Premier. Fortunately, those in charge are working hard to unite and do not shy away from gradual progress and eliminating crises. After the recent Third Plenary Session, the entire nation has taken a unified step, which is becoming increasingly evident. The National Assembly is scheduled to be convened, and a united struggle is emerging. All of this is a gradual attempt to embody Dr. Sun's legacy and promote it. It is hoped that this grand principle will be further enhanced to realize the Premier's wishes in the shortest possible time. May his spirit in heaven watch over us.

### Japanese House of Representatives' Emergency Debate on Diplomacy

Sato Says Key to Turning Crisis into Safety Lies in Japan's Ability to Change its Mind, Receives Enthusiastic Applause from Members

[Tokyo] Today's plenary session of the House of Representatives was particularly crowded due to the Democratic and People's parties raising urgent questions about diplomacy. Even the gallery had no room to stand, a scene rarely seen before. The meeting began at 1:34 PM. After continuing to question the government on the National Health Insurance Law, the Public Health Ministry Law, and the revised Tuberculosis Prevention Law, Minseito's Yusuke Tsurumi raised urgent questions about diplomacy as follows:

I would like to ask Foreign Minister Sato for his views on the fundamental principles of our country's diplomacy.

Europe is currently engulfed in a wave of enormous arms expansion. Even the British Labour Party has abandoned its long-held principles and endorsed the strengthening of national defense. I am asking about the impact of this European defense craze on our country, the crisis of war breaking out. How should the Foreign Minister consider this? If an unfortunate event were to occur, what attitude should our country take? If the Japanese Empire does not want to be drawn into the European turmoil, what fundamental diplomatic policy should it adopt? I believe that thoroughly maintaining peace in East Asia and remaining aloof from the chaos should always be a fundamental policy. What does the Foreign Minister think? I would also like the Foreign Minister to clearly state his views on the following six points regarding our country's current diplomacy:

㊀ First is the issue of secret diplomacy. For example, the Japan-Germany Agreement. Our people are still unaware of it, but the world already considers it a major issue. Our country has failed to criticize it, and the government has no way to maintain it.

㊁ Regarding the implementation of the Japan-Germany Agreement, the people also do not know its essence. Foreign countries consider it a political agreement. In the future, you should use appropriate methods to explain these key points.

㊂ Regarding clarifying Japan-Soviet relations, what specific measures are in place to resolve the Manchurian-Soviet border issue?

㊃ What are the specific guidelines for Anglo-Japanese friendship? Although the government advocates Anglo-Japanese friendship, Japanese goods are being widely rejected in various parts of Britain. The Japan-India and Japan-Australia agreements have been provisionally established, but they are not yet satisfactory.

㊄ Regarding the future of Japan-U.S. relations, the practical issue is often the naval disarmament plan. This is actually a two-country problem centered on China. The U.S.'s policy towards China has historically been purely economic, but since the Washington Treaty, it has become a political policy. Recently, a naval disarmament issue has arisen between the two countries, and the U.S.'s recent policy has reverted to an economic policy. Therefore, there should be no conflict between Japan and the U.S. What does the Foreign Minister think?

㊅ Finally, there is the China policy. Does the Foreign Minister have the intention to cooperate with China and other countries to open up Sino-Japanese relations? Japan should take the lead in discussing China's revision of tariffs. This is not only beneficial to China, but also beneficial to Japan. What does the Foreign Minister think? Secondly, there is the issue of investment in China. What opinions does the Foreign Minister hold? The Foreign Minister stated in the House of Peers that Sino-Japanese negotiations should be conducted from a standpoint of confrontation. I am afraid that this statement may lead to misunderstandings. (At this time, loud applause arose.) The unification and prosperity of China should be desired by the Japanese people. Please see this clearly. Our country's true intentions have often been mistakenly conveyed. Are we being deceived by them? We are very concerned about this.

I would like to ask the Foreign Minister for his views on the above matters.

Next, Hitoshi Ashida of the Seiyukai asked the following questions:

Foreign Minister Sato boldly expressed his policies in the House of Peers and received a good response. However, we believe that what he said was abstract and failed to reveal its specific content, which is quite regrettable. He only said that the three parties should work together in a satisfactory manner. We have heard such sweet words at every session of the Diet, but we still experience the extreme bitterness of reality. I would now like to ask the following questions:

㊀ How will the coordination between military preparations and diplomacy be handled? Regarding national defense, finance, and diplomacy, does the government have a comprehensive national policy? Some people believe that Japan is currently isolated, with China and the Soviet Union as hypothetical enemies and the U.S. and Britain as targets at sea, so it is necessary to build up the navy. The army and navy authorities currently have no intention of increasing military spending. Such statements are extremely short-sighted. We will encounter even greater military expenses. We ask the diplomatic authorities to be a major pillar of broad national defense. We still hope that the government will frankly state its views.

㊁ The Soviet diplomacy is a major issue for our country. However, there is neither assistance nor war between the two countries. In this current situation, what will happen? It can be inferred that the central issue in Japan-Soviet relations is not the propaganda of communism. If communism is the central issue, our country will be drawn into the whirlpool of ideological groups and face enormous disaster. Should Japan-Soviet relations proceed by separating themselves from the communist propaganda aspect?

㊂ Regarding the improvement of the China policy, it should start by clarifying the boundaries of the continental policy. Where should Japan stop? As long as this threat persists, how can friendship between the two countries be hoped for? Before economic cooperation, it is necessary to sweep away the atmosphere of political unease. I believe that realizing the unification of diplomacy is absolutely necessary. What does the Foreign Minister think?

㊃ The fundamental basis of diplomatic policy should be explained. At this time, if it gives the impression of territorial aggression, it will be absolutely unacceptable to the national spirit. Now we should raise the banner of free trade and engage with the world in peace. I hope that the Foreign Minister will give a clear answer. Foreign Minister Sato took the stage to answer:

Whether Europe will erupt into a major crisis. I believe that war will not break out so simply. There are both elements that lead to war and elements that oppose it. This is the power of public opinion. We currently have no need to create an economic bloc. The purpose of the Japan-Germany Agreement is to prevent communism, not to join the Fascist front. Therefore, it will not cause a rift in friendly relations with other countries, but it can be considered a temporary misunderstanding. Our country will not be drawn into the European turmoil because of this agreement. Our country should respect the independence of China and Mongolia. Japan's diplomatic policy can be open and have nothing to be ashamed of. We should also establish clear relations with British diplomacy. The foundation of Sino-Japanese relations must be based on equality in handling negotiations. This is just stating the most fundamental basis in ordinary terms. The China policy should be fair. If you want to stipulate the minimum limits, there should be no hesitation. Viewed from the perspective of various countries, there should be no doubts. China must also think the same way.

Regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Third International, what I said is that the world believes that the Third International will separate from the Soviet Union in a hundred years. There is such criticism. Although this is a natural criticism, I believe that the Third International is a special organization that will continue to exist. Therefore, our country cannot but take special measures. Since Japan and the Soviet Union share a border, various problems arise. The Japan-Germany Agreement is also a natural occurrence. If the two countries treat each other with sincerity, it will not be difficult to reach coordination.

I believe that what China is worried about and what we advocate should be to conduct negotiations on the basis of mutual disclosure and full understanding. The word "crisis" means that international relations are tense, which is a common situation for all countries, not just Japan's crisis. Therefore, there is no need to panic. The people of Japan should remain calm and not be impatient. Whether we should go to war when faced with a crisis should be considered by Japan itself. (Applause) If Japan has this consideration, then the crisis can be avoided. (At this time, there was a great round of applause.) The answer was completed, and the meeting adjourned at 7:35 PM.

### Roosevelt's Judicial Reform Bill

Senate Begins Review

[Washington] The Senate Judiciary Committee began reviewing President Roosevelt's proposed judicial reform bill today. This bill is of general public concern, so the committee held an open meeting today. A large number of people attended. The first speaker was Attorney General Cummings, who said that this bill is necessary and that adopting legislative procedures to reform the judicial system without proposing constitutional amendments is the most appropriate method. Next, Senator Borah spoke, criticizing the proposal to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, saying that the Supreme Court only needs a majority of one vote to invalidate laws, which has no bearing on whether the number of justices is increased or not. Subsequently, several senators spoke, discussing whether constitutional amendment procedures could be adopted for judicial reform measures. However, Cummings believed that constitutional amendments would only take effect after being passed by the legislatures of the forty-eight states, which would take too much time and would not be feasible. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas dispatch)

[Washington] The White House secretary stated today that President Roosevelt has received 500 letters and telegrams since his broadcast speech yesterday, of which three-quarters support the President's position. (10th, National Dispatch)

[Washington] Senator O'Mahoney announced today that he is preparing to propose an amendment to the Constitution, stipulating that a Supreme Court ruling that legislation by the federal or state legislatures is unconstitutional must be approved by at least two-thirds of the justices. O'Mahoney said that with forty-two state legislatures currently in session, this amendment has a good chance of being ratified by the states. (10th, National Dispatch) The Howard newspaper chain in New York today published an editorial stating that President Roosevelt's broadcast speech was "stubbornly insisting on his own views, lightly skipping over the method of amending the Constitution, and not even mentioning other proposals." The newspaper chain believes that if Supreme Court rulings require a two-thirds majority, their validity would be more lasting and could be implemented immediately. (10th, National Dispatch)

[New York] Philippine President Quezon told a New York Times Washington correspondent today that the Philippines should be granted independence immediately, without waiting until 1945, in order to develop the Philippines' economic strength.

According to the current Independence Act, the U.S. President has the power to veto laws passed by the Philippine legislature, and the United States has changed some provisions of the Act, increasing tariffs on Philippine goods, causing Filipinos to fear further changes in the future.

### Spanish Rebel Forces Approach Northeast Barrier of Capital

Advancing Twenty-Five Miles in Three Days; Loyalist Government Forces Repel Rebel Forces

◎ Soria: Nationalist forces advancing from northeast of Madrid are currently moving rapidly, having reached [Guadalajara], about nine miles from the key military stronghold (thirty-two miles from the capital). The terrain in that area is flat, so mechanized troops and cavalry are able to advance directly. Another column advancing from the east was twelve miles from Guadalajara last night, and another two miles would bring their destination within artillery range. The Nationalist headquarters is confident that Guadalajara will fall within days, cutting off Madrid's communications with the eastern coast. As a result of fierce fighting on the third day of the Nationalist offensive, they advanced a total of twenty-five miles on a front spanning nine to twelve miles from Secun柴. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters dispatch)

◎ Madrid: 30,000 Nationalist troops, aided by tanks, armored vehicles, and airplanes, are currently advancing on Guadalajara. Government forces have been mobilized to respond. According to Nationalist sources, their vanguard has advanced to within fifteen miles of Guadalajara. If the city falls, the Nationalist forces northeast and southeast of Madrid will be only about twenty-eight miles apart. General Miaja, the highest commander of the government forces in central Spain, is personally inspecting the northeastern front. According to government forces, the defenses of that front have been completed. (Central News Agency, 10th, Reuters dispatch)

◎ Madrid: In view of the rebel forces' tank columns directly attacking Guadalajara and sweeping all before them, the government forces today mobilized 100,000 new recruits to reinforce the capital's defenses. Officials said that the current rebel offensive from the northeast is spearheaded by two Italian divisions, totaling 14,000 men, divided into twenty teams, with a very long front. Reportedly, their "bald-headed" troops have reached twenty miles northeast of Guadalajara. Judging from the situation, rebel leader General Franco has exerted all his strength this time, determined to win. At the same time, the artillery fire bombarding Madrid has not ceased. The government forces today conscripted new recruits to defend Madrid from the classes of 1932 to 1936, requiring them to report within twenty-four hours and immediately depart for the front lines. (10th, National Dispatch)

◎ Madrid: After four days and nights of fierce fighting, government forces were forced to retreat to the Taguna Valley today. Although attacked by artillery and tanks, government forces were able to hold the line and defend the capital. Nationalist forces near the Brijica site were also ambushed by government forces, resulting in the capture of hundreds. However, on the Xueqin gate front, Nationalist forces also broke through the government forces' lines. According to Italian prisoner Pu Laixue Du's confession to government forces' leaders, there were no Spaniards in the Guadalajara Nationalist forces. All the artillerymen in that area were Germans. The Italian prisoner also said that he and 5,000 other Italians arrived in Spain on the Lombardy transport ship. (11th, National Dispatch)

◎ Madrid: Nationalist forces resumed their fierce attack on the northern city of Oviedo, bombarding the government forces' positions on Mount Bando and Fuluja with artillery for three hours, followed by a frontal assault. The militiamen in the government forces waited for the enemy troops to advance within 300 yards before engaging them, repelling them. According to news from Gijón, Asturian miners jumped out of the trenches during the battle, throwing bombs and grenades at the enemy, and placing explosives in the enemy's path. The enemy troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated, followed by two hours of artillery fire. The Nationalist infantry then charged the government forces' trenches twice, but each time they suffered casualties and retreated. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters dispatch)

### Spanish Foreign Minister Lodges Strong Protest with Germany and Italy

Alleging German and Italian Troops Participating in the Spanish War

◎ Valencia: Spanish Foreign Minister Vayuti has lodged a strong protest with the governments of Germany and Italy because German and Italian troops are participating in the Spanish war. The document quotes four Italian prisoners as saying that their troops, numbering 5,000, landed in Cadiz on February 1 and belonged to the Second Division of the Fascist Militia under the command of General Boqi. On March 8, they arrived in Secun柴, where there were six battalions of Italian troops on the front lines. They saw fifteen Italian cannons and German artillery units. At the same time, news from Algeciras stated that British travelers arriving there from Cadiz claimed that three ships, now believed to be Italian, unloaded Italian troops at the port at the end of the week. All three ships were unflagged, and their names had been painted over. According to the same source, the German warship Deutschland also unloaded a batch of goods in Algeciras recently, which many believe to be cannons and bullets.

### Mussolini Travels to North Africa

For Highway Inauguration Ceremony

◎ Port of Gaeta, Italy: Prime Minister Mussolini arrived here by car from Rome at 3:00 PM today. At 4:15 PM, amidst cheers from the crowd at the port, he boarded the cruiser "Pola" and set sail for the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa at 5:15 PM. Warships of the First Fleet, including the cruisers "Zara," "Gorizia," and "Fiume," also sailed with him. Colonial Minister Lessona, Propaganda Minister Alfieri, and Fascist Party Army Chief of Staff General Rosso also traveled on the "Pola" with the Prime Minister. A group including Vice Minister of the Army Barriani departed on the "Fiume." The Prime Minister previously visited North Africa in 1926, and this is his second inspection tour. He is scheduled to arrive at the port of Tobruk in Libya on the 12th of this month. A newly built coastal highway in Libya, stretching 1,900 kilometers from the Egyptian border in the east to the Tunisian border in the west, has been completed and will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister. The Italian Navy will also hold exercises along the North African coast, which will be personally inspected by the Prime Minister. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas dispatch)

[London] British naval and other circles are very concerned about Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's trip to Libya to observe large-scale Italian fleet exercises. The general opinion is that Mussolini is eager to test his strength in time, in case Italy wants to gain control of the Mediterranean one day. Londoners firmly believe that the Italian fleet's exercises will reflect the Italian fleet's ability to carry out Mussolini's recent bold words, that is, to seal off the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to the Suez Canal when necessary in the future. The location of the exercises is in the "waist" of the Mediterranean, "where the Sicilian coast is less than 100 miles from the African coast, which is of great significance, because at that location, not only the navy but also the air force can prevent enemy ships from sailing in the Mediterranean. British naval experts have always believed that airplanes are not a naval threat to the vast sea, but in this relatively narrow strait, such as Italy and its North African territories, separated by only a strip of water, airplanes are a real danger. Mussolini's other purpose in going to Libya is to inaugurate a new 15,000-mile highway, which was built for military purposes, between French Tunisia and Egypt, which is also a sign of Italy's attempt to seize hegemony in the Mediterranean. (Special dispatch from the Zilinbao, 11th)

[Moscow] The Pravda commented on Mussolini's tour of Libya, saying, "Mussolini's trip, in addition to demonstrating military power, is also political propaganda to pay attention to people's livelihood." This propaganda is necessary internally because famine and cold are rampant in the country, finances are extremely tight, and taxes are increasing day by day.

"The decisions of the recent Fascist Supreme Council and Mussolini's demonstration tour are not only to prepare for war, but also to pressure Britain and France to make concessions.

The purpose is to create possible conditions for negotiations because both Germany and Italy are in urgent need of loans and credit. The plans widely promoted by the Italian Fascists, although reiterated by the Fascist Supreme Council, have actually failed. Italy, like Germany, must import not only raw materials but also food."

The newspaper finally pointed out that "the coup planned in Hungary this time was organized by Hitler's party members and directly harmed Italian interests. This coup has obviously reduced the market value of Mussolini's shares. This coup and the recent German-Austrian negotiations prove that the Italian-German 'friendship' is extremely costly for Italy. Italy's foreign exchange has become increasingly dependent on Germany." (10th, Tass dispatch)

### Soviet Anti-Religious Movement

About to End

[Moscow] According to the declaration published today, the Soviet anti-religious movement, from a statistical point of view, is about to end. The number of members of the Soviet Anti-Religious League was 5 million in 1933, but is now less than 2 million. Other anti-religious organizations are also disintegrating. The Education Committee has closed five anti-religious museums in various provinces and shut down an important anti-religious organization with 3,000 members. On the church side, with religious freedom guaranteed by the new constitution, there is a thriving phenomenon. (Central News Agency, 10th, Reuters dispatch)

### British House of Commons Discusses Spanish Supervision Plan

Second Reading Passed by the House of Lords; Amended Commercial Navigation Act

[London] The British Amended Commercial Navigation Act bill was unanimously passed on its second reading in the House of Lords today. Foreign Undersecretary and Chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, Plymouth, introduced the bill at the second reading, which was greeted with unanimous cheers because the bill will enable international supervision of the Spanish border. Plymouth said that the passage of this bill was somewhat late, with many dangers, and feared that the hard-won results would also lead to unfortunate changes. He also said that in the future, if international inspectors discover that British ships have violated international agreements, they can report directly to the British Board of Trade for disposal. Furthermore, the inspecting vessels and the inspectors on board are not of the same nationality. Each inspecting vessel carries at least two inspectors. The Non-Intervention Committee did not discuss the question of whether neutral country inspectors should be stationed on warships. Plymouth also discussed the matter of the British mail ship Llandovery Castle hitting a mine two miles outside the port of Cruz in Spain on February 28. He said that the British ambassador had been instructed to lodge a protest with the Nationalist side because the Nationalist authorities had previously issued a warning that mines would be laid near the entrances to Spanish seaports. However, the location where the British ship was bombed was not near the entrance to a seaport, and the British government had not received prior notice of the laying of mines in the waters there. Plymouth also said that two days ago, the British ship Springwell was intercepted by a Nationalist fishing boat in the Strait of Gibraltar. The fishing boat ordered the British ship to sail to the port of Ceuta, but the British ship's captain did not obey the order. Plymouth said that the British government will also protest against this kind of interference with navigation. Plymouth also said that the government intends to invite the British Commonwealth countries and the United States to cooperate with the countries adhering to the non-intervention agreement. At the same time, the issue of Spanish non-intervention is also being discussed in the House of Commons. Foreign Secretary Eden said that the area defended by British warships is the northern coast of Spain from the Franco-Spanish border to Cape Busto, and the southern coast of Spain from the Spanish-Portuguese border to Cape Trafalgar. Although the responsibility of British warships in Spanish waters has greatly increased, the naval authorities will communicate with the government's consulates in Valencia, Barcelona, and Palma at any time. Eden also detailed the various conveniences that Portugal has given to British inspectors in the Portuguese-Spanish border in the new Anglo-Portuguese agreement. Eden said that the task of the British inspectors is to register the types of goods on board and the number and nationality of passengers, and report to the British ambassador to Portugal. British inspectors may also inquire with local authorities at any time about the entry and exit of goods and passengers, and request their assistance to prevent acts that violate the agreement. Furthermore, the place where surveillance is exercised is the Spanish border, whether at traffic transit points, especially at railway stations, and on roads of all sizes. The places where inspectors are located must be able to accurately ascertain that the non-intervention agreement can be observed by all countries. Eden also said that the British Ambassador in Andai has been instructed to lodge a protest with the Salamanca Nationalist authorities regarding the interference with British property at sea. Recently, two British ships, loaded with iron ore, were intercepted at sea by Nationalist warships. The British ambassador will demand the release of the goods, and the British government reserves the right to demand compensation for losses. (Central News Agency, 10th, Reuters dispatch)

### League of Nations Continues to Discuss Raw Materials Issue

Establishes Three Subcommittees

[Geneva] The Raw Materials Problems Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council continued its general debate this afternoon. First, Soviet representative Rosenblum (Director of the Commercial Treaty Department of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs) spoke, saying that since the views of the indigenous people of the colonies have not been sought on the issue of colonies, the Soviet Union cannot participate in the discussion. However, the Soviet Union is willing to participate in cooperation on the issue of improving the international market. Next, Canadian representative Reeves spoke, explaining that the sale of raw materials is more difficult than the purchase of raw materials. Then, Swedish representative Heilbrun, Mexican representative Robles, and Portuguese representative Fernandes successively expressed their opinions. At this point, the general debate was declared closed. The Committee then passed a proposal by the Chairman, Swiss representative Sterki, to establish three subcommittees as follows: The first subcommittee is responsible for drafting a statistical outline, with South African representative Stracosh, American representative Grady, and Dutch representative Hogepont serving as members, and cooperating with the Director of the Financial and Economic Section of the League of Nations Secretariat, Rofte. The second subcommittee will review the current laws of raw material producing countries, as well as other factors that may affect other countries' purchase of raw materials. The third subcommittee will study the reasons why some importing countries cannot use their raw material stocks. In addition, Chairman Sterki stated that the Raw Materials Problems Committee should limit its research to the issue of raw material distribution, and the issue of colonial transfer is not within the scope of the Committee's authority. This was unanimously agreed upon by the Committee. In addition, the Committee also agreed that statistics should be compiled for both food and industrial products for reference, and that the scope of research should not be limited to raw materials produced in colonies, but also include raw materials produced in the home countries of all countries.

### French National Defense Loan Bill Passed by Both Houses of Parliament

Article Stipulates Total Amount of Public Debt Not to Exceed 105 Billion

[Paris] The Senate discussed the government's proposed national defense loan plan today, and as a result, approved it with an overwhelming majority of 258 votes to 1 vote, but with the addition of an article stipulating that the total amount of public debt should not exceed 105,000,000,000 francs. The bill was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies for reconsideration, where it was passed by a majority of 471 votes to 39 votes. As a result, the national defense loan bill has been established, and the bonds will be issued starting this Friday (the 12th of this month). During the Senate's discussion today, Prime Minister Blum gave a speech, applying to the Senate to cooperate with the government to enhance France's strength and security. He also said that after the issuance of the national defense loan, funds fleeing abroad can flow back to the country, foreign funds can inject into France, and the foreign exchange market can change its current trend. In addition, the general public can trust the Treasury's ability to pay debts, and there is hope that the financial situation will be improved. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, most senators, such as the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Cailleux, and Rapporteur Garde (both Radical Socialist Party members), successively spoke, all supporting the bill proposed by the government, and especially approving the government's decision to reduce expenditures by 6,000,000,000 francs. Right-wing Senator de Jardin proposed an amendment, requesting that a committee composed of parliamentarians from all parties be organized to supervise the use of national defense loans, but the Senate finally rejected it with 207 votes to 62 votes. Subsequently, the National Defense Loan Bill was voted on and passed. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas dispatch)

### Hungarian House Questions Right-Wing Conspiracy

Prime Minister Says Closely Watching

⊙ Hungary: The Hungarian government has stopped the plot of the united association of extreme right-wing groups to launch a coup. When the House of Representatives met yesterday, two members were about to raise a question to the government. Prime Minister Dalani then issued a declaration, saying, "It is the duty of the government to closely monitor domestic political movements, not to allow them to deviate from the norm, and to be harmful to peace and order, and to reassure public opinion, so that it firmly believes that the government will be able to fulfill its duties, and it will be no different in the future. However, if some people have impulsive situations, the government should not use them as an excuse and act rashly. As for foreigners wanting to directly gain influence in Hungary's political evolution, the government believes that there is no such thing, and if there is, it is only in an indirect way." (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas dispatch)

Vienna: Austrian monarchists were extremely uneasy after hearing about the Hungarian coup plot. The organ of the party, "Austrian People's Daily," expressed dissatisfaction with the Hungarian government's efforts to deny it, and said that the extreme right-wing actually had this kind of conspiracy, briefly stating, "The Hungarian politician group was subsidized by Germany, ordering them to seize power. If the Hungarian coup is completed, then the German group will be like a turtle in a jar." (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas dispatch)

### Bulgarian House to be Re-elected

⊙ Capital of Bulgaria: The House of Representatives has not been re-elected since its dissolution in May 1934. When Prime Minister Gusariev reorganized the cabinet for the second time in July last year, he promised to hold elections in October of that year. However, because of differing opinions on the issue of amending the election law, it has not been possible to fulfill his wish. Now the government has decided to hold elections in the near future to restore constitutional normalcy. Minister of Education Nilav gave a speech yesterday to start the election campaign, briefly stating that Bulgaria should obtain the right to reorganize its military equipment under the conditions permitted by its financial situation and within the scope of current international constraints. (According to the 1919 Treaty of Neuilly with Bulgaria, Bulgaria's army manpower shall not exceed 25,000, all warships shall be demolished, and no air force shall be established.)

### International Labor Federation Holds General Assembly

[Paris] The International Labor Federation, at the request of the French Communist Party, held a general assembly this morning to discuss the situation in Spain. The chairman was Sir Walter Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress. Approximately 300 representatives from twenty countries attended, including Léon Jouhaux, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor. Today's meeting heard a speech by the Spanish representative, who stated that his country originally had the right to purchase military supplies from abroad to quell rebellions. The non-intervention agreement established by various countries only added to the difficulties of the Republican government. However, if all countries could strictly maintain neutrality, the two sides in the Spanish Civil War could each rely on their own strength to determine victory or defeat, and there would be no disparities in support. The representative concluded by stating that foreigners serving in the government army were purely volunteers, while those from Germany and Italy fighting for the rebels were members of their respective countries' regular armies. Although the two could not be compared on the same level, if the Adjustment Committee could facilitate the complete withdrawal of foreigners fighting in Spain, they were prepared to support it.

### Cangshi Railway Construction to be Realized

Chinese and Japanese Personnel Hold Successive Meetings in Tianjin; Construction Funds to be Borrowed from South Manchuria Railway Company

Tianjin Dispatch: Regarding the Cangshi Railway construction issue within the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Chinese and Japanese personnel have been meeting in Tianjin for days. However, to avoid external attention, each meeting is held at the North Ning Official Residence on Haihe Road in the Special District, between 4:00 and 5:00 PM, and always lasts until 8:00 or 9:00 PM at night. The first meeting was on March 5th, the second on the 6th, and the third on the 8th. The Chinese side attendees included Chen Juesheng, Zhou Qingman, Pan Yugui, Xu Ji, Yu Changfu, and more than ten others, all key members of the Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee. The Japanese side included Shindo Sohgawa, President of the China-Japan Industrial Development Company; Hiramaya Keizo, Director; Kiyono, Tianjin Branch Manager; Ota Masao, Director of the South Manchuria Railway Company Tianjin Office; Aruga Koji, Ping Office Director; Nonaka Tokio, Head of the Survey Section of the China-Japan Industrial Development Company; and more than ten technical experts. Except for Sohgawa, who went to Ping to inspect the Longyan Iron and Steel Plant in Tangshan, all other personnel participated in the third meeting on the 8th. The first two meetings focused on studying six items: 1. Loan methods; 2. Cost sharing; 3. Material supply; 4. Construction start date; 5. Technical assistance; and 6. Vehicle purchase. The third meeting focused on technical cooperation and actual construction implementation. Similar meetings will continue to be held to ensure the project is actively realized. It is reported that the concrete results of recent discussions regarding construction matters are: a specialized construction design committee will be established above the Engineering Bureau, and experts from the South Manchuria Railway Company will be hired as chief engineers to supervise all construction progress. The construction cost is 24 million to 28 million yuan, with interest rates of 5 to 6.5% per week, and the China-Japan Industrial Development Company is responsible for borrowing from the South Manchuria Railway Company. However, the South Manchuria Railway Company is concerned about being unable to pay such a large sum in cash, so it will use materials and vehicles as payment, and the hiring and treatment of technical personnel will also be included in the loan as payment. Therefore, the actual cash loaned out by the South Manchuria Railway Company may be between 8 million and 12 million yuan. Sohgawa is scheduled to return to Tianjin from Tangshan on the 10th to inspect the route, and then depart from Tianjin with Chinese and Japanese technical personnel, passing through Cang County and heading to Shijiazhuang. Currently, North China diplomacy is silent, and Japanese government and public are mostly focused on the economic development of North China. The military previously opposed the China-Japan Industrial Development Company handling everything alone. Now that the opinions of the Army, Foreign Affairs, and Development Ministries are gradually converging, they believe that carrying out Sino-Japanese economic cooperation through private cooperation can avoid the suspicion of military interference. Domestic financial groups also share this view, so the idea of assisting the China-Japan Industrial Development Company to take charge of the project has resurfaced. The Japanese side considers the construction of the Cangshi Railway as a vested interest. To prevent British and American investment, they are striving to take the lead and are determined to implement it. Although cash cannot be raised, they are trying to exhaust all their resources to achieve it. This is why the Tianjin meetings are being held repeatedly. After a few more meetings, everything can be finalized, and construction of the Cangshi Railway may begin in June or July of this year.

The Tanggu Transportation Company, operated by the Japan-China Industrial Development Company, has been making concrete preparations since Sohgawa came to Tianjin. The head office has been established on Haihe Road in the Tianjin Special District and will officially open on the first of next month, with a capital of 3 million yuan, of which 1 million yuan has already been paid up. Three barges have been prepared to operate between Dagu and Tanggu, specializing in transporting crude salt for export and transferring cargo to large ships. Future expansion will depend on business performance. Although the Tianjin Haihe barge companies harbor opposition, they are powerless due to environmental constraints and can only swallow their anger and watch the completion of others' businesses, awaiting the final command of fate.

### Contract Signed for Export of Crude Salt to Japan

First Batch of 100,000 Tons, Second Batch of 130,000 Tons; Value of Each Ton is Over 2.3 Yuan in National Currency

Tianjin to Shanghai Dispatch: Regarding the export of crude salt to Japan, Shindo Sohgawa, President of the Japan-China Industrial Development Company, came to Tianjin on the 26th of last month and repeatedly contacted the Crude Salt Transport Office and the Lufeng Store with Kiyono Jotaro, the company's Salt Industry Minister. Negotiations were finalized on the 9th of this month, and a draft contract was signed at the Changlu Transport Envoy Office at 3:00 PM on the 10th. Both parties submitted it to their respective governments for approval, and it can be implemented after approval. The matter dates back to December of last winter, and negotiations have been conducted dozens of times. Due to cost considerations, the salt pan households on our side were unwilling to sell, especially not to sell more than 200,000 tons in one batch. Later, the Japan-China Industrial Development Company used many strategies to make the pan households feel compelled by the environment to agree to their request, and they reluctantly agreed to sell 100,000 tons. However, the Japanese side insisted on no less than 200,000 to 250,000 tons. After repeated consultations, the number of purchases to be made by the Japanese side this year was finalized a few days before the draft contract was signed, divided into two batches. The first batch of 100,000 tons will be covered by one contract, and the salt stored in the Dagu and Denggu salt fields will be loaded first. On the other hand, the salt pan households will intensify their salt production. If there is any surplus, a second batch contract will be signed. The amount of the second batch will be limited to 130,000 tons. After both parties agreed, the signing ceremony was conducted on the afternoon of the 10th. The Japanese representatives were Hiramaya Keizo, Director of the China-Japan Industrial Development Company, and Kiyono Jotaro, Salt Industry Minister. The Chinese representatives were Li Hanhua, Changlu Transport Envoy; Li Menglu, Consultant of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee; Shao Jingyin, Manager of the Lufeng Store; and Xu Xianhang, Deputy Manager. The procedure was completed at about 4:00 PM. Li Menglu immediately returned to Ping to report to Li Sihao. It was found that the procedure for exporting crude salt to Japan this time was slightly different from last year's. The difference is that the contract this time does not include a subsidy of 20,000 yuan paid by the China-Japan Industrial Development Company to the salt pan households, in order to meet the price of 2.4 yuan per ton. The Japanese side stipulates that when the Tanggu Transportation Company is established on April 1st, the salt exported to Japan will be transported by several barges to the outer port of Dagu Gaizikou, where it will be transferred to ships dispatched by the two shipping companies, Dai Nippon and International, which specialize in transporting crude salt, and transported to Hokkaido Tokugawa, Asahi Glass, and Soda Companies in Japan to be used as chemical salt raw materials. As for the Changlu salt pan households, originally there were more than 200, but more than 100 have stopped production due to poor business in recent years. Now there are only more than 90 left. The large amount of salt exported has created a situation where supply cannot meet demand, so the closed pan households have decided to borrow 100,000 to 200,000 yuan from the Hebei Provincial Bank to resume drying. The Changlu Transport Envoy Office is currently assisting in the negotiations. The original text of the contract for exporting crude salt to Japan is as follows: "Draft Contract The Japan-China Industrial Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the buyer) of the Great Japanese Empire recognizes the Changlu Yuyan of the Lufeng Store (hereinafter referred to as the seller) of the Republic of China, for the purpose of exporting to Japan for industrial use, the following terms are agreed upon: Article 1 Name and Quality, Hangu Changlu residual salt shall be shipped in order from the oldest salt; Article 2 Quantity, The quantity is initially set at 100,000 metric tons for the year 26 of the Republic of China (Showa 12). The buyer shall have the freedom to increase or decrease by 5 percent; Article 3 Loss, Loss in transit shall be calculated at 96% of the actual salt shipped (96%), but tax shall be paid according to the actual tonnage shipped; Article 4 Price, The salt price for the year 26 of the Republic of China (Showa 12) is agreed to be 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 6 fen, 2 li and 2 hao in national currency per metric ton (each metric ton weighs 20 dan in city weight); Article 5 Shipping Deadline, The number stipulated in Article 2 of this contract shall be shipped from the beginning of March to the end of December as the shipping period, but if irresistible events occur during this period, so that the full number cannot be shipped, it may be extended to the next year when export is possible, but if the above situation does not occur, and the shipment cannot be completed within the deadline, the buyer shall be responsible for compensating the seller for the losses incurred; The shipping start time for this year shall be after the Tianjin Customs receives the official export order from the Ministry of Finance; Article 6 Place and Method of Delivery, For delivery to ocean-going vessels, all barging fees and other special losses from the salt mound to the ocean-going vessel shall be borne by the buyer; Article 7 Time and Method of Payment, After the Changlu Salt Affairs Audit Office issues the salt release permit, the buyer shall first pay half of the salt price according to the number of shipments of that ocean-going vessel, and the remaining unpaid half shall be paid in full immediately after loading is completed; Article 8 Unloading Certificate, After the salt-carrying vessel arrives at the Japanese port and finishes unloading, the buyer shall immediately request the Japanese government Monopoly Bureau to issue an unloading certificate and hand it over to the seller, but if the buyer fails to fulfill the aforementioned procedure to the seller, the buyer shall be responsible for compensating the seller for the losses incurred; Article 9 Term of Validity of this Contract, The term of validity of this draft contract shall be from the date of signing by both parties to the date of establishment of the formal contract; Article 10 Special Agreement, A The payment of the crude salt export tax and all procedures shall be handled by the seller, but the required expenses shall be borne by the buyer, B After the establishment of this contract, the seller shall not sell Changlu residual salt to anyone other than the buyer for shipment to Japan, and the buyer shall not order from anyone other than the seller in this salt pan. This draft contract shall be made into four formal contracts in Chinese and Japanese after being approved by the competent authorities of the two governments, and one copy shall be sent to each of the official departments of both parties, and one copy shall be held by the seller and the buyer as evidence. Buyer, Seller, Republic of China Year Month Day, Showa Year Month Day" (10th)

### Koreans Poison Wells in Jimo

Caught by the Tax Police Corps; Poisons Seized on the Spot

Qingdao Dispatch: Several Koreans, including Cui Shidi, etc., usually engaged in the business of trafficking in drugs in the vicinity of Qingdao, and colluded with Jin Shiyue of Chenggezhuang Village, Jimo County, to secretly smuggle and profit from drugs. From time to time, they put drugs such as red alum (i.e. arsenic) into wells in various villages, and the villagers who were harmed by them were countless. Tang Shixin, the battalion commander of the Independent Second Battalion of the Tax Police Corps, upon receiving a report, immediately sent instructor Wang Binhai and team leader Guo Jinling, along with several tax police, to search Jin Shiyue's home in Chenggezhuang Village. At that time, there were three Koreans inside. Seeing the tax police arrive, they knew things were not going well. Jin Shiyue immediately shot at Guo et al. with a box gun, and the tax police also fired back. Another Korean also wielded a knife. Fortunately, no one was injured on either side. As a result, two Koreans were captured on the spot. Jin Shiyue and the Korean with the knife escaped. One package of heroin, weighing 38 taels, and some red alum (this drug was used to poison villagers) were found in the house. After Guo et al. captured the Koreans, they were about to escort them to the battalion headquarters. When they left the village, they suddenly saw the Korean who had wielded the knife earlier coming towards them. The Korean was caught on the spot because he could not avoid it, and was escorted to the battalion headquarters for interrogation together. Battalion Commander Tang immediately interrogated them severely. The Koreans all confessed to trafficking drugs. After recording the confession, team leader Guo was dispatched with two policemen to escort the three Koreans by Jiaoji Railway car from Chengyang to Qingdao at 10:00 PM on the 8th. After getting off the car, they were sent to the Public Security Bureau. After the bureau interrogated them, it negotiated with the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao to severely punish them. On the 9th, the Koreans had already been taken away by the Japanese Consulate. The heroin, red alum, iron knife, etc. seized were all confiscated by the Public Security Bureau.

### Changshu

Wealthy Family Robbed in Pingshu

Pingshu Town in the Third District is very close to the lake area, and bandits can easily appear and disappear, so there are not many residents, and the defense is very empty. Xu Zhongkang, a resident of the town, is over sixty years old, has many children and grandchildren, and his family is quite wealthy. Unexpectedly, he was coveted by bandits. Eight or nine lake bandits suddenly came the other night, breaking into Xu's house from the back, carrying four box guns, and conducting a large-scale search. Zhong was not at home at the time. His son Zhengsheng and daughter-in-law Ge were both seized by the bandits, who forced them to ask where the silver was hidden and poured cold water into their noses up to five basins. As a result, cash and clothes worth about 1,000 yuan were robbed. The young Xu couple are still seriously injured.

They dragged Yang Guixiang out of his dream and used a pistol from one of the bandits to scare him into silence, forcing him to tell them where the foreign currency was hidden, and ransacked the boxes and cabinets at will. After half an hour, they left with the loot through the back door. Afterwards, they reported to the nearby police officer Ni Manfu to pursue the bandits, but the police officer concealed the report and allowed the bandits to escape far away. Police Chief Zhang Guannan was furious when he heard about it and immediately sent him to the County Police Bureau for interrogation on suspicion of harboring the bandits, and asked for punishment himself.

New Method for Promoting Kiln Products

The Kiln Industry Management Office is now working hard to promote sales. In addition to the five kiln industry cooperatives that have been established, two more are about to be established. However, the kiln owners occasionally have doubts about the office's sales, so many new methods have been formulated and announced to the whole county: 1 The local trade of each kiln owner will be sold through the cooperative, and will not go through the sales office. For Shanghai, Hangzhou, etc., the cooperative will set the minimum price. Only above the minimum price can it be sold. How much is sold, how much is paid to the kiln owner. The goods in each area are different, and the price is also set by each area; 2 The current kiln fire numbers of each kiln area are numbered. They will be sold according to the needs of the customers according to the number, and if there is not enough, they will be supplemented in order; 3 After the size of the mold is specified, a total brand name "Jiashan" will also be used for the brand name, so that it can be circulated everywhere in the kiln area of the county, abolishing private brand names to avoid competitive sales, squeezing, and hindering control. After the new method was announced, the kiln owners were very clear.

### Residents of Yugu Village in the Extra-Settlement Road Area Refuse to Donate

Shanghai Municipal Council Blocks Access Roads, Municipal Government Lodges Protest Yesterday, Secretary-General Yu Discusses Negotiation Process

According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession suddenly blocked the access roads of Yugu Village in the extra-settlement road area of ​​western Shanghai the night before last. Although negotiations have been ineffective, the situation is extremely serious. The details are as follows:

Access Roads Blocked: After most residents in the extra-settlement road area of ​​western Shanghai expressed their disagreement with the Shanghai Municipal Council's collection of police donations, they continued to refuse to pay despite the Council's urging. The Shanghai Municipal Council blocked all access roads to Yugu Village the night before last. The village is bordered by streets on three sides, all within the extra-settlement road area, and one side borders Yuyuan Road. There is one iron gate on the Yuyuan Road side, one iron gate on the Daxilu side, and nine iron gates on the Difeng Road side. The Shanghai Municipal Council filled each iron gate with wire mesh, with wooden barriers about three or four feet high outside the mesh, and wooden stakes were used to secure the wooden barriers. Chinese and foreign police officers were stationed in front of each iron gate.

Verbal Protest by the Municipal Government: After receiving the news, the Shanghai Municipal Government, in addition to Secretary-General Yu lodging a verbal protest with the Council authorities, also sent Wang Dasui, Director of the Supervisory Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, and Hong Qi, Chief of the Second Section, to inspect the area. The police station in charge temporarily dispatched additional police officers to maintain order in the village. Currently, in addition to two watchmen (one Chinese and one foreign) dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Council, there are also six police officers to provide protection.

Great Inconvenience to Residents: The village has more than a hundred houses, and most of the residents are wealthy and travel by car. However, since the iron gates were closed by the Shanghai Municipal Council, all cars staying in the village have been unable to leave, and those outside have been unable to enter. Residents can only rely on walking through the shops along Daxilu and Yuyuan Road, but this has already caused great inconvenience.

House Donations Already Paid: Central News Agency reporters inquired with residents of the village. Some residents have paid the police donations to the Shanghai Municipal Council as scheduled. Most of the shops along the street have paid the winter police station donations to the Shanghai Municipal Council, but the spring police donations have not been paid because the Shanghai Municipal Council has not sent collection personnel to collect them. The Shanghai Municipal Council's sudden closure of the iron gates was unexpected. However, since the houses were built in the Chinese area and police officers maintain order, the house donations should be paid to the Municipal Government.

Secretary-General Yu's Remarks: Central News Agency reporters made a special trip to the Municipal Government yesterday morning to meet with Secretary-General Yu, who explained the details of the case as follows: The problem of extra-settlement roads has been discussed by representatives of the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council for many years, and several temporary measures have been agreed upon. However, just when the case was about to be resolved, the Japanese side suddenly raised objections, creating complications and leading to a standstill. The details of this were reported in detail by Mr. Arnold, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, at last year's annual meeting of taxpayers. Recently, Mr. Arnold and Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, had a meeting with me. Both sides hoped to break through the difficulties and decided to find a way to resolve this long-standing case as soon as possible within a reasonable scope. However, just when the entire extra-settlement road problem was awaiting resolution, the incident occurred last night (ie, the night before last) where the Shanghai Municipal Council blocked the entrances and exits of the lanes in Yugu Village on Yuyuan Road because the tenants refused to pay house donations. This is deeply regrettable. After receiving the report, I immediately lodged a verbal protest with the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities at four o'clock in the morning and advised them to consider it carefully so as not to affect the resolution of the extra-settlement road problem. Although they replied at the time that they would consider it, they still did not remove the obstacles this morning (ie, yesterday morning), so negotiations have continued. At the same time, the Municipal Government authorities hope that the citizens living in the extra-settlement road area should also take a serious attitude towards the issue of paying house donations and should not act purely out of emotion, which would increase the difficulty of resolving the entire case. It should be known that the Shanghai Municipal Council's exercise of police power and collection of house donations in the extra-settlement road area have no legal basis. This kind of ultra vires measure will be abolished sooner or later. However, before the Municipal Government has fully recovered the police power in the extra-settlement road area and has not been able to lay ditches and sewers in this area during the transitional period, the residents in the extra-settlement road area enjoy the convenience of the Shanghai Municipal Council's ditches and sewers. According to the principle of obligation and rights, residents cannot but have some return. Before the Municipal Government resolves the extra-settlement road problem, if residents are unwilling to voluntarily pay the return money to the Shanghai Municipal Council, they should also hand it over to the Municipal Government, which will negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council in accordance with the situation in each area.

Opinion of a Certain Legal Expert: Central News Agency reporters also inquired with a certain legal expert about his opinion on this matter. According to him, the Shanghai Municipal Council's construction of roads outside the boundary has no legal basis and is in fact an infringement of sovereignty. It is even more illegal to collect taxes from residents outside the boundary. Now, blocking traffic because some residents refuse to pay illegal taxes is even more unreasonable. Now, considering the Shanghai Municipal Council's intention, it is blocking traffic because the residents there have not paid taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council, so as to prevent the residents there from walking on the streets built by the Shanghai Municipal Council. But just think, in the concession, are all pedestrians, whether driving or walking, taxpayers to the Shanghai Municipal Council? Of course, there is no such restriction. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot prohibit entry and exit because they do not pay police donations. Conversely, if our country's authorities also prohibit those who do not pay house donations to the Chinese government from entering and exiting, and use wire mesh or wooden barriers to block all places where the concession borders China, then how can the concession exist and how can it prosper? Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council's move this time, which is contrary to reason and common sense, should be seriously considered to avoid being ridiculed.

Citizens Hold Meeting: According to the New Voice Society, the 34th Branch of the Citizens' Association of the First Special District of this city has recently received reports from all residents of Yugu Village on Jing'an Temple Road, stating that the area is an extra-settlement construction. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly cut off the entrances and exits of the village's houses and stopped supplying tap water due to a dispute over the collection of house donations. All the tenants are very panicked and request negotiation to facilitate residence. After receiving the report, the association decided to convene an emergency meeting of all executive committee members today to discuss countermeasures and, if necessary, petition the Municipal Government.

### Thirty-Three Chinese Laborers Who Participated in the European War in France Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Unemployed for Many Years, Living in Extreme Hardship, Representatives to Petition for Relief in Nanjing Today

According to the New Voice Society, a large number of Chinese laborers who participated in the European War and were stranded in France. After Wang Jinxia, ​​a representative to the 19th National Labor Conference, returned to China, he contacted business and industry circles to request the government to find a way to repatriate them. When Zhu Xuefan attended the 20th Congress, he also contacted Consul General Lin and asked the French authorities to subsidize repatriation. These Chinese laborers have been in France for 20 years and are not familiar with Chinese.

Thirty-Three People: The thirty-three people who were repatriated this time are as follows: Zhang Zhenshan, Jiangsu, 50 years old; You Fuqi, Tianjin, 43 years old; Ding Huanzhang, Shandong, 49 years old; Wei Chaozeng, Shandong, 50 years old; Li Yanxi, Tianjin, 41 years old; Zhang Yunan, Shandong, 42 years old; Xu Zhende, Shandong, 49 years old; Chu Desheng, Shandong, 52 years old; Lü Defa, Shandong, 48 years old; Gao Fuyou, Shandong, 43 years old; Liu Fugui, Tianjin, 57 years old; Dong Laiguang, Shandong, 40 years old; Jie Rongxiang, Shandong, 46 years old; Yang Desheng, Anhui, 42 years old; Zhang Xiuhai, Anhui, 41 years old; Wang Yushan, Zhili, 46 years old; Luo Jinsheng, Henan, 43 years old; Xie Gui, Zhili, 51 years old; Xu Chen, Shandong, 56 years old; Lu Jinkui, Shandong, 44 years old; Zhang Changhua, Jiangsu, 49 years old; Jiang Yunxian, Henan, 43 years old; Jiang Lizhi, Shandong, 47 years old; Yang Zhengxiang, Hunan, 43 years old; Wang Yuanxin, Shandong, 47 years old; Wang Rencai, Zhili, 40 years old; Chen Zhifu, Shandong, 46 years old; Zhou Jingyuan, Shandong, 41 years old; Guo Yuanshan, Tianjin, 56 years old; Zhang Guilin, Zhili, 44 years old; Guo Xiangyou, Shandong, 46 years old; Chen Jiwen, Zhili, 52 years old; Liu Deshan, Jiangsu, 50 years old.

Returned to China Yesterday Afternoon: Luo Jinsheng and the other thirty-three people were subsidized for travel expenses by our Consul General Lin in France, with each person receiving 1,500 francs for the ship fare. Therefore, they returned to China on the French postal ship "Bernardin" on February 5. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 2:15 PM yesterday afternoon and berthed at the China Merchants Bureau's Zhongzhan Wharf. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, after receiving the report, ordered the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to send personnel to take care of them. The bureau immediately sent Mr. Tan Zhonglu to greet them at the wharf and find accommodation for them. According to Mr. Tan's statement to the New Voice Society reporter, the bureau decided to telegraph the central government to ask for instructions on how to handle the matter.

Petition in Nanjing: After arriving at the port, the overseas Chinese laborers went to their lodgings to rest. However, due to being unemployed for many years and having no savings, they face livelihood difficulties. Therefore, they decided to send representatives Wang Yushan, You Fuqi, and Ding Huanzhang to Nanjing this morning to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government's Executive Yuan, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting resettlement and relief.

Statements Released: According to the representatives You Fuqi and Ding Huanzhang, they told a New Voice Society reporter yesterday that they were dismissed by the factory authorities because they had no family or home in France. They have been unemployed for five or six years. Fortunately, they participated in the European War, so the French authorities gave them four francs per day after they became unemployed, which was just enough to make a living. This allowance was paid once every six days, and there was no allowance on Sundays and holidays. If they did not sign, the payment would be suspended for two days. During working hours, they could earn an average of 35 francs at most and 20 francs at least. However, after five years of unemployment, they have no private savings. They hope that the authorities can resettle them. It would be best if they could find work in the near future. Otherwise, they will return to their hometowns.

Relief Based on Certificates: The French authorities' living expenses for the Chinese laborers who participated in the war are based on the certificates and number plates issued during the war. The translation is as follows: The Chief of the Chinese Labor Affairs Section, Fifth Division, Eighth Department of the French Ministry of the Army, is issuing licenses. It is found that the Chinese laborer No. □ meets the qualifications limited by the law of June 23, 1920, establishing the French Commemorative Medal for the European War. A license is hereby issued as proof. Issued in Paris, the capital of France, on April 14, 1922.

### Giant Eurasian Aircraft Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Amid Strong Winds

Piloted by Three German Aviators, Eight Days of Flying En Route to China, Sino-German Air Navigation Successful Five Times

According to the New News Agency, the Eurasian Aviation Corporation, due to the development of passenger and postal services on various routes, has recently resumed flying the Ping-Guangzhou line, first the Ping-Hankou section, and plans to resume the entire line. All aircraft are in short supply, so according to previous methods, it continued to order two Junkers Type 52 three-engine giant aircraft from the German Lufthansa. The first of these, piloted by German aviator Rafiqi, mechanic Dubell, and radio operator Lanley, flew directly from Germany to China for delivery. It safely arrived at Longhua Airport at 2:00 PM yesterday. This is the fifth successful direct flight between China and Germany.

Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Eurasian Company received a telegram from the aircraft stating that it had flown to Shanghai from Hong Kong at 8:00 AM. It immediately notified people from all walks of life in China and Germany to go to Longhua Airport at 2:00 PM to welcome it. On the one hand, it also sent personnel to the airport to arrange everything. The welcome stand was set up inside the company's airport shed. The national flags of China and Germany and the Eurasian Company flag were hung from the roof. A large banquet table was placed in the shed, and flowers, champagne, and refreshments were displayed on the table to prepare for the welcome and entertain the guests. Those who arrived included Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasian Aviation Corporation, He En, Chief of the Aviation Group, Walter, representative of German Lufthansa in Shanghai, Stazzi, representative of Junkers Factory in China, Nornimo, Director of the Eastern Department of the German National Socialist Party, and staff from the German Consulate General, as well as dozens of Chinese and foreign guests.

Landing Situation: Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, Chinese and foreign guests arrived at the airport one after another. When the aircraft was spotted in the clouds east of the airport at 2:00 PM, it quickly flew over the airport. The sound of the engine shook the entire field. The welcomers took off their hats and waved their handkerchiefs or applauded to warmly welcome it. After circling in the air twice, it landed safely in front of the hangar at 2:15 PM. The welcomers rushed to the side of the aircraft. Before long, the door opened, and pilot Rafiqi, mechanic Dubell, and radio operator Lanley, all wearing black flight suits, got off the aircraft one after another. Miss Hertze, a German expatriate, presented flowers and took photos next to the aircraft. Then, led by Mr. Li Jingcong, they all went to the hangar and raised champagne to celebrate the success. Mr. Li gave a short welcome speech in German and expressed his gratitude. Then they visited the construction of the hangar. The welcomers dispersed around 3:00 PM. Rafiqi and others went to the Cathay Hotel to rest.

Flying Experience: According to the mechanic Dubell, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he told reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers at the airport that the giant aircraft took off from Berlin on the morning of the 3rd of this month, arrived in Athens on the 4th, arrived in Baghdad on the 5th, passed through Persia, crossed the Indian Ocean, arrived in Calcutta on the 6th, flew along the Indian border on the 7th and 8th, arrived in Bangkok, Siam on the 9th, passed through Hanoi on the 10th, and safely arrived in Hong Kong at 4:08 PM that afternoon.

Among them, the weather was not good in the Berlin to Calcutta section, the weather was very good in the Calcutta to Bangkok section, the Bangkok to Hong Kong section was still good, and the wind was very strong on the way from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Fortunately, the parts were complete and the difficulties were finally overcome and it arrived in Shanghai on time. It is also known that the route from Germany to China is a total of 15,200 kilometers. The entire journey is expected to take nine days. This time, Rafiqi and others completed their mission in eight days, which is comparable to the new record of eight days flying set by Mr. Luther, who came to China for the third time. They flew for about eight hours each day and landed to rest in Athens, Baghdad, Teheran, Calcutta, Bangkok, and Hong Kong. All the food was brought from Germany, as there is a refrigerated storage box in the aircraft that can preserve it. Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasian Company, has decided to hold a banquet within the next few days to welcome and celebrate.

### Implementation of Safety Guarantee Measures for Combined Sea-Land Transportation of Goods on the Longhai and Tongpu Railways

Marine Cargo Insurance, Effective from April 1

After the Xi'an Incident, a huge amount of goods destined for Shanghai from the Northwest were accumulated on the Longhai Railway. Recently, due to the eastward transfer of Zhang's troops and the lack of vehicles, freight transport has been slightly delayed. However, the first batch of stranded goods, after the Longhai Railway was fully repaired and opened to traffic, was transported from the China Merchants Bureau's ships at Lao Yao, Haizhou, by combined sea and land transport to Shanghai. In the past month or so, more than 10,000 tons have been loaded, mainly packed cotton. The value of the goods loaded has been

Above Six Million Yuan: Other goods are not included. Now, the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Bureau, in order to plan further and speed up freight transport, have assigned this combined transport route as a regular route. Departures from Shanghai are three times every ten days, departing on the 2nd, 6th, and 9th of each month (ie, the 2nd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 16th, and 19th). There are nine sailings per month. Departures from Lianyungang to Shanghai are on the 1st, 4th, and 7th of each month. The "Haiyun", "Haiyang", and "Hairui" ships are designated to carry them. If there is a congestion of goods and tonnage is needed, non-scheduled trips can be temporarily added. The railway bureau is also striving for speed, loading as soon as the goods arrive. For example, goods from Zhengzhou, loaded to Shanghai, by combined sea and land transport, now only take

Six Days to Arrive: For example, goods loaded in Zhengzhou on the 1st can be transported by ship to Shanghai's docks by the 6th. This speed is unprecedented. In addition, in order to develop Northwest transportation and facilitate the procurement of goods and passengers, the Longhai Railway's "Negotiated Freight Collection Car" and "Collection of Payment for Goods" and other important procedures have been gradually implemented by the China Merchants Bureau's combined transport department, which is convenient for passengers. Starting in July last year, the Longhai Railway Bureau has implemented fire insurance for loaded passengers and goods on land transport. Once the passengers and goods are loaded, the railway bureau is fully responsible for fire insurance, making the transport of goods safer. The China Merchants Bureau is now seeking to ensure the stability and safety of combined transport goods at all costs,

Major Sacrifices: It is determined to handle marine cargo insurance for the entire waterway from Shanghai to Lianyungang. After repeated consultations with the Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau, all marine cargo insurance for combined sea and land transport goods of the Longhai and Tongpu Railways, loaded by the bureau's ships, will be underwritten by the bureau, without increasing any fees from passengers and shippers. The contract has been signed and will be announced and implemented from April 1. This move by the bureau is purely to obtain security for the water and land transport of goods for shippers or passengers. According to Director Wang's statement to reporters yesterday, the detailed measures are currently under review and will be announced soon.

### Exhibits for the Paris Exposition to Be Shipped to France in Two Batches Early Next Month

Chu Minyi Prepares to Attend in Person, Jade Art Preview Will Not Be Extended

After the solicitation of exhibits for China's participation in the Paris International Exposition closed on the 10th, they will be reviewed and packed within a few days and shipped in two batches early next month. The Jade Art Preview has been crowded with visitors for several days, but due to the imminent opening of the exposition, it will not be extended. The details are as follows:

Most Exhibits Transported to Shanghai: The exposition exhibits are divided into two categories: industry and commerce, and education and art. For the industry and commerce section, in addition to special products from various provinces, the association sent letters or personnel to contact and collect them. In Shanghai, because it is the area where China's industry and commerce are concentrated, it invited leaders from various industries to organize an exhibit collection committee to collect them separately. The deadline was the 10th, and most of them have been sent. However, large quantities of Jiangxi porcelain and Gejian lacquerware are already on their way to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, the review committee will be convened around the 15th to conduct a detailed selection and evaluation, and compile catalogs and descriptions. The education section has been collected by education institutions and groups in various provinces and has also been sent.

Chu Prepares to Attend in Person: The five Chinese representatives are Chu Minyi, Zhao Zhiyou, Liu Fucheng, Xie Dongfa, and Liu Xichang, with Chu Minyi as the chairman and representative. Among them, Xie Dongfa is a staff member of the Chinese Embassy in France, and Liu Fucheng also went to France earlier last month and is currently in France, negotiating the location of the exhibition hall. The construction of the exhibition hall will begin after the exhibits are determined. It is said that Chu is preparing to attend in person and will lead secretaries Tian Shoucheng and Nong Ruhui to embark on the Italian ship "Victoria" on the 2nd of next month. If Chu is unable to attend due to official business, Zhao or Liu will go instead.

Divided into Two Batches to Be Shipped to France: The solicitation of exhibits in North China, organized by a branch, has been very smooth recently. It is said that the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has also sent Mrs. Xiong Shaohao and Miss Tang Rongling to participate in the association on their trip to France. It is said that Miss Tang will come to Shanghai from the south this month and travel abroad with Chu and others. The exhibits will also be concentrated and transported to Shanghai. The first batch of exhibits in Shanghai has been scheduled to be shipped on the French postal ship "Zhen Nu Sha" on the 3rd of next month, and the second batch may be shipped on the French postal ship "Adao Si" on the 17th.

Many Visitors to the Jade Art Exhibition: Since the opening of the Jade Art Exhibition on the fourth floor of the Great World Company on the 6th, it has been crowded with visitors for several days, especially on Saturday last week and the two days before. There are about 10,000 people every day. Starting today, two more display tables will be added to display more than 20 exquisite items, including nine jade lions, a gold and green incense burner, a jade "Three Goats Bring Good Fortune" vase, and twelve jade folding screens, which are particularly exquisite.

### Chamber of Commerce Notice to All Industries

Income tax reported by trade associations

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all trade associations yesterday, stating: "Greetings. On the 10th of this month, we received official letter No. 46 from the Shanghai office of the Income Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, which stated: 'Upon investigation, companies and businesses are required to declare various income taxes. In recent months, declarations have been very enthusiastic, which is a testament to the effective leadership of your association and various trade associations. This is highly commendable. However, as this is a novel undertaking, businesses may not fully understand the declaration and payment procedures, resulting in inconsistencies. Therefore, this office has drafted methods for trade associations to report collectively, which have been submitted to the Minister for approval and implementation. Furthermore, it has been instructed that trade associations will assist in the handling of this matter in the future. If any assistance is effective, the Ministry will consider granting rewards.' In addition to the office setting deadlines to separately notify each trade association to send responsible representatives to the office for face-to-face consultations, we are writing to your association for your information and to request that you forward this information to all trade associations for proper handling.' Upon receipt of this letter, we are issuing this notice accordingly. We hope that your association will make preliminary plans and consider whether to appoint special personnel to handle this matter to ensure that future reports are not inconsistent or erroneous. Proper handling of this matter will increase the credibility of trade associations and make those who have not joined feel the need to join immediately. The rise and fall of association affairs depend on this. Please pay attention."

### Yangtze River Cargo, 6 Companies Reduce by 10% Below Wuhu

Overpaid freight returned to customers, above Wuhu still increased by 20%

Along the Yangtze River, since the river water has risen sharply, the shallow water fee has been canceled, and the original freight rate has been increased by 20%, which has been implemented since the 6th of this month. However, at a meeting of the six companies this Tuesday, when discussing various Yangtze River transportation cases, it was considered that for goods loaded in Shanghai and bound for Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Pukou, and Wuhu, due to the competition from land transportation, it was necessary to reduce the 20% increase in freight rates. After discussion among all the representatives, it was decided to reduce the freight rate for outbound goods to the above-mentioned ports by 10% to show preferential treatment. As for the freight rates that have already been loaded and charged with a 20% increase, the six companies are allowed to immediately refund the overcharged 10%. After the proposal was passed, Taikoo, China Merchants, San Peh, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and Ben Line, and other companies notified their customers yesterday that the freight rate for goods shipped to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Pukou, and Wuhu would be calculated with a 10% surcharge. The 10% freight that has already been overpaid can be recovered from each company. For outbound goods loaded to Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang, and Hankou, the 20% increase announced on the 6th will still be applied.

We are holding this farewell party to see him off. Mr. Zhu is a leader in the labor circles. He has spared no effort in alleviating the suffering of laborers and fostering the development of the labor movement. He is truly a lucky star for the labor force. At the 20th International Labor Conference, Mr. Zhu, with his knowledge and experience, negotiated with various parties and achieved results that had not been achieved in previous sessions.

This year, I have again been appointed by the Central Government to attend the World Textile Conference and the 13th International Labor Conference as the labor representative. I deeply feel that my knowledge and experience are insufficient, and I am very apprehensive, but because I was appointed by the Central Government and I cannot refuse, and because of the expectations of the entire labor force, I resolutely attend. The important proposal for this World Textile Conference is to reduce working hours. I have already requested instructions from the Central Government and collected materials from all relevant parties to submit for discussion at the conference. As for the International Labor Conference, our planned proposals are: ㊀ inspection of factories, ㊁ stopping smuggling in North China, and other two major cases. There is also the case of equal treatment for Chinese and foreign workers, which was submitted for discussion in the previous session and should also be promoted to ensure its implementation. I am about to go abroad, and I hope that comrades in the labor circle will give me advice at any time to correct my shortcomings. I am infinitely grateful for the honor and invitation." Finally, Zhao Banfu, Yao ShouKang, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kechang, and Liu Jintai, among others, gave speeches one after another, expressing their hopes that Mr. Zhu would strive for the country and the nation.

### Asia Oil Depot Theft of Large Amounts of Diesel

Totaling More Than Ten Tons Lost Continuously, Investigation Revealed to Be Done by People on the Lighter

The authorities at the Pudong Asia Oil Depot discovered over the past three or four months that diesel fuel had been lost continuously, amounting to more than ten tons. After a secret investigation, it was still difficult to obtain any clues. As a last resort, they reported the information to the Customs Water Police on the 3rd of this month for investigation. The police dispatched detectives Hu Changqing, Shen Changshan, and others to investigate. After several days of investigation, they learned that the case was committed by eight people on the depot's No. 2 lighter, including the old driver, the chief mate, and the sailors. They colluded with receivers to secretly steal and transport the diesel fuel elsewhere for sale while the lighter was loading the diesel fuel, selling it for dozens of yuan per ton. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, they arrested Zhang Xiang, a Hubei native who introduced the receivers. After a thorough interrogation, detectives Huang Songsheng and Gong Qingyun, assisted by Hu and Shen, went quietly to the No. 2 iron lighter of the depot and brought the old driver Tan Qingbiao, the chief mate Zhao Huatang, the sailors Luo Jianbo, Qin Zhida, Zhao Linhua, Zhang Genbao, Han Qixiang, Huang Xuejiao, and others (all from Hubei) to the police station. According to the sailors Luo Jianbo and Qin Zhida, they had done this four times. The first time was before December of last year. Taking advantage of the opportunity to load oil onto the lighter, when it sailed to Pudong without anyone noticing, all eight people on the ship worked together to use a pump to extract the oil and transfer it to a pre-hired boat, which transported it to a secret location. Several pre-arranged receivers sold the oil. The first time, they stole one and a half tons, earning 40 yuan. A week later, they stole another two tons, selling it for 50 yuan. The third time, they stole two and a half tons, selling it for 65 yuan, but the money was not received. The fourth time, they stole four tons, selling it for 100 yuan, but the money was also not received. The money from the first and second times was divided on Dalian Bay Road, divided into eleven shares: the chief mate received 2 shares, the old driver received 2 shares, the second mate received 1.5 shares, the second mate received 1.5 shares, and each sailor received 1 share. Because the money from the third time was not received, the old driver Tan Qingbiao became suspicious and announced his withdrawal, refusing to participate in the fourth theft. They were afraid he would leak the information and argued and fought with Tan. The chief mate Zhao Huatang persuaded them to stop. Tan confessed that he did not know about the theft and sale. Zhao Huatang confessed that he did not know about it at first, but he learned about it when he went to mediate when the sailors and the old driver clashed. The other sailors all admitted to the theft and sale and the division of money. The police chief, believing that the defendants in the case had been interrogated, sent them to the district court for interrogation in the afternoon yesterday.

He stated the case, saying that on February 27th, Gu Wenbao reported to the police station that his wife, Wu Wenjuan, was currently having an affair with Xie Hongbiao and living with him at No. 80, Qingdao Road, requesting an investigation and arrest. The police station then requested the court on the 1st of this month to

Issue a Search Warrant to conduct an investigation. They found the two defendants in bed together and with a child. After the detectives confirmed the facts, they filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. The plaintiff, Gu Wenbao, did not appear in court but retained a lawyer to attend. He requested to attach a civil suit. When questioned, Wu Wenjuan testified that since marrying Gu Wenbao in 1923, she had given birth to a son, who is now twelve years old. Because Gu did not engage in proper work,

And did not provide support, she sent the child to live with her mother and sought her own livelihood. She entered the Huacheng Tobacco Company as a female employee. Gu would come from time to time to take money, and if he was not satisfied, he would quarrel, which soon led to the business being closed. In 1931, unable to bear her husband's suffering, she filed for divorce in the Shanghai District Court, but her request was rejected. In order to maintain a living, she had to

Disregard Her Reputation and work as a prostitute at the Minhe Lane Jade Bookstore. At that time, her husband knew it well and declared that if there were patrons, she could make her own decisions, and he only needed to get some money. Soon after, she met Xie Hongbiao, who learned that her background was pitiful and was willing to help. He said that he did not have a wife and could live with her first. She obtained her husband's consent and lived with Xie until now for four years. Since marrying her husband, for more than ten years, she has

Suffered Agony. She is someone who has received a considerable education. This action was forced by circumstances. When questioned, Xie Hongbiao confessed to living with Wu Wenjuan but did not know that Wu was a married woman. Judge Jin adjourned the hearing for seven days because Gu Wenbao did not appear in court. The two defendants were ordered to pay a bail of one hundred yuan each. Before finding a guarantor, they were entrusted to their defending lawyer for temporary bail.

### Representatives of Anhui Tea Farmers Come to Shanghai Again to Petition

### French Concession Reduces House Tax on Apartments with Water Supply by 5%

Proof with Rent Receipt or Contract

According to the Guomin News Agency, the French Concession Municipal Council in this city, in order to consider the difficulties of merchants last year, specially formulated measures to reduce house tax and notified the tax-paying Chinese in the concession to inform the citizens. It was announced in July of last year. It is now learned that there are many kinds of tax reductions, and the 5% reduction for apartments with water supply is the most common. In the French Concession, there are many apartments where the landlord provides tap water, and most of them can enjoy the right to reduce taxes. However, most residents in the concession are not aware of this measure, resulting in huge losses for citizens. According to a certain gentleman at the place, the Guomin News Agency reporter learned yesterday that it is only necessary to bring the rent receipt or contract to the place to declare, and the 5% tax can be deducted. However, this rent receipt or contract must indicate that the water bill is paid by the landlord to prove it. The same can be done if other methods are used for proof.

### Municipal Health Bureau Bans Exposed Coffins

The Municipal Health Bureau previously received a letter from the Shanghai Cement Company, Longhua Factory, stating that new public cemeteries had been opened on both sides of the factory, allowing people to bury their dead. Now there are countless coffins and bone boxes stacked up, and many are exposed on the ground, not only hindering the appearance of the city but also posing a danger to the health of the factory workers. Therefore, they requested the bureau to investigate and ban them. Now that the bureau has sent personnel to investigate and found the facts to be true, it specially issued Instruction No. 7430 to the Caojing District Municipal Committee, requesting them to find a way to move and bury the coffins and bone boxes on the side of Longhua Road and report it, in order to improve the appearance and emphasize hygiene.

### Maid Accuses Master of Indecency

Civil Court Case Failed and is Appealing; Now Filing Criminal Suit, Court Summoned Yesterday

Chen Huizhen, a woman from Suzhou, 28 years old, came to Shanghai from her hometown in January 1932 to seek a livelihood. She was then hired as a maid by Dai Qinsun, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou in Shanghai, at No. 10, Sandeli, Meibai Ge Road. She was favored by the master and had a relationship with him, becoming Dai's fifth concubine. The family respected her as the Fifth Lady. Later, Dai Qinsun fell in love with another maid, and then he

Loved the New and Tired of the Old. He gave Chen 1,000 taels of silver and drew up a document to sever their relationship. Chen then returned to Suzhou. In January of this year, Chen suddenly came to Shanghai again and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District against Dai Qinsun for severing the family relationship and requested a judgment to pay alimony of 23,760 yuan. Dai denied the love affair between master and servant and taking her as a concubine and presented the document for termination of employment as evidence. After the court ruled, Chen's lawsuit was dismissed.

Unwilling to Accept the Judgment, she appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. On the one hand, she hired Lawyer Wu Chengyu to file a criminal lawsuit against Dai in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Dai of committing indecency. The reason for the prosecution was that Chen Huizhen, the plaintiff, was originally Dai Qinsun's concubine and did not constitute a crime according to the law. However, during the civil lawsuit, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was his servant, and the court also recognized it. Then, since the plaintiff was

The Defendant's Servant, and the defendant committed adultery with her, it clearly violated Article 228 of the Criminal Law, "Whoever takes advantage of his power to rape or commit indecent acts against a person who is subject to his supervision due to public or business relations shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years." The above is in compliance with the regulations, so the prosecution is filed, and a civil suit is attached, and the amount is still

Twenty-three Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty Yuan, etc. The case was opened yesterday morning by Qian Hongye, the chief of the Criminal Court, and the court summoned the plaintiff. Because there was a doubt about the plaintiff's accusations, it was urgent to ask her questions. Therefore, Dai Qinsun was not summoned, and Chen Huizhen was first asked to file the reasons for the prosecution. Then, Judge Qian declared to her, "You have already failed in the civil lawsuit in this court and have filed an appeal, but you have filed a lawsuit in this court. Moreover, you yourself admitted in your complaint that the defendant's behavior does not

Constitute a Crime. Since it is known that the behavior does not constitute a crime, but you still file a lawsuit, and the statute of limitations is also a problem in law, it is better to withdraw this accusation. Otherwise, if it is found after investigation that there is a false accusation, this court will severely punish you. This case will be adjourned for one week for further questioning. If you need to withdraw, then submit a statement to the court within this period. This court will issue a judgment of non-acceptance. Otherwise, it will be handled according to law." After the announcement, the case was adjourned for one week for further questioning.

### A Young Girl Was Frightened to Death by a Terrible Advertisement for "Midnight Song"

Qiu Jialiang Talks About the Circumstances of His Daughter's Death

According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Jinzhu, the daughter of Qiu Jialiang, a member of the First Special District Citizens' Union, died of fright after seeing the terrifying advertisement for "Midnight Song" a few days ago. After the City Union received Qiu's report, it decided to forward a letter to the Public Works Bureau to ban it. The reporter has learned the details as follows: "There are several huge billboards erected on the open space west of the New World on Nanjing Road. The place is located at the tram stop on the first and second roads, so it is very noticeable. Recently, the Jincheng Grand Theater installed a very terrifying advertisement there because it was showing the film 'Midnight Song'. The board depicts an old woman in the shape of a zombie, about ten feet tall, with electric lights shining in her eyes, and her hands raised with sharp claws that can move with the wind, like a demon, making people shudder." A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Qiu's residence at No. 885, Xiuhua Road, yesterday morning. According to him, "I took my daughter to Qi's house on Jing'an Temple Road on the afternoon of March 4. At 6:00 PM that evening, we took Tram No. 1 back. We got off at the New World. My daughter was only eleven years old. After getting off the tram, she suddenly saw the strange figure and shouted in a dumb voice. I comforted her and took her home. Unexpectedly, she had a fever all over her body that night and was constantly startled. Although she was repeatedly treated by Chinese and Western doctors, she never recovered. Her mind was blurred, but she frequently called out 'Zombie Ghost' 'Zombie Ghost'. She died at 11:00 AM on the 7th." Qiu continued, "My daughter is dead, and there is no way to recover. However, such an excessively terrifying advertisement is really not suitable. Therefore, I especially reported to the City Union and asked them to find a way to ban it in order to avoid harm."

### Prohibition of Consignment Sales of Proprietary Medicines in the French Concession

New Medicine Federation Asks for Negotiations

The National Federation of New Pharmaceutical Industries Associations in this city submitted a petition to the Ministry of Health yesterday, "Petition for submission: According to a letter from the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory Industry Association, a member of the association, the association's member, Tiger Brand Yong'an Hall, stated that the French Concession in this city banned foreign grocery stores from selling Yong'an Hall proprietary medicines. This action is nothing more than wanting to force the donation of medicine sales permits and destroy merchants. A proper response should be planned. This is approved." (Omission) "This action by the French authorities is indeed an excessive demand. The association should request the cancellation of the above-mentioned order to ban foreign grocery stores from selling proprietary medicines, in order to comply with the purpose of medicine and health and protect the safety of residents in the concession." This was reported to the association. Based on this, the association investigated that new medicine and new drugs have indeed become more and more prosperous in recent years, but they have not yet been popularized. Formal pharmacies that operate new medicines have not been established universally. Various proprietary medicines are mostly sold by non-pharmaceutical merchants. Before the meeting, according to Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on the Management of Pharmaceutical Merchants, Chinese medicine stores shall not sell Western medicines. In fact, most of the people who sell proprietary medicines everywhere are Chinese medicine stores, tobacco and paper stores, and Chinese and foreign grocery stores. Now, according to the regulations, if they are banned, it will have a great impact on patients. Therefore, the association sincerely requested the ministry to modify it, and the ministry replied with Approval No. 206, allowing flexibility. This shows the ministry's insight into the people's suffering and the utmost intention to protect pharmaceutical merchants. Now, the authorities of the French Concession in Shanghai are ignoring the facts and wantonly destroying stores that sell proprietary medicines with consular permits, and both patients and pharmaceutical merchants are harmed. It is urgent to submit a document to the higher authorities, and sincerely request that the Shanghai Municipal Government be transferred to the Shanghai French Concession authorities to immediately stop the ban, in order to alleviate commercial difficulties and benefit health. This is a virtue." The association also sent letters to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession and the Second Special District City Union to negotiate reasonably. At the same time, it also sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, asking it to automatically remove the ban in order to alleviate commercial difficulties.

### Achieving True Unification Through Economic Construction

— Du Chongyuan

Based on this kind of economic relationship, the development of individuals is especially rapid, while the development of groups is hindered. When Chinese overseas students participate in individual competitions abroad, whether in commerce or academia, they often have amazing performances, but when it comes to group action, they are not as good as others. Therefore, Westerners often say that Chinese people are very smart individually, but become confused with two or more people. Although this statement has a mocking tone, it is not without its truth. This principle can be used to explain various contradictions in Chinese society. Take the parliament as an example. Nationals who have had group training will discuss the issue itself when a question is raised. Although the debate is fierce, once a vote is taken, they must absolutely obey the majority. China is not like this. When a question arises, everyone stands on their own individual position to fight for it. Even after a majority vote, they still develop their stubborn personality and refuse to admit defeat until death. Take group life as an example. Modern group life emphasizes iron discipline and the freedom of organization, but not the freedom of the individual. China is not like this. When organizing a group in the beginning, it can still maintain its unity. As the organization expands, small groups of relatives, villagers, or classmates will emerge. Thus, the viewpoints of interests are different, this is right and wrong, that is long and short, and unfounded rumors arise, wasting all useful energy on these meaningless disputes. People who truly stand on the position of the nation and the nation and want to do something are not believed by others. Take the recent example. When the Xi'an Incident occurred, several newspapers reported that I was in Xi'an and said that I led three thousand students to petition Mr. Chiang for the arrest of several friends in Shanghai. Mr. Chiang refused and severely rebuked me, so I was angry and instigated this disturbance, etc. Many friends saw this report, sweating for me, and wrote to me to quickly publish a statement, but I laughed it off. I said that facts speak louder than words. Mr. Chiang should know whether I did it or not. The gentlemen in Nanjing who are responsible for the party, government, and military should know even more. Why should I make a statement? Chinese society has never been able to settle accounts of right and wrong. It is right for people like me who talk and run around to be misunderstood when things happen. I don't find it strange. As for asking me how I feel about the incident, I want to take this opportunity to write down some of the feelings of the compatriots who are suffering in Guanwai, so that you can know my thoughts. During Mr. Chiang's capture, a friend of mine was sent to the Northeast to inspect. According to him, when the average Northeasterner heard this news, it was like a bolt from the blue, and they were as anxious as ants on a hot pot. However, they did not dare to express it publicly, so they secretly ran to the temple to burn incense and kowtow, praying silently for Mr. Chiang. When they heard the news of Mr. Chiang's return to Nanjing, everyone was overjoyed, but they did not dare to express it publicly, so they secretly bought some liquor and drank heavily to celebrate. Only people who have lost their province can understand this situation. Because the deeper the suffering, the more urgent the hope for national unification. (To be continued)

### Dispute Over Property of Manure King Ma

Ma Lushan Should Get One-Twentieth: Ma Chen氏 Appeals Against Original Judgment

After the death of Ma Fuqi, the "Manure King," his wife Ma Agui, and their eldest son Ma Hongkui, Ma Chen氏, the widow of Hongkui, filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing her brother-in-law Ma Honggen and her husband's concubine A Da of encroaching on the estate of her parents-in-law and husband. As a result, the case against Ma Honggen was withdrawn due to family reconciliation, and A Da was acquitted. Before the first wave had subsided, another arose. Ma Qin氏, the mistress of Ma Hongkui, together with her son Ma Lushan, filed a lawsuit against Ma Chen氏, the wife of Hongkui, and their children Ma Lusen, Lu Zhen, and Lu Ying, seeking confirmation of their identities. After a trial by the Second Special Court, the court ruled that Ma Lushan was confirmed as an heir of Ma Hongkui, and Ma Qin氏's request was rejected. Ma Chen氏 and her children were dissatisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court and the Supreme Court.

Both were Dismissed: After the original judgment was upheld and became final, Ma Qin氏, acting as the legal representative, and her son Ma Lushan, hired lawyers Yu Zhongluo and Lu Shaozong to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against their uncle Ma Hongsheng, Ma Honggen, and Hongkui's wife and children Ma Chen氏, Ma Lusen, Lu Zhen, and Lu Ying, seeking

Division of Property: They requested a judgment to divide the jointly owned property under the name of Ma Guiji and the estate under the name of Ma Hongkui. As a result, the court ruled that Ma Lushan should receive one-twentieth of the property under the name of Ma Guiji, and Ma Lushan should receive one-fifth of the estate under the name of Ma Hongkui. The plaintiff was to bear one-tenth of the litigation costs, and the defendants were to bear nine-tenths, etc. Now, the defendants are all dissatisfied with the judgment and have filed appeals with the Third Branch of the High Court. Because Ma Chen氏 and her children

Should Receive Property: Are still under the control of their uncles and have no ability to pay the appeal costs, they requested litigation assistance. Yesterday, Judge Tong Jishi of the Third Branch of the High Court came to the Fourth Civil Division to summon the appellant Ma Chen氏 and her daughter Lu Zhen, along with their lawyer. The appellee Ma Qin氏 and Ma Lushan were represented by their lawyer. The appellants, except for Ma Honggen and Hongsheng brothers, had already prepared

Reasons for Appeal: The reasons for appeal of Ma Chen氏 and others have not yet been submitted. Today, the hearing was about litigation assistance. According to the lawyer of the appellants Ma Chen氏 and others, the appellants are unable to pay the litigation costs and requested litigation assistance, or requested that Ma Honggen and Hongsheng be ordered to pay on their behalf from the total accounts of the property, and then deduct it from the amount that the appellants should receive in the future. The court ordered an investigation and instructed the appellants to submit the reasons for appeal as soon as possible for review.

### Overview of Shanghai Experimental Primary School (6)

Special Report by This Newspaper: Investigation by Hu Zuyin

(1) When starting to teach various new methods in arithmetic, a comparative experiment was conducted on starting with word problems versus starting with formula problems.

(2) When starting to teach subtraction in arithmetic, a comparative experiment was conducted on using the complementary method versus not using the complementary method.

The two experiments conducted in the second semester of the 25th year were:

(1) A comparative experiment on using textbooks versus not using textbooks for teaching common knowledge in the middle grades.

(2) A comparative experiment on using a large unit organization method versus a small unit organization method for social studies materials in the upper grades.

(2) Experimentation with new teaching methods: In addition to conducting comparative experiments on teaching problems, the school also conducted experiments with new teaching methods. The school experimented with individualized teaching methods in the upper grades, problem-based teaching methods in the middle grades, and whole-language teaching methods in the lower grades. As a result of the experimentation with individualized teaching methods, the school compiled and printed作业概要 (zuoye gaiyao) [assignment summaries] and individualized tests for the four subjects of Chinese, arithmetic, social studies, and science in the upper grades. As a result of the experimentation with problem-based teaching methods, the school compiled and printed the problem-based teaching outline for the middle grades. As a result of the experimentation with whole-language teaching methods, the school compiled and printed the theory and practice of whole-language teaching, the preliminary drafts of lower-grade work unit experiment plans 1 and 2, and unit teaching materials.

The school's research work is temporarily divided into two types: thematic research and subject-based research. In thematic research, each teacher selects a topic at the beginning of the semester, studies it with focused attention, and reports on their research findings after one semester or one year. Subject-based research is conducted under the direction of the chief teacher of each subject, who convenes the teachers in charge and related personnel to study together regularly. The results of the thematic research that have been compiled and printed are: the Teaching Outline Collection for Revolutionary Memorial Days, Scientific Achievement Examination Methods, Standardization of Rural Schools, Research on the Communication Problems between Primary and Secondary Schools, Comparative Research on the Vocabulary Used in Two Chinese Textbooks, Child Training in Extraordinary Times, and Classification of School Properties. The results of the subject-based research that have been compiled and printed are: Teaching Process and Examples for Each Subject, Detailed Items for Work Subject Teaching, Detailed Items for Music Subject Teaching, Theory and Experimentation on Elementary School Arithmetic Teaching Materials Research, Compilation of Elementary School Arithmetic Teaching Aids, Elementary Party Ideology Teaching Materials for Lower Grades, and Theory and Practice of Elementary School Civic Training.

7. Five-Year Construction Plan

In October of the 21st year, when the school held its fifth anniversary of reorganization, it formulated a new five-year construction plan. This plan was carried out in five major areas, and a brief outline of its main points is as follows:

(1) Fundraising: As of November of the 25th year, the school's current savings amounted to over 50,000 yuan. Of this amount, 5,500 yuan was allocated by the provincial treasury as temporary expenses, and the remaining 44,500 yuan was raised by the school's faculty and staff over the past four years. The school's funds have now been used to pay for the construction of new school buildings and the purchase of equipment.

(2) Expansion of Branches: According to the original plan, the school originally intended to purchase neighboring land in the first section of Shangwen Road for the purpose of expanding the school buildings. However, this was not realized due to the exorbitant price of the neighboring land. In the spring of the 23rd year, Shanghai Provincial Middle School decided to move to Wujiagang and allocated 50 mu of land for the school's partial relocation. The school's plan to expand its land was thus realized.

(3) Construction of School Buildings: The school had 50 mu of land in Wujiagang and had raised over 50,000 yuan in funds, so it mortgaged its savings to build new school buildings. The school buildings that have now been completed in Wujiagang include a two-story classroom and office building with 18 rooms, costing 26,500 yuan; a gatehouse with 2 rooms, costing 1,300 yuan; a kitchen with 2 rooms, costing 500 yuan; a pavilion, costing 380 yuan; and two single-story dormitories with 18 rooms, costing 8,880 yuan. The total construction cost was 37,560 yuan. The school plans to build a gymnasium and auditorium in the near future.

(4) Increasing Equipment: After completing the construction of the new school buildings, the school also plans to develop the campus and playground and to carry out the project of laying grass and planting trees. As for the equipment inside the school buildings, such as water and electricity, sanitation, furniture, decorations, books, instruments, and sports equipment, the school is also gradually purchasing them.

(5) Enriching Content: In addition to carrying out the education of the Three Principles of the People and experimenting with new teaching methods according to the original plan, the school also formulated five work plans based on the new school buildings as a rural environment, and carried them out accordingly. These five work plans are: 1. Experiment with labor education. 2. Implement school liaison. 3. Assist in the promotion of universal education. 4. Promote rural hygiene. 5. Facilitate village transportation.

Looking at the progress of the above-mentioned new five-year construction plan, we deeply admire the spirit and perseverance of the school's principal and faculty in actively developing the school. It is now heard that the school is also engaged in the formulation of the third phase of the five-year construction plan in the last semester in order to continue its efforts.

8. Centennial Savings

In the summer of the 19th year, the faculty and staff of the school, feeling the strain on educational funding, and knowing that the school's educational endeavors must continue to develop, had the idea of ​​a centennial savings plan. On August 1 of the same year, the school deposited 100 national currency yuan in the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, for fixed deposit and withdrawal, with a ten-year rollover, for a period of one hundred years, at the end of which more than 1.729 million national currency yuan can be obtained. However, as this savings fund is for a long period of time, six rules were established as a common agreement, and were submitted to the Education Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government for filing, in order to be serious. Although this kind of savings fund cannot produce any immediate results, it can serve as the foundation for a hundred years of educational endeavors. It is hoped that all elementary schools in the country will share this far-sighted vision and will follow suit, so that the education of our country will have a good economic foundation in a hundred years.

However, trading firms are not following the rise, because Shanghai has approximately one million bales of cotton in stock (old weight), and factory absorption is sufficient. Therefore, even though foreign cotton is rising sharply, market sentiment has not followed. The afternoon momentum tightened. Market discussions suggested that if foreign cotton continues to advance, there is concern that Chinese merchants may export, so the Manchurian month hit a recent high.

Distant Months Discover New High Prices

The spot cotton market opened with prices rising across all months due to the continued advance of American cotton and the increasing strength of Indian cotton. Speculative traders covered positions slightly, with distant months rising three and a half points. In the second session, prices declined with the poor performance of the yarn market. The spot cotton results were that all months rose one and a half to three points compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon market opened with very brisk trading. More traders covered short positions in the market. Rumors spread that foreign firms were looking at cotton, which led to much speculation and even higher prices. In general, foreign cotton has recently risen over 100 points, while spot cotton has only risen approximately one yuan. When prices are low, speculators move in. It was found that Japanese firms were buying slightly. The results were that all months rose one and a half to three points compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Xincheng sold 4,800 bales, Taichang 3,500 bales, Zhenda 1,200 bales, Jinchang 1,100 bales, Jifeng 1,500 bales, Tongji 1,300 bales, Gengfeng 1,700 bales, Renfeng 3,000 bales, Dachangcheng 3,600 bales, Shengyuan 2,900 bales, Changhe 2,600 bales, Taifeng 2,900 bales, Yuanyi 4,600 bales, and Fengtai 1,400 bales. Mingde bought 8,800 bales, Yuda 5,800 bales, Hengyi 2,100 bales, Juxing 1,200 bales, Taichang 2,400 bales, Yichang 1,800 bales, Fukang 3,700 bales, Yongda 1,200 bales, Yuanxingchang 2,700 bales, and Jinghua 3,600 bales. The market prices for the day are compared below:

Japanese Firms Purchase More Spot Cotton

Spot cotton consumption is still fairly good, with Japanese factories increasing their volume. The source has not been reported.

The yarn market was flat in the morning but rose in the afternoon, showing a slight upward trend. This was because American cotton was advancing strongly, and market sentiment was somewhat excited. However, former bulls have recently turned very short, hedging all yarn received with March futures, so the market is still ordinary. At the same time, spring sales have not been very strong, and there are approximately 25,000 bales of yarn in stock. Ultimately, the market's advance or retreat will depend on the demand for spot yarn.

The Cotton Market Finally Provides Assistance

The spot yarn market opened in the morning with prices slightly rising, because American cotton was rising, and market sentiment was somewhat firm. However, after the opening, it was heard that spot yarn business was not strong, and settlement prices were being pushed down by downstream customers. The price of 20-count Golden Chicken yarn plunged more than two yuan, so the momentum weakened, and market prices gradually declined. The spot yarn results were that all months were unchanged from the previous day's closing price, except for June, which rose only 0.2 yuan. The afternoon market opened with No. 3 yarn still falling, but the market for distant months was firm again. Shorts covered positions, tightening the market slightly. In the second session, raw cotton rose, putting the yarn market in a better position. The results were that all months rose 0.9 to 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Yuda sold 1,000 bales, Yukang 1,200 bales, Gengfeng 1,850 bales, Dachangcheng 1,250 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, Runkang 1,150 bales, Dachang 1,100 bales, Fukang 650 bales, Shouchang 550 bales, Jinchang 700 bales. Mingde bought 1,000 bales, Hengyi 1,200 bales, Taichang 2,400 bales, Yongda 1,500 bales, Tonghe 1,000 bales, Yuanyi 1,350 bales, Xiecheng 1,000 bales, Yuanda 600 bales. The market prices for the day are compared below:

Spot Yarn Sales Exist, But Prices are Falling

Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that various firms bought a total of 1,567 bales throughout the day, but prices fell by 0.5 yuan. Customer purchases were as follows:

No. 3 Yarn Continues to Rise

An Osaka telegram on the 11th stated that No. 3 futures yarn rose 2.1 to 3.3 yuan. Near-term was 256.2 yuan, and distant-term was 261.4 yuan. Futures cotton rose 0.25 to 0.65 yuan. Near-term was 79.2 yuan, and distant-term was 82.9 yuan.

Egyptian Cotton Ginning Report

An Alexandria telegram on the 10th stated that the Egyptian government released the ginning report today, as follows (unit: contars):

### Piece Goods

Good Demand for Poplin and Bleached Cloth

Japanese Firms Undertake Large Orders from Nanyang and Newchwang

Therefore, Eastern Fine Cloth and Fine Twill are Strongest

Yesterday's fabric market saw a slight increase in demand for seasonal patterned goods such as poplin, bleached cloth, and satin due to the rise in yarn prices and the clearing weather. Tianjin and Hunan-Hubei firms were the most active. Each fabric seller's offers were flat. Eastern fine cloth and fine twill were the strongest, rising 0.025 to 0.05 yuan, due to Japanese firms taking on large orders from Nanyang and Newchwang. Newchwang firms typically unfreeze their ports around the Spring Equinox, with large imports of white cloth and fine cloth. Each batch often exceeds one thousand pieces. Although domestic demand is mediocre, each factory is still experiencing shortages. However, Chinese fine cloth and fine twill sales to the north have disappeared, and the market is sluggish. Japanese imported New Earth bleached cloth is also selling well in Newchwang. Currently, Japanese firms have commissioned Chinese bleaching and dyeing factories in Shanghai to produce it. In addition to using Eastern fine twill for bleaching, the uniforms for civil training in various places are also using it, dyed in grass green and grass yellow, causing a shortage of spot goods and high prices.

### Grain

Many Longs See Opportunity and Emerge

Near-term Flour Prices Fall Below the Four Yuan Threshold

Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices fluctuated inconsistently across different months. Recent sharp declines were observed, with foreign wheat prices showing gains: Chicago up 29 cents to $1.00, Canada up 9 cents to $1.10, and Liverpool up 2 pence. Initial pricing reflected the high price of foreign wheat, naturally driving up expectations. For example, March and April deliveries initially rose by 2-3 cents. However, reality proved contrary, and prices soon plummeted. Due to sluggish actual sales this month, many longs were gradually exiting. Outside speculators, also long, had no choice but to unload, leading to near-term instability. Distant deliveries, supported by hedging buys, fared slightly better. By the afternoon opening, the current month saw anxious longs selling aggressively, pushing prices below the four-yuan mark. Selling pressure intensified, driving prices as low as 9.725 cents. April deliveries were relatively resilient, briefly entering the four-yuan range. July and August deliveries remained stable as manufacturers did not sell and outside investors hedged. The current near-term decline is due to stagnant customer sales and the delayed realization that outside speculators had artificially inflated prices, marking the beginning of a realistic correction.

Flour Prices Drop, Near-term Wheat Declines, New Harvest Rises

Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened calmly in the morning, with prices mostly stable across different months. Despite significant reported gains in foreign wheat prices, the standard for the current month was difficult to sustain due to sluggish flour sales. Thus, initial prices were only slightly better by 3 cents, and April was better by 2 cents. By closing, prices fell back 2 cents as flour prices rose and then fell again, dampening sentiment. Deliveries from June onwards saw little activity and unfavorable weather, resulting in slightly better prices. By the afternoon opening, near-term flour prices saw a sharp decline, softening prices for March and April deliveries. Although the supply of spot wheat was scarce, flour sales from local and out-of-town mills were equally weak. Consequently, inland mills were not actively preparing for wheat purchases, contributing to weakened sentiment. Deliveries from June onwards remained stable, improving by 2-3 cents. The spot wheat market saw a slight decrease of 3-4 cents, with only 400-500 bags traded. Northern Jiangsu wheat was priced at 6.55-6.50 yuan.

8,000 Bags of Rough Indica Rice Shipped to Guangdong

Although Cargo Owners Are Anxious to Sell... The Market Remains Firmly High

Yesterday, demand for customer-sourced indica rice remained strong, and Guangdong market activity was lively. Although cargo owners were eager to sell, the market remained stable, especially for brown rice, which attracted attention from Guangdong buyers, driving prices up by 5-6 cents. Other rice varieties also saw slight gains of several cents. Guangdong buyers purchased 7,000-8,000 bags of brown rice. Demand for machine-milled rice was also good, with continued activity in the market. Henan buyers also purchased 414 bags of Ningbo and Taizhou rice. Xiamen market appetite weakened, but Guangdong buyers remained active, boosting sentiment. Total daily transactions included 11,700 bags of Jiangxi rice, 4,270 bags of Hunan rice, over 2,000 bags of Hansha rice, 308 bags of Wu rice, 614 bags of Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou rice, and 1,000 bags of rough yangjian rice.

Hankou Short-term Soybeans See Sole Active Trading

High Price of Local Beans Drives Shift to Short-term Beans

Yesterday, the soybean market turned quiet, with Dalian prices softening and reduced sales. However, Hankou short-term soybeans were exceptionally active, with prices rising by 2-3 cents. This was mainly because local bean cargo holders were firm on their selling prices, making it difficult to depress prices. As a result, buyers shifted their attention to cheaper short-term beans. Thus, yesterday's short-term soybean transactions surged to over 4,000 bags, with oil mills, inland buyers, and Guangdong buyers as the main purchasers. Other beans saw only sporadic sales, including 230 bags of Tancheng beans, 400 bags of Du beans and Shasha yellow beans, 260 bags of Shashi beans, 70 bags of Sipingjie beans, 190 bags of Han late beans, and 500 bags of Jiujiang late beans. (Today is the memorial day for the passing of the Premier, markets are closed.)

Why Is Saigon Rice Arriving?

Even Small Quantities Are Worth Noting

Most Flour Shipped from Hankou to Shanghai Is Transshipped

Our country purchases foreign rice to supplement domestic food supplies. The annual imports are substantial. Since the bumper harvests in various regions last year, such imports appear to be disappearing. Even Guangdong Province, which traditionally relied on foreign rice, is no longer purchasing it and is instead sourcing from the Yangtze River, with large shipments already underway as previously reported. Yesterday, the French vessel "Bainetun" (transliteration) imported 615 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, which were unloaded at the China Merchants Bureau's middle warehouse. Whether this foreign rice was purchased by Chinese merchants is currently unclear. However, amidst claims of domestic rice sufficiency, this import raises suspicions among observers.

Since flour prices have been high, several thousand or even tens of thousands of bags of Hankou flour are often shipped to Shanghai for transshipment to Tianjin. Nanjing also sees some transshipment. While it cannot be said that there are no shipments from Shanghai to the Yangtze River, it can only be described as minimal, or small quantities of flour are shipped to areas along the Yangtze River, such as Wuhu and Wuxue.

### Securities

Government Bonds Seem Difficult to Recover Slightly

Because People Buy as Soon as They See Small

Yesterday's government bond market conditions, because of strong sentiment, the trend rose as it rotated. The fight between bullish and bearish big players was quite intense. Because the bears continued to aggressively sell off, but because retail investors were optimistic and buying was still strong, the market price turned to rise in the struggle, and re-entered the rotation. Trading on the counter was also calm. When the market opened in the morning, retail investors bought very enthusiastically, and 35-3 and other bonds also gradually saw buying, while 5-43 and other bonds still had a lot of selling. The market price improved by five cents to 25 cents across the board. Type A bonds were sold at No. 11, falling 10 cents. The second round saw fierce competition between bullish and bearish players, and 43-32 and other bonds continued to sell off, while 35-54 and retail investors and others still had a strong appetite. Type C and other bonds rose and fell indecisively, while Type A bonds recovered 12 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the trend became more and more stable. The buying volume of No. 35 continued to be strong, and the market price improved by five cents to 20 cents across the board. Type A next month, because of a large number of sales by No. 32, fell slightly by 10 cents. The closing transaction was very free, bullish and bearish players were still holding steady, and retail investors were still pouring in to buy. Type E and other bonds rose slightly by five cents during the rotation. The closing result was a general increase of 10 cents to 35 cents. The total number of transactions was 3.55 million yuan. The comparison table of price increases and decreases is as follows (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):

### North and South Goods

Black Leaf Branches Are Out of Stock

Although the arrival of Orchid Bamboo branches has been sparse recently, sales have not increased, so the market situation is also very depressed. The trade side had no formal opening. However, it was heard that several hundred boxes had been sold in the dark market, only about one yuan more than last winter. The current market price is 27 yuan. It is found that the stock of Black Leaf branches in the trade warehouse has been exhausted, and it is heard that the producing area has been limited, and most of them are directly transported to Wenzhou and Taizhou for sales.

### Silk and Tea

Unprecedented Boom in New York Silk Market

Over 9,000 Bales of Silk Futures Traded

Many New Silk Opened in This City

Recently, the overseas silk market has been booming. On the one hand, it is because the demand from American weaving factories has been gradually increasing, and on the other hand, it is still because speculators are joining in the short-covering transactions, which has contributed to the prosperity of the silk price. Yesterday, New York raw silk 83 points and 75 points each rose another two points, while Chinese silk rose three points. The exchange market rose sharply by seven points in the near-term, and also rose six points in the distant term. The amount of transactions reached 9,370 bales, which can be called the highest record in recent years, and the prosperity of the New York silk market can also be inferred. Lyon silk prices were still sold at the original price, Yokohama spot rose 5 yuan, futures rose 11 yuan. Shanghai silk market, affected by the repeated rise in foreign silk prices, the silk market situation has also changed from quiet to prosperous. Except for the poor transactions in the French firm, the American firm's appetite is quite strong, and they are all new silk transactions. Half of yesterday's sales were high-grade white silk, and the selling price was quite stable. The transaction was 270 bales. The price of goods in the user's silk market was also popular, and the selling price was 10 yuan stronger than the previous day.

### Statistics

Workers' Cost of Living Index for February

Has Reached the Highest Peak in Four Years

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau announced yesterday that the workers' cost of living index in this city for February 1937 was 112.63, which was 1.25% higher than the previous month, and 7.31% higher than 104.96 in the same month last year, reaching the highest peak in four years. This is because the prices of rice, noodles, vegetables, and cloth have continued to rise. The index of each rate is as follows:

### Review of American Prosperity and Raw Silk Consumption (Continued from the 8th)

— Wang Tianyu

From the above table, it can be seen that China's exports of raw silk to the United States in the past ten months have decreased compared with the previous year. According to the raw silk export report of the Silk Inspection Group of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, China's exports to the United States in the past eleven months last year were 10,802 bales, compared with 17,963 bales in the same period of the previous year, a decrease of 7,161 bales, a decrease of about 40%. In terms of the amount of exports to the United States, China is obviously making concessions to Japan. However, when we take a further step to examine the consumption of raw silk in the United States, China can not only maintain the average level of the previous year, but also increase by about 10%. Among the ten months, June was the lowest, reaching only 52% of the base number, and then it rose step by step, and by October it had risen to a height of 129 points. However, the consumption of Japanese silk clearly failed to maintain the level of the previous year. The average of the past ten months last year was only 84% of the average base number of the previous year. Although September and October also showed a slight recovery, they were still within 100 points in October.

Statistics on the consumption of Chinese silk and Japanese silk in the United States (the average month in 1935 is 100)

(Note) The base number of Japanese silk is 39,663 bales, and the base number of Chinese silk is 1,259 bales.

As shown in the above table, it can be seen that the consumption competition between Chinese silk and Japanese silk is very fierce, and the results in the past ten months have exceeded Japanese silk by 25 points, which shows that although Chinese silk has shown concessions in terms of exports to the United States, it is rising sharply in terms of consumption. This is a very gratifying thing, and according to the two tables above, the two items of Japan's exports to the United States and consumption have the same index of 84 as the average base number of the previous year, which shows that the decline in Japan's imports is undoubtedly due to the decline in the consumption of Japanese silk in the American market. However, the decline in China's exports to the United States is the opposite because of the large amount of raw silk stored in the United States, and there is no adverse trend in the consumption of Chinese silk itself, which is something that we should pay more attention to.

6. Conclusion

The United States is the largest customer of raw silk consumption in the world, as mentioned earlier. Although the entire consumption field of the United States is monopolized by Japan, and China occupies a very small position. However, from the perspective of China itself, the United States has to be said to be a major consumer object of China. According to the raw silk export report of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, the amount of exports from Shanghai alone is about 11,000-30,000 bales per year, which actually exceeds the amount of exports to Europe. In the six years from 1930 to 1935, the occupancy rate of the total export amount was probably between one-quarter and one-half, so the changes in the United States regarding raw silk will immediately have the same impact on China, which is not accidental.

Since the raw silk consumption market in the United States is so important to China, we must pay 12 points of attention to all the situations in the United States regarding raw silk, as well as the political, economic, and social trends. This is undoubtedly true. Now, according to the analysis in the previous sections, we can get several specific concepts of American prosperity and raw silk consumption in summary: First: The consumption of American raw silk and the rise of prosperity are not in proportion. Although from the perspective of total consumption value, there is a certain amount of increase. Second: The upward trend of American prosperity directly stimulates the high price of raw silk and indirectly promotes the decline of raw silk consumption. Third: The upward trend of American prosperity indirectly supports the encroachment of rayon into the raw silk consumption field. Fourth: The competition between Chinese silk and Japanese silk in the American market is very fierce, and in the middle of last year, it still maintained the advantages gained in the previous year and actively attacked the Japanese silk camp.

Finally: What should be specially mentioned here to the Chinese people is (1) Do not be overly optimistic about raw silk because of the prosperity of the United States, but of course, there is no need to be pessimistic. (2) How should we actively improve the quality of Chinese silk to fight against Japanese silk and hope to restore the past position? How should we actively reduce the price of Chinese silk to fight against rayon and expect to win the final victory? This point, I hope the Chinese people will pay close attention to it. (End)

Shenbao Literary Supplement

### A Family

— Bai Wei

"Selling Shandong pears, hey!..."

"Selling Siamese tangerines, hey!..."

Whenever there were hawkers selling fruits in the alley, the children in the alley always liked to follow the hawkers, gathering around the fruit stalls piled with green, yellow, red, and purple fruits. The children's mothers called their little treasures from the balcony, the window, or the doorway, or called the hawkers to buy some pears, grapes, or tangerines.

The young mistress of this family could be said to be the most frequent and close customer of the fruit hawkers in the whole alley. The fruit hawkers often placed their stalls under her window, and lengthened their voices to call out a few more times, so that the young mistress dragged her three-year-old, exquisite, lively, and beautiful child, to pick the best pears, bananas, grapes, or tangerines from the stall, and carried them back to her own room. The child followed his mother with joy, wanting to eat.

The child must eat fruit after meals. In the morning, he ate A-grade milk, bread, and cream-filled biscuits, and wore beautiful clothes handmade by his mother. His exquisite and intelligent eyes not only recognized which child in the alley was wealthy and educated, and which child was hardworking, uneducated, and despicable; but also knew which of the guests coming and going was deceitful and insulting, and which was respectful and admirable. The eyes of this three-year-old child also recognized the five newspapers they subscribed to, and the three newspapers subscribed to by Mr. Dan on the third floor. Every day, he would not make a mistake in delivering these newspapers to each person's room, "Shenbao, Libao, Da Wanbao!" He read and handed you each newspaper, and asked, "Is there any news in the newspaper?" "Is there any good show today?"

He never cried, always happily jumped and played, inventing his own ways of playing from morning to night. When he was tired of playing, he would also talk to his mother about his father who was far away in Hong Kong.

Gradually, he often cried in the room, crying very sadly and emotionally. Why was he crying? Mr. Dan on the third floor was very strange to hear him crying, but for a long time could not understand it, and after a long time, he realized that it was his mother who was beating and scolding him. Why did the mother often beat and scold him? It is said that the mother's temper became bad. Gradually, he quarreled with his mother, and the mother said, "If you don't listen to me, I'll leave." He replied, "Just leave! I'll take the bankbook to the bank, take out a few hundred dollars to buy a mother!"

From this child's proud tone, proud eyes; from his mother's artistic and beautiful display, everyone felt that this was a family with sufficient economic resources.

The child cried more and more often, crying too sadly and emotionally. The mother always closed the door, not letting anyone in to know the reason for the child's crying. Later, the mother and Mr. Dan became very close, and often talked about her unsatisfactory things, and talked about how her temper became very bad in a few years of unsatisfactory life. Only then did Mr. Dan speculate that the child's crying was replacing a part of his mother's most painful spirit. It must be that the mother gave him ugly eyebrows, expressions, or beatings and scoldings when she was sad. The child was too nervous, and would cry bitterly when he saw bad expressions. But can this be blamed on his mother?

"A life-chasing ghost! My life will be chased away by him..."

Every time she mentioned these things, her two curved eyebrows were tightly locked, and her fair face was covered with a sad color.

"I want to be independent and make a living, or find a way to go to college, and I can't follow that stupid fool anymore! But when I think of having a child, my heart softens, how pitiful a child without a father is!"

When she said this, she sobbed sadly, with endless regrets. From this, Mr. Dan knew how this young mistress was distressed about her own happiness and future, and was ruined by a "life-chasing ghost"; he also knew that this young woman, who came from a noble family, although she was very unhappy with her husband's thoughts, actions, and stupidity, still endured unspeakable hardships and was trying to put on a show. Her vain and wealthy coat wrapped a pale face, and she was living a life of eating rough vegetables without even oil and salt every day. Her cloth clothes were also sewn by her own hands.

Her family wanted her to go back to attend a wedding banquet, and sent travel expenses from the distant north. She used that money to buy a gauze wreath on the bride's head, velvet fabric for the bride, silk fabric, and all kinds of gifts. She had no money to make clothes for herself. Mr. Dan understood this, so he asked:

"Why do you want to buy these beautiful gifts?"

"My family originally didn't allow me to marry my man. I haven't been back since I got married. I have to put on a show so that my family doesn't know what kind of life I'm really living."

This was her heartfelt words, the best way to cover up poverty!

Two days before leaving, she prepaid the rent from the tenants, rushed to make two clothes, and also prepaid the rent from Mr. Dan that was still far away. Mr. Dan almost risked his life, dragging his illness to find the money and hand it to her in a quarter of an hour. A beautiful car sent this beautiful young mistress and her child to the North Railway Station. Everyone in the alley who saw her off thought that this wealthy lady was very outstanding? From then on, there was one less good customer for the fruit hawker in the alley, and one less proud and beautiful child.

From then on, this family was left with four tenants living in her house because they had paid the rent. Mr. Dan's friend came and said, "Are you planning to move? Her man is so stupid that he's not worth three coppers. He's been in Hong Kong for a long time and can't find a job. They owe a lot of rent. That woman has probably slipped away and will never come back."

Mr. Dan felt uneasy, but he had just been forced to pay the future rent. At this moment, he was running around to find the rent and had fallen ill. He was lying in bed and could not move. He had no money, no medicine, no servants, and his stomach was starving. How could he move? He could only think of the landlady's words. The landlady would be back within a week, and he waited for the landlady to come back.

The landlady left without a trace, and there was no news of the landlord's return. Electricity, newspapers, milk, the patrol room, and bill collectors came one after another. He owed more than twenty yuan for milk money. The milkman insisted on taking things from his room. He owed twenty-five yuan for newspaper money. The newspaper seller was worried and looked like he was about to cry. The one who collected patrol donations scolded Mr. Dan by mistake. The big landlord also said that he owed eight months' rent, came to inventory her things, and was about to seal the house immediately. The tenants who could leave left, and those who could move were moving. In the end, only Mr. Dan was left in this family who could not move. Mr. Dan was a woman with the same fate as this landlady. I'm afraid she was tens or hundreds of times more painful than the landlady. She had been seriously ill for many years. Now she was dragging a painful leg, an extremely painful half of her stomach, and a painful, non-stop pain in her back and mind, lying miserably. She was lying, lying, with no money to see a doctor, and her diet was intermittent. She was living a life of eating noodles for four coppers a meal, and sometimes she couldn't even do that. Her miserable pain could only be relieved by secretly shedding tears every day. Because she had no spoiled child to vent her anger on, and no "life-chasing ghost" to rent a house for her to be a second landlord, so that she could eat milk for free, read newspapers for free, and live in a house for free in the capacity of a second landlord, and even have to prepay the tenants' rent and escape far away. She could only lie miserably, letting this empty house be her tomb.

But this empty house could not be her tomb. In the three days of the deadline, the big landlord had to have all the tenants move out, otherwise they would have to pay ninety yuan to sign a contract, or they would have to be detained in the patrol room, and all the things would be locked in the room and not allowed to be taken out. At this time, how was Mr. Dan's state of mind compared to the landlady who walked away freely? She didn't have a penny, and she was sick and couldn't move.

Who would be willing to see through the fate of the women of this family?

### Imitation of Ancient Brain Bottles

### "Wing Shadows"

— Yan Dachun

Each winter, the poet and philosopher Maeterlinck always provides us with an honest inventory of the goods he has stored for a year, asking readers to find their spiritual sustenance within. The author of "Wing Shadows" (L'Ombre des Ailes, published by Fasquellle) has no intention of confusing us; he couldn't have chosen a more appropriate title than "Wing Shadows." This symbolic name is enough to make one believe the statement, "We do not see our thoughts; we only see their wing shadows." In Maeterlinck's opinion, the realm of shadows is the only solace people can find.

In this book, he tells us about the philosophy of life and death, and the problems of humans and superhumans. To dispel a kind of delusion, he begins by telling us that we should stop believing in nothingness. "Nothingness" is indeed a word too magical and worthless. When we understand that "death is life," and that we are merely "agents of the past and future," nothing can stop us from entering into the life of the world. If people want to realize Icarus' dream, they should know how to add wings to themselves, but will having wings be able to conquer their souls?

Maeterlinck tells us, "I shall leave this life because I have strived to know everything, but have gained nothing." However, his search is impartial and tenacious: here we can hear him alternately questioning astronomers and astrologers, physicists and spiritual researchers, even diviners. Finally, he comes to a decisive conclusion: "The supernatural is no more daunting than the natural."

He writes the following words to explain his faith: "To pursue oneself at a high place is to pursue God." He faithfully guides us to high places with the poets Nerval, Swinburne, or Th. Brown. There, he gives new meaning to myths and sacred traditions; he revisits the tragedy of Job and tells us that the most humble of men are Lazare and Cassandra.

Since writing Pelleas, Maeterlinck has never completely written that sentence; he always began it like this: "If I were God..." But now, in his statement at the end of 1936, it is written so clearly: "If I were God, I would put those electors who are introduced to me but do not believe in me in the first row."

Beijing Correspondence

### The Current Literary and Art Scene in Beiping

— Wei Dongming

The editor's letter asked about the literary scene in the north, perhaps mentioned casually, but I am willing to answer carefully and systematically, and also for readers of the "Special Issue" who are concerned about the literary and artistic scene in the north.

The scope of this report is limited to literary and artistic groups and publications, not including the interactions of literati and the lives of writers, etc.

The first literary organization to be mentioned is the Beiping Literary Writers Association, established at the end of last year, which is organized by seventy-odd people who regularly write literary works. They are not all writers; there are professors and scholars, as well as literary apprentices. Because it was a writers' organization, the founding meeting was held in a restaurant. Attendees had to bring a membership fee of one yuan, plus a meal fee of one yuan. Therefore, as far as I know, many people who signed up to join were unable to attend. Seven executive committee members were elected on the spot, and the establishment record and declaration of the association were published in the newspapers the next day. As of now, calculating the work done by the "Writers Association" since its establishment, it has done well in external affairs. Whenever an event occurs, there is always a declaration on the current situation, stating opinions and hopes. In the newly established Beiping Cultural Circles Federation, the Writers Association was also elected to a very suitable position, as an executive member of the Propaganda Department.

In terms of publication, a page of "Literary Weekly" was opened in the early February issue of the Beiping Xinbao, which is considered one of the regular publications of the Writers Association. The Xinbao publishes a large sheet each time; it is the sister newspaper of the Shanghai Zhonghua Daily. It has been welcomed by students from various schools since the 12/9 Movement for sympathizing with the student movement. The "Weekly" has been published in four issues. The third issue is a special issue on the popular literature movement, and the fourth issue is a special page against the "Anti-Mediocrity Movement." The second regular publication of the Writers Association is the "Popular Literature" semi-monthly. It is a small 32-page book, with 50 pages, selling for five cents. This publication was independently prepared as early as November of last year, and it was planned to be managed by a Shanghai bookstore, with the first issue published on New Year's Day this year. However, due to the fussing of the bookstore, the manuscripts had been sent to Shanghai, but no news was received. Now it has been decided to change to publishing in Beiping. Also, because the editors are all members of the Writers Association, it is used as one of the association's publications. The first issue preview has been published in the Xinbao, and it will be released soon.

The publication that is truly independently planned by the Writers Association is the "Northern Literature and Art" large monthly magazine, which is currently in progress. Members donate their salaries to pre-raise the funds for one volume, and at the same time, solicit manuscripts from various sources. This is probably the third regular publication of the Writers Association. According to the person in charge of the publication, the first issue will be able to meet readers as early as the beginning of April.

In terms of research, because there are not many members, and they are scattered in various places, and they are all busy with their own affairs, although they have all selected "groups" to register to participate, including theory, creation, literary history... but not a single discussion meeting has been held.

The second literary organization is the newly established Beiping Literary Youth Association last month. Because the Writers Association cannot allow the majority of people to participate, this Literary Youth Association can indeed make up for the shortcomings of the former. There used to be a Northern Literary Association here, which was a joint organization of literary groups in Beiping and Tianjin. Its work has been suspended for a long time. The difference between the Northern Literary Association and the Literary Youth Association is that the former takes the group as the unit, while the latter takes the individual as the unit. There are also members of the Writers Association in the Literary Youth Association. It also has general affairs, research, and publishing departments. It is also said that it has been decided to publish a large-scale publication.

Next, I want to talk about the scattered literary groups and publications in Beiping. Because there is no bookstore manager, no large readership, and no relatively free market, editing publications in Beiping always involves running to printing houses, peddling to various schools and bookstores, worrying about money and manuscripts, with few sales, and often with the danger of being banned and arrested. Therefore, publications are born and die at any time and cannot last. Publications around the time of the 12/9 Movement, such as "Bubble," were repeatedly hit. It changed once to "Wave," and then to "Today's Literature." Now the main people have joined in editing "Popular Literature." The Literary Guide was published in three issues. Due to internal divisions, the main leader in Shanghai independently organized one issue. The remaining members in Beiping edited two issues, which died together. More recently, "Pomegranate Fire" was published in one issue, renamed "United Literature," and another issue was published. "Literary Land" was published in two issues. The third issue has been previewed in the catalog, but it has not been published for a long time. Recently, some other people have prepared to publish the "Literary Style" monthly magazine.

Beiping is known as a cultural city because of its many schools. Therefore, some literary groups are extracurricular groups of students from various schools. Among them, those that have had performance achievements, at Tsinghua University after the 12/9 Movement, the National Defense Literary Society edited four issues of the National Defense Literary Semi-Monthly, which was half Chinese characters and half new characters. The Tsinghua Literary Society edited three issues of the "New Land" monthly magazine. Later, because the association's affairs were suspended, the publication was also suspended. Recently, Tsinghua students have re-launched the Literary Society, and probably a new coterie magazine will appear with it. Yan Jing University's "12/9 Literary Society" published five issues of "Mars," which was also a small semi-monthly like "National Defense Literature." The University Arts and Literature Society published two issues of University Arts and Literature. The 12/9 Literary Society also continued "Mars" and edited two issues of the medium-sized monthly magazine "Young Writers," because the editors only solicited external manuscripts and separated from the members of the society, they could not get the support of the group.

Currently in Beiping, one is that the semester has begun in various schools, and the other is the spring of the beginning of the year. Literary groups and literary publications are brewing and sprouting. In fact, from the above report, it can already be seen that some literary groups have begun to be active, and many literary publications are preparing to come out. It is expected that the literary and art scene in Beiping this year will be more prosperous than last year.

### “Helplessness”

— Shi Ji

Everyone knows that we live in a society filled with the stench of blood and sulfur. The oppression of imperialism and the darkness of society – these dark words have taken root in people’s hearts, causing anger and helplessness.

“Helplessness” – that expression is naturally too gray, and too oblivious to the people who are actively fighting under heavy pressure. However, at present, when we read in the newspapers about the endless number of people being harmed and insulted, quietly ending their own lives in various ways on the edge of life, or timidly prolonging their ant-like lives by stealing, and finally inevitably going to the tall dark room to spend their unbearable years, when these ordinary and common news items enter our eyes, I always feel a sense of “helplessness” spreading from those so-called “criminals” to myself.

Of course, the feeling of “helplessness” is only felt by the weak. They are dissatisfied with reality, but lack the courage to resist, yet cannot help but continue living. As a result, they can only resign themselves to “helplessness.” However, in this bloody society, what use is “helplessness”? Either quietly commit suicide, or fall into prison. Anger accumulates in the heart, and can only accumulate in the heart for a lifetime.

At this time, benevolence is even more needed, and it is often used as a buffer tool to eliminate resistance. Giving a little benefit to the dying will not only make them grateful as if they were reborn, but also make them the most loyal cattle and horses, continuing to serve. One move accomplishes several goals, and so charitable undertakings are valued. There are also benefits for animals, which seems even more benevolent, but the deeper meaning must also be understood: even animals cannot be subjected to weapons, let alone humans!

However, this intention is ultimately too convoluted and mysterious, and cannot be understood by many. Moreover, once animals are “released,” food must be supplied for a long time. Thus, “the sustainability of daily feeding is a problem.”

Therefore, it is said that “active fundraising is now being planned to maintain it permanently.” It seems that there is also a great sense of “helplessness.”

Is it really “helplessness”? Perhaps it is. Even if we use the best of intentions to measure it, saying that charitable undertakings are the highest expression of human compassion, then passive relief is fundamentally useless in solving the problem. The result is still a case of “helplessness,” and letting useless beasts fill this world and enjoy its fruits, while humans struggle on the line of death, using suicide and prison as their final destination. This is unfair no matter what.

However, will this world always be so “helpless”?

### Toothpicks

— Jia Qian

After a meal, lying in an armchair, preferably one that can rock, I put up my legs, as if a newborn baby were lying in a cradle, except that I am using my own legs to rock my own cradle. In my left hand, I hold a cigarette that has already been half-burned; and my right hand, it doesn't immediately accept the cup of freshly brewed tea brought by the servant – you like it light, and they won't mistake it for "Qimen," otherwise, your family wouldn't even have the name "Longjing" – there is also a most important task, which seems to have been waiting impatiently, forcing your hand to reach out to the other side of the ashtray nearest to you, where there is a magnetic small bottle, with brown rice-colored wooden sticks dressed like flint sticks, which is called a toothpick.

At this point, your back is firmly against the armchair, and your legs are rocking even faster, as if it were an airplane running at full horsepower, your soul perhaps hovering in the clouds; carefully picking out the residue of meat, fish, or various vegetables remaining in your teeth, until your wife warns you that the tea has cooled. But now you need to sip a warm tea, letting the fragrant tea juice caress every picked tooth gap, as if bandaging a wound with a medicinal cotton swab, feeling incomparably comfortable.

That's after dinner, you can unreservedly waste so much time. What about lunch? There are still many jobs waiting for you in the office, so after wiping your face with a towel, you immediately pull out a toothpick to bite in your mouth. Whether walking or taking a car, the time interval is different, the heart swaying like a pendulum, perhaps still struggling with a matter to be resolved in the afternoon – work is really an uncomfortable thing – so you use your special skills to let your front teeth help you pick out those fine bits hidden in your teeth, it will not be clumsier than your hands, and everything you want to do is done for you.

This refers to eating at home. Eating at a restaurant is slightly different. When going to a Western restaurant, or a high-end restaurant, the waiters are specially considerate to customers, and they will never forget the toothpick. The Cantonese restaurants are even more admirable, they prepare for you not wooden sticks like matchsticks, but bamboo ones, strong and tough, not easy to break, and the picking work is naturally more convenient. The word "eating" in Cantonese really refers to the sophistication of Cantonese cuisine, but little is known that even the slightest toothpick is extraordinary. As for if you want to save a little money, go to a small restaurant to eat a 30-cent economy meal, or even eat a bowl of noodles, the toothpick has to be paid for separately. It is not that the thing itself costs that much, but that you have to tip a few extra coins after paying the bill. These few coins can not only get you a few toothpicks, but also see the waiter's smiling face, or even pick a relatively clean face towel and invite you to wipe your face more boldly.

Naturally, using a toothpick is not only limited to eating, it is a habit, it will call you to love and hate, like a woman, you almost have no way to leave it except for drinking tea. And we Chinese people have a special temperament, we like to taste a little when buying things, but the tooth gap does not get blocked because you are tasting, even if you chew a corner of a biscuit, a few hundredths of it is deducted, like paying taxes, immediately making you think of a toothpick. So I really envy some people who value toothpicks as much as banknotes, hiding them in their wallets, so that when paying the bill, can't they just pull out a toothpick to deal with your tooth gap?

Once, I was bored sitting in the dance hall, because I was one of the friends who couldn't dance. Because I was bored, I bought a pack of Weiru's Hong Kong beef jerky to pass the time. When I was eating, I just wanted to pass the time, and didn't think about the tooth gap's customs duty. I didn't have the habit of hiding my wallet, so at this time I found a small bag of toothpicks in the paper bag of the beef jerky. This happiness might be worth more than the China Aviation lottery ticket. I will always remember this food company. I guess that the big merchant who founded the food company will never consider toothpicks to be less valuable than banknotes in his wallet.

### On the Death of He Qihua

— Yunhai

Suicide news is no longer a big deal in Shanghai. Even "family suicide" will only be stimulating for a short time. After a few days, it will sink into silence so quickly that people cannot believe it, forgetting it as if such an event never happened. As for the status of suicide news in the social sections of general newspapers, it hardly occupies an important amount of space. Even a summary of three or four cases in a day is very common. However, recently there has been a very stimulating suicide news item. The content is as follows:

On the morning of the first of this month, just as the auditorium of Great China University was warmly holding the spring commencement ceremony, in the Qunying Dormitory, a student named He Qihua was holding her life's "graduation ceremony." Later, her classmates discovered her, but after transferring her to three hospitals, it was too late to save her and she died. Her death attracted the attention of the entire school, probably because it was clear that the cause of her death was: because of her family's poverty, she was originally unable to go to college. Later, her fiancé Long Zhenzhong supplied her to enter Great China to continue her studies. Recently, school started again, and as usual, a large fee had to be paid. But her fiancé's whereabouts were unknown at this time. Under countless stimuli, she, a poor student named He Qihua, finally handed herself back to herself, and ended her life by swallowing Lysol and water in this way.

Starting on the third day, the newspapers began to publish this ordinary event. However, at least for sensitive young people, and poor students with a "fox mourning for a dead rabbit" mentality, it was very stimulating news. For a time, it aroused infinite sympathy and emotion, but the understanding of this matter was very divergent.

First, most people believe that this news is not as simple as a poor student committing suicide. The main point is that she was "killed by economic coercion." Even more concretely, it is said that He Qihua's death was due to "the current aristocratic educational system forcing her to commit suicide." The main reason for supporting this argument is to list the enormous costs of all school expenses, and to prove it with the current general living conditions. However, there are also people who stand on the opposite side of this argument. They probably have a good impression of the current education system. They are willing to shift the blame to one person, and conservative ideas bind them, so they are unwilling to say anything bad about the current education system. Although these two recognize a great difference, they are still facing this issue head-on, and treating it as a social issue; as for the other type, saying that He Qihua's death is only a wave of love, it is needless to say that such commentators obliterate the facts.

If we can understand this event in more detail, we will certainly not deny that it has nothing to do with the current education system. To say that it is just a love dispute is certainly a poisoning of the truth of the event; but to say that it is a matter of "people," and not the entire educational system, is also a very superficial distortion. As long as a person who has ever knocked on the door of that "school area, idlers are not allowed to enter," whether welcomed or expelled, probably won't not know what that taste is like. If the family is wealthy, needless to say, there is no problem with all of this; if the family is poor, that doesn't matter either, because there is "no door to enter," so you die and give up, so you don't have to worry; the terrible thing is precisely those who can barely study but cannot cope, that's terrible, they can't give up this rare opportunity, but they don't easily get through this life, so after entering the door, they are forced to think of all kinds of ways by that terrible cost. After entering the door? What you see with your eyes, what you hear with your ears, what you feel with every move, are all things that you can't compare with, because you are in this inexplicable misery, and all tragedies are constantly repeating themselves. Therefore, after He Qihua's death, some people loudly cried out in pain: "He Qihua is dead, what about countless living He Qihuas?" This is definitely not a moan without illness. He Qihua's death is worth noting, but it is in this place.

### Hua Jin Sai (3)

— Written by Chen He

One day I met this Master Hong, who loved Jin Sai very much and often accompanied him to drink, so the relationship became increasingly close.

### Hunger

— Lion

This precisely symbolizes the dried-up source of life: that tin box for holding rice has long been empty. Peering inside, it's like the cargo hold of an emptied ship. The kerosene in the Western-style stove is only some residue at the bottom, unable to reach the wick. When cooking rice porridge, cold water is still added to make the kerosene float to the surface, barely managing to half-boil the porridge to fill their stomachs. This bit of practical knowledge only saved Min-sheng and his wife from hunger once. Now, what method is there? Even the cold rice and the kerosene on the surface are gone. Life has been forced to the edge of a precipice.

"Do you think this little bit can be turned into money? Even the secondhand stalls won't take it..."

Min-sheng considers this scolding tone a great humiliation, though he is used to the pawnshop clerks' eyes, more black than white, and their tight-lipped expressions. A few somewhat satisfactory clothes that caught the clerks' eyes were all exchanged for pawn tickets with blue characters and red seals. Now, besides a rusty empty iron jewelry box and a few cloth shirts and pants moved from the high cabinet, there is simply nothing in the chest that can be turned into money.

He has been unemployed for more than three years, relying on his wife weaving socks in a knitting factory to make a living. But she, already five months pregnant, had her wages and "stored work" settled and her employment record revoked on the fifteenth of last month. Their only means of livelihood has also been cut off. Now, Min-sheng and his wife have become two fish left stranded on a bamboo basket. Their only fate is a dried-up "death."

However, the oil in the neighbor's pot is "sizzling" again, and the rich smell of peanut oil flows in through the cracks in the boards, invisibly becoming a threat, a temptation. From experience, he knows it is lunchtime. The sense of smell is particularly sensitive when hungry. The fishy smell of yellow croaker, the fragrant aroma of rice, the sounds of bowls and chopsticks. But no one has come to ask about their lunch, their hunger. Perhaps people in this world are just indifferent to each other, each living their own lives, each family living its own days. The group that is full and the group that is hungry are separated in two worlds, and the space between this world and that world is only a layer of boards, a wall, that separates them. Although thin, those in the hungry world seem to be all mentally deficient, unable to break through this ruthless, cold barrier.

His wife has become a bit abnormal, seeming unreasonable, unable to forgive even a husband who shares her fate. Several times she has said to her husband, slumped in the broken rattan chair: "Losing face, afraid of losing face, are we just going to sit here and wait to die? When our stomachs really can't stand the hunger?... Even if we keep our reputation, what's the use?" As she spoke, her face became even more gloomy.

"Anyone can talk at home, but they also need to understand the difficulties outside, especially when you're poor. You have to be constantly on guard against the sudden attacks of cold words and sarcastic remarks, a look of disgust and contempt. It's not about losing face, but about being terrified. 'Helping the urgent, not helping the poor, saving the tadpole and starving the snake' – I can't blame people for saying these things, but hearing them is more painful than any rebuke or insult. It's not that I'm afraid of losing face, but I'm afraid of losing face for nothing." Min-sheng stood up from the broken rattan chair, still with that puckered, carp-like mouth, still with that trembling stream of sound.

He glanced at his wife's gloomy face and her five-month pregnant belly, then turned his head in distress to look at the "many sons" picture on the wall, covered with a layer of dust. A child? He thought, in this difficult life, even having a child has become a luxury. Then, he thought of the heavier burden of life after his wife gives birth, and couldn't help but quietly lower his head.

The dim sunlight outside the small window shone at an oblique angle on the kerosene stove without kerosene, on the empty tin rice box, so weak and lifeless. The sky also seemed to have jaundice, melancholy on Min-sheng's face, melancholy on his wife's face. They are being tormented by hunger. Today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, how will they get through this long string of difficult days?

### Interesting Stories of Amateur Actors Traveling to Beijing

Last month, the Shanghai Amateur Actors Association performed "Demon of Desire," "Thunderstorm," and "Living in a Drunken Dream and Dying" at the Carlton Theatre. Not only were the scripts, actors, lighting, and sets praised by Chinese and foreign newspapers and magazines and the people of Shanghai, but the box office was also unprecedented. The owner of the China Grand Theatre in Nanjing heard of this and urgently hired people to invite them to Beijing to perform as the opening shot of the theater. The owner had little understanding of spoken drama, so he immediately agreed to the amateur actors' proposal that if sales exceeded 2,000 yuan, they would receive 20% of the revenue. Who knew that on the second day of the performance, sales reached more than 2,349 yuan, and the audience's crowding when buying tickets was unexpected. As a result, one iron gate was crushed and two pieces of glass in the ticket office were shattered. An amateur actor asked the owner, "Are you happy with such great sales?" The owner could only smile wryly and say, "From now on, I will have a deeper understanding of spoken drama."

The Shanghai amateur actors' performance in Beijing coincided with the abolished lunar New Year, so many citizens from Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Longtan, and other areas took boats and cars to see the plays, and the number was countless. Mr. Xu, an amateur actor in charge of selling tickets, happened to be from Suzhou, so he found it difficult to cope with the cries of "Here's a ticket," "This one," etc.

Li Hede, a wealthy businessman from Yangzhou, also led six or seven family members on the third day of the performance, planning to cross the river to see the show. Because they were slightly late for dinner, the ferry had already left. Li was afraid that they would not make it in time, so he urgently hired a special boat to go straight there. After arriving at Xiaguan, he took a traffic bus to the China Theatre. As a result, the "full" sign was already hanging outside the door. Li had no choice but to buy tickets for the evening show. Considering that it would be too late to return home after the show, he opened a room at the Central Hotel. Old Li then made a long-distance call to his home. Mrs. Li calculated that the cost of watching the play "Thunderstorm" had exceeded 100 yuan.

### Silver Flower Petals from Tianyi

Zuo Ming's adaptation of the world-famous "Resurrection" is in progress, and he is currently discussing the plot with the writers and directors.

Chen Yumei, Chen Qixia, and Fan Xuepeng, three major stars, will star in a film separately, and the script is currently being selected.

The comedy "Wealth and Glory" has surpassed expectations and set a new record for domestic comedies.

"Wealth and Glory" has been inspected and approved and will be released at the Jincheng Theater after "Song at Midnight."

"Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money" has been released in other areas first, and the box office is booming. It will soon be released in this area, which is good news for movie fans.

### Lilian Harvey's Another Masterpiece "A Girl from Paris"

Lilian Harvey, the female lead of "Congress Dances", has her new film "A Girl from Paris" having its honorary premiere at the Grand Shanghai Theatre. The play is consistent in a humorous and pleasant melody from the opening to the end. The director's depiction of the personality of the musician reveals genius and bold skills everywhere. The protagonist, Lilian Harvey, was originally a big singer on the American opera stage. Her first song film, "Congress Dances," gave countless audiences the highest praise. In this film, she will show her gifted silver bell-like voice to the public as much as possible. Supporting actors include the handsome Gene Raymond and the slippery comedic actor Mack Otten, among other big stars.

### "Elastic Daughter" in All Shapes and Colors

Xu Su-ling is recuperating at the Red Cross Hospital, and his lover, Lu Ming, is visiting him. The two are talking enthusiastically and seem very intimate. Suddenly, his virtuous wife, Xu Qin-fang, barges in, making Lu Ming feel very embarrassed. After he introduced them, Lu Ming's expression calmed down a little. However, Xu Qin-fang never showed any signs of doubt, a true model of a virtuous wife and loving mother.

Lu Ming is having dinner with Qin Tong, a creditor, at the New Metropolitan Ballroom because of Qin Tong's threats. However, Xu Su-ling, filled with sadness, walks into the ballroom and sees this stimulating scene, misunderstanding that Lu Ming has fallen in love with someone else. On the spot, she spends 200 yuan on dance tickets and throws them in front of Lu Ming, letting out her anger. However, there is one more ready-made saying in the ballroom: "The dragon head can't connect to the trailer."

What is easiest to find in the ballroom are the young masters who claim to be the children of wealthy families. They are always stirring up trouble in the ballroom. In addition to using false love to deceive the dancers, they may even interfere in everything the dancers do. The playboy Ma Loufang in "Elastic Daughter" is a clear example.

The marital breakdown of Zhu Qiuhen and Yu Guang in "Elastic Daughter," the emotional turmoil of Yan Yuexian and Shi Fu, the deep love between Xu Su-ling and Xu Qin-fang, and Lu Ming's wandering on the edge of love all reflect a profound and realistic portrait of dancers who are in contact with the city.
