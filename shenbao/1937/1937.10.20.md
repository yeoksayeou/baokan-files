### Fierce Bloody Battle North of Datong; We Launched a Full-Scale Counteroffensive with Strict Interception

We launched a fierce attack in the Huanggang and Hulizhai areas, gaining the upper hand. The enemy attacked at Yujiazhai and Jixiangzhai in the B line but were repelled. Our air force bombed the enemy positions south of the Wenzaobang Canal last night.

The enemy from Heida Huangzhai to Qiangmentouzhai on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal, after their general offensive on the 12th failed, reinforced and supplemented their forces and launched another attack on the 14th. However, they encountered strong resistance from our army everywhere, resulting in three days and nights of bloody battles. At the cost of 3,000 casualties, they advanced two kilometers south to Gejiapailou. After our counteroffensive, the enemy suffered heavy losses. Both sides advanced and retreated, with extremely heavy casualties. At 1:00 PM on the 18th, the enemy, under the cover of airplanes, artillery, and tanks, fiercely attacked our Huanggang positions. Our army, disregarding their own safety, charged into battle, fiercely attacking the enemy with guns and knives for two hours. Both sides suffered significant damage. However, because the enemy's artillery fire was too fierce, our reinforcements could not arrive in time, so the position was slightly breached. After nightfall, our fresh troops joined the battle and launched several counteroffensives. The fierce fighting continued until late last night (the 19th). At the same time, our army, according to the original plan, strengthened its forces on both flanks, waiting for an opportunity to attack from both sides. The enemy, knowing they could not continue to advance, used all their strength to attack the Liuhang-Datong highway line. Yesterday, all day and night, there were several fierce battles along both sides of the highway, with artillery fire filling the sky and casualties everywhere. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. Although some of our army's positions were breached by the enemy, reinforcements arrived continuously and are currently launching a fierce counteroffensive. According to a front-line report received by this newspaper at 2:00 AM this morning, our army has a significant advantage. The stubborn enemy has penetrated deeply and has been strictly surrounded and blocked by us, and the situation should be resolved within days.

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 10:30 AM on the 19th that the enemy entrenched in Gejiapailou, starting at 1:00 PM on the 18th, used a strong force of 700 to 800 men to fiercely attack Huanggang, which is more than 100 meters away from Gejiapailou. At that time, enemy planes and artillery continuously bombed our front lines. Our army braved the artillery fire and launched an attack, engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The fighting lasted for two hours, and both sides suffered very heavy casualties. Our reinforcements were hindered by enemy planes, making it difficult to advance, so the position was breached by the enemy at one point. After nightfall, our fresh troops joined the battle, greatly boosting morale. After several counterattacks, they were quite successful, and by 2:00 AM this morning, they had approached Fengcuntang. However, the enemy suffered this setback and became extremely panicked, so they launched another large-scale attack. After dawn, under the combined firepower of land and air forces, they attacked us again. Due to the overwhelming momentum, our Huanggang stronghold was eventually lost.

Enemy's Attack on Hulizhai Heavily Obstructed by Us

At the same time, another thousand or so enemies, together with the troops attacking Huanggang, jointly attacked Xihuai, attacking our Hulizhai-Sujiazhai line. Our army was well-prepared, and upon seeing the enemy attacking, immediately bravely met them. One of our brigade commanders directed the battle despite being wounded, and his morale was very high. Although they suffered casualties under the pressure of enemy planes, they continued to fight bravely without retreating. The bloody battle lasted until night, and with the assistance of the rear troops, they launched a fierce counteroffensive, stopping the enemy's advance. As of the time of the company's war correspondent's second report at night, the fighting was still ongoing. Also, the enemy at Bashiqiaozhai was also actively attacking west, so there was all-day fierce fighting at Zhangjialou and Dingjiazhai. However, our army is determined to perish with the position, and will never let them easily gain a single village or a single house.

Our Two Companies Sacrificed at Huangjiazhai

The enemy's objective in attacking south is to capture Datong, in order to attack the flanks of our Miaohang-Jiangwan positions. Their route of attack initially went via the highway, but that failed. Then they advanced to the west of the road, but due to the crisscrossing of ports and rivers, heavy weapons lost their effectiveness, and they suffered heavy losses. Therefore, today they attacked the highway again. First, at dawn, they used about 30 tanks to form a column at Tangqiao, covering the advance of a large force. At about 7:00 AM, they advanced about 800 meters and were driven back by us. The enemy then divided its forces into one part and eight vehicles, attacking our Huangjiazhai to the west of the road and Gaozhenqiaozhai to the east of the road. Our army at Huangjiazhai only had two companies. The enemy avoided the main point and attacked that point with all their strength. Our army still bravely held out for two hours, until 11:00 AM, when they all made heroic sacrifices.

Enemy Continues Southward Advance, Fierce Battle Repelled

After breaking through our Huangjiazhai line, that enemy force advanced again about 800 meters south, attacking our Sujiaqiaozhai to the east of the road. It was also critical at one point, but after reinforcements arrived and fought a bloody battle, the enemy eventually failed and retreated. Also, about 10 enemy vehicles attacked Maqiaozhai, which is about 1,900 meters away from Tangqiao. After we bombarded them with flat-trajectory guns, the enemy vehicles were damaged and also retreated immediately. There was also a force that attacked the Yujiazhai-Jixiangzhai line to the east at about 7:00 PM. Our army launched an attack, and the fierce fighting began. As of the time of the report at 10:00 PM, our army was still holding the original position.

Fierce Fighting in Two Places East of the Highway

East of the highway along the Wenzaobang Canal, the enemy occupied Jiangjiaxinzhai and Yanjiawan and was also active yesterday. The enemy at Jiangjiaxinzhai attacked Zhouchengzhai near the northwest at noon, but their troops were weak, so after our counterattack, they fled in disarray. We intercepted two machine guns and more than 30 rifles. The enemy at Yanjiawan then attacked our Gujiazhai, Yangzhai, and Ziyangbang lines to the east, but there were only a hundred or so of them, and they were no match for our army's attack, so they fled in panic. Looking at the situation of the fierce fighting throughout the day, the enemy's attempt to attack Datong to the south is very obvious. However, we have strong strongholds everywhere, especially to hold the highway line. Therefore, in this area of only 4,000 meters in length and width, the enemy has gathered the strength of more than one division, and after a week of bloody fighting, there is still no progress. Currently, we have completed the deployment of our positions, and we are about to launch a full-scale counteroffensive according to the pre-arranged plan.

### The Enemy Still Attempts a Central Breakthrough, Advancing Towards Our Guangfu Position

We Have Prepared Heavy Troops to Meet Them with a Head-On Blow

The enemy army has been fiercely attacking in the area south of the Wenzaobang Canal, fighting bloody battles for many days, with advances and retreats on both sides. The gain or loss of each village has been more than several times, so both sides have suffered heavy sacrifices. According to those familiar with military affairs, this kind of move by the enemy is actually a feint to the east and attack to the west. The enemy in the Guangfu area, after receiving reinforcements last night, has already begun to fully attack our Guangfu area positions, attempting to achieve their central breakthrough plan. Therefore, they first feign an attack on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal to shift our army's target. Our army has long seen through their plan and has massed heavy troops in the Guangfu area, increasing our strength. If the enemy attacks, we will definitely meet them with a head-on blow.

A Central News Agency war correspondent in Guangfu reported at 9:30 AM on the 19th that the enemy used artillery to bombard our entire Guangfu north-south line of positions in the areas of Laoluzhai, Xinmuqiao, Nanmeizhai, and Wannianqiao. The artillery fire was dense, stretching for more than 2,000 meters. It started last night and only stopped this morning. The enemy's move was to prevent our counteroffensive and to relieve the main force attacking Chenjiaxiang from the worry of being attacked from the rear. Our army saw through their trick, so we are waiting in a strict formation, looking for an opportunity to attack in order to achieve a pincer attack. Also, according to the confession of the enemy lieutenant Weisanlang captured by our army, the enemy who has been fiercely attacking our Guangfu area in the areas north of Guangfu, Nanmeizhai, Beimeizhai, and Tangzhai for many days are the 43rd and 44th regiments of the 11th Division. The enemy in the Xinmuqiao area near Guangfu is the 33rd Regiment of the 9th Division.

### Our Air Force Bombed Wenzaobang

Last night, the blue sky danced with clouds, and the bright moon was clear. Our loyal air force dispatched again to assist in the battle. At 10:30 PM, the sound of planes could be faintly heard in the skies over Shanghai. The enemy ships in the Huangpu River desperately searched with searchlights. However, our air force flew to the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal to bomb the enemy's positions, so they did not approach the Shanghai skies, and the enemy ships did not fire.

### Our Army Attacked Sijing Ballfield

No Contact Continued in Zhabei from Yesterday

A Central News Agency war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 1:00 AM on the 20th that the enemy in the city center remained dormant and did not come out all day. At 5:30 PM, we used a part of our forces, divided from the Municipal Cemetery, Hejiaxiang, and Jiajiazhai, to attack the Sijing Ballfield. The enemy used tanks to cover the infantry to meet the battle. Our machine gun teams then advanced with dense gunfire. After four hours of stalemate, the enemy had more than 150 casualties, but they were still stubbornly resisting. At 11:00 AM, the enemy was finally unable to hold on and retreated to the trenches under the cover of tanks, and fiercely bombarded us with guns and artillery. We scattered in the wilderness, waiting for an opportunity to charge.

A Central News Agency war correspondent in Zhabei reported at 1:00 AM on the 20th that yesterday, on the entire line from the North Railway Station to Bazibqiao in Zhabei, except for enemy planes dropping bombs and occasionally bombarding us with artillery, there was no contact. The Lianglu Administration Building has been the target of concentrated bombardment by enemy artillery and planes since August 13th, leaving it with numerous wounds. At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, it was again hit by an enemy incendiary bomb, and the third floor immediately caught fire and smoked. It was extinguished in the evening, and the body of the building did not collapse.

### Enemy Plane Shot Down in Nanxiang

A Central News Agency war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 10:00 PM on the 19th that at 4:00 PM this afternoon, an enemy plane was hit by our anti-aircraft artillery while dropping bombs in Nanxiang and crashed near the XX Bridge on the XX highway. The fuselage was destroyed, and the crew members were also killed.

### Our Army Absolutely Did Not Use Poison Gas

Our Military Spokesperson Solemnly Denies

Regarding the Japanese side's false accusation that we used a large amount of poison gas on the front lines, our military spokesperson solemnly denied it yesterday at a reception for journalists, saying that since the August 13th Incident occurred, our army has never used poison gas or committed inhumane acts. The spokesperson also said that our army has never even thought about using poison gas to retaliate against the Japanese army's atrocities.

### Sudden Explosion at Tokyo Ordnance Factory

According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of the 8th of this month, at 1:30 AM on the 6th, a fire suddenly broke out at the electric detonator assembly factory of the Tokyo Ordnance Industry Factory at No. 555, 1-chome, Nakadai-machi, Shimura, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, and spread to the detonators, resulting in three explosions, one after another. The sound was heard for several miles, and nearby houses were violently shaken, and the glass windows were all shattered. Residents woke up in shock and were extremely panicked. The factory was founded by Matsukata Goro and was very large, with a total of eight factories, occupying an area of several tens of acres, all of which have been completely destroyed.

### Enemy Ships Bombarded the Riverbank at Baimao

Enemy ships outside Baimaokou suddenly bombarded our riverbank positions again at 3:00 AM yesterday morning (the 19th). Our army waited in a strict formation, but the enemy immediately stopped bombarding and had no intention of landing.

### Vice President Kong Discusses His Impressions of the Mission

Thanking Friendly Nations for Their Kindness; Commending Overseas Compatriots for Their Patriotism — More Than a Hundred Trade Unions Sent Telegrams to Congratulate Kong

Vice President Kong arrived in Shanghai by boat from Hong Kong at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. Yesterday, reporters visited him again and asked him to share his impressions of attending the coronation ceremony in England, inspecting economic construction in various European and American countries, and passing through various places on his return to China. He gave the following statement:

I was ordered to represent our country in England at the coronation of the British Emperor, and took the opportunity to visit various countries to continue the mission of economic construction inspection from five years ago. I was extremely delighted to meet and talk with people from all walks of life in friendly nations. In particular, wherever I went, I was deeply moved by the enthusiastic welcome and sincere hospitality of friendly nations and our overseas compatriots. I deeply understand that such grand reception was given to me not because of personal affection, but because I belong to the most ancient civilized country, which is also recently advancing on the path of construction. Therefore, they showed respect to my country, and I just happened to be present at the occasion. Therefore, I would like to express my personal gratitude here, and also represent the country to pay tribute to all friendly nations.

When I attended the coronation of the British Emperor in England, I deeply felt that the solemn ceremony showed that the United Kingdom has a well-organized government above and a united and consolidated public below, which can integrate people of different races and territories scattered across countries into one, with seamless cooperation. It is fitting that the demeanor of a great power is admired by the world. In France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the United States, and other countries, from government parties to social leaders, all those I contacted expressed goodwill towards our inherent culture and emerging industries. They especially trusted the progress of our country's economic construction in recent years. Therefore, some were willing to cooperate with us in economic affairs, and some were willing to provide us with assistance. All of this has already been seen in the news media and need not be repeated. If such kindness and support can be calmly implemented, the progress of the country will be immeasurable. Unfortunately, we are envied by the enemy, and aggression is imminent. An unavoidable war finally broke out, which affected our construction plans. This is truly heartbreaking. Here, in addition to doing our best to continue progress, we should express our deep gratitude to all friendly nations that cooperate with and assist us economically.

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, I originally intended to expedite my return home, but there were still many international matters that needed to be dealt with, so I could not leave immediately. At the same time, I also believed that the major military and political plans in the country, under the leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, have been arranged properly, and the finance and economy that I am in charge of have also become stable due to the Central Government's active preparations and the people's enthusiastic maintenance in recent years. Moreover, transportation is convenient now, and I can still command and respond calmly from abroad, so I delayed until now before returning. As for the observations of people from all countries on the Sino-Japanese War, there is a definite judgment of right and wrong. However, at first, they were still observing and did not want to express their opinions easily. But in the past two months, on the one hand, our soldiers have been loyal and brave in resisting the war and sacrificing themselves heroically, making the enemy unable to implement their plans and recognizing that we have the ability to regenerate ourselves. On the other hand, the enemy has bombed our undefended cities, brutally killed our non-combatant people, and violated world humanitarianism, so there have been concrete expressions and actions of sympathy and assistance. It can be seen that respecting virtue and loving peace are the natural qualities of human beings. Those who destroy virtue and disrupt peace are the common enemies of mankind. As the saying goes, public opinion is fair. This shows that our ancient sages had the maxim of conquering people with virtue, and Premier Sun Yat-sen left behind the teaching of building the country with peace. Therefore, morality and peace are the basic tenets of our inherent Eastern culture. The Japanese nation has been immersed in Eastern culture for thousands of years, and the majority of their people must respect virtue and love peace. Unfortunately, they are temporarily held hostage by a small number of tyrannical warlords and can do nothing. If all countries that love peace and uphold justice impose effective sanctions on these Japanese warlords who destroy virtue and disrupt peace, it is believed that enlightened people in Japan will also rise up and work for the morality and peace of mankind.

During this return trip, I saw overseas compatriots from all walks of life in Singapore, Manila, and Hong Kong donating to the national cause. In particular, those in the middle and lower classes of industry and commerce are more enthusiastic. Even those who carry burdens on their shoulders donate the entire income of three days to the government. Their patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. Overseas compatriots are like this, so those of us who are born, grow up, eat, and live in this country should know what to strive for.

Yesterday, I arrived in the city from Wusong. Seeing the damage caused by the enemy on both sides of the Huangpu River, I can understand the bloody battles and sacrifices of our patriotic soldiers on the front lines. The damage and suffering suffered by the people in various parts of our rear are truly unbearable to see and sympathize with. However, buying more can beautify our country, and resisting foreign aggression is the only way to survive. Whether our nation and country can stand tall in today's world will be decided in this war. At this critical juncture of life and death, I sincerely hope that the entire country will work together with one heart, with the determination to sacrifice to the end, in order to win the final victory. This will not only save our country, but also preserve virtue for mankind and guarantee peace for the world. The significance is extremely important.

One hundred and seventy-three trade associations in this city, including the silk and satin industry, cotton cloth industry, timber industry, paper industry, national goods rubber industry, pawn industry, inland river shipping industry, rice shop industry, sugar industry, flour mill industry, miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, hardware industry, knitting industry, ginseng and bird's nest industry, new silk industry, pharmaceutical factory industry, color printing industry, wool industry, department store industry, fruit industry, feihua industry, and chemical raw materials industry, sent a telegram of respect yesterday when they heard that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, had returned to China after completing his official duties. The text reads: "Addressed to His Excellency Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan: Your triumphant return is a cause for celebration throughout the country. We admire your outstanding efforts in coordinating and managing finances. At this time when the war is unfolding, the nation's finances depend on your planning, and the industry and finance sector needs more support. Your heavy responsibility and long-term vision are deeply admired. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect. We hope that you will consider it. respectfully, from the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry and 173 other trade associations."

### The Righteous Army Shot and Injured Workers; We Lodged a Second Protest

The first protest's reply from the Italian side was evasive. Mayor Yu Sent Another Letter to the Italian Consul General Requesting a Reply

Regarding the case last month in which the Italian garrison shot and injured workers crossing the Suzhou River, including Cai Zihong, Mayor Yu had lodged a serious protest with the Italian Consul General Neroni, as previously reported. However, the wording of the Italian side's reply was evasive. It is reported that Mayor Yu has lodged a second protest. The full text of the letter is as follows: "Sir Consul, your letter of the 6th of this month has been duly received. However, this Mayor still finds it difficult to accept the various points made in your letter. The reasons are hereby stated again as follows: Upon investigation, the sampan crossing the river at the time was in the early morning, and those on board were all workers commonly crossing the river, who could be easily identified by the guarding garrison. Moreover, the first sampan crossing the river had been allowed to dock. Why was the second group of workers suddenly rejected, causing those crossing the river to be at a loss as to what to do? This point has already been mentioned in this Mayor's previous letter. Furthermore, when your country's soldiers stopped them from advancing, it was difficult for Chinese workers who did not understand your country's language to understand or comply with the orders issued in Italian by your country's patrol. However, the soldier did not use other methods to stop them, but instead opened fire and shot, which was an excessive act and should be held responsible for intentional injury. As for whether your country's soldiers have a treaty basis for exercising their powers in the so-called defense zone, this will not be discussed here for the time being. However, there has been no clear indication of the various restrictions imposed in that area. Even if the workers whose profession is labor have a slight misunderstanding, it is a matter of common sense. Therefore, the claim in your letter that residents in the area were already clear about the crossing points is even more one-sided. The reasons cited in your letter for why your country's soldiers had to open fire are insufficient. Therefore, this Mayor believes that the responsibility for this incident should be borne entirely by your country's soldiers. The two innocent Chinese cannot be blamed. In accordance with the foregoing, I am writing to reply, and I hope that you will refer to this Mayor's letter of the 30th of last month, handle the matter separately, and reply as soon as possible. This is addressed to His Excellency Neroni, Italian Consul General stationed in Shanghai."

### German Residential Buildings Were Destroyed by Enemy Planes; The German Consul Lodges a Protest

German Properties All Displayed Their National Flags; The Enemy Army Disregarded the Facts and Bombed Them

On the 14th of this month (last Thursday), several enemy planes flew to the Hongqiao Road area and indiscriminately bombed it. Four German residential buildings in that area were also hit by enemy bombs. Some of them were partially bombed, and some were completely destroyed. The German Consul General in Shanghai protested to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai for this bombing, pointing out that the German houses in that area all displayed the German flag on the roof, which was very obvious. The Japanese disregarded this fact and bombed them, so the lives and properties of German residents in Shanghai were also threatened. In addition, he also protested to Mayor Yu, saying that the passenger cars parked on the railway near Hongqiao Road were very close to the German houses, thus endangering the properties of the German residents. There was no special military reason for parking these vehicles there, so he specifically asked for attention and to move these vehicles to a place that would not harm the properties and lives of the German residents. According to German sources, the statement made by the Japanese spokesman that this German protest was only submitted to the Chinese side is completely inaccurate. The German Consul General, in addition to lodging a protest with the Chinese authorities, also sent a protest note to the Japanese authorities.

### Northern Shanxi: Our Troops Achieve Victory; Quyang and Fanshi Recaptured

Enemy Troops Launch Fierce Attacks on Us in Three Routes; Tuanchengkou and Dongpaochi Have Been Recaptured; The Enemy's Advance on Jiuguan in Eastern Shanxi is Very Urgent; We Fight to the Death to Resist and Repel the Enemy

[Taiyuan] According to a victory dispatch from the front late on the 19th: ⑴ A unit of our army's eastward advance detachment occupied Pingshan City, on the border of Shanxi and Hebei, on the 17th. Another unit recaptured Quyang City on the 18th and seized 1,000 dan of military grain and a large quantity of military supplies. They are now advancing towards Xinle, Dingxian, and Wangdu. If Wangdu is recaptured in one fell swoop, they can directly threaten Baoding, and the enemy's communication line on the Pinghan Railway will be cut off. ⑵ The right-wing troops of a certain army recaptured Fanshi at approximately 12:00 noon on the 18th, seizing a large quantity of ammunition and military supplies. ⑶ A powerful detachment of a certain unit arrived at Yanmen Pass at noon on the 18th. Within five minutes, 150-160 vehicles traveling south from the north were discovered, fully loaded with enemy infantry, apparently reinforcements heading to the Xinkou area. The detachment launched a surprise attack. The enemy responded in a panic. After half an hour of fighting, approximately 200 vehicles opened from Yangmingbao North, also fully loaded with enemy troops. Seeing their comrades surrounded, they dismounted one after another and launched a pincer attack on our detachment. Subsequently, four enemy aircraft arrived to provide assistance. Our detachment moved nimbly and dealt with the situation calmly. The enemy was exhausted, and suffered heavy casualties. We also destroyed more than 20 of their vehicles. Heavy fighting was continuing as of dusk that day. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 19th)

[Taiyuan] On the 18th, the enemy in northern Shanxi launched fierce attacks on us in three routes. One route, with approximately 1,000 troops, attacked our right flank, but they have already been repelled by our troops. Another route, with approximately 4,000-5,000 troops, launched a sudden attack on our central position. In the morning, they first used heavy artillery to bombard our position, attempting to destroy our fortifications. Our troops responded calmly. In the afternoon, the enemy began to charge into our position with infantry. Our troops jumped out and launched repeated counterattacks. The enemy gradually became unable to withstand the attack and retreated. There was no change in our position. Another route of the enemy, with more than 30 armored vehicles, covered their 3,000 infantry troops, attacking our left flank, with multiple enemy aircraft providing assistance. However, our troops fought bravely and unusually, engaging in a desperate battle with the enemy amidst a rain of bullets. The situation was fierce. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. They are currently still in a standoff. There was also fighting in eastern Shanxi on the 18th. The enemy's attack on Jiuguan was very urgent. A certain regiment of ours resisted to the death, and suffered near total casualties. Subsequently, a division from a certain unit of ours joined the battle, and only then was the enemy repelled.

[Taiyuan] A reporter went to northern Shanxi for inspection on the 15th and returned to Bing [Taiyuan] on the morning of the 19th. The following is a record of the actual situation at the front: ⑴ After our army lost Yuanping on the 11th, we retreated to the new position north of Xinkou and launched a counterattack on the enemy. After fierce battles on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, approximately 6,000-7,000 enemy soldiers were killed. There were only minor engagements on the 16th, 17th, and 18th. ⑵ Our main force is currently still in a standoff with the enemy north of Honggou, north of Xinkou. The left flank is in a standoff with the enemy north of Dabai Shui. The right flank faces off with the enemy across the Yunzhong River south of Lingshan. The enemy has made no progress. ⑶ The fierceness of this battle at Xinkou is unprecedented since the start of the war on the PingSui Line. Both sides occupy high ground and fire artillery at each other. The artillery fire on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th was so intense that there were approximately three rounds per minute on average. ⑷ The commanders at the front in the Battle of Xinkou personally directed and supervised the battle on the front line. Their heroic spirit is deeply admirable. On the evening of the 15th, Hao Mengling, the commander of our 9th Army, along with Division Commander Liu Jiaqi and Brigade Commander Zheng Tingzhen, led the entire army in an attack on the enemy from the left flank. Unfortunately, they were hit by the enemy's heavy artillery on a hillside midway, and heroically sacrificed themselves for the country. ⑸ The actual number of enemy troops near Xinkou is approximately 40,000-50,000, but they have been heavily surrounded in recent days, and with no way out, they are resisting desperately. In order to completely annihilate them, our army has adopted a strangling tactic to prevent the enemy from escaping. ⑹ According to reliable information, the enemy's communications from Nankou to north of Xinkou have been cut off by our army. The enemy is extremely panicked. Large numbers of our fresh troops have arrived at the Xinkou front line in recent days and will launch another fierce attack on the enemy in the coming days. It is expected that the enemy will be annihilated in the near future. The situation of the war is very optimistic. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 19th)

[Tokyo] According to reports received here from the headquarters of the Japanese army in North China, the climate in Shanxi is now severely cold, with snow reaching the ankles, and the mountainous roads are rugged, making it extremely difficult for the Japanese army to move. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)

[Nanjing] Military news: Since the commander of our division, Li Xianzhou, was wounded in the Battle of Nanhuaikou on the 14th, all officers and soldiers of the division have been indignant, and are determined to defeat the enemy at all costs. On the morning of the 15th, they began a fierce attack on the enemy near Xinlianzhuang, Nanhuaikou. The enemy resisted stubbornly. Both sides launched repeated attacks, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. By the evening of the 16th, the enemy's casualties were heavy, and the remaining 300-odd troops retreated to the summit of Lushan. Our officers and soldiers climbed bravely and completely annihilated the enemy. In this battle, over 1,000 enemy soldiers were killed, including over 40 officers from the company commander level down.

### Statistics on Our Schools Destroyed by Enemy Aircraft

[Nanjing] A spokesman from the Ministry of Education told reporters that since the large-scale invasion by the Japanese army, they have bombed our cities and villages, massacred our civilians, women, and children, and have especially wantonly destroyed and harmed schools and students in war zones and non-war zones. According to recent investigations, the following institutions of higher education have been destroyed: Nankai in Tianjin; Hebei Women's Normal College, Hebei Institute of Technology in Hebei; Hebei Medical College, and Agricultural College in Baoding; Tongji, Jinan, Datong, Fudan, Daxia, Shanghai Business College, Law School, Chizhi, Zhengfeng, Southeast Medical College, Tongde Medical College, Music College, Merchant Marine College, and Physical Education College in Shanghai; Central University and Dental School in Nanjing; and Medical College in Nanchang; Zhongshan University in Guangzhou.

It is also reported that while the U.S. aims to mediate the dispute between China and Japan, it will adopt a firm stance. Although the delegates are deeply aware of the daunting task ahead, they are all determined to overcome difficulties and strive for the success of the conference. It is also said that to show the importance he attaches to the conference, President Roosevelt will send a special document to the conference. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull consulted at length today with Davis, the U.S. Chief Delegate to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. He also repeatedly consulted experts familiar with the situation in the Far East regarding the various aspects of the Sino-Japanese War. It is reported that the experts have submitted all relevant economic materials to Davis for detailed consideration, including the potential economic impact should the war prolong and the Open Door Policy be hindered.

[Washington] The Soviet Russian Ambassador to the U.S., Troyanovsky, has been away for a long time. After returning here tomorrow, he will likely discuss the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference with the State Department. The U.S. has played a leading role in convening this conference, so the Soviet Union may express its intention to participate to Secretary of State Hull. It is understood that Hull also supports inviting the Soviet Union, as the Sino-Japanese War affects the Soviet Union the most, aside from China. In the future, the Soviet Union's various commercial, financial, and transportation interests in China may be endangered, so the Soviet Union is very willing to participate in diplomatic negotiations in Brussels. However, if the Soviet Union is invited, Germany also seems to be entitled to the same treatment. On September 19th, Hull stated that the Sino-Japanese issue is a common problem for the whole world. Therefore, the Brussels conference may expand into a world conference. (18th, Guomin News dispatch)

[New York] The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, recently returned to the country for a trip and arrived in New York today. He told reporters that he believes that if democratic countries can unite to resist aggressor countries, they will be able to accomplish the task of creating world peace. However, the concern is that each country wants other countries to come forward as leaders. Regarding recent reports that the Soviet Union has moved aircraft and troops to the Far Eastern border, he said that there is only a feeling of opposition to aggression within the Soviet Union. There are airplanes everywhere in the Soviet Union because we believe it is necessary. The Soviet Union is currently very peaceful, but it is prepared to deal with any eventuality. Soviet industry has made significant progress, and agricultural products have also been harvested. Military and national defense have reached an unprecedented level of strength in the Soviet Union. Troyanovsky also stated that if the Soviet Union is invited to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet Union may send a representative to attend. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters dispatch)

[Rome] Italy has received an invitation from the Belgian government to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be held in Brussels on the 30th of this month.

Foreign Minister Delbos asked him to participate in the French delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference for his expertise, but Sarraut recently took on the additional role of Chairman of the North African Affairs Adjustment Committee and is too busy to spare the time, so he declined. (Central News Agency, 19th, Havas dispatch)

[Tokyo] The Japanese government has not yet received the official invitation from the Belgian government to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It is believed that it will arrive today. According to official announcements, if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, like President Roosevelt's Chicago speech, invites the Japanese delegation as criminals, then Japan will not participate. Conversely, if the countries accept Japan's view that the cause of the Sino-Japanese War is the anti-Japanese movement and red terror, then Japan will send a delegation to Brussels. However, political figures admit that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will absolutely not accept Japan's reasons. (19th, Guomin Maritime News dispatch)

The letter stated that in order to express their sympathy for China, the people of India held a large-scale "China Day" on September 26th. The proposal was made by President Lailu of the All-India Congress Committee. People's congresses and demonstrations condemning Japan's invasion of China were held in major cities and remote villages.

It is said that the content of the talks was not limited to the Spanish situation but also involved the general problems of the Mediterranean. According to Foreign Ministry officials, recent developments in the Mediterranean situation have alarmed both Britain and France. Therefore, Eden and Corbin discussed the following issues: ① the Balearic Islands, ② Spanish Morocco, ③ Italy's troop increase in North Africa, and ④ Arab anti-British and anti-French movements. Regarding the fourth point, the Foreign Ministries of Britain and France both believe that the escape of the Grand Mufti needs to be seriously considered. It is understood that the Grand Mufti fled from Jerusalem to Syria without a passport, but the French mandate authorities have not taken any action so far. The French Foreign Ministry will study this matter in detail and has not yet decided whether to allow the Grand Mufti to continue to reside in Syria. (19th, Guomin Maritime News dispatch)

⊙Naples 2,000 Italian army officers and soldiers boarded the ship Liguria today to go to Italian Libya in North Africa. In the past month, Italian troops have been continuously sent to Libya, and the total number should be around 40,000, so the number of Italian troops stationed there is far greater than the total number of troops stationed in Egypt and French Tunisia. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch)

⊙Jerusalem Riots continue to occur in various parts of Palestine, so the situation is still very tense. All military points are heavily guarded, and the Abyssinians who have come here to take refuge since May of last year have a plan to go to London as a whole. The government is now making every effort to prevent the riots from escalating. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)

[Paris] After fleeing from Palestine, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem has safely arrived in Syria, so the powerful authorities in Paris have discussed this matter but have not made any decision. It is known that after the Palestinian government began arresting Arab leaders, the Grand Mufti fled to the Woma Monastery, stayed for a day or two, and then fled Palestine. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)

⊙Jerusalem According to news received here, the Grand Mufti is now at the Port of Darabula. He originally intended to request to stay in Damascus for a few weeks, but the French authorities did not allow it. It is understood that the Grand Mufti is preparing to go to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to appeal to President Kemal for assistance. If there is no result, he will go to Iraq to seek assistance from the British mandate authorities. The British mandate authorities do not attach much importance to the above activities because they believe that the Grand Mufti's escape from Jerusalem has greatly damaged his prestige among his followers. (19th, Guomin Maritime News dispatch)

⊙Jerusalem The Baharia police station was attacked, and a large number of firearms and ammunition were robbed. The local authorities specially fined Baharia 2,000 pounds and designated an equal number of houses to be demolished. If a gun is returned later, one less house will be demolished. A train from Haifa to Egypt discovered a landmine in the middle of the journey, but fortunately it was not detonated. It is also reported that the members of the Arab Higher Committee who fled to Syria and the Arab nationalists in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon have organized a new Arab Higher Committee in that area. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch) [London] The anti-British movement of Arabs in Palestine continues unabated. Although the local military and police have suppressed it, order has not been restored. This is not unrelated to Italy. News carried by British newspapers in recent days says that the Italian government is now using the Addis Ababa radio station in Abyssinia to broadcast news in Arabic to Palestine for propaganda purposes and will build a new radio broadcasting station and Arab University in Harar, Abyssinia, to engage in anti-British agitation. Regarding this matter, political figures here recently commented that there is no doubt that the Italian radio station is broadcasting in Arabic, and we know it well. However, on the whole, the situation in Palestine is still optimistic. (Central News Agency, 19th, Havas dispatch)

Current Commentary

### The Anti-Japanese Movement in Labor Circles of Various Countries

— Yi

On the eve of the Brussels conference, labor organizations in various countries, regardless of their original colors, are enthusiastically carrying out an anti-Japanese movement. This is very worthy of attention.

According to a recent statement issued by the Executive Committee of the British Trades Union Congress, the trade unions of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the Australian Federation, Mexico, India, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Ireland have unanimously expressed their approval of the resolution previously passed by the Executive Committee of the British National Labor Movement condemning Japanese atrocities and advocating a boycott of Japanese goods and have all decided to implement a boycott of Japanese goods. Also noteworthy is that the two major labor organizations in the United States, the Labor Federation and the Industrial Organizations Committee, have historically been at odds and engaged in fierce struggles. Recently, in addition to passing resolutions to condemn aggressor countries, there is also a tendency for joint action for world peace.

The aggressive actions of international gangsters endanger world peace. If the people of various countries do not use effective methods to curb them but allow them to spread, then no corner of the world can avoid war. This is a common feeling among people of all levels in various countries, but the labor class, because it has less direct interest and less to worry about with aggressor countries, is the first to take steps to strike at international gangsters.

The high tide of the anti-Japanese movement in labor circles of various countries obviously has a great effect. It goes without saying that our enemies will therefore suffer a serious blow economically. At least the element of indulgence and accommodation to international gangsters in the diplomatic policies of various governments can now be expected to be reduced somewhat.

### Siblings Save on Food and Clothing to Comfort Soldiers

The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association received 100 yuan in national currency from Shen Maolan and her four siblings from Cangqian Mountain in Fuzhou, who identified themselves as "little citizens." They specified that the money be used to comfort the brave and loyal soldiers fighting in the war. The original letter stated: "Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the soldiers defending the country at the front have bravely fought the enemy, breaking limbs and bones, and making heroic sacrifices. We five siblings, although underage, cannot help but feel grief and indignation whenever our family members talk about the various situations of the wounded soldiers. Therefore, we have decided that we will not buy new clothes or eat fruits and pastries this year, and we have obtained the consent of our parents to allow us to pre-spend 20 yuan per person from the saved funds to comfort our brave and loyal wounded soldiers fighting in the war. A drop in the bucket, but we are doing our best. We are sending 100 yuan in national currency, please check and forward it to the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association. Sincerely, Shen Maolan, Maofang, Maofu, Maoqing, No. 4 Heling Road, Cangqian Mountain, Fuzhou." The association issued a receipt and replied with a letter of thanks.

### British Scouts Express Deep Sympathy to Us

The brutal Japanese invasion of Shanghai and our army's vow to fight to the death have won considerable international sympathy. Boy and Girl Scouts in this city have risen up to serve, engaging in relief and rescue work in the front and rear.

### National Labor Council Implements Effective Sanctions Against Japan

Reply to Zhu Xuefan's Telegram

Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and candidate for the International Labour Bureau Council, recently telegraphed the International Labour Bureau Council in Geneva and the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions, requesting the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan to curb Japanese atrocities and maintain peace in East Asia. Mr. Quan received a reply telegram yesterday, stating that effective methods have been adopted to implement sanctions. The original telegram is recorded below:

International Labour Bureau Council's Reply Telegram

We have now telegraphed the 51 national federations of trade unions under the leadership of the International Federation of Trade Unions to fulfill their obligations, stop Japan's illegal activities in the Far East, and do their best to assist the League of Nations in taking the most effective measures to curb further inhumane acts by the violent Japanese in China. Respectfully,

### Insulting Newspaper's Dishonorable Character Demands Punishment

Named "New Shenbao" but the Content is Base and Sordid – Fabricated Absurd News is Not Worth a Laugh

Yesterday, the Continental Daily News reported that some Japanese reporters in this city who had studied Chinese during their school days are now devoting themselves to editing a Chinese newspaper named "New Shenbao." The reason for using this name is to imitate the oldest and most widely sold "Shenbao" in China. Although the text tries to take a Chinese stand, the lines are full of forced tones written by Japanese people. The most conspicuous thing is that its distribution office is located at No. 455 Zhapu Road, Hongkou, telephone number 4867. In other words, the newspaper is printed by the Japanese "Shanghai Daily News" newspaper office, and the editor is probably a member of that newspaper office. The cover states that it is published daily and sells for three cents. However, Shanghai newspaper stands do not sell this newspaper, so it is only mailed to some Chinese shops and individuals. The news column contains various fabricated news. (The translator notes that the Japanese are extremely rogue and repeatedly make shameless moves. They have not only scattered dog-shit-incomprehensible Chinese leaflets in buildings, but also compiled and printed this kind of Chinese newspaper full of nonsense, using base and sordid actions to incite our compatriots and end the war as soon as possible. This is enough to reflect their predicament. It should be known that today our compatriots are united in spirit and share the same hatred of the enemy. Nothing can shake them. Hearing this rabid barking will only strengthen their determination. If the enemy were in a position to win, they could safely wait for the victory on the battlefield and would never engage in such ugly behavior to be laughed at by the world. However, since it is mailed to various places, it is hoped that the postal authorities will pay attention to it.)

### Contributing Wartime Opinions, Pay Attention to Three Points

Wartime Opinion Collection Office Hopes That All Suggestion Makers Will Comply

Since the establishment of the Design Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, a Public Opinion Collection Office has been set up to gather opinions from all sources. The temporary communication address is Room 508, Zhonghui Building, Edward Road. Dozens of opinions are received daily. According to the person in charge of the office, the association has received more than 490 suggestions from various parties, all of which have been approved and adopted. However, please pay attention to the following three points in the future: ㊀ The suggestion makers often do not want to state their names and addresses, so that the association cannot reply to the results. ㊁ When suggestion personnel offer opinions, they hope to talk less about theory and focus more on facts, so that each problem has concrete solutions listed. ㊂ The association has always replied to the suggestion makers' letters after receiving them, and then reviewed and forwarded them to the relevant parties for reference. However, whether they are adopted and processed, the association will inform the suggestion makers after receiving a reply from the relevant agencies. Please do not come to the association to inquire. In addition, the association has set up a special talent registration office in response to wartime needs. The temporary registration location is No. 20 Xifuyuan Lane, Jiaozhou Road, Roberts Road. Anyone with special skills who has not registered with various agencies and groups in this city can go to the registration location to collect a form and register.

### Admiral Little Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday on His Flagship

British Far East Naval Commander Admiral Little has completed his inspection of South China and returned north from Hong Kong on his flagship HMS Kent. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but it was delayed en route and only entered the port yesterday morning. At about 8 o'clock, he disembarked at the Xin Guan Wharf by launch and returned to his residence for rest.

### American Transport Ship Carries American僑 Away from Shanghai

The American transport ship Chaumont arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines a few days ago. The ship is scheduled to carry 60 American僑 away from Shanghai tomorrow (the 20th), passing through Qingdao and Yantai to Kobe, and then transferring to a Dollar Company ship to return to the United States.

### North China Youth Tragically Captured and Killed by Enemy Troops

Yanjing University Students Also Arrested, Fate Unknown

According to a person in charge of the Shanghai-Tianjin Alumni Association, the pressure exerted by the Japanese on students trapped in the Tianjin area has intensified in recent times. All middle schools have been forced to start classes and receive indoctrination. It is recently heard that Tsinghua and Peking Universities will also start classes, and a large number of students will be transferred from the puppet state of Manchuria to Tianjin. On the other hand, students from various schools are arrested and go missing almost every day. Recently, Yanjing University was also searched, and 28 students were arrested in one swoop. Their fate is still unknown. The school's president, American Stuart Leighton, has negotiated with the Japanese embassy, but to no avail. (Japanese officials told Stuart that under the sun flag, the Japanese military authorities have the right to dispose of people of any country, especially since the Yanjing students are Chinese. Their tyranny is such.) Yanjing, which is generally considered a relatively safe place, is like this, so one can imagine what it is like elsewhere. The people in Beijing are now panicked, and students risk dressing up and going south, one after another. Shipping between Tianjin and Shanghai is intermittent. Recently, a large number of students have come to Shanghai, and we are afraid that they will not be well received. We are publicly soliciting again, hoping that students who come to Shanghai will register with the association to connect with each other and jointly engage in national salvation work. The association is scheduled to hold its second general assembly at 2 pm on the 24th to intensify its work.

### Military Commission Commends Cilian Disaster Relief Association

The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Disaster Relief Association established the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee immediately after the outbreak of the Shanghai war and handled the reception and repatriation of refugees with extraordinary efforts. Until recently, there were still more than 30,000 refugees in the various shelters. The association submitted a report on its work to the Military Commission a few days ago and received a reply from the Military Commission yesterday commending it. The letter stated: "We have forwarded your association's letter and attached report of this year's upper month 4th to the committee. Your association's relief efforts for wounded soldiers and victims are well-planned and effective, and have greatly benefited the country. We deeply admire you. Sincerely, Military Commission."

### American Women's Community筹办 Children's Hospital

Specializing in Adopting Sick Children from Various Shelters After the Weather Cools, Many Refugees in Various Refugee Shelters in This City Suffer from Diseases, Especially Children Aged One to Three, Because There is Little Milk and No Way to Take Care of Them. According to a Recent Survey by Charity Organizations, Statistics from Various Shelters in Recent Days Show That More Than 200 Children Die Every Day Due to Illness. This is Only One Aspect of the Lack of Nutrition Among Children. The American Women's Community in Shanghai Recently Held a Meeting to Discuss筹办 a Children's Hospital Dedicated to Adopting Children From the Time They Are Born Until They Are One Year Old for Relief. Everyone Was Impressed by the American Women's Community's Enthusiastic Relief Efforts. The Health Bureau is Also筹设 a Similar Hospital Dedicated to Adopting Children From One to Five Years Old. Children Over the Age Will Not Be Adopted. This is Truly Good News for Refugee Children. However, Because Funds Are Needed Everywhere, It is Hoped That All Sectors Will Find Ways to Donate.

### Coming and Going in Bombing Raids

— Guo Moruo

XI

I accepted ×××’s dinner invitation for the evening, with Chunru as a fellow diner.

Although ×× and I had only met twice, we were already like old friends of many years. We spoke frankly about everything and did not feel the need for any polite formalities. His physique was very robust. At first, I thought he was a purely exemplary soldier, but his interest in literature was extraordinarily deep. During this second meeting, he spoke of Yu Dafu, Mao Dun, and even Yun Daiying. He said that Daiying was not only good at giving speeches but also at writing articles. It was a pity that he died early, otherwise he would be active again now.

The conversation turned to the enemy’s bombing of Nanjing. The enemy had declared long ago that there would be a large-scale bombing of Nanjing after noon on the 21st, and asked diplomatic personnel and residents of all countries to withdraw. This clumsy and violent declaration revealed the Japanese’s “bully the weak, fear the strong” attitude of currying favor with superiors. The Chinese are easy to mess with, and it doesn’t matter if tens or hundreds of thousands are killed. But foreigners are not to be trifled with. The Japanese are dwarves in front of foreigners, and they are fearsome giants in front of the Chinese. This is their “Bushido.” Bullshit.

—However, we welcome the enemy’s planes coming to attack the rear, because that can reduce the suffering of our soldiers at the front and increase our hatred of the enemy in the full-scale war of resistance. This was the opinion expressed by ××, and these words deeply moved me.

The victory at Pingxingguan was also reported by ××. I had heard people talking about this news early in the afternoon, but everyone was still skeptical. This time it was confirmed. However, the details of the battle and the participating troops had not yet been clearly reported.

After dinner, I said to Chunru: I plan to return to Shanghai in a day or two, because there is some important work that I must take care of.

Chunru said: Cars are convenient and can be set off at any time. He also said that he also wanted to go to the front to visit his family and had already telegraphed the front for instructions. He would probably get a reply tomorrow.

So we agreed to leave Nanjing at about three or four o'clock tomorrow afternoon, if all the circumstances permitted.

Having decided to rush back to Shanghai, it was necessary to report to Mr. Chiang first. After leaving ××’s branch office, I went to visit Zhang Yuejun again and asked him to convey my message to Mr. Chiang. At the same time, I also told him about Mr. Chiang’s conversation with me and reiterated my personal wish not to accept the title.

Yuejun replied that he would convey everything for me. He asked me: Do you still want to see Mr. Wang?

I said: I am very willing, as long as Mr. Wang has a convenient time.

Yuejun immediately called Mr. Wang and arranged to meet him at a certain place at nine o’clock tomorrow morning. At the same time, he inquired in detail about the news of the victory at Pingxingguan that I had told him.

The victory was indeed large-scale, killing 3,000 enemies, capturing 2,000, and seizing countless enemy military supplies. The participating troops were the Eighth Route Army. The battle was fought by first using a battalion of men to harass the enemy's rear, luring them to a mountain valley where there was an ambush, and annihilating them in one fell swoop.

Truly delightful. If this were ten years ago, upon hearing such news, I would have downed a large bottle of brandy.

### American僑 Affected by the Shanghai War Suffer Losses of Four Million Yuan

Tobacco Leaf, Oil, and Paper Merchants Suffer the Most – Dollar Company's Losses Are Also Significant

During the Shanghai war, the losses of American僑 in this city, as of now, have been reported to the American consulate by ten companies. The losses suffered by tobacco leaf merchants, oil merchants, and paper merchants are the largest, with a total estimated at at least four million yuan. As for indirect losses, since Dollar Company stopped its Shanghai route, American imports have almost disappeared, and exports such as tung oil, which is the raw material most welcomed by the United States, cannot be transported either. The losses in the past two months have been enormous and difficult to calculate for the time being.

### Yarn Factory Workers' National Salvation Association Sends Female Workers to the Soviet Union

It is Learned That the Shanghai Yarn Factory Workers' National Salvation Association Has Reached an Agreement With a Certain Factory in Suzhou to Send 500 Female Workers to Work.

It is Also Learned That the Association Plans to Send People to Suzhou Immediately to Discuss All Issues Concerning the Workers' Treatment. All Yarn Factory Workers Should Register With the Association at No. 24 Fuxing Village, Jiaozhou Road Immediately.

### First Aider Song Shujun Dies From Overwork

Song Shujun, a member of the Eighth First Aid Team of the Shanghai First Aid Committee, worked day and night at the front line to rescue wounded soldiers in the hail of bullets, without fear of danger, and rarely rested. He finally fell ill from overwork and died on the morning of the 18th of this month. It is said that his funeral was quite desolate.

### Service Groups Seeking Members

The Shanghai Patriotic National Salvation Propaganda Group, organized by a group of enthusiastic young people, has been established for more than a month. Its work is to sing and perform at wounded soldier hospitals. The work has been intense in recent days. Now, because the original members are insufficient, it is specially publicly recruiting male and female members. Anyone who is slightly interested in drama and singing can register at No. 59 Peide Lane, Datong Road, from the 20th to the 25th of this month. The Hongkou Track and Field Team, in order to summon members to participate in wartime service, will process registrations from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm every day from today until the 22nd at Zheng Zhichao's place, No. 91 Mingde Lane, Fuxu Road, in order to allocate work.

### Announcing Japan's Breach of Treaty and Aggression Against China

— Zhang Zhirang

Our nation submitted a petition to the League of Nations on September 12th. On the 15th of the same month, Chief Delegate Gu Weijun declared to the General Assembly of the League of Nations, hoping to announce Japan as an aggressor nation. Although the League of Nations has not yet made such an announcement, in the General Assembly on the 6th of this month, when it passed the resolution to convene the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it also passed a factual report which clearly pointed out that: Japan's military actions against China with its army, navy, and air force cannot be justified as necessary self-defense. Furthermore, there is no basis to verify the claim of self-defense. Therefore, these actions are in fact violations of the obligations it bears under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The British Foreign Office also issued a statement on the same day, stating that Japan's actions in China are inconsistent with the principles of international relations and violate the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The conclusion reached by the US government is the same as that of the League of Nations General Assembly.

What difference is there between such a determination and determining Japan to be an aggressor nation? An aggressor nation or a war of aggression is merely a concept. Regardless of what definition it should adopt, conducting military actions against another country illegally will inevitably be included within the scope of this concept. It's like determining that a person has indeed illegally caused another person's death, and directly calling him a murderer. Aside from the different wording, there is no difference. Therefore, the League of Nations and the United States' determination of the aforementioned facts is tantamount to announcing Japan as an aggressor nation - when the question of whether Japan is an aggressor nation must be answered, they can have no other answer unless they overturn their previous statements.

Such a determination by the League of Nations and the United States has a tremendous impact - it determines the legal, political, and moral standing of the member states of the League of Nations and the United States regarding the Sino-Japanese War, points out the path that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should take, and suggests the matters that our country should implement at present.

Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates: Member states of the League of Nations undertake to respect and preserve against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. Article 11 stipulates: Any war is considered an event of concern to the entire League, and the League should take appropriate and effective actions to safeguard international peace. Article 16 stipulates: Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under the provisions regarding arbitration, judicial settlement or enquiry, such action shall ipso facto be deemed to be an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not. Article 17 stipulates the procedures that should be followed when the above provisions apply to non-member states. These are the obligations borne by member states of the League of Nations when a war occurs - they should implement economic and military sanctions against the aggressor nation, and mutually assist each other under certain conditions. The United States, although not a member of the League of Nations, is a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This pact formally declares the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another, and stipulates that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means. Under this pact, Japan bears the obligation not to engage in war towards other signatory countries, including the United States.

Now Japan is engaged in war against China. Whether it has a reason or not, it is violating the obligation not to engage in war for signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and it has triggered the reasons for imposing sanctions for member states of the League of Nations. This is based solely on the Sino-Japanese War itself. If we further discuss the situation created by its past military actions, then it has also violated, in particular, the obligation of respecting the territorial and administrative integrity of China for the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. Under such circumstances, the member states of the League of Nations and the countries that signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty - especially those that participated in the Brussels Conference - bear certain responsibilities in law and morality.

From a passive perspective, they can no longer have the possibility of declaring neutrality regarding China's resistance, no matter what happens in the future - the American Neutrality Act has no reason to be implemented. This is because member states of the League of Nations already have the obligation to impose sanctions against Japan, and signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact have already discovered that Japan is engaging in the behaviors that the pact rejects. Strict adherence to neutrality is a method of treating the perpetrator and the victim equally, so it is not only morally unacceptable but also prohibited by the aforementioned covenant and pact. Not only that, the resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly on the 6th of this month has already stated clearly that the General Assembly expresses spiritual assistance to China, and suggests to all member states to refrain from all behaviors that would weaken China's resistance and consider the extent to which each country can individually assist China. US President Roosevelt also stated in his speech on the 5th of this month that countries infected with the epidemic of disregarding the law should be forcibly quarantined. The State Department also invoked President Roosevelt's speech the next day, advocating that international treaties must be respected. Therefore, it is very obvious that they no longer have the possibility of maintaining neutrality.

From a proactive perspective, we can - and should immediately - advocate to the countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference that they impose economic, military, and other sanctions against Japan. Although the United States is not bound by the League of Nations Covenant, it also has the responsibility to use effective methods to forcibly eliminate the behaviors rejected by the pact, and military sanctions are the most effective of these methods.

Even if we take a step back and do not propose military sanctions as the first step, we should at least advocate that all countries immediately sever economic and diplomatic relations with Japan. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also issued a statement on the 6th of this month explaining President Roosevelt's method of forced quarantine, also advocated that countries around the world should reject Japan and refuse to interact with it, which is what I am stating here.

It seems that no one can deny that our country should present the above claims to the countries concerned. So, before making this proposition, what should our country do? If we ask others to take one step, we should at least take three steps ourselves. We cannot fail to first sever our own economic relations with Japan while advocating to others to implement economic sanctions; similarly, we cannot fail to first sever our own diplomatic relations with Japan while advocating to others to sever diplomatic relations with Japan. Therefore, before the Brussels Conference is convened, our country should quickly implement the following actions against Japan: ㊀ Recall all personnel of the embassy in Japan and all consuls; ㊁ Announce the invalidation and suspension of treaties and stop paying the principal and interest on foreign debts; ㊂ Confiscate public property of enemy countries in China and refer to the precedent before World War I and the examples during World War I to stipulate measures for handling private property of enemy country nationals in China; ㊃ Refer to precedents before and during the Great War to stipulate how to deal with enemy country nationals in China; ㊄ Prohibit trade with the enemy and sever all economic relations. This will externally demonstrate our country's long-held determination to burn our boats, which we have already had subjectively. Finally, our country should also declare as early as possible: Our country participates in this conference convened because Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, with a belief - this belief is that countries will never violate the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty regarding respecting our country's territorial integrity and the principles of justice and fairness, and propose methods of mediation.

### The Enemy's Attempt to Invade Dachang Fails - Our Elite Troops Are Triply Flanking

The Enemy's Four Fierce Attacks on Sujiazhai Were All Repelled - The Enemy in the Huanggang and Hulizhai Areas Were Besieged by Us - We Still Hold the Yujiazhai and Chenjiazhai Positions

This newspaper received the following front-line war report this afternoon. From last night to 10 AM this morning, the focus of the battle north of Dachang was still on the two lines on the left and right of Yujiazhai on the Shanghai-Tai Road, especially the area from Gejiapailouzhai to Sujiazhai west of the highway. The enemy's purpose was to charge directly at the front of Dachang along the highway with tanks, and to attack Xiaochiyuan and Sujiazhai with the main force, attempting to break through the highway between Dachang and Nanxiang and compress the rear of our army. Therefore, after the enemy troops broke into Gejiapailouzhai, they again, starting from dusk yesterday, gathered a large number of strong and stubborn infantry, and under the intense fire of their artillery, launched a fierce attack on our Sujiazhai and Xiaochiyuan positions from the Huanggang area, aggressively advancing in a wedge-shaped formation. Our army believed that this road was related to the gain or loss of Dachang, so it dispatched elite troops to encircle the enemy on both the left and right wings, and jointly attacked with the front of Sujiazhai. An unprecedented bloody battle immediately began. Up to 8 AM this morning, the enemy troops charged four times, and our army fought on three sides, advancing wave upon wave, with no retreat. Therefore, the enemy troops repeatedly charged fiercely, but were all severely attacked, and retreated with more than half of their casualties. Our side also suffered considerable losses. The enemy finally retreated to the Huanggang and Hulizhai areas after suffering heavy casualties at 8 AM this morning, and was surrounded by us on three sides. Because the enemy knew that our side would inevitably counterattack on this line, and was stationed with heavy troops, it hurriedly built fortifications near Gejiapailouzhai. Also, the enemy in the Huangjiazhai area on the front of the highway yesterday used 30 tanks to cover the large team of enemy soldiers, divided towards the southeast Sujialinzhai and Yujiazhai our army positions, and violently attacked, and there were many enemy aircraft bombing. At that time, our rear reinforcements could not catch up due to the enemy's excessive fire density, resulting in a breakthrough in a part of the position. After dusk, our army began to counterattack in separate ways, fighting bloodily all night. Three of the enemy's tanks were destroyed by our mortars, and they collapsed and retreated north of Huangjiazhai before dawn this morning. From dawn to 10 AM, the enemy did not dare to attack, and our army still firmly defended the front line north of Yujiazhai and Chenjiazhai along the Shanghai-Tai Road. Chenjiaxiang is still in the hands of our army, and the previously breached position has also been restored. The northern part of the area from Dunwu Temple to Caijiatang has also been retaken. Last night and this morning, the enemy continued to send small troops to disturb and contain our army, but our side was stationed with elite troops, and the enemy's attempt would never succeed. The enemy on the front of Guangfu Town did not attack yesterday or today. However, the enemy artillery team in the Liuhang area occasionally bombarded our side, and our army remained unmoved. Our army west of Luodian still firmly defended its original position, and there was no change. There was a small conflict northeast of Miaohang last night. The enemy artillery fired once every two to three hours, but when their small number of infantry came to attack, they immediately retreated once our army launched an attack. On the Jiangwan to Zhabei line, both sides took a defensive posture, and there was no fierce battle yesterday or today.

On the line west of the Shanghai-Tai Road on the south bank of the Yunzaobang, between Huanggang and Sujiazhai, our enemy and our side have now launched a major battle. The situation of this battle has the possibility of completely breaking the enemy's attempt to attack Dachang. Our forces are strong and our positions are solid near Dachang, and there is absolutely no need to worry about Dachang. At the same time, some people are worried that the situation in Dachang is tense, fearing that the Zhabei to Jiangwan line on the right wing will also be withdrawn. According to our military authorities, this is absolutely irrelevant. Even if Dachang cannot be defended, Zhabei will also maintain the current situation, firmly defend and resist, and never give up. In fact, the enemy's attack on Dachang is only a dream.

### The Enemy at Gejiapailou is Surrounded and Attacked by Our Forces

We Assault the Enemy's Left Flank from Maqiao, Causing Instability in the Enemy's Rear

Since the battle at Gejiapailou Mansion, after suffering heavy losses from our forces, the enemy has been urgently reinforcing, hoping to fight to the death. However, our large army is concentrated on that line, fearing nothing. Fierce battles have unfolded in recent days. The density of artillery fire and the intensity of hand-to-hand combat have been unprecedented. The enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses, with corpses lying everywhere and blood splattering the fields. Although our army has suffered considerable sacrifices, our positions are consolidated and have not been taken by the enemy. Therefore, the enemy is at a loss. Fearing the danger of being deeply isolated, they shifted troops to the east, attempting to sneak attack our Jixiangzhai area to reverse their isolation. Unexpectedly, they were again severely attacked by our forces. Currently, with the help of reinforcements from their rear, the enemy hopes to come back with renewed ferocity and probe towards the Jixiangzhai and Gejiapailou areas. At times, the enemy's air force also comes out to assist in the battle. Our army, fully aware of their plans, in addition to directly and fiercely suppressing them from the front, has dispatched heavy forces from the Maqiao and Yujiazhai areas to attack the enemy's left flank, successfully surrounding and outflanking the enemy's rear advancing towards Gejiapailou. Therefore, the enemy's rear in the Gejiapailou area has been destabilized. At the same time, our heavy forces on the Huli Village and Zhangjialou lines are also responding with a pincer attack. Consequently, the enemy's main force is now surrounded by our forces.

A correspondent from the Central News Agency with the army in Jiangwan reported at 12:40 PM on the 20th: Since the fighting on the south bank of the Wenzaobang shifted to the highway line, the enemy has been using tanks to rush south from Tangqiao. Fierce fighting occurred all day at Maqiao Village, where they suffered a strong blow from our forces. After having three tanks destroyed by us, realizing they could not succeed, they immediately retreated. At night, the fighting at Shengjiazhai and Huli Village became even more intense. The enemy attacked west from Huanggang and Gejiapailou, but also encountered severe resistance. Our army firmly defended its original positions, never yielding slightly despite being under artillery fire and a rain of bullets. On the eastern end of the highway, along the bank at Shenjiawan, Luzhai, and Gaorenqiaozhai, the enemy's fierce attacks failed. Therefore, starting last night, they again bombarded heavily with artillery for a long time, and their troops made several attempts to attack. However, each time we met them with a head-on assault, driving them back. Our current defense line on the south bank is exceptionally solid. From Shenjiawan, Luzhai, Gaorenqiaozhai, and Sujiaqiao Village east of the highway, extending west across the highway to Jixiangzhai, Chenjiazhai, Yujiazhai, and as far as Huli Village and Shengjiazhai, all important strongholds are closely connected, as solid as a rock and as secure as a fortress. Fresh troops are also positioned and ready, and have begun a counter-attack. Starting this morning, the sound of artillery has gradually moved further north.

### A Large Batch of Enemy Reinforcements to Arrive in Shanghai

Aiming to Seize the Area within the Former Shanghai Demilitarized Zone Before the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

In order to divert international attention and restore national prestige, the Japanese side intends to conquer the non-garrison area within the former Shanghai Demilitarized Zone before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 30th of this month. Therefore, they have additionally transferred more than three divisions of troops from the Ministry of the Army, approximately 50,000 soldiers, to Shanghai to participate in the war. It is reported that this batch of reinforcements will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th.

The enemy, Hasegawa, convened a meeting at the Japanese Club on Hongkou Pong Road on the morning of the 17th, attended by more than 20 people, including Harada, Okawa, Uchio, Tamatsu, and military commanders. The content of their discussion included: ⑴ the concentration points for military forces in this campaign; ⑵ defense strategies against our army's air raids; ⑶ the need to actively occupy Dachang and other plans.

Shimizu, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China, left Shanghai and returned to Japan on the 13th of this month. Before his departure, he contacted the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France before proceeding. It is rumored that Shimizu's mission in returning to Japan is largely related to the establishment of a neutral zone in Shanghai.

### Enemy Warships Again Shell Pudong

Covering Enemy Vessels Stealing Fuel

An enemy warship anchored at buoy number nine suddenly opened fire on our Pudong at around 8:00 AM this morning (the 20th), bombarding it heavily. At the same time, three other small enemy vessels slowly approached the New Mitsui Wharf in Pudong, attempting to land and steal fuel from the coal depot there. Our defending troops, aware of their trickery, ignored the enemy warships' shelling and waited quietly for the small enemy vessels to get close to the shore. Then, they unleashed a concentrated barrage of machine gun fire. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy troops scurried away in panic, but more than a dozen of them were shot and killed or wounded.

### Further Report on the Downing of an Enemy Plane in Nanxiang

Crashed at Yangliu Bridge, Both Plane and Crew Burned

The downing of an enemy plane by our forces in Nanxiang was reported in this newspaper this morning, but the detailed situation was unclear. Now, according to a telegram from the Central News Agency in Suzhou on the 19th, we have learned the exact location of the crash. Details are listed below: At 4:30 PM on the 19th, six enemy light bombers flew to the Nanxiang Malu Town area, wreaking havoc. One of them was shot down by our anti-aircraft artillery and crashed at Yangliu Bridge, both the plane and its crew burned. One machine gun was recovered. Three other planes were damaged by our anti-aircraft artillery, and the remaining planes, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled eastward in panic.

### Enemy Supplies Concentrated in Hongkou

The Hongan-ji Temple on Zha Pu Road Stores Large Quantities of Munitions and Artillery Positions. A High Tower Built Inside a Girls' School on Shigaota Road Serves as the Hongkou Headquarters.

According to reliable information, the Hongan-ji Temple on Zha Pu Road in Hongkou (a Japanese Buddhist temple) is one of the enemy's important military institutions. There is an underground tunnel beneath the main hall of the temple, storing large quantities of munitions. 300 artillery soldiers are stationed there, with two heavy artillery positions. Two anti-aircraft guns and two anti-aircraft machine guns are installed on the roof. Furthermore, artillery positions are also established at the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company on Xihua Road.

In the area of Pingliang Road in Eastern Shanghai, from Huaxing Road to the end of Pingliang Road, the enemy has planted many landmines at various small intersections along the boundary of the Chinese-administered area.

The Japanese Girls' Elementary School on Shigaota Road in Hongkou has been used as the enemy's Hongkou District Headquarters since the 11th of this month. Recently, the enemy troops transported a large number of bamboo ladders and wooden planks made into wooden rafts, piling them up on Jungong Road and at the golf course near the riverbank for potential use in landings.

### Bombing of Zhabei Does Not Damage Fortifications

The Top Floor of the Railway Administration Building is Hit and Partially Burned

The Zhabei defense line on our army's right flank is fortified like a golden city. Although the enemy has repeatedly attacked, they have suffered heavy casualties. On the contrary, we have rushed to the intersection of North Sichuan Road, controlling the enemy's ability to move freely in the North Sichuan Road area. Knowing that the various lines in Zhabei are impregnable, the enemy has adopted a bombing policy. In recent days, enemy planes have been flying over the Zhabei area to bomb. Yesterday, several squadrons of enemy planes flew back and forth to the northwest of Baoshan Road, dropping heavy bombs. The North Station and the Railway Administration Building were their main targets. Streams of bombs were dropped on the building, and several hits were scored. The highest floor caught fire, and the stored luggage ticket stubs flew into the sky. The fire spread until the evening, when it was extinguished. Upon investigation, it was found that the building was constructed entirely of reinforced concrete, so although the fire burned all day, only a portion of the stored goods in the northeastern part of the top floor was destroyed. The other floors were not affected. Moreover, our army had long anticipated that the enemy would repeat the tactics of the January 28th Incident and bomb Zhabei. Therefore, the fortifications and related military equipment were arranged carefully and secretly. Even if Zhabei were bombed into a flat ground, it would not hinder our military defense. Therefore, although enemy planes have been bombing continuously for days, only civilian houses have been destroyed. Our military facilities have suffered no damage whatsoever. This morning, enemy planes were again active, but they were not dropping as many bombs as in the past few days. Therefore, apart from the bombing by Japanese planes, the front-line fighting has been very quiet, with only occasional guard gunshots.

### Kawagoe Meets with Hasegawa This Morning

At around 7:30 AM this morning, Kawagoe Shigeru, accompanied by Counselor Shimizu, traveled by car from his residence on Bi Xun Road to Hongkou to meet with enemy military commanders Hasegawa, Matsui, and Masaki, to hear reports on the front-line battles and discuss diplomatic issues. It was not until 8:50 AM that he returned to his residence in the French Concession via the Waibaidu Bridge in the same car.

### Yoshiko Kawashima Active in Shanghai

The enemy's Kwantung Army recently dispatched international spy Yoshiko Kawashima and several Chinese and Japanese women to Shanghai to engage in activities. It is now learned that they have established an intelligence agency somewhere to probe into Soviet intelligence. The person in charge there is Vonsiatsky, an important member of the White Russian fascists, who has several White Russians working under him and operating in Shanghai.

### Enemy Military Hospitals are Full

A General Indication of the Intensity of the Fighting

According to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the enemy army has established eleven military hospitals in the Hongkou area. Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road has not been used for military purposes and has now been closed. In the last two days, all eleven hospitals have been full, and doctors have been overwhelmed with patients. Therefore, many wounded soldiers have been transported back to Japan by ship in the past two days, which proves the general intensity of the recent fighting.

After fighting fiercely until dusk, they completely defeated the enemy, seizing two howitzers, 20 rifles. The enemy suffered more than 100 casualties, and the remnants fled westward. The brigade's main force attacked Tuanchengkou and Dongpaochi, west of Pingxing Pass, on the night of the 16th, completely recapturing the area. A large number of supplies were seized, and the inventory is being taken. The remnants fled towards Daying, and our army is pursuing towards Daying. (Special dispatch, 20th)

### US Delegation Departs for Europe Today

To Attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference; Portugal Decides to Send Representatives; Candidates for the French Delegation Determined

[New York] After President Roosevelt had a long talk with Davis, the chief American representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing, today, he declared that the US's participation in the Nine-Power Conference does not entail any responsibility on the part of the government to other governments. This is viewed as a response to Republican Senator Johnson, who said in a speech in San Francisco today that Davis would not depart for Beijing until Britain and the US had agreed on the procedures in advance. President Roosevelt also said that the purpose of the meeting is for all countries to agree on finding a way to resolve the current situation in China. Our efforts in this matter are aimed at cooperating with the other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, including China and Japan. The US delegation is scheduled to depart for Beijing on the "Washington" steamship on Wednesday. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)

⊙ Beijing: The Portuguese government has recently accepted Belgium's invitation and decided to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. So far, China, Britain, France, the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Portugal have accepted the invitation to participate in this conference. In addition, Italy is rumored to have decided to participate. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)

[Paris] The French cabinet held a meeting and decided to send Foreign Minister Daladier and Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Todescan as France's representatives to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. According to a press release issued after the meeting, Daladier had suggested inviting Sarraut to join the delegation, as Sarraut represented France in signing the Nine-Power Treaty. However, Sarraut stated that he is currently the Minister for North Africa and does not have time to participate in other political affairs. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

### Enemy Planes Continue to Wreak Havoc

Civilian Houses at the Haichang Road Intersection in Zhabei Catch Fire; Hongqiao Town is Ravaged Again This Morning

Zhabei

From 10:15 AM to 10:45 AM on the 20th, three enemy bombers were in the sky over Xinmin Road and Datong Road in Zhabei, dropping bombs in stages, for a total of twelve heavy bombs. The first three bombs dropped, one landed next to the former site of the Xinzha Police Station, destroying several civilian houses; one landed near the fire brigade on Xinmin Road, section one, destroying a corner of the fire brigade's lookout tower; a firefighter named Lu Wencai was injured in the head and feet and has been sent to Xianlong Hospital for treatment; and one landed in the old goods market on Nanxing Road. The second batch of six bombs landed consecutively south of Haichang Road, near the Fuxing First Flour Mill at the intersection of Changan Road along the Suzhou Creek. Many old burlap bag shops there immediately caught fire, and the Hengkang Rice Shop across the street was also burned down. The third batch of three bombs also landed to the left and right of the flour mill and at the eastern end of Changan Road. [Note:] At the time of this writing, the fire brigade is doing its best to put out the fire.

Also, according to reports, at around 9:00 AM, three enemy planes flew over Zhabei for a long time, dropping six bombs in the Dongbaoxing Road and Guangdong Street area. At 10:01 AM, several more enemy planes flew to the Zhabei Sun Temple, Republic New Road, Xinjiang Road, and Zhongshan Road areas, bombing indiscriminately, dropping five or six incendiary bombs near the Sun Temple, igniting three civilian houses instantly. The thick smoke filled the sky and is still burning. In addition, enemy planes dropped many absurd propaganda leaflets in various places in Zhabei this morning. Citizens picked them up, laughed at them, and tore them up.

Hongqiao

At 5:00 AM this morning, just as dawn was breaking, the small vegetable market in Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai was crowded with villagers selling vegetables, when it was suddenly bombed indiscriminately by three enemy planes. Five or six heavy bombs were dropped. Because they had been suffering from enemy air raids for days, the villagers had already taken precautions to hide, so there were only a little over a dozen casualties.

According to a person who came from Sijing this morning, a newspaper reported that enemy planes flew to the town yesterday and dropped bombs, but this did not happen.

Pudong

Four Japanese planes flew over the southern site of Zhangjiabang in Pudong at 8:00 AM this morning and strafed the area for an hour, unleashing machine-gun fire. They then crossed the Huangpu River to the Nanshi area, scouting along the river to Gaochangmiao and the Sun Hui Port area, dropping absurd leaflets. However, the people picked them up and tore them to pieces, not giving them a second glance.

At 11:00 AM today, three enemy heavy bombers took off from the northeast side of Pudong, circling around various places in the rear of Pudong. After one round of reconnaissance, they turned north along Pudong Avenue, dropping six or seven bombs in the Yangjiazha and Wujia Hall areas, aimlessly. Our army's fortifications were not damaged in any way.

Nanshi

From around 7:00 AM this morning, several enemy planes flew over Nanshi from time to time, continuously circling low over Gaochangmiao, Xietu Road, Longhua, Caohejing, and the Shanghai-Minhang Road for a long time. At around 10:00 AM, they gathered into a formation and flew west. When the planes were in the sky over the Shanghai-Minhang Road, they fired their machine guns indiscriminately downwards. A farmer who was plowing in the field did not have time to hide and was tragically wounded, but no bombs were dropped.

### In the Eastern Shanghai District, the Enemy Transports Our Property to Japan Again

In the Eastern Shanghai District, the properties of our residents were not able to be taken out after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. In addition to confiscating all food, timber, and fuel coal for military use, the enemy once transported more than 2,000 boxes of our Eastern Shanghai District's metal parts and small industrial machinery to Japan. Now, they are loading another thousand boxes of the remaining items onto the No. 82 transport ship, converted from an enemy merchant ship, which is docked at the Huangpu Wharf, preparing to transport them to Japan again, starting this morning (the 20th).

### Brief Commentary

Another Iron Proof of the Enemy Planes' Atrocities

Since the outbreak of the Songhu War, enemy planes have been wreaking havoc everywhere, treating it as their daily task. Not only are they not satisfied with slaughtering our civilians, but they even bombed and injured the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. After the British government lodged a serious protest, they apologized only after being unable to argue their way out of it. Unexpectedly, not long after, British Embassy Air Force Captain Murray and others were attacked again. This case is still under negotiation. But yesterday, the military attaché of the Italian Embassy, Libizzi, and a German citizen were bombed on the Suzhou Road. Although they were not injured, they were thoroughly frightened. Italy and Germany are our friendly nations and also the enemy's partner nations. Yet, their officials and businessmen cannot avoid being bombed. Such madness is bound to be condemned by the whole world. The enemy's diplomacy is becoming increasingly isolated, and they are on the road to self-destruction.

### From Tianjin to Shanghai

An Oppressed Man Recounts His Experience

(Special Dispatch) It has been nearly three months since the fall of Peiping (Beijing) and Tianjin. My friend, Mr. Yang, has been doing business in North China for over a decade. Since the enemy occupied Tianjin, his entire family has suffered inhumane treatment under the enemy's iron heel, repeatedly subjected to searches and arrests, barely escaping death. Only last Monday was he able to disguise himself as a coolie and take a British ship from Tianjin to Shanghai, enduring seven days of hardship. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he met with a reporter, claiming to have been reborn. What he discussed about the situation in the north, concerning matters that have already passed, will not be recorded. Now, I will extract and record a few details of his journey south:

Popular Aspirations in Peiping and Tianjin

Mr. Yang stated that after the enemy troops occupied Tianjin, their arrogance and barbaric behavior were truly infuriating. Thousands of young people and students were killed, a fact that the South should already know. Currently in Tianjin, except for the concessions, in the Chinese areas and the surrounding villages, there are virtually no women left. Elderly women in their sixties and seventies are often raped, and young girls are abducted to military camps for their animalistic desires, with those who resist being shot. In Chinese shops, the enemy takes whatever they want without paying. Items like eyeglasses, watches, and telescopes in watch stores are seen as spoils of war. The enemy often comes to take them, and the merchants have to force a smile to please them. Shanghai newspapers, in the beginning, were still delivered to the Tianjin post office, but after the enemy sent people to inspect them, they burned them daily, along with printed materials and letters. Tianjin is very isolated from news from the South, but the people of Peiping and Tianjin all eagerly hope for the early arrival of the Central Army and are particularly concerned about the Shanghai battles. The only hope for the people is to listen to the war reports from the Central Radio Station on the radio. Recently, the enemy sometimes impersonates the Central Radio Station, fabricating news of the Shanghai battles, distorting the truth and confusing right and wrong. Sometimes they use radio waves to interfere, making it impossible for radios to receive signals, leaving the people of Peiping and Tianjin unable to obtain news of the war in the South, causing them indescribable frustration. As for the "Yong Bao" (庸報 - Common Newspaper), which specializes in spreading rumors for the enemy, it uses the enemy's power to force Tianjin shops and residents to subscribe, even assigning a copy to every "tiger stove" (public bath house) for one yuan per month. If they don't read the paper, they are accused of being anti-Japanese. The other day, news of the Central Air Force bombing Tanggu reached Tianjin, and the enthusiastic joy of the people was beyond description. The people of Peiping and Tianjin greatly admire the soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army, and do not lightly forgive ☓☓☓☓☓. Recently, they have been eagerly anticipating the northward advance of the Central Army. Whenever a foreign ship arrives in Tianjin from Shanghai, they make every effort to inquire, and they are overjoyed when they hear of the great victories of our army in the Shanghai battles.

Seven Days of Painful Sea Voyage

In the past two months, at least 200,000 people have fled from Peiping and Tianjin, most of them landing in Yantai and then transferring to the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. Others have landed in Qingdao, and many have also come to Shanghai. However, buying tickets is very difficult. Mr. Yang did not manage to buy a third-class cabin ticket on a Swire Shipping ship until the 10th of this month, paying a premium of twenty yuan. He could only occupy a space on the open deck. The journey from Tianjin to Shanghai took a full seven days and seven nights, and the suffering of the passengers was indescribable. As the ship passed the mouth of Tanggu, as far as the eye could see, the enemy's bullets, artillery shells, and bombs were being unloaded from transport ships and piled up on the docks. The ship stopped in Yantai for a day and night, anchored offshore, and passengers could not land. It was not until the ship reached Qingdao that we were able to disembark. Currently, Qingdao has become a dead city. Residents, young and old, are under strict guard day and night, preparing for enemy air raids.

The Current Situation as Seen in Shanghai

The "Haikou" ship sailed outside Wusong Port at noon. When Mr. Yang was in the north, he could not know the true situation of the Shanghai battles. Therefore, as the ship passed Wugu Guasha (裹鍋沙), he looked out from the deck and could already see the enemy warships invading our Shanghai. From Wugu Guasha all the way to Wusong Port, there was a ship every so often, of varying sizes, totaling nearly forty ships. Some of the enemy ships could be seen to have just arrived from Japan, fully loaded with troops and military equipment. Their draft was sunk to the load line, proving how much they were carrying. Inside Wusong Port, up to the Garden Bridge, there were scattered enemy ships, about seventeen or eighteen. The "Izumo" in front of buoy number two was surrounded by large iron barges, and the ship was full of sandbags, even the smokestacks were covered with wire mesh. Entering the Wusong Port, the most shocking sight was the area from Wusong to Yunzaobang, where the magnificent buildings of factories and warehouses that once stood in rows were now all broken walls and ruins, with not a single one intact. As far as the eye could see, it was a scene of utter devastation. On the open space east of the Qiujiang Wharf, there were one or two thousand enemy horses, arriving but unable to be used, as well as hundreds of transport trucks. The flat-bottomed small military barges in the Huangpu River, which we had never seen before, were now everywhere. In the Yunzaobang area, there were even large quantities of rafts, and transport ships converted from merchant ships docked at various wharves were busily unloading military equipment and loading wounded soldiers.

Plundering Civilian Ships and Goods

Among the passengers who came to Shanghai on the same ship this time were twenty-five people who disembarked from Yantai. All of them were from Shaoxing and stated that they had been transporting passengers and goods along the Shanghai-to-Beiyang route with two large sand ships (each carrying 600 tons). The shipowner was surnamed Zhou. This time, while carrying two ships of goods, they sailed to the sea near Yantai at the beginning of this month and were intercepted by enemy warships. The ships and goods were all confiscated, and even the crew's luggage, clothing, and money were all looted. They even wanted to burn all twenty-five people on the two ships alive. After repeated pleas, they were tied up and locked in the ships, and were only released after being starved for four days. A gangplank was finally lowered and the twenty-five people were driven ashore at Longkou. Fortunately, they had acquaintances in Yantai who were fellow villagers, who managed to scrape together four hundred yuan to buy some clothes with about three hundred yuan and buy ship tickets, thus managing to return alive. However, the total loss of the ships and goods was over fifty thousand yuan. After Mr. Yang landed and observed the situation in Shanghai, he vehemently told the reporter, "The greatness of our national strength and the resilience of the unity between the military and the people are evident everywhere in the South. Victory in the war is assured. For three months in the North, I felt so oppressed that I could not breathe. Today, as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, the pent-up anger in my chest was finally relieved!" (Heart in Danger)

### International Problems Research Association Cables Nine-Power Treaty Signatories

Stating Opinions and Expectations Regarding the Sino-Japanese Dispute

Yesterday, the International Problems Research Association telegraphed the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty, stating our country's opinions on the Sino-Japanese dispute, as well as the expectations of our country's citizens before the Nine-Power Treaty conference. The telegram was signed by honorary directors Yen Hui-ching (顏惠慶), directors Li Zhaohuan (黎照寰), Liu Zhanen (劉湛恩), Dong Xianguang (董顯光), Chen Guangfu (陳光甫), Qian Xinzhi (錢新之), He Dekui (何德奎), Dai Zhiqian (戴志騫), and others. The original telegram stated in brief, "The Washington Nine-Power Treaty conference is about to be held in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. As it is the duty of our association, we hereby issue the following statement, in order to explain the important legal and political issues involved in Japan's invasion of our country. The current conflict is essentially a continuation of Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. After Japan annexed Manchuria and Jehol and established a puppet government there, it began various activities, using conspiracies and force, to separate North China from Chinese rule and make it independent. Japan has increased its garrison in Peiping and Tianjin without any legitimate reason, exceeding the number permitted by the 1901 Boxer Protocol by as much as four times. In the past, we could still recall that after the Chinese government moved its capital to Nanking and the relocation of the residences of foreign envoys in China, the importance of foreign troops protecting the railway line from Peiping to the coast had decreased. The Japanese militarists brazenly disregarded this, concentrated heavy troops in North China, and frequently held exercises in places not allowed by the terms of the Boxer Protocol, which led to the incident of July 8th, when they clashed with our garrison at Lugou Bridge. The Chinese government has done everything possible to seek a peaceful resolution, even withdrawing our troops, but Japan still expanded its military operations according to its predetermined plan to the five provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Shandong, an area of 700,000 square miles, and further forcibly occupied Peiping, Tianjin, and the Hai River, aiming to thoroughly implement its policy of conquering China by force. In order to connect with the war in North China, it also started a war in Shanghai, the center of our finances and economy, attempting to destroy our country's resistance in one fell swoop. Thus, it used the pretext of the Hongqiao incident (which was caused by Japanese armed sailors trying to break into our airport on August 9th) to concentrate a huge fleet in Shanghai within 48 hours, and landed a large number of troops, launching a large-scale attack on Zhabei outside the public concession. Japan's military operations in China's vast territory have lasted for more than three months and cannot be considered self-defense. It should be regarded as Japan's violation of its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the former requiring each signatory to respect the territorial and administrative integrity of China, and the latter condemning war as an instrument of national policy. As for the legal issues involved in the Shanghai incident, it is the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement of 1932. However, before the war in Shanghai, Japan built huge fortresses along the border of the public concession and stationed troops in Baziqiao. In fact, the agreement had already been violated by the Japanese side. The Chinese government, in view of Japan's invasion of North China and its dangerous schemes, was forced to order the necessary mobilization of troops in order to fulfill its primary responsibility of defending its territory. This action did not violate the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement. Moreover, the agreement never had a provision that permanently restricted the movement of Chinese troops within Chinese territory. Therefore, the responsibility for the war in Shanghai, which is similar to the undeclared war in North China by the Japanese army, must be borne by the Japanese side. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the war, the Japanese militarists have used all kinds of methods to trample on our ports, declared an illegal blockade of our entire coast, and used all kinds of mechanized weapons of modern warfare to wantonly bomb our cities. Almost all of our cities have been ravaged by Japanese aircraft, and a large number of innocent civilians, including refugees, women, and children, have been brutally murdered. Cultural institutions such as schools and hospitals have been destroyed. There is no need to elaborate on the shock and hatred that all of this has caused to people all over the world. Japan, in theory, is still at peace with China, but even if it were formally declared, Japan's actions have violated Article 25 of the Hague Peace Conference resolutions, which prohibits the bombing of undefended cities, etc., as well as the universally recognized principles of international law during wartime that distinguish between non-combatants and combatants. Furthermore, the bombing of Red Cross ambulance teams by Japanese airmen is even more shameful and violates the Geneva Convention of 1929. In view of the above circumstances, we have to conclude that Japan is now continuing its continental invasion plan that began in Manchuria in 1931. China, being the victim of Japan's invasion in the most brutal way, has no other way but to do its best to resist. We firmly believe that the dignity of treaties and the safety of nations must be collective in nature. Therefore, we can only appeal to the countries participating in the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty conference to not allow this Japanese aggression against China to set a dangerous precedent, and to resolutely take concerted action, including effective sanctions, to deal with the aggressor."

### Songjiang

Town Chief Arbitrarily Releases Seized Cattle

Near Wulitang, Tongbo Town, outside the north gate of this city, at about 10 PM on the 13th, more than sixty head of cattle were being led by cattle traders when they were spotted by patrolling militiamen, who questioned and temporarily detained them. The cattle traders initially resisted arrest and then attempted to bribe the militiamen with one hundred yuan. The militiamen fired warning shots. Subsequently, Xie Zhi (謝志), the town chief of the town, released them out of favoritism. The militiamen argued that they were under orders to seize the cattle, but the town chief released them without authorization, suggesting something improper. Therefore, they rushed to the Third District Security Command to report the matter overnight. According to the report, the district headquarters is secretly investigating.

Enemy Planes Frequently Pass Over Songjiang

From dawn to noon on the 14th, enemy planes came to Songjiang a total of eight times, flying very high. No bombs were dropped in the urban area, but explosions were heard in the northeast corner. It is reported that bombs were dropped in Qibao and Qingpu, etc., with four or five bombs dropped. The extent of the damage is under investigation.

### Taizhou

Enemy Attempt to Land Repulsed

At 12 PM on the 10th, several dozen enemy soldiers suddenly arrived at Chumen Town, Yuhuan County, on three small motorboats, and attempted to land in the Xuanmen Port. Our defending troops opened fire and bombarded them, and the enemy ships retreated to the open sea.

### Strictly Prevent Dock Workers from Being Exploited by the Enemy

No Excuses Allowed to Shirk Responsibility. Severe Punishment Will Be Imposed Upon Detection

The Shanghai Dock Workers' Improvement Society yesterday issued a notice to all workers, stating, "The country is currently facing a serious crisis. It is disheartening that dock workers in this city have always been disorganized, and some have been unknowingly exploited by the enemy. Therefore, Chairman Ye and Committee Member Xiasheng of the Society have requested the highest authorities to reorganize and restructure the society on their behalf. Notification No. 15 from the Chief Secretary has been forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters for verification. However, in the current all-out war of resistance, all citizens should unanimously support the government and strengthen the forces against the enemy. Even before the Society receives verification from the Municipal Party Headquarters, all steps should be taken in a unified manner. In addition to the concrete measures already planned for unemployed workers, all dock workers who have registered with the Society, regardless of the time, are absolutely prohibited from being exploited by the enemy and from loading, unloading, and transporting military equipment and goods for them, or any other work. No excuses of being forced or coerced will be allowed to shirk responsibility. If any of the above circumstances occur, the Society will impose the most severe punishment. If anyone is injured due to resisting the enemy, the Society will submit a special report to the authorities to request compensation. This notice is hereby issued."

### Qu Zhenhua Suggests Enacting a Law to Punish Embezzlement of Donations

Embezzling Donations Should Be Punished by Death. Accomplices Are Jointly Responsible

Mr. Qu Zhenhua, a leader in the Shanghai business community, yesterday suggested to the Second Special District Citizens' Federation that it forward a request to the government to quickly enact an emergency law to punish crimes during this extraordinary period. Any person in charge of raising, administering, or receiving funds for national salvation donations, relief donations, consolation donations, medical donations, and all other donations, as well as any fundraising organizations, who engages in self-enrichment, embezzlement of donations, or directly or indirectly profits from their actions, shall be sentenced to death upon discovery. All accomplices who collude in the fraud shall also be jointly responsible and punished with the same penalty, in order to deter others and uphold the law. At the same time, letters should be sent to military and police agencies, various organizations, and the offices of all fundraising efforts, urging them to strictly monitor each other. If any suspicious points arise, they must be reported as much as possible. In addition, all law enforcement agencies should act in good conscience and according to the law, without favoritism or perfunctoriness, and must thoroughly investigate and strictly handle the cases in order to concentrate financial resources and strengthen the forces of resistance. Whether or not this is appropriate, please put it to a vote.

### The Belief That Resistance Will Surely Lead to Victory

— Guo Woli (郭我力)

In recent years, Japanese warlords, for the sake of their promotion and wealth, have treated our beautiful land, lives, and property as fish and meat on their chopping block, wanting to cut and carve them up piece by piece to satisfy their insatiable desires. After swallowing the four northeastern provinces, they continued to attempt to take North China, and even Central and South China.

Violating all treaties of peace, disregarding the public laws that must be observed, flaunting their strong armor and sharp weapons, they fully exploit their robber-like character, wanting to destroy our entire China and then feel happy. Now, the all-out war of resistance has begun. The fighting in the past fifty days has exposed the weaknesses and ugly appearance of the enemy bandits. Facts tell us that only by resisting to the end and sacrificing to the end can we achieve the true liberation and ultimate glory of the nation!

Our oath to resist to the death has gained international sympathy and shifted international attitudes. Spiritual support will inevitably evolve into material assistance in the future, or at least lead to a thorough economic blockade of the enemy, which is their fatal wound. No matter how strong they are, they will inevitably collapse.

It is better to rely on oneself than to rely on others. While we urgently hope for international assistance, we must still strive and not rely on it. The final victory belongs to us, and this is not empty boasting. A comparison of national strengths shows sufficient reason to be sure of victory. The current war, if it lacks the important condition of economy, the future is indeed pessimistic. The enemy is a small island, inherently deficient, with industrial raw materials for civilian and military use all dependent on international supplies. Our country is vast and rich in resources, long regarded as the lifeline. In the past, due to people's obsession and politics not being on the right track, it has not been fully developed. Now, while supporting the long-term war of resistance, we are also launching a large-scale wartime development of natural resources, training the people, organizing the people, and arming the people. Working together with one heart, we are catching up rapidly. We can inflict serious blows on the enemy anytime, anywhere. Let alone a small island, what is there to fear from ten or eight of them?

We must also thoroughly understand ourselves. After uniting with sincerity and under the leadership of the most loyal and brave commander-in-chief, we have formed a solid wall of defense with orderly steps. No matter how overwhelming the force, it will not be enough to frustrate our anti-Japanese war of resistance. Moreover, the enemy suffers from internal imbalance and an unsound structure. The ancient saying goes, "Those who love to kill will surely be killed." The fate of some warmongers in history is inevitable collapse. The final stage of the Japanese warlords' invasion of China can be determined.

Youth are the vanguard of the people, especially the educated youth, who are the people's daredevils. Therefore, to complete this sacred cause of national liberation, we must first have this firm belief that resistance will surely lead to victory and lead the people in a fight to the death.
