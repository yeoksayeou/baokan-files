### Special Envoy Kong and His Entourage Arrive in London, Sino-British Dignitaries Hold Grand Meeting

Welcoming Cooperation among Friendly Nations in Construction, Travel to Europe for Inspection After Coronation

[London] China's special envoy Kong Xiangxi, dispatched to England to attend the coronation of the British King, and his entourage, including Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan, arrived at Dover Port this morning. Those who welcomed them at the pier included the King's representative, Admiral Sir Meade Fetherstonhaugh, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom and Deputy Envoy to the coronation, Guo Taiqi, the British Foreign Office representative George, the Air Ministry representative Colonel Willock, the Admiralty representative Lieutenant Commander Hilligan, the War Office representative Major Field, and many others. After disembarking, Special Envoy Kong and his entourage took a car to London, arriving at Victoria Station at 3:30 p.m. Overseas Chinese and key staff members of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom welcomed them at the station. After getting off the train, Special Envoy Kong, accompanied by Sir Meade Fetherstonhaugh, Deputy Envoy Chen, and Ambassador Guo, rode in the King's carriage to the Chinese delegation's residence at the Langham Hotel to rest. Subsequently, Special Envoy Kong met with reporters and gave a speech stating that he was extremely pleased to be ordered to represent the Chinese government and people in attending the grand coronation ceremony. He wished to take this first opportunity to convey the congratulations of the Chinese people to the British Empire. Sino-British relations have always been friendly and harmonious. In the past few years, China and Britain have had the opportunity to engage in active economic cooperation to seek stability in business and financial situations, which is not only beneficial to both countries but also to the world. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, China has reached a stage of financial balance and political unification, a phenomenon never seen before. Currently, all efforts are concentrated on economic and industrial construction and rural development. In this great work, China welcomes the cooperation of friendly nations. In order to provide my government with the latest materials to assist in advancing the process of economic construction, I intend to inspect and study the economic and industrial development of various European countries after the coronation ceremony is completed. In short, China has felt its responsibility in maintaining peace in the Far East and will surely strive to fulfill its due responsibility. He recalled that he had visited this country five years ago and was very happy. He would like to take this opportunity to renew old friendships and make new acquaintances. We are very pleased to be able to participate in this grand ceremony of the British Empire. Ambassador Guo will host a banquet for Special Envoy Zart and members of the special envoy delegation at the Claridge's Hotel tomorrow evening. British Foreign Secretary Eden, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and other important British government officials have been invited to attend. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)

### Tripartite Negotiations Between China, Britain, and Japan

Japanese Dispatch: China to Discuss Abolition of Extraterritoriality with Britain. Ambassador Kawagoe Advises Foreign Minister Sato; Japan Plans to Seize the Opportunity to Bolster Diplomacy and Restore the Political Situation.

[Tokyo] China intends to begin negotiations with various countries to abolish extraterritoriality. The Japanese government, having experienced this during the Meiji Restoration, naturally expresses sympathy for China. However, it believes that the completion of the judicial system is the primary condition for abolishing consular jurisdiction, and that its abolition should proceed gradually. Therefore, if there is a formal proposal from the Chinese government, the policy will be decided with reference to the attitudes of other countries. (Fourth, Allied Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Ambassador Kawagoe visited Foreign Minister Sato on the afternoon of the third, reporting on various incidents that occurred in China after his assumption of office, the content of Sino-Japanese negotiations to resolve these incidents, and the situation in China since the Xi'an Incident. He also made important recommendations regarding the future adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. He left after an hour. Ambassador Kawagoe plans to meet with the Foreign Minister again in two or three days to exchange views. It is reported that the Ambassador maintains a firm determination regarding the Japanese government's reconsideration of its China policy, so his future words and actions are noteworthy. (Fourth, Allied Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Observers generally believe that the government will seek to achieve some success in domestic and foreign policy before the special session of the Diet convenes in April. There is no doubt that Japan's foreign policy will continue to focus on China. The attitudes of the two major political parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, as well as other parties who previously expressed strong dissatisfaction with Arita's diplomacy, and Ambassador Kawagoe's proposal to establish a clear and unchanging policy toward China, are all important factors in considering future China policy. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's announcement of the gist of his proposal to Britain and the United States to adjust Sino-Japanese relations is particularly important. In this regard, it is not surprising that Tokyo is paying serious attention to the development of negotiations with London. It is rumored that the door opened to Japan by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, two years ago is still not closed. However, Japan's "political driving force" does not allow it to reach any understanding with Britain on any political issue related to China. At the same time, Japan's current liquidity situation makes it difficult to resume the plan of jointly providing financial and economic assistance to China. Therefore, what can be expected from the London negotiations is no more than ⑴ the easing of the generally bad atmosphere between Britain and Japan, and ⑵ the resolution of the smuggling problem in North China, with Britain mediating to reduce the tariffs China levies on Japanese goods. A Japanese newspaper recently published a prominent article stating that the price Japan paid to improve Sino-Japanese relations was Japan's permission for a concrete guarantee of neutrality in the Philippines, and suggested concluding a Pacific non-aggression treaty on the premise of restoring Sino-Japanese relations to normal. However, this news is unlikely to materialize. As for direct negotiations with China, the general impression is that there is a possibility of restarting them in the near future. Unless the expansion of Japanese industrial and commercial capital in China encounters obstacles, the North China issue, which China highly values, is unlikely to be resolved through Sato's diplomacy. The conservative meaning expressed by the general election results may make any new adventures in North China even more unwelcome to the majority of the people. Maintaining the status quo in North China seems to be the greatest extent to which the army will go. Japan will use this as a basis to try to prevent Britain and the United States from becoming more friendly to China, while continuing to maintain a "wait-and-see" attitude. (Fourth, Central News Agency Dispatch)

[London] Regarding the work of adjusting relations between Britain and Japan, the efforts of the British and Japanese authorities in the past few months have already manifested in facts such as the cancellation of perpetual lease rights and the resolution of the Keelung incident. It is heard that there is also comprehensive and close progress on fundamental issues such as trade issues and cooperation in the Far East. Although the negotiations have not yet left the preliminary work, contact between the Japanese Embassy in London and the British Foreign Office has indeed been quite frequent recently. British officials have also confirmed the above facts and revealed the following opinions today: The British and Japanese authorities are conducting negotiations in order to establish a close relationship between the two countries, which is a fact, but only preliminary negotiations. The basic issues of cooperation have not yet been discussed, but it is believed that the negotiations are promising and can achieve satisfactory results. (Third, Allied Dispatch)

[London] A responsible person on the British side recently stated that it is now credible that the Japanese government will soon submit various proposals to Britain in order to improve relations between Britain and Japan and resolve the interests of the respective countries in the Far East. Although Japanese sources here indicate that Japan has no reason to take such action in the near future, it is known to well-informed sources that a certain important Japanese figure recently informed Sir Clive, the British Ambassador to Japan, that the Japanese government is now preparing to submit various proposals to Britain in the near future. At the same time, special instructions will be issued to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Yoshida Shigeru, to follow. Currently, the Japanese Embassy in London and representatives of the Foreign Ministry have also begun preliminary talks. Japanese sources also acknowledge that the frequent comings and goings between the Japanese Embassy and the Foreign Ministry in recent months are sufficient to indicate that Britain and Japan have shown signs of approaching each other, but said that regarding the China issue, Japan believes that there is no need to make suggestions to Britain, but only for China and Japan to hold direct talks to resolve it. (Central News Agency, Third, Havas Dispatch)

[London] Regarding rumors that British-Japanese cooperation negotiations in China are about to begin, when asked about this matter to Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy who participated in the coronation ceremony of the King of England, Mr. Kong said that he firmly believes that Britain will be able to attach importance to China's interests in considering this matter. Mr. Kong further said that this conversation may be very beneficial. Mr. Kong continued, "There are millions of Chinese residents in the British Empire. They are both loyal people of Britain and filial sons and daughters of China. This is indeed a key that other two countries do not have." When asked if the rumors that his visit to England this time was in hopes of negotiating a loan were true, Kong said, "China's extensive economic development plan is now underway, so international financial cooperation is indeed necessary. As I am in charge of the country's finances, if borrowing abroad is more favorable than raising funds domestically, I will naturally pay attention to its possibility at any time. Beyond that, I cannot say more at this time." Mr. Kong said that when he passed through the capital of the Czech Republic, he had a famous local doctor conduct a full-body examination and found that he had recently suffered from a mild case of valvular enlargement of the heart. Therefore, he plans to go to Bad Homburg, twenty-four miles northeast of Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, for half a year of treatment after his affairs in London are completed. Mr. Kong also said that his daughter recently suffered from an eye disease and has undergone approximately one operation in Prague, after which she should be fine. It is also heard that Mr. Zha will go to Geneva after participating in the coronation ceremony of the King of England to attend the League of Nations meeting on May 26 and intends to convene a meeting of Chinese envoys from various European countries in that place. Furthermore, Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, hosted a banquet today to welcome the Chinese delegation. Among those invited were British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, British government economic advisor Frederick Leith-Ross, former British Ambassador to China Cadogan, and many dignitaries from all walks of life.

### National Defense Line (3)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di

Several large trucks were parked in the darkness in the courtyard. These were brought over by the puppet troops after their defection. Now, they are preparing to transport the belongings of the defected troops to southern Shanxi. Throughout the night, they kept honking their horns and flashing their lights. People were clamoring, footsteps were shuffling, and miscellaneous objects were constantly clanging. …

I was kept awake all night by the noise. However, I immediately realized: By chance, I happened to encounter Jin Xianzhang's troops heading from Suiyuan to southern Shanxi.

"Is your Division Commander Jin here?" I asked.

"The Division Commander went to Taiyuan today."

I was a little melancholy: I missed an opportunity for a good talk. Listening carefully to the clamorous sounds, I immediately discerned various dialects: Shandong accents, Henan accents, Hebei accents, and occasionally even Northeastern accents. Thinking about the past experiences and encounters of these people: from "bandits" to "National Army," to "scattered bandits," to "puppet troops," to "puppet troops invading Suiyuan," and then to "defected troops." It is indescribable, but today they are standing with us, 450 million compatriots, jointly shouldering the heavy responsibility of saving the country and the nation from peril. In admiration, I felt an indescribable sense of kinship and excitement.

Since their defection last year, which enabled the smooth recovery of Damiao and frightened the enemy, they have been mobilized several times and undergone some training in these past few months. Now, their military discipline is very strict, and all parties are unanimously praising and encouraging them. This time, when Yan Xishan was in Suiyuan, the result of his discussion with senior generals such as Fu Zuoyi was to decide to transfer this part of the defected troops to the southern Shanxi area for further strict training, in order to become an elite force to defend the country and protect the people. Great expectations are placed on them. Tomorrow morning, they will set off for Yangmingbao inside Yanmen Pass, where they will board the trains on the Datong-Puzhou Railway and head straight to southern Shanxi (later, I learned in Taiyuan that their final garrison was in the Jiexiu area). I hope they will keep in mind the expectations of the people of the whole country, the painstaking efforts of the authorities, and their original intention of defection, and move forward on the path of light!

Datong is the first important town in northern Shanxi, a large station on the Ping-Sui Railway, and also a very important key town in our country's long national defense line against Japan in North China. In August last year, the bandit army under Wang Dao once harassed Yanggao, intending to advance on Datong. The main purpose was to occupy this place and cut off the connection between our Suiyuan front line and the rear. If they succeeded, another effect would be to threaten Shanxi and break the Jin-Sui united front. Furthermore, there was an additional effect: if the enemy saw a favorable opportunity, they would return westward from here to attack Suiyuan's rear, heading straight for the Ikezhao League in Suiyuan and reaching the Alxa E'lu'te Banner and Ejina Torghut Banner in Ningxia, thus realizing the enemy's long-held "Great Yuan Empire" conspiracy. At that time, the enemy's special agencies on this route had already existed. By using the method of bandit and puppet troops harassing the area, they would clear the obstacles along the way. Then, the enemy's power would follow, presenting a "when the water comes, the channel is formed" scenario. However, Wang Dao's bandit troops encountered a hard nail on their first attempt and were blocked. Then, the Battle of Suiyuan broke out, and the enemy concentrated its forces and went to Suiyuan East to harass. In the following hundred days, the enemy's westward route changed repeatedly, sometimes focusing on Suiyuan North, sometimes focusing on Suiyuan East, but from beginning to end, the Yanggao and Datong route was always in a tense crisis. Not to mention, if Suiyuan East had unfortunately fallen at that time, then the danger of this route would have become as urgent as the Suiyuan North and Suiyuan East routes. The entire history of the Battle of Suiyuan might have become something else entirely.

From the perspective of connecting the Suiyuan front line and the rear, from the perspective of linking the Jin-Sui provinces' united front, or from the perspective of Datong's own geographical location, Datong is always a key, an important town, and a fortress on our country's national defense line against Japan in North China.

Recently, the authorities have long noticed the importance of this place. Therefore, in the defense line built by Jin and Sui along the Taihang Mountains, passing through Tianzhen, Datong, to Xinghe and Taolin in Suiyuan, Datong is also the most critical location. My original plan this time was not to stay in Datong for more than a few days, but due to various reasons, I had to leave in a hurry. When I met Mr. Li Fuying in Suiyuan, I agreed with him that when I inspected here, I would ask him to provide various conveniences. He readily agreed and expressed his hope that I could see more of Datong; however, this agreement could not be fulfilled at this time.

Later, in Taiyuan, a friend talked to me about Yungang. I told him that I hadn't gone to visit, and he jumped up in surprise and said:

"What! You passed through Datong without visiting Yungang? Then aren't you..."

I understood that he meant that I had wasted my trip to Datong; I shook my head and stopped him, saying: "As long as the territory is preserved, the historical sites can be visited at any time. This time, let's first look at other more important things; as for visiting historical sites, I hope that in the next few years, we can have a more reassuring opportunity than now, and then we can have a purely tourist trip."

We looked at each other with bitterness; even more excited.

Current Commentary

### On the Rumor of Anglo-Japanese Cooperation in China

The backbone of Japan's China policy is the vigorous implementation of the continental policy. This is something everyone knows. Based on this policy, Japan opposes the intrusion of European and American forces into the Far East and does not want China to get close to countries like Britain and the United States. However, recently, news of Anglo-Japanese cooperation in China has been widely spread in Tokyo and London. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun first published on the 21st of last month news that Britain had suggested cooperation with Japan in China. London newspapers also published news that Japan had suggested cooperation with Britain in China, saying that diplomatic representatives of the two countries were now in close contact and that concrete results would soon be seen. The development of this matter has a very significant relationship with our country.

Regarding the issue of Anglo-Japanese cooperation, although Japanese newspapers say that the British side first proposed it to Japan, we believe that the initiator of this matter is still in Tokyo. Why would Japan now change its past policy of swallowing China alone and ask Britain to cooperate together? There are very important reasons for this. First, China's unified strength has greatly increased since the peaceful resolution of the Liangguang Incident and the Xi'an Incident last year. Japan can no longer treat us with its previous aggressive policies. Secondly, due to the strengthening of China's unified situation, international relations have also greatly improved. Especially after the Xi'an Incident last year, the relations between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries and China have undergone major improvements. The formation of this close relationship is the result of Japan's aggressive policy. If Japan does not change its China policy now, then the relations between these peaceful countries will further strengthen. Thirdly, the results of the Japanese parliamentary elections have greatly reduced the government's prestige. The military's aggressive China policy has been unanimously opposed by the Japanese people. Therefore, the Japanese government had no choice but to change its past policy and propose cooperation with Britain in China.

Since Japan's request for British cooperation in China stems from such unavoidable reasons, its ambition for our country will naturally not be completely abandoned. Although the content and conditions of cooperation between the two countries have not yet been concretized, according to various newspapers, they generally include the following points. ㊀ Japan recognizes Britain's existing economic development in central and southern China. ㊁ Britain recognizes Japan's special economic and military strategic interests in North China, but recognition of Manchukuo is not a major condition. ㊂ Britain, the United States, Japan, and France jointly lend money to China. ㊃ China and Japan establish a treaty of friendship. If this kind of cooperation method is fully realized, China will be divided into British and Japanese protectorates.

This kind of proposal by Japan can essentially gain the approval of British political circles because Britain's China policy has always emphasized the expansion of economic power. Previously, British economic envoy Sir Frederick Leith-Ross visited Tokyo twice to try to agree with the Japanese government on a method of cooperation so that Britain's economic interests would not be excessively damaged. However, Leith-Ross's attempt ultimately failed due to the strong attitude of the Japanese military. Now, if Japan can change its policy of swallowing China alone and recognize Britain's special interests in central and southern China, then that is of course what the London government is seeking. However, we cannot make such an optimistic observation of the future of Anglo-Japanese cooperation. Japan's suggestion of cooperation with Britain is only to ease the international atmosphere and alienate Sino-British relations. It has not truly abandoned its continental policy of swallowing China alone. Therefore, if we want Japan to change its China policy and prevent our country from becoming the target of imperialist aggression, then we can only unite as a nation and fight to the death with the aggressors. Apart from this, there seems to be no other way to go.

### The Hayashi Cabinet Practices "Waiting for the Weary Enemy" on Political Parties

Dissolution and Resignation Determined by the Situation; Planning to Use Three Cabinet Seats as Bait for Party Members

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Sato stated today that the current situation does not allow the government to proceed with everything according to normal procedures. According to normal procedures, since the opposition party occupies the majority, either the parliament will be dissolved again, or the cabinet will resign, one of them must happen. Each political party does not want to hastily submit an impeachment case against the government to the parliament. Unless they know for sure that the next cabinet's attitude towards political parties opposed to the government is the same as the current cabinet's, they do not want to take this step lightly. The Foreign Minister also mentioned diplomatic issues, saying that Japan's proposal to reduce naval armaments is still too early. He believes that the government should adopt a wait-and-see policy on this matter. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi met with reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence on the evening of the 3rd. Regarding the government's fundamental attitude towards the political situation after the general election and the special parliament, he made the following remarks:

㊀ Measures to deal with the political situation after the general election: After the general election, the government will first study the current cabinet's policies to face the special parliament. Since the current cabinet has no so-called party affiliation, it will never immediately decide to advance or retreat based on the fact that the majority of parliamentarians oppose the government. Before the government listens to the discussions of the parliamentarians in the special parliament, it will not consider the issue of advancing or retreating based on the political parties' opposition to the government or other reasons. When exchanging opinions with the cabinet members in recent days, there was a discussion on the issue of general resignation, but the result was a decision as announced in the Prime Minister's speech on the 3rd. I personally have not considered issues such as general resignation first.

㊁ Attitude towards the special parliament: After the special parliament opens, it is unknown whether the political parties will propose a vote of no confidence. However, the issue of dissolving the parliament again or implementing a general resignation can only be decided after the special parliament opens and judges the situation. The government will judge the parliamentarians' speeches, the political parties' attitudes, and various other situations in the parliament, and if it knows that the newly elected parliamentarians' understanding of the current situation is different from the government's understanding, it can consider dissolving the parliament again.

㊂ Issue of filling vacant cabinet posts: The government plans to appoint cabinet members as soon as possible, that is, to evaluate suitable candidates from all aspects. The Minister of Education, the Minister of Railways, and the Minister of Colonial Affairs will be decided before the 15th. Under the current circumstances, there is no consideration of negotiating with political parties to join the cabinet. My feelings towards the political parties are the same as when the cabinet was formed. I hope that the so-called new party will be established, but I myself am unwilling to actively carry out the work of forming a party. The situation after the general election is such that it is extremely difficult to establish a new party. (Allied News Agency, 4th)

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai held its last election committee meeting this morning at Sanentei, with Hatoyama, Maeda, Shimada, Nakajima, and other committee members acting as representatives, and Secretary-General Ando and other members attending. After discussing the party's movements after the general election, the following unanimous opinion was reached: The government has already issued a statement on the 3rd declaring its attachment to power, which has exposed its essence as the embodiment of egoism. Its advance and retreat depend solely on the subjective views of the bureaucrats, and it has reached the extreme of trampling on the general will of the people and violating the constitution. Our party can only continue to "overthrow" it, as we have repeatedly stated, and not allow such a cabinet to continue to exist for even a day. Therefore, in order to decide the party's formal attitude towards the new situation, a general meeting of parliamentarians should be convened. However, in preparation, it was decided to first hold a temporary general affairs meeting and a temporary executive meeting on the 5th. The general meeting of parliamentarians will be held around the 11th. (Allied News Agency, 4th)

[Tokyo] According to the Kokumin Shimbun, Prime Minister Hayashi's statement is extremely disagreeable to all political parties and various circles of the House of Peers. They are now urging the cabinet to resign immediately. The Privy Council, which has been observing the political situation from the sidelines, now also harbors anti-government sentiments. At the same time, the Prime Minister's attachment to power can be believed from his answers to reporters' questions. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)

### Britain and the United States Negotiate Reciprocal Trade Agreement

Britain Now Willing to Actively Proceed

[London] Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that there are currently no plans to change the currency agreement concluded between Britain, France, and the United States several months ago. He said that he had not heard of the US Treasury's purchase of 500 million yuan of gold. Britain is currently working closely with the United States and other national governments to maintain the balance of the currency system as much as possible. During the implementation of this policy, it is also necessary to purchase gold when necessary. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)

[London] It was learned here today that US envoy Davis had lunch with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain last Monday to exchange views for a long time. It is said that Chamberlain very much wanted to dispel the US side's impression that Britain was deliberately hindering the conclusion of a British-US reciprocal trade agreement and hoped that negotiations on this agreement could proceed soon, but both denied discussing the war debt issue. (Kokumin Daily, 3rd)

[London] US envoy Davis met with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain last week. Well-informed sources recently announced that the two discussed general issues and unanimously agreed that Belgian Prime Minister Janson, entrusted by the British and French governments, is currently investigating the possibility of removing international trade barriers. Before this investigation is completed, all attempts to reduce tariff barriers are futile and useless. In addition, Davis and Chamberlain have agreed that various issues between Britain and the United States, especially commercial issues, will be discussed after the end of the British Imperial Conference. (Central News Agency, Havas, 3rd)

[London] Vilett, the former Director of the Information Department of the Foreign Office and former US correspondent of The Times, recently published an article in the newspaper discussing the mutual reduction of tariffs between Britain and the United States, stating that Britain and the United States are currently conducting negotiations on the establishment of a commercial agreement. The Democratic Party currently in power in the United States has always advocated reducing import duties and promoting free trade policies. It has already promised to reduce tariffs on certain British manufactured and semi-manufactured products. This is all that can be told to readers at present. As for the extent to which the US government can promote the freedom of international trade, the main key lies in the extent to which the economic nationalism of various countries can be rejected. (China-UK Agency, Havas, 4th)

Amsterdam: Belgian financial expert Fraer, under the order of Belgian Prime Minister Janson, went to various countries to investigate possible ways to break down international trade barriers, and has arrived in the Netherlands. He held a two-hour long talk with Dutch Prime Minister Dr. Colijn today. (Kokumin Daily, Haitong Telegram, 4th)

### The Duke of Windsor and Mrs. Simpson Reunite in a French Villa After a Long Separation

Met in the Villa's Study for a Few Minutes; Secret Travel, Wedding Date Undecided

Mengzhi, France: The Duke of Windsor met with Mrs. Simpson today at the Gondé villa outside of here. The Duke of Windsor took a special train from Salzburg, Austria, to a small station in Vanneuy, 31 miles outside of Paris, and then changed to a pre-arranged car to travel south. The car traveled at about 60 miles per hour, with four police motorcycles leading the way, followed closely by three cars carrying detectives and others. Twelve British and French detectives were stationed in shifts at the iron gate of the villa, prohibiting idlers from entering. According to intelligence, the Duke and Mrs. Simpson met in the villa's study and only spent a few minutes before meeting and chatting with the residents. Then they had lunch together and sat on the balcony to rest. (Kokumin Daily, 4th)

[Paris] The Duke of Windsor will probably hold a wedding ceremony with Mrs. Simpson at the Gondé villa. When the Duke got off the train, Mrs. Simpson's car was waiting outside the station, but Mrs. Simpson stayed at the Gondé villa. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)

Tours, France: The former British King, Duke of Windsor, arrived at the Gondé villa here at 1:35 pm today in a Canadian-made large car, followed closely by a car carrying detectives and cinematographers. Along the way, there were six policemen escorting on motorcycles. When the Duke got off the train at the small station in Vanneuy, his movements were extremely secret, and very few people knew about it. Only ten photographers, who had followed him from Austria in the same car, saw the Duke get off the train and immediately jumped out to surround him. Onlookers watched silently, and wireless broadcasters reported the Duke's actions on the radio for broadcast. Mrs. Simpson's friend Rogers recently announced that the Duke of Windsor is now a guest at the Bitaud couple's villa in Gondé and plans to stay for a few days. The wedding date has not yet been decided. (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)

Salzburg: The former British King, Duke of Windsor, left here this afternoon on a fast train with a beloved dog. He will arrive in Paris tomorrow morning. The Austrian police department followed the car to the Austrian border at that time, and the Austrian chauffeur also followed. The Duke of Windsor drove his own car to Salzburg, and another car carried his luggage, including eight huge boxes, two golf bags, and several small suitcases. The Duke of Windsor wore a light gray coat and a black hard felt hat, and was in very good spirits. He arrived here four minutes before the train arrived. His travel schedule was kept strictly secret, so his departure was very quiet. Only the stationmaster, an Austrian official, saw him off. The Duke of Windsor waved to him with a smile. (China-UK Agency, Reuters, 3rd)

[Paris] People in Mengzhi, France, were very excited and enthusiastic after learning that the Duke of Windsor would visit Mrs. Simpson at the Gondé villa near Tours. Reporters and photographers arrived from all directions one after another. The remaining houses in the village and the surrounding county were fully booked, and countless special telephone and telegraph lines were set up between there and Tours to ensure that the news could be sent all over the world as soon as the Duke of Windsor arrived.

### The Vatican Responds to German Protest

Vatican: Pope Pius XI issued an encyclical on March 21 criticizing Germany for violating the 1933 Concordat. The German government protested to the Vatican. The Vatican sent a reply to the German Ambassador, Fershan, today. Although Church officials are keeping silent about the contents of the reply, well-informed sources say that this reply will definitely point to the recent remarks made by German leader Hitler, which were used to oppose Catholicism. The fact that the Vatican's reply was sent when German Foreign Minister Neurath was visiting Rome is also quite meaningful. (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)

### Two American Billionaires Accused of Evading Income Tax

[New York] Business tycoons Shebon and Rysco (President and Vice President of American Constant Color Company) were accused of underpaying income tax in 1929. According to the authorities, the two had bought and sold all their securities and stocks to each other, claiming to have suffered losses in 1929 to evade income tax. DuPont paid US$617,316, and Rysco owed US$1,026,340. Today, the two went to the Tax Appeals Board to explain that this sale was legal. As for buying and selling to each other instead of doing it in the open market, it was because the securities market was very sluggish in 1929, and they did not want to make the market even worse.

### Italian Press Denies Military Alliance Between Germany and Italy

Neurath and Mussolini Hold a Long Conversation; Göring Again Active in Yugoslavia; Hungary Still Supports the German-Italian Axis

[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath visited Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon and held talks for approximately two hours. Count Ciano, the Foreign Minister, was also present. (Havas Agency dispatch from Rome, 3rd)

[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath visited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon and held a one-and-a-half-hour long conversation. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. It is reported that the talks were extremely amicable. The newspapers here warmly welcomed the German Foreign Minister's visit, believing it further confirms the friendly relations between the two countries. The Italian News listed the importance of German-Italian cooperation and its impact on the European political situation, emphasizing that the German-Italian axis neither divides the world in two nor hinders European peace efforts, but rather serves as a tool for communication between the two sides. As for foreign reports that the purpose of the German Foreign Minister's visit was to conclude a military agreement, the newspaper strongly denied this, saying that such rumors had already been circulating when Göring and von Blomberg visited Italy some time ago, and that they were completely groundless. (National Maritime Telegram, 3rd)

[Rome] Immediately upon arriving here this morning, German Foreign Minister Neurath held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia, lasting for 75 minutes. According to reliable sources, the two discussed the general European situation. However, the Spanish issue and the German-Italian axis were also discussed. Furthermore, it is claimed by authoritative sources that there is nothing alarming in the German-Italian talks. The Austrian issue was also discussed again. It is said that both sides acknowledged that it would be very difficult to successfully resolve the Danube River issue without unified cooperation between the two countries. Regarding the Western European agreement, Germany and Italy will proceed along a common path, but they do not intend to seek a quick resolution until the Spanish issue is resolved. (Reuters dispatch from Rome, 3rd)

[Rome] Responsible figures here recently stated that both sides made clarifications on the following three issues: ❶ Italy and Germany reaffirmed their willingness to respect the territorial integrity of Spain, but only on the condition that the Soviet Union does not use any pretext to extend its influence in the Mediterranean. ❷ The political axis formed by Italy and Germany is the pivot for the peaceful improvement of the European situation, and all countries are welcome to participate. ❸ Italy and Germany have no plans to form a military alliance or agreement. King Victor Emmanuel III received Foreign Minister Neurath at the Quirinal Palace at 8:00 AM this morning for a half-hour meeting. Subsequently, they went together to the Massimo Palace to preside over the opening ceremony of the German Science Museum. Neurath then returned to the German Embassy for lunch and is scheduled to hold a second conversation with Prime Minister Mussolini in the afternoon. In the evening, Foreign Minister Ciano will host a banquet for him at a villa in the suburbs. (Havas Agency dispatch via Sino-British News Agency, 4th)

[Rome] The semi-official Italian newspaper, "Il Giornale d'Italia," recently published an article by the well-known journalist Gayda, discussing the visit of German Foreign Minister Neurath, stating, "If the Spanish issue continues to exist, then seeking a solution to the appeasement of Western Europe will be untimely." It also stated that neither Germany nor Italy seeks territorial or political interests in Spain; their sole purpose is to preserve Spain "so that the communist revolutionary movement instigated by foreign countries cannot gain a foothold there." (Havas Agency dispatch from Rome, 3rd)

Capital of Hungary. After Austrian President Miklas arrived here, Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy hosted a banquet at the Royal Palace last night, and in his speech stated, "The Rome Protocols are indeed the linchpin of our two countries' foreign policy, have already produced good results, and have become the most important factor in the construction projects of the Danube River basin. The establishment of good relations between Hungary and the powerful German Empire is an especially auspicious sign for the future. It is hoped that the friendship between Austria and Hungary will become the cornerstone of peaceful development for both sides." President Miklas responded by saying, "Austria and Hungary share the same interests and are therefore united and have restored their original strength, sufficient to solve the major problems currently facing us. As we pursue a policy of peace and strive to safeguard freedom and national self-determination, Italy will surely provide practical support, and Germany will also maintain friendly relations with us. It is my belief that this is an important guarantee for the peaceful development of Austria, Hungary, and the countries of the Danube River basin." (Havas Agency dispatch from Rome, 4th)

[Berlin] After returning to Germany from Italy, General Göring visited Yugoslavia en route. Prince Paul, the Regent of that country, hosted a banquet for him at Bled. Political circles speculate that various issues between Yugoslavia and Hungary have been discussed, and that the issue of ethnic minorities was also a subject of negotiation. It is indicated here that General Göring and Prince Paul have had very close personal relations for many years, so this visit should not be considered to have special political significance.

### Hollywood Labor Strike Worsens

Makeup Studio Destroyed, Filming Continues as Usual

Hollywood. Striking film industry workers rioted today. A number of union workers, armed with hammers, vandalized the Westmore Beauty and Makeup Studio, jointly operated by two major Hollywood studios, causing approximately US$10,000 in damages. According to union leaders, the studio had been supplying non-union replacement workers to various film studios. The Westmore Beauty and Makeup Studio is managed by the Westmore brothers, who also serve as the heads of the makeup departments for Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, and Paramount, three major film companies. Lessing, the acting chairman of the Film Workers Union, announced that he had sent a letter to Green, the chairman of the American Federation of Labor, protesting the strike-breaking attitude of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, an affiliated organization. He has also requested support from the Los Angeles labor unions to be a precursor to a total strike of all studios. The employers have dispatched four representatives to negotiate terms with the Screen Actors Guild, including the recognition of the union. (National Telegram, 3rd)

Hollywood. Six thousand film technicians and others in Hollywood are still on strike. A thousand pickets are stationed in front of the nine major film production companies, patrolling back and forth. However, filming work is still proceeding as usual. According to Smith, the chairman of the strike committee, the companies are sending many makeup artists and other workers into the studios at night when there are fewer pickets. Production at Pathé was delayed because someone had stuffed matchsticks into the door locks of the office building. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th)

Hollywood. Pickets are still stationed in front of the studios of the ten major film companies today. However, the stars of the studios are able to pass through safely. It is reported that the strikers have been photographing actors passing through the picket lines so that they can be publicized and labeled as "anti-union elements." (National Telegram, 3rd)

### Crowded Streets in London

Bus Workers Toil Hard; Working Hours Should be Reduced

[London] The London bus strike inquiry tribunal began its investigation today. Bevan, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union and the leader of the strike, stated to the tribunal today that London's traffic problems are constantly changing and progressing. Consequently, the mental strain on bus drivers is increasing daily. Furthermore, the lives of these drivers are unregulated, with irregular eating and sleeping habits, which greatly affect the workers' health. The Institute of Industrial Hygiene has been investigating this matter for several years. The union feels that since work on the streets of London is tense and the workers' health is affected by it, it cannot stand idly by. Therefore, reducing working hours is a method of reducing this adverse impact. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 3rd)

[London] Today is the third day of the London bus strike. The citizens of London have not changed their calm demeanor as a result. In the early morning, citizens going to work have switched to trams or underground railways, while others are walking to their destinations. In addition, the weather is clear today, so there are even more pedestrians. The sidewalks are extremely crowded, and taxis are flowing continuously in the middle of the road. Those who usually park on the streets to solicit business are now carrying passengers and are overwhelmed with customers. Even old, unused cars that have been idle for some time are filling the streets. There are also many people renting bicycles. The famous London bicycle merchant, Willis Company, is experiencing a tenfold increase in business, the greatest prosperity since the general strike of 1926. Representatives of the Central Committee recently announced that the strikers do not intend to have tram drivers and ticket sellers join the strike while the city's Transportation Bureau investigation committee is conducting its investigation. However, if private car companies operate temporary services to replace buses, this will be considered a provocative act that could cause disruption. The city's Transportation Bureau has now ordered tram companies and underground railway companies not to take the opportunity to increase the number of passenger vehicles in order to avoid undermining the bus strike.

(Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 3rd)

[Paris] After the Spanish Nationalist authorities refused to provide protection for ships transporting refugees from the port of Bilbao, French officials declined to comment, only stating that Britain and France have the right to protect their ships on the high seas.

### Gleanings from Yunnan Travel (6)

— Bei Quan

The Thirteenth Day (April 17th), Rain. Traveled thirty kilometers from Changde to Taohuayuan. The path wound tortuously along the entrance of the peach blossom forest, climbing up the steps. About two li to the cave entrance, there was an old stele of "Qin People's Ancient Cave," and "Below is Wenjin Pavilion." There were inscriptions from the Jin, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Beside it, there was an ancient well that never dried up despite drought. To the right was Guanyin Hall with five rooms, enshrining Tao Yuanming. Peonies in the courtyard were blooming vigorously, said to be three hundred years old. The inner eight scenic spots and outer eight scenic spots were all seen in the notes, so they are not recorded here. There were many couplets in the hall, but they were too verbose and uninteresting. Only Yang Ruihan's couplet, "The rise and fall of Qin and Han are consigned to the flowing stream, the news of immortals is asked from peach blossoms," was quite transcendent. According to records, Peach Blossom Spring has been mentioned since Tao Yuanming's account, Wang Wei's "Peach Blossom Spring Journey," Li Bai's preface, and Han Yu's "Song of Peach Blossom Spring." Many literati throughout history have composed poems about it. Today, ascending to this place, although the cave source is less than three xun (a Chinese unit of length), and the environment is not as described in the past, it is still rich in historical significance and worth lingering for a while. County Magistrate Liu of Taoyuan County died of intestinal fever and typhoid fever last night. Many people in the market town are suffering from typhoid fever because there is only one Catholic hospital on East Street, with only one doctor. The total population of Taoyuan County is over 540,000. There are two newspapers, "People's Voice News" and "Popular News."

Arrived at Cha'anpu at noon. Some villagers were selling Beijing-style goods, stationery, jade bracelets, Boshan refined crystal, and Nanyang stone seals, emptying their old stock. They were selling under the reputation of Taoyuan stones, but only the pebbles were actually produced locally. Then entered the mountain, winding and turning to 950 meters (above sea level), at the foot of the "Xuefeng Mountain" range. People in the car felt tired. This journey passed through such a winding road in Huangshan, and now reaching Xuefeng is the second time. Arrived in Yuanling in the evening. First watched Miao girls drumming at "Fubo Pavilion," then crossed the river to watch Miao people dancing the lion dance, lively and exquisite, unmatched by lion dance performers from other places. Secretary Shi Honggui of the Special Commissioner's Office, a graduate of Wenhua University, is an outstanding member of the Miao ethnic group and has contributed greatly to the communication of culture and feelings between the local Han and Miao people. Another Mr. Shi led a Miao martial arts troupe to perform Miao sword, Miao spear, meteor hammer, steel fork, and other techniques. However, these are all ancient Chinese martial arts that have been passed down among the Miao people and are now generally regarded as Miao customs.

The total population of Yuanling County is over 240,000. The market is quite prosperous. Many Guizhou merchants do business here because goods can be transported directly to Zhenyuan via the Yuanshui and Fushui rivers. Each day, special goods are transported in bulk from Yunnan and Guizhou to Hunan by several or more than ten trucks. Therefore, there are also around four hundred entertainment houses, and they have caretakers and education, the team is orderly, and the uniforms are all light blue bamboo cloth shirts led by an electrical official. There are many roadside inns with newly built three-story buildings, which shows that western Hunan, after the banditry, has a prosperous market, and "opium" and "prostitution" also contribute considerably.

From the standpoint of national unity, it seems unnecessary to establish a separate society for the Miao people or to make excessive publicity about them. It should be understood that we are different from foreigners who come to China for archaeology. This time, the Hunan government specially gathered Miao people to showcase various skills, which, although intended to promote them, seemed to have some unnatural feelings involved. According to investigations, there are about 400,000 Miao people in the five counties of western Hunan, while there are more than 2 million Miao people in Guizhou, accounting for more than one-third of the province's population. Adding the Miao people in Guangxi, Sichuan, southern Jiangxi, and Yunnan, the total number should be over 10 million. Now that they are all listed as common people and moving forward under the same Qing Bai flag, the boundaries should become more blurred. It seems unnecessary to be driven by curiosity to take photos of Miao girls and appreciate Miao people dancing.

The Fourteenth Day (April 18th), departed from Yuanling and went to Chenxi along the Yuan River. Crossed the Yuan River and arrived at "Danshan Temple." The temple was built on a mountain peak on a cliff, even more steep and lofty than Xiaogu Pudu and Jiaoshan. Wang Yangming passed by and had a poem inscribed, which made it famous. When we, sixteen people in the car, departed from Nanchang, we formed a cooperative for travel needs, with Mr. Zeng Shirong in charge. Mr. Zeng and Mr. Zeng Shiying, who created maps for Shenbao, are brothers and look exactly alike. On the first day, I almost mistook Shirong for Shiying. Mr. Zeng is the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Transportation Office and represents the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in this trip, so we have no lack of supplies along the way.

Arrived in Chenxi at noon. Chenxi is located in the mountains, with inconvenient transportation. Residents eat rice at fifteen yuan per dan (a Chinese unit of weight). It was unexpected for us that rice is so expensive in Hunan, a rice-producing area. There are two coal mines attached to the city, one is Huimin and the other is a joint venture. Workers are hired to mine coal, often four or five hundred people using foreign labor system. Delivering a dan of coal earns 280 wen, and each person earns about six or seven jiao per day with their best effort. Many female workers transport coal in the mine, earning about three jiao a day. Chenxi has many mountains and rocks and very little farmland. What little there is can only be planted with sweet potatoes and buckwheat. Now, Huimin Mine has purchased machinery for expansion, but it is still too early to talk about all the equipment in the mine. Chenxi mountains produce Chen oranges, about 70,000 dan per year. The color is golden yellow, quite similar to American San Francisco oranges, and they are very juicy, but slightly sour. If cultivation is promoted, it could also be a local source of productivity. Women in Chenxi carry children in baskets on their backs. This method is very unphysiological. In hot weather, carrying a child and carrying a child means that the body heat of both adults and children is transmitted to each other, which is extremely unhygienic. Now, in Chenxi, children stand in bamboo baskets and are carried on the back, which is very convenient. Also, in the Yuan River in Chenxi, it is common to see boats with waterwheels on both sides and a mill in the middle, grinding flour for people. This boat uses water power instead of manpower and can move around. It can be called "mobile water mill," which is also a reasonable invention. Tao Guang, the commander of the 28th Army, is stationed in western Hunan. Tao and Mr. He Sui were old colleagues in the Guangxi Training Office. Together with Chairman He Yunqiao, they asked Mr. He Sui and Mr. Zheng Yue for several paintings to commemorate their visit. Arrived in Zhijiang in the evening. The city streets of Zhijiang run in four directions, east, west, south, and north, with the drum tower in the center. The total population of the county is 190,000. There are over 7,400 registered opium smokers, and also over a hundred entertainment houses.

### Record of Our Country's Special Envoy Delegation to the UK to Attend the Coronation of the British King

Impressions of Singapore

Colombo Dispatch: The Victoria mail ship carrying the Chinese delegation to the UK to celebrate the coronation of the British King arrived in Singapore at 9:00 AM on April 9th. Welcoming them at the pier were Consul General Gao Lingbai and representatives from 138 Chinese community organizations, with four representatives from each organization. They all held national flags and stood on the pier, waiting for Special Envoy Kong and the delegation to disembark. After everyone disembarked, they took more than a hundred cars prepared by the Chinese community to the Consulate General, rested briefly, and then went to visit Wan Qing Yuan. According to locals, Premier Sun Yat-sen established the Tongmenghui here, and the Blue Sky White Sun flag was created here. The garden covers several acres, with a building in the middle that is now dilapidated. The building has no roof and cannot shield from wind and rain. The compatriots here have collected five thousand dollars to buy this place to commemorate the Premier. Recently, the Central Government has decided to allocate 15,000 yuan to renovate this garden. In the future, all compatriots passing through Singapore should come here to pay their respects.

After taking photos at Wan Qing Yuan, Special Envoy Kong first gave a short public speech at the Tongde Newspaper and Bookstore at the invitation of Kuomintang comrades. Then, he went to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to participate in the welcome rally for the Chinese community. At this time, the venue inside and outside and the surrounding areas were full of welcoming people. When Special Envoy Kong's car arrived, everyone applauded. In his speech at the welcome rally, Special Envoy Kong praised the past achievements of the Singaporean Chinese community and encouraged them to unite sincerely and work hard to develop their own businesses and seek the revival of the motherland. Finally, Special Envoy Kong said that China's efforts in recent years have established a foundation for prosperity and strength. The specific facts will be explained separately by Secretary-General Weng. Special Envoy Kong and Deputy Envoy Chen had already agreed to visit the Singapore naval base with the British naval authorities, so they bid farewell after the speech, but the welcome rally continued. Secretary-General Weng briefly described China's construction in various aspects in the past few years, including detailed explanations of highways, railways, light industry, heavy industry, etc., which gave great comfort to the overseas Chinese who care about their motherland.

The British have spent 50 million US dollars to build Singapore's naval base, and it is still under construction. The British regard this as a forbidden area and prohibit outsiders from visiting. This time, when Special Envoy Kong passed through Singapore, the British authorities specially invited him to visit, which shows that the friendship between China and Britain is beyond superficial relations.

After visiting the naval base, the British Governor specially hosted a banquet to welcome Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, Secretary-General Weng, and various counselors. The rest of the people went to the Singapore Daily to participate in the Bank of China's banquet, which was held at the Nantian Restaurant. After eating Western food on the ship for several days, they were all overjoyed to suddenly eat an authentic Chinese meal. The owner of the Nantian Restaurant is said to be an overseas Chinese, but he has become very indifferent to his motherland after being overseas for many years. During the European War, he personally helped the British with an airplane, but he has not contributed to the construction of the Chinese air force. What methods do we have to reignite their enthusiasm for the motherland for such overseas Chinese? This is a question that those who care about overseas Chinese education should consider.

The wealthy Singaporean merchants, the Hu Wenhu and Hu Wenbao brothers who made their fortune with Tiger Balm, also held a tea party at 3:00 PM to welcome Special Envoy Kong and the delegation. The event was held at the Haw Par Villa in Pasir Panjang. This villa was recently completed and is said to have cost 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. We rarely see such magnificent buildings in the country. Although we have been away from Shanghai for more than a week, passing through many British and American territories, everyone seems to still be traveling in the country, especially in Singapore. Most of the people seen on the streets are Chinese, and there are Chinese shops and Chinese signs. It turns out that four-fifths of the population of Singapore are Chinese. According to business people here, Singapore's economic foundation is built on two commodities: rubber and tin. In the depression era four or five years ago, rubber sold for only five or six yuan per hundred catties, but now it sells for sixty yuan per hundred catties. A few years ago, tin was only worth twenty yuan per dan, but now it sells for more than one hundred yuan (all calculated in local currency). Therefore, people doing business in Singapore this year are very profitable. Overseas Chinese who make a living here have surplus money to send back. According to representatives from the Bank of China, the amount of money remitted back to China by overseas Chinese through the bank from July to December last year was about 15 to 16 million, and in the first three months of this year, 7 to 8 million has already been remitted back. Under this kind of prosperity, the local government has also relaxed restrictions on Chinese immigration. Previously, only 4,000 people were allowed to enter each month, but now it has increased to 6,000, and it is expected to increase to 7,000 soon.

Singapore is a world of overseas Chinese. We only felt like we had truly left China when we left Singapore.

The Victoria mail ship left Singapore at 6:00 PM on April 9th and arrived in Colombo, Ceylon Island, on the night of April 12th. (Central News Agency, April 12th)

### Harbin Almost a World of the Sick

Over 200,000 Patients in a Population of 500,000; Annual Medical Expenses Reach 3.5 Million Yuan

Harbin Dispatch: According to an investigation released by the Health Section of the pseudo-Police Department, approximately 7,000 patients in Harbin City's population of 500,000 were treated by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the past two months, and approximately 202,000 were treated by Western medicine practitioners. In addition, it is estimated that there are as many as 20,000 Korean patients. That is to say, almost half of the city's population of 500,000 is sick. Furthermore, statistics show that the average medical expense per patient is 10 yuan, and the annual medical expense in the city exceeds 3.5 million yuan. These are all shocking figures. As for the diseases contracted, tuberculosis is roughly the most prevalent, and respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, injuries, and venereal diseases are also not uncommon.

### United Match Manufacturing Association Assigns Ueda to Qingdao to Mediate Disputes

Shandong Factory Representatives Fight for Survival; A Small Group Will Be Organized for Mediation Meetings

Qingdao Dispatch: The dispute between the Shandong-Henan Area Match Industry Joint Office and the United Match Production and Sales Association has persisted for years without resolution. It is now learned that the Shanghai United Association has specially dispatched Mr. Ueda, a director and deputy manager of the association, to Qingdao from Jinan on the 28th of last month. He went to the Shandong Area Unified Tax Bureau to negotiate, stating that he was willing to negotiate with the factories that had not joined the United Association with sincerity and requested the bureau to assist him. The bureau immediately convened a meeting of representatives from both sides in the bureau's auditorium at 9:00 AM on May 2nd. Those present included: from the Unified Tax Bureau, Director Tang, Section Chief Wang, and Section Chief Zhao; from the Joint Office, representatives from 20 factories including Huabei, Luxi, and Yuhe; and from the United Association, Director Ueda, translator Liu Qinghong, Chairman Cong Dezi of the Qingdao branch, and Secretary Zhuang Yan. Director Tang first reported the significance of convening today's meeting and the bureau's position, and urged the factories of the Joint Office to set aside their prejudices, negotiate openly, and join the association as soon as possible to avoid a stalemate between the two sides, which would be detrimental to both sides, and also to restore the state of national tax revenue. Then, Ueda stated that he was a third party acting as a mediator to resolve the dispute in the match industry, hoping that the dispute would be settled as soon as possible so that the United Association could operate smoothly and the entire match industry could achieve common existence, prosperity, and welfare. He said that all provinces have joined the United Association, but the 20 factories in your area have not yet joined, and he hoped to eliminate misunderstandings, join as soon as possible, and jointly develop the industry. Next, Deng Songping, the representative of the Joint Office, put forward the common opinions of the factories, briefly stating that the opinions of the factories in this office can be summarized as fighting for survival. Broadly speaking, the articles of association were drafted secretly by a small number of manufacturers and submitted to the government for the record, forcing all manufacturers to join the association and abide by the articles of association, which is unfair in principle. First, foreign merchants were specially allowed to increase production by more than 100,000 cases outside the unified tax records, while our Shandong Chinese factories were subject to a 30% discount on the recorded amount and were restricted and eliminated. If the International Factory only produces one case per day, how can it survive? Second, the share capital is set at 5 million. What is it used for, and what guarantees are there? Furthermore, Shandong factories have limited capital and cannot afford unlimited share capital, making it difficult to continue. Third, the annual expenses are over one million, and there are redundant personnel who waste money, more than a government office. It is directly supplied by the factories, which indirectly increases the burden on the people. It should be clearly defined as an honorary position, with expenses for transportation and meals provided for office work. Fourth, the selection of personnel without an open election by the general meeting of shareholders is already illegal, and moreover, it was secretly agreed upon by a small number of manufacturers and foreign parties as early as September of the 24th year of the Republic. Fifth, the resolutions of the general meeting of shareholders are resolved by the board of directors, and the voting rights of the general meeting of shareholders are calculated according to the production ratio, which are all illegal and unauthorized, causing many abuses. These are roughly the main points. Please consider the detailed written reasons. For a year, we have repeatedly requested but have not been understood. The so-called permission to increase the production of small factories is still a matter of taking from our 20 factories to patch up the holes, which is too ridiculous and the method is close to division. Finally, Ueda proposed organizing a small group for mediation meetings, with representatives elected by both sides for discussion. Both sides strongly agreed. The number of representatives will be determined after returning, and then notified. The meeting location was chosen to be the National Federation of Industries. After the meeting date is agreed upon, a telephone notification will be made. It is expected that after this small group mediation meeting, the dispute that has not been resolved for years may be settled.

### Sui Border Pseudo-Army Units Appear in Border Villages

The Purpose is to Disrupt the Defense Army and Plunder Horses and Property

Zhangbei Dispatch: Recently, there has been a rumor that a certain party has transported a large number of heavy weapons such as tanks to Nanhaoqian from the Rehe area and has ordered the pseudo-army to advance westward, and that the pseudo-army has attacked Sui-East Xinghe and Jining. Judging from the actual situation in Chahar North, this is not entirely true. The information obtained from relevant parties is described below:

From around 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM on the night of April 28th, gunshots and artillery sounds occurred near Nanhaoqian. Also, on consecutive days, intermittent gunshots occurred in various places along the border. According to reliable reports, on the evening of April 28th, about 20 soldiers from Liu Jiguang's unit of the pseudo-army's First Division took advantage of the dim night to sneak near Nanhaoqian, attempting to break in and plunder while the villagers were unprepared. They were discovered by the local security group and immediately fiercely attacked. The defense army heard the sounds and fired cannons to support the security group. The pseudo-army gained nothing and retreated in defeat. The reason is that most of the pseudo-army are cavalry, with a shortage of horses and even fewer possessions. Therefore, they often form small groups of two, three, or ten to appear in villages and towns along the Sui-East border, with the sole purpose of obtaining horses and plundering property. The pseudo-party also believes that allowing the pseudo-soldiers to plunder along the Sui border can also disrupt the national army's defense, so they allow them to do as they please. This is why gunshots have been occurring continuously recently.

This kind of action by the pseudo-army is like the provocative behavior before the past two offenses against Sui, and they are still using their old tricks, so it is worth paying attention to. Fortunately, the Shanxi-Hebei defense army has made sufficient preparations, and the pseudo-party's disturbances are unrelated to the overall situation. As for the pseudo-party's army, apart from occasional troop movements, there has been no increase in troops to the front line, and the military officers sent by a certain party to monitor and guide the pseudo-army have now completely withdrawn, indicating a clear distrust of the pseudo-army. In this situation, it is difficult to transport heavy weapons such as tanks to the front line, and these weapons have already been withdrawn successively after the national army recovered Bailing Temple and Damaozi. At most, they will be transported to western Rehe to wait for an opportunity to launch.

However, a certain party in Dolon lacks an airfield and is now actively expanding the construction. In the past, a certain party thought that Sui-Bao could be taken in one fell swoop, so the airfields in Zhangbei, Shangdu, and Jiabusi were carefully constructed as a base. Therefore, they did not pay much attention to the Dolon airfield. When they met with setbacks in the westward advance, they realized that the Dolon airfield was rudimentary and there was a real need to expand it. In recent days, a certain party has been stepping up the construction of barracks, warehouses, dormitories, etc. Judging from the current situation, it is unlikely that they will launch a pseudo-army westward advance in the near future.

### New Business of Taiwanese in Fuzhou

After Opium Dens Closed, They Changed to Running Usury; Selling Inferior Goods and Occupying the Market

Fuzhou Dispatch: Most Taiwanese living in Fuzhou make a living by opening opium dens, with no fewer than three hundred in the city. For twenty years, they have caused no small harm to society. Recently, because our country has been strictly prohibiting opium, the provincial government has repeatedly made representations to the Japanese Consul in Fujian. The Japanese Consul finally agreed that from March 1st, only 100 opium dens would be allowed to be opened by Taiwanese, and the other Taiwanese who opened opium dens would be ordered to change to other businesses. Those who lack capital would be allowed to borrow money from the Taiwan Association's financial cooperative. After the closure of those foreign-branded opium dens, most of them changed to running usury (called "daily cut" in Fuzhou). The method is to stipulate that each loan is from five yuan to fifty yuan. For example, if you borrow five yuan, you only pay four yuan and five jiao. Starting from the third day, you must pay back five jiao every day, which must be paid off in ten days. If you are in arrears for three days, you will be fined for one day. If you cannot pay, the guarantor will be responsible for paying on your behalf. As a result, in the past month, there have been many signs of "Financial Loan from So-and-So Foreign Firm" on the street. At first, the borrowers were still laborers, so the loans were not very large. Recently, however, merchants below the middle class have also borrowed money from them to alleviate their urgent needs due to poor turnover, and they often borrow from more than one company. As a result, each store often owes five or six hundred yuan to six or seven hundred yuan in principal and interest on foreign debts, making it impossible to repay on a daily basis. Either the goods are moved away and the store closes, or they go bankrupt and flee. In recent days, the Da Xiang Leather Shoe Store and the Guangming Glasses and Clock Store on South Street have all gone bankrupt due to owing too much to those foreign debts. The papers posted in front of their stores all state that the store owes so-and-so foreign firm a certain amount of money. A part of the closed foreign-branded opium dens have changed to running special trade. The goods they sell are mainly silk and satin, seafood, and goods from Jiangsu and Guangdong, mostly inferior goods from a certain country transported from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Because they are cheap, they are very popular. Just taking silk and satin as an example, they are all made of rayon. The wholesale price for foreign firms is only about one jiao and five fen per foot, but the silk and cloth shops sell them to customers for two jiao to three jiao or more, with very high profits. Compared to the cost of domestic Jiangzhe machine-made silk and satin, which is at least five jiao per foot, the difference is huge. Although this kind of goods is not as durable as our country's silk and satin and is commonly called "one-year new," its patterns are novel, its colors are bright, and its price is cheap, so there are many buyers and sales are fast, making it extremely popular. At this time, when spring is late and the weather is warm, and it is the time for people to change clothes, the cloth shops are holding big sales, decorating with lanterns and streamers, and business is very lively. However, what is displayed in their shops is all kinds of inferior rayon goods from a certain country, and no one cares about real silk and satin. Silk and cloth brokers see that these inferior goods are profitable and rush to buy and hoard them from Taiwanese foreign firms to sell to silk and cloth shops later. Therefore, the Fuzhou silk and cloth market has been dominated by goods from a certain country.

### Wuxi

Seven Temples Go to Dongyue Sheng Hui

On the 28th day of the third lunar month, which has been abolished, it is the biggest incense festival in Wuxi. Temples in the city traditionally hold a grand event to go to Dongyue. Now they are preparing separately to compete. There are seven temples participating. The Beidang Fu Temple uses 56 horses and has more than 20 kinds of opera performances.

Thorough Investigation of Disk Losses

The county government was ordered to clean up the booklets of land tax from the years of 1927 to 1935. It was discovered that Zhu Kaiguan, the former director of land tax, had a deficit of up to ninety thousand yuan. A telegram was immediately sent to inform him to quickly find a way to clean it up. Zhu is currently the assistant of the Shanghai fish market, so he sent his student, Yuan, to Wuxi to get around and also to sell his newly built house in Donggulou, to show that there is no money available. The county party headquarters has repeatedly received complaints and has already sent a letter to the county government to investigate the truth, and the county farmers association feels that the inside story is complex, the rumors are rampant, and the public sentiment is angry. Yesterday, it presented the county party headquarters to the provincial party headquarters to request the provincial government to investigate.

### 常熟

Chambers of Commerce Request Tax Reduction

The local Chamber of Commerce, considering that the business tax bureau has been increasing tax rates year by year and merchants are unable to bear the burden, has not only submitted a request to the Department of Finance for a review and reduction, but also the Chamber Chairman Pang Diancai has sent a letter to the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, seeking assistance. He requests that the matter be brought up for discussion at the general membership meeting. His reasons are: ㊀ Income tax has already been levied, and the first category is indeed similar in nature to business tax, amounting to adding structures on top of existing buildings, infringing upon the original capital. ㊁ While it is the inherent duty of merchants to pay taxes, the government should also consider the source of tax revenue when collecting taxes to determine a comprehensive policy on commercial economics.

Arrest of Culprits in Weitian Gate Case

Recent News on the Gu Suming Case

Gu Suming, Chairman of the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, was previously entrusted to travel to Beijing when representatives from silver firms across the country gathered in Shanghai to discuss remedies for the fineness of silver issue. Gu then entrusted Yin Zaiwei (the owner of the local Dahua Evening News) to help. Afterwards, the industry raised 38,000 yuan to pay Yin as a reward. Subsequently, Yin was arrested on suspicion of a certain crime and confessed that the money was given to him by Gu. Therefore, Gu was summoned to Beijing for questioning. Gu has now stated the amount of money collected by the firms in various places. As a result, the Capital Garrison Headquarters has commissioned the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters and local courts to summon relevant businesses to verify the facts. The silver firms in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Ningbo, Rugao, and other places have confessed that the amounts they contributed match. However, the silver firms in Wuxing and Nanjing, fearing involvement, have refused to acknowledge their contributions. Recent news indicates that in addition to the Chambers of Commerce from various places sending telegrams requesting Gu's release, his family is also requesting that he be granted bail.

Discovery of a Sword Used to Resist Japanese Pirates

Jiang Jin, owner of the Datie iron shop in Dongbutou Village, Cibei, recently purchased old iron from various places in Yin and Yao.

The matter has been heard by knowledgeable people, who believe that it is related to the national history of China and plan to ask the Civil Education Hall to purchase it for preservation, in order to preserve historical relics.

### Bone Specialist Dr. Niu Huisheng Passed Away Yesterday Morning

Died of Kidney Inflammation, Funeral on the Eighth, Bequest to Help Hangzhou Guangji Hospital

Bone specialist Dr. Niu Huisheng passed away yesterday morning (the 4th) at 3:00 AM at his residence due to chronic kidney inflammation, which was unsuccessfully treated despite repeated medical interventions. His body will be moved to the International Funeral Home and the funeral will be held on the eighth. Details are as follows:

Orthopedic Master

Mr. Niu was 46 years old. He graduated from Harvard University in the United States early in his life, earning a doctorate in medicine, and was a world-renowned orthopedic master. After returning to China, he served as a professor of orthopedics at Peking Union Medical College for one year. Afterwards, he returned to Shanghai and established the Shanghai Orthopedic Hospital, served as the director of the Red Cross General Hospital, and was a professor at the Shanghai Harvard Medical School and the St. John's University Medical School. He also founded various medical-related social enterprises. During the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, he served as the Surgeon General, traveling throughout the country and contacting church hospitals to provide care for the wounded. Only after the Revolutionary Army captured Beiping did he return to Shanghai to continue running the Orthopedic Hospital. He saved many lives. His contributions to the Party and the country were especially significant. In recent years, in view of the scattered and loose nature of existing medical organizations in China's scientific community, he devoted all his energy to expanding the organization of the Chinese Medical Association and promoting medical research. The academic atmosphere was greatly enhanced. He served as the president of the Chinese Medical Association twice, both before and after its reorganization. He was widely respected both domestically and abroad as a leading figure in the medical field.

Passed Away Yesterday Morning

Mr. Niu worked hard for medical affairs in recent years. Unfortunately, he overexerted himself and suddenly suffered from incurable chronic kidney inflammation. It lasted almost three years, and was treated by hundreds of Chinese and foreign doctors, but although it sometimes improved slightly, it was ultimately difficult to cure. Suddenly, in the past three weeks, his condition worsened and he passed away at 3:00 AM yesterday (the 4th). After the passing of Dr. Yu Fengbin, another great man in our medical community has fallen, causing grief to all who heard the news.

Deathbed Words

During Mr. Niu's final moments, his family was by his side. Mr. Niu was still concerned about medical affairs and earnestly told his family that after his death, all funeral ceremonies should be simple, the coffin should not exceed 400 yuan, and he hoped that friends and relatives would give money instead of flowers. All wreaths and eulogies were declined. All funeral money received should be donated to the Hangzhou Guangji Hospital to enrich the orthopedic equipment.

Funeral on the Eighth

Mr. Niu's remains were moved to the Jiaozhou Road International Funeral Home at 4:30 AM yesterday. Mr. Niu's friends and relatives have organized a funeral committee here. All arrangements are in accordance with Mr. Niu's will, striving for simplicity and avoiding extravagance. The funeral is scheduled for noon on the eighth, with the burial at the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.

Friends and Relatives Pay Respects

After Mr. Niu's remains were moved to the International Funeral Home yesterday morning, various circles in Shanghai, upon hearing the news, went to the International Funeral Home to pay their respects, including Song Ziwen, Liu Ruiheng, Yan Fuqing, Jin Baoshan, Zhu Hengbi, Xu Shihao, Chen Shutong, and hundreds of Mr. Zhu's friends and relatives.

Family Situation

Mr. Niu devoted his life to medical affairs. Although his income was relatively high, he had no savings because he founded various medical enterprises, all of which required money. He is survived by one son, Peter, who is only nine years old and is still studying at the Sino-Western Elementary School. His wife, Niu Xuheng, is also a talented woman who is very enthusiastic about social enterprises. She graduated from Nanjing Jinling Women's University and studied in the United States. In recent years, she has been particularly dedicated to various social enterprises, and women's and children's enterprises.

### Secretary-General of the Pacific Academic Conference Carter Arrives in Shanghai

Praises China's Progress

The English-language "China Press" reports that Mr. Carter, Secretary-General of the Pacific Academic Conference, arrived in Shanghai on Sunday (the 3rd) evening from New York. He plans to stay in China for two months. He stated that China has made considerable progress in both economics and politics in just two years since his last visit. He is coming to Shanghai this time to investigate China's economic and political revival and will visit several provinces and meet with several government leaders. He will meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the end of this week. He has met with him several times before and believes that he is very concerned about the affairs of the Pacific Academic Conference. His visit to China has three major objectives: first, to discuss the location of the Pacific Conference to be held in China in one year. This conference is an international organization of academic conferences, and representatives from the eleven member countries of the Academic Conference will attend; second, to consult with Dr. Hu Shih, Chairman of the China Branch of the Academic Conference, on the research being conducted by the China Branch in conjunction with major universities in China on economic and political issues. This is part of the Academic Conference's program; third, to combine similar research conducted elsewhere with this conference. Mr. Carter also mentioned that the results of the previous conference proved that China's research on economics and politics made a significant contribution to the entire conference and proved that China has made great developments in all aspects of its endeavors recently. As for the location of the next conference, it will be decided by the Pacific Conference next year. It will probably be in the Philippines, Vietnam, or the Dutch East Indies, and will definitely not be in China, because it was already held in Shanghai in 1931. As for Trangxiang Mountain, it has been the location for the conference twice, and its components are less. The conference is held every two years, and about two hundred representatives from the eleven member countries attend. As for whether Manchuria and Mongolia will participate in the conference, there has been no proposal to date. Even if someone proposes it, China will definitely oppose it, and the admission of new members must be approved by all members. Therefore, raising this issue would only increase unnecessary disputes.

### Conflict Between Workers of Two Silk Weaving Factories and Detectives Yesterday Morning

Two Dead, Many Injured

The labor unrest in the silk weaving industry in this city, after the municipal Party and government agencies issued an order to the silk factories to resume work, seemed to be coming to an end. Unexpectedly, a conflict broke out again between the foreman and workers in the Hongchang Silk Weaving Factory on Connaught Road in the west of Shanghai due to the contract system. The contract foremen of the factory, recognizing that they would suffer considerable losses after this processing, united with the foremen of other factories using the contract system to form a machine-guarding group to maintain their own interests, but in reality, it seemed to be hindering the livelihood of the workers. Therefore, after receiving the news, the workers were also invisibly plotting to confront them. At about 0:10 AM yesterday morning, a Hongchang contract foreman suddenly had a quarrel with a worker over a trivial matter, followed by physical violence. At that time, eight workers were beaten by the foremen. The workers in the factory immediately reported to the labor union and notified the neighboring Datong Silk Weaving Factory. At this time, all the workers of the Datong Factory had not yet left work. Upon hearing the news, they immediately gathered more than a thousand people and rushed to the Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau to petition for assistance. The sub-bureau and the municipal Party and government agencies sent personnel to persuade them, and they dispersed. More than five hundred workers, after leaving the police sub-bureau, turned to Connaught Road and went straight to the Hongchang Silk Weaving Factory, gathering at the entrance and refusing to leave, demanding that the factory immediately abolish the contract system. The person in charge of the factory, fearing an accident, urgently telegraphed the Gordon Road police station for protection. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives and volunteers, riding in eleven police vehicles, to suppress the situation. The two sides confronted each other near the triangular field there, but the workers were numerous and vocal, causing a commotion. This led to the intervention of detectives, but the workers still appeared to be surging, forming a confrontation. A conflict eventually broke out, resulting in dozens of workers being injured on the spot and the order was disrupted. At this time, the city Party headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Brigade, etc. all rushed to the scene after hearing the news, trying to mediate and ordering the workers to disperse. The contract foremen who caused the trouble were promised to be investigated after investigation. The workers were satisfied and gradually dispersed, but it was already five o'clock. As for the injured workers, they were sent to various hospitals such as Zhongshan, Red Cross, Labor, and Binlong by the police bureau and police station in batches by ambulance. Among them, Ji Deyuan died upon arrival at Zhongshan Hospital due to a severe waist injury. Another worker from the Meiya Factory, Du Huichang from Shaoxing, 27 years old, also died two hours after being sent to the Red Cross Hospital due to serious injuries. Both were sent to the mortuary for examination. The other injured workers sent to Binlong Hospital included Xu Lanting (50 years old) from the Qungong Silk Weaving Factory, injured in the waist and head, in a very serious condition, and was admitted to the hospital. Guo Xiaolin (30), Yan Asheng (32) were both injured in the head, Shan Hualin (31) was injured in the waist, Wang Ziqing (31) was injured in the head, Wang Laomu (35) from the Wanbin Factory was injured in the face, Shi Shengrong (29), Zhou Fuhua (40) were both injured in the head, Lu Fuquan (38) was injured in the leg, Yan Xiaobin (26) was injured in the head, Yang Aquan (31) was injured in the right eye, Chen Ruyang (21) from the Tianqin Factory was injured in the head, Chen Ayuan (22) from the Datong Factory was injured in the hands and legs, and Jin Adai (46) from the Damei Factory was injured in the head. It is said that the injuries were not very serious, so they were bandaged and discharged. The labor unions of the silk weaving industry in the third district also immediately sent personnel to investigate the names and numbers of the injured workers after the incident and reported the details to the municipal Party headquarters, the municipal government, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting assistance and fair handling, and requesting the municipal authorities to make serious representations to the Municipal Council's police department.

### National Sugar Production and Sales Association Telegrahs Request to Participate in World Sugar Conference

Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry Yesterday, to Facilitate Dealing with Production and Sales Distribution

The China National Sugar Production and Sales Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the matter of the World Sugar Conference distributing the production and sales volume of sugar industries in various countries.

The esteemed Minister of Finance Kong and Minister of Industry Wu,

I have heard that the London World Sugar Conference has decided to organize a permanent World Sugar Management Committee, whose task is to balance and distribute production and sales, as well as other matters relating to sugar. As our country is the second largest sugar market in the world, it is of great importance. I am writing to request that you telegrah the London World Sugar Conference to invite our country to join the association. If our country also obtains a seat on the committee, it will not only be possible to learn more about its affairs, but also, if the association supports the import of sugar into our country, or if there are developments in the national sugar industry, it will be easier to cope with.

I also send this letter to Minister Zha of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry,

Humbly request your approval for implementation.

China National Sugar Production and Sales Association

### Local Association Held Spring General Meeting Yesterday

President Du Yuesheng Delivered Opening Remarks, Huang Renzhi Reported on the Situation in Jiangxi Province

The Shanghai Local Association held its spring general meeting of members at the Zhonghui Building clubhouse at 6:00 PM yesterday. More than 50 people attended, including Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Pang Jingzhou, and Pan Yangyao. After President Du Yuesheng delivered the opening remarks and reported on association affairs, Huang Renzhi reported on the local situation in Jiangxi Province. Details are as follows:

President's Address

President Du Yuesheng said in his opening remarks: "This association's spring general meeting was originally scheduled to be held at the end of March. However, it coincided with the spring holiday, and most of our members were away from Shanghai. Therefore, we postponed the meeting until [blank] day to make it up. Our association now has a total of 241 members. When it was first established, there were only over 80 people. Now, the number has increased more than threefold. With talent gathered together, the association's strength will naturally be more substantial. The future progress of the association's affairs will depend entirely on the joint efforts of all members. The nature of our association originally falls within the local scope, but there are many things in society that may seem easy at first glance, or even unrelated to our association. However, upon closer examination, a small issue in one area can often affect other places, or even a small dispute in one part can affect the overall situation. Shanghai is the center of Chinese and foreign communication and the economic center of the country. Its position is very important. Therefore, the work of our association cannot be divided by region or by nature. We all believe that it is necessary to carefully consider and handle all matters, such as labor unrest, financial issues, and international issues. We must not be too hasty or too conservative, but strive to achieve the right balance. I hope that all members of this association will share responsibility and work together. Today's meeting is a gathering for camaraderie. I offer some opinions, and I ask everyone to discuss them together."

Reporting Items

Based on this, this association submitted a petition to designate Gaoqiao as an experimental zone to take over the Improvement Association. A reply has now been received, and a meeting has been scheduled for the 7th of this month. It has been agreed to send Mr. Wang Huansheng, the general secretary of the Improvement Association, to attend the meeting on that day. ⑸ The Board of Directors reported that the fundraising campaign for aiding Suiyuan has ended.

### Leprosy Patients in Guangdong Province Are Not Being Harmed

According to the Central News Agency, reports from relevant sources indicate that the horrifying news of the massacre of leprosy patients in Guangdong Province is likely due to the segregation of patients based on the severity of their condition as determined by the province's examination. When this news first emerged a month ago, the Central Government immediately telegraphed the Guangdong provincial authorities, instructing them to promptly cease any mistreatment of leprosy patients. Mayor Zeng Yangfu of Guangzhou replied by telegram, stating that leprosy patients had been searched for the sake of public health because the number of patients had increased and they were freely cohabitating with those who had not contracted the disease. Therefore, the police conducted the search purely to protect the general public and not to harm the patients. After arriving in Guangzhou, Chairman Wu Tiecheng of Guangdong Province immediately sought to provide patients with appropriate treatment in a suitable environment. The existing leprosy hospitals were already full and could not accept more patients. Therefore, another leprosy hospital was built on a barren island called Yuanjiangsha near Panyu, covering an area of 800 mu with an allocation of 140,000 yuan. The preliminary preparations have been underway for three months, and it is expected that the new hospital will be able to admit leprosy patients in three months.

### Reduction of Interest Rates by Foreign Banks Has Little Impact on Chinese Banks

Lowering Interest Rates Is a Sign of Market Improvement; Chinese and Foreign Banks Have Different Operating Goals

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, after foreign banks in this city, such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank, reduced the interest rate on current deposits to 1% per week this month, concerns have arisen in all sectors regarding the impact of this move on Chinese banks. A reporter inquired with banking circles about the trend of this issue. It is understood that the purpose of foreign banks in lowering interest rates this time is to enable importers and exporters to use low-interest overdrafts to order goods and develop their respective businesses. Before China implemented the legal tender policy, Shanghai was affected by the global recession, and most industries and businesses were in a difficult situation. To protect themselves, financial institutions restricted lending with high interest rates. However, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, domestic and foreign markets have eased, and the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have successfully stabilized foreign exchange, greatly increasing international credit. As a result, the market has improved, and banks are providing low-interest loans to increase international trade and invest in various construction projects. The reduction of interest rates by foreign banks does not have a significant impact on Chinese banks because Chinese and foreign banks have different operating goals. For example, since the three banks stabilized foreign exchange, the Chinese people are happy to purchase foreign exchange from the three banks. Furthermore, the interest rates on current deposits in Chinese banks are not very high, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications typically offering 2% per week, and other large and small commercial banks generally offering between 3% and 4%. In conclusion, the reduction of interest rates by foreign banks is a good sign of market improvement.

### Navigation Briefing

Shengping Has Not Yet Escaped Danger; Shihe Runs Aground

The Shengping vessel of the Minsheng Shipping Company ran aground off the coast of northern Taiwan. Yesterday, the vessel continued to send telegrams reporting that the rescue equipment had just been transferred to the Shengping vessel yesterday and that it still needs to wait for the high tide (expected to be this Friday or Saturday) before it can be towed away. After being pulled out, it will be sent to the Keelung for repairs. The towing has not yet begun. Rumors of its safe removal are not yet confirmed. The Shihe vessel of the Gongji Shipping Company, loaded with 22,000 bags of salt from Haizhou, heading to the Yangtze River, telegraphed yesterday that it ran aground near the mouth of the Guanhe River on the 3rd of this month. Due to the large cargo and heavy load, it could not free itself. It must now wait until the high tide on the 8th before it can possibly float out of the shoal.

### Ministry of Industry Does Not Approve Tax Exemption for Chinese Cotton Mills

The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association previously submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance requesting exemption from income tax. The Ministry of Finance rejected the request, stating that income tax is levied on those with income and is handled according to general principles.

### Xu Jixin Changes Flight to Shanghai to Next Week

Currently Staying in Hong Kong for Personal Matters

### Japanese Cotton Mills in China Increase Workers' Wages

According to the Shanghai branch of the Domei News Agency on the 4th, the Japanese Cotton Spinning Association in China held an emergency meeting at the Japanese Club on Peng Road in this city at 1:00 PM yesterday. In view of the increase in workers' wages at cotton mills in Japan, the Gonda Cotton Mill decided to increase the wages of workers in its Chinese factories. The meeting yesterday discussed whether other factories should also increase wages. As a result, it was decided that from May 1st, the wages of all Chinese male and female workers in Japanese cotton mills would be increased by 10% of their current wages. Fearing that this move would affect Chinese and British factories, the Japanese Cotton Spinning Association will notify the Chinese Cotton Mill Association and the British Cotton Spinning Company. Currently, the number of workers in Japanese cotton mills in China is 52,000 in Shanghai, 33,000 in Qingdao, 10,000 in Tianjin, and 1,500 in Hankou. As a result of the wage increase by Japanese cotton mills this time, the total income of all workers will increase by 1.7 million yuan per year. If Chinese and British factories also increase wages by 10% in accordance with the Japanese cotton mills, the total income of all workers in the Chinese, Japanese, and British cotton mills will increase by 5 million yuan per year.

### Charity Groups' Disaster Relief Association Transports Second Batch of Relief Grain to Henan

### Citizens of Wusong District Oppose the Levy of Household Donations

Appeal to the Finance Bureau to Suspend the Levy

The Shanghai Finance Bureau recently sent personnel to various districts to investigate and levy household donations on a household-by-household basis, with a deadline of one week for payment. Residents of Wusong District, upon hearing the news, rose up in opposition and flocked to the Municipal Affairs Committee Office and the Eighth District Party Headquarters to appeal and request that the authorities temporarily suspend the levy. They also organized a citizens' association and held a preparatory meeting at the Eighth District Party Headquarters at 1:00 PM yesterday, electing Wu Renqi as the temporary chairman. The main reasons for the opposition were that Wusong District was affected by the January 28th Incident, and the entire town was reduced to scorched earth and has not yet recovered its original state. Furthermore, most residents are unable to repay the housing loans issued by the municipal government in previous years on time. Therefore, they are unable to bear the act of levying household donations. It was resolved to appeal to the Finance Bureau to temporarily suspend the levy of household donations in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.

### Shen Meisheng Dies Tragically from Coal Poisoning

Shen Meisheng, a 30-year-old porter from Hubei Province, lived with his wife, Zhang, in the attic on the second floor of No. 7 Fukang Lane, Jinling Road, Zhabei. On the evening of the 1st of this month, when Shen and his wife were sleeping, they failed to completely extinguish the embers of the coal stove used to cook dinner and placed it in the bedroom, causing both of them to suffer from coal poisoning. It was not until around 8:00 AM the next morning that the landlord, Yang Zhengkang, discovered them. He managed to open the door and immediately sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Anonymous Letter in the Mo Jin-song Case

Inviting Judge to a Nightclub Visit; Court Transfers Defendant for Investigation

Mo Jin-song, a Shaoxing native and owner of the Momo-ji Oil Drum Company on Park Road, residing at 23 Chengxing Lane on Park Road, was accused of seducing and having illicit relations with a fifteen-year-old dancer named Wu Meixiu from the Peach Blossom River Dance Hall in February of this year. Wu's mother, Xu, reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, which prosecuted Mo for rape under Article 221 of the Criminal Code. Mo was repeatedly summoned but failed to appear, leading to an arrest warrant. Mo then surrendered to the First Special Court with his lawyer and was ordered to be detained. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Ri-sheng presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. Both the plaintiff and defendant had lawyers present in court. The judge, considering the case's impact on public morals, ordered the hearing to be closed to the public. After the hearing, Judge Huang Jin-song was denied bail and ordered to remain in detention. The defense concluded, and a sentencing date was set for 9:00 AM on the 6th. However, in the interim, Judge Huang Ri-sheng received an anonymous letter, purportedly from a relative of Mo, urging the judge to show leniency towards Mo Jin-song, grant him bail, and offered a bribe to be paid by a representative who would be wearing a grey Western suit, wearing glasses and had a tin of White Rose cigarettes on the table at the Great East dance hall. Judge Huang, furious upon receiving the letter, transferred it to the prosecutor's office. Consequently, after the case was concluded, Mo Jin-song was transferred for investigation. Prosecutor Zhang Zongru presided over the Ninth Criminal Court and questioned Mo about his repeated failures to appear in court. Mo replied that he was running a central egg factory in Xinghua, and was busy with the business. The court ordered Mo to write the characters "Park Road Mo Jin-song, grateful for labor and concerned, at the Great East Dance Hall, White Rose cigarettes, glasses" for handwriting verification. The defendant's lawyer stated that this was a malicious trick by someone with a grudge against Mo and should be thoroughly investigated. Prosecutor Zhang ordered Mo Jin-song to be detained pending verification.

### Buddhist Association Notice: Protection of Ancient Temples, Pagodas, and Buddha Statues

Attached Copy of the Military Affairs Commission's Reply Telegram: Orders for All Troops to Protect

The Chinese Buddhist Association yesterday instructed all county and city branches nationwide to forward the following to all temples nationwide:

"Regarding the approval of a letter from the Bodhi Society, which states: 'This society has previously seen reports that troops in border areas have arbitrarily destroyed Buddha statues in certain Lama temples.

This greatly hinders the nation's aim of promoting Buddhist studies and preserving ancient cultural art. To prevent such incidents, we have, in the name of our society, sent a telegram to the Military Affairs Commission requesting that they investigate and ban this behavior and make every effort to protect these items.'

We have now received a reply telegram ordering the Ministry of Military Administration to issue a notice to protect these items. In addition to sending the original telegram to the Buddhist Daily, Buddhist News, Buddhist Half-Monthly, and Subtle Sound Monthly for publication to promote awareness, we are also sending a copy of the original telegram to your association to forward to all temples nationwide for their information.

Zhao Guoguang, a native of Taizhou and the owner of the Gongdelin Vegetable Shop at No. 40, Lane 41, Pike Road, married Ge Juqing two months ago. Recently, Zhao learned that his wife was suffering from irregular menstruation, so he bought several doses of a regulating medicine and ordered Ge to take it. On the 14th of last month, Zhao suspected that Ge had not taken the medicine, which led to a dispute, followed by physical violence, causing Ge to be injured. She reported this to the Xinzha Police Station and filed a lawsuit against Zhao in the First Special Court for assault. The court had previously summoned them and advised them to settle out of court. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye Shengchao continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court.

According to the defendant, Zhao Guoguang, after the postponement, Wen Lanting was appointed as mediator, but the plaintiff's conditions were too harsh, so no agreement was reached. Zhao denied beating Ge, claiming that her injuries may have been caused by a fall. The court then advised Ge to drop the lawsuit and return home to live with the defendant. Ge stated that the defendant had instructed her to find a way to die with a knife and rope, so she was unwilling to live with him again, insisting on continuing the lawsuit and filing a civil suit, demanding compensation of 50 yuan for medical expenses. After arguments between the police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, and the defendant's lawyer, Zhu Chengxun, Judge Ye announced that the verdict would be announced this Saturday.

Her mother rushed over and found that her lower body was injured and bleeding. She reported this to the responsible Xinzha Police Branch, who took the ironworker, Chen Genfa, into custody. After questioning him, the police officers, considering the case involved the rape of a young girl, transferred him to the Shanghai Local Court yesterday morning.

### Divorce Case of Ding Shanming and Wife Difficult to Reconcile

Ding Shanming, a local resident, 29 years old, and a graduate of Fudan University, relying on the blessings of his ancestors, opened the Longda Cigarette and Paper Shop on Hongqiao Road. His residence is at No. 4, Deyu Lane, Houjie, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Xiejiao. In 1927, he married Ding Gu, the daughter of Gu Rungui, a wealthy merchant on Hongqiao Road (currently 30 years old). However, Ding Shanming's appearance is unusually ugly, while Ms. Gu comes from a wealthy family, and their lifestyles are completely different. Therefore, Ms. Gu had returned to her parents' home for an extended period. Unexpectedly, she had an affair with Cao Zhongfu, and in January of this year, she stayed at Room 374, Dongfang Hotel, Yu Qiaqing Road, for a month. This was discovered by Ding, who reported it to the police, who took her to the First Special Court. She was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, commutable to a fine.

Therefore, Ding Shanming hired lawyer Gong Wenhuan to file for divorce from Ding Gu in the Local Court. Yesterday, Judge Yu Shiqi continued the hearing. After Ding Shanming presented his account, Ding Gu stated, "I live at Huiyuan Rice Shop, Chengjiaqiao, Hongqiao, West Shanghai. Ding Shanming is my husband. We married on January 8, 1927, and have not had any children. He took concubine Yang Xingmei in February 1929, and she has already given birth to a son. He abandoned me a long time ago. Since he loves another, why can't I love another? That's why I had an affair with Cao Zhongfu, which is true. So, if he wants a divorce, I agree. However, the blame for the extremes of our marriage lies with the plaintiff, who first took a concubine. Therefore, I am submitting a photo of Yang Xingmei and a mourning couplet Ding sent after my father's death, which includes the words 'leading son,' sufficient to prove that he took a concubine and had a son. Therefore, I demand the return of the entire set of rosewood dowry and other jewelry."

Ding replied that he did not recognize the person in the photo and had not taken a concubine. As for the words "leading son," it refers to an adopted son. As for the jewelry, it has all been used up by Ms. Gu through opium addiction over the years. This lawsuit, of course, arose because of Ms. Gu's adultery, so I demand compensation for all my losses.

Thus, there is no problem with the divorce, but both parties want money. The judge tried to mediate, asking both parties to compromise, as unresolved cases can drag on for one or two years through three trials, causing immeasurable losses. After two hours of fruitless negotiation, as both parties insisted on money and could not agree, the case was postponed for another hearing.

### The Tribulations of Lovers Becoming a Couple

Zhang Rufeng's Deep Affection; Zhang Mao's Disapproval

Zhang Mao, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 134, Caishi Road, is a widow with a daughter named Rufeng, currently 18 years old, who is quite beautiful. Living with her is Xie Baoshan from Yangzhou, who has a fellow townsman named Miao Renhai, 27 years old, residing at No. 114, Jiuxiaochang, who makes leather balls for a living and is still unmarried. He often visited Xie's place for casual chats and fell in love with Rufeng. He bribed Xie's wife, Chen, to act as a matchmaker, and they fell in love. On April 12 of last year, he eloped with Rufeng. On February 4 of this year, Rufeng was encountered on the road by Xu Mingchun, a tenant of her mother's, who stirred up a hornet's nest. Xu Mingchun, who had no relationship to the matter, took Rufeng to the police station, who summoned Zhang Mao and released her daughter.

However, Rufeng's feelings ran deep, and she vowed not to return home. She had no choice but to temporarily reside at her aunt Li Zhang's home. On the 12th of the same month, Zhang Rufeng, with her aunt's consent, volunteered to marry Miao Renhai. She went to Miao's house with Xie Cheng to present a marriage certificate and take the bride price of 46 yuan, and they planned to choose a date for the wedding, believing that the lovers would finally become a couple.

But Zhang Mao, the mother, complained to heaven, disapproving of her daughter's choice. She reported this to the police, who took everyone to the local court prosecutor and filed a public lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Bai opened the court.

Miao Renhai stated, "At that time, Rufeng said that her father was dead, and her mother was having an affair. She was working outside and suffering terribly. She volunteered to follow me, and so on."

Zhang Mao stated, "My daughter was seduced and abducted by Xie Cheng, who acted as a go-between, and they dared to privately draw up a marriage certificate without my consent. Therefore, I request a severe sentence and hire lawyer Xu to ask for 200 yuan in consolation money, etc."

Xie Cheng stated, "Li Zhang, Rufeng's aunt, entrusted me to be the matchmaker, and I did not pull the strings," etc.

Li Zhang stated, "I did not entrust Xie Chen to be the matchmaker. Rufeng was at my house and was called out by a woman and never returned until this year."

The court ordered the arguments to be concluded, and the sentence will be announced on the afternoon of the 6th.

### Widow Attempts Suicide by Drowning, Rescued

Jin Deming from Chaozhou, formerly worked in a pawnshop and lived at No. 3, Danshui Road, Public Concession. Last year, due to unemployment and inability to make a living, he committed suicide by swallowing opium. He left behind a wife, Gu, only 24 years old, and three young children. Gu was also pregnant. The family was in an extremely difficult situation. However, Gu was determined to remain chaste. Except for the two eldest sons, who were sent to the free elementary school run by the Chaozhou County Association, she moved to No. 27, Tongli, with her youngest child to save on rent. At the end of last year, she gave birth to another son.

Gu was determined to raise her children to adulthood to have someone to rely on in the future. Her will was firm, and her neighbors praised her. However, her 12-year-old eldest son, Weiqing, suddenly died of illness on the 3rd of this month. Gu was heartbroken and had the idea of committing suicide. The day before yesterday, at home, she tried to commit suicide by hitting her head against the wall. Fortunately, she was discovered by her housemates, but she was already bleeding from her head. Around 6:00 PM, she entrusted her infant to the second landlord and said she was going out for a bit, walked to the Bund Pier on Wuma Road, and jumped into the river to commit suicide. She was again discovered and rescued by Chinese police officers on the pier. Because she had swallowed a lot of water, she was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment.

After receiving the report, the Customs Water Patrol Police Station dispatched detective Li Wenqi to the hospital to inquire about the reason for the suicide and summoned the wife of the former second landlord from No. 3, who was on good terms with Gu, to the hospital to comfort and accompany her home. A missionary at the hospital, feeling that Gu was extremely pitiful, planned to find ways to help her.

The construction of the surrounding wall is nearing completion, and the construction of the ponds in the garden has also begun. On the morning of the 1st of this month, workers excavating the pool suddenly unearthed an ancient bronze round mirror at a depth of about five or six feet below the ground. After reporting this to the on-site supervisor sent by the association, the supervisor sent it to Ye Gongchuo, the chairman of the association, for identification of the age. It is now displayed at the association on Yunnan Road. The mirror is about one and a half feet in length and width, and weighs about ten pounds. The back of the mirror is engraved with the four characters "Hundred Years of Reunion" and figures, etc. The ancient colors are mottled and faintly discernible. According to Ye Gongchuo, the mirror is roughly from the Ming Dynasty or the early Qing Dynasty, and it should not exceed the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, in terms of age, it cannot be considered very old. However, the size and thickness of the object are rare among copper mirrors unearthed in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

### Invite the Children to be Friendly

—Mexico

To what extent China and Japan are currently "friendly" is simply confusing. Japanese ruffians have repeatedly assaulted customs officers, and the "Pan-Pacific Exposition" held in Nagoya lists the Republic of China alongside the "Eastern Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council" and the "Manchukuo Pavilion." Other trivial matters, such as "chatting about the emperor" leading to imprisonment and being punished for throwing pear peels, are too numerous to mention. "If others harm us, we cannot but resist." It seems that "promoting friendly relations" is indeed not easy.

Therefore, some believe that "the friendship between China and Japan should begin with the friendship of the children of the two countries." Children are the future masters of the country. Starting with their childhood, it is natural to "achieve twice the result with half the effort," so to speak "hugging a cat is like hugging a suckling kitten." Moreover, children are innocent and naive. When they sing and dance together, how can they distinguish between "aggression" and "friendship"? This is truly a good "fundamental solution." Now, the authorities of Nagasaki Prefecture and the city authorities have agreed on specific methods. That is, "Each elementary school in Nagasaki City will select ten male and female students as student representatives, who will be led by five teachers on the Nagasaki Maru on May 23 to visit elementary schools in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and return to Japan in early June. After the group returns to Japan, the Nagasaki Prefecture authorities will hold an exhibition at Katsuyama Elementary School in Nagasaki in mid-June or late June, displaying the paintings, calligraphy, compositions, handicrafts, and other achievements of elementary school students from China and Japan for the general public to visit. Nagasaki City will hold a grand meeting of all elementary school students from time to time, inviting students from Chinese schools in Nagasaki to attend. Students visiting China will report on the results of their visits to Chinese schools, and perform singing, music, and dancing to add to the fun."

However, Chinese children are too shy. When they see foreign children playing soccer and fighting in the park, they hide behind people and peek. When they ride tricycles in the lanes, they cry and go home, saying that they were slapped with a "ham" by the foreign children next door. These are children who are accustomed to seeing foreign children in Shanghai. As for the children in Suzhou and Hangzhou, mothers can use the lie that "the Japanese are coming" to trick them into going to sleep obediently. Fortunately, the ten male and female students "selected" by the elementary schools in Nagasaki City this time came with a "mission of friendship," so they are not likely to be clumsy and make Chinese children shy away. Moreover, they are led by five teachers, so it seems that they must do some "friendly" deeds to report back home. This is reassuring for Chinese elementary school students.

However, after the "friendship," they will return to Japan to hold an exhibition, displaying the achievements of students from both countries, and invite overseas Chinese students to attend. Chinese elementary school students used to read "When chaos began, heaven and earth were first established." Now they are reading nothing more than "Little cat meows, little dog jumps." Japanese elementary school students, it is said, already know that "the Three Eastern Provinces are vast in area and rich in products," as well as "the effectiveness of tanks." Comparing the two, it may be that the exhibition will give Chinese children "great stimulation," so they feel that "If others harm us, we cannot but resist." Then "the plan under the support of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since Showa 9" will be completely abandoned!

Inviting the children to be friendly is not working either, so what other way is there?......

### Rainy Night

— Li Xuan

The children are singing at the foot of the mountain:

"It's raining, it's raining, shepherd,

Quickly drive your white sheep into the shed,

Run quickly, the raindrops are loud, the thunder is loud,

Scaring the sheep with nowhere to hide..."

It was already dark, and the torrential rain was sweeping the cliffs like arrows, and the rainwater flowed down through the grass. It poured excitedly on the mountain road, and small splashes of water splashed up in the low-lying areas. Black clouds filled the sky, the wind whistled through the branches, and the old shepherd was still climbing up the mountainside step by step, his raincoat dripping with water, his mouth constantly, loudly, calling out to the lost lambs.

A gust of wind and rain blew in his face, so he hunched down and used his hand to tilt his green straw hat to block the raindrops hitting his face, and then tentatively slipped past a very steep stone slope. Just as he touched a muddy path, a dazzling lightning bolt fell from the bottomless, dark sky, illuminating a dilapidated temple built in the mountain depression. He shouted loudly, stepped on the wet and cold mud road and walked past.

He heard someone groaning softly inside, near the half-closed temple door. He pushed the door open, and there was a dark shadow lying in the corner. The old shepherd trembled his dry fingers and lit a match. The dark shadow looked very weak, shivering and trembling, using a dusty gray garment to wrap something, and then began to cry.

The old man was so startled that he didn't know what to do. After calming down, he picked up the scorched wormwood sticks on the ground, made the fire burn, and walked upwind to the person:

"What are you doing? Alone in the dark..."

The person trembled even more, covering his face with a wide sleeve, his throat seemed to be frozen, and he sobbed and wept, coughing constantly. A thin layer of dry grass was spread on the ground, the grass was stained with something wet, and a layer of dust was scattered on the surface. In the gaps in the soil, watery, red-black blood was revealed. The old man suddenly squatted down as if he had been stabbed, and squeezed the trembling arm with one hand, shaking it continuously twice, saying:

"You: Did you kill someone?"

The person cried out in horror, then threw away the thing in his arms, fell back on the withered grass, coughed dryly and vomited on the ground. Rain poured into the house from the collapsed roof, the wind blew the door open, and the light of the fire was extinguished, the room suddenly turned into a terrifying darkness. The old man groped for a match again and relit it. He held a bunch of freshly lit dry grass tightly, pushed the broken door panel shut, and shone the light on the gray-white little thing rolling in the mud. He shuddered in fear, exclaimed, and when he stretched out his rough palm and stroked the naked, slightly reddish, newborn baby, the little body was already cold, the hair was wet and soft like a newborn lamb, the little mouth was turned down, the eyes were deeply sunken, and the umbilical cord connecting to the mother's body was still attached to the navel...

"Grandpa, please have mercy on me..."

The old man turned around, and the little woman who spoke was already kneeling on the ground. She had a pair of pleading eyes, and tears were falling. She was wearing a gray cloth gown with a large collar, a bare head, and not a trace of blood on her round little face. Tears welled up from the corners of her big eyes like springs. The old man understood everything. He looked at the trembling, pitiful woman and asked:

"Where is the baby's father?"

She lowered her head and cried softly:

"He is a shepherd, I looked for him the day before yesterday, but he had already left the village."

The old man sighed sadly, and he woke up as if from a dream: that young partner, why did he travel far away on a foggy dawn. He touched his wet eyes and shook his head:

"A pitiful little life!"

"I want to go back to the nunnery, I have no way to support him..."

The rain grew heavier, pouring down from the hillside like a rushing stream, jumping over the obstructing rocks. In the dark and gloomy night sky, a flash of cold electric light would occasionally appear, and distant thunder rumbled. A lost sheep, under the dense rain, walked past a puddle next to the grass, bleating, one mournful cry after another.

In the darkness of the earth, the gale and lightning still scattered wildly.

### Treasures Used During the Coronation of the British King

— Te

The royal crowns and other ceremonial items owned by the British royal family are of such great value that they are almost impossible to estimate. These jewels and gold ornaments are usually kept in the Tower of London, and are only taken out for use during coronation ceremonies or formal openings of parliament. It is said that their total value is between 250 million and 300 million yuan. Some of these treasures were obtained in the early Middle Ages. For example, a large ruby on the royal crown, worth about 500,000 yuan, originally belonged to the King of Granada, and was later given to the Black Prince by the King of Castile in 1367. King Henry of England wore this ruby on his helmet during the Battle of Agincourt, and that helmet is now kept in Westminster Abbey.

Among the ceremonial items are Elizabeth's pearl earrings, Edward's large emerald, and a diamond called the "Koh-i-Noor," which is probably the most valuable in the world. It was once set in the crown of the Indian Emperor, and was presented to Queen Victoria by the British army ninety years ago.

The British King has three crowns, one is the Imperial Crown, one is the State Crown used during coronation, and the other is the Indian Imperial Crown. The State Crown worn during coronation is too heavy to be worn for long. It is made of gold and inlaid with pearls, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds. It weighs more than five pounds and is worth about 150,000 yuan. During the coronation, the Archbishop of Canterbury holds it and places it on the King's head.

The Indian Imperial Crown is the newest crown, made in 1912. King George V wore it for the first time at the Indian Imperial Coronation Ceremony held in Delhi that year. It is extremely exquisite and said to be worth 200,000 yuan. It is inlaid with 6,000 diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and sapphires. The most valuable of these is a large emerald and a true pigeon-blood Indian ruby, which is a rare treasure in the world.

There is also the coronation ring, also known as the marriage ring of England, which is put on the King's finger during the coronation ceremony. A new ring is made for each new king's coronation, and the Tower of London now holds three or four such rings. In the center is a large ruby or sapphire, surrounded by large diamonds. This ring is put on the King's finger after the golden orb is presented to the new King. The golden orb represents dominion over the world, and is inlaid with many jewels, with a large amethyst on top, and a diamond cross erected on the amethyst, with a ruby in the center of the cross. No one knows its value.

When the new King sits on the coronation throne in the cathedral after the coronation ceremony, the scepter of St. Edward is placed on his left and right. This scepter is also known as the rod of justice, made of gold and about four feet long. It is said that the original scepter of St. Edward had a cross, but the scepter was lost after Charles I was executed, when Cromwell swept away many royal treasures during the Civil War. The current one is a reproduction of the old style.

The British King has four swords, all inlaid with many jewels, which are also used during the coronation. One is the National Sword of State, worth about 100,000 yuan. It is said that the sword is the most beautiful and valuable in the world. It is made of hardened gold, and the large sapphire inlaid on it is worth 15,000 yuan. The sword is presented to the church by the new King, expressing his sincerity of allegiance. After the church accepts it, the new King buys it back for one hundred shillings. The other three swords are, one is the Sword of Mercy, which has a blunt tip, representing mercy. One is the Sword of Justice, held behind the King by a courtier. One is also the Sword of State, with a lion and a unicorn, representing the guards of the British royal arms. The four swords are all inlaid with gold and jewels.

When the new King performs the coronation ceremony, he holds a royal scepter in his right hand, with a bright glass that looks like a fist on top. It is called the "Star of Africa," and is the largest diamond in the world, which cannot be used for other purposes unless it is cut open. Except for the diamond on the crown and a diamond on display in the museum, this one is the most valuable and cannot be estimated.

In addition, there are golden spurs, presented to the new King by his subjects and placed on the altar of the cathedral, representing that he is offering himself to God as the leader of the British army.

At the climax of the coronation ceremony, a sacred oil is used to anoint the face of the new Emperor, signifying that he has been bestowed with the anointing from God and granted the divine right of all kings. The vessel for holding the sacred oil is a golden eagle standing on a small empty container. In fact, the sacred oil is contained in this small container. This container is relatively new, but the golden eagle is an antique from 1,400 years ago, and a golden spoon that is more than a thousand years old is still used to scoop out the oil. The handle of the golden spoon is inlaid with four pearls, and the design is very unique. People have used various metals to imitate and sell it as a coronation souvenir.

The items used for the Queen's coronation are not as many, but their value is also extremely great. Each time a new Queen is crowned, a new crown is made. This year's Queen's crown is not made of gold, but of platinum, which is a first in British history. The frame of the new crown is the diadem used by Queen Victoria, inlaid with countless jewels, with several large diamonds in the center.
