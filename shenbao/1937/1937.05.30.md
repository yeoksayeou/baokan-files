### The British-Japanese Dispute in Yuguan Resolved Peacefully

The British Restrain Their Troops

[Tokyo] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a simple telegram on the evening of the 28th stating that about 20 British soldiers stationed in Shanhaiguan suddenly attacked the Great Wall Fishing Company at about 9 PM on the 27th. The reason seems to be that some British soldiers had a dispute with people from the "puppet state," so they came to retaliate to vent their habit. The "puppet state" authorities immediately protested to the British military authorities. The British side admitted that it was wrong and apologized immediately, so the incident has come to an end. (Allied Telegram on the 29th)

[Tianjin] According to Qin Island, the incident of the conflict between the British stationed in Yuguan and the Japanese bridge was resolved peacefully on the 28th through negotiations between the chief of the puppet state border police team, the puppet state foreign affairs officer, the captain of the Japanese military police team, and the British captain.

The alert was not lifted until the resolution on the 28th. (Special Dispatch on the 29th)

### The Intention of Changing Kilograms to Jin in the New Salt Law

Promote the Implementation of the New Salt Law and Equalize the Burden of the People

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance stated that the issue of changing the word "kilogram" to "jin" in the new salt law regarding the collection of salt tax was previously resolved by the Central Political Committee and is being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. Recently, outsiders do not understand the truth and have made many proposals. The reporter specially inquired about a certain person in the Ministry of Finance, who replied that the intention of this ministry to change the word "kilogram" to "jin" in the salt law is to promote the implementation of the new salt law on the one hand, and to equalize the burden of the people on the other hand. Because the current salt tax rates in various regions are as high as more than ten yuan per shi dan (unit of weight) and as low as more than one yuan, the salt tax rates are very inconsistent, and the burden on the people is also very uneven. It should be gradually balanced according to the actual situation. The new salt law stipulates that the tax is five yuan per 100 kilograms, which is equivalent to two yuan and five jiao per shi dan, which is only a quarter of the current highest tax rate, which is too far apart and difficult to implement suddenly. It is better to change kilograms to jin, so that there is a close standard between the highest and lowest tax rates. Although there is a slight increase in the low-tax areas, the tax has been reduced in the high-tax areas. Moreover, there are more high-tax areas and fewer low-tax areas in the country. Such a transfer and adjustment will cause losses to the national treasury, but in terms of the people, the burden has actually been equalized. Outsiders do not understand the truth and think that changing "kilogram" to "jin" is equivalent to increasing the burden on the people, which is very ignorant of the facts. Furthermore, comparing the recent salt tax revenue and the amount of salt sold, not only has the burden on the people not increased, but it has also been reduced. In recent years, the salt tax has been reorganized repeatedly, and the income has increased year by year. The salt tax revenue in 1936 was the highest, reaching 200.5 million yuan. The amount of salt released in 1931 was the highest, with 29,399,000 dan of edible salt released. According to the new salt law, the tax is five yuan per 100 kilograms, and the annual salt tax can only be 98,497,000 yuan, which is less than half of the highest amount collected in 1936. Given the current state of the national treasury, a sudden reduction in this huge amount would not only make it impossible to pay for the original uses, but also make it impossible to raise the funds recently allocated from the salt tax for various important constructions. This ministry plans comprehensively and cannot but find an appropriate solution between the legal tax rate and the current tax rate, so that the current tax revenue will not be affected while reducing the burden on the people, so as to consolidate the foundation of the national finance. Therefore, please change "kilogram" to "jin," that is, calculate the tax at five yuan per 100 jin, which is not only not increased at all compared with the highest amount of income in 1936, but is still reduced by 10 million yuan per year. In other words, the burden on the people is reduced by 10 million yuan per year, and there is no increase at all. Outsiders do not realize that changing kilograms to jin is equivalent to doubling the salt tax, but they have not compared the current tax rate with the amount of tax revenue and salt released.

### Japanese Armed Ronin Forcibly Occupy Tianjin Branch Cards Every Night

Assaulting and Humiliating Customs Officers and Smuggling Contraband; The Authorities Have Filed Two Protests

[Nanjing] Regarding the case of Japanese ronin carrying weapons, occupying the Xiaoximen branch card belonging to the Tianjin Customs at midnight on May 12, smuggling contraband in ten trucks to evade taxes, and kidnapping customs officers and police captains, the authorities have filed a serious protest to the Japanese Consul General stationed in Tianjin, but no results have been achieved. According to recent reports, since the Xiaoximen branch card was forcibly occupied by Japanese ronin once on May 12, armed ronin have been arriving every night at one hour past midnight, escorting seven to nine trucks loaded with smuggled goods. When they arrive at the branch card, they get out of the car and forcibly occupy the branch card, searching the branch card and the vicinity, intending to assault and provoke customs officers, and then escort the cars to the agreed location, hand over the goods to others, and transfer them to the interior for sale.

### Air Tensions in Chahar Province, Internal Changes Among Bandits and Puppet Troops

Chang Ziyi Regiment Rebels, Shooting Down a Japanese Plane

[Zhangjiakou] Due to disagreements within the puppet Chahar government and each faction seeking self-preservation, the long-touted westward offensive has not materialized.

In the Chifeng-Duolun area bordering Rehe and Chahar, they joined forces with bandits from Rehe and rose up in revolt. Coincidentally, two Japanese instructors were flying from Zhangbei to Rehe.

### On the National Defense Line (9)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di

Our conversation began with Mr. Zhao. After a few pleasantries, he spoke of his recent ailments. Humbly, he said he felt very uneasy about not being able to personally host the guests who had come from afar. Here, he turned to the reporter's friend and said:

"Please entertain them well."

Taking advantage of a slight pause in his words, I quickly said a few words to express my respect. Mr. Zhao smiled, gently and kindly.

"I am merely helping Mr. Yan with some tasks."

Then, the reporter spoke to him about Mr. Yan's advocacy of "distribution according to labor" and "property certificates." Here, his voice immediately rose somewhat. He said that the origins of these two ideas, in terms of academic theory, still came from the teachings of China's ancient sages and worthies. Then, he cited the names of books and even recited entire passages from the original texts. These places fully demonstrated his profound knowledge of Chinese studies. I listened attentively, watching his increasingly excited expression, and a nameless admiration welled up in my heart: a person of such advanced age and high moral character, yet so steadfast and concerned about world affairs! He spoke at length on this topic to this newspaper's special correspondent, Shu Di. And finally,

"In reality, they are merely individual ideas," he added with extreme humility. However, from his tone, the reporter keenly perceived the depth of his understanding with Mr. Yan.

The topic then turned to the "Advocate Fairness Corps" organized in Shanxi in the past two or three years. Here, Mr. Zhao's words flowed again. He recited the two slogans of the "Advocate Fairness Corps" to the reporter, word by word: "Support good officials, good gentry, and good people." "Sanction bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people." -- while using his fingers to gesture up and down in the air, as if pointing to a couplet.

"The greatest purpose of this organization is to rectify officialdom and sanction bad officials," Mr. Zhao said.

In short, Mr. Zhao, who held the position of Deputy Head of the Corps, explained that the organization was not so much a social movement as it was an organization for supervising officialdom. It was not so much an organization for training in the rule of law as it was an organization for promoting morality.

At this moment, I suddenly thought of Mr. Zhao's physical discomfort, and also worried that it had been too long, and was hesitating about saying goodbye; however, he asked me about the various situations after arriving in Shanxi: What had I seen? What did I plan to see? Where was I staying? ...... etc., I answered one by one, and in my heart, I had this feeling: This is a kind of concern and consideration that has the temperament of a political official, and also has the breadth of mind of an elder!

In order to avoid him talking too strenuously, so, when his conversation came to another paragraph, I gave my friend a look, and we got up together to say goodbye.

Mr. Zhao sent us out of the cotton door curtain, down the steps, and through a courtyard, and over a six-bar barrier, and down a stone step with several very high steps, until he stopped after taking the lowest step, and shook hands with the reporter to say goodbye. (Before reaching here, I asked him to stop many times, all to no avail: even my friend, he helped me ask him to stop, and said: Let me send you off, let me send you off. did not work either.)

Mr. Zhao nodded with a bent waist, and put his hands together in front of his chest, and instructed our friends:

"You accompany me on my behalf." - He cupped his hands at the reporter, and the prayer beads shook in front of his chest. "You accompany me on my behalf." - He bowed to the reporter again, and the prayer beads shook in front of his chest again.

Whenever I think of the shaking prayer beads and Mr. Zhao's bowing posture, I will immediately think of his whole attitude of amiable modesty.

"The old gentleman is so humble and cautious with everyone and everything," my friend Huailai told me.

### A Provision That Should Be Included in the Draft Constitution

— Wu Qiyu

Since the publication of the draft constitution, the most important criticisms from the dissatisfied side have generally been the following two points, namely: ㊀ The draft constitution stipulates at the beginning that "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People" and nominally implements a five-power system, fully indicating that the constitution is a product of the Kuomintang, making it difficult for other parties to participate; ㊁ The system in the draft constitution has too much of a flavor of a powerful government and too little of a democratic component, and the protection of civil rights is insufficient. These criticisms each have their own theoretical value. But from another perspective, the "shortcomings" they have put forward seem difficult to change at present. The reason is that laws cannot deviate too far from reality. In some cases, laws can create new facts, but in the usual cases, laws can only recognize facts and maintain the status quo. We only need to look at the constitutions of the newly emerging countries after the war, none of which can escape the actual background at the time of drafting and the flavor of the ruling party, and we can understand. Even taking our country as an example, since the establishment of the National Government, all fundamental laws cannot escape this scope. Only in this way can laws always be effective and lasting. Otherwise, it will naturally not work if the law is completely separated from the facts. Discussing the draft constitution based on this principle, since our current politics is a politics of the Kuomintang's dictatorship, and the government is in fact a powerful government, then it may not be the most practical and easiest to implement method for the draft constitution to add a higher legal recognition. So as far as the present is concerned, I personally would rather agree with this method.

But even so, we must pay attention to the other side. That is, the social environment and facts are constantly changing. Today, because of historical reasons, the Kuomintang is indeed the ruling party, and because of the double pressure of internal and external troubles, a powerful government is indeed needed. But what will the situation be like in the future? I am afraid only God knows, and no one can say "it can be known even after a hundred generations." So no one can guarantee whether today's draft constitution will be suitable for the situation a hundred years later, or even fifty years or thirty years later. Or perhaps some people say that with regard to this point, Article 146 of the draft constitution already has provisions for modification, and it seems not too difficult as long as more than one-fourth of all representatives of the National Congress propose it, more than three-fourths of the attendees are present, and more than two-thirds of the attending representatives pass a resolution. But I think it is not enough for us to rely only on this mere modification provision. The reason is that the so-called ordinary modification is limited to the modification of local clauses and has little impact on the overall spirit or system of the constitution. And it can only be passed when it is absolutely necessary. So if we hope to use this method to make some fundamental reforms, such as changing from a powerful government to a democratic government in the future as the environment changes, I am afraid there will be great difficulties. Precisely because of this, I think we must think of other methods besides ordinary modification to make fundamental modification easier and more possible.

Since ordinary modification is not enough to satisfy our desires and cannot cope with future changes, the so-called other method is naturally a provision for complete revision. In fact, this method has long been implemented in some of the states of the United States, and the Polish constitution after the European War also has similar provisions. The implementation results are very good. So I think we really have the value of reference and adoption. As for his methods, they are no more than the following three types: ㊀ Mandatory periodic revision, that is, stipulating in the constitution that it should be revised every so many years; ㊁ Periodically soliciting voters for whether there is a need for revision; ㊂ Using the method of initiative and referendum to decide whether there is a need for modification; and ㊃ The government decides whether there is a need for modification. Among these methods, I think the first method seems to be the most appropriate. The reasons are: ㊀ Within a certain period of time, it guarantees the stability of the constitution and the government's position, so as not to shake it. ㊁ At the same time, it can give the constitution an opportunity to experiment, to see whether the results of implementation are in line with the environment of the times and whether there is a need for modification. In other words, this method takes into account the stability and change, the position of the current power faction, and the future social environment, and is completely a method of experimentation. So I think it is a relatively good method. Now that the National Congress is about to be held, I hope everyone will pay attention to this issue.

Finally, what I want to say is that if this method is well stipulated, there will be no drawbacks. Some people may think that this method will ㊀ reduce the dignity of the constitution: ㊁ cause unnecessary trouble, but in fact, it is not so. First, the dignity of the constitution is entirely based on whether it can be in line with the environment and whether it can be followed by people, and not on the condition that it is difficult to modify. And if the constitution is really suitable for the environment, and the experiment has good results, according to the principle that real gold is not afraid of fire, the revision meeting will definitely not be easy to change. On the contrary, a constitution that is difficult to modify will make people violate the law, insult the law, and even destroy the law. Second, as long as we set the revision time a little longer, such as twenty-five or thirty years, this trouble will not occur. Even if it is not, I think this trouble is worth it. It is always much stronger than the constitution being out of step with the times, resulting in various malpractices, or causing a revolution.

### League of Nations Passes Resolution on the Spanish Issue

Hoping All Countries Withdraw Combatants, Both Sides in the Conflict Must Not Bomb Civilians

[Geneva] The Council of the League of Nations held its final meeting today and passed an important resolution on Spain. In addition to declaring that the participation of non-Spanish people in the Spanish civil war poses a real danger to peace, it also reaffirmed that all member states of the League of Nations have the obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political autonomy of another country. The Council also expressed its deep regret that the steps taken by various countries in response to the League of Nations' call have not been sufficiently effective, but it expressed satisfaction with the initial measures taken by the Non-Intervention Committee to address the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, and hoped that it would soon bear fruit. Since this fact is the most important part of the principle of non-interference in the Spanish civil war, it is hoped that the war in Spain can be ended soon as a result. Furthermore, the resolution of the League of Nations considers the methods used in the Spanish civil war, such as the bombing of cities without protection, to be illegitimate, and expresses its admiration for the governments and public organizations of various countries engaged in the relief of Spanish women and children. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 29th)

[Geneva] Regarding the issue of domestic unrest in Spain, the Council of the League of Nations unanimously passed a resolution at noon today, expressing its agreement with the suggestion put forward by the Non-Intervention Committee's Adjustment Committee that foreign volunteers should withdraw from Spain, stating that "the situation in Spain is sufficient to endanger general peace, and the most effective way to deal with it, that is, the best way to implement the policy of non-intervention, lies in the withdrawal of foreign volunteers." Later, it mentioned the tragic bombing of ordinary people in Spain by aircraft and condemned it, stating that the proposal by the government of a certain country to withdraw Spanish women and children is a good deed. The main points of the resolution are summarized as follows:

㊀ The Council of the League of Nations passed a resolution on December 12 last year, stipulating that all member states should respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other countries. It is regrettable that the measures taken by the countries concerned have not achieved the expected results.

㊁ The monitoring plan for non-intervention measures was implemented in March, and it is hereby placed on record.

㊂ The Non-Intervention Committee's Adjustment Committee recently suggested withdrawing foreign combatants, which should be approved and implemented quickly.

㊃ The Council hereby requests that all member states of the League of Nations strive to support this proposal so that it can be implemented.

㊄ The Council hopes that this effort will achieve rapid results so that the Spanish civil war can be quickly ended and the Spanish people can decide their own destiny.

㊅ All combat methods that conflict with international law, especially the use of aircraft to bomb undefended cities, are not welcome by the Council.

㊅ The Council hereby expresses its approval of the recent efforts by a certain country and its unofficial organizations to relieve the ordinary people of Spain. The representative of the Spanish government, Valyut, stated that he accepted this resolution and said that the Council's attention to the issue of domestic unrest in Spain, especially the withdrawal of volunteers, was deeply appreciated. He also said that although progress has been made since the implementation of the policy of non-intervention, Italy and Germany are now continuing to send army troops to Spain to interfere in domestic unrest, and the number of these troops is very large, which is an act of aggression against Spain. It is especially inappropriate for certain parties to refer to both the legitimate government of Spain and the rebels as parties to the Spanish civil war, and a protest is hereby lodged. (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)

[Geneva] The Council of the League of Nations passed a resolution at a secret meeting last night, stating that the League of Nations would issue a declaration that any non-Spanish people participating in the Spanish civil war are a real danger to peace. This resolution will be submitted to the Council's open meeting tomorrow, advocating that these volunteers should be withdrawn immediately, and expressing regret over the bombing of undefended cities and civilians. Prior to this, the Council held an open meeting, in which representatives from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Spain, and other countries delivered speeches. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 28th)

### Speeches by Representatives of Various Countries at the League of Nations Assembly

Spanish Representative Accuses Italy of Interference; Britain, France, and Russia All Appeal on Humanitarian Grounds

[Geneva] The Council of the League of Nations held an important meeting at 5:00 PM today to discuss the Spanish issue. The representative of the Spanish government, Mr. Alvarez del Vayo, delivered a lengthy speech, first stating that the Spanish government had filed a complaint with the Council last December regarding the blatant interference in the Spanish civil war by certain foreign countries. Although the Council unanimously passed a resolution demanding that all member states strictly adhere to the commitment of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, the problem of foreign interference in the Spanish civil war had not been resolved. Since then, a series of significant incidents have occurred, such as Italy and Germany intensifying their interference in the Spanish civil war, the slow implementation of the Non-Intervention Committee's monitoring plan, the bombing of Guernica, the former capital of the Basque region, and the London Adjustment Committee's recent efforts to withdraw volunteers from Spain. Mr. Alvarez del Vayo detailed these events, stating that the Spanish government had decided to submit a white paper to the Council, containing dozens of documents that clearly proved: (1) there are entire units of the Italian army within Spain; (2) these units are freely operating within Spain; (3) the Italian government has established institutions in certain Spanish territories as if those places have been conquered by Italy; (4) the highest Italian officials are actively participating in the activities of these units. The recent capture of numerous German soldiers by the Spanish government forces, all carrying gas masks, further indicates that the rebels will engage in chemical warfare as a last resort. Mr. Alvarez del Vayo then stated that the plan to withdraw volunteers from Spain treats those who freely came to Spain to help fight the war the same way as the armed forces sent by the dictatorial governments to wage war, which is not what the Spanish government wants to hear. However, the Spanish government still accepts this plan without reservation. "The war currently taking place in Spain was not caused by the Republican government, but the Republican government now has a strong army that is undoubtedly capable of winning. This is something that some people should acknowledge and admit that their observations have been wrong. As for the issue of mediating the Spanish civil war, there is only one form of mediation: that the international community must respect the legitimate and autonomous government of Spain. The Spanish government believes that the League of Nations has the authority to resolve the entire problem of foreign interference in the Spanish civil war. If the Council refuses to take a firm decision and necessary measures, it will be an irreparable mistake," he said. Mr. Alvarez del Vayo concluded with impassioned words, urging the Council to adopt a firm stance, saying, "Time is running out; today may be the last chance for the Council to take a firm stance."

French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos then spoke, expressing sympathy for the suffering experienced by the Spanish people and explaining that the Spanish civil war has gradually acquired an international character, posing a serious threat to European peace. France, in view of this, initiated the Non-Intervention Agreement, which has had considerable effect. It would be unfair if we did not recognize this. We are also deeply convinced that the effectiveness of the Non-Intervention Committee's monitoring plan will gradually increase. At this moment, the Council of the League of Nations has two responsibilities: one is to urge both parties involved in the Spanish civil war to respect the most basic rules of humanitarianism, and the other is to find ways to withdraw volunteers from Spain, because the existence of these volunteers will prolong the civil war and expand its scope. The London Adjustment Committee is currently working on these two responsibilities and has issued a solemn appeal, which all parties concerned should listen to. It is hoped that the entire Council will unanimously support the Adjustment Committee so that the Spanish people can independently decide their national future."

Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov spoke next, declaring that the territory of a member state of the League of Nations has now been invaded by foreign troops. What the Council is dealing with is this obvious act of aggression. "According to the intentions of foreign aggressors, they want to force a political system that is completely incompatible with the national conditions of Spain on the Spanish people. If this attempt succeeds, others will surely follow suit and instigate rebellions in other countries. Spain should have a government that is needed by its people. The ideal on which our government is based, although different from other countries, has never attempted to force other countries to adopt the same political system. I now hope that the Council will respond to the complaint filed by the Spanish Republican government. If it stands idly by, the League of Nations will inevitably fall into spiritual and material ruin," he said.

British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden then spoke, refuting some accusations against Britain, saying that Britain has done its best to rescue the Spanish people and prevent them from suffering the ravages of war. The fact that as many as 25,000 Spanish refugees have been transported out of the country by British ships is clear evidence. The Non-Intervention Committee's monitoring plan has made some progress recently. "However, if there is one foreign volunteer left in Spain for one day, then the European countries cannot be satisfied for one day. The British government opposes foreign interference in the Spanish civil war without reservation. This kind of interference is not beneficial to any country, because once the Spanish civil war is over, the Spanish people will certainly hate the foreigners who participated in the destruction of Spain." Mr. Eden then mentioned the negotiations conducted by Britain on the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, saying that the British government believes that it is impossible to withdraw volunteers unless the parties involved in the civil war cease fire. Therefore, it has inquired about the opinions of the countries concerned on the issue of ceasefire. So far, several countries have submitted replies, the content of which is sufficient to prove that it is not impossible to reach an agreement. Mr. Eden concluded by saying that the Council should now support the work of the London Adjustment Committee so that the withdrawal of volunteers can be facilitated. Finally, representatives from New Zealand and Sweden spoke in succession, their arguments being roughly the same. The Council then adjourned and will continue to meet tomorrow morning to discuss the matter. Representatives of the member states of the Council then held a closed-door meeting to draft a resolution, which reportedly contains two points: (1) supporting the withdrawal of volunteers advocated by the London Adjustment Committee; (2) advocating the humanization of the Spanish civil war. (Havas News Agency, Geneva, 29th)

### Russia Submits Reply to British Proposal

Ambiguous

[Moscow] Regarding the British proposal of May 17 to jointly urge the Spanish belligerents to temporarily cease fire in order to recall foreign volunteers, Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin delivered the Soviet reply to the British Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union on May 27. The reply stated, "The Soviet government has carefully considered the above-mentioned issue and believes that it is not appropriate to request a temporary ceasefire from both the legitimate government of Spain and the rebels in order to recall the above-mentioned volunteers before an agreement has been reached on the issue of recalling volunteers. At the same time, the Soviet government has doubts not only about the timing, but also about the effectiveness of the above-mentioned request. The reasons are as follows: First, it is obviously unreliable whether the rebels can faithfully abide by their promises, because they have colluded with certain countries to wantonly destroy the most basic principles of humanity and law, for example, the destruction of the undefended city of Guernica, which is a clear and well-known proof to the whole world. Second, the Soviet government also recalls that in the past, during the war between Soviet Russia and the White Russian rebels and interventionist forces, the results of this request completely failed. However, the Soviet government, because it is extremely willing to do everything possible to promote the recall of foreign volunteers, including foreign regular troops, and to quickly stop the continued killing, is currently still prepared to participate in the joint request so that the war can be temporarily suspended in order to implement the withdrawal of volunteers." At the same time, the Soviet government, because it cannot recognize the Spanish government and the rebels as equal groups, believes that the following fair conditions should be put forward, that is, the rebels who first took military action against the legitimate government of Spain in the past should also first stop fighting the Republic this time and first start withdrawing all their foreign troops, including Moroccan troops. Without this prerequisite, the result of a temporary ceasefire will inevitably intensify the Spanish civil war, thereby benefiting the rebels and harming the legitimate government of Spain.

### Japanese Cabinet's Opinions on the Current Situation Are Quite Divided

Difficult to Resign or Persist; Unwilling to Succumb to Political Parties

[Tokyo] The Japanese cabinet's differences of opinion on the current situation have become apparent today. Since yesterday's cabinet meeting, these differences have widened. It is reported that Sugiyama, Yuki, Shiono, and Sato are strongly advocating that the government should firmly maintain its current position in order to deal with the new parliament. On the other hand, Kawahara, Yamazaki, Kodama, and Yonai believe that now is the time to reconsider the environment and decide whether to resign. Prime Minister Hayashi undoubtedly sympathizes with the former, but as far as the entire current cabinet is concerned, it seems to lack confidence in overcoming the enormous difficulties. However, all cabinet members seem to be united in the view that resignation would be tantamount to succumbing to the power of political parties. (Central News Agency, 29th)

The new Minister of Public Works is Sir Sassoon, who was the Under-Secretary of Aviation in the previous cabinet. The new cabinet has 15 Conservative Party members, 4 National Liberal Party members, and 2 National Labour Party members. There are many changes among the junior cabinet members. There are only two new people in the new cabinet, one is the Earl of Walber, the Under-Secretary of the Colonies, who is now the Lord Privy Seal, and the other is Mr. Burgin, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, who has now been changed to Minister of Transport. The cabinet members in the Baldwin cabinet who remain in their original positions in the new cabinet are as follows: Lord Chancellor Hailsham, Foreign Secretary Eden, Secretary of State for India and Burma Zetland, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald, Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, Secretary of State for Air Swinton, Secretary of State for Scotland Elliot, Minister of Health Kingsley Wood, Minister of Agriculture Morrison, Minister of Labour Ernest Brown, Minister for Coordination of Defence Inskip. Eight former cabinet members have been reassigned to new positions: Prime Minister Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Home Secretary Hoare, Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper, President of the Board of Education Stanhope, Lord President of the Council Halifax.

[London] The number of seats held by the three government parties in the Chamberlain cabinet is the same as the number of seats held in the previous Baldwin cabinet, so the Chamberlain cabinet has completely maintained the status quo in terms of the balance of power among the parties. In addition, among the cabinet members, Prime Minister Chamberlain is the oldest, at 68 years old this year, while Foreign Secretary Eden is 40 years old, Lord Privy Seal Earl Walber is 37 years old, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald is 36 years old. They are the youngest. According to political figures, Prime Minister Chamberlain will base his diplomacy on the "imperial concept" and abandon the policy of "splendid isolation." He has strongly stated to the representatives of the various autonomous territories that Britain should not only pay attention to its own security, but also to the security of other parts of Europe, west of the Rhine. Regarding this point, the retention of Foreign Secretary Eden is quite relevant. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

[London] Chamberlain's new cabinet is now being praised by all parties. The Times said that those who have been promoted to new positions in the cabinet are all extremely competent. There are very few new figures entering the cabinet, but they are all talented. However, some cabinet members have been transferred from one department to another, and there is no obvious reason for this. Some members have gained extensive experience in the process of military preparation and are about to be able to use their abilities, but now they have been suddenly transferred to other positions. It is not known why this has been done. There is no political emergency at present that requires this transfer, and the country is in a time of trouble, so it seems inappropriate to easily make this transfer. The Daily Telegraph said that Chamberlain's assumption of the premiership is easy and familiar, and the whole country is united. The direction of the government's actions can be guaranteed not to change. The Morning Post said that Chamberlain's assumption of the premiership has won the full trust of the Conservative Party, which is now at the helm of British politics and has the support of the whole country. However, the newspaper expressed its surprise at the transfer of Home Secretary Hoare. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 29th)

### British House of Commons Passes Divorce Law

No Divorce Allowed Within Five Years of Marriage

[London] The House of Commons today passed the marriage bill by a vote of 190 to 37, stipulating that no divorce is allowed within five years of marriage, and adding two items to the current reasons for allowing divorce: abandonment for three years and incurable mental illness for five years. The bill has now been sent to the House of Lords for discussion. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 29th)

### Sanjak Issue Completely Resolved

Franco-Turkish Agreement Signed

[Geneva] The Turkish and French delegations signed an agreement at 10:00 AM this morning, stipulating that the territorial integrity of the Sanjak region (i.e., the two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch within Syria) and the borders between Syria and Turkey should be guaranteed by France and Turkey. The Sanjak issue is hereby declared resolved. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

### France and Germany Decide to Conclude Commercial Treaty

Can Be Signed Within Half a Month

[Paris] Prime Minister Blum held talks with German Economics Minister Dr. Schacht this afternoon, which lasted for an hour. Complete compromises have been reached on the main issues concerning the signing of a commercial treaty between France and Germany. Therefore, the commercial treaty between the two countries is expected to be formally signed within half a month. In addition, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce, the talks held by German Economics Minister Dr. Schacht and French Commerce Minister Bastid in the past few days have been sufficient to resolve all major difficulties, which is gratifying. The French and German governments now further declare that negotiations between the two countries on drafting the final text of the commercial treaty have already made a start and can be formally signed in the near future, so that the commercial and financial relations between the two countries can be stabilized. It is generally believed that the terms that have been determined in the commercial treaty negotiations between France and Germany stipulate that Germany should purchase various French products, and France should also purchase the same amount of goods from Germany. As for the interest on the Dawes and Young loans, it will probably not be reduced. In addition, the commercial treaty should also have provisions on new methods of offsetting accounts. Once the date for the signing of the commercial treaty between France and Germany is set, Schacht will come to France again to represent the German government to sign the treaty. As for the new travel agreement between France and Germany, it has been set to take effect on the first of next month. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

### Steelworkers and Police Clash in the United States

Ten Injured in Total

⊙Chicago: A clash occurred in the steel strike today. About 1,000 striking workers fought with 200 police officers at the Republic Steel Corporation's South Chicago plant. Six police officers and four workers were injured. The clash was caused by the striking workers' decision to hold a rally and then go out to picket the factory. This was prevented by the police, and the workers threw bricks and stones, leading to a fight. Four workers have been arrested. According to the Republic Company's authorities, 1,000 workers are still continuing to work in the factories, and their output accounts for 40% of normal. Workers inside the factories have been supplied with food by airplanes. However, Murray, chairman of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, said that among the workers on strike in various factories, there are 23,000 workers at the Perston Steel Plate and Pipe Company, 11,500 at the Inland Company, and 42,740 out of 43,400 workers at the Republic Company. Neutral sources estimate that a total of about 60,000 to 70,000 workers at the factories of the three companies are on strike or have stopped working due to the strike. Federal government mediator Dewey has now begun to operate, but a labor-management mediation meeting will not be convened until next week. (National News Agency, 28th)

London Correspondence

### Coronation of King George VI of England

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Zheng Nanwei

On May 12, 1937, the King was crowned at Westminster Abbey. From that day forward, he became "George VI, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India." The coronation ceremony was grand and magnificent, transforming London into a dazzling capital, a city of joy and celebration for the masses. The night before the coronation, before dusk, hundreds of thousands of people, carrying travel blankets and food, waited on both sides of the streets to watch the procession the next day. In Hyde Park, countless people, young and old, went to wait the afternoon before the coronation, camping joyfully on the grass. They did this so that they could see the procession pass by the next day. Recently, London has become a carnival city, the happiest capital in the world.

On the eve of the coronation, nearly two hundred buildings in London radiated colorful lights, which shone on the street decorations and lawns, creating a variety of beautiful colors. The famous Tower of London was also illuminated, creating a spectacle unseen in nine hundred years. Furthermore, twelve mail ships, including the Queen Mary, used full power to rush more than five thousand people from the United States to London within forty-eight hours before the coronation to see this grand ceremony.

In the past few days, the bustling streets of West London have been unbearably crowded, with a continuous stream of people filling the six miles of streets through which the coronation procession would pass, gazing with astonishment at the decorations—the amazing beauty of Pall Mall, the medieval grandeur around Westminster Abbey, the brilliance of Whitehall, and the glory of Regent Street and Oxford Street.

When King George and Queen Elizabeth rode in the carriage, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, from Buckingham Palace straight to Westminster Abbey, the frenzy in London reached its peak, and cheers thundered along the route.

Ahead of the royal carriage were those attending the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, such as the Lord Mayor of London and the Speaker of the House of Commons. At 8:55 AM, a procession of cars arrived, which included some members of the royal family and envoys from various countries. Dr. Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy sent by the Chinese National Government, and Minister Chen Shaokuan, etc., were at the front of this procession. Following was a procession of carriages, carrying the prime ministers and ministers of India and Burma, as well as leaders from other colonies. At 10:15 AM, another procession of carriages with royal relatives arrived, followed by Queen Mother Mary.

As the royal carriage prepared to depart from the upper gardens of Buckingham Palace, the guards, riding on tall horses, were solemn and magnificent.

At 11:00 AM, the coronation ceremony began.

From the first Norman King of England to the last King George VI, without exception, all English Kings have been crowned in Westminster Abbey. Although royal families have changed throughout history, emperors from the Norman, Plantagenet, Lancaster, York, Tudor, Stuart, Hanoverian, and the current Windsor families have all performed the grand ceremony in the same temple, regardless of dynasty or person.

During the ceremony, although there was thunderous cheering outside, the air in the temple was extremely solemn and quiet due to the religious rituals. At this time, even though the King and Queen were accustomed to pomp and composure, they could not help but be moved by this solemn ceremony.

After the national anthem was sung and the new King was recognized, the Archbishop of Canterbury stood up in front of the King and asked him questions, such as whether he was willing to serve the people and be loyal to the country, etc. The new King answered affirmatively to each question. The new King rose from his throne, walked to the altar, took off his hat, knelt on the steps, placed his right hand on the Bible, swore an oath, and signed the oath.

After the Holy Communion service, the new King still walked to the altar and sat on King Edward's chair. The Archbishop applied the sacred oil in the shape of a cross on the new King's left and right palms, chest, and crown. Then the Archbishop handed the national sword to the new King's right hand, as well as the royal robe, orb, ring, scepter, dove scepter, and Bible. At this time, the Archbishop took the Crown of St. Edward from the Sub-Dean of Westminster and placed it on the new King's head. Thereupon the citizens cheered loudly, "God save the King!" All the other nobles also put on their crowns, trumpets sounded, followed by drums, the Tower of London cannons, and the Hyde Park batteries, all fired.

The new King walked to the platform, and the Archbishop knelt before him, declaring his own and other nobles' loyalty to the new King. The Archbishop finally kissed the new King's left cheek and withdrew.

Next, the Duke of Gloucester walked to the steps of the throne, also knelt in front of the King, and placed his hand in the new King's hand to show submission. Then the Duke of Kent also knelt down in the same way and declared his submission to the new King. Later, the other nobles did the same.

After the declaration of submission, the choir sang the national anthem, drums were beaten, and the people cheered.

"God save the King,

Long live King George,

Long live forever."

Then the Archbishop and Bishop performed the anointing and coronation ceremony for the Queen. Unlike the new King, she could not sit down; she had to kneel down to receive her crown. The holy oil was only applied to her head, not elsewhere; she had no orb or royal robe. The Archbishop handed the scepter to the Queen's right hand and the staff with a holy dove to her left hand. Afterwards, she stood up to salute the new King, then went to the altar to be seated. The new King and Queen sat side by side, wearing crowns on their heads and holding scepters in their hands, and thus the coronation ceremony was completed.

Only seven thousand seven hundred people were able to enjoy the spectacle of the coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey, but the number of people who saw the grand procession to and from Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, including more than one million people from overseas, was at least four or five million. They all clearly heard the new King's oath and the progress of the ceremony, because thanks to the broadcast, the British Broadcasting Corporation described every move of this grand ceremony, which left a great record in history, to the crowds filling the streets and alleys. At the same time, those not in London, people all over the world, could hear it while sitting in front of their radios at home.

The new King, wearing a purple velvet royal robe, a crown on his head, holding an orb in his left hand and a scepter in his right hand, walked out of the ancient temple with the Queen to receive the celebration of the people.

When the new King and Queen walked out of the royal carriage, onto the street filled with flags and dazzling lights, and then into Westminster Abbey, until they performed the grand ceremony and came out of the temple, they had been on their way for three hours and forty-five minutes. During these three hours and forty-five minutes, thousands of people waited with joy and patience on streets where every inch of ground was precious. Among them, many people fainted or were injured due to crowding or exhaustion. The hospitals set up along the way treated at least eight thousand people in the ten hours before the coronation.

At 2:15 PM, the return procession began, with all the guards being cavalry, including two regiments of guards and the Royal Horse Guards. On the avenue in front of the palace, infantrymen in red military uniforms and tall black bearskin hats lined up to greet them. The soldiers participating in this procession were unprecedented in their impressive physique, beautiful uniforms, orderly steps, and tall horses. Its magnificence and dignity were rare in the world. It was a true blessing to witness this scene.

### Soviet Russian Arctic Explorers Can Listen to Radio Concerts

[Moscow] The All-Soviet Radio Committee will hold a radio concert in May (20th) specifically for the explorers living on Arctic ice floes. The participants will be Moscow's best artists. A report from the Arctic station stated that the number of residents in the Soviet Arctic camp is rapidly increasing. Since the arrival of Alexeyev's plane on May 27, there have been twenty-nine people. The station is now actively working. The wind-powered generator has been installed and can generate electricity even in a light breeze. The first current generated has been injected into storage batteries. The radio station has been moved into a large room made of ice, with a separate small room for the oil-powered generator for equipment. The entire team is unloading and sorting items for the winter, so that the four explorers who will stay here for a year can live safely. (TASS dispatch, 28th)

### Remnants of a Yunnan Journey (18)

— Bei Juan

Day 37 (May 11): Touring the streets of Guiyang, most of the goods come from Hunan, and the prices are almost twice as high as in Hunan and Hubei! Only Liu Yuanchun's bathhouse is relatively clean, while Dadong and Xin Shenghuo are slightly shabby. On this day, Mr. Yan Guofu, a member of the Disaster Investigation Committee of the Ministry of Finance, flew from Chongqing to Guizhou and immediately transferred to Qianxi and other areas to inspect. Mr. Du, the president of the Chongqing Daily, traveled with him. The two gentlemen did not hesitate to travel through the mountains and go deep into the disaster-stricken Guanling County to consult with the people, gaining a good understanding of the people's sentiments. When we passed by Qianxi, we saw the disaster. The lack of rain was the main reason, but generally farmers cultivate in terraces, cultivating layer by layer from the bottom of the hillside to the top. No matter what, the upper layer of land, even if the rainfall is abundant, still feels no irrigation. In the future, it seems appropriate to plant more drought-resistant crops, such as bells, wheat, corn, etc., and other grain plants suitable for dry land, in order to provide relief. In Qianxi's cultivated land, seven-tenths of the land has not been planted due to drought, and most of the seeds have been eaten, making it impossible to replant. Therefore, the disaster area is widening and the disaster is worsening. Although there has recently been sufficient rain, it is impossible to save the situation. The relief method should start with seeds and should not be perfunctory by simply distributing relief money and considering the matter finished. You must know that distributing relief money to allow disaster victims to eat their fill is only effective for six hours.

At noon, the provincial authorities gave a public banquet to colleagues at the People's Hall. Director Xue Boling and Chairman Gu, on behalf of Mr. Han Deqin, presented colleagues with local products such as "Maotai wine" and "Realgar essence." We ate and took some with us. The hosts were very affectionate. Colleagues then divided into two routes during the banquet (the northern route going to Sichuan and the southern route going to Guangxi at the same time). Colleagues on the northern route recommended Mr. Wei Tingsheng to deliver a speech, thanking Leader Chu and Chief Secretary Xue for their leadership and care along the way, and bidding a temporary farewell to colleagues on the southern route, with a unanimous toast. Among the colleagues on the southern route who were to give a speech, I am not good at rhetoric, and it was not my turn to speak. I strongly declined in public and asked Captain An Han to give a speech, which briefly stated that we came here and disturbed the local officials and all sectors of the counties we passed through, which Leader Chu had already apologized for. Colleagues have been on this long journey for the past thirty-six days. In addition to the fact that the Leader and Chief Secretary have joined the southern route, there is still leadership, which will not be mentioned for the time being. Now, to Deputy Leader Wu and Chief Secretary Zhou, who will soon be saying goodbye, we express our gratitude for their guidance along the way. Although the southern and northern routes are parting ways, they are following different paths to the same destination. At the beginning of next month, we should be able to reunite in the capital to deal with the preparation of reports and the review of photos. We are only temporarily separating." Then photos were taken and the event ended. We then attended a tea party hosted by Director Hu Jiazhao of the Construction Department, who reported on the general situation of the Sichuan-Guizhou highway project and the various construction projects planned for Guizhou Province in the future, all of which are still awaiting funding. According to people, the total length of highways in Guizhou Province is over 5,000 kilometers, but the monthly road maintenance fee is only about 9,000 yuan based on business income, which is too little. In the evening, the entire delegation gave a return banquet to the military and political leaders of Guizhou Province, which was very grand and lively. After the banquet, everyone returned to their residences to pack their luggage.

Day 38 (May 2): Departing from Guiyang in heavy rain, we on the southern route first traveled the Guizhou-Eastern Highway for half an hour. The heavy rain washed away the road, making it extremely bumpy. We arrived in Guiding at noon. After lunch, we set off, traveling through "Machangping" and "Ganbashao" and branching into the Guizhou-Southern Highway. The road was old but wide and firm, but it lacked proper maintenance, so there were many ups and downs, making us feel like we were dancing in the car. On the way, we encountered 1,500 camels loaded with special local products from the previous month, returning from Hunan fully loaded with cloth and other goods. The mules and horses were frightened by the cars and gathered together, forcing us to stop whenever we encountered them. We arrived in Duyun County in the afternoon. The mountains and rivers were beautiful, and the literary style was extremely prosperous. More than a thousand male and female students lined up to welcome us, with rosy complexions, completely different from Guizhou Central, Guizhou West, and Guizhou South. It is said that Duyun was where the Ming Confucian scholars Zhang Chong and Zou Jibiao lectured and taught one after another, and the legacy of their style and charm has its origins here. Leaving Duyun southward, the scenery along the way was quiet and beautiful, and the rural fields were well organized and very orderly. We arrived in Dushan County in the evening, when the lights were already on. The male and female students had been waiting to welcome us for five hours, which was a great pity. On our way, we passed through counties and often heard of male and female elementary school students standing in line and waiting for several hours. The local authorities only care about saving face for themselves and do not consider the cultivation of the youth, which is as unreasonable as conscripting laborers to repair roads and hindering the people's lives and work.

That night, the Guangxi representatives, Mr. Liang, Mr. Wu, Mr. Liang, and Mr. Ao, arrived in Dushan and sent two long-distance vehicles. It was heard that the Guangxi road drivers were mostly from Guangdong. Commissioner Wang of Dushan County, who spoke with an Anhui Huoqiu accent, said that the county has a population of 150,000. The county seat is located at the foot of Mount Wu in the Miaoling Mountains. Three miles outside the city, there is a cave that leads directly to the bottom of the city. It is said that the city is entirely composed of underground caves. Forty kilometers from the city, there is a hot spring. When Shi Dakai entered from northern Guangxi, he first occupied the Mass Grave of Ten Thousand People south of Dushan City, which is a relic from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The territory has many caves, including large caves that can hold ten thousand people.

The mileage calculation of the Guizhou-Southern Highway that we traveled south from Ganbashao is not accurate, and there are no mileage markers. There are also few place name signs in the villages and towns along the way, and there are no regular highway buses. Those that exist are business vehicles hired for special trips. Therefore, although the road has good innate conditions, it lacks coordination in its development.

Day 39 (May 13): When leaving Dushan in the morning, all sectors held a welcome meeting. Commissioner Wang delivered a speech hoping that the central government would provide funding and talent to help the people of southern Guizhou with production. We set off at nine o'clock and saw a very large slogan on the city wall in the area of the South Gate of Dushan, "Demand that the Central Government Immediately Abolish All Unequal Treaties Between China and Japan," which seemed to be something from half a year ago. At eleven o'clock, we passed through Shangsi Town, Xiasi Town, and Nanzhai and arrived at the junction of Guizhou and Guangxi. There, "Turtle Mountain is a strange peak that rises abruptly, its head facing the road, appearing to guide the traffic of Guizhou and Guangxi. Next to the mountain, a group of mountains embrace a peak, and there is a large round hole in the waist of the peak. Both sides can see the sky. It is commonly called 'Beauty Looking in the Mirror'. How about changing the name to 'Stars Surrounding the Moon'? It's more appropriate."

Three miles into Guangxi, we arrived at Liuzhai. Mr. Wei Yongcheng, the director of the Political Training Office of the Guangxi Headquarters, came to guide us to the Liuzhai Town station. The station was very solemn and luxurious, with three stories. Colleagues lived in separate rooms. Mr. Wei graduated from Moscow University in the Soviet Union. For the past three years, he has also studied in Germany and has only recently returned. Deputy Commander Bai Jiansheng has long admired his talent, so he entrusted him with the column on political training and also appointed him as the head of the Guangxi Daily. As soon as we entered the territory, the highway was flat and straight, and tung trees were planted on both sides, with green leaves providing shade and branches full of seeds. Even the small roads leading to the villages were paved with sand and embankments, showing a glimpse of the village organization. At this time, some conscripts were being demobilized. They took photos at the station, and this photo served as their certificate of completion of service. The town has a central school (i.e., a senior elementary school class), "three-in-one"—the town head兼team leader (the village veteran team leader) and the school principal is the "government," "military," and "school" leader. Each village nearby has a primary school (junior class), where the "village head兼school" principal and the "regiment" team leader. Every village in the province is like this. The school curriculum does not follow the Ministry's system, but is compiled by the province. The agricultural equipment in the village is very simple, and the farmers' lives are very hard, with very weak purchasing power. However, men, women, old, and young, everywhere, demonstrate the word "diligence." Liuzhai Park and the nearby highways were built by Division Commander Mo Shujie and his troops. Mr. Mo is a local and donated his salary to help road construction, so the townspeople praised him endlessly. Director Liang of the Highway Bureau is from Guangdong. The station platforms and car fields are clean and tidy, and the residents along the road have developed a natural obligation to repair and maintain the roads and do not tolerate coercion. Therefore, the entire road is flat and easy to travel.

### Tianjin Customs Completes Anti-Smuggling Barrier

Treacherous Merchants Open Up Alternative Smuggling Routes; Disguises for Stealthy Transportation Are Extremely Cunning; Rōnin Deeply Penetrate the Interior to Cause Disturbances

Tianjin Correspondence: In an environment of extreme difficulty, the Tianjin Customs has never relaxed its anti-smuggling work. The establishment of inspection posts in the suburbs of Tianjin, such as Baimiao, Dayao, Xiaoximen, Dawangzhuang, Balitai, and Xiaowangzhuang Hanqiao, has been quite effective. Although the armed smuggling of large gangs of certain country's rōnin who force their way through checkpoints still occurs constantly, several cases of sporadic smuggling are detected every day. This gives small merchants a blow, making them afraid to profit illegally, and its effect may be better than large-scale seizures. As for the interior of Hebei Province, such as Baoding and Xingtai on the Pinghan Railway, and Jinghai, Cangxian, and Bozhen on the Jinpu Railway, inspection posts have also been established one after another. According to the Tianjin Customs authorities, all anti-smuggling work is set up like three lines of defense. No matter if rōnin smuggle goods from "Eastern Hebei" via the Beining Railway or by waterway, even if they can escape the station to enter a certain country's concession, they will be seized by the Tianjin suburban inspection post when they leave the city. This is the first line of defense. Assuming that rōnin escape the first line of defense by extremely vile and shameful means, those transporting goods via the Pinghan Railway have Baoding and Xingtai inspection posts, and those transporting goods via the Jinpu Railway have Cangxian and Bozhen inspection posts, which will be difficult to escape. This is the second connected line of defense. The third line of defense is the prevention and control between provinces in North China. This matter is being properly considered by the customs and the General Office for Preventing Land Transportation Smuggling Inspection because the scope is large. What deserves attention and has the most impact on anti-smuggling work, two points have been recently discovered: ① Certain country's rōnin gather dozens or even hundreds of people, each holding wooden sticks, iron rulers, or other weapons, to forcibly seize smuggled goods in the form of a fight. On the 22nd of this month, such an event occurred at the Tianjin East Railway Station. This is extremely common in Tianjin, where rōnin run rampant. When unarmed customs officers encounter them, they feel helpless. ② Small-scale smugglers use extremely ingenious methods to disguise their smuggling, making it impossible for customs officers to guard against. Recently, the Xiaoxiguan inspection post has seized several disguised smugglers. Some put undeclared hemp silk into an emergency vehicle. The vehicle is white and painted with a red cross, like a hospital's sanitary treatment vehicle. Others sew smuggled broadcloth into postal parcels, with a person wearing green clothes, a green hat, and riding a green bicycle, transporting them out of the country, like a post office messenger. Still others use wedding sedan boxes, snack boxes, and fresh food baskets to transport smuggled goods, using every possible means and cunning scheme. The customs is extremely thoughtful in order to prevent this.

When treacherous merchants are caught purchasing smuggled goods, they often lose their fortunes and go bankrupt, unable to continue purchasing smuggled goods. Therefore, certain country's smuggling merchants suffer a very significant indirect blow. Recently, they have changed to using rōnin as bodyguards until the smuggled goods are sold out. However, as a result, incidents of rōnin causing disturbances have penetrated into various counties in the interior of Hebei Province. A few days ago, rōnin escorted two hundred bags of smuggled sugar from the South Canal to Bozhen for sale. When the boat traveled to Qingxian, 160 miles from Tianjin, it was seized and detained by the local police局. The rōnin escorting the smuggled sugar immediately telegraphed Tianjin. In a moment, eighty rōnin, riding in two large cars, rushed to Qingxian. In addition to carrying sharp knives and iron rulers, some were armed with guns. They provoked trouble with the police局. Fortunately, the local security regiment was well prepared, and the rōnin were ultimately unsuccessful. As a result, they were fined 200 yuan and ordered to pay supplementary taxes at the Tianjin Customs Bozhen inspection post before being released. Similar incidents are numerous. According to another source, the Tianjin Customs has recently stepped up its anti-smuggling work and has generally established inspection posts in the urban area, suburbs, and interior of Hebei Province, completing the final anti-smuggling barrier. Smuggled goods are extremely difficult to transport out of Tianjin, so smuggled goods are now piled up like mountains in certain concessions. General smuggling merchants are still struggling and have changed their transportation routes. Various smuggled goods are transported via Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao, and other places to Beijing via the Beining Railway, without being unloaded in Tianjin to avoid customs inspection. However, the customs has also notified the Customs Office in Beijing to be responsible for interception. (27th)

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Plans to Build Five Major Factories

Textile and Woolen Factories to Be Established in Xiaoshan; Sawmill to Be Established in Hangzhou in Partnership with Ministry; Cement and Rayon Factories to Be Established in Changfu

Hangzhou Correspondence: In order to develop industry, the Zhejiang Provincial Government is proceeding with plans to build various factories. Currently, it is first planning to build a spinning mill, with a fixed capital of six million yuan and a working capital of three million yuan, and is asking a syndicate to assist in investment. Director Wang Zheng of the Construction Department went to Shanghai a few days ago and is currently discussing methods and conditions. Once the contract is established, machinery can be purchased from the United Kingdom. The factory site is planned to be located in Xixing, Xiaoshan County.

## Page 10

The requisition of private land will require approximately four to five hundred acres. At the same time, a woolen mill is being planned in Xixing, with plans to purchase 150 locomotives. The factory will include dyeing and weaving departments, with an expenditure of 2.5 million yuan, half of which will be raised by Zhejiang Province and half of which will be invested by German merchants, with machinery serving as equity. Technical aspects will be handled by German experts. A draft contract for ordering machinery has been completed and will be signed soon. As for raw materials, Zhejiang Province's wool production is scarce. In addition to temporarily purchasing from North China and abroad, it is also encouraging sheep breeding in the sheep-producing areas around Jiaxing and Huzhou, with the goal of self-sufficiency in a few years. The provincial authorities are also encouraging merchants to establish industries in Zhejiang and have consulted with the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway bureaus to appropriately reduce the freight rates for the import of raw materials and the export of goods in order to support the development of production. In addition to planning the above two factories, the Zhejiang Provincial Government also plans to establish a cement factory in Changxing, and the Ministry of Railways previously sent personnel to investigate the wood-producing areas around Longyou and Suichang. The wood there can be used as railway ties. It is now planned to jointly establish a sawmill with the Zhejiang Provincial Government, with a fixed capital of 300,000 yuan. The factory site is planned to be located near Hangzhou City and is currently under negotiation. Shanghai merchants are also planning to establish a rayon factory in Fuyang, with an expenditure of 5 million yuan, which is also in progress.

### Treacherous Merchants in Shan County, Western Henan, Purchase Large Quantities of Scrap Copper

Shipped Out in Batches Over Several Months; A Total of More Than One Hundred Tons Has Been Shipped

Zhengzhou Correspondence: It was recently discovered in Shan County, western Henan, that a certain party sent people to purchase large quantities of scrap copper parts and transport them to Shanghai. It is now learned that Bamaqiao and Yaocun in Shaanxi Province have recently transported such copper to Shanghai and Peiping in small batches. Most of it is unloaded at the Shanghai North Railway Station. According to an investigation, Bamaqiao and Yaocun stations have shipped out approximately one hundred tons of scrap copper in batches over the past few months. It is said that according to the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, if the weight of the scrap copper to be shipped exceeds one thousand kilograms, a permit must be obtained from the Ministry. However, the scrap copper shipped to Shanghai by treacherous merchants is always less than one thousand kilograms. Each day, the amount of goods delivered for shipment is less than one thousand kilograms, but if the weight of several shipments is combined, it often exceeds the limit. Therefore, the export of scrap copper is obviously a deliberate scheme by general treacherous merchants to avoid the procedures for obtaining a permit from the Ministry of Railways. The Railway Bureau is limited by the Ministry's regulations, and since the weight does not exceed one thousand kilograms, it is unable to stop it. (May 20th)

### Superstition Surrounding the Plague in Southern Fujian

Boring and Extremely Thoughtless Year-Changing Rituals to Ward Off the Plague; Also, Huge Sums of Money Are Spent on Offering Sacrifices to the Gods

Fuzhou Dispatch: The plague is spreading fiercely in various counties of southern Fujian. People are unable to suppress it, so they flock to worship gods and pray for protection. The people of Putian County earnestly invited the Tian Yuan Shuai (Marshal Tian) of the Fourth Western District to descend into a medium. Through the medium, instructions were given, saying that this year is the year of the plague and that the plague will continue to spread in various villages for several months before it can be stopped. When the local villagers heard this, they were greatly alarmed. The village elders convened meetings and planned to invite Marshal Tian to hold rituals outside the city to ward off the plague. The medium inquired with the god, who said that holding rituals outside the city would cost the villagers a lot of money and should not be done. However, since this year has been designated as the year of the plague, the year should be changed quickly. That is, the thirtieth day of the fourth month of the old lunar calendar should be changed to New Year's Eve. Each village must paste peach wood charms, set off firecrackers, and prepare items to celebrate the New Year. The first day of the fifth month of the old lunar calendar is "Wu Dan" (a day of no beginning), which should be treated as a new year, with sacrifices to heaven and ancestors. In mid-month, the Lantern Festival should be held as usual in each village, with offerings to the gods in accordance with the rites. If all these are done, the plague in each village can be eliminated. The villagers thought that this would not cost too much money, so they decided to paste peach wood charms and celebrate New Year's Eve on the thirtieth day of the fourth month of the old lunar calendar. The first day of the fifth month of the old lunar calendar will be New Year's Day, with shops closing and firecrackers being set off. In mid-month, the Lantern Festival will be celebrated, and exorcism rituals will be performed to offer sacrifices to the gods. It is said that a major plague occurred in the vicinity of this area in the twelfth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. More than 100 people died in the village of Dongwan. The villagers also changed the year and warded off the plague in this way. Furthermore, in Wuli Town, Yongchun County, the plague has been spreading recently. Those who are superstitious believe that it is caused by the plague spirit and have initiated the construction of an altar to perform religious ceremonies to drive away the plague demon. They invited Taoist priests to worship Buddha and burn incense in the Huayan Chamber for three days. Upon investigation, it was found that there were many small stalls on the Wuli Town market, with swarms of flies, which was extremely unhygienic. Garbage was piled up behind the shops, and no one swept it away. The stench was unbearable after being exposed to the sun and rain. This is the source of the plague. If these meaningless expenses were used for sanitation facilities and garbage removal, it would be more effective than performing a grand religious ceremony for thirty days. As for the panic in the plague-stricken areas of Huian County, it goes without saying. Even villages that have not yet been invaded are in imminent danger. Because of the impending disaster, foolish villagers are praying to gods to ward off the disaster, and all kinds of superstitious activities are prevalent. Recently, in Jiadun Temple in the eastern district of the county, there is a strange monk whose origin is unknown. He is spreading heretical ideas and confusing people, saying that they must quickly hold religious festivals to eliminate disasters and resolve difficulties. Otherwise, the plague god will soon land, and a severe plague will inevitably occur. After this propaganda, Changming Township, Shangting Township, and Zhengcuo Township took the lead in advocating a pilgrimage to the Mazu Temple on Meizhou Island. Subsequently, the news spread, and ignorant men and women from Changtou, Duantou, Dongtou, Changting, Kenghuang, Zhengcuo, and Xicai Townships all agreed to hire a boat to Meizhou Island in Putian County on the twenty-fifth day of the fourth month of the old lunar calendar to make a pilgrimage and return to their villages at the beginning of next month. The people of each township are now focused on decorating floats, dressing up, and renting more than a hundred sturdy horses to serve as divine horses in preparation for welcoming the pilgrims when they return on that day. Each township is also apportioning funds to perform operas and offer sacrifices to the gods at the Jiadun Temple on that day, as well as to arrange banquets to reward the divine soldiers and generals. The expenses will be in the tens of thousands, which is truly senseless.

Demanding Grain Taxes Almost Leads to Unrest

Because the people of this county owe a large amount of grain taxes, the county committee specially dispatched police officers to the countryside to collect the taxes. The day before yesterday, in Zhouzhuang, the detention of a concubine of a grain household, Zhao Zongtian's younger brother, almost caused an uproar. Then they went to Jiang Huanrong's house in Dujia Lane to demand taxes, and a misunderstanding occurred.

Department of Finance Advocates Rural Savings

Since the Department of Finance promoted township banks in this province last year, branch offices of the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank have been established in various counties north and south of the Yangtze River, with as many as three or four in each county and at least one in each county. Financial circulation has a considerable foundation. However, because there are no proper savings institutions in rural areas, idle funds flow into the hands of usurers, fueling the flames of usury. In view of this, the Department is specially advocating township savings, so that rural idle funds can be properly used to help increase agricultural production.

Memorial Oration of the General Assembly

Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the May Thirtieth Cemetery, Vice Chairmen Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou, and Directors Cheng Xiechun, Zhu Yinjiang, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jiying, Zou Runqing, Zhao Jinqing, Gu Xinyi, Guo Shun, Yu Zuoting, Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, and Wang Han, respectfully offer pure water and fresh flowers to the spirits of the May Thirtieth Martyrs. Recalling that since the martyrs sacrificed their lives, they were followed by the Shakee Massacre, the Wanhsien Incident, the Northern Expedition, the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, the establishment of Shanghai as a city, the May Third Incident, the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, the breach of the Yellow River, the situation in eastern Chahar and northern Suiyuan, and up to now, twelve years have passed. Although the turmoil and potential changes are deeply painful, our Chinese nation has seen a glimmer of hope for survival amidst suffering. This is because our country has truly been unified, our country has Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as the sole leader, silver has been nationalized, and the legal tender is being implemented, showing signs of recovery in the economy. The anxieties in the southwest, and northwest have been alleviated, and politics are on the right track. Civic training and the rapid elimination of illiteracy are underway, and life is trending upward. Although lost territory has not been recovered and the revolution has not been completed, the vigorous development and growing national strength will prevent Germany from rearming in the Rhineland. This can be comforting to the martyrs. However, the world situation today is incomparable to the time when the martyrs sacrificed their lives. Military reduction has turned into military expansion. Germany forms one axis, and Britain and France form another, vying for dominance. A second world war is imminent. Neighboring Japan is trying to seize this opportunity to annex our country. The government's national policy is to resist if it cannot be avoided. The National Assembly will be held in due course, and the promulgation of a constitution is imminent. It is expected that our country, based on the Three Principles of the People, under the leadership of the leader, and with the unity of the entire nation, will surely place the nation on a rock-solid foundation and bring peace to the world. However, recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, although its Director-General does not want to see another May Thirtieth Massacre, has done everything possible to oppress the common people, forcibly demolishing shacks, leaving them homeless, and demolishing lofts, making it difficult for them to sleep and eat. On the other hand, it refuses to build civilian housing or support the livelihood of the common people, claiming that it has no power or ability to do so. Its motives are nothing more than to rekindle the spark of the May Thirtieth Massacre. We should do everything in our power to dissuade the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council from acting in this manner, so that no more martyrs follow in the footsteps of the May Thirtieth Martyrs. Alas, may you enjoy the offerings!

Flags at Half-Mast in Mourning

Today is the anniversary of the May Thirtieth Massacre. In addition to sending representatives to the May Thirtieth Cemetery at the end of Xibinxing Road, Zhabei, to pay tribute, all circles in the city will fly flags at half-mast and suspend entertainment and banquets for one day to mourn. The Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association also notified its member newspapers to take a day off.

High Alert in the Chinese Concession

The police authorities of the Chinese Concession, considering that the day is the anniversary of the Shanghai Nanjing Road Massacre, fearing that radical elements might take the opportunity to gather and parade, causing incidents, have implemented heightened security for the day. The Municipal Police Bureau has ordered all subordinate bureaus and detective teams to be fully mobilized for vigilance and to suppress any demonstrations. The police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have also implemented heightened security, it is said.

### Ministry of Communications Responds to Chamber of Commerce Regarding the Five-Minute System

Reasons for Not Restoring It

The Ministry of Communications responded to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's request to restore the five-minute system and change the extended time for express calls to be charged at the regular rate. The telegram yesterday read: "Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, your telegram in May has been received. According to reason, the telephone charges for civilian calls should be determined according to the duration of the call and the distance. The longer the call and the farther the distance, the higher the fee should be. Therefore, the fee for the five-minute system should be more expensive than the three-minute system. Currently, in order to reduce the basic call fee and lighten the burden on users, countries around the world have changed from the five-minute system to the three-minute system. In the past, the scope of long-distance telephone calls in our country was small, so we still followed the old methods in various places and adopted the five-minute system and calculated according to the actual distance of the line. In recent years, this Ministry has actively planned to establish domestic and international long-distance telephones. In order to reduce the burden on users and to comply with international standards in preparation for communication with other countries, the three-minute system was implemented in the 24th year of the Republic and calculated according to spatial distance (spatial distance is shorter than line distance). The rates have been carefully reviewed and determined, so the current prices are mostly lower than before, and some have been reduced by more than half. For example, Shanghai to Nantong was originally 1.3 yuan, now only 60 cents, Yiguang to Zhenjiang was originally 1.15 yuan, now only 50 cents. It should not be regarded as increasing the rate. As for the extended time for express calls, the extended time is also charged at the express rate. According to the provisions of Section 2 of Article 30 of the Telephone Regulations attached to the International Telephone Convention, the charge for an express call is equal to one time the ordinary call fee for the same call time within the same charging period. Therefore, the calculation of long-distance express call fees in all countries is based on this provision. Whether it is the initial three minutes or any subsequent extension, it is calculated at twice the ordinary call fee. This is because express calls still enjoy the priority right of urgency during the extension of time after the three minutes of the call, and should still be charged at the express rate. Therefore, all countries do this, not just our country. In short, all facilities of this Ministry are aimed at facilitating the public, and everything that can reduce the burden on the public and increase the convenience of public use will be strived for within the possible scope. In recent years, the long-distance telephone business has improved a lot. For example, this Ministry, in view of the fact that the effect of calling someone or paging and extending the time is the same as calling a number, has stipulated that from the second time onwards, it will be charged at the number-calling price, which can be a clear proof. The request in your telegram to restore the five-minute system and change the extended time for express calls to the ordinary rate cannot be granted. Please be informed. Seal of the Ministry of Communications."

### Industrial Exhibition Expands Venue

Exhibition Spaces Are Free, Manufacturers Participate Enthusiastically, Resulting in Insufficient Space

Since the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tenth Anniversary of the Municipal Government of this city, the Industrial Exhibition held has received enthusiastic responses from applicants since the collection of exhibits began. It is reported that the Dalong Machinery Factory and others have specially designed and manufactured a complete set of the latest small textile machines to participate in this exhibition. All the components from spinning yarn to weaving cloth are complete, and they will be demonstrated in operation at the venue to attract the attention of all circles. Mei Ya Silk Factory, Chou Ya Iron Factory, and others will also completely demonstrate and display the silk weaving process at the venue. Other manufacturers such as China Electric Lamp Factory are also participating enthusiastically, resulting in the original construction of the venue being insufficient for allocation. In view of this, the Preparatory Committee for the Industrial Exhibition has drafted a plan to add a temporary venue, which will be submitted to the Preparatory Committee for the Tenth Anniversary of the Municipal Government for discussion, so that it can be rushed to build immediately. It is said that the reason why the venue is insufficient is that no fees are charged for the exhibition spaces, so the number of participating manufacturers has increased significantly.

### After the Launch of Spring Cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the First Batch of Zhejiang Cocoons Arrives in Shanghai

Cocoon Prices Skyrocket, a Rare Occurrence in a Decade. Silk Factories Prepare to Start Operations and Experiment with a Production-Based System.

Following the launch of spring cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Zhejiang Province experienced a poor harvest, leading to a surge in cocoon prices. The first batch of native Zhejiang cocoons has arrived in Shanghai, and silk factories are preparing to resume operations and experiment with a production-based wage system. Details are as follows:

Soaring Prices

Due to uneven rainfall, the spring cocoon harvest in Zhejiang Province was poor, particularly for native varieties. Competition among cocoon businesses due to the scarcity of goods has caused cocoon prices to skyrocket. Native varieties have risen to over 40 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), while improved varieties have risen to over 50 yuan per dan.

Due to the soaring prices, cocoon businesses would inevitably suffer losses if converted at the current overseas silk prices. Many are therefore willing to absorb the expenses and have ceased purchasing operations, a rare occurrence in the past decade.

New Cocoons Arrive in Shanghai

Cocoon businesses in Haining, Shaoxing, and other areas of Zhejiang Province that purchase native varieties have successively suspended operations. Businesses in Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other areas that purchase improved varieties began purchasing cocoons from the previous day. The first batch of spring cocoons of native varieties from Haining and other areas has been transported to Shanghai by train or civilian boats, but is stored in bank warehouses because the cocoon merchants borrowed money from banks or silk firms, so their goods must be stored in bank warehouses.

Silk Factories Begin Operations

In 1930, there were a total of 113 silk factories in Shanghai. Due to the decline of the silk industry, most of them successively ceased operations. Last year, only about 50 factories resumed operations. By January of this year, they were forced to shut down due to the depletion of raw materials. Now, with the launch of new cocoons, factories with remaining inventory are preparing to resume operations. However, worker wages are being converted to a production-based system.

### Haiyuan Was Towed Off Reef Yesterday

Immediately Going to Hong Kong for Repairs; Losses Awaiting Investigation

After the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan ship was grounded on a reef near the Jishui Gate lighthouse, the company requested the Hong Kong Taikoo Dockyard to send technicians and tugboats to be responsible for the rescue.

### Municipal Government's 10th Anniversary Special Issue Should Not Include Foreign Goods Advertisements

The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Goods, due to the request of its factory members, has requested that the "Shanghai Municipal Government Special Issue," which is being published for the Municipal Government's 10th anniversary exhibition, should contain as many advertisements for national goods as possible and should not promote foreign goods, in order to promote industrial progress. The association has resolved to notify all factory members to introduce and advertise in the special issue, and has sent a special letter to the Shanghai National Goods Movement Federation, the leader of the national goods groups, requesting the Municipal Government to uphold the principle of promoting national goods and not to accept foreign goods advertisements in order to enhance the status of the special issue. The original letter is recorded below: Sirs, We have learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government is preparing for the 10th anniversary celebrations, holding various exhibitions, and compiling "Shanghai Special Issue" to showcase the achievements of the construction of Greater Shanghai. They will be soliciting advertisements from manufacturers to promote the circulation of factory goods and make their achievements last for a long time. Our municipal government is promoting national goods everywhere, and our association applauds this wholeheartedly. Therefore, at the 22nd Executive Committee meeting yesterday, it was resolved to notify member factories to unanimously support and introduce advertisements in the special issue, so that the latest national industrial products can gain widespread recognition by the public and become popular, bringing glory to our national goods industry and enhancing the reputation of Shanghai. However, we hope that the publication will not contain advertisements for foreign goods, in order to show that it does not contradict the government's purpose of promoting national goods, and to avoid foreign merchants taking advantage of the enthusiasm of the Chinese people to use national goods. We humbly submit our views and seek correction from your esteemed association, the leader of national goods groups. If you are willing to sympathize with us, we humbly request that you forward the information to the Municipal Government, requesting that all advertisements in the "Shanghai Special Issue" should be limited to national goods, and that if there are requests to publish foreign goods advertisements, they should not be accepted, in order to honor the national system, and we will be fortunate to be able to fulfill our duties in serving national goods.

### The French Concession Public Works Bureau Announces This Year's Budget

### Smooth Negotiations in Various Places; National Match Joint Operations

The National Match Joint Operations Association is preparing to establish a South China branch. A month ago, Xu Zhiyi, a standing director of the head office, went to Guangzhou to negotiate and gained the support of manufacturers in the area. They have scheduled to send representatives to Shanghai within days to examine the organization and business operations of the head office and the Shanghai branch in order to prepare for the establishment of the branch in the province. According to the reporter's inquiry from the Joint Operations Association, the difficulties faced by the match industry in Guangdong Province are even greater than those in Central China. The existing factories are operating at only 40% capacity, but they still suffer from oversupply because the area is close to the tax-free ports of Hong Kong and Macau, and the dumping of foreign goods is very fierce. As a result, the sales of the factories' products are limited to Guangzhou City. Whether Guangxi Province will cooperate depends on the negotiations with the Guangdong manufacturers. Fujian Province only has one factory, which does not produce much, and the province's demand relies on the factories in Central China, so it is actually a member of the Shanghai branch. As for the uncooperative manufacturers in Qingdao, Liu Hongsheng, director of the head office, and directors Ueda and Xu Zhiyi went to mediate. It is said that a resolution is possible and negotiations are still underway.

In addition, of the remaining 9,500 rickshaws, 5,131 meet the standards for new-style vehicles.



### Li Guifang's Appeal Case's Court Order Still Requires Investigation

Accident Location Not a Designated Parking Area; Plaintiff Jumped and Fell, Injuring Himself

Xie Jinwen, a dockworker from Jiangbei employed by the Shanghai Postal General Bureau, along with about twenty fellow workers and postmen, boarded postal truck number three, driven by driver Li Guifang from Zengshan, at 6 PM on November 3rd of last year. The truck stopped at the Swire Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. The workers got off. When Xie jumped off last, the truck had already started moving, causing Xie to lose his balance, fall, and injure his left foot. His foot bone was fractured. After being sent to Guangci Hospital for a long period of treatment by the patrol房, he eventually recovered, but was left disabled and unable to earn a living. Xie then hired a lawyer to file a suit in the Criminal Division of the Special Second District Court against the driver Li Guifang and the Director of the Postal Administration, the Frenchman Zha Peilin (transliteration), for negligent injury, and attached a civil suit seeking 10,800 yuan in compensation for damages. After examining the details, as reported previously, the court sentenced Li Guifang to one month of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. The civil suit was transferred to the Civil Division. Li, dissatisfied with the judgment, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. Regarding the civil suit, Xie has now filed a separate lawsuit against Ji Guifang and Zha Peilin in the Civil Division of the Special Second District Court. On the 27th of this month, Judge Li Liang held a hearing and announced a postponement for further questioning. Yesterday, regarding the criminal appeal case, Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the Third Branch of the High Court, along with judges Chen and Wang, went to the Third Criminal Court for a hearing. The appellant Li Guifang, accompanied by his defense lawyer, appeared in court to state the reasons for his appeal, saying that the accident location was not a designated parking area and that he had not driven recklessly. The plaintiff jumped off the truck himself, resulting in the injury, and so on. The court also summoned the plaintiff Xie Jinwen and ordered him to remove the bandages on his injured foot for examination. After reviewing the case, the court, deeming that the case required further investigation, ordered a postponement for another hearing at a scheduled time.

### Wang Xingyao Discusses the Current Situation of the National Goods Joint Operations

Branch Offices Being Established in Various Locations

Since the China National Goods Joint Operations Co., Ltd. successfully raised the full amount of its first phase of stock offering and officially established its headquarters in Shanghai, it has been actively promoting the implementation of various planned projects. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency interviewed Mr. Wang Xingyao, the assistant manager of the company, yesterday to discuss the current situation of the company, as follows:

Establishing Branch Offices in Various Locations

Since the company officially announced its establishment, it has been in contact with the former China National Goods Joint Office. However, the two entities differ in nature, as the Joint Office is an organization without capital, while the Joint Operations Company is a joint-stock company. Currently, the more than ten national goods companies in various locations operated under the Joint Office are often experiencing a lack of funding or require improvements. Therefore, after being introduced to join the Joint Operations Company, they can receive practical assistance. At the same time, it is planned to establish branch offices in important cities such as Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanchang, Shantou, Guiyang, and Taiyuan in the short term.

Procedures for Establishing Branch Offices

The procedure for preparing for a branch office involves local industrial and commercial manufacturers initiating and requesting a significant shareholding organization from the Joint Operations Company, or the company directly sending personnel to prepare for a joint organization of national goods manufacturers. The Joint Operations Company joins in the joint operation of all share capital as needed, and publicly solicits investment. Investors are not limited to manufacturers; private individuals can also join. In the future, the Joint Operations Company can assist and provide services in various matters such as organization, management, and procurement for the branch offices.

Organizing a Banking Syndicate for Loans

Regarding the funding of branch offices, the Joint Operations Company has now agreed with various banks in Shanghai to form a national goods loan syndicate. In the future, based on the needs of branch offices or national goods industrial and commercial manufacturers in various locations, they can arrange loans through the introduction and guarantee of the Joint Operations Company to facilitate operations. The total amount will also be allocated based on the actual situation. The syndicate does not have a fixed amount. Detailed regulations are still being drafted. Therefore, the Shanghai Joint Operations Company office will be the general service agency for branch offices in various locations. It was recently reported that the company sent Chen Peng to Hankou to propose the establishment of a Hankou branch. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wang Xingyao, the manager of the company, yesterday to inquire about the details. It was said that the Hankou National Goods Company is indeed one of the companies that the Joint Operations Company plans to establish in the first phase, but as of now, no personnel have been sent there, and there is no one named Chen Peng in the company. Therefore, the news is inaccurate.

Various agencies and groups related to Dr. Niu during his lifetime will be invited to participate by the standing committee and Dr. Niu's family after discussion; (2) Xu Naili, Chen Wenyuan, Pang Jingzhou, Shi Siming, and Zhu Hengying will be elected as the five-member standing committee to be responsible for all preparations; (3) memorial methods: (a) publish the "Dr. Niu Huisheng Remembrance Book" in the name of the initiating groups.

### Korean Man Caught Transporting Drugs at North Station Yesterday Morning

Concealing Forty-Four Ounces of Morphine; Transferred to Japanese Police Station for Investigation

The Ping-Hu train arrived at Shanghai North Station at 7:50 AM yesterday morning. As passengers disembarked one after another, a police officer stationed at North Station from the North Station Police Sub-Bureau noticed a male passenger who looked panicked and rushed out. Suspecting something was amiss, the officer quickly stepped forward to stop him and ordered him to halt for inspection. As expected, the passenger's face turned pale and he trembled uncontrollably. The officers became more attentive, but found nothing on his body. They then searched his legs and found them to be very heavy. They ordered him to remove his socks and found that each sock and leg was wrapped with a cloth bag, each filled with morphine. They immediately apprehended the man and took him to the North Station Sub-Bureau. Upon weighing, the two bags of morphine totaled forty-four ounces. When questioned about his name, he claimed to be Cui Shida, age 27, of Korean nationality. He was evasive about other details. The Sub-Bureau reported the matter to the General Bureau and, after seeking instructions, notified the Japanese Consulate by telephone and dispatched officers to transfer the suspect to the Japanese Police Station for investigation.

### Western Book Reprints Industry Organizes Federation

Switching to Selling at Actual Prices Starting June 1st

In recent years, dozens of businesses engaged in the reprinting of Western books have sprung up and fallen in Shanghai. Many of them have sought to maintain smooth circulation due to capital shortages. Thus, some have appealed by offering high prices and low discounts, while others have cut corners, resulting in shoddy workmanship. Therefore, the unevenness of market prices and the inferiority of goods have reached an extreme. Recently, the Beiyang Printing Company, the first to invent the reprinting of Western books, initiated a federation of five printing companies, including Lianying, to organize the Western Book Reprinting Federation, unify prices, and switch to selling at actual prices in order to clear up the chaotic Western book reprinting industry and seek improvements in technology.

### Passing Through Changping

— Lan Pei

—— Northern Journey Notes

It was already ten o'clock when we were about to reach Changping County Station.

The sun in the early morning in the borderlands is somewhat scorching, and spring is no different.

On that plain where gazing makes one's eyes weary, wisps of hazy white dust rise from afar from time to time. Is it donkeys pulling carts or windlasses passing by, or is it the wind stirring up flying sand again? No one can say for sure.

Green leaves, have they not yet sprouted? The thin, straight white poplars stand forlorn in the wilderness, watching the sand and wind sweeping across the sky, unable to sigh even if they want to.

…We are all exhausted. The harsh climate and monotonous scenery of the borderlands make our eyelids feel heavier and heavier.

Sleepiness crawls into everyone's eyes.

…When a burst of noise awakens us, Changping has arrived.

We all cast searching glances, as if looking for something in this place that has fallen into special powers.

As expected, we indeed see a deformed and strange phenomenon.

Just like every third-class station, there is a short and crude station building. On one side of the station, a stone path winds, not knowing where it leads. Not far away, a densely layered roofline lies low against the blue sky. Opposite the station, there is an even simpler small white house with the black characters "Changping County Station" written on it. Besides a small open space with a standing frame next to the small house as a sports ground, there is the endless northern wilderness. …Under the scorching sun, this station seems particularly desolate. …There are only a few disembarking passengers. The station staff talk to each other lazily. The crows circling in the sky also lazily return to the bare branches. …Next to the station, several armed soldiers in yellow military caps and uniforms are dozing off with their guns. Occasionally, they cast a line of lost or weary eyes, common to us, the voyagers. On that small sports ground, several soldiers in gray civilian clothes are either leaning against the frame or squatting, silently contemplating something in the sun. Only the two road guards with guns on the station are still pacing back and forth with large strides, clutching the handles of their broadswords, adding the only vitality to this place.

"Those in yellow clothes who look like Japanese soldiers are the troops of the puppet government of Eastern Hebei," a travel companion who had been here before pointed out with experience. "Those in gray clothes are the Twenty-Ninth Army."

This makes us all feel a bit sad. Looking at a contrasting scene facing each other, I inevitably think of the withered yellow leaves hanging on the branches in the autumn wind. Oh, the fate of the old country!

"In Tongzhou, you can see even more ridiculous and painful phenomena!" The travel companion continued, "For example, when you arrive in Tongzhou, on one side of the city gate are the Twenty-Ninth Army with broadswords, and on the other side are the Eastern Hebei troops in yellow clothes..."

Hatefully gazing at the withered white poplars standing in the wilderness, we are all silent.

### Murky Stream

— Xu Ji

This life, carrying all sorts of people, goes on its endless journey, like a huge murky stream, carrying incredibly foul dregs and garbage, flowing, churning...

The longer he lives in the filth, the more he believes that his view is "correct." Some people are lewd, deceitful, base, and cruel. In the hearts of these people there is no sun—not even stars. It is always so dark and damp, like an underground prison, never seeing the light of day.

"And what do they live for?" This is something he can never understand. A young man, armed with an unarmed "conscience," bathing in the reality of this world, will feel like a pure lamb thrown into a pack of wolves, surrounded by water and fire. And in the murky stream of life, a person's inevitable fate is almost always "complete annihilation."

Thinking about it day and night, fearing it, in the end, he even dares not think about it anymore. A good and kind young person comes into society. In the young person's heart is the sun, but society is a dark ice cellar. When looking at society turns into "fear," the sun in the heart is also in cold, dark times. And in the end—in the end, one will also be drawn into the putrid side of life, becoming a member of the murky stream.

However, in fact, he has the sun of conscience, but he is also intimidated by the surrounding "tigers and wolves"—he also fears.

How do people live?—He seems to have read a terrible prose poem, had a nightmare...

People float in the world, like mosquito larvae living in sewage. Every day they make grimaces, glaring at each other; plotting, managing, deceiving, plundering, killing—they make ugly and hideous grimaces at the entire human race, covering the stars of the universe with a black veil.

However, those people, those "tigers and wolves," are not supreme demons. They themselves are also wearing fetters of mud, but they are unwilling to struggle out, and instead want to drag the entire world into a deeper mud pit, for the sake of that base "domination" and "exploitation"...

Of course, this terrible prose, this nightmare, is not over yet; but the sun that exists in the hearts of some people is gradually darkening, and a murky giant river appears on the hazy gray screen: dirty, rotten, carrying endless black dregs and impurities, rolling and flowing away.

One has to swim in these huge murky streams. The waves are so strong that it is even difficult for people to have that kind of tragic feeling, daring to think about dredging them. Aren't they all swallowed up in the dark waves?

And to deal with those passionate warriors, this "evil world" repeatedly responds with mockery and insidious sneers...

"But, only this kind of sun will not darken, right?" he thought, "Those dirty cruelties, the black veil outside the light of the universe, may one day be burned away."

Yes, but he does not hope that those ugly things will "rise and fall on their own." He, like all good voters, worships the sun and believes in the power of true humanity.

True humans have made a vow with the universe: they will dredge the murky stream of life, they will use the fiery flames of the sun of justice to burn away these dirty, greedy dregs.

The war between humanity and hell, the war between justice and filth, the war between a small boat and the turbid waves—these scenes should be great, just like dredging river channels during a flood, building iron bridges over giant rivers. The current stars are destined to die for the future sun.

However, he finally dared not think about these things, just as he dared not think about the filth of humanity: he stared at the murky stream of life with overly frightened eyes, and finally became speechless and dazed. He was frightened by the dirty dregs, and before the sun of humanity had revealed its warmth, the turbid stream of that tragic life had already submerged the top of his head.

This may just be a fairy tale.

### Zengzi's Filial Piety

— Dai Lai

Historical Sketch

"Ha...ha...ha..." Zengzi yawned weakly. He had been reading a little too much and was not used to the work in the fields. His father, Zeng Xi, was also loosening the soil clods in another field furrow. Hearing his son's yawn, he glanced sideways and spat, scolding:

"Lazy worm, the sun is so high, and you're still not awake."

Zengzi did not dare to make a sound, silently hoeing the field, one hoe at a time. It was spring season, and the cowherd was also strangely insensitive, singing love songs on the back of the ox, his eyes fixed on the little girl pounding clothes by the pond. Zengzi felt a surge of bitterness in his heart, but then he remembered the teacher's words, restraining the galloping of his ambitions. He yawned lazily again:

"Ha...ha...hu..." The hoe also unintentionally slipped from his palm, lying on the heavy soil. He wanted to pick it up, but his father had already seen it.

Zeng Xi rushed over from the muddy field and scolded, "You lazy worm, lazy worm..." The old man spoke with a stutter, unable to get the words out.

Zengzi knew he was in the wrong, his face flushed red. He picked up the hoe and swung it forcefully, but he was flustered and confused. The hoe hit a pile of melon roots, and the tender branches, unable to withstand the pressure, immediately broke into two pieces. Zengzi dared not make a sound, staring blankly, his dark eyes fixed on the corpse of the melon.

Zeng Xi was about to turn around, but he saw the trouble his son had caused. Although he was an old man, his temper was no less than that of a young man. While scolding, he swung the hoe handle in his hand. He thought that even though his child was a book fool, he would eventually run away this time. But Zengzi remained there, enduring the harsh blow. Moreover, his body was not strong, so he fell into the field, half of his body covered in mud.

Xi did not know that his son was no longer a farming brute. He thought that after reading books, he only knew how to play dead. He left on his own, still scolding as he went:

"Still playing dead, beast! Beast!" Although he was a little flustered in his heart, he kept turning back to look at his half-dead son in the muddy field.

After walking about fifty steps, Zengzi raised half of his body from the mud, clutching his chest. Zeng Xi thought he was definitely not dead, so he did not turn back and slipped home to smoke his pipe. With a bit of the father's severity, he also thought in his heart that the blow had been too harsh.

Zengzi stood up, like a blockhead, scratching his head for a while, and then remembered the sentence structure in the Book of Songs and the words of the old Master Kong. So he threw down the hoe and ran into his room, enduring the pain.

Zeng Xi was sitting in the hall. He did not expect him to come, but on the surface he was still stern, still natural. He was just about to teach him another lesson when Zengzi stood in front of him and spoke first:

"Dad, just now I offended you. You taught me a lesson with force, and you must have hurt your body?"

At that time, Zeng Xi was surprised. His eyes were blank, staring blankly at his son. He did not know whether he hated or resented him. Zengzi could not tell what it was, so he quietly retreated into his room.

As soon as he entered his room, he felt that it was not right. Standing was not right, sleeping was not right. He touched his waist, feeling a little sore. He took off his undershirt, revealing a strip of purplish-blue above his waist. Ignoring it, he picked up a zither from the wall, sat down, and began to play. He played some old tunes, but the rhythm was chaotic. He was thinking about his father, wondering if he was still all right and had not been seriously injured.

The matter spread quickly from Zeng Xi's mouth. Naturally, Zengzi's classmates also heard it from others and told their teacher. Master Kong's face did not look good after hearing the story, and he said in a rough voice:

"When Zeng Shen comes, don't let him come to see me."

"Yes, yes," the disciples replied, but each had their own thoughts, wondering what it was all about.

Zengzi's classmate told him the news. Zengzi scratched his messy hair, his eyes wide open, staring blankly at the white clouds. He was confused, as if he had had a nightmare, had bad luck in front of his father, and unexpectedly ran into a nose full of ashes from the old Master.

Like a piece of wood, he walked blankly towards the wilderness, wanting to explore the origin of the truth of filial piety. (See Confucius' Family Sayings)
