### Hebei to Hold Tax Conference Today

[Baoding] Hebei Province's Finance Department has previously drafted a three-year plan to rectify tax revenue throughout the province. In the first year, it has divided Qingyuan, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Xingjing, and Shulu into five tax collection districts, establishing bureaus for collection. The result has been an over-collection of nearly one million yuan. Now that the 26th year is about to begin, in order to promote the plan, it has been decided to add ten collection districts, including Cangxian, Dingxing, Anguo, Dingxian, Cixian, Nangong, Jiahe, Gaocheng, Rongcheng, and Jixian. Each district governs two or three counties. The candidates for bureau chiefs have been appointed. Director of the Department, Mai Yuzhang, will convene the new and old bureau chiefs, section chiefs of the department, and the secretary general in the provincial government auditorium on the 15th to hold a one-day tax conference.

### General Budget for Three Provinces and Cities

Passed by the Legislative Yuan

[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its 103rd meeting on the morning of the 14th, attended by 67 members including Ma Yinchu. Chairman Sun Ke passed four cases regarding the general budgets for ordinary revenue and expenditure of Jiangxi, Chahar, and Shanghai provinces and cities for the 25th year, and the additional general budget for ordinary revenue and expenditure of Jiangsu province for the 25th year, according to the results of the review by the Finance Committee. The revenue and expenditure of Jiangxi Province were each 26,625,295 yuan, the revenue and expenditure of Chahar Province were each 3,218,750 yuan, and the revenue and expenditure of Shanghai City were each 12,683,928 yuan. The 2 million yuan of debt in the revenue is tentatively approved to be listed, and actual expenditures should be reduced in the future to avoid borrowing to balance revenue and expenditure. The additional amount for Jiangsu Province is 5,148 yuan for both revenue and expenditure. In addition, the proposal by the Finance Committee that all local budgets should include disaster relief reserves in accordance with the law was passed. The original proposal of the Finance Committee stated that water and drought disasters occur frequently in various provinces in the north and south of China. The provinces of Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou have reported disasters one after another, and the people are displaced and in urgent need of relief. Article 1 of the Disaster Relief Reserve Law, which was discussed and resolved by the Legislative Yuan on October 4, 19th year, and promulgated by the government on the 18th of the same month, stipulates that the National Government should spend 1% of the total regular budget revenue each year as a central disaster relief reserve, but it can be stopped after accumulating 50 million yuan. Article 2 stipulates that the provincial government should spend 2% of the total regular budget revenue each year as a provincial disaster relief reserve. The provincial disaster relief reserve should be accumulated to 200,000 yuan per million population, and the previous budget expenditure can be stopped. Except for the central disaster relief reserve stipulated in Article 1, which has been listed as 2 million yuan in the expenditure classification table of the national budget for the 25th year, most local budgets have failed to list the disaster relief reserve item due to limited financial resources. Once a disaster occurs, it is necessary to raise funds before discussing disaster relief, which is often too late to be effective, and is not in line with the provisions of Article 2 of the Disaster Relief Reserve Law. Therefore, the committee unanimously decided that all local budgets should include disaster relief reserves in accordance with the law to prepare for emergencies. Whether there is constancy should be submitted for public decision. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Reasons for Revising the New Salt Law

[Nanjing] The Finance and Legal Committees of the Legislative Yuan are scheduled to hold a joint meeting next week to begin reviewing the revised New Salt Law. A reporter visited Chen Changheng, a member of the Legislative Yuan who originally drafted the New Salt Law, to inquire about the reasons for the revision. According to him, the New Salt Law has not been implemented since it was promulgated by the National Government in May of the 20th year. There are many reasons for this, and the large difference between the tax rate of the New Salt Law and the current tax rate is also one of the reasons why it cannot be implemented. The Ministry of Finance believes that the salt tax revenue, collected according to the current tax rate, has reached 200 million yuan. If the tax rate of the New Salt Law is adopted, the revenue will be reduced by more than 80 million yuan, which will inevitably affect the entire fiscal budget. Therefore, it strongly advocates increasing the original salt tax rate of 5 yuan per 100 kilograms in the New Salt Law to make it closer to the current tax rate, so as to adopt a radical policy to implement the New Salt Law. The Ministry of Finance intends to change the word "kilogram" in the tax rate of the New Salt Law to "market catty", and the tax rate remains the same. Although this method does not increase the tax on the surface, because one market catty is only half of one kilogram, it is actually equivalent to doubling the original tax rate of the New Salt Law. At the same time, the Salt Industry Group of the Central National Economic Planning Committee also drafted a five-year plan to implement the New Salt Law, so that the current tax rate will gradually decrease within five years to be close to the tax rate of the New Salt Law, and adopt a slow policy to implement the New Salt Law. After discussion by the Central Political Council, it was believed that the implementation of the New Salt Law should still adopt a radical policy, but the tax rate modification should not be entirely in accordance with the opinion of the Ministry of Finance to increase it drastically. Therefore, it is advocated that the salt tax should not exceed 5 yuan per 100 market catties at most. The tax rates in the national salt areas should be specified in another table, but no surcharges or additional taxes should be levied. The fishing salt tax should be changed to 2 jiao per 100 market catties. This method makes the salt tax rate flexible, which is closer to the current tax rate and avoids affecting the entire fiscal budget during implementation. Whether the revision is appropriate depends on the review of the Finance and Legal Committees of the Legislative Yuan. In addition, the original chapter on salt affairs agencies in the New Salt Law is inconsistent with the current organization of salt administration for improving the effectiveness of the system. During the discussion by the Central Political Council, many advocated deleting the chapter, and only stipulating the organization of salt affairs agencies in the supplementary provisions and determining it by law. Also, Article 37 of the original New Salt Law, regarding the establishment of the Salt Administration Reform Committee, also advocated deleting the table. All of the above two items, which should be amended incidentally, have also been sent to the Legislative Yuan by the Central Political Council for the Finance and Legal Committees to review together.

### Tianjin Authorities to Investigate Floating Corpses in Haihe River

The Municipal Government Has Drafted Three Measures. Japanese Authorities Extradite a Large Number of Morphine Addicts Again.

[Tianjin] The Tianjin Municipal Government, due to the incessant discovery of floating corpses, has ordered the Water and Land Police Bureau to set a deadline for formulating joint defense and apprehending criminals measures, and has dispatched detectives to be stationed in Dazhigu permanently, to ensure that the case comes to light as soon as possible. The Municipal Government has also closely liaised with the court, hoping that the case will be clarified early. According to court statistics, 99 floating corpses have been found since April 6. The examination results show that four people died with injuries, more than ten were white-faced addicts who died of addiction, and the rest were strong young men who died without injuries. Among them, eight out of ten died naked after death. Of all the floating corpses, only Ding Yuhe was claimed and buried by his family, and no one claimed the rest. (14th Special Dispatch)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Commentary on Reading the 1936 Business Report of Jin Cheng Bank

— Yi

The 1936 business report of Jin Cheng Bank is published continuously in this newspaper from today. The bank has been established for ten years and its position is worthy of being the center of the northern financial industry. Today, people from neighboring countries are eyeing our northern resources and domestic people deeply feel the urgent need to seek self-reliance in the economic sphere, so the expectations of the bank are very high. Moreover, the bank has the qualities of a commercial bank and a unique political vision. Its business goals are mostly in the construction of productive aspects, and it has spared no effort in assisting agriculture, industry, mining, and public utilities over the years. Whether viewed from the perspective of the national economy or from the perspective of national construction, the business operated by the bank cannot be ignored, therefore, we feel a deep interest in the bank's business report published this time. After browsing through it, I would like to briefly express my feelings.

First. Regarding the general economic situation. The report discusses the domestic and international economic situation in 1936, stating: "Our country was affected by the world economic recession about three years later than Europe and the United States, and its recovery was also later. The world economy began to decline in 1929 and gradually recovered in 1933, but in that year, our country's prices tended to be lower. It was not until this year that they improved... Although it is still difficult to predict how our country's recovery will evolve, it can be asserted that this year is a period of recovery." Our country's currency system was stable last year, prices rebounded, agricultural products had a bumper harvest, and construction made progress. The general economy, as the report says, has shown signs of recovery after a decline. However, we believe that this kind of superficial prosperity is not yet reliable, because our country's economic foundation has not yet been consolidated. Although the successful currency reform last year slightly improved the situation, the reverse surplus in foreign trade and the increase in the fiscal deficit are still undeniable flaws in our country's economy. These two are fundamental problems. Only after these two major problems are overcome can our country's economy embark on the path of true prosperity.

Second. Regarding construction and production businesses. In addition to general business in commercial finance, Jin Cheng Bank should also meet the needs of the times and strive to assist the development of construction and production businesses. This is commendable. According to the bank's report this year, in 1936, the bank's special services to society included joint small loan programs with local governments in Nanjing, Beiping, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Qingdao, and Lanxi for agriculture, industry, and commerce, and small industrial loans jointly run with the Academic Work Advisory Office. In terms of assisting the rural economy, there were Hebei cotton production improvement projects and agricultural cooperative loans in Hebei, Shaanxi, and Anhui. Under the heading of assisting transportation businesses, there were loans for the Nanping section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, loans for the Laoyao Port of the Longhai Railway, overdrafts secured by the Pinghan Railway of the Yuehan Railway, and investments in public chromium and shipping. All of these have obviously benefited the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is deeply hoped that the bank will continue to develop this construction spirit and pay more attention to the so-called special services.

Third. Regarding the financial system. The bank's report this year puts forward two points for enterprises to the government in the conclusion: one is the early implementation of the small central reserve bank plan, and the other is the establishment of a commercial bank's concurrent operation of agricultural and industrial financial system. The former is a prerequisite for establishing a sound financial system, and the latter can enable various important domestic industries to obtain more assistance from financial capital and make considerable progress. On the road to economic recovery in our country, the above two points are necessary steps. The government has recently been working hard to improve the financial system. Will it be able to live up to the bank's expectations in the near future?

### The British Imperial Conference Opened Yesterday at St. James's Palace in London

Foreign Affairs and National Defense Are the Main Topics South Ireland Sent No Representatives

[London] The British Imperial Conference officially opened at St. James's Palace at ten o'clock this morning. Representatives from all parts of the Empire participated except for the South Irish Free State. Prime Minister Baldwin was elected as chairman of the conference. The conference then passed a congratulatory message to the King and Queen, which was immediately sent to Buckingham Palace. The original text read, "The Prime Ministers and representatives of the various states of the British Empire, now gathered in London for deliberations, before beginning all other matters, respectfully convey to His Majesty the King and Her Majesty the Queen their enthusiastic support, hoping that the news that has just begun two days ago can be long-lasting and peaceful, and wishing that the people of the various states of the British Empire can forever enjoy its peace and harmony under the rule of the royal family, thanks to God's blessing." The most important items on the agenda of the first meeting of the Imperial Conference today are foreign affairs and national defense. Speakers include Baldwin, Australian Prime Minister Lyons, Canadian Prime Minister King, and other group leaders who also spoke in succession.

Baldwin's Speech

When Baldwin stood up to deliver his welcome speech, he said that careful discussions on diplomacy and national defense at this conference have become predetermined matters. Therefore, he hoped that the conference would carefully consider the long-term plan and find a way to resolve international affairs and the suspicions and competitions that divide the world. Other matters that need to be discussed incidentally include imperial relations issues related to the constitution and other technical matters, especially transportation issues.

Speeches by Representatives

Canadian Prime Minister King then stood up to speak. He expressed regret that South Ireland did not send representatives to participate, and hoped that the empire could benefit from South Ireland's participation in the future. King then said that India has now entered a new era of autonomy, and Canada sincerely wishes it success. King also expressed his delight that Southern Rhodesia and Burma sent envoys to attend as observers.

King further said that permanent peace must be achieved through economic stability. Therefore, the countries participating in the Imperial Conference this time have the responsibility to join hands with other countries willing to cooperate to gradually remove trade barriers. Australian Prime Minister Lyons then stood up to speak, saying that all autonomous regions, especially Australia, have a widespread interest in foreign policy, because in today's world, no country can survive in isolation. However, the new status of autonomous regions implies the responsibility of bearing the entire burden of the country. Therefore, all parties should do their best to share the responsibility for national defense. As far as Australia is concerned, the one with the most skin-deep interests is the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, Australia is very happy to see the establishment of a partial understanding of the Pacific Ocean or the signing of a non-aggression agreement between Pacific countries based on the spirit of the League of Nations. Lyons said that Australia is willing to cooperate with the people of the Pacific countries to promote the conclusion of this agreement in a spirit of understanding and sympathy.

South African Federal Prime Minister Hertzog then strongly stated the necessity of mutual cooperation in order to maximize the spirit of mutual assistance between states. As far as South Africa is concerned, the fate of its future is linked to the fate of Europe and the world and cannot be separated. Furthermore, South Africa greatly admires the British government's ability to overcome difficulties.

In addition, representatives from India, Burma, Southern Rhodesia, and New Zealand also made statements in succession. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 14th)

### British Imperial Conference to Discuss Plan to Establish Far East Fleet

[London] News Chronicle diplomatic correspondent Gaton recently claimed that the British Imperial Conference would discuss a plan to establish a Far East Imperial Fleet to protect the imperial sea lanes between Africa and the Pacific. The strength of this fleet would be equal to the imperial Mediterranean fleet, that is, 100 warships, including 15 battleships, two squadrons of cruisers, and three squadrons of destroyers. In addition to merging the existing fleets of the former autonomous territories, a huge sum of £70,000,000 will be allocated to build new ships. Its base should be established in Singapore, and the annual recurring expenses will total £12,000,000, of which 64% will be borne by the mother country and 36% will be shared by the autonomous territories. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 14th)

### Agenda

Can Be Divided Into Three Major Categories

[London] The British Imperial Conference is scheduled to open on the 15th, and there is something to be said about its progress and prospects. This conference was held in London and Ottawa in 1926 and 1932 respectively. The most important results were the determination of the equal status of the autonomous territories and the headquarters, and the regulation of preferential tariffs for imperial mutual trade. As for this year's Imperial Conference, it can be called the Imperial National Defense Conference. The prime ministers of the various autonomous territories and the British Prime Minister gathered in London to attend the coronation ceremony. The most important topics to be discussed are foreign policy and national defense, and these two issues are interrelated and inseparable. Although the outcome of the conference is difficult to predict, the various parts of the Empire will take this opportunity to further unite, organize the Imperial National Defense in accordance with the current actual situation, and protect their territorial integrity and jointly develop their culture and economy. This can be asserted. It is reported that this Imperial Conference was originally scheduled to be convened last year, but it was postponed due to the death of the late King George V in January last year. The conference was held in London during the coronation of the new king this year. As for the length of the conference, it has not been determined. It will probably last at least two weeks, and at most six weeks.

The topics listed on its agenda can be roughly divided into three categories: one is foreign affairs and national defense issues, the second is constitutional issues, and the third is commercial, shipping, aviation, and immigration issues. These are described separately as follows:

(1) Foreign Affairs and National Defense Issues

This type of issue will probably take up the largest part of the Imperial Conference's time, which can be divided into two items: one is general situation issues, and the other is various special issues that must be discussed. Although the autonomous territories and the headquarters have equal status, the center of the Imperial foreign policy has always been in London. This has been the case in the past two Imperial Conferences. There are two reasons for this: one is the reason of the constitution, and the other is the reason of a more practical nature. If one of the British headquarters and the autonomous territories becomes a belligerent group, the other parts of the Empire will inevitably be involved in the war vortex at the same time. However, the British headquarters is close to the center of the European war due to its location, and has special interests in the Near East and the Far East, and the British headquarters is responsible for most of the Imperial national defense and sea transportation. Therefore, if the British headquarters goes to war with other countries, the autonomous territories will be more easily involved in the war vortex. London has become the center of Imperial diplomacy, which is why. However, after the war, the tendency of the autonomous territories' foreign policy to be independent has become increasingly obvious. Some autonomous territories' prime ministers advocate the autonomy of the autonomous territories' foreign policy. Canada once put forward a claim that the British Imperial autonomous territories must be freely decided by the parliaments of each autonomous territory before they can join the war. The British headquarters has recently decided to delineate certain areas as the interest zone of the British Empire. If a war breaks out in these interest zones, the British headquarters' troops should intervene. In addition to the British autonomous territories and colonies, these interest zones extend to the eastern border of France and Belgium in Europe, and Iraq and Egypt in the Near East, which have special treaties with Britain to protect their territorial security. In addition, the British mandated territory of Palestine and the Suez Canal are also within it. Furthermore, the sea routes to the Far East countries and the Singapore naval base are also used as Britain's interest zones. Therefore, there is a problem: now, if a war crisis occurs in one of these interest zones, it is unlikely that the parliament of each autonomous territory will discuss it calmly and then join the war. Each autonomous territory must first decide how to intervene in such matters. This is what needs to be decided at this Imperial Conference.

If it is said that the autonomous territories will decide to refuse to intervene in such matters at this conference, it is incredible. Probably the parliament of each autonomous territory will declare in advance what kind of nature and what degree of assistance the autonomous territories are prepared to give to the mother country when the British interest zone is infringed. For example, whether the British Imperial parts should implement military or economic cooperation should be decided in advance, and it may also be possible to determine the responsibilities that each autonomous territory should bear due to the geographical location of the interest zone. In short, regarding the above-mentioned interest zones, this Imperial Conference will definitely resolve some difficulties and establish an open or secret defense agreement in principle. Even those who are not very optimistic deeply believe that this is possible.

In addition to this, there is another question: that is, outside the above-mentioned interest zones, if conflicts occur in various places in Europe such as Spain, Eastern Europe, or Southeastern Europe, and the British headquarters is involved in the war vortex, what attitude will the autonomous territories take? The Covenant of the League of Nations stipulates that when a member country is infringed, other member countries should provide assistance. Most of the British autonomous territories are member countries of the League of Nations, and can originally invoke the Covenant of the League of Nations to act together with Britain. However, the autonomous territories have always insisted that only the parliament of each autonomous territory has the right to decide to participate in the League of Nations and take joint measures against aggression. Therefore, the Covenant of the League of Nations is also difficult to generate an automatic effect. For this reason, the various parts of the British Empire and the mother country must also first conclude an agreement so that they can quickly coordinate actions in the event of such incidents. This is what the conference should decide.

If the above-mentioned general policy towards foreign countries is determined, the national defense issues can be entrusted to experts to resolve them. As for the principle of the division of tasks of Imperial national defense, it should be revised. However, the British Empire has always advocated that each autonomous territory should be responsible for its own defense, and the British headquarters is responsible for protecting the transportation routes related to the survival of the Empire. This principle will not be changed. There is a trend in London to ask the overseas autonomous territories to bear a part of the British headquarters' military expenses. Since the development of the aviation industry, the defense of the British Isles has become more difficult, and the Imperial transportation line in the Mediterranean is not as convenient as in the past. For this reason, the British headquarters' military expenditure is increasing day by day, and it must be borne by the autonomous territories to a certain extent. In recent months, the military preparations of the autonomous territories have greatly increased. Even Canada, whose geographical location is less harmful, is also competing to organize its army and armaments, especially in the air force. In the future, the British Imperial national defense organization should occupy its most important position with the air force. For several months, the British government has been negotiating with the autonomous territories to build aircraft fields in many places in the Empire to complete the aviation connection of various parts of the Empire. This negotiation may be established within days, and the final agreement is also unknown.

As for the naval aspect, the South African Federation signed an agreement with Britain in 1921 regarding the Simonstown naval base. After this agreement expired, it has recently been renewed. In addition, Singapore (continued on page 8)

### Qi Yano Clarifies Italian Foreign Policy

Seeking to Enhance Friendly Relations with China and Japan; Italian-German Cooperation Not Intended to Form a Bloc; Regrets Expressed Over Strained Anglo-Italian Relations

[Rome] Italian Foreign Minister Qi Yano, during a review of Italian foreign policy in the Chamber of Deputies today, hinted at the possibility of improving Anglo-Italian relations, stating that an unforeseen obstacle had delayed the progress of repairing relations. He added, "We are truly displeased to acknowledge this situation." Qi Yano denied that the cooperation between Italy and Germany constituted a bloc, asserting that it was based on a consensus on policies. He also stated that Italy was prepared to renew the Locarno Treaty, but it must adapt to the changed circumstances since 1935. Its primary objective should be to re-establish a system of security in Western Europe, accompanied by clearly defined and precise goals. Finally, the Foreign Minister expressed Italy's hope for better recognition of its work from the United States and urged Americans not to be misled by propaganda of dubious origin. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

[Rome] Italian Foreign Minister Qi Yano recently delivered a lengthy speech in the Chamber of Deputies, providing a detailed review of Italy's foreign policy. The final section touched upon Italy's relations with China and Japan, stating, "The relationship between China and Italy is extremely cordial. This is evidenced by Italy's repeated dispatch of naval, aviation, and financial experts to China.

As for Italy's relationship with Japan, it is characterized by mutual admiration. Japan's spontaneous recognition of the Italian Empire has enhanced the friendship between the peoples of Italy and Japan. Furthermore, Japan's firm stance against Bolshevism is another element of mutual understanding between Italy and Japan." The main points of Qi Yano's speech are summarized below:

Meaning of Italian-German Cooperation

Qi Yano began by stating, "Our cooperation with Germany should be implemented within the existing spirit. When I went to Germany, I only signed the Italian-German Protocol, and there is absolutely no need for any additions. Italy firmly opposes Europe being divided into mutually hostile blocs and has always maintained that Germany should be granted absolute equality. It is not uncommon for Italy and Germany to follow a common path. However, this does not create a bloc between the two countries. Italy and Germany are both authoritarian states, and their complete understanding is natural and an element of security and peace."

Qi Yano then expressed resentment that most countries were unwilling to immediately recognize the new Roman Empire, saying, "Most countries continue to not recognize the new Roman Empire, but that still cannot prevent our national flag from flying in the skies of our empire."

Attitude Towards the League of Nations

Regarding the League of Nations, he stated, "Italy is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude and is unwilling to propose any reforms to the League of Nations organization. However, the Fascist government will support any suggestions of such a nature."

On the Spanish Question

Regarding the Spanish question, Qi Yano solemnly stated, "Italy deeply doubts whether the surveillance plan for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War can be effective, but the commitment to non-intervention should still be strictly respected."

He also said, "Italy's friendship with Austria has never changed. However, those who hope that Italy's policy toward Austria will be anti-German should abandon such illusions."

Relations with Britain and France

Qi Yano then clarified relations between Britain and Italy, stating, "At the beginning of January this year, Britain and Italy concluded the Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement, which gave hope for peaceful cooperation between the two countries. Unfortunately, unexpected twists and turns have delayed the rapprochement between the two countries. However, it is absolutely incorrect to think that Italy has changed its attitude because of Britain's military expansion. Since the failure of the disarmament conference, we have demanded that our country have the right to rearm. Therefore, we would never deny any other country the right to strengthen its armaments."

Next, regarding relations with Czechoslovakia, Qi Yano said that Italy did not see the need to sign a new agreement with Czechoslovakia. "We do not believe that any disputes have arisen between Italy and Czechoslovakia, and there is currently nothing that makes us pay attention to the antagonism between the two countries."

Qi Yano went on to explain that Italy had decided that henceforth, all ambassadors and ministers presenting their credentials must use the title "King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia" on their credentials. This is a generally applicable measure and is not aimed at any particular country. In the past, when diplomatic representatives of some countries presented their credentials, Italy had allowed them to use the old title (i.e., only King of Italy and not Emperor of Abyssinia) because these diplomatic representatives had been appointed and approved by the Italian government before Italy conquered Abyssinia, so special accommodations were made.

Western European Pact Issue

Regarding the future Western European Pact, he stated that Italy was prepared to reassume the guarantee obligations under the old Locarno Treaty, provided that the new Locarno Pact retained its old structure. He also stated, "Italy will participate in any international conference that has been adequately prepared in advance."

In addition, Qi Yano expressed satisfaction with Italy's relations with the Balkan countries, especially with Yugoslavia, saying that although the political and economic treaties between Italy and Yugoslavia did not imply any intention against any other country, they were of great significance.

Expectations for the United States

In his conclusion, Qi Yano expressed sympathy for the dedication of American politicians to promoting world economic construction, saying that Italy would be happy to contribute to this economic construction. (Central News Agency, 13th, Havas)

### France Satisfied

[Paris] French political circles have commented on the speech delivered by Foreign Minister Qi Yano in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, saying that its tone was mild and compromising, especially the part concerning the United States and France. It is hoped that the prospects for the situation can be clarified. Right-wing figures here have not given up hope for a rapprochement between Italy and France and are particularly satisfied. However, left-wing figures refuse to express their opinions, fearing that the words of Foreign Minister Qi Yano may be a new strategy in Italian diplomacy. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

### German General Goering Passes Through Austria to Italy

Windows Tightly Closed; Mysterious Movements

[Vienna] German Aviation Minister General Goering recently arrived here from Berlin on a special train, planning to go to the Italian port of Venice, twenty-four hours earlier than scheduled. All the glass windows and blinds were closed. Most Germans here believe that Chancellor Hitler was on this special train, going to Italy in return, and they all wanted to see him. But General Goering said that the Chancellor was not on the train. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

[Paris] It is expected that German Chancellor Hitler and the Italian Prime Minister will soon hold talks in Berchtesgaden, Germany. Renowned reporter Shelbertina recently wrote an article in the Paris Echo commenting on this, stating briefly that the purpose of the Italian Prime Minister's visit was to obtain Hitler's unreserved assistance to contend with Britain and compete for hegemony in the Mediterranean. As for the Gentlemen's Agreement concluded between Britain and Italy at the beginning of January last year, it has now become a mere formality. "In the eyes of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Britain's military rearmament plan is directed against Italy. The repeated declarations recently issued by semi-official and official Italian circles on the Mediterranean issue indicate that Italy is determined to take concrete action before Britain fully restores its former hegemony in the Mediterranean, in order to take preemptive measures. In short, whether Mussolini wants to engage in bargaining in diplomacy and then intimidate, or take further action, he must rely on Germany's assistance. However, the recent talks between Italy and Austria-Hungary, although beneficial to Germany, Germany has not yet agreed to risk war to assist Italy, because Germany, for its own interests, is currently unwilling to take the risk of engaging in war. Regarding this matter, the Italian Prime Minister has repeatedly consulted with German Aviation Minister Goering and Foreign Minister Neurath, but no results have been achieved. It remains to be seen whether personal talks with Chancellor Hitler will be effective." (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

### Our Special Envoy Delegation

Completes Coronation Mission; Bids Farewell to the British King Today

[London] Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy of China participating in the coronation ceremony of the British King, and Chen Shaokuan, the deputy envoy, will go to Buckingham Palace tomorrow to bid farewell to the British King. Thus, the official duties of the Chinese delegation participating in the coronation ceremony will come to an end. At the same time, the financial experts who accompanied the delegation to Britain are now working diligently to draft a document on China's financial status, but it will not be completed within days. Rumors that China has made some suggestions should be ignored, as any specific suggestions must be estimated and discussed before being proposed. The Chinese delegation will stay in London for several days and attend banquets in many places. Tonight, British Foreign Secretary Eden will officially host a banquet for the two special envoys, Kong and Chen, and their entourage on Downing Street. Those accompanying the banquet include diplomats and British cabinet members. After the banquet, the two special envoys, Kong and Chen, will go to Buckingham Palace to attend the ball held by the British King and Queen. Deputy Envoy Chen will attend the naval review at Spithead at the invitation of the British Navy, but Special Envoy Kong is unlikely to go. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

[London] The British King and Queen held the second coronation banquet at Buckingham Palace tonight, with 450 guests attending. The King wore a gold and red admiral's uniform, and the Queen wore a red long dress, surrounded by ivory-colored lace, a diamond crown, and a diamond necklace. The King and Queen stood side by side and shook hands with the guests. Each guest was announced by the Master of Ceremonies. The Queen Mother, the Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent, and other members of the royal family were present. In addition, representatives from foreign countries and the British Empire who participated in the coronation were also present.

### British Destroyer Explodes on Spanish Seas Monitoring

Five Killed, Fourteen Injured; Investigation Pending on Whether Torpedo was Struck

⊙ Valencia The British destroyer "Hunter" (1,340 tons) was patrolling the coast of southern Spain today to fulfill its non-intervention responsibilities when a sudden explosion occurred on the side of the ship at the waterline, killing five people and injuring fourteen. According to news received by the British Embassy, the explosion originated outside the ship. The leader of the destroyer fleet, "Hardy" (1,455 tons), rushed from Gibraltar at full speed after receiving the message, heading to Almería, where it is reported to be transporting the victims. According to a report released by the Spanish Minister of the Navy from the captain of the Spanish government warship "Jaime I," the British ship "Hunter" was hit less than four miles from the port of Almería. The British ship is now being towed into the port of Almería by "Jaime I." The officers of "Jaime I" treated the British soldiers with courtesy. After receiving the report, he ordered the warship "Jaime I," the destroyer "Lazaga," and several armed fishing boats to rush to the rescue. After the explosion, the bow of the British ship sank. A Spanish small boat rescued fourteen sailors, but five people were trapped in the engine room and died. All that is known now is that the explosion of the British ship originated outside the ship. No further details have been received. The British destroyer "Hyperion" (1,340 tons) has arrived at the scene of the accident of the "Hunter." Rear Admiral Lyon, commander of the Third Cruiser Squadron, will arrive from Barcelona tomorrow morning on the cruiser "Arethusa." British and Spanish authorities will jointly inspect the hull of the "Hunter" today to determine the cause of the explosion. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

[London] The British Admiralty issued a bulletin today stating that eight people were killed and fourteen injured in the "Hunter" explosion. The cause is under investigation. (14th, National Telegraph)

[Paris] According to a telegram from a correspondent in Valencia from a French news agency, judging from the damage suffered by the British destroyer "Hunter," the explosion was not caused by hitting a mine. The ship's hull has traces of a projectile entering from one side and penetrating the other. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

[London] The news of the explosion on the "Hunter" in the southern waters of Spain has caused great shock here. However, because the initial news was very brief, official circles are very tight-lipped about the cause of the incident. Once the naval authorities receive a detailed report, it will be submitted to the cabinet for discussion. In short, the cause of this explosion was external. If necessary, the British government will take an extremely resolute attitude towards those responsible for the explosion. (Central News Agency, 13th, Havas)

### Danube Countries Notify Britain and France of Military Alliance Preparations in Berlin

In Exchange for Economic Aid; Italy and Germany Seek to Counteract

[Vienna] It was learned today that several Danube countries have notified Britain and France of their preparations to conclude a military alliance in exchange for economic aid. It is rumored that the future meeting between German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister is to counteract this matter. According to a diplomat, the United Press reported that the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria, and even Hungary are said to be prepared to abandon Germany and Italy, but Britain and France must provide the countries with export markets and establish a new foundation for European peace to guarantee prosperity as conditions of exchange. The Danube countries currently do not need loans, only trade. If there are those who can supply this need, they are willing to be their allies in politics and military. (14th, National Telegraph)

### Chinese Painting Exhibition Held in Berlin

Passed Second Reading in Parliament

⊙ Dublin The Parliament of the Southern Irish Free State passed the second reading of the new draft constitution today by a vote of 69 to 43. The head of the Southern Irish Free State administration, de Valera, claimed that the president's powers could currently be used for domestic affairs, but in the future, if people decide to abolish the law passed last December recognizing the British King's presidency over foreign affairs, then the president's powers can also be used for foreign affairs. This matter must be decided by the people outside the constitution. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

### Japanese Political and Civil Parties Strengthen Anti-Government Front

Government Hurries to Realize Military's Claims; Planning Bureau Formally Begins Work Yesterday

[Tokyo] The new secretaries-general of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties, Kojima Matajiro and Matsuno Tsuruhei, held their first meeting this afternoon, formally agreeing on a plan to strengthen and enrich the joint front of the two parties to overthrow the Hayashi cabinet. Afterwards, fellowship meetings and joint lectures will be held frequently until the current government is overthrown. The aim is to ensure that the two parties take absolutely consistent steps. At the same time, the five factions in the House of Peers that support constitutional government, namely the Kayokai, Koseikai, Doikai, Dowakai, and Koyū Club, have recently formed an alliance. As a result, the pressure on the Hayashi cabinet has increased. The current state of affairs indicates that the Hayashi cabinet has no hope of forming a new party, nor can it persuade or coerce the two major established parties, the Minseito and Seiyukai, to compromise. It is concentrating all its efforts on actively and faithfully implementing the military's demands, moving towards the so-called highly national defense, and attempting to extend the cabinet's life by increasing the military's support. The Planning Bureau formally began work today, and its mission is extremely important, no less than the highest comprehensive agency for promoting Japan's national political and economic activities on behalf of the military. It is rumored that the bureau's upcoming task is to re-examine the national defense economy and other bills that were not passed in the last parliament, and to draft the principles of the budget for the next fiscal year to meet the new needs of the army and navy. Both will be submitted at the special parliamentary session in August. The Planning Bureau will also be responsible for revising the current House of Representatives election law, with the main points being to reduce the number of electoral districts and parliamentary seats, and to thoroughly implement "designated election," attempting to fundamentally eliminate the superior position of established political parties in parliament. In addition, the Planning Bureau is actively preparing for the establishment of a permanent Central Economic Conference in Tokyo, composed of 15 representatives. One part of the representatives is made up of zaibatsu with close ties to the military, and the other part is made up of the Kwantung Army, the Korean Army, the Taiwanese Army, and others. The urgent task of the conference is to plan the so-called five-year plan for the unified national defense and industry of the Japanese Empire. At the same time, the establishment of the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Health (whose main purpose is to improve the physical fitness of conscripts), as well as the implementation of forced labor, are currently being actively promoted. The rumors that the military would not insist on supporting the Hayashi cabinet a few days ago have now subsided, because the Hayashi cabinet has shown extreme activity in completing its historical mission. This point is noteworthy. (Central News Agency, 14th)

### British Imperial Conference Agenda

(Continued from Page 7)

Naval bases, as transportation hubs for Australia and New Zealand, have been under construction for many years and will soon be completed. Canada, however, requires less naval power, but its navy is sufficient for local defense needs. Canada, located on the American continent, is rich in raw materials. Therefore, in the event of war, its role will often be to supply various crude and manufactured products to provide resources for other parts of the empire's war efforts. In military terms, Canada's role is less important than that of other autonomous dominions.

㊁ Constitutional Issues

This issue is of secondary importance compared to foreign affairs and national defense. The major points include: ㊀ Nationality issues; ㊁ The international status of each dominion; ㊂ Transportation issues between the dominions. The third item is the most important, as the empire's ability to make significant decisions in the event of an emergency depends on whether the various transportation bottlenecks have been resolved. The current system of exchanging opinions between the empire's territories is unlikely to undergo major reforms. At most, existing institutions will be improved and their administrative efficiency maximized. Conversely, the current conference may yield surprising results regarding the international status of the various territories. For example, Southern Rhodesia, whose status is already close to that of an autonomous dominion, may gain some new rights in the future, allowing it to join the ranks of autonomous states and compete with other countries in the world.

㊂ Commerce, Navigation, and Immigration Issues

Among these, the implementation details of the 1932 Ottawa Imperial Agreement will likely be resolved outside the Imperial Conference through bilateral talks between the United Kingdom and the dominions. The reciprocal preferential tariffs between different parts of the empire are unlikely to change significantly. However, Australia and New Zealand both want to expand their commodity markets outside the British Empire, especially in continental Europe. Therefore, the Ottawa Agreement may undergo slight revisions to allow for greater freedom in imperial international trade. The extent to which this can be achieved is of great interest. The working reports of the Imperial Economic Committee and other similar organizations will also be reviewed, but the general outline of current economic policies is unlikely to change. At most, the details of imperial economic policy will be adjusted by referring to the conclusions put forward by the committee. In addition, various issues related to navigation policies will also be discussed. In this regard, the Imperial Shipping Committee has investigated the state of British shipping in the Pacific Ocean and its impact from competition from American and Japanese shipping. This investigation report can be used for reference. Shipping issues are related to the survival of the empire and are closely linked to national defense and food supply issues. Therefore, the empire must do everything possible to maintain its maritime advantage and open new shipping routes to meet the empire's needs. In addition, the strategically important private aviation industry is also on the agenda of this Imperial Conference. Regarding this, the autonomous dominions have already been negotiating and agreeing on agreements to closely cooperate in the aviation industry. The current state of these negotiations is very satisfactory. Future efforts should focus on improving the existing civil aviation network to make it easier for airplanes to carry mail and passengers between different parts of the empire, while also supplementing the insufficient military aviation bases in various regions. Finally, there is the issue of mutual immigration between different parts of the empire. The United Kingdom is overpopulated, while the newly developed territories are sparsely populated. The management of population transfer from the UK to the territories has not been satisfactory. This issue is currently being discussed by experts, but it is too early to say that this conference will make important decisions. Immigration issues involve too much individual volition, and the government has limited policy options. (Havas News Agency, Thirteenth, Havana)

### Two Recent Events in Tianjin

— A True Account

A Station Employee Violently Assaulted by a Ronin; Speculation on the Truth of Floating Corpses in the Hai River

At 9:00 AM on the 12th, a Japanese man named Ogura Azuma went to the Tianjin East Station to buy a ticket to Beiping. He handed ticket clerk Chen Fengkai a 5-yuan banknote from the Hebei Provincial Bank, specifying that he wanted a second-class round-trip ticket on the Tianjin-Beiping sightseeing train. Chen, seeing that the fare was 6.8 yuan, told him that the money was insufficient. Ogura, however, glared and insisted that he had handed over a 10-yuan banknote and should receive 3.2 yuan in change after deducting the fare. As they couldn't understand each other's language, an argument ensued. Chen then called a colleague who spoke Japanese to explain, but Ogura was unreasonable and insisted that he had handed over a 10-yuan banknote. In the blink of an eye, Chen had somehow manipulated the bill into a 5-yuan note. Chen was so angered he turned pale and could not argue further. He then angrily led him into the ticket office, ordering him to examine the cash register to find the 10-yuan banknote from the Hebei Provincial Bank that he claimed to have given. After a long search, Ogura could not find it. Suddenly, he became enraged and grabbed Chen, punching and kicking him. The commotion threw the ticket office inside and out into complete chaos. The deputy trainmaster and stationmaster, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene to mediate, but to no avail. Ogura kept shouting "Baka!" and cursing at everyone. Unable to stop him, the trainmaster urgently reported to the railway bureau. After more than fifteen minutes, Inoue, a Japanese advisor from the railway bureau, arrived. The trainmaster and others hoped that this Japanese advisor would have enough authority to subdue the wild ronin. However, Ogura completely ignored him and continued to shout and assault Chen, leaving him with a bruised face and covered in blood. Finally, the advisor came up with a solution, notifying the Japanese military police stationed at the station to assist. Together, they managed to persuade Ogura to stop. At the suggestion of the Japanese military police, they decided to check the number of tickets sold and the amount of money received in the ticket office. If there was an excess of 5 yuan, it would undoubtedly mean that Chen had manipulated the money and cheated Ogura. At that time, regardless of what bill Ogura had handed over, Chen would be held responsible. Everyone present agreed to this method. Under the gaze of dozens of people, the Japanese military police began to check the ticket money. Most people were sweating for Chen, fearing that he might have been careless and had received 5 yuan too much. However, after checking again and again, the number of tickets sold and the amount of money received matched exactly, not even a penny off. Ogura not only blushed and had nothing more to say, but even the Japanese military police felt embarrassed. In the end, Inoue stepped in to smooth things over, first ordering Ogura to buy a ticket to Beiping and take care of his business. Any issues or punishments would be dealt with upon his return. Chen, who had been beaten for no reason, could only limp home on a half-day leave to recover, amidst the extreme sympathy and indignation of his colleagues.

The floating corpses in the Hai River remain a mystery to this day. Although the Third Detective Team of the Municipal Police arrested two people on the 8th of this month (one named Yang Xiang, one named Kong Zhaoyuan), both of whom were transferring corpses from opium dens in the Japanese concession. The authorities also believed that the corpses floating in the river for more than half a month were undoubtedly moribund drug addicts thrown out by the opium dens. However, on the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, corpses continued to be found in the river. Although the number varied, it contradicted the previous assumption. It made it unreliable to conclude that the floating corpses were discarded by the opium dens. Because after examination, not every floating corpse showed signs of drug addiction. What is even more unbelievable is that, although there are many opium dens in the Japanese concession, it is unlikely that seven or eight addicts would be on the verge of death from drug use every day, and it is even less likely that they would be thrown into the river at the same time. Even if someone were abandoned by an opium den for lack of money to buy drugs, they would only be thrown out the door and left to die. Why would they need to be killed, and why would they need to be thrown into the Hai River? Therefore, it is inferred that some people feel that this matter is somewhat suspicious, but if one investigates carefully, there is nothing to be surprised about. One thing that can be studied is that, since 1935, every spring, people in Tianjin have been recruiting laborers from Hebei and Shandong to go to Manchuria on behalf of the puppet government. For each person recruited, the recruiter can receive a commission of 2 to 5 yuan from a certain □□ company. The difference in the amount of commission depends on the distance of the future work site to which the laborer will be transported. Many people engage in this kind of work because it is profitable. Therefore, they are particularly enthusiastic when recruiting. Farmers in the hinterlands of Hebei and Shandong, forced by livelihood, disregarding the pros and cons of going to Manchuria, actually regard this as a shortcut. However, the laborers who are recruited to work in the puppet state work for one year at most and several months at least, working harder than cattle and horses every day. Each person is given only 20 cents for food per day, and they must work as usual in wind and rain. No wages are given in addition to food money. If the work is not done well, or if wages are inquired about, whipping is immediate. Those who try to escape are executed with torture upon being caught. By the time winter comes, when it is cold and frozen and inconvenient for construction, special vehicles are used to drive them back to Shanhaiguan. Therefore, all those who have been recruited deeply hate the recruiters. They spread the word, advising acquaintances or villagers not to go again. Therefore, in the past year or two, recruiters, in addition to using deception, have had no way to entice laborers to be tricked into going. This year, recruiters have had difficulties and are recruiting from thousands of miles away. They only seek to recruit more and quickly, and the deceptive means used are unscrupulous. Laborers recruited to Tianjin are all confined to a certain street in a certain concession, waiting to be transported out in batches. The reason why they cannot take the train is because the central government has issued a ban on laborers leaving Shanhaiguan. The authorities in Ji and Cha execute it vigorously. Recruiters fear that there will be obstacles. During the period of confinement, the treatment is extremely poor. Laborers gradually feel uneasy. Some ask to quit, while others attempt to escape without notice. Both of these are major violations of the recruiter's taboo. Those who quit are subjected to severe beatings and whipping until they are on the verge of death. Those who run away are caught and immediately thrown into the river. This tactic is nothing more than to prevent too many people from running away and spreading the word outside, affecting their recruitment work. This kind of situation is probably most deeply believed by those who are paying attention to the inside story of the floating corpse case. If this is proven by the fact that the detective team has arrested two criminals who transferred corpses on behalf of opium dens, and that plainclothes police are densely deployed along the Hai River, while corpses are still floating in the river, the above theory is even more reliable.

### A Certain Party's Conspiracy to Poison Shanxi

A Poisoning Plan with Extreme Secrecy; Military, Police, and Gendarmerie All Block It

Taoyuan Correspondence: A certain party is intensifying the poisoning of Shanxi with vicious means. The local authorities, having received the news, are also intensifying the blockade. Therefore, within less than ten days, two shocking major cases involving opium have been cracked, totaling 123 kilograms, worth more than 30,000 yuan. It is reported that a large amount of drugs will still be transported here in a steady stream. To strictly investigate and capture drug traffickers, the military, police, and gendarmerie have convened a meeting to inspect drugs. Attendees included Rong Honglu, police commander; Li Runfa, gendarmerie commander; Cheng Shurong, director of the provincial capital's public security bureau; Zhou Yongnan, director of the fourth branch of the Zhengtai Railway Police; and personnel from the Zhengtai Railway Police Bureau. It was decided to implement inspection methods. In addition to sending a large number of secret investigators to inspect trains, officers were also sent to inspect major stations in Yuci and Taigu. At the same time, the Taiyuan Station of the Zhengtai Railway implemented a joint inspection of passengers by military, police, and gendarmerie personnel. Anyone with suspicious behavior

Immediately undergo inspection of the drug trafficking organization.

Extremely Strict Secrecy: It is reported that a certain party definitely has a kind of plan to poison Jin Province. The source of making drugs is in a certain country's concession in Tianjin. Their means of poisoning are to first send a large number of traitors who have lost their minds, carrying a huge amount of drugs, sneaking into this province, secretly hiring gangsters and ruffians to sell them. Ordinary foolish people, feeling the generous gains, are willing to sacrifice their lives to do this for the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race. Currently, there are many gangsters and ruffians in Yuci, Taigu, and other areas who have been hired by traitors with money, each receiving 20 to 30 yuan per month. The money for the drugs sold is split in a 3-7 ratio, with the enemy getting 70% and the gangsters and ruffians getting 30%. There are also special incentives for those who can sell in large quantities. As a result, highly addictive drugs are smuggled into the province, and the drug-affected areas are expanding daily, and the degree of poisoning is also rapidly spreading. As for their smuggling method, after several traitors receive a large amount of drugs in Tianjin, they charter a boat or a car and transport it directly from Tianjin to Baoding in Hebei. They use the railway to smuggle it into Shanxi Province. As for the drug-transporting traitors, they dress gorgeously, take first or second-class trains, and even have business cards with considerable official titles, or in the name of managers and employees of certain large companies, to avoid the attention of inspection personnel. Wherever they go, their actions are unusually secretive, and they have accomplices to protect them. This time, the fourth branch of the Zhengtai Railway Police cracked two drug cases in Yuci in a row, and the drug dealers were such people. They have now fled to the Tianjin concession to take refuge.

Local Ruffians Pool Money to Traffic Drugs

In addition, there is another kind of drug trafficking organization, that is, local ruffians and villains pool money, each buying a certain number of shares, and sending people to Tianjin to traffic drugs. The surplus is distributed according to the shares. On the 6th of this month, Yan Dafu, a famous drug dealer arrested in Yuci, was the leader of this organization. The organization is called "Ten Big Shares," each share worth 10,000 yuan, subscribed by ten people. Yan serves as the commander-in-chief of the ten big shares. Every time he goes to Tianjin, he must bring back a large amount of drugs. Over the years, although the authorities have strictly investigated and arrested him, and sealed his property two or three times, this criminal still has more than 100,000 yuan in assets in various counties. Before his arrest, he still travelled frequently between Yuci and Tianjin. After a large amount of drugs were transported to Yuci, they were carried to Qi, Taiping, and other counties for sale. From this, it can be seen that these criminals are not afraid of death, but the dozens of counties in the central area have suffered greatly. Now that he has been arrested, it can be said that he has committed countless evil deeds. Even more serious, there are also shareholders in the transportation industry who participate in this organization and serve as informants in the transportation industry, secretly leaking information, causing the drug kingpins to escape. However, according to secret reports, there are several other smaller organizations of this kind, and the police and gendarmerie are currently investigating and arresting them.

Penetrating into Rural Areas to Harm Young People

The suffering in the local areas is truly unbearable. In the past, the price of opium and other drugs sold in various counties was 30 to 40 yuan per ounce. Recently, due to the enemy's intensification of the poisoning of Shanxi, the value of opium has been reduced to less than 10 yuan. The many people from wealthy families who use opium and become bankrupt and reduced to poverty are of course not worth mentioning. Even ordinary people, vendors, can get high once for 8 to 10 copper coins. Extremely poor people exchange stolen goods for drugs, resulting in an increasing number of addicts, most of whom are strong young people in rural areas. Currently, the counties in the central area of Qi and Taiping are heavily affected. What is even stranger is that in the past, opium had to be smoked with utensils using lamps, or through paper cigarettes. Recently, some people are even sniffing it through their noses. Opium also has red, grey, yellow, white, and other varieties. The reason why the enemy sells drugs at low prices and comes up with unique ideas and manufactures tricks is for the purpose of destroying our race and destroying the power to defend our land and resist the war. It is not only for profit.

Drug-Trafficking Traitors Sentenced to Death

Amidst the strict prevention and blockade of poisoning by the military, police, and gendarmerie, the authorities have decided to execute Yan Deshan, Liu Baoshan, Hu Xisan, and others who were apprehended by the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau in July of last year for colluding with Japanese people to traffic in opium. Liu Baoshan was identified as a drug-trafficking traitor with notorious acts. Therefore, Liu was immediately shot to demonstrate the punishment of one as a warning to a hundred. As for the details of the case, the Japanese people, Otsushi Jusan and Nakajo Yoshimi, residing at 16 Xinman City North Street, had not been staying there long when Jia Ruzhen, a retired officer from the Xinman City Police Station, discovered that Yan Deshan and Liu Baoshan were frequently interacting with these Japanese people and acting suspiciously. The First Bureau dispatched police to apprehend Yan Deshan at Xin South Gate, seizing a receipt from Yan for 65 yuan for trafficking in opium with Liu Baoshan. Liu Baoshan was apprehended at 68 Hongshan Street. Another accomplice, Hu Xisan, was also apprehended at 63 Wuchakou at the same time. During the interrogation, the bureau received a report that the Japanese people, Otsushi Jusan and Nakajo Yoshimi, planned to leave Taiyuan by train and escape to Tianjin, and that there was a large amount of opium in the hand-held luggage. The bureau dispatched First Bureau Chief Shi Zecheng and patrol team leader Ma Jiaren to investigate at Zhengtai Station. They apprehended the Japanese people and their luggage. They, together with the Chief of Shouyi Guanjie, conducted a detailed inspection at the bureau. They seized 18 gold lion yuan box opium, gross weight 2 pounds and 12 ounces. 9 red paper packages of Flying Dragon True Company opium, gross weight 11 pounds. 2 blue paper packages of opium, gross weight

## Page 10

2 pounds 6 ounces. 2 yellow paper packages of opium, gross weight 2 pounds 6 ounces. A prescription for mixing drugs, and two letters. The Japanese people claimed that the opium was brought from a foreign firm in Tianjin to Taiyuan. Due to poor sales, they were planning to bring it back to Tianjin. The authorities considered that the Japanese were trafficking in drugs to Jin, which was illegal. They dispatched personnel to send the Japanese people and the opium to the Japanese consulate in Zhengzhou for handling. The opium-trafficking criminals who colluded with the Japanese, Yan Deshan, Liu Baoshan, and Hu Xisan, were sent by the Public Security Bureau to the Yangqu County government for legal action. After strict interrogation by the county, they confessed to colluding with the Japanese to traffic opium and resell it to Zhang Erhu in Xugou. The county government drafted a verdict according to the law and submitted it to the Anti-Smoking Supervision Office to be forwarded to the Central Government for review. Recently, an instruction was received stating that Yan Deshan and Liu Baoshan, for trafficking in drugs, should each be sentenced to death according to Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations, and deprived of public rights for life. However, Yan had already died of illness. Only Liu Baoshan remained. On the 13th, at 12:00 noon, the county, together with the military, police, and gendarmerie, took him out of prison, verified his identity, and escorted him onto the execution vehicle to Da Nanmen. Liu was 58 years old, from Beiping. He was tall and had a fierce face. He was wearing a short blue cloth jacket and muttered incessantly. The execution vehicle passed through Gulou Street, Louerdili, Liuxiang, and Yangshijie. The crowds were so large that the road was blocked. When the criminal was executed, the leading military band, in addition to blowing horns, also added a large drum, attracting several times more spectators than usual. As for the accomplice Hu Xisan, because the interrogation was not clear, he is still being held in the Yangqu County government. How he will be dealt with is still unknown. (Thirteenth)

### Pinghan Railway Bureau Abuses Power to Arrest Party Committee Members

The Central Government Decides on a Solution; Explicit Order to Punish the Railway Bureau

Hankou Correspondence: A while ago, in the Pinghan Railway, Huang Changxi, deputy section chief of the Zheng County Locomotive Depot, organized an Employee Public Offense Unemployment Assistance Association without applying to the party headquarters for permission and forcefully collected membership fees, which caused conflicts among the employees. The railway bureau then abused its power and successively arrested and detained workers Huang Jinyuan and Li Haiyan, as well as Liu Songshan, Zhang Qingshan, Peng Yuchen, and others from the Fourth District Party Committee of the railway. On April 30, it further ordered the suspension of nine people, including Liu Songshan, for investigation. The turmoil continued to escalate. The lower-level party committees and trade unions of the entire railway unanimously requested the special party committee of the railway to forward the illegal points of the railway bureau to the Central Government for investigation. The Central Government attached great importance to this case and decided on four solutions. In addition to sending a letter to the Ministry of Railways ordering the dissolution of the illegal organization in Zhengzhou and the reinstatement of the suspended personnel, the railway bureau's abuse of power and unauthorized arrest of party committee members were explicitly ordered to be punished. On the 13th, the Central Ministry of Public Training sent a telegram to the special party committee of the railway, stating that the Central Government had approved four solutions to the case: ㊀ Send a letter to the Ministry of Railways, ordering the Pinghan Railway Bureau to explicitly dissolve the Employee Public Offense Unemployment Assistance Association of the Pinghan Railway Locomotive Section; ㊁ The railway bureau abused its power and unauthorizedly ordered the arrest of party committee member Liu Songshan and others; an explicit order to punish them; ㊂ The Huang Changxi assault case should be resolved through judicial means; ㊃ Before the assault case is resolved through judicial means, employees should not be dismissed under any pretext. The original positions of all employees, including Liu Songshan, should be immediately restored. In addition to the Central Government sending a letter to the Ministry of Railways to handle the above four points separately, it is specifically telegraphed for notification." (May 13)

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Establishes Paulownia Tree Experimental Field

Location: On the Shores of Taihu Lake

Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Taihu Lake area of Jiangsu Province has continuous mountains, roads encircling it, and increasingly convenient water and land transportation. The soil is fertile and suitable for planting paulownia trees. The provincial government believes that tung oil has always been a special product of our country and that its demand is increasing. It now plans to establish a paulownia tree experimental field on the shores of Taihu Lake, utilize barren mountains, and guide farmers to plant paulownia trees. It has been decided to use the Longquan Mountain and Maji Mountain surrounding Taihu Lake, which are more than thirty miles around, as the planting area. The area has water routes to Suzhou and Wuxi, and land routes have Xiyi Road running along the mountains, making transportation convenient. The planting plan is to rent 1,000 mu of mountain land in Longquan Mountain in the first year, and then rent more than 1,000 mu in the second year to plant paulownia trees, and sell seedlings to nearby farmers at a subsidized price to guide planting. In the third year, tung seeds can be harvested. All tung seeds produced by farmers will be purchased by the experimental field or crushed on behalf of them, or sold on their behalf. A marketing cooperative will be organized to sell directly to foreign merchants. It is estimated that after five or six years, it can be expanded to 100,000 mu. The field is now building three flat-roofed houses for office and staff dormitories, and eight thatched houses to store farm tools and for workers to live in. After the third year of harvesting tung seeds, the income will be used to gradually expand and establish a branch field in Maji Mountain. It is said that the estimated start-up cost is only 2,530 yuan, and the recurring expenses are 200 yuan per month.

### Songjiang

Robbery Resulting in Injury to the Victim

Cao Xuerong's family, farmers in Panbang Township, Fengjing Town, under this county's jurisdiction, were suddenly visited at about 1:00 AM on the 12th by seven or eight robbers speaking with a local accent, each holding wooden shell guns, etc. They broke into the house and looted it. The robbery lasted for one hour before they fled, having taken goods worth more than 400 yuan and injuring the homeowner. A loss report has been filed, and the arresting authorities have been asked to pursue the robbers.

### Kunshan

Commissioner Shi Arrives in Kunshan for Inspection

Shi Kuiling, the administrative commissioner of the First District of Jiangsu Province, arrived in Kunshan from Wuxi at 10:30 AM on the 13th. Accompanied by County Magistrate Wen and other welcoming personnel, they drove directly to the county government. Shi inquired in detail about the county's administrative facilities and inspected them for a week. He then gave a speech to the personnel of various agencies, police officers, students, etc., in the Zhongshan Hall. In the afternoon, he inspected various agencies and organizations, leaving a very good impression. He stayed overnight and left Kunshan to return to Wuxi on the morning of the 14th.

### Suzhou

Setting Boundary Markers on East Tai Lake

After the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, formulated two major plans for regulating East Tai Lake's water conservancy project: defining the lake boundary and dredging, they immediately dispatched a boundary marker engineering team to set steel-reinforced concrete boundary markers according to the designated lake boundary. Within the boundary, over 100,000 mu of lakeside fields, reeds, and grass滩 would need to be cleared. Landowners and tenant farmers considered the losses to be substantial and repeatedly appealed for a change in the regulation method, which was not approved. Currently, the boundary marker project covers a vast area, and the markers are being set segment by segment, all requiring machinery to be driven into the lake. It is estimated that it will take eight months to complete. This year, the lake fields can still be cultivated, so landowners, after receiving this news, have notified tenant farmers to transplant rice seedlings in a timely manner.

This year, Suzhou's spring silkworms have been raised with a total of 193,000 improved breeds. Deputy Director Zhang, from the Sericulture Improvement Zone, along with Wang Lianren and Zhou Hao, inspected the various villages and found the progress to be good. The silkworms in large batches have already undergone their third molt and are beginning to feed on leaves. However, based on the number of silkworm eggs this year, it is estimated that approximately 700,000 yuan worth of mulberry leaves will be needed, and the supply and demand can still be met. However, the price of leaves has already risen to 1.89 yuan per dan. As for the fresh cocoon harvest, it is projected to yield 19,000 shi dan of dry cocoons, a twofold increase compared to last year's harvest. However, the spring cocoons in the Guangfu cooperative area, with a total of 9,000 silkworm eggs this year, have suddenly shown signs of disease in two-thirds of the eggs, posing a significant blow to the harvest. Generally, silkworm farmers are extremely anxious. Therefore, the cooperative convened a silkworm farmer's meeting on the 14th to discuss relief measures.

Robbery Case in the Seventh District

Fei Xinru, a resident of Feijia Alley, Xi'an Bridge, Erli Xu, Anzhen South Township, in the seventh district of the county, is over 50 years old, has no children, and is wealthy, owning over 100 mu of fertile land, making him a target for criminals. Fei’s nephew, named Jia Tong, is over 30 years old and has a ten-year-old son. At midnight the night before last, over a dozen bandits suddenly arrived at Fei’s house, each wielding a weapon, and broke into the house. At that time, Xinru was awakened from his dream and climbed onto the roof, holding onto it, trying to stop the noise and search through the rooms, looting extensively. They robbed clothing, gold and silver jewelry, banknotes, and foreign currency, amounting to approximately 500 to 600 yuan in losses. As the bandits were leaving, they also tied up Jia Tong and his son. Xinru, upon seeing this, was extremely frightened and suddenly fell from the roof, suffering severe injuries to both feet. The next day, the bound child suddenly escaped from the bandits' lair, but Jia Tong's whereabouts are still unknown.

### Electricity and Mining Businesses Add Commercial Shares and Reorganize into Two Companies

One is the Yangtze Electricity Company, and the other is the Huainan Mining and Railway Company. The inaugural meeting of the promoters was held yesterday.

The inaugural meeting of the promoters of the Yangtze Electricity Company and the Huainan Mining and Railway Company was held at the China Construction Bank on Jiangxi Road on the afternoon of the 14th. Over forty promoters attended, including Zhang Renjie, Song Ziwen, Sun Ke (represented by Song Ziwen), Li Shizeng, Zeng Yanfu, Hu Bijang, Song Hanzhang, Du Yuesheng, Li Fusun, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Yunzhai, Song Ziliang, Bei Songsun, Yang J眉mei, Wang Lengbo, Wu Zhenxiu, Qin Yu, Huo Yamin, etc. After the formalities,

Chairman's Address

Temporary Chairman Song Ziwen delivered a speech, stating, "Today is the day for the inaugural meeting of the promoters of the Yangtze Electricity Company and the Huainan Mining and Railway Company. These two companies are being reorganized by the Construction Committee from its existing electricity and mining businesses by adding commercial shares. They are slightly different from ordinary companies, so I will explain their significance. The Construction Committee, in order to promote the development of domestic industry and agriculture, has devoted great efforts to the operation of electricity and mining businesses over the years. The Capital Electric Plant, the Qishuyan Electric Plant, the Huainan Coal Mine, and the Huainan Railway have all achieved significant results. The former's engineering and management are highly efficient, greatly promoting the development of industry in Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places. The latter, with its proximity to the Yangtze River, also plays an important role in supplying coal to central China. Now, the Construction Committee, in order to encourage public investment to expand domestic construction, intends to attract commercial shares to its existing successful businesses, organize companies, and continue operations. The funds raised will be used to initiate other businesses. Once they become successful in the future, they will be opened up for commercial shares again. This cycle of government raising funds, which is easy to manage, and the public investing in legitimate and stable channels, marks the beginning of joint construction between the government and the people, and thus lays the foundation for the nation's prosperity. Therefore, after the establishment of the two companies, it is hoped that they will continue to advance under the guidance and supervision of the Construction Committee, adhering to the main purpose of developing electricity and mining to support industry and agriculture, and striving to serve society. The development of the two companies' businesses can be foreseen."

Report on the Process

Next, Qin Yu, the representative of the Construction Committee, reported on the process of attracting commercial shares, stating, "The decision to attract commercial shares to the Construction Committee's electricity, mining, and railway businesses was made by the Central Political Committee at its 39th meeting. The National Government ordered the Construction Committee to formulate measures to reorganize the two electric plants in Nanjing and Qishuyan into Yangtze Electricity Co., Ltd., and the two Huainan Coal Mine and Railway Bureaus into Huainan Mining and Railway Co., Ltd., all in accordance with the Company Law. The capital for each company is set at 10 million yuan, divided into 100,000 shares, each worth 100 yuan. The Construction Committee will retain 20% of the shares, totaling 20,000 shares per company, amounting to 4 million yuan in national currency. The remaining 16 million yuan will be entrusted to the China Construction Bank to raise funds and handle the company's organization. This plan was approved by the Central Political Committee at its 43rd meeting and was followed by instructions from the National Government and notices from the Executive Yuan to the relevant ministries for their information. The 16 million yuan in commercial shares offered has now been fully subscribed by the China Construction Bank. All subscribers or their representatives are the promoters of the respective companies. Now, in accordance with Article 90 of the Company Law, the inaugural meeting of the promoters is convened." Next, the articles of association of the two companies were adopted, and directors and supervisors were elected before the meeting adjourned.

Statement of Purpose:

The Shanghai Guizhou Disaster Relief Association was established because Guizhou Province has unfortunately been hit by successive disasters. The root cause of these disasters is a prolonged drought. Guizhou is inherently a barren area with thin soil and shallow water. If rainfall is even slightly delayed, disaster is immediately apparent. This time, since the rain on March 27, 1936, there has been no rain for over a year. Of the 81 counties, 62 have been affected by the disaster, affecting a total of 2,762,276 people. This accounts for over 30% of the province's population of 9,195,514, which is unprecedented in recent years. The autumn harvest last year was already poor, and there were hopes for the spring harvest to make up for it, but the spring harvest was also disappointing, leading to the famine we see today. The land is scorched in all directions, with fields cracked and dried for thousands of miles. Rivers and wells have dried up, making drinking water scarce. In the past, famines only meant a shortage of grain and vegetables. Now, we see reports of drought and famine every day. Alas, how can the people of Guizhou endure this? As for the people, there is a shortage of grain, prices are high, and livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. The rich are becoming poorer, and the poor are becoming refugees. Even those who steal do not avoid the owners, and those who rob food do so in the streets. The reason for this is that they have no other choice. If we do not seek relief quickly, we fear that the starving people will resort to desperate measures, which will greatly affect public security. As for the land, grass roots have been dug up, tree bark has been stripped, and even white clay is being used to fill stomachs. Dirty water is used to quench thirst. Even more painfully, plows and hoes are hanging idle, and agriculture has collapsed. In recent months, along the eastern roads, we have seen groups of hundreds or thousands of cattle leaving the province. The same is true on other roads. Because agricultural tools are ineffective and they lack the resources to live, poor farmers have no choice but to sell the cattle they rely on for life, which is as painful as selling their children or breaking their bones. Even if there is widespread rain in the future, they will have no agricultural tools. The desolation at this point is deeply saddening. The above is just a general overview. There are countless other things that are unbearable to see or hear. Alas, the refugee map of Zheng Shi may not be able to depict this tragedy, and Zhao Meng's distribution of grain must wait for the future. Although the central government has allocated funds for relief, the disaster area is too large, and it is difficult to provide thorough relief. We, with our concern for disaster relief and our affection for our hometown, have joined forces to initiate relief efforts. We hope that the benevolent and the great of our time, with their compassion for the hungry and drowning, will make great efforts to help, whether by donating money or distributing food. By gathering sand to build towers and fur to make robes, we hope to gather the generosity and benevolence of all, with the mountains and rivers forever remembering the gifts of the heavens. The merit of saving lives and uniting flesh and blood is immeasurable. Therefore, Yingqin and others, on behalf of millions of disaster victims, respectfully plead and offer our heartfelt prayers. Respectfully submitted.

### Municipal Party Department Ordered to Protect Jincheng Bank's Normal Public Opinion and Support Civil Movement

Working together towards national rejuvenation and reconstruction, aligning the strengthening of the people's power with national policies.

According to Dagong News, the Municipal Party Department of Shanghai Special Municipality received Instruction No. 4848 from the Central Executive Committee: "The policy of supporting the people's movement and protecting legitimate public opinion has always been the consistent policy of our Party. The purpose of our Party's revolution is to awaken the people to seek freedom and equality for China. We advocate and cherish the people's speech and actions within the scope of the law. How can we suppress them? In recent years, the national crisis has deepened, and crises have arisen on all sides. In order to reverse the chaos and strengthen the foundation of the country, we must adhere to this consistent policy, allowing the people's speech to be fully expressed and supporting the people's movement at any time, so that the people of the whole country, under the leadership of our Party and its policies, can concentrate their will, unify their actions, and work together towards the arduous task of national rejuvenation, reconstruction, saving the nation, and ensuring its survival. As for the speech and actions of a few people who, due to their shallow knowledge or emotional biases, exceed the proper boundaries, or even use the beautiful name of patriotism to attempt to overthrow the government and endanger the Republic, they must be restricted or sanctioned according to law. In order to implement the above policy, we should intensify the training of the people, promote social education, and strive for local autonomy and cooperative movements, so that the people's knowledge is increased, their organizations are sound, and their lives are stable. We must ensure that everyone is a member of society who contributes their abilities to the country, so that the people's speech and actions can be aligned with the overall national policy of strengthening the people's power and concentrating the nation's power. In this way, our Party's policy of supporting the people's movement and protecting legitimate public opinion can be realized. In addition to sending letters to the National Government for separate implementation, it is also hereby ordered that the respective Party Departments and their subordinates understand and implement this intention. This is of utmost importance." The order was issued by Standing Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Ju Zheng, Feng Yuxiang, Ding Weifen, Ye Chucong, Kong Xianyi, Zou Lu, and Chen Lifu.

A Page of Brief History

The Kin Cheng Banking Corporation was established in the sixth year of the Republic of China [1917]. At that time, there were very few domestically established commercial banks, while the social economy urgently needed modern financial institutions. Therefore, Wang Zhu-san, Ni You-dan, Qu Li-qi, Duan Gu-xiang, Guo Shan-tang, Ren Zhen-cai, Wu Ting-chang, Chen Xing-lou, Xu You-zheng, Hu Bi-jiang, Zhou Tso-min, and others initiated the establishment. The founding meeting was held on April 22 of that year, and the opening ceremony was held on May 15. The bank's shares were originally set at 2 million yuan. In January of the eighth year, the full amount was collected. In October of that year, the shareholders' extraordinary meeting decided to change it to 5 million yuan. The full amount was collected in March of the eleventh year. At the shareholders' meeting in the twelfth year, it was decided to increase it again to 10 million yuan. By April of the sixteenth year, 7 million yuan had been collected. After approval from the Ministry of Finance in July of the twenty-first year, the actual amount received was used as the current fixed amount of shares. The head office was originally located in Tianjin and moved to Shanghai in January of the twenty-fifth year. The branches and offices added over the years numbered seven from the sixth to the ninth year, eight from the tenth to the sixteenth year, fourteen from the seventeenth to the twentieth year, and thirty-six from the twenty-first to the twenty-sixth year. By region, there are thirty-seven in the Yellow River basin, twenty-two in the Yangtze River basin, three in the Pearl River basin, and two in the Songhua River basin, for a total of sixty-five.

Business Policy

The business policy is divided into four stages: ㊀ From the sixth to the ninth year of the Republic, due to the initial establishment and weak strength, the business was mostly focused on commercial finance, proceeding prudently. ㊁ From the tenth to the sixteenth year of the Republic, the strength increased, and although the situation was turbulent and uneasy, in view of the urgent need for assistance in agriculture, industry, factories, transportation, and public utilities, the business was expanded in these areas. ㊂ From the seventeenth to the twentieth year of the Republic, the National Government was established, and economic construction was being prepared step by step. The bank's strength also increased, and it continued to serve agriculture, industry, mining, transportation, and public utilities. However, due to the still changing situation, it adhered to the principle of stability and did not dare to let go. ㊃ From the twenty-first to the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, the country gradually moved towards unification, and economic construction was actively promoted. The bank's strength also became more substantial, and it strived to serve various production, transportation, and public utility undertakings. By the end of last year, the commercial department had lent 95 million yuan, which was a ratio of 1 to 8 compared to the sixth year of the Republic. The savings department's investment was more than 44 million yuan, which was a ratio of 1 to 11 compared to the eleventh year of the Republic.

### Luo Jiezhi Plans Australian National Goods Exhibition

Overseas Chinese Organize Preparations; Chinese National Goods Company

The Shenzhou News Agency reported that Luo Jiezhi, specially dispatched by the Central Government to Australia to promote the New Life Movement, pays great attention to the overseas development of national goods. When he went abroad last year, he collected a large number of samples in Shanghai and took them with him. After consultation with overseas Chinese in Australia, it was decided to hold a grand national goods exhibition in October this year. At that time, it will coincide with the 150th anniversary of Australia, so the Australian authorities have also expressed their welcome. The Australian Department of Commerce has also allowed our exhibits to be imported duty-free, and the International Trade Bureau has also requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt export taxes. On the Australian side, 30,000 yuan has been prepared for the exhibition. Luo specifically sent a letter yesterday to the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association in this city to contact them. Before the conference, in addition to sending personnel back to China to help with the preparations, Luo himself will also return to China to prepare.

Organizing an Australian National Goods Company

Luo took national goods samples to Australia last year, which satisfied the overseas Chinese in Australia. They believe that there is a large market for Chinese goods in Australia and that they can gain a foothold. Luo will promote the establishment of an Australian Chinese National Goods Company by overseas Chinese. It is reported that the Australian side is already preparing and will send personnel back to China to contact the national goods industry for cooperation methods as soon as they are ready. It is found that trade between China and Australia is not very developed. Due to transportation habits and other factors, it is not as popular as the Nanyang market for Chinese people. Therefore, the national goods industry in this city believes that the establishment of a national goods company in Australia is necessary.

Meeting in the Next Few Days to Discuss Participation Methods

A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency specially visited Wang Xingyao, director of the National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association and deputy manager of the National Goods Chain Company, yesterday. According to him, Australia is indeed a good commercial market, but not many Chinese businessmen pay attention to it, so the upcoming exhibition is of great importance. In his personal opinion, it is necessary to participate. The method will be decided after consultation with the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association in the next few days. Wang also said that he heard that Japanese goods are very prevalent in the Australian market, so national goods must have a firm spirit to find a place. In the future, he hopes that overseas Chinese in Australia will return to China at any time to investigate and understand the progress of national goods, and have more contact with the national goods industry, so that they can understand what is suitable for sale in Australia, so as to open up new overseas markets.

They originally planned to fly to Beijing in a self-made plane with his wife, Ms. Huang, to pay respects to the central authorities, but the airport negotiations have to wait for a reply before they can proceed. Xu's return to China this time is not only for sightseeing and travel. He clearly stated at the banquet of the Aviation Construction Branch that he would inspect the domestic situation and strive for aviation construction under the guidance of the government. Therefore, he has been meeting with Dai Enji and Li Jingcong, the general managers of the China and Eurasia Aviation Companies, to discuss everything.

### Two Public Organizations Express Admiration

Chinese Employees of the Public Works Department Pay Taxes

The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to Mr. De Kui, the head of the Public Works Department, yesterday, stating, "We have read in the Shanghai newspapers of May 14 that you have created a monthly initiative to pay income tax, and we express our admiration. Income tax is the best direct tax of modern times. All nationals should pay tax according to the regulations based on their income, both to express obedience to the law and to show patriotism. However, foreigners use the protection of consular jurisdiction to refuse to pay income tax in the country where they are located, which is excusable because they are foreigners. However, a small number of nationals working in institutions under the protection of consular jurisdiction also refuse to pay income tax, but the majority do not because no one has taken the lead. You are honest, patriotic, and admired. Now you have taken the lead, which shows your enthusiasm for patriotism and makes people know that the Chinese nation cannot be underestimated. In addition to admiration, we should send a letter and hope to see the meaning and procedures of the initiative for reference, so as to promote and advocate it, and establish public friendship."

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Chinese Employees General Association of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating, "We have just seen in today's newspaper that Chinese employees of the Public Works Department voluntarily pay income tax on their salaries and wages, with a monthly tax amount of about 20,000 yuan. At this time when the country's administration is waiting to be developed and all expenses are needed, your colleagues enthusiastically contribute to legal and good taxes, and do not abandon their national duties because of the special circumstances of the withholding agency. All this shows your patriotism and law-abiding spirit, which is in line with the choice of those who know first and act first. In recent years, the international image has gradually improved, mostly due to the efforts of the people. Your colleagues' grand event this time will definitely give the international community a new impression and help promote the income tax of foreigners, which is a contribution to the country and is extraordinary. We extend our admiration and hope you will understand."

After performing the ceremony, Chairman Xiao Qingshan first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the union is holding the swearing-in ceremony for the 14th session of directors and supervisors today. He said that it is a great honor to have representatives from the higher authorities present to guide them. The union has been established for 14 years, and successive sessions have made considerable efforts and achievements in the work of saving the country, developing postal services, promoting the welfare of workers, and promoting the postal workers' movement. At the beginning of this session, they should continue to work hard towards this goal. Then, all the directors and supervisors swore an oath of office. After the ceremony, representatives from the higher authorities delivered training speeches one after another.

Speeches from Higher Authorities

㊁ Wang Jiashu, representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech. ㊁ Ye Xianggao, representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech. ㊂ Lu Jingshi, representative of the National Postal Workers Union, delivered a speech with much encouragement.

Discussion of Union Affairs

After the speeches by the representatives from the higher authorities, the chairman delivered a reply speech, followed by reports from various departments on recent union affairs and the work outline for this session. The budget for this session was also passed, and finally a declaration was published.

Inauguration Declaration

We, the directors and supervisors, hereby officially announce our sincerity and reveal our guiding principles on May 14 to inform all our members. The work of this union in the past has had three major goals: participating in the work of saving the country, developing postal services, and promoting the welfare of workers. These three are the motivation for the establishment of this union and the central goals that successive committees have worked diligently to achieve. The efforts in the past have achieved considerable results, and the efforts in the future cannot be relaxed at all. We, the directors and supervisors, swear to continue to advance according to this target. This is the first point. The National Postal Workers Union is not only the superior organization of this union, but also has a close relationship with this union. Whether in terms of vertical historical facts or horizontal regional aspects, the implementation of all work, the planning of plans, and the implementation of union affairs are all carried out under the belief that it is fate, and close mutual assistance and cooperation are carried out. In the future, we will strive to follow the public of our General Assembly to jointly seek the development of postal transport, and assist the General Assembly in building the Association and the Martyrs Cemetery, which are the most urgent tasks and one of the central tasks of this session. We, the directors and supervisors, swear to do our best to ensure that the General Assembly and the Martyrs Cemetery can be completed as soon as possible, so that the national postal workers have a place to belong and the souls of the martyrs have no regrets. This is the second point. Successive committees have regarded the promotion of postal workers' rapid careers as one of the work guidelines, but due to various practical difficulties, they have failed to achieve their full success. We, the directors and supervisors, deeply understand the members' earnest expectations and heavy entrustment, and dare not follow the unfulfilled ambitions of the previous committees, and move forward bravely, seeking practical benefits and not advocating empty words. On the one hand, we will assist the General Assembly in promoting the completed and uncompleted undertakings, and on the other hand, we will establish our own standards and plan for implementation. This is the third point. Since the implementation of the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, it has achieved remarkable results. The association has cooperated with the postal authorities in its implementation, but has placed too much emphasis on form and little practical effect. In the future, we should step up our work, focus on practical results, and pay attention to the promotion of the thrift movement. This is the fourth point. The above four points are only the general outlines of the work of this session. Other matters that are beneficial to the country, society, postal services, and the members themselves will be done to the best of our ability, so as to complete our mission and live up to the expectations of all members. At the beginning of this inauguration, we offer our meager efforts and hope that all our members will learn from them. This is our declaration.

### Large Quantities of Legal Tender Transported to Yunnan

According to the Shin Shi News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the Currency Circulation Management Policy on November 4, 1935, it has been stipulated that the people of the country should not use cash. However, in order to remedy the situation for the people in the border areas, the time limit has been extended. Now, all border provinces have gradually implemented the policy. The Yunnan Provincial Government has now decided to implement it from the 15th of this month. After all payments within the province are made in legal tender and cash is no longer used, there is a great need for legal tender. Therefore, in recent days, a large amount of legal tender and newly minted subsidiary coins have been transported from Shanghai's Fu Kang New Bank to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications.

### Nanny Kidnaps Child Case on Gonghe Road, Zhabei

The Victim Has Been Rescued in Jiangbei and Brought Back to Shanghai; Ransom Demanded Was 20,000 Yuan, Five Men and Women Arrested

Ji Aiyun, a local man who works as a pattern maker in the Shanghai Municipal Council's pattern room at No. 208, Hexing Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, had a young son named Gengshou (also known as Genshou) who was only fifteen months old. He hired a nanny, Shen Chen (also known as Chen San Guniang), age twenty-seven, from Baoying County. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the fourth of last month, Chen suddenly took Gengshou away without a trace. The Ji family searched everywhere without success. Later, they suddenly received a letter from the nanny demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Only then did they learn that the child Gengshou had been kidnapped by Chen. After receiving the ransom letter, the Ji family once prepared the ransom money according to instructions. However, Chen suddenly became fearful and dared not appear. Until April 13, the Ji family learned that the nanny was having an affair with Zhang Guisheng, who ran a clothing store in Hexing Lane across the street, and discovered that Zhang was hiding in the Hutingzi room of a Mr. Hu, the second landlord at No. 90, Yingqing Lane, Jisi Feier Road, Shanghai West. They secretly reported this to the New Zhabei Police Station, which dispatched Qian Tianxiong, captain of the sixth team of the detective squad, along with detectives, to arrest Zhang Guisheng, who had changed his name to Wang Asi. Zhang confessed that the nanny must be sending letters, so Zhang Guisheng was sent to the Shanghai District Court in custody. Meanwhile, detective Miao Yizhong was dispatched to wait in the Hutingzi room at No. 90, Rongqing Lane. At about 10:00 PM on the fourth of this month, the nanny's lover from Jiangbei, Wang Beikui (also known as Wang Bo Kui), age forty, from Sanmin Township, Huai'an County, suddenly knocked and entered. He was arrested by detective Miao and taken to the team. He confessed that the victim was hidden in a straw shed outside the east gate of Baoying County, Jiangbei. Based on this confession, that evening at 11:00 PM, Captain Qian dispatched Liu Bingyuan, leader of the squad, and detectives Liu Heng and Wu Songshan, along with informants, to take a train to Zhenjiang, cross the river, and then take a long-distance bus to Baoying. They met with the local police station at their destination. Unexpectedly, the victim had been moved elsewhere. After trying to investigate, they encountered the local garrison headquarters, which was also arresting people in connection with this case. Detective Liu and others explained the situation, and both sides jointly went to Yangqiao Town, bordering Huai'an, where the town chief, Wang Boquan, dispatched villager Zhao Shenglu to assist in finding Shen Chen and the victim Ji Gengshou in the grass shop cotton quilt in the kitchen of Gao Ji'an (also known as Gao Ma Miao) at Gaoma Bridge. They also arrested Ding Wenduan, a resident of Yangqiao Town, age forty-six, who was living in the dilapidated temple. Previously, a suspect, Fan Yutai, age thirty-nine, from Sanmin Township, Dahe Township, was also arrested. They were taken to the Zhenjiang Provincial Police Bureau for questioning along with the victim. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, they were escorted to Shanghai. The child was immediately handed over to the victim's family, Ji Aiyun. A total of four suspects were arrested, excluding Zhang Guisheng (also known as Wang Asi), who had been handed over to the Shanghai District Court. The remaining four, including Shen Chen, Wang Beikui (also known as Wang Bo Kui), Fan Yutai, and Ding Wenduan, are currently under interrogation. Yesterday afternoon, when the Ji family and other women visited the sixth squad of the detective team of the New Zhabei Sub-bureau, the nanny knelt on the ground and bowed her head, begging for forgiveness.

### Half-Brothers Fight Over Mother's Coffin

Both Sides Involved in a Lawsuit

The late Shen Yonglin, a local man, lived in the Shanghai East area. He married Shen Chen and had two sons, Shen Gengen, currently fifty-four years old, and Shen Gengsong, currently fifty years old, both living at No. 996 Huishan Road. However, when Shen Yonglin passed away, Shen Gengen and others were still young. Their mother had no choice but to marry Zhou Maoquan as a concubine (commonly known as "fang'erhuang," or a husband to prevent the land from going to the children). After they lived together, they also had two sons, Shen Hongshun (also known as Linsheng), who is the General Manager of the Hongshun Elevator Manufacturing Factory, the Taishan Elevator Factory, the Taishan Printing House, the Yongtai Insurance Company, and others, and Shen Quansheng, who lives at No. 41, Lane 343, Huade Road. Zhou Maoquan also passed away. In 1934, Shen Chen also passed away. Her coffin was temporarily placed in the Datong Public Hall in Yinxiang Port. In March of this year, Shen Gengen and Shen Gengsong moved their mother's coffin to their late father Shen Yonglin's burial plot to be officially buried as his first wife. Shen Hongshun and Shen Quansheng believed that their mother had married their late father Zhou Maoquan and should be buried with Zhou. They gathered a crowd and robbed the coffin. At that time, the defense corps and police were involved, and the situation was chaotic and unapproachable. Therefore, the coffin is now in the Zhenru Defense Corps. Shen Gengen and Shen Gengsong sued Shen Hongshun and Shen Quansheng in the First Special District Court for stealing the coffin and for using firearms to commit violence. They also said that Shen Hongshun's father was a concubine with the surname Zhou, and that Hongshun and others still have the surname Shen, so they should not have taken away the coffin of the Shen surname. The Special Court ruled that the case should be handled by the Chinese Court. Therefore, Shen Gengen and others hired lawyer Feng Song to file a complaint with the Nanshi Court. The case was accepted for review and handling yesterday.

### The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau Oversees Inland Waterway Steamers

The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau yesterday instructed the local Inland Waterway Steamer Industry Association to order all small steamers to submit reports on their routes and schedules for record-keeping. The following is a transcription:

Order from the Navigation Administration Bureau

It has been found that Article 15 of Chapter 3 of the Steamship Supervision Regulations stipulates that once the schedule of regular steamships is determined, it should be reported to the competent navigation administration authority for record-keeping. Subsequently, no changes may be made without reporting the matter and requesting approval. The regulations have been issued and separately ordered to be followed. However, no reports have been submitted to date. Now, a form for reporting regular steamship information is printed and 150 copies are issued. You are ordered to forward them to the companies and firms for completion and submission for review. You must comply with this order. Director Wu Yu.

Reporting Items

㊀ Name of the ship, ㊁ Ship owner, ㊂ Route, including the starting point, ending point, and names of ports along the route, ㊃ Schedule, ㊄ Passenger capacity, ㊅ Cargo capacity, ㊆ Passenger fares, ㊇ Number of trips per month, ㊈ Whether there is cooperation on this route, ㊉ Other, ㊉㊀ Remarks, Instructions: (A) The "Route" column should be limited to actual navigation and stops.

### The Taxpayers' Association Requests the Shanghai Municipal Council to Increase Night Patrols to Prevent Theft

Private Lanes Cannot Be Left Unprotected

The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Public Concession sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday stating: "According to Wang Yaochen's letter, his residence is located at No. 18, Miaolong Lane, Hardoon Road, in the Public Concession. On the night of April 28, thieves broke in and stole two pairs of white copper candlesticks, four legs from a purple copper incense burner, three copper kettles, clothing, and other items worth about 150 yuan. The incident was reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station the next morning, but despite their investigation, the case has not been solved. The reason for the theft is that no police officers are stationed in Miaolong Lane, which is called a private lane. Although we merchants live in Miaolong Lane, our tax obligations are the same as those who live on the main road of Jing'an Temple. The Shanghai Municipal Council should fulfill its responsibility to protect us. The patrol officers on the day and night shifts should be stationed on the main road, which makes sense. Your association is a fair organization for Chinese taxpayers in the concession. Therefore, we hereby request your association to strongly advocate to the Shanghai Municipal Council to send night patrol officers to our lane to patrol according to regulations. We anxiously await your response."

### Pudong Public Buses Stop Running Too Early

Pudong Avenue Should Install Streetlights

The public buses from Dongchang Road in Pudong to Yangjing District, established by the Public Utilities Bureau for trial operation, have indeed facilitated the travel of the public. However, the operating hours are limited because there are no streetlights installed on that route, making it difficult for the buses to run at night. Currently, the last bus from Dongchang Road is at 7:00 PM, and the last bus from Yangjing is at 8:20 PM. As the summer days are longer and there are many travelers, the fact that the buses stop running around 8:00 PM is too early. Passengers hire rickshaws, but ㊀ the price is high and the journey is slow, and ㊁ robbers roam the desolate countryside. There have been frequent reports of rickshaw passengers (from Dongchang Road to Yangjing) being robbed. In the event of rain, the mud roads are difficult to travel, and passengers are full of complaints. One petitioner has requested the municipal government to consider extending the operating hours to around 10:00 PM or 10:30 PM during these long summer days, and to install streetlights to facilitate nighttime travel.

### Postal Clerk Accused of Embezzling Airmail Letter Granted Bail

Defendant Claims to Have Followed Regulations; Court Finds It Necessary to Summon Witnesses

Luo Dezhong, a local postal clerk at the Fujian Road Post Office, was accused of embezzling an airmail letter sent from the Yunkang Company in Yunnan to Shanghai, containing eighteen winning airmail lottery tickets worth a total of 1,100 yuan. The Lao Zhabei Police Station prosecuted him in the First Special District Court for embezzlement. After a hearing, Luo was ordered to be detained. The details of the case were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the First Special Court, continued the hearing. Luo Dezhong hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend him. First, the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that during the adjournment, the police had investigated with the Central, China, and Communications Banks to determine whether the prize money for the eighteen lottery tickets had been claimed by the defendant. However, the banks replied that the lottery tickets were all claimed by the lottery ticket agents, so they could not identify the claimants. The lawyer also mentioned that in the same month that this case occurred, the Fujian Road Post Office had also lost a registered letter containing a draft for 6,000 yuan, suspecting the defendant was also involved. However, according to the Post Office's investigation, the defendant had not been assigned to the Fujian Road Post Office when the letter was lost, so he was not related to the case. The discovery of the case was due to the Yunkang Company in Yunnan sending a letter urging the remittance of the prize money. The letter has been retrieved today. When questioned, the defendant Luo Dezhong stated that because the letter from Yunkang was torn, he followed the Post Office's regulations and instructed postman No. 715 to deliver the notice to the recipient. Before long, someone came to claim the letter with the notice. After verifying that the seal affixed to the notice matched the recipient's signature on the letter, he delivered the letter. Therefore, he should not be held responsible. Furthermore, his colleague Gao Zunyi was fully aware of this matter. The court then deemed it necessary to summon Gao to testify and adjourned the hearing. Luo was granted bail upon payment of 2,000 yuan in cash or a surety.

### Department Head of the Ministry of Communications Shao Nantang's Extortion Case Has Concluded

The Court Summoned the Plaintiff and Witnesses Yesterday; The Defendant Will Be Sentenced on the 20th and Remains in Custody

Shao Nantang, a native of Ningbo and the head of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, had a residence in Shanghai at No. 1, Chongye Lane, Limengji Road, in the French Concession, where he lived with his four wives. From the 7th to the 18th of last month, his Shanghai residence received three threatening letters demanding 1,800 yuan. Shao's wife, Shao Li, after receiving the second letter, entrusted her fellow villager, Lu Zhongfen, the head of the Shanghai Baoshan District Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol, to contact the extortionist through Liu Zhiming from Jiaxing. On April 18, upon receiving the third letter, they handed Liu 150 yuan the following day and instructed him to open a room at the Mengyuan Hotel for the meeting. At the same time, they reported the matter to the French Concession Police Station and requested protection. Detectives followed Liu to the Mengyuan Hotel to wait, but they did not see the extortionist. They only saw Liu pacing up and down the stairs. They followed Liu to Yu Qiaqing Road and, suspecting his behavior, took him to the police station. It was discovered that Liu had previously been sentenced to five years in prison for kidnapping. Liu also admitted to sending letters to the Shao family for extortion. Therefore, Liu was sent to the Second Special District Court. During interrogation, Liu confessed that Shao Li hated her adopted son, Shao Ruixin, for being unfilial and asked Lu Zhongfen to entrust Liu with escorting Ruixin to the Pingyang Security Team in Wenzhou to serve as a soldier, paying him 30 yuan for expenses. Upon arriving in Pingyang, Ruixin became ill, and after spending all the expenses, Liu had to pay 69 yuan for medical expenses. Liu returned to Shanghai and asked the Shao family for reimbursement, but they refused. Therefore, he asked a Mr. Wang to write letters to the Shao family for extortion. The court ordered him to be detained for investigation. The details of the case were previously reported. During the investigation, the police also arrested suspect Wang Zhixi. After investigation, it was determined that he was not involved in the case, and the court released him. Meanwhile, the police lawyer prosecuted Liu Zhiming for attempted extortion. However, during the second hearing presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian, Liu recanted his confession, denying the charges and accusing the Shao family of falsely accusing him. The court adjourned the hearing to summon witnesses. Yesterday, another hearing was held. According to Liu Zhiming, Lu Zhongfen called him on April 14 and asked him to go to the Datong Hotel to discuss the matter. He had seen copies of the first and second threatening letters. The first letter was dated March 5, and the second letter was dated April 12. At the Datong Hotel, Shao's son-in-law, Lu Shiying, and a Mr. Cai told him that Shao Li, after receiving the threatening letter of March 5, was afraid that her son Shao Ruixin was not safe at home, so she asked him to send Ruixin to Wenzhou. The postal stamp on the postage stamp on the first letter has been torn off, indicating that the date does not match. He arrived in Shanghai from Zhejiang on March 18. He did not write the threatening letters and was falsely accused. He asked for justice. The court ordered the plaintiff, Shao Li, and witnesses Shao Lijin, Lu Shenfen, and Lu Shiying, to be summoned to court. After questioning, it was found that witness Mr. Cai had gone to Yunnan and could not be present. At this point, the court considered the facts of the case to be clear and ordered the opening of arguments. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, and the defendant's lawyer exchanged arguments. The court then declared the debate closed and set the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 20th. The defendant Liu Zhiming remains in custody pending instructions.

### Zhou Zhizhang Released Due to Insufficient Evidence

Zhou Zhizhang, a native of Anhui, was suspected of being involved with lawyer Wang Shuqiao and Hong Yaosheng in the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. After being arrested by the Lao Zhabei Police Station and tried by the First Special District Court, he was declared not guilty due to insufficient evidence. Wang and Hong had already been released. Zhou was still detained because he was also suspected of robbing a large sum of money from the British Bank. Now, after investigating the case, the police also decided not to prosecute the British Bank case due to insufficient evidence and decided not to appeal the Zhao assassination case. Therefore, the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, applied to the First Special District Court for his release yesterday morning. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal division, approved the application and revoked Zhou's detention order, releasing him in court.

### Jiang Tian Assistant Accountant Qiu Weizhang Embezzles Public Funds

Cai Zengji, general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, through legal counsel Jiang Hechun, filed a lawsuit in the local court against Qiu Weizhang, assistant accountant of the Jiang Tian steamer, alleging that he left his post without permission on December 9 last year when the ship was docked in Shanghai. Subsequently, Zhang Dingzhi, director of the accounting office of the bureau, reported that the employee had embezzled public funds of 525 yuan and 78 cents. In addition to deducting the employee's salary, his brother Qiu Songfu repaid the outstanding amount in cash in installments. The employee was apprehended with the assistance of the Jiangyin County Government and a letter was sent to the bureau requesting the dispatch of police to escort him back for interrogation. However, although the employee had repaid the money, he still committed the crime of Article 336, Paragraph 1 of the Penal Code. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing heard the case.

### Murder Suspect Diagnosed with Mental Illness, Acquitted Due to Insanity, But Subject to One Year of Guardianship

On April 14 this year, at around 6:00 AM, in front of the No. 2 cargo warehouse on the Huangpu River pier of the French Concession near the China Merchants Bureau pier, an unidentified man, about sixteen or seventeen years old, who had been a dock worker for three years, was struck on the back of the head with a hard wooden stick, his brains splattered, and he died instantly.

He was handed over to the Second Special Court, and the lawyer from the Police Affairs Office filed a public prosecution for murder under Article 171 of the Criminal Code. During the interrogation by Judge Chen Shuoying, the defendant became ill in court and wielded the hard wooden stick, the murder weapon seized by the police, attempting to strike people.

### Three Thieves Arrested on the Spot for Attempted Robbery in Chunyangli

At around 10:30 AM yesterday, five bandits suddenly went to a certain residence at No. 21 Chunyangli, Dongyouheng Road, to commit robbery. The men and women in the house at the time did not dare to move because they saw the muzzle of a gun faintly exposed in one of the bandit's sleeves and let them do as they pleased. However, a servant was left in the back room, which the bandits did not notice. When the servant saw that things were not good, he took the opportunity to escape and ran to the entrance of the alley to call for help. The nearby police station received the report and immediately notified the police. In an instant, detectives gathered. Just as they were preparing to encircle and arrest the bandits, the bandits in the house were also alerted. They didn't have time to rob anything and immediately withdrew and fled. Two of the bandits fled towards a branch alley, and three bandits fled towards the main alley, where they met the detectives head-on and were arrested. A fake pistol was also seized.

### Jin Xin Silk Factory Workers Insult Social Bureau Investigator

Forcing the investigator to answer various questions, burning ghost money and tin foil on the spot to insult him.

Zhang Chuqiang, an investigator from the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, was dispatched on the 23rd of last month to investigate the labor dispute at the Tianhua Silk Factory. Zhang then went to the Silk Weaving Industry Association of the Fourth District at No. 138 Tonglefang, Huacheng Road at 3:00 PM. It turned out that the association was holding a meeting at that time, and workers from various factories were gathered. At that time, some workers from the Jin Xin Silk Factory demanded that Zhang report on the investigation of the labor dispute at the factory and asked Zhang to answer several questions. Zhang refused, stating that he was here for the Tianhua Factory incident and was not dispatched to report on the Jin Xin Factory incident. However, the workers repeatedly pressed him, insisting that he report. Zhang had no choice but to give a brief report and answer the questions slightly. Unexpectedly, Dong Chenggao, Long Zhengqian, Xu Shunfa, and other representatives of the Jin Xin Silk Factory suddenly burned ghost money, tin foil, etc. as an insult, while surrounding Zhang and preventing him from leaving. Fortunately, the workers of the Tianhua Factory protected him from being insulted. Subsequently, the police learned of the incident and ordered detectives to arrive and rescue Zhang. Zhang returned to the bureau chief and sent a letter to the procuratorate of the First Special Court, requesting investigation and prosecution. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Tang Peiyou opened the Fourteenth Court to investigate. The police also had lawyer Li Zhishan present in court. Only Dong Chenggao, one of the defendants, was present. Zhang Chuqiang voted in favor of the previous situation. When asked of Dong Chenggao, he completely denied it. Tang Jun stated that further evidence was needed and ordered a postponement for further investigation. Dong Chenggao was taken into custody.

### "Nationality" Problem

— Yun Hai

Originally, there was fundamentally no basis to even discuss sportsmanship, and the unruly behavior on our country's playing fields is something we are already familiar with. At the same time, the system of "sports stars" has led to general leniency towards athletes, and as a result, general "stars," as well as aspiring stars, have become arrogant and dismissive. However, recently there has been a "court case on the playing field." That is, in the basketball game between the attached high schools of Great China University and Guanghua University on the 20th of last month, Great China University's team members ganged up and injured referee Wu Zibin. As a result, Wu filed a lawsuit with the local court against the captain of the Great China University team, charging him with assault. This court case on the playing field "opened for trial on the 10th. During the trial, a new issue arose when the defendant, Lin Jianxian, claimed, "I have already acquired Dutch nationality, and jurisdiction is a problem." However, because he could not provide evidence, the judge continued the proceedings. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge stated, "Before the defendant provides evidence of nationality, he must post bail of 500 yuan and await further hearings outside of custody."

Here, I do not want to comment on this case; the result will be determined by the law. What I want to say is what I thought of regarding our countrymen's concept of the nation based on this.

I have previously heard locals in Shantou, Xiamen, and other places say: If a Chinese national commits a crime and is arrested by the Chinese authorities, they can still lobby a certain country's consulate to obtain a nationality card. At the same time, as long as they declare to the authorities that they have "acquired a certain nationality," they can be released unconditionally. This kind of attempt to escape one's own crime by relying on the special influence of foreign countries is actually intentionally undermining one's own country's judicial organs. This is precisely giving foreigners a major excuse to refuse to abolish consular jurisdiction.

In reality, since one inherently belongs to the Chinese people, even if one has acquired foreign nationality, if one still has love for China, one should absolutely obey the laws of one's motherland. This can almost be said to be a noble duty that is beyond reproach. If one attempts to escape the scope of legal constraints by acquiring foreign nationality, this is truly an incurable mentality of national destruction.

## Page 20

In the last hundred years, our country's progress has been constrained by unequal treaties such as consular jurisdiction. Recently, those with a sense of justice, those seeking national liberation, and patriots have loudly called for: the automatic abolition of consular jurisdiction; or demanding that countries enjoying special privileges in China voluntarily renounce consular jurisdiction. However, there are still treacherous merchants who take "having acquired a certain nationality" as an honor, and there are also young people who use having acquired foreign nationality as a way to escape Chinese legal sanctions. That is truly the shame of the Republic of China.

We know that the main reason foreign countries demand to enjoy consular jurisdiction in China is the excuse that China's judicial organs are not on the right track and that prisons are dark. Of course, this is also partly satirizing the inadequacy of our country's judicial organs; however, as a result of the loud calls from all sides in recent years, improvements are being made daily. And those who take having acquired foreign nationality as a way to escape Chinese legal sanctions are directly undermining judicial administration, making it more difficult for judicial organs; and indirectly giving foreigners a great excuse to delay the abolition of consular jurisdiction. Perhaps these losses and benefits are something that these people, who are purely self-serving and think themselves clever, have not thought of. But if they were to occasionally compare these advantages and disadvantages, perhaps they would be ashamed of their behavior?

Of course, this article does not necessarily refer to anyone in particular, but it is an expression of feelings after reading the newspaper. However, I dare to believe that there are people who harbor this mentality of national destruction. However, the entire society should also bear responsibility for the psychological formation of such people. Because fundamentally, they lack faith in China and blindly worship foreign countries. This, firstly, can be said to be the failure of our country's education. Secondly, it should be said that our countrymen have always had a weak concept of the nation; and the creation of this weakness should largely be attributed to the fact that the country has provided too little help to the people: If Chinese people face the outside world with their status as Chinese people, it is really too unprotected. So, this organic causal relationship awaits our efforts. Of course, the people should restore trust in the country; but the country should also live up to the people's trust.

### Six Active Puppets

— Li Wei

In a children's sports field in a park in western Shanghai, to celebrate the coronation of the British monarch, six newly installed active wooden puppets were set up. Three were black people wearing headscarves under their rule, and the other three were wearing mandarin jackets and melon-cap hats, presumably representing Chinese people. The way to play was to shoot with an air gun, and if you knocked down a certain puppet, you would win. Quite a few Chinese people also participated in the shooting.

### A Bitter Face Without Expression

— Lao Xin

One evening in April, I was walking along ×× Road...

My mind was very confused, and I didn't know what I was thinking about. I was walking very hurriedly as usual.

Suddenly, piercing my ears was a conscious piece of news, carrying terror, the continuous ringing of the streetcar's foot bell: ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding: ...

I shuddered and instinctively quickly turned around to look for the object of my impression in my mind.

What flashed before my eyes, I'm afraid there was only the allowance of a second, and the tragedy caused me great pain for several days.

It was a × Road streetcar with a trailer, and the streetcar driver was frantically ringing his foot bell. Looking forward through the gaps in the streetcar, I saw a ragged black figure. Just as we can see the speed of lightning before thunder during a rain, this black figure was kissed by the streetcar and swallowed under the wheels of this ruthless demon. Following that, the streetcar screeched to a halt...

In front of us was a "silent scene." However, this did not last long. It can almost be said that at the same time, the people in the shops on both sides, who had witnessed this tragedy with me, were exclaiming in unison: ——"Ah—ya!"

After that, the road began to present a very chaotic scene.

People came crowding in from all directions. And I, I didn't know when I had walked into the crowd, and I was standing in the first row.

Like most people, my eyes also fell on this thrilling picture of life.

A bitter face without expression, smeared with dark black blood, looked very cold, and the blurred and anxious streetcar driver and conductor, very carefully and very forcefully, were trying to drag this victim from under the wheels of the demon. And this poor old woman (this is what I later discerned.) did not groan or suffer, and obeyed others' arrangements.

Before this work was finished, three or four ticket inspectors and patrol officers came. Their task was to treat the crowd with sympathy (perhaps some were not) with the faces of fierce wolves. They were shouting, pushing the crowd backwards with force.

This task was to make way for a line of emotionless cars to pass through behind, so as not to obstruct traffic.

I was squeezed onto the sidewalk, and the two older people next to me even fell. But these losses were almost nothing to us, and after a while we squeezed forward again.

At this time, the elderly victim was dragged up, and two unknown passers-by supported her arms, almost pressing her to stand there.

This was a numb, poor old woman. Because of her clothing, I heard another person ask:

"Is it an old man or an old woman?"

She herself would not answer, and no one cared about these things.

"Hey, hey! What about the car?"

Behind the streetcar that caused the accident was a long line of streetcars and buses. Therefore, a patrol officer said: And the center of this tragedy then shifted to the driver who was recognized as the culprit.

Because of the accused murderer, at this time his face was pale, and sweat drops had condensed into transparent beads on his forehead. He was anxious and annoyed, his eyebrows were deeply furrowed, and his slightly upturned lips were set in a grimace. He stepped off the car for a moment, then got back on the car again. And the passengers in the first-class cars, however, walked down with bitter faces, covering their noses with snow-white handkerchiefs, and disappeared into the crowd.

However, the wise order maintainers quickly decided: After copying down the murderer's number, the streetcar should drive away. And the driver, in a daze, got on the car, drove a few steps, and then stopped again: After that, he drove away again. I also saw his anxious face turn around from the car, staring blankly for a few moments.

At this time, about half an hour had passed since the tragedy began. Only then did I hear a sentence about the victim:

"Has an ambulance been called?"

"Ah!"

That bitter face without expression, still without groaning, without pain, was like a wax statue.
