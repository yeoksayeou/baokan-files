### Our New Front Extends Fifty Kilometers; Enemy Advances from All Directions Repelled

Heavy Fighting in Zhabei Last Night, Enemy Suffered a Crushing Defeat and Retreat; Yong'an Bridge: Our Army's Broadsword Squad Engaged the Enemy in Close Combat; Enemy Forces Repeatedly Coveting Pudong, Situation Tense

After our army retreated to the first line of defense, in addition to deploying heavy troops along the line, there were still several points in front of the line of defense, setting up a line of vigilance, confronting the enemy. Our army's current new front, from North Station to Baziqiao, Jiangwan, Dachang, Liuhang, and then to Luodian, Liuhuo, is actually the original front when the January 28th Incident occurred. However, at present, our army's line of vigilance still starts from Xinzhen between Luodian and Yuepu, passes through Yong'an Bridge (between Yanghang and Liuhang), and extends to Miaohang, then from the First Public Cemetery, crosses the west end of Sanmin Road to Baziqiao House and Chengzhong Hospital near the Jiangwan Racecourse, and turns to Huangxing Road to reach the border of Ningguo Road in the eastern concession. The entire line is fifty kilometers long, with strong fortifications, sufficient for defense. According to the report received last night, enemy troops on all lines had intentions to advance, resulting in contact, especially in the Zhabei area. Enemy troops constantly harassed from the beginning to the end of the night. The sound of machine guns and rifles could be heard from time to time. The fighting was particularly fierce from 12:00 midnight to around 2:00 AM this morning. However, our army responded calmly and dealt the enemy a heavy blow. The enemy made no progress.

In order to avoid the threat of enemy naval gun fire and to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, our army withdrew the positions in the city center and the Yinxiang Township area the day before yesterday (13th) and retreated to the first line of defense. The troops of our army that withdrew from the city center area are stationed east of Songhu Road, guarding the line from Gaojingmiao to the International Recreation Ground. The enemy troops then invaded the line from Lujiajiao (west of the City Sports Field) to Sijing Ball Field (near Yangjiazhai on Yingaolu Road). Since midnight the day before yesterday, they have repeatedly advanced on us. Our army responded calmly, waiting for the enemy to approach, then using machine guns to densely sweep, and using hand grenades to attack the enemy. As of yesterday afternoon, the enemy had not succeeded. As for the troops of our army that withdrew from the Yinxiang Township area, they are stationed on the Huangxing Road line, and the right wing still occupies the northern line of the concession, with no changes. The enemy in the eastern part of Yinxiang Township attacked our Huangxing Road line the night before last. Our army braved the rain to meet the attack. The sound of rifles and machine guns was incessant all night until dawn yesterday morning, when the enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: Military news: The enemy who attacked Liuhang along both sides of the highway from Yanghang on the 13th was completely repelled on the night of the 13th. There were no changes on the entire line on the 14th.

### Fierce Fighting Erupted at Yong'an Bridge as Enemy Troops Advanced on Yanghang

Our Army Wielded Broadswords, Annihilating Countless Enemies; More Than a Dozen Hand-to-Hand Combats, Enemy Suffered a Crushing Defeat and Retreat; Xinzhen Area Still Garrisoned by Our Army

According to official sources, Xinzhen, in the middle section from Yuepu to Luodian, is still in the hands of our army. The night before last (13th), enemy troops launched a fierce attack on the town from the riverbank. Enemy ships on the river also shelled it at the same time. Our army resisted heroically, using machine guns and small steel cannons to shoot. The two sides engaged in fierce combat. The enemy troops finally suffered a crushing defeat and retreated.

Yong'an Bridge, south of Xinzhen, was also subjected to fierce artillery fire the day before yesterday (13th). The place is four kilometers east of Liuhang, that is, the center point of Yanghang and Liuhang. The enemy troops advanced in two routes at that time, one route attacking the Dajiadian and Xinkaihe area north of the bridge, and the other route attacking the Beiyangzhai and Yunzaobang area south of the bridge. However, our army had already built solid defensive works in the area. When the enemy troops approached, our soldiers bravely took the lead, jumped out of the trenches, and engaged the enemy troops in hand-to-hand combat with broadswords, more than a dozen times, annihilating countless enemies. At present, our army is still firmly defending the original line of defense.

Central News Agency reported that in the Yanghang area, our army moved 2,000 meters west to the north bank of a small river. The Yong'an Bridge connects the two banks. Solid fortifications have now been built. When the enemy troops advanced to Yanghang Town on the 12th, they were intercepted by us many times and suffered heavy damage. Therefore, after reinforcements were added, they began to advance the night before last. Our side received the replenishment of the main force, with strong strength, and was waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Then the enemy swarmed in, and we immediately intercepted them head-on, throwing machine guns and hand grenades at the enemy陣. The enemy suffered a major blow and immediately divided their troops to the left and right. We also came out of the trenches to respond. At that time, the battle line extended to 4,000 meters. The enemy and our side each exerted their utmost strength to fight each other. When the blades met, our army waved broadswords, horizontally and vertically through the enemy陣, invincible. After advancing and retreating more than a dozen times like this, until the first light of dawn yesterday morning, the enemy finally suffered a crushing defeat and retreated, and we are still firmly defending our original position. In this battle, the enemy took the offensive, so they suffered more casualties.

### Our Army Bombed Enemy Headquarters

Our army in the city center area, due to strategic considerations, is stationed on a new line of defense, but the line from North Station to Baziqiao remains unshaken, forming a mutually supportive posture with the Patriotic Girls' School, closely monitoring the enemy troops at the Naval Landing Force Headquarters. Yesterday, from morning to noon, our army in the Qingyun Road Baziqiao area fiercely bombarded the Beisichuan Road area. At the same time, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of pearls. The Japanese Naval Landing Force Headquarters and the area near the Japanese Elementary School on Beisichuan Road were hit by more than twenty rounds of our artillery, and the enemy suffered heavy damage. Several other rounds landed about 400 yards south of the enemy headquarters.

### Heavy Fighting on Xiangyin Road Yesterday Morning

Although the enemy troops have advanced to Yinxiang Township and the city center area, our army in the Yinxiang Township area is now retreating to the area west of Ningguo Road, Huangxing Road. From about 6:00 PM the night before last to dawn yesterday morning, there was fierce rifle and machine gun fighting there. Yesterday morning, enemy ships in the Huangpu River occasionally fired their guns, the purpose of which was also to target the positions of our army in the area, in order to assist their infantry's attack. However, our army worked hard to resist and vowed not to retreat. The enemy troops suffered quite a few casualties, but they did not succeed in the end.

After the enemy troops advanced to the city center area, yesterday morning they used twenty-three armored vehicles and tanks, accompanied by about 300 infantry and cavalry each, to advance south along the Songhu Highway, attempting to threaten the garrison in the Yinxiang District in the northern part of our special zone. Our army withdrew from the Jungong Road area, step by step, operating in an orderly manner. In the Huangxing Road area, there were already strong strongholds. At that time, we immediately met the attack along Huangxing Road, and a battle was encountered to prevent them from going south. Our army fought bravely, advancing without retreating. The enemy suffered a major blow and then confronted us by relying on Xiangyin Road.

### Situation Suddenly Tense in Pudong

In recent days, the situation in Pudong has suddenly become tense. The enemy's intention to land has changed from passive to active. From 6:00 AM to noon yesterday, enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River continued to shell our Pudong area intermittently, intending to cover the landing. However, because our army was closely guarded, there was no action. At about 4:00 PM, enemy Destroyer No. 6 sailed from Yangshupu to the Lujiazui river center of the Waibaidu Bridge and dropped anchor, with its bow facing the Chunjiang Wharf. At the same time, a Japanese small landing craft, which seemed to have been waiting there for a long time, carrying more than thirty enemy troops, quickly sailed towards the Jiang Wharf, intending to try to land. Just as it was about to dock and land, our garrison had already seen it and began to sweep with machine guns when it was about to stop. Many Japanese soldiers were injured on the spot. The No. 6 Japanese destroyer, anchored outside the wharf, was originally carrying a large number of soldiers who intended to cover the landing, but it was ineffective in opening fire, and hurriedly used heavy machine guns to fire randomly at our army on the wharf. For a time, bullets flew, and sparks shot around. The pedestrians on the Bund fled in droves. The coolies at each wharf also stopped working and temporarily avoided stray bullets. It stopped after about half an hour. The white landing craft fled Chunjiang Wharf at that time and sailed downstream. The No. 6 destroyer, seeing that we were prepared, also raised anchor and sailed east, to the east of the Izumo ship in front of the Gonghexin Wharf, and dropped anchor on the No. 3 river tube. Until the evening, the enemy ships shelled our Pudong area again, and our words immediately returned fire with heavy artillery. The mutual bombardment stopped after about half an hour. Later, at about 7:00 PM, the enemy troops used machine guns to sweep across the river near the Japanese Consulate General, but it was just to vent their anger and wasted bullets. At the same time, there were also three or four speedboats, fully loaded with enemy troops, cruising on the river surface near the Bund Park, seemingly with the intention of landing in Pudong again. However, our guard is strictly guarded. If the enemy comes to犯, they will definitely be severely damaged.

### Enemy Bombs Pudong Alcohol Factory

From 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, enemy planes three times gathered a small team and flew to Bailianjing, Pudong, to bomb the alcohol factory. They dropped thirteen bombs before and after, but most of them fell in the fields. Although the alcohol factory was slightly damaged, many nearby houses were destroyed. Yesterday morning, after crossing the river to investigate, there were more than twenty injured and five dead on the spot, all of whom were villagers in the neighborhood. It was found that the alcohol factory had long been closed, and a British flag was hung on its roof. At the same time, there were the American Da Lai Steamship Company and the British Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory nearby. Most of the factories in the area were the property of foreigners, but the Japanese planes did not hesitate to bomb them, which proves that they did not care about public law. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, another enemy plane flew low over Nanshi along the Rihui Port area for reconnaissance, intermittently sweeping with machine guns. Before long, it flew to Pudong again.

Enemy planes were still active in all directions yesterday. At about 5:00 PM, they dropped bombs in Pudong, attempting to destroy our artillery positions in order to lift the threat to the enemy troops in the Yangshupu area. However, according to the report from the garrison in Pudong, the enemy dropped bombs aimlessly, so our positions were not damaged.

Enemy planes harass the rear in the Nanshi Pudong area every day, and the people suffer a lot. Yesterday morning, enemy planes flew to Nanshi for reconnaissance again, and used machine guns to扫射 when they saw pedestrians. From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, two enemy planes flew to the Nanhuangpu area of Pudong again for reconnaissance and扫射, and then flew to the Nanshi city area again,扫射 downward with machine guns. The residents in the city, who originally regarded the city center as a safe place, are now frightened three times a day. The enemy is angry and takes the massacre of civilians as their only skill, so from yesterday onwards, they have fled in droves, and only one or two out of ten people remain.

At about 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM yesterday, three enemy planes circled and reconnoitered in the Zhaobei area of Huxi Zhongshan Road and Jishifei Road浜, and扫射ed with machine guns, injuring an old woman. Two bombs were also dropped near Dachang by enemy planes, with very little damage. Also, from 11:00 AM to noon, enemy planes flew to Zhabei to bomb, and the Zhabei Power Distribution Company on Liuying Road was bombed and destroyed.

### Enemy Reinforcements Arrived Again, More Than Two Thousand People

Yesterday afternoon, another enemy cruiser, the Takenoura, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau Middle Pier. More than 2,000 enemy troops landed to reinforce the enemy troops in the Hongkou area.

According to people from Yangshupu, from 6:00 AM yesterday, Japanese military transport trucks in the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts were fully loaded with armed Japanese soldiers and transported heavy military supplies, rushing back and forth, heading to Hongkou Park and Yinxiang Township, very busy. Seeing this, the enemy army seems to be reorganizing the military in that area.

At dawn yesterday, an enemy transport ship arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Road Mitsubishi Wharf, unloading a large number of burlap bags and defensive materials. It is said that the ship loaded the corpses of enemy soldiers and sailed back to Japan that evening.

### Enemy Transported Two More Ships of Munitions

The enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, Tianjin Maru, Dairong Maru, Tottori Maru, Kinu Gasa Maru, and Dongtai Maru, that sailed to Shanghai the day before yesterday, except for the latter two, which had finished unloading the munitions and sailed out yesterday, the cargo of the remaining one had not been completely unloaded as of yesterday afternoon. And at 7:01 AM and 1:30 PM yesterday, the enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships No. 166 Unkai Maru and No. 89 Beifun Maru continued to sail to Shanghai, docking at the Huangpu and China Merchants Bureau Zhao piers, respectively. In addition to a large number of heavy weapons, such as armored vehicles, armored cars, tanks, etc., unloaded, there were also a large number of black large cars and more than a thousand barrels of gasoline, which were transported and landed. At present, the depots at each pier are stocked with enemy munitions and military supplies, with the Osaka and Huangpu piers having the most, but their important items are all stored in the China Merchants Bureau Middle and North piers.

### General Situation of Enemy Troops Along the River

Since our army retreated to the first line of defense the day before yesterday for strategic reasons, this reporter went to the river to observe in person from 8:00 AM yesterday in order to understand the situation of the enemy troops along the river. The following is a summary of what I saw. The reporter set off from the Bund on a轮 yesterday morning. When the 轮 sailed past Lujiazui, I saw five enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships moored at the China Merchants Bureau Middle, North, Osaka, and Huangpu piers, unloading military supplies, very busy. The 轮 gradually sailed outward, seeing a fierce fire burning near the end of Yangshupu Road, Lan Road. Further ahead, I saw three big fires in the city center, burning so fiercely that it was rare before. The city's major buildings may have been reduced to ashes. Near the water plant, there were more than twenty enemy war horses, hauling field guns and heavy cannons, and three trucks carrying eighty or ninety enemy troops following behind, slowly driving towards the city center area of Jungong Road. An armored vehicle was also parked on Jungong Road, and the Jungong Road Bridge had been blown up. Further ahead to Zhang Huabang, I saw more than a dozen enemy trucks parked there, more than 300 war horses, and more than 300 army soldiers. To Yunzaobang, there were more than 500 enemy army soldiers, more than 100 war horses, and to Wusong Town, near the customs branch office there, there were four carriages for enemy拖 cannons. There were also more than 200 enemy army soldiers in Wusong Town. About 100 trucks were parked in the Wusongkou customs branch office area, and presumably a large number of enemy reinforcements had arrived. These trucks were to be used to transport the enemy troops to the front after landing. In total, there were many thatched sheds built from the Qujiang Wharf to the Wusongkou, and the scattered enemy troops along the river used these thatched sheds as their resting places. The above is the general situation of the reporter's inspection of the沿 River yesterday.

### Investigation of Enemy Ships Moved Yesterday

According to the results of the reporter's investigation at the river at 4:00 PM yesterday, the large base camp where the enemy ships sailing to Shanghai gathered can be divided into four, namely ① Wusongkou, ② Liuhuo, ③ Qujiang Wharf, ④ Pudong. A total of forty-nine enemy ships were anchored in the Wusongkou area, a total of twenty-six ships near the Qujiang Wharf, and a total of twenty-one ships in the Pudong River. Based on this estimate, the enemy ships anchored in the Liuhuo area should be around forty. The following is an investigation of the mooring situation of enemy ships in the Songkou and Qujiang Wharf area and in the Pudong River. (A) Wusongkou area, a total of five cruisers outside Songkou, fifteen transport ships, five gunboats, two destroyers, eleven ships from Wusongkou to Shizilin, one destroyer at the Wusongkou Customs Branch, the first, third, fifth, second, seventh, ninth No. eight hundred and three of Wusong Town. Ships such as two, one, eight, and five and two, two, one, and nine were transport ships (the names of the remaining three ships are unknown), and a gunboat on the River near Tongji University, a total of forty-nine ships (B) Qujiang Wharf area, a total of one gunboat each for No. 21 and No. 23 of the Jungong Road Water Plant, one gunboat opposite Gaogiao, two enemy ships No. 23 opposite Qujiang Wharf, sixteen enemy ships at Qujiang Wharf, one cruiser at the south head of Qujiang Wharf, one No. 21 destroyer, one No. 21 gunboat, one No. 23 destroyer opposite the fish market, and one No. 6 cruiser (already sailing outward) at the power plant, a total of twenty-six ships, (C) Pudong River, one gunboat each for No. 41, No. 36, No. 22, No. 16, No. 15, No. 14, and No. 11 floating docks, one destroyer each for No. 9, No. 8, No. 7, No. 6, No. 5, and No. 1 floating docks, one No. 2 floating dock Izumo flagship, one No. 11 destroyer at Mitsubishi Wharf, one cruiser at China Merchants Middle Pier, two enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships at China Merchants North Pier, one transport ship at Osaka Wharf, and two transport ships at Huangpu Wharf, a total of twenty-one ships. In total, from Shizilin outside Wusongkou to Pudong, there are a total of ninety-six enemy ships anchored.

### All Parties in Britain Express Sympathy for Our Army's Retreat in Shanghai

Admiring the Brave Resistance of Our Soldiers

Central News Agency, London, 14th Reuters: All parties express sympathy upon hearing of the retreat of Chinese troops from the Shanghai area, and "unanimously express admiration for the Chinese troops' brave resistance with flesh and blood against the Japanese army's steel for five weeks." Furthermore, the British newspapers all disclosed the news about China in a prominent position, which shows the concern of the general public. The reports of the special reporters of the newspapers vividly depict the situation, which makes the readers increase their admiration for the bravery of the Chinese soldiers. Among the newspapers, the Daily Leader is the most outstanding, because the newspaper publishes Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek's telegram every day. This kind of war report is a good model for news reporting, and it is rich in news value, so it has aroused unanimous praise from the London newspaper area. Military observers here highly praised the Chinese army's retreat as rational, and regarded the Japanese army's re-stepping on the same path as the January 28th Incident as strange, because five years ago, the Japanese army invaded a place with no military value, which was not worth the loss, and today they are making the same mistake again. Furthermore, it can be clearly pointed out that when US policy is controlled by isolationist peace elements, the great powers have no intention of intervening. Opinions in official circles feel that it is still difficult to guess the outcome of the incident and the true content of Japan's objectives for the time being. Perhaps there is no clear overview in Tokyo either. However, the observation of the general public believes that North China is the main focus of Japan's intention, which is also the focus of Japan's objective. The Manchester Guardian said that after two months of the Sino-Japanese War, it can now be concluded that Japan's main effort will be in North China and not in Shanghai. Regardless of whether Japan can make China kneel down, it is still difficult to forget the possibility of war with the Soviet Union. Therefore, what Japan desperately hopes for is to insert a wedge between China and the Soviet Union and establish a defensive line in the northwest of China.

The report said that it is an undeniable fact that the Japanese army has won a great victory in North China, but the Japanese army has not yet defeated the main force of the Chinese army, and must deal with the famous Red Army, which is now preparing to harass the Japanese army. In addition, the land occupied by the Japanese army must also defend against guerrillas to ensure its safety. The guerrillas have proven to be a formidable enemy in "Manchukuo". The Morning Post published an editorial written by a special visitor who recently returned from North China, saying that the Japanese army has a wide range of operations, long transportation lines, and is always in danger of being destroyed by the enemy. The conditions of the plains and mountains give the Chinese army great convenience for guerrilla warfare. The Chinese army is good at this tactic. Although the Chinese army cannot drive out the Japanese army, it has the power to harass it and consume its fighting power. The real decisive battle will be in the winter months, when there will be approximately 350,000 Japanese troops on all fronts. Maintaining such a large army in a foreign war zone is as large as Europe, and the Japanese army cannot withstand the cold, which is all to the disadvantage of the Japanese army. The ability of China to support itself in terms of military supplies is now considered by all parties to be a key issue in the situation. Therefore, it is difficult to get support for the formal actual combat required by the Chinese newspapers, because after the declaration of war, China has very few obvious interests, and will automatically give Japan the right to inspect ships. As far as the current situation is concerned, Japan seems to be unwilling to interfere with foreign shipping beyond confirming nationality.

### Enemy Troops Advance to Sijing Ball Field

Fierce Fighting in the Municipal Cemetery Area Yesterday; We Strictly Guard Our New Position, the Enemy Collapsed in One Battle

Our army in the city center area has now moved back to the Songhu Road to Gaojingmiao Wanguo Recreation Ground Racecourse area. The enemy troops are now based in the Lujiajiao to Sijing Ball Field area east of the Yejia Garden behind the Municipal Government. The two armies had fierce battles there the night before last.

At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy in the Sijing Ball Field area launched a fierce attack on our army's position at the Jiangwan Racecourse on Songhu Road. Our army's defense there was solid. After being severely attacked by us, the enemy suffered considerable losses. There was also artillery fire near the Zhabei Water Tower.

Our army in Jiangwan has built solid defensive works on the new position. At 5:30 yesterday morning, our artillery bombarded the Japanese Headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. The bombardment was fierce and did not stop until noon. The enemy suffered heavy damage. At the same time, a regiment of enemy troops near Gaojingmiao also advanced on our position. After the defending troops came out of the trenches to meet the attack, they came into contact with the enemy in front of the Municipal Cemetery and collapsed in one battle. We did not pursue and strictly guarded the new line of defense. According to a military officer, this kind of contact is probing in nature. The main battle within days must be in the Gaojingmiao Jiangwan area. We have deployed heavy troops and are prepared to inflict a blow on the enemy.

### Wuhan Camp Honors the Officers and Soldiers Who Died in Baoshan

Central News Agency, Hankou, 13th: Wuhan Camp, because Xia Shi Yao Camp, was trapped in Baoshan, and all of them were loyal to the end. Their loyalty will forever glorify the mountains and rivers.

[Guangzhou] Chen Ce, commander of the Humen Fortress, spoke to a Central News Agency reporter by telephone on the morning of the 14th after repelling the enemy warships, saying that the enemy shells all landed outside the fortress, which shows that the enemy warships' combat power is weak, and they were instead hit by our artillery fire. The reporter told him that Tokyo Radio broadcast on the evening of the 13th that Japanese planes had completely destroyed Humen that day, and asked if this was true. Commander Chen said that there were no traces of enemy planes on the 13th. The enemy warships attacked on the morning of the 14th and fled in less than an hour, which is sufficient to prove the absurdity of the Japanese broadcast propaganda. He wondered how Tokyo Radio would justify itself in the evening broadcast. (Central News Agency, 14th)

[Guangzhou] Enemy warships attacked Humen on the 14th and were repelled by our defending troops, who returned fire, heavily damaging one ship and lightly damaging another. Seeing that they could not withstand the attack, the enemy fled in a panic. According to aviation sources, the heavily damaged enemy warship sank completely near Chiwan. (Central News Agency, 14th)

### Movement to Guarantee Families of Soldiers Resisting the Enemy

[Nanjing] In light of the heavy casualties among soldiers at the front and the lack of assistance for their families, and in order to supplement the government's insufficient ability to provide relief, Wang Fusheng, an expert in national defense economics, has initiated the "Movement to Guarantee the Families of Soldiers Resisting the Enemy." His method is good and his intentions are noble, and it can serve as a reference for the people across the country to implement. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently visited Wang at his residence, and he told us about the origins and main points of the plan for initiating this movement. We are now disclosing it as follows: A. Origins: This time, the Chinese nation's war of resistance against the enemy is tragic and unprecedented. For example, Luo Fangzhuo's entire regiment of officers and soldiers died heroically at Nankou, and Yao Ziqing's entire battalion of officers and soldiers died heroically at Shi Shan. Their loyalty to the country and their willingness to die are truly moving to both heaven and earth. The people living in the rear, if they think of the heavy sacrifices made by the soldiers at the front, ask yourselves, what else can you cherish, what else is worth cherishing? In order to fulfill a little bit of the responsibility of us who have not died, we should at least share a little of the family responsibilities of the soldiers at the front who are protecting the lives and property of the entire nation and who are wounded or killed in action, and take care of their families so that we can comfort the spirits of the dead soldiers and inspire the will of the living soldiers. On the one hand, it is also enough to fulfill the responsibility and duty of the people in the rear. This is the reason why I initiated the Movement to Guarantee the Families of Soldiers Resisting the Enemy. B. Main Points of the Plan: 1. All national people's organizations should jointly organize a Committee to Guarantee the Families of Soldiers Resisting the Enemy, with a general office in Nanjing and branch offices in each province. 2. The general office should request a roster of officers and soldiers from each army and division participating in the war of resistance from the supreme military authority, and distribute the lists to each province and city according to the distance and proximity of each officer's and soldier's place of origin, so that the people in each place can separately assume the responsibility of guaranteeing the family of a certain officer or soldier. 3. All social organizations, foundations, or individuals with property or productive capacity must independently identify or be assigned by local organizations to assume the guarantee of one or more officer and soldier families. 4. When an officer or soldier whose family is guaranteed dies or is disabled in action against the enemy, the family should be paid a monthly or annual or one-time maintenance allowance, the amount of which should be determined based on the economic situation of the guarantor and the person being guaranteed. 5. The officer or soldier being guaranteed should be limited to those whose families have no brothers or property and who leave behind parents who are unable to work, as well as widows and orphans. 6. The contract between the guarantor and the person being guaranteed should have legal effect. This is only an outline, and detailed measures must be formulated separately. (Central News Agency, 14th)

This law will take effect on the 14th. (14th Special Dispatch)

### The Japanese's Vicious Treatment of Traitors

[Nanjing] Enemy planes have been attacking for days, and traitors are active everywhere. The military police have repeatedly captured them and executed them by firing squad, which has pleased the people. However, these traitors are also pitiful. A certain intelligence officer told reporters that all traitors do not know who their leader is. It is said that there is also a layer of middle-level traitors, who are called "Japanese life traffickers" internally. All tasks such as hiring small traitors, managing them, and eliminating them are handled by the life traffickers. For example, if a certain person, A, is in charge of gathering ten small traitors, then the work and location of these ten people during enemy air raids will be arranged by A. When distributing money, A will transfer it. If each person can get ten yuan, A will deduct at least five yuan. When the situation is settled, A must also be responsible for cleaning up the lives of these ten people, either by poisoning or assassination. If one slips through the net, A himself will be in danger of his life, because he fears that they will leak information or be arrested and implicated, and that they will extort him endlessly, so he must kill them all to silence them. For example, in a certain area after a certain battle, many headless corpses were found. Most of the killed were coolies. The police could not find any clues for a while, and only later did they discover that they were all killed by the life traffickers and small traitors to silence them. Their methods can be said to be vicious. (Central News Agency)

### League of Nations General Assembly Passes Agenda

[Geneva] The 18th regular session of the League of Nations General Assembly continued this afternoon at 5:30 PM. The representatives of each country unanimously elected the chief representative of India, the Islamic leader Aga Khan, as the chairman of the General Assembly. After taking the chair, Aga Khan expressed his gratitude to the representatives of each country and gave a speech stating, "The need for international cooperation is even greater now than in the past. The West is under a storm, and so is the East. The principles of peace that we represent in the League of Nations have been severely hit. However, the League of Nations has achieved remarkable results in the past year, especially in the re-establishment of defense of the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits and the settlement of the Turkish minority issue in the Sanjak region of Syria, which we must not forget." Regarding Egypt's accession to the League of Nations as a member state, "From the standpoint of a Muslim, I deeply feel that the universality of the League of Nations is far from what it used to be." I hope that it will be able to overcome the most serious difficulties at present. The General Assembly then passed the agenda and appointed various committees, with the following candidates for chairmen: 1. Chairman of the Jurisprudence and Regulations Committee: Greek representative, the country's ambassador to France, Politis. 2.

### Chilean Representative Submits Proposal

Advocating Amendment of the Covenant to Universalize the League of Nations

[Geneva] The League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting at 10:35 this morning. The Chilean representative, Eduardo, chairman of the Covenant Amendment Committee, proposed seeking ways to universalize the League of Nations to enhance its strength. Eduardo stated, "Various technical and health-related organizations affiliated with the League have been quite effective, precisely because these organizations are universal, with all nations participating. Therefore, the League of Nations should amend the Covenant articles to allow non-member states to join, opening the doors of the League, so that all non-member states may join. The time is now ripe. We should invite non-member states to express their opinions on both the amendment of the Covenant and the work of the League." (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas dispatch)

### Executive Yuan Re-elects Three Council Members

Turkey Contesting for a Semi-Permanent Council Seat

[Geneva] The terms of the three non-permanent council members of the League of Nations Executive Yuan, Chile, Turkey, and Spain, are expiring this year. The voices for Chile and Spain are the loudest. Regarding the seat vacated by Turkey, it is reported that Iran has already submitted its candidacy and is supported by Turkey. As for the seat vacated by Spain, the country has decided to seek re-election. League of Nations figures believe that the key to whether Spain can be re-elected lies in the countries of South America and Turkey. This is because the South American countries are eager to repatriate the refugees of Madrid in their respective countries, which largely depends on the Spanish Republican government facilitating this matter. Only then can the South American countries support Spain's re-election. In addition, Turkey is also said to be intending to seek re-election. If so, the chances of Spain being elected will inevitably be diminished. However, as far as is generally known, the Turkish government has not yet decided its attitude on this matter. (Central News Agency, 13th, Geneva dispatch)

### British Newspaper Comments on Our Appeal to the League of Nations

[London] The Daily Telegraph commented today on China's application to the League of Nations, saying that anyone who knows the truth of the world's current situation would not believe that the League of Nations could provide China with peace through collective action. We believe that even the applicant itself does not expect such a result. In fact, China's application is not only to the League of Nations but also to a major power that has never been a member of the League, namely the United States. The purpose of China's move is to sway world public opinion. Although the League of Nations, in its current structure, cannot be an executive force, it is still a tool for determining factors in international events and providing countries with an opportunity for fair adjudication. It would be shortsighted if the League of Nations were to disregard this value. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters dispatch)

### The Failure of a Quick Victory Strategy: Japan's Economic Crisis

Daily Military Expenditure Requires 20 Million; Prolonged War Will Inevitably Lead to Collapse

—Observations from the Soviet Union's Pravda—

[Moscow] Pravda published an article discussing the current situation in Japan, stating, "The Japanese warlords are currently in a difficult situation. The war against China has just begun, and Japanese imperialism has already encountered many difficulties both at the front and at home. The Japanese warlords had guaranteed their government and bourgeoisie that the war would end quickly and bring certain benefits, prompting them to support the military. However, the result has been to trap Japan in a long-term war. The Japanese commanders' strategic plan, which originally assumed that China would quickly succumb, has completely failed, ultimately leading Japan to spend increasingly more on military expenditures. According to calculations by its allies, the German fascist newspapers, who are paying close attention and cannot help but be alarmed, Japan's military expenditure in China has already reached 20 to 25 million yen per day, and by the end of this year, it should continue to increase fourfold or fivefold. At the same time, according to observations from Japanese domestic newspapers, the national budget for the next year will reach 5 billion yen, of which 3 billion will be military expenditure. This prospect has already caused complaints from the bourgeoisie. In short, the war against China has further exacerbated Japan's already overstretched economic structure. This is now completely clear. Many textile factories have gone bankrupt, and the market price of Japanese securities on the London Stock Exchange has fallen by 15 percent. The result of ordering large quantities of military supplies from abroad has led to a sharp outflow of gold. Each week that the war is prolonged, the domestic ruling camp becomes more panicked, and the illusory 'unity' constructed by the Konoe cabinet is also increasingly in danger of complete collapse."

### Alumni Association of Students Returned from Japan's Statement to Japanese Cultural Circles

Prevent Military Junta's Atrocities, Safeguard East Asian Peace

The Alumni Association of Students Returned from Japan, in view of the violent destruction of our cultural institutions by the brutal Japanese, disregarding humanitarian justice, and despising world public opinion, issued a statement to Japanese cultural circles yesterday, urging Japanese insightful and perceptive cultural figures to prevent the atrocities of the military junta and continue to safeguard East Asian peace. The original text is recorded below for the attention of various imperial universities, official and private universities, the Japan-China Society, the East Asia Common Culture Association, various news agencies, and cultural groups:

We, the Chinese nation, have cherished peace for thousands of years. The people of China and Japan initially had no deep-seated grudges or accumulated grievances. However, since the September 18th Incident, your military has repeatedly invaded our territory, damaged our sovereignty, slaughtered our innocent people, and destroyed our cultural institutions. Domestically, you control public opinion and oppress the people. Externally, you disregard public law and ignore good faith, sacrificing the lives of millions of soldiers as a tool for a few to gain promotions and seek titles. Those who are knowledgeable regret this. However, the young officers, instead of reflecting on themselves, have intensified their actions, provoking the Lugou Bridge Incident, invading North China, plotting to break into our Hongqiao Airport, increasing troops in Shanghai, forcibly conscripting reservists, and drastically increasing military budgets, leading to exorbitant taxes and soaring prices, disregarding the lives of the people at home, and attempting to make a desperate gamble to achieve their wild ambitions. Who would have thought that our entire country, compelled by national crisis, would unite in sincerity and courage, and that our loyal soldiers would forget their own lives and serve the country. Wherever the righteous army went, your troops were awestruck and fearful, their morale depressed, with casualties filling the roads, blood staining the banks of the Huangpu River, and corpses piling up in the fields of North China. The essence of your country has now become resentful spirits in a foreign land. Who caused this? Who is truly responsible? Your military's prestige has plummeted, and their madness has intensified. They disregard humanitarian justice, bombing our innocent refugees and destroying our North and South Universities, causing the hatred between the people of China and Japan to deepen. They seize the property of neutral countries and injure the envoys of neutral countries, causing an uproar in world public opinion, with disdain and hatred for them. The independence movement in Korea is flourishing, and the national revolution in Taiwan is intensifying. It is seen that your Japanese empire will become the enemy of all nations and will ultimately be unable to avoid the fate of demise. Therefore, we sincerely advise you, the cultural figures, who are the vanguard of society, to urgently take effective measures to curb the atrocities of the military junta, so that East Asian peace and the life of your country can be continuously preserved.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Offers Free Cholera Vaccinations

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, in view of the recent epidemic, in addition to regularly dispatching vehicles to various parts of the Settlement to administer cholera vaccinations, has also established a vaccination center at 340 Hankou Road (i.e., the Health Department branch office) for the convenience of workers and the general public in the central district.

Employers who wish to have their workers vaccinated as a group should notify the Health Department of the details by telephone or in writing (telephone 12410).

### English-Language Shanghai Evening Post Comments on Our Military's Strategic Retreat

Believes Action Taken According to Prearranged Plan; Zhabei and Pudong Positions Remain as Strong as Ever

The brutal Japanese, since launching their war of aggression in Shanghai, have been met with the blood and flesh of our loyal soldiers, who have been engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy's artillery fire for over a month, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Now, for strategic reasons, we have retreated to the first line of defense, holding firm positions, determined to wage a long-term resistance. Final victory will surely belong to us. The local English-language Shanghai Evening Post has made several comments on our military's planned retreat, which are translated below:

The Chinese troops, who yesterday (the 13th) carried out a planned retreat of about sixty to seventy kilometers to the strong defense line from Liuhe to the North Railway Station, are confident that they can prevent the enemy's advance. This arc-shaped new defense line began to be built after the outbreak of the Shanghai war. The Chinese military authorities had predetermined that they would inflict a heavy blow on the enemy when they landed and then retreat to hold this defense line firmly. Foreign military observers here believe that the Chinese army's retreat to the first line of defense is a planned strategic action, and they believe that this retreat should have been carried out last week. The reason why the Chinese army delayed is to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy and prevent them from establishing contact in various places along the river. After the Chinese army retreated, there was actually no change in the battle situation last night. The Japanese army is obviously acting cautiously and dare not go deep into the positions left by the Chinese army because of the danger of accidentally triggering landmines planted by the Chinese army. As for the Chinese army in Zhabei, there is no intention to withdraw. The positions there are as strong as ever. The Chinese army in Pudong is holding firm to its strong defense line. The Japanese army has repeatedly scouted the Chinese artillery positions there in the past few weeks and bombed them, but they have not hit anything and have gained nothing.

### Two Principles of Protracted Warfare

— Hua

Yesterday and the day before, our army made slight adjustments to its two positions in Yangxing and the city center of Jiangwan. These two positions were originally located in protruding parts of our main battle line, facing the enemy's fierce attacks and incurring significant attrition. However, this attrition was not absolutely necessary. Therefore, after the complete construction and consolidation of our first line of defense, our forward troops at these two locations each retreated five kilometers, removing the protruding sections and making the main defense line from Liuhe through Luodian, Liuhang, Dachang, Jiangwan, to Baziqiao a straight line. This shift in the adjusted positions was very calm and orderly. The enemy, intimidated by the remaining might of our army's heroic resistance over the past month and wary of the landmines planted by our army, did not dare to advance rashly. Our army, after being redeployed along the new defense line, immediately secured its position, inflicting fierce setbacks on the enemy's risky advances.

This rearrangement of the adjusted positions is considered very appropriate by many foreign military experts and causes us no losses. However, the enemy and the traitors they use have taken this opportunity to spread rumors, deceiving some people who lack military knowledge. This situation should be closely monitored and prevented during our resistance war. Therefore, we should briefly explain the two most basic principles of protracted warfare here so that the general public can have a clearer understanding of the significance of our recent strategic measures.

At present, our resistance against Japanese imperialism is a protracted war. We are not afraid of the expansion of the battle lines. We are not afraid of the increase in enemy troops. The basic reason is that the more dispersed the battle lines, the greater the enemy's attrition, which is more favorable to our protracted warfare. Under this plan of protracted warfare, we have adopted two principles: First, the gain or loss of one or two positions is not important in our overall plan of resistance because we will continue the resistance permanently until the enemy is exhausted and swept away from our land. Second, although we do not overemphasize the gain or loss of one or two positions, we must still make the enemy pay the greatest price for every inch of our territory they want to take.

The above two principles have been fully demonstrated in the Songhu resistance war over the past month. The enemy has reinforced three times, mobilizing six divisions and concentrating more than a hundred warships, yet they have only managed to gain a strip of land more than ten kilometers along our riverbank. The enemy's attack on Baoshan resulted in the loss of more than two regiments. The enemy's rush from Qiujiang Wharf into the city center the other day also triggered our army's landmines. For more than a week, the enemy has sacrificed greatly to seize Jungong Road to achieve contact between Yangshupu and Wusong. As of now, the losses the enemy has suffered in Shanghai are at least 20,000 or more, and the consumption of artillery shells and other military supplies has become an immeasurably large sum. In this situation, it is sufficient to prove that our protracted resistance has achieved great success.

When fighting on the riverbank, the enemy's warships and artillery can still recklessly display their blind bombardment. However, after our battle lines shift inland, the navy will have no use. In the land battle, our army will use solid positions and brave soldiers to make the enemy's blind and chaotic charges repeatedly suffer the fiercest counterattacks. We can be sure that in this situation of protracted warfare, the "clay-footed" Japanese imperialism will eventually be buried in the tomb of its own aggressive policy.

⊙ Brest, France Three destroyers belonging to the French Atlantic Fleet, namely the "Audacieux," "Épervier," and "Intrépide," as well as six torpedo boats, have been ordered to prepare to sail to the Mediterranean to perform surveillance missions to prevent piracy. Two other torpedo boats have already sailed to the waters off northwestern Spain. (Central News Agency, 13th, Havas dispatch)

[London] The European situation was quite tense last week, but it has greatly eased due to the results of the Nyon Conference. British and French diplomats have handed over the documents of the Nyon Agreement to Rome and Berlin, respectively. Those familiar with the matter observe that submarine attacks in the Mediterranean should be prevented thereafter. (13th, National Telegraph)

⊙ Nyon, Switzerland The international agreement to prevent piracy in the Mediterranean was formally signed here today. French Foreign Minister Delbos and British Foreign Secretary Eden traveled here together by car from Geneva in the morning. After getting out of the car, they immediately held a closed-door meeting. Despite the heavy rain, the conference hall was decorated with flowers, and reporters and photographers from various countries were crowded. Delbos presided over the meeting and initially signed the agreement on behalf of France. The United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia then signed in order according to the first letter of their country names.

Full Text of the Agreement

"Recently, merchant ships of various countries have been repeatedly attacked in the Mediterranean, and the attackers are not from either side of the Spanish Civil War. Therefore, the countries signing the Nyon Agreement have decided to order their respective naval fleets to take action to protect any merchant ships sailing in the Mediterranean that do not belong to either side of the Spanish Civil War. Any submarine that violates international regulations and attacks merchant ships should be retaliated against and, if possible, sunk. The signatory countries have decided to divide the Mediterranean by day into the following areas, each responsible for protection: ㊀ The western Mediterranean, including the British island of Malta, is to be monitored by the British and French naval fleets in both the high seas and territorial waters, but the Tyrrhenian Sea is not included in this area, and the monitoring measures will be decided separately later. ㊁ The eastern region, from Malta to the Suez Canal, is to be monitored by each country's own naval fleet in its own territorial waters, and by the British and French fleets in the high seas, except for the Adriatic Sea. The signatory countries have agreed to use submarines to ensure the safety of merchant ships, but the submarines must travel on the surface and must be close to the ships they are escorting, and their actions must be notified to all signatory countries at any time. In addition, no foreign submarines may enter the territorial waters of other countries. The signatory countries also recommend that their respective merchant ships should travel along the main Mediterranean routes jointly decided in advance."

This treaty, in addition to being signed by nine countries including Britain, France, and Russia, also allows any country to join by signing.

### Representatives of Various Countries Deliver Speeches

After the signing, French Foreign Minister Delbos delivered a speech, pointing out the importance of the Nyon Agreement, saying that this agreement is sufficient to solve the problem of piracy in the Mediterranean. "Moreover, at this Mediterranean conference, the representatives of various countries all held good intentions, so the agreement could be quickly established. From now on, life in the Mediterranean will be protected, the safety of navigation will be guaranteed, and international morality will be maintained. This is what I dare to deeply congratulate the representatives of all countries present. As for various forms of aggression other than submarines, they should not be ignored and should be discussed at this session of the League of Nations Assembly. At the same time, the effective measures recommended at the Nyon Conference should be implemented immediately." Delbos added that Italy was originally invited to participate in the conference, and he hoped that it would accept joint cooperation in the future. In conclusion, he said, "The result of the Mediterranean conference is sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the principle of collective security and is a model of international solidarity."

Then, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov delivered a speech, briefly stating that the Soviet delegation was deeply satisfied with the rapid establishment of the Nyon Agreement for the Mediterranean conference, but it was a pity that the protection of ships in the Mediterranean did not include ships belonging to the Spanish Republican government. He went on to say that the Nyon Agreement is the realization of the ideals of collective security and regional agreement, and that all countries participating in the Nyon Conference belong to the peace front. The Yugoslav representative also delivered a speech, expressing congratulations on the signing of the agreement. Finally, British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech, congratulating Delbos for his guidance in this conference and thanking the representatives of the participating countries, saying that the work of the representatives was very beneficial and hoping that the agreement would be approved by the whole world and that the countries concerned would also be able to ratify it. At 1:05 PM, the Mediterranean Conference was declared closed, and the representatives of various countries returned to Geneva by car (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas dispatch).

### Italian Government Drafts Reply

Rumored to Propose Reservations

[Rome] The Italian government's reply to the invitation to participate in the Nyon Agreement will be issued tonight. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters dispatch)

[Geneva] Italian sources claimed today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has accepted the Nyon Agreement, but with "certain reservations." It is understood that Mussolini has agreed to the general provisions of the agreement. The so-called "reservations" are probably because Mussolini is dissatisfied with the scope of Italy's patrol in the Mediterranean, finding it too small. French sources said that Italy wants to be on an equal footing with Britain and France, while British observers said that Mussolini only wants to slightly expand the scope of Italy's patrol. (13th, National Telegraph)

[Rome] According to well-informed sources here, the Italian authorities are extremely disgusted with the Nyon Agreement. Responsible persons also said that Britain and France are responsible for monitoring the entire Mediterranean, while Italy is only given a secondary position and is ordered to monitor a part of the Mediterranean, that is, the area designated by it (from the port of Genoa to Sardinia), which Italy cannot accept. Moreover, the agreement established by the Mediterranean Conference was published first, and Italy was notified later, which is also enough to make Italy feel unhappy. The Italian government is now exchanging views with the German authorities and will conduct talks with the British government before taking a final decision. In addition, Italian political figures have not commented much on Germany's non-participation in the Mediterranean monitoring program, but they believe that the Soviet Union's non-participation in the Mediterranean monitoring is a matter of course.

### Nazi Party Congress Ends; Hitler Delivers Closing Address

Spare No Effort to Criticize Communism; Does Not Want to Be Isolated Economically

⊙ Nuremberg Hitler attended the closing ceremony of the Nazi Party's annual congress last night and delivered a long speech lasting two and a half hours. The contents included ㊀ calling on countries around the world to jointly prevent the spread of the Red Peril and listing the dangers of the Communists' communization of the world, ㊁ explaining that Germany is grateful for the guarantee of its strong military forces and takes a calm attitude towards the international situation, and ㊂ pointing out that the Spanish civil war is also an example of Moscow's world revolution. It is a complete distortion of the facts to regard the Bolsheviks as legal and the national army as rebels because the struggle of the national army is like the struggle of Fascist Italy. Its purpose is to seek Western politics to be governed by Westerners and not to allow any international center to control it. Finally, Hitler solemnly declared that Germany refuses to join hands politically with the Bolsheviks who are destroying Europe. Economically, the figures for foreign trade can prove that Germany is by no means seeking economic isolation. Hitler asked, "We all have a great hope, that is, peace can be achieved, and the great cause of the country must be achieved over time." (14th, Haitong Telegraph)

### Mussolini's Planned Trip to Germany

[Rome] The proposal for Prime Minister Mussolini to visit Germany in return has been rumored for a long time. The itinerary has now been announced.

Then, he will take the route through the city of Munich to Berlin, stay for two days, and then go to Mecklenburg and Pomerania provinces to visit the large-scale exercises of the army, navy, and air force. On the way back, he will still take the route through the town of Berchtesgaden for a short stay. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas dispatch)

### Death of Tomáš Masaryk, Founding Father of Czechoslovakia

From Apprentice Ironmonger to Father of the Nation: His Achievements Rival Those of Washington

⊙Prague, Czechoslovakia – Tomáš Masaryk, the founding father of Czechoslovakia and former President, had been ill since the [blank] day of this month, and his condition quickly deteriorated into pneumonia. Despite the best efforts of numerous doctors, he succumbed to old age and weakness, passing away at 3:30 this morning. The news of his death has plunged the nation into mourning. President Beneš and Prime Minister Hodža are attending to the funeral arrangements at the villa. Masaryk's wife, son, and daughter are also by his side. Crowds stand in silence before his residence, paying their respects. Many women are seen weeping, demonstrating the profound impact Masaryk had on the people. A summary of Masaryk's life and achievements is as follows:

Tomáš Masaryk was one of the great leaders of the post-World War I world. Throughout his life, he created the Czechoslovak Republic, and his accomplishments can be compared to those of George Washington. As a statesman and philosopher, his writings are abundant and his knowledge profound, rarely matched in his time. He was 87 years old. Born in the town of Hodonín (Göding) in the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, his father was a Slovak serf who was later freed and worked as a coachman and foreman for the imperial court. After graduating from elementary school, Masaryk went to Vienna as an apprentice ironmonger. However, dissatisfied with his circumstances, he returned to his hometown. With the help of a good teacher, he entered Brno High School. After graduating, he entered the University of Vienna, specializing in philosophy. In 1876, at the University of Leipzig in Germany, he met Charlotte Garrigue, an American woman. They fell in love and married in 1878, traveling to the United States together. The following year, he returned to the University of Vienna as a lecturer and earned a doctorate. In 1882, he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Prague, where he formed a group with many liberal scholars and politicians, with Masaryk as their core. From 1886 onwards, he promoted the spirit of science, opposed metaphysics, organized the Realist Party, and founded the newspaper *Čas* as a tool for propaganda. In 1891, he was elected as a member of parliament, but due to disagreements with other party members on strategy and personnel matters, he resigned in 1893. From that year onwards, Masaryk devoted himself to scientific research on the one hand and public education on the other, working diligently and conscientiously without interruption for ten years. At that time, young people in various universities had launched a nationalist movement, centered on Masaryk. In 1900, he organized the People's Party, and in 1907, he was re-elected as a member of parliament, advocating democracy in every way. When World War I broke out, he dedicated himself entirely to the Czech revolutionary movement. In early 1914, he published his masterpiece, *Russia and Europe*. After the book was published, it was banned by the Russian imperial government. In September of that year, he secretly went to the Netherlands to meet with British friends, reporting on the situation in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the Allied powers. He then traveled to Italy and formally established relations with the Allied governments. However, due to the intense pursuit by the domestic authorities, he knew he could not return home and decided to organize a revolutionary movement abroad. In 1915, he organized the Czech National Council abroad, which was later renamed the Czechoslovak National Council. The current President of Czechoslovakia, Edvard Beneš, was also a key leader of the council. In February 1916, he went to France and met with the late French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand, continuing to report on the internal situation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the Allied powers and organizing Czech troops to join the Allied forces in the war. Due to these efforts, the late U.S. President Woodrow Wilson issued a declaration on January 10, 1917, stating that the liberation of the Czech nation was one of the war aims of the Allied powers. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he traveled to St. Petersburg and organized Czech troops on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately, the Russian army was defeated, and Masaryk ordered these troops to withdraw through Siberia to Vladivostok. Subsequently, the Allied powers arranged for them to be transported back home by sea. In March 1918, he crossed the United States again and signed the Pittsburgh Agreement, deciding that the Czech and Slovak nations should unite to form an independent state. On October 18 of the same year, in the name of the National Council, he formally announced the overthrow of the Habsburg dynasty and organized a provisional government, with himself as provisional president and holding the positions of prime minister and finance minister. After the success of the revolution in 1918, he returned home and was elected as the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic by the National Assembly, and was repeatedly re-elected until December 14, 1935, when he retired due to his age of [blank] years, and was succeeded by the Foreign Minister, Edvard Beneš, his early revolutionary comrade. From that time on, he retired to the countryside, enjoying his later years until now. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Soviet Union Sends Another Note to Japan Demanding Closure of Two Consulates

Japanese Consuls in Novosibirsk and Vladivostok Not Allowed to Exercise Their Functions from Today

[Moscow] The Soviet government has consistently applied the principle of equal numbers of consulates on both sides. It has now informed the Japanese government that, from September 15th of this year, the Soviet Union will not recognize the right of Japanese consuls in Novosibirsk and Vladivostok to exercise their functions. The Soviet Union sent a note to Japan on May 11th of this year, stating that there were eight Japanese consulates in the Soviet Union, while there were only six Soviet consulates in Japan. Therefore, Japan was requested to close the aforementioned two Japanese consulates. According to the exchange of notes between the two sides in 1926, the number of consulates on both sides should be equal. Furthermore, there are no Japanese residents in the above two places except for the employees of the consulates, and there is no need for consular protection. Japan disputed this note. Therefore, the Soviet Union notified Japan today that it would no longer recognize the Japanese consuls in these two places from tomorrow. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Commander Yang Sends Representatives to Visit the Authorities of the Two Concessions

Expresses the Shared Interest in Investigating and Arresting Traitors; Hopes That the Concession Authorities Will Offer Full Sympathy and Assistance

According to the Central News Agency, in order to ensure local security, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters is seriously investigating and arresting traitors. To ensure effective progress, Commander Yang has expressed his deep hope that the authorities of the two concessions will offer deep sympathy and practical assistance. Yesterday, Commander Yang specially sent representatives to visit the police authorities of the two concessions to discuss all matters. According to a spokesperson for the Garrison Headquarters, it is the Headquarters' duty to make efforts to investigate and arrest traitors in order to eliminate the source of chaos in the Shanghai area and to ensure local security. This is the same as the efforts of the concession authorities to protect the security of the concessions. The Headquarters has no objection to the various measures taken by the concession authorities for the purpose of protecting security. The concession authorities should naturally sympathize with the various measures taken by the Headquarters to investigate and arrest traitors. Furthermore, the conspiracies, organizations, plans, and actions of traitors, whether latent or discovered, are all in the concession areas in cases of major importance, and their impact on security in the concession areas is no less than, or may be even greater than, their impact on security in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Headquarters. This should not be ignored by the concession authorities in their efforts to protect the security of the concessions. All traitorous organizations and activities in the area should be severely cracked down upon and punished in order to achieve the goal of concession security. The Headquarters also believes that if the concession authorities truly want to ensure the security of the concessions, they must punish traitors to achieve their goal, as the disruptive actions of traitors are the real and actual threat to the security of the concessions, while other factors are not worth worrying about. Therefore, the Headquarters believes that the concession authorities should assist the Headquarters in investigating and arresting traitors. This is not only in accordance with the various good relations in the history of both sides, but also in the interest of ensuring the security of the concessions themselves. The concession authorities assisting the Headquarters in investigating and arresting traitors is tantamount to the concessions eliminating the source of chaos for themselves. In other words, the Headquarters investigating and arresting traitors in the concession areas is tantamount to assisting the concessions in eliminating the source of chaos. The concession authorities should naturally sympathize with this. The concession authorities should not consider the obvious dangerous organizations and activities of traitors, which are enough to endanger the security of the concessions, to be insignificant and ignore them. This intention was previously expressed to the reporters of the *North-China Daily News* and the *Shanghai Evening Post*, and the Shanghai newspapers reported on it. Now, based on the original intention, it is further extended, and it is still hoped that the concession authorities will base their actions on the various good relations in history and the shared interest in local security, and offer full sympathy and assistance to the Headquarters in investigating and arresting traitors in the concessions. In particular, in the case of the traitor Li Aidong recently handled by the Headquarters, the Public Concession Police have already provided assistance in accordance with the law, jointly escorting him to the competent court, and the court has ruled for extradition. After the ruling, the police representative did not raise any objection and accepted the judgment in court. It is hoped that the police will comply with the court's ruling and promptly hand him over to the Headquarters for transfer in accordance with the law, in order to complete the procedure for the concession authorities to assist in this case. This is a sincere hope.

### Maritime Workers' Union Sends Telegram of Respect to Chiang Kai-shek

And Sends Telegrams of Condolence to the Soldiers on the Front Lines

Mr. Yang Hu, the special envoy of the Chinese Maritime Workers' Union, has been urging his subordinates to work tirelessly since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai. In addition to actively coordinating all rear affairs, he also sent two telegrams of condolence, one to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and one to the soldiers on the front lines. The texts of the telegrams are as follows: ㊀ To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission in Nanjing: The violence of the Japanese invaders has increased without end. They have seized Tianjin and Peking, invaded Shanghai, bombed our cities, killed our refugees, destroyed cultural institutions, blockaded coastal ports, obliterated justice, and isolated themselves from the world. We rely on your leadership to launch a full-scale war of resistance, to strike at the violent, and to crush the strong enemy wherever the flags point. Final victory will surely belong to us. In addition to exhausting the strength of our entire maritime workforce and using various methods to assist in the war of resistance, we respectfully send our condolences. We ask for your consideration. ㊁ To the soldiers on the front lines of the Pinghan, Jinpu, Pingsui, and Shanghai lines: The ambition of the Japanese invaders has not diminished, and pressure has been applied horizontally. Relying on their strong armor and weapons, they are attacking our various regions. We rely on your soldiers to fight bloody battles, to advance without hesitation, to sacrifice their lives for righteousness, to kill the enemy and achieve results, and to frequently report victories. We are filled with admiration. The revival of the Chinese nation is due to the merits of your war of resistance. Since the first blow has already been struck, final victory will not be difficult for us to achieve. We respectfully send our condolences. We ask for your consideration.

### Cholera Outbreak in the Two Concessions

As of the day before yesterday (the 13th), the number of cholera cases in Shanghai, according to the second report from the Health Department of the French Municipal Council and the Health Department of the Public Concession, has reached 529, of which 450 are in the French Concession and 79 are in the Public Concession. Compared with the previously reported 235 cases, the percentage has increased to over 100%. It is reported that the majority are still refugees. One Russian foreigner has also been infected, and one has died.

### Three Focal Points for Relief Supplies

Light Biscuits, Cotton Clothing, and Medicine: We Hope That All Sectors Will Donate Quickly

According to a conversation with the person in charge of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, in the future, citizens should concentrate their donations of relief supplies on the following three types to meet urgent needs: ㊀ Foodstuffs: Soldiers on the front lines are easily spotted by enemy aircraft when they light fires to cook during the day, and often a meal is destroyed by enemy artillery as soon as it is heated up. Therefore, it is very difficult for soldiers on the front lines to solve the problem of food. In view of this, the Association has specially asked experts to improve and manufacture "light biscuits." Each one costs 1.4 cents. These "light biscuits" are the same dry rations used by Qi Jiguang to suppress Japanese pirates in the past. After being improved, they are nutritious, can withstand hunger for a long time, and are easy to carry. They are indeed a more satisfactory food for soldiers fighting these days. Also, it is difficult for soldiers on the front lines to disinfect drinking water. A chemist has now invented a kind of drinking water disinfectant tablet. Placing one tablet in a pot of cold water is enough to disinfect it, so there is no need to boil it before drinking. Each yuan can buy 1,000 tablets. ㊁ Clothing: The weather is already turning cool in autumn, and soldiers on the front lines urgently need cotton vests. We hope that all sectors will enthusiastically manufacture and donate them. The dimensions can be inquired about at the Cotton Clothing Guild in Zhoujinli. Also, the previous appeal to all sectors to donate 10,000 cotton quilts is still far from being met. We urgently hope that all sectors will donate them quickly. ㊂ Medicines: In addition to soliciting donations from overseas Chinese, we hope that the citizens of this city will also donate more of various medicines needed by soldiers. For the above items, if you would like to donate money, please hand it over to the Shanghai Relief Committee for the Collection of Donations and Materials. (See today's newspaper advertisements for details. The association is the agent.)

### National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee Establishes National Salvation Savings

Collections Will Be Made at Various Bond Payment Collection Agencies Starting Today; A National Salvation Savings Account Can Be Opened with One Yuan or More

The National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee Headquarters has established "National Salvation Savings" in order to encourage citizens to accumulate financial resources over the long term and broadly purchase national salvation bonds. Collections will begin today (the 15th) at various national salvation bond payment collection agencies. The details are as follows:

The Meaning of Savings

The publicity department of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee issued the original text of "The Meaning of National Salvation Savings" as follows: Now our committee has created a kind of "National Salvation Savings." The regulations have been formulated and entrusted to the various collection agencies for national salvation bond payments. The method is as follows: anyone who can take out one dollar can open a savings account with the collection agency and receive a savings booklet. Afterwards, they can continue to save and record it in the booklet at any time, regardless of the amount, until the day the national salvation bond issuance ends. At that time, a settlement will be made, and the Ministry of Finance will issue national salvation bonds of the same amount to the original collection agency for distribution to the individual savers. If the settlement amount is less than five yuan, or less than five yuan with a remainder, the saver can pay the difference or combine several savings accounts to make up the amount to exchange for a bond and clear the booklet. As for the interest on this savings, it is specified as a weekly rate of 4%, similar to the interest on ordinary savings deposits, and the timing and method of paying interest in the future will be exactly the same as for national salvation bonds. The national salvation savings booklet has the same effect as the receipt for the national salvation bond payment. National salvation savings also have an advantage, which is their continuity. Even if someone can immediately take out five yuan for several months, perhaps they would like to buy more gradually. They can also use the savings method to save the country over the long term. Those who are willing to donate a percentage of their salary each month may sometimes have a remainder. Using the savings method can avoid the hassle of finding and paying each time. The meaning of saving the country over the long term is extremely important. To be honest, the country needs our long-term efforts to be saved. Therefore, we must not underestimate national salvation savings. It will exert a great force in the future.

Savings Regulations

The National Salvation Savings Regulations, Article 1: The National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee has established national salvation savings in order to encourage citizens to accumulate financial resources over the long term and broadly purchase national salvation bonds, and will collect them in accordance with these regulations. Article 2: All national salvation bond payment collection agencies entrusted by the committee may act as national salvation savings collection agencies. Article 3: Anyone who can save and pay one yuan or more in legal currency may open a national salvation savings account with the collection agency, receive a savings booklet, and then continue to save at any time, regardless of the amount, and record it in the booklet until the date when the issuance of national salvation bonds ends, at which time a settlement will be made. Article 4: The interest on savings is calculated at a weekly rate of 4%. The timing and method of paying interest are in accordance with the regulations for national salvation bonds. Article 5: After the settlement of these savings, all multiples of five yuan or more will be given national salvation bonds of the same amount by the Ministry of Finance, which will be distributed to the individual savers by the original collection agency. If the settlement amount is less than five yuan, the saver may pay the difference in cash, or several accounts may be combined to make up the amount to exchange for a bond and clear the booklet. Article 6: This savings booklet has the same effect as the receipt for national salvation bonds.

Collection Agencies

The National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee has entrusted the main and branch offices of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, and the main and branch offices of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, as well as its designated first- and second-class post offices, as collection agencies for national salvation savings, and has entrusted their headquarters as the general collection agency.

### Ardent Enthusiasm, Reducing Food and Donating Money

Those Who Live in Luxury and Fine Food: What Do They Feel When They Hear This?

Being in Prison, the Heart is in the Country

All the prisoners in the Second Special District Prison of this city, in view of the fact that the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai has lasted for more than [blank] months, are also very enthusiastic. In addition to donating more than 110 yuan in relief money before, they recently continued to reduce their food for 16 days, raising a total of more than 350 yuan in national currency, which was submitted by the warden and sent to the All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association for use as relief money to send to the front lines as a consolation. I wonder what the feelings of those who live in luxury and fine food are when they hear this?

Christians Pray for Blessings

All the Christians in this city, because the compatriots in the war zone are displaced and in dire straits, have decided to fast for one meal at noon on the 18th of this month (Saturday), and all the meal fees will be used to relieve the refugees. At that time, all the churches in the city will ring their bells to gather all the Christians in the city to hold a prayer at the Moore Memorial Church, to bless the Republic of China, and the Christian Association will notify the churches in various places to hold fasting prayers at the same time.

### Traitors in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai Conceal Themselves

The Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai areas used to be centers for traitorous activities. Since the Garrison Headquarters strictly arrested and executed them according to law, the traitors have greatly concealed themselves. The Garrison Headquarters has also dispatched patrol teams in the above-mentioned areas from yesterday to completely eliminate the traitors.

### Curfew in the Western Hongkou Area at 6 PM

Merchants and Residents Should Pay Attention

The curfew time in the Public Concession and the French Concession of this city was originally set to start at 10 PM every day. However, because it was felt to be inconvenient, both concessions changed it to start at 11:30 PM every day. However, the western Hongkou area north of the Suzhou Creek is close to the front lines and in a dangerous position, so the curfew is enforced from 6 PM every day, which is different from the curfew time in the Public Concession and the French Concession south of the Suzhou Creek. Merchants and residents in all sectors should pay attention.

### Tongji University Relocates to Zhejiang for Classes

After the destruction of its campus in Wusong, the National Tongji University actively began efforts to resume classes and prepared for classes at 29 Difeng Road in Shanghai. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation in Shanghai and the dispersal of students in all directions, they were unable to come to Shanghai for studies. Moreover, due to the language barrier (the university uses German as the foreign language), it was not feasible to borrow classrooms from other schools. As the cultivation of practical talents is extremely important during the national resistance against Japan, the university president, Dr. Weng Zhilong, personally went to various locations in Zhejiang to seek a convenient and conducive location to hold classes. It is reported that Dr. Weng has now found a temporary campus in Jinhua County and will be relocating there in the coming days. Classes are expected to begin there within the next month. The plan to open classes in Shanghai has been cancelled. The university has also sent notices to students in various locations, informing them to gather in Jinhua in early October.

### Enemy Plans to Peek into Liuhang from Xinzhen, Shelling Heard, Attempt on Shui'an Bridge Failed

Shelling Shakes Distant Areas, Our Positions Remain Undamaged - Enemy Repeatedly Harasses Jiangwan and Zhabei, All Repelled - Enemy Attempts to Land in Pudong, We Remain on High Alert

The focus of the war is currently centered on the areas east of Luodian, west of Xinzhen, and north of Liuhang. The line from Xinzhen to Yong'an Bridge is particularly targeted by artillery fire. The Luodian and Liuhe areas remain relatively quiet. Xinzhen is located between Yuepu and Luodian. Our troops have established a strong defense at Gujiage, west of Xinzhen. Yong'an Bridge is south of Xinzhen, serving as the central point between Yanghang and Liuhang. The enemy's plan is to infiltrate south from Xinzhen, converge with the enemy in Yanghang, and advance on Liuhang and Miaohang in multiple directions, attempting to cut off our military's communications. At dawn yesterday, a brigade of enemy troops advanced along Xiaojinzhaizi, west of Xinzhen, towards Dongzhixiang and Xizhixiang. Our loyal and brave soldiers, firmly defending the Gujiage area, rose up to fight the enemy. Intense fighting continued until late at night, resulting in heavy enemy casualties, forcing them to retreat. Simultaneously, another group of enemy troops harassed our positions west of Gujiage and at Shulibao and Wudoujing, east of Luodian. After several hours of bloody fighting, the enemy forces collapsed. We seized the opportunity to pursue and captured a significant amount of enemy supplies. This morning, the enemy again shelled our Yong'an Bridge with heavy artillery. The deafening sounds shook distant areas, but our positions suffered no damage. Currently, our troops are firmly defending the defensive fortifications from Yong'an Bridge northwards to Gujiage. The fortifications are exceptionally strong, and any enemy advance will be met with a head-on assault. In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, the enemy repeatedly sent small units to attack our positions at Huangxing Road, Baziqiao, Baoshan Road, and other locations. Intense gunfire and artillery exchanges occurred throughout the night. We calmly responded and held our original positions. After 8:00 AM this morning, apart from continuous enemy reconnaissance flights and sporadic gunfire, there was no intense fighting.

### Bloody Battle at Yong'an Bridge All Day

Our Troops Fiercely Attack the Enemy in the Middle Road at Xin Kaihe - Heavy Casualties Among Enemy Troops in Xiaojinzhaizi Area

After our troops firmly defended the first line of defense, the tense situation around Luodian gradually increased. At dawn yesterday, a large force of enemy troops, covered by more than ten enemy aircraft, attacked our troops east of Luodian. Intense fighting broke out under the concentrated fire of both sides. The battles between Gujiage and Yong'an Bridge, and along the Shulibao and Wudoujing lines, were exceptionally fierce, continuing in a bloody battle throughout the day. The enemy at Xinzhen launched a fierce attack on our forward positions at Xiaojinzhaizi, Xizhixiang, Dongzhixiang, and other locations. Our troops bravely fought back, showing no fear. Despite the enemy's artillery fire and tank charges, they resolutely held their ground. Fighting continued incessantly from morning to noon. Our troops at Lujiazai and Xinkaihe simultaneously advanced, fiercely attacking the enemy in the middle road. The enemy troops in the Xiaojinzhaizi and Dongzhixiang areas suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive was halted in that area, preventing them from advancing further. By evening, the intense fighting had subsided slightly. Our troops continued to firmly defend the positions from Yong'an Bridge to Gujiage. The fortifications on Yong'an Bridge are exceptionally strong. Any enemy advance will be a self-inflicted trap.

The Shen Shi News Agency reported that at approximately 8:00 AM this morning, enemy troops near Yong'an Bridge, west of Yanghang and between Liuhe, again attacked our alert line positions. Our troops bravely came out to meet them, and a fierce battle ensued. We bombarded the enemy with concentrated artillery fire, simultaneously covering our soldiers' bayonet charge. The enemy also resisted stubbornly. Fighting continued until noon.

### Enemy and Our Troops Confront Each Other at Jiangwan

There were only minor skirmishes yesterday afternoon, with artillery and rifle exchanges. A major battle is expected soon.

### Fierce Fighting at Baziqiao Last Night

Our Troops Leapt Out of Trenches Shouting Battle Cries - Enemy Soldiers, Fearing Hand-to-Hand Combat, Retreated

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) A gentleman who participated in the battle at Baziqiao in Zhabei told us that at 7:30 PM last night, as darkness fell, the sound of gunfire was heard in the vicinity of Tiantong'an. Initially, it was sparse but grew denser and denser, indicating that the enemy troops had come to harass us again. About half an hour later, the gunfire suddenly stopped about 400-500 meters away from our positions. According to reports from the outposts, the enemy was probing our alert line and taking a flanking attack formation from the left and right wings, with no more than a hundred men. We had long known the enemy's strategy and feigned indifference. Another half hour passed, and the enemy indiscriminately fired machine guns, launching a fierce offensive. At that moment, a certain battalion commander of ours gave a shout, and everyone fixed bayonets, preparing for battle, and returned fire with machine guns. The two sides began a fierce battle that lasted for a long time. Our troops leapt out of the trenches, preparing to charge. As the battle cries rose, the enemy scattered and retreated. The enemy's fear is hand-to-hand combat. Attacking the enemy's weaknesses with our strengths is our effective strategy for driving away the enemy. By 9:30 PM, the enemy had disappeared. An inspection within the alert line revealed more than twenty enemy corpses and several military supplies. We suffered only five or six casualties.

### Enemy Repeatedly Attacks Tiantong'an

Several Waves of Harassment All Failed

A small group of enemy troops rushed out from Dithmarschen Road towards Qimei Road, while another small group rushed out from East Sports Road, advanced to Jiangwan Road, and attempted to attack the right flank of our Huangxing Road positions. They were met with a head-on assault by our troops. Nineteen of the enemy who rushed out were sacrificed under our machine guns and grenades, leaving corpses scattered everywhere. The remaining enemy retreated to their original positions. Our troops suffered no losses.

Another group of enemy troops rushed out from behind the Liusan Garden in Tiantong'an and charged out from Guangzhong Road, attacking our positions at the Water and Electricity Road, Guangdong Middle School, and other locations. The enemy and our troops engaged in a fierce battle for control of the area yesterday afternoon. Fighting continued near the school last night. Guangdong Middle School remains in our hands. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses in this battle, with deaths and injuries estimated to be in the thousands.

The enemy fired artillery at our shore, and the enemy soldiers were extremely fierce. In view of the enemy warships lurking outside the port, our Lianyungang coastal defense authorities have specifically blockaded the port entrance, prohibiting all Chinese and foreign ships from entering or leaving. This port is a seaport built by our country itself and is not restricted by any treaties.

Our Front Reaches North of Yao Guanzhun - Enemy Attacks Xingji in Stalemate - Railway Bridge Over Machang Canal Destroyed by Us - Our Troops Launch Fierce Attack on the Right Flank of the Enemy in Pinghan

[Jinan] Over a thousand enemies have reached Xingji. Our front is north of Yao Guanzhun, the left flank is in Shijialou, and the right flank is in Xiuli Village. We are preparing for a general offensive (Special dispatch, 14th).

[Jinan] This morning, our troops searched and advanced on the front lines, without encountering the enemy. They have reached 18 li north of Yao Guanzhun Station.

### Anti-War Movement Active in Japan

Workers Burn Oil Refineries and Explosives Factories - Incident of Army Officers Spreading Rumors Occurs

[Hong Kong] According to a foreigner who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Japan, although the Japanese government has been using various false propaganda to anesthetize its people since the start of the war against China, those with a bit of reason all know it is wrong. In particular, the lower classes who bear the heaviest burden of the war are expressing their opposition to the war in various ways. For example, seamen in Kobe, dissatisfied with overtime and reduced pay, planned a strike a few days ago, but it was discovered by the police and the leaders were arrested. Also, the Marushin Oil Refinery near Niigata Prefecture was suddenly set on fire by workers on the 2nd of this month, destroying ninety crude oil and gasoline tanks. All workshops, laboratories, distillation equipment, and offices were burned to the ground, resulting in a loss of one million yuan. This incident was publicly reported in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 3rd of this month. Most notably, the so-called "incident of lower-ranking army officers spreading rumors" recently occurred in Ginza, Tokyo. The case is still under strict investigation. As for the explosion at the Kyoto Uji Explosives Factory earlier this month, the investigation has reportedly revealed that it was also committed by workers in the factory. In short, judging from the activities of the oppressed classes in Japan, the anti-war movement in that country is currently on the rise (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th).

### League of Nations Administrative Council Prepares to Discuss

Our Country's Application

[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council has agreed to include China's application on the agenda of the current session of the Administrative Council. This decision was made after the Administrative Council held a closed meeting. It is reported that Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, will deliver a speech to the League of Nations General Assembly today (Reuters dispatch, 15th, Central News Agency).

⊙Ottawa The National Executive Committee of the Canadian Co-operative Social Association today issued a statement stating that Canada's economy is now rapidly becoming part of the Japanese war machine. Canada should immediately implement the Neutrality Act in the Sino-Japanese War, and that Canada's trade with Japan has greatly increased compared to a year ago. The Japanese warlords are now increasingly dependent on Canada for military supplies. The Canadian government should prohibit the shipment of war supplies to Japan (Reuters, 14th, Central News Agency).

### US Prohibits Ships from Carrying Munitions

To China and Japan

[Washington] After consulting with Secretary of State Hull and others, President Roosevelt issued a statement stating, "From this day forward, all ships owned by the United States government are prohibited from loading various munitions and military supplies, as specified in the list I issued on May 1 of this year, destined for China and Japan, pending further orders. Other ships flying the American flag that transport the aforementioned munitions and military supplies to those countries will also bear all risks themselves before the government issues new orders" (Havas dispatch, 14th, Central News Agency).

[Washington] President Roosevelt issued an article today after meeting with Secretary of State Hull and others, stating that the new warnings issued by the authorities regarding shipping do not indicate that the government intends to invoke the Neutrality Act. The government's policy regarding the invocation of the Neutrality Act remains based on the twenty-four-hour basis. The US President also stated that all arms, ammunition, and other military supplies must be issued export licenses. Once the Neutrality Act is implemented, these exports must be stopped (Reuters dispatch, 14th, Central News Agency).

### Trivial Commentary

— On Representatives

It is said that the Japanese Diet has publicly nominated twelve representatives who arrived in Shanghai the other day to offer comfort to the invading soldiers on the front lines. Furthermore, it is said that in addition to offering comfort, they also have the mission of investigating the actual situation of the war. This is indeed the expression that the eight million or so citizens, who are concerned about the national situation, should have. I have heard that Japanese domestic newspapers are proclaiming that on one front they have advanced to such-and-such province, and on another front they have advanced to such-and-such city. Now that you gentlemen have personally experienced the situation and observed the traces of war, you can only boast of the supreme achievement of our army's initial voluntary retreat from the city center, and you cannot but feel a great disappointment. If you gentlemen have some spare time, our country will sincerely invite you to visit Sincere Company, the South Railway Station, Songjiang Railway Station, and Beixinjing, etc., to witness the heroic miracles of your soldiers. It is thought that this trip will leave you with a deep and honorable impression. You will faithfully report to the people of your country.

### Yesterday, the China International Problems Research Association of the League of Nations Exposed the Atrocities of the Japanese Army

The China International Problems Research Association, led by its honorary director Yan Huiqing, and in the names of all directors including Li Zhaohuan, Liu Zhanen, Qian Yongming, Xu Xinliu, Dong Xianguang, Xu Shuxi, He Dekui, and Dai Zhiqian, sent a telegram to the League of Nations General Assembly exposing the atrocities of the Japanese army. The original telegram is translated below: Since China has had its culture, it has embraced the ideal of world peace. After Japan occupied Manchuria and other places in 1931, China's clear hope of peaceful coexistence with its neighbors has not wavered. In the past six years, China has tried to reach a peaceful solution to the disputes with Japan and fundamentally adjust the relations between the two countries. However, the Japanese warlords have continued to pursue their plan to invade and occupy Chinese territory without scruples. Now, a large part of North China, including Beijing and Tianjin, has been occupied by Japanese forces. Moreover, Japan has expanded its military aggression to Shanghai and its surrounding areas, causing a serious threat to China's national survival. In order to defend its territorial integrity and political independence, the Chinese government and people have no other way to follow except to rise up and resist at the cost of great sacrifice. Japan's military actions not only endanger the stability of East Asia, but also affect all other countries in the world. Therefore, we apply to the participating member states to immediately adopt the most effective measures in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant to limit Japan's aggression, so that the collective security system in the Far East can be preserved, and world peace can be maintained.

### The Relief Committee Released the Details of the Enemy's Bombing of Refugee Ships Yesterday

More than 400 People Were Killed and Wounded in the Bombing; Refugees Who Escaped Were Forced Back by Enemy Aircraft

The Shanghai Relief Committee released the details yesterday of the enemy's bombing of our refugee ships in Beixinjing. On the 13th of this month, the Gongxin Wheel sent nine civilian ships towed to Jiaxing, and the Xiemao Wheel sent twelve civilian ships towed to Suzhou, carrying a total of 2,189 refugees. Security guards Zhang Qingzhou and Wang Wenqing, and escorts Jin Dongting and Cheng Xiwu were sent along to take care of them. At 4:30 in the afternoon, when they were sailing on the Yujidun River in Beixinjing, two enemy planes suddenly flew low to偵察, circling for several weeks, and dropped heavy bombs. The first bomb hit the first tugboat of the Gongxin Wheel, which sank immediately. The second bomb hit the fourth and fifth tugboats of the Xiemao Wheel, which also sank. At that time, a total of more than 400 innocent refugees were killed and wounded in the bombing. After dropping the bombs, the enemy planes used machine guns to strafe the refugees who escaped, which was inhumane. Afterwards, the committee notified various charitable organizations to rush to rescue them, and sent the injured to Renji Hospital, the First Wounded Soldiers Hospital, the Seventh Rescue Team, and other places for treatment. The bodies of those killed in the bombing were taken care of by the burial team, the Red Cross, and the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. The refugees who escaped all walked to the area adjacent to the French Concession on Bailinan Road and slept in the open, and then encountered heavy rain, which was very miserable. At 9:00 yesterday morning, more cars were sent to load the refugees so that they could be sent back to their hometowns. At that time, enemy planes came to investigate again, causing the refugees who had boarded the cars to flee in panic. The committee has prepared food for the refugees to fill their stomachs, and at the same time is trying to send them back to their hometowns again. According to statistics, the committee has sent more than 60,000 refugees in succession.

In addition, according to a letter from the Finance Group of the Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association Relief Committee in Shanghai, our association and the Suzhou Red Cross jointly sent refugees back to their hometowns a total of seven times. On August 25, 350 people were sent; on the 26th, 110 people; on the 28th, 817 people; on the 29th, 600 people; on the 30th, 376 people; on September 1, 1,020 people; and on the 4th, 814 people, totaling 4,087 people. All arrived in Suzhou safely, and each time there were responsible persons and Boy Scouts to protect them along the way, with detailed reports. Moreover, the departure time was always at night, so it was relatively safe. The report that the refugee ship heading to Suzhou was bombed in Beixinjing was not sent by our association. It is hoped that the above situation will be announced to avoid misunderstandings.

### A Glimpse of the Tragic Scene of Corpses Left Behind After the Enemy's Bombing of Beixinjing

### Donate Clothes and Quilts to Refugees Quickly in the Cool Autumn Night

Charitable Organizations Urgently Request Donations of Cotton Clothes, Quilts, and Cash from All Sectors

The Shanghai Charity Relief Disaster Relief Association Refugee Relief Committee in War Zone, recently, in view of the cold weather, and that the more than 30,000 refugees it has taken in have mostly escaped alone, and that their clothing is mostly inadequate, at this time of cool autumn nights, if there are no clothes and quilts to keep out the cold, it is easy to cause disease to the wandering bodies. Once they are ill, their pain is even more unbearable. Although the association is actively purchasing clothes, how can hundreds and thousands of clothes be enough for more than 30,000 refugees? The difference is huge, and it is far from enough. At this time of financial constraints, there are still concerns about the food supply. Where can we get huge sums of money to purchase clothes and quilts? Therefore, we can only urge people from all walks of life to be compassionate and actively donate cotton-padded clothes, quilts, or cash, or widely solicit donations on behalf of others, so that tens of thousands of victims will not suffer from cold and hunger. In order to facilitate donations from all walks of life nearby, the association has designated the following five locations to collect clothes and quilts: ㊀ West District, Jueyuan Neijingye Society Shelter at the intersection of Avenue Road and Hardoon Road; ㊁ East District, Ball Field Shelter across from the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road; ㊂ South District, Zunsheng Shelter in the French Tibetan Temple on Jill Road; ㊃ Northwest District, the Taxation Shelter of the Second Taxation School on Kang Nao Tu Road; ㊄ Southwest District, Xuhui Shepherd Shelter in Xuhui Middle School, Xujiahui.

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War on August 13, refugees in the war zone have fled in a hurry, and their family property has been lost. At this time of cool autumn, food and clothing have become a problem. The refugee shelters of the International Relief Association are all built with sheds, which are colder than other shelters. The association has decided to rush to make 1,000 cotton quilts and 2,000 cotton clothes, but this is a drop in the bucket and far from enough. The association appeals to all sectors of society, and respectfully asks kind people from all walks of life to generously help with relief, no matter how big or small, new or old clothes or fabrics are, please send them to the association at No. 318, 3rd Floor, Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA.

The wartime service group of the Boy Scouts of this city, in order to collect winter clothes and help refugees, yesterday, led by the collection team leader Zhang Jiazhen, sent more than a dozen Girl Scouts to Jing'an Temple Road, Xieqiao Lane, Tongfuli and other places to solicit winter clothes. A total of 378 pieces of men's and women's clothing, 81 pairs of shoes, 3 bundles of socks, and 17 flower tires and quilts were donated. They will continue to set off to solicit donations today.

### The Atrocities of the Brutal Enemy Invading and Ravaging the Counties of Songhu and Baoshan

More Than 100,000 Refugees Will Suffer from Cold and Hunger; Forcing Our Strong Men to Charge into the Line of Fire

Since the Shanghai War broke out, the enemy has suffered losses in Hongkou and Yangshupu, so they expanded the war outwards. In Baoshan County, from Shizilin in the east to Yanglinkou in the west, there are enemy troops attempting to land. Afterwards, the enemy troops, with their sharp weapons, under the cover of heavy artillery and airplanes, fiercely attacked our army's positions, so that the entire territory of Baoshan, under the ravages of the brutal enemy, has almost no land for peaceful living. The fields are barren, and the residents are wandering in gullies. The tragedy is unspeakable. The situation is recorded as follows:

The Misery of Wandering is Unbearable to Witness

The total population of Baoshan is about 300,000. This time, they suddenly suffered the brutal enemy's invasion. The general residents took their old and young, enduring hunger and cold, and fled the war zone. The fellow villagers in Shanghai also rose up to organize refugee relief groups to rescue the refugees from danger in the war zone. Later, due to the fierce fighting and the expansion of the war zone, it became more difficult to provide relief. Relief vehicles could not enter, so the residents within the territory could only walk to the area in the northwest of Shanghai to be transported to Shanghai by relief groups. However, not a few people have been hit by stray bullets along the way, and it is unknown how many refugees have been killed by enemy planes indiscriminately bombing. At present, the county has rescued about 100,000 refugees, but with the limited capacity of the shelters in the city, it is even more difficult to arrange them. Moreover, the refugees have escaped, and all the necessary items cannot be taken out. As the weather becomes colder day by day, these more than 100,000 refugees will suffer from cold and hunger.

Fields and Agricultural Products Are Severely Ravaged

There is still a part of the residents who, because they are waiting for the autumn harvest, cannot bear to abandon their fields. Even under the intensive artillery fire, they still cultivate their fields. After the brutal enemy invades a village or town, they must carry out a search, and order the residents to stop all field work. Strong men are given Japanese clothes and forced to wear them to charge into the line of fire. The older ones are ordered to serve the enemy, and the old, weak, women, and children are thrown into the fire pit when the houses are set on fire. Their inhumanity has reached its extreme. According to statistics, the area's main income is cotton and rice. The grain could have been harvested this month, but unfortunately it was lost. This item alone is worth more than 6 million yuan, not to mention other items.

Traitors and Ronin Set Fires and Kill People

Almost all the cities and towns and villages under the jurisdiction of Baoshan have been set on fire and killed by the brutal enemy and the traitors and Ronin instigated by the brutal enemy. Broken walls and ruins, and corpses are everywhere, which is unbearable to witness. The true face of the brutal enemy's險狠 is fully exposed at this point.

### The Chinese Women's Comfort Association Announces the Amount of Donations

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Self-Defense and Resistance Against Japan has been working very hard. People from all walks of life have also been very active in donating money and goods. It is heard that the association has decided to publish the amount of donations, membership fees, goods, and all expenses in the Shen Bao on September 17 and in the Ta Kung Pao on September 18. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who donate money and goods will pay attention.

### The Chinese Medicine Community Relief Corps Hopes for Donations from All Sectors

Since its establishment, the battlefield rescue team of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Community Relief Corps has been setting off to the front line every day to work hard to rescue people, and has rescued no less than 400 wounded soldiers and refugees. The team is led by Captain Xu Wei, who is extremely brave and often performs rescues on the front line where bullets are raining down, which is highly praised by our military authorities. According to Captain Xu, the team's expenses are all donated by medical and pharmaceutical organizations, and no donations have been solicited from the outside world. The team has been extremely tight on budget. The war zone is expanding day by day, but there is only one truck, which is very difficult. Currently, the team members need trucks, medicines, gasoline, quilts, and other items, and deeply hope that kind people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate. If there are donations of the above items, they can be sent directly to the New China Medical College in Wangjiaku, Xiade Road, and transferred to the team.

Effective Hemostatic Recipe

At this extraordinary time, stray bullets are flying everywhere, and there are dangers lurking everywhere. However, the wounded often die due to excessive bleeding. Here is a good hemostatic recipe from Physician Gao Lishan, recorded below. Take one-quarter of white rattan, one-quarter of marine saltpeter (i.e., black fish bones), and grind them together into a powder. It is hoped that large and small pharmacies in the city will prepare more of this medicine, so that if they see compatriots who have been wounded, they can immediately apply this medicine urgently, and then send them to the hospital for treatment, so as not to die from their injuries.
