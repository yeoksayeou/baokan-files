Qian Dajun, Zhu Jiahua, Yan Youfu, Cheng Yuanfan, Wang Zheng, and others went to the city station to welcome them. A military band played music, and security inside and outside the station was strict. Han got off the train, shook hands and exchanged greetings with those who welcomed him, and then took a car to Youchang Villa on Qiantang Road to rest. At 10:15 a.m., he went to the headquarters at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to report on the military and political situation in Shandong Province and to seek instructions on everything. He had lunch at the headquarters. When reporters interviewed Han, he said that regarding smuggling in Shandong, the provincial government organized an anti-smuggling team to assist the customs in strictly suppressing smuggling. After confiscating smuggled goods several times, smuggling was eradicated as a result. As for Shandong's finances, the central government allocates 50,000 yuan each month from the salt tax surcharge. Revenue and expenditure can barely meet. This visit was to meet with Chairman Chiang to report on the military and political situation and to seek instructions on future administrative policies. After meeting with Chiang, he plans to stay for two or three days and then go to Shanghai to visit friends before heading north to Beijing and returning. The current situation in North China is stable. Although the Suiyuan incident has material assistance from other parties, it is not a major problem. Whether or not he will visit Zhang Xueliang in Fenghua is undecided. The rumor that he met with Chairman Song (Zheyuan) in Shandong is false.

### Wu Dingchang Flies to Chengdu

To Attend the Inauguration Ceremony of the Economic Branch, Inspects the Construction of the Province en Route

[Nanjing] Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, accompanied by Director of General Affairs Yan Shenyu, flew to Chengdu on the Shanghai-Chengdu airmail plane of China National Aviation Corporation on the morning of the 31st.

(31st Special Dispatch)

[Hankou] Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang flew from Beijing to Chengdu on the Chengdu aircraft at 10:20 a.m. on the 31st, passing through Hankou. When the plane arrived in Hankou, Mr. Wu got off the plane to rest for a while. According to Wu, who told reporters at the airport, the Sichuan Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee will be established on April 3, and he is going to participate, staying in Sichuan for a week before returning to Beijing. Minister He, Director Zhang, and Yue Jun plan to go to Sichuan recently, but the date has not yet been determined. Deng Hanxiang and Lu Zuofu of Sichuan politics and economics went to Beijing to ask the central government for instructions, and the results were satisfactory. Specific methods have been discussed, and He Guoguang will also be able to return to Sichuan soon. Later, when reporters inquired about the truth of the rumor that Guangdong Province will abolish the import tax on foreign rice starting on April 1, Wu replied that Guangdong Province had previously suffered a rice shortage, and the central government had allowed foreign rice to enter with only 1 million dan, with half paying taxes in cash and half on credit, in order to provide relief. Now, there is a rumor that Guangdong Province will exempt the import tax on foreign rice starting next month, but there is no order yet. However, the provinces along the Yangtze River should try to improve the quality of rice to suit the needs of the people of Guangdong Province, which is also important. Around 11:00 a.m., Wu boarded the original plane and continued to fly west to Chengdu. (31st Central News Agency Electric)

[Chengdu] Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang flew directly to Chengdu from Beijing on China Aviation Corporation's aircraft at 3:00 p.m. on the 31st to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Sichuan Provincial National Economic Construction Movement Association. Director of General Affairs Yan Shenyu came with him. Liu Xiang and provincial government hall committee members Deng Hanxiang, Lu Zuofu, Jiang Zhicheng, and Ji Zuyou, along with directors of each hall, section chiefs, secretaries, military commanders Deng Xihou, Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, as well as Director of the Central Military Academy Branch Li Minghao, and Director of the Headquarters Office Lei Biao, and hundreds of others went to the airport to welcome him.

At 4:00 p.m., he went to Liu's residence in Duozi Lane to visit Liu and talked for an hour. At 5:00 p.m., he attended Liu's welcoming banquet at the provincial government. According to Wu, who told the Central News Agency reporter, this trip was to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Sichuan Provincial Economic Construction Movement Association and to discuss with the provincial authorities the issue of developing Sichuan's industry. Wu continued that Sichuan Province can only find a solution by starting from production and construction, but there are two major prerequisites. First, rumors should be dispelled, because frequent rumors will make outside investors hesitant. Second, the provincial authorities must have detailed plans in advance, which will be reviewed by the central government. If the central government needs to help, the central government will do its best to support it. Sichuan Province is rich in products and has a very promising future. There are also many businesses that can be started at present, such as vegetable oil factories and cattle silk trade, which have already achieved results. It is now planned to carry out the improvement of cotton planting and silkworm breeding, as well as the construction of hydropower and rural cooperation, in a practical way. After the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is built, it is necessary to start with afforestation and increase local products. The rumors in Sichuan have now subsided, and there should be no barriers between the central government and the local government. Since Secretary-General Deng went to Beijing, everything has been no problem. I am now coming to Sichuan again, which can further dispel all unreasonable speculation. Because I am busy with affairs in Beijing, I will only stay in Sichuan for a few days and then return to Beijing. (31st Central News Agency Electric)

### The Issue of Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice in Guangdong Province

— Liu

Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order approving Guangdong Province to import 2 million dan of foreign rice and grains tax-free from today until the new harvest, grain merchants in rice-producing provinces and cities have felt uneasy and have petitioned in Nanjing. They have received assurances from the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries that the matter will be discussed and handled. However, with the Ministry of Finance's approval in advance and Guangdong Province's announcement of implementation afterward, the possibility of reversing the situation remains uncertain. What we should ask today, from the perspective of the overall national food issue, is whether such a decision should be made. Since Guangdong Province has been permitted to import 4 million dan of foreign rice and grains tax-free, it is presumably because the country does not have this quantity of rice to meet Guangdong's demand, or even if it does, it cannot urgently alleviate Guangdong's urgent need without importing foreign rice. However, according to another report, the surplus rice that can be exported from Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces is about 20 million dan. The fact that Guangdong Province is only allowed to purchase 4 million dan of foreign rice shows that supplying Guangdong Province with surplus rice from various provinces is not a problem. What we do not understand is the basis for stating that there are 20 million dan of surplus rice and that 4 million dan of foreign rice are necessary to supplement the supply. If the basis for both is accurate, then from the perspective of the overall national food supply, it seems that there is no need to rush to exempt foreign rice imports from taxes.

Furthermore, Guangdong Province's intention seems to be not limited to these 4 million dan of tax-free imports. Therefore, although the deadline for tax-free foreign rice imports is set for September 30th, it will "still be determined based on the supply and demand situation when the new grain is harvested." If the period is extended, will the quantity of tax-free foreign rice be expanded at the same time? Also, if the quantity of imports exceeds the quota, will it also receive tax-free treatment, or will it be stopped immediately without waiting for the deadline to expire? All of these are related to the transportation and sales of domestic rice. However, considering the Ministry's telegram, on the one hand, it relaxes the quantity of foreign rice imported into Guangdong Province and exempts it from tariff burdens to increase imports. On the other hand, the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau, the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Food Regulation Committee are purchasing surplus rice from Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces to transport to Guangdong for assistance. Since the Ministry's telegram has this statement, there is no reason to sit idly by and let domestic rice rot while opening the door to foreign rice imports. Rice merchants in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces do not need to worry about the lack of outlets for surplus rice. The financial authorities must have a reliable and trustworthy grasp of the regulation of domestic rice before they can allow Guangdong Province to import foreign rice tax-free. Otherwise, how can they justify themselves in the regulation of food?

### Japan's New Budget Implemented Today

### Political Turmoil Affects the Market

### Military Forces Control Cabinet; Japanese Diet Suddenly Dissolved

Obstructing Administrative Procedures as Pretext; General Election Scheduled for the 30th of this Month; New Party Movement to Emerge

[Nanjing] A new political upheaval suddenly occurred in Japan today as the Emperor, on the advice of Prime Minister Hayashi, issued an order dissolving the Diet. This move was the result of Prime Minister Hayashi's audience with the Emperor this morning. The two major political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, recently demanded that the government immediately submit the revised election bill, which restricts police activities during national elections, to the Diet. Otherwise, the two parties would hinder the government's important proposals in the Diet and not immediately pass them. As a result, the Cabinet convened an emergency meeting. It was unanimously agreed that the Diet frequently obstructed the government's administrative procedures. After discussion, it was decided to request the Emperor to dissolve the Diet. Earlier this year, there was talk that if political parties continued to oppose the government, it would dissolve the Diet, but it later subsided. Now, not long after, the political turmoil has finally erupted. What the political parties especially oppose is the influence of the military in the Cabinet. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st, Central News Agency)

[Nanjing] The two major parties in the House of Representatives, the Minseito and the Seiyukai, decided yesterday that if the House of Peers did not facilitate the passage of the revised election law restricting the police from exercising inspection powers during national elections, the two parties would prevent 35 important government proposals from passing in the House of Representatives. Upon hearing this, the Cabinet responded with extreme agility, first warning them to change their attitude. Seeing that the warning was ineffective, it issued an order from the Emperor dissolving the Diet after 10 am this morning. Shortly afterward, the government issued a statement saying that the political parties lacked sincerity and deliberately delayed important government proposals related to national defense and the survival of the country, which showed that they completely failed to recognize the true state of the current international situation and were ignorant of the principles of party politics. The government had no choice but to request the dissolution of the Diet and appeal to the people in order to realize the principles of parliamentarism. The government and the people will cooperate in the true sense of the word to overcome Japan's current difficulties and develop the country's prosperity. Since its establishment, the Cabinet has done its best to ensure that its legislative plans are approved by the Diet. However, the political parties arbitrarily obstructed various bills that were of great importance to national defense and the stability of the national life. Therefore, the extent to which the political parties understood Japan's difficult situation and their enthusiasm for contributing to the constitutional government was doubtful, and it was no wonder that voices calling for reform of the parliamentary system were rising from all sides. Therefore, the government decided to dissolve the Diet and appeal to the whole country. The general election is scheduled for April 30th.

It is noteworthy that the unprecedented military budget has just been passed, and the Diet has been overthrown. The political parties opposed the military controlling the Cabinet, and therefore incurred the military's displeasure. The talk of dissolution had been brewing for a long time. The reason why it had not been realized immediately was because the government's financial plan, which included huge military expenditures, had not yet been established. According to general opinion, the Diet's approval of the financial plan was tantamount to signing its own death warrant.

The government's stern action today was like a bolt from the blue, which was not expected by anyone in the political parties. Therefore, they all regarded it as another unprecedented and extraordinary action by the Hayashi Cabinet. At the beginning of his cabinet formation, Hayashi was willing to offer cabinet seats to members of political parties, but on the condition that they leave their parties. Then, on March 25th, he extended the Diet session by six days (usually a maximum of five days). Finally, on the last day, he dissolved the Diet. This is truly an unprecedented event in Japanese parliamentary history. According to various newspapers, the current political turmoil was caused by the exchange of rights and interests between political parties through despicable acts. Therefore, all newspapers strongly criticized the major political parties. It is said that in December last year, the Election Law Reform Committee proposed amending the election law. However, due to the change of cabinet, the government failed to submit the bill to the Diet in accordance with the committee's recommendations. Instead, the major political parties submitted bills to the Diet that excluded various points proposed by the committee to clarify election campaigns and contained provisions that legalized existing election campaign tactics. The Daily News today carried an editorial stating that the political parties intended to amend the election law to create lenient provisions, but took no action to clarify election tactics. This was extremely selfish. Furthermore, if the bills submitted by the political parties were passed, they would be applied retroactively, and the result would be that all 300 people currently imprisoned for improper conduct in the election would be released, and the 20,000 people who had been fined or otherwise punished for the same crime would be exempted. The government announced today that it would do everything in its power to ensure that pure Diet elections could be realized. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st, Central News Agency)

### Prospects for the Dissolution of Parliament and the Japanese Political Situation

[Nanjing] This session of parliament was originally scheduled to close today, but unexpectedly became the day of the dissolution of the House of Representatives, which was truly beyond expectation. The government expressed extreme indignation at the deliberate delays by the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties in discussing important bills, and at the two parties' efforts to pass their proposed amendments to the election law, which had already been decided by the House of Representatives. This attitude was already clearly revealed last night.

Minister of the Navy Insists on Dissolution

Therefore, during the emergency cabinet meeting last night, Minister of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai strongly advocated dissolution, and suddenly the idea of dissolution became rampant. We still remember that on the last day of the Hirota Cabinet, Terauchi insisted on dissolving the parliament with great effort, while Nagano firmly opposed it. This time, Yonai's attitude was very different from that of the former Minister of the Navy, causing many people to feel as if they were in a fog. However, according to general observations, this change can be explained as follows: Nagano opposed dissolving the parliament before the new budget was passed. Now that the budget bill has been formally passed yesterday, and there are no obstacles to expanding armaments, Yonai's attitude is naturally different from Nagano's. The emergency cabinet meeting last night continued until late at night and did not end. Afterwards, Prime Minister Hayashi held secret consultations with Chief Cabinet Secretary Ōhashi and Director of the Legislative Bureau Kawagoe, which only ended at 3 a.m. this morning. After the cabinet meeting, a brief communiqué was issued, stating only that the government did not intend to extend the parliament again, and if necessary, the government would not hesitate to dissolve the parliament.

National Atonishment

At that time, general observers felt that the government would not take measures to dissolve the parliament, because the budget bill and many other important bills had been approved by both houses, and although other important bills had not yet been passed, it seemed insufficient as an excuse for dissolution. However, the reality was not so. After holding another emergency cabinet meeting at 9 a.m. this morning, Prime Minister Hayashi entered the palace to have an audience with the Emperor, requesting the dissolution of the House of Representatives. Subsequently, at 10:30 a.m., he obtained the Emperor's approval. As a result, the general atmosphere of optimism that the House of Representatives had been spared its bad fate was completely swept away. This severe action was not only beyond the initial expectations of those standing outside the political arena, but also surprised the political parties and other political circles in Japan.

Announcing Reasons for Dissolution

According to the official announcement of the reasons for dissolving the parliament, "Recently, the situation of the House of Representatives deliberating on various important bills showed a lack of sincerity. The House of Representatives also hindered the progress of deliberation on various bills, especially important bills that have a profound relationship with the prosperity of the country and the stability of the people's lives. The government cannot help but express doubts about the House of Representatives' understanding of the current serious situation and its enthusiasm for assisting in the promotion of constitutional politics. Therefore, it is a matter of urgency to advocate for the renewal of the parliament. It is for this reason that the government is willing to appeal to the fair and selfless conscience of the people to seek a standard of true right and wrong."

Giving the Government an Excuse

Because of the "renewal of the parliament" and the dissolution of the parliament after the complete establishment of the budget bill, from the perspective of the reasons and timing of the dissolution, it is truly the only unprecedented event in the sixteen dissolutions since the establishment of the Japanese parliament forty-nine years ago. This session of parliament was adjourned for twenty-five days and only met for six weeks. During this period, in addition to the huge budget, half of the eighty-three bills proposed by the government have been completely passed, which proves that the deliberation of the parliament is actually progressing extremely quickly. The Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties only urged the government to approve their proposal to amend the election law in the previous few days, giving the impression of delaying the deliberation of government bills, and giving the government an excuse to take this severe action on the last day of the parliament.

Future of the Cabinet's Fate

Then what will be the aftermath of the dissolution? According to our observation, if the Hayashi cabinet maintains a compromise with the two major political parties, the cabinet's fate can be maintained at least until the end of this year. However, the current cabinet does not take the above path but proceeds with dissolution, and decides to hold a general election on April 30. Therefore, according to the constitution, a special parliament must be convened within five months. It is very obvious that the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties will launch a fierce and merciless counterattack against the cabinet during the special parliament period. The life of the cabinet will inevitably be shortened as a result.

Movement to Form a New Party

From the above situation, it is generally believed that there are several factors behind the current action, namely: ㊀ From the beginning of the formation of the Hayashi cabinet, it seemed to have guaranteed the political promotion faction that after the budget bill was passed, the parliament would be dissolved immediately to "renew parliamentary politics." ㊁ The government seemed to have firmly believed that the movement to form a new party had reached a considerable degree of maturity, and decided to use the new party as a basis to compete with the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties in the future elections, hoping to obtain a majority in the parliament as much as possible to pacify the political situation and enable the cabinet to extricate itself from the oppression of established political parties. In case the new party cannot obtain a majority, the government may order dissolution again. ㊂ Many important members of the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties will unite under a new banner, create a new situation based on a more stringent system of control. This is now very hopeful. In addition to the above, it is currently difficult to find other definite factors.

Seiyūkai and Minseitō Parties Indignant

The Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties issued statements today, accusing the government's dissolution order of being an action that violates the constitution, and expressed extreme indignation at this move. Especially because this move came after the budget bill was passed, the financial circles generally opposed the dissolution. The left-wing Social Mass Party expressed its support for the dissolution, because another new election can give the party more opportunities to expand. The right-wing Tōhōkai and Kokumin Dōmei expressed their approval for the dissolution, because it can promote the politics of the control faction.

How will a new party be formed in the future? Who will be the leaders and cadres of the new party? To what extent will the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties be divided? How will the small parties recombine? All these are extremely noteworthy questions. The results of the new general election can be revealed on May 3 or 4, which can indicate whether Japan's political state remains moderate or clearly leans to the right. (Central News Agency, 31st dispatch)

### Prime Minister Hayashi Issues Statement

[Nanjing] Prime Minister Hayashi issued a statement on the situation at 5 p.m. on the 31st at the Prime Minister's official residence, regarding the reasons for dissolving the parliament, his state of mind after dealing with the general election, and other current issues, as follows:

㊀ Reasons for Dissolution: This parliament attempted to pass many bills, but by the end of the session, the deliberation of the bills was extremely stagnant. In my opinion, the political parties lacked sincerity. Whether it was intentional has not been determined, but bills of great importance to national defense and the stability of the people's lives have not yet been deliberated. On the night of the 30th, they suddenly took a long break and adjourned. We are truly regretful. Such a situation cannot be worthy of the trust of the people, so we should appeal to the people's proper conscience to seek their judgment. There is no other way. Therefore, as the first step in renewing the parliament, the House of Representatives was decisively dissolved.

㊁ Attitude towards the General Election: We hope that the government and the opposition will cooperate in the general election. Among the established political parties, those who have the same understanding of the situation as us should also be recognized and deal with the situation with a clear understanding. Countermeasures must also be established. In this sense, the government should strive to find opportunities to clarify specific policies and platforms, etc. We are currently working hard on research. If there are other appropriate methods, we should also use the opportunity to thoroughly inform the people of the government's policy. If a new group is established to maintain the government, we should resonate with it. However, the government is not currently eager to create a new group and shake hands with it. Regarding the political state after the general election, it is not yet possible to predict, but we believe that the path that the government should take should be

## Page 8

Clear. Regardless of whether our understanding is wrong as a result of the election, if the newly elected members are still the same as before, then how the government will deal with it is also very clear. In short, what attitude should be taken towards the political situation after the general election, and wait until then to consider it, etc. (31st Allied Press dispatch)

### Two Major Japanese Parties Criticize the Government

Regret for Unconstitutionality, Prepared to Fight to the Death

[Tokyo] The Seiyūkai issued a statement on the dissolution of the House of Representatives in the form of a speech by Secretary-General Andō, as follows:

This dissolution is without reason. The Hayashi Cabinet has no basis in the House of Representatives, and has passed the budget, tax increases, and many other bills. This is all due to the fact that the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties have taken a completely coordinated attitude based on the overall situation of national unity. The government may use the reason that deliberation is slow and not progressing, but it is not known. This parliament has repeatedly suffered adjournments and recesses, wasting twenty-five days of time, and submitted a mountain of bills in advance, wanting us to swallow them in one gulp. This kind of attitude is to disregard the deliberative power of the parliament and make unreasonable demands. We must never exercise rough deliberation in our duties. The Hayashi Cabinet suddenly implemented the dissolution on the last day of the parliament. This is based on the fundamental concept of mistakenly viewing the parliament as a meeting of administrative agencies, and it is also a regrettable action due to a lack of understanding of constitutional politics. When our party attends the general election, we must advocate this important significance and fight to the death with it openly and honestly. We hereby clarify, etc. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)

[Tokyo] At 11:40 a.m. on the 31st, the Minseitō held a general meeting of members in the lounge of the parliament, and President Machida gave a speech criticizing the government, saying that its attitude was an unconstitutional act, and made various criticisms. The strategy for the general election will be discussed again at a joint meeting convened on April 5 in order to clarify the various points. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)

### Attitude of Small Parties

[Nanjing] The Social Mass Party issued a statement on the dissolution of the parliament today, as follows:

The amendment to the election law to relieve election law violators, the established political parties made illegal demands for trade, in order to pass it, is the direct cause of this dissolution. We still find it difficult to understand that its dissolution is too late. The vast budget that disregards the stability of the people's lives has been passed, and the deliberation of social policies has been exhausted, all of which prove that the era of established political parties is wrong. We intend to crush all established forces in the future elections, and fill the new parliament with the leaping power of the emerging masses. This is what we hope for, etc. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)

[Nanjing] The neutral faction issued a statement as follows:

The extreme tyranny of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai is irreconcilable, plunging the political situation into chaos, hindering the implementation of national affairs, promoting the reversal of the constitution, etc. We believe that all these sins should be borne by the two major political parties, etc. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)

[Nanjing] The Kokumin Dōmei convened a meeting of members today, attacking the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties, and decided to move towards the path of reform, issuing a statement, the main points of which are as follows: To renew the general administration, we should first start by reforming the political parties. We hope to rectify the elections and create a clear parliament. In addition to reforming the political parties, issues such as the solution to the electricity problem, the reform of the education system, the establishment of the Ministry of Aviation, the renewal of the tax system, and the reform of the administrative structure should all be submitted to the people for judgment, etc. (Allied Press dispatch between the 31st)

### Observations on the Political Situation by Members of the House of Peers

If the Establishment of a New Party Fails, the Cabinet Will Inevitably Resign En Masse

[Tokyo] Various aspects of the House of Peers criticized the dissolution of the House of Representatives as follows:

The government's mistake in the House of Representatives' recent attitude towards deliberating on important bills, and the implementation of the dissolution may be unavoidable, but during the session, it was expected that all important bills could be passed, and the dissolution was actually carried out, which is a problem. Therefore, the new party problem arising from this dissolution is inevitable, and the division of the political circles should also cause considerable changes. If the current cabinet can fully place its foundation on the future new political party, then the 70th parliament will have no party and achieve considerable results, so it can be considered to have sustainability. Otherwise, the opposition to the established political parties will become more intense, and it will be difficult to avoid resignation en masse, etc. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)

[Tokyo] The government believes that the House of Representatives lacks sincerity in deliberating on national affairs, and implements the dissolution in the sense of renewing the parliament. However, during the general election, the government has no party to deal with, and this strong-handed approach gives the political parties a painful stimulus. It is expected that there will be a profound resistance, but the government's adoption of this attitude, inside it, is the monitoring and self-confidence of the new party movement lurking in it. It is said that the purpose of this dissolution is not only to promote the reflection of the political parties, but will further and urgently seek the emergence of a conscious political party from now on. It is very obvious. In this sense, Prime Minister Hayashi and all the cabinet members will awaken the people in the general election and clarify the special significance of this dissolution of the parliament. Moreover, there is a considerable shaking situation within the parties in the political parties. It will also use this dissolution as an opportunity to unite the reform elements and start to become active. The crisis of the political parties themselves splitting is likely to be encountered. Therefore, the government is quietly watching the development of the situation, intending to guide this reformative atmosphere in order to establish a new party, etc. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)

### Britain to Negotiate with Japan to Avoid Naval Competition

Hoping to Maintain the Tonnage Limit for Battleships, Saitō Hiroshi Claims that Japan's Military Expansion is for Self-Defense

[London] Regarding the problem of the caliber limitation of battleship guns, the Japanese government notified the British government a few days ago that it refused to accept the 14-inch caliber. It is learned that the British government is afraid that this move by Japan will affect the current situation, which will increase the battleship tonnage to more than 25,000 tons and cause a naval arms race. Therefore, it will conduct diplomatic negotiations with that country soon, hoping to avoid it. Naval circles generally believe that after the battleship gun caliber is actually increased one day, there is no need to increase the tonnage. In short, the 35,000-ton restriction method stipulated in the 1936 London Naval Treaty should still be maintained. If any naval country wants to adopt a 16-inch caliber, it may as well follow the example of the United States, in other words, to install 16-inch caliber guns on a 35,000-ton battleship. Roughly, Britain will explain to various naval countries, especially Japan, that if the battleship tonnage is increased to more than 25,000 tons, not only will the construction cost increase, but also the harbors and docks will have to be expanded accordingly. These costs are very high and cannot be ignored. Moreover, in terms of tonnage, competition, no matter what, Japan will hardly gain the upper hand, so why do it, etc. In addition, many British newspapers commented on Japan's decision, and many believed that a naval arms race was inevitable, and therefore held radical views. This is quite unpleasant in official circles, and will advise the newspapers to turn their tone to a more moderate one, etc. (Central News Agency, 30th dispatch from Havas)

[New York] Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saitō said in a speech to the annual banquet of the Japanese Association today that Japan's military expansion policy is no different from that of the United States, and is purely for self-defense, which is to modernize the Japanese army so that it can be on par with the armies of neighboring countries such as China and Russia. If the Japanese army really intends to start a war with its neighbors, or thinks of controlling its neighbors, if the Japanese navy really wants to compete with other naval powers, then its military expenditure will far exceed the current budget. Unfortunately, Japan's position is not good, and its products are not abundant. If countries such as Britain and the United States were in the same position, their military policy would not be much different from that of Japan. Japan now takes protecting the security of Japan and Manchuria from attack with sufficient strength as its duty. Although we do not think that such actions will happen immediately, modern countries must be prepared for unforeseen circumstances, etc. (National Power dispatch on the 30th)

### Davis Sent to London

Generally Believed to Have an Important Mission

[London] U.S. representative Davis arrived at Plymouth Harbor today and told the press that he was representing the United States at the International Sugar Conference. However, the press believed that Davis's statement was obviously a disguise. He must have a secret and important diplomatic mission to London this time, because no one believes that the United States would send Roosevelt's right arm and the first-class diplomat of the United States as a representative for an international sugar conference. The newspapers believe that Davis is here to inquire about the attitude of Britain and the Dominions towards the international tariff agreement, rather than formally discussing European issues regarding disarmament.

[London] In March, various shipyards in Clyde received a total of twenty-one new orders, the price of which reached 10 million pounds, most of which belonged to the Admiralty. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters dispatch)

### Germany Sends Minister of Defense to Attend the Coronation of the British King

A Symbol of Friendship between the Two Countries

[Berlin] The fact that General von Blomberg, Minister of Defense, was appointed as the special envoy representing Head of State Hitler to attend the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor is the topic of discussion in official circles today. The public opinion is that Germany's move, in the eyes of Britain, should be regarded as a special symbol of Germany's friendly attitude towards Britain. The Angeliff newspaper reported that Germany used the first-class military officer after the head of state as its representative, which is suitable for the nature of Germany as a world power. Germany's enemies have misunderstood Germany's policy and infused it into the British people, causing the British people to have many doubts about the peaceful intentions of Germany's policy. Now, von Blomberg's trip should dispel their doubts. This is one of the reasons why Germany appointed von Blomberg as the special envoy. In short, the one who wants to gain the understanding of the British people is the German armed forces, etc. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters dispatch)

### German Head of State and Ludendorff

Releasing Resentment and Reconciling, Two People's Secret Talks Achieve Satisfactory Results, Famous General of the European War Will Reassume Military Position

⊙Munich The dark struggle between German Head of State Hitler and famous General Ludendorff in the European War has lasted for twelve years. It has now come to a complete reconciliation. The government officially announced today that after secret talks between Hitler and Ludendorff today, Ludendorff expressed his respect for Hitler's ability to wash away the shame of Versailles and create a moral unity of the country. At the same time, Hitler expressed his joy that the country and the national army can reunite with the famous generals of the European War. It is reported that Hitler and Ludendorff were originally leaders of the Allied forces during the Munich Uprising in 1923. However, after Ludendorff's presidential election failure in 1924, a gap was created. Ludendorff was the chief of staff of General Hindenburg during the European War. He made great contributions in the Battle of Tannenberg, causing the Russian army to collapse and suffer a crushing defeat, and Germany no longer had to worry about the east. Ludendorff will be 72 years old on April 9 this year. (Central News Agency, 31st Reuters dispatch)

⊙Munich The semi-official German News Agency announced the course of the meeting between Chancellor Hitler and General Ludendorff, declaring that "the two held frank and open talks in order to overcome the difficulties and misunderstandings that hinder the interests of the German people, and the results were very satisfactory. Ludendorff declared that he admired Chancellor Hitler's great achievements very much, because Hitler destroyed the infamous Treaty of Versailles and enabled the German people to defend themselves, and even rebuilt Germany's rule in the Rhine. Ludendorff continued to express his satisfaction with the spirit of unity and solidarity of the German people, and said that this spirit can solve all difficult problems. Chancellor Hitler said that the Third German Republic and its army are now standing on a firm and unwavering position, and expressed his satisfaction with the spirit of the loyal soldiers of November 9, 1923. (National Maritime dispatch on the 30th)

[Berlin] After Head of State Hitler met with General Ludendorff, Chief of Staff of the Army during the European War, members of the National Socialist Party believed that the Head of State should appoint Ludendorff as a General and establish a "National Defense Commission" with Ludendorff as the chairman. General Ludendorff is the only surviving famous general of the former German Empire. Head of State Hitler has now reconciled with him, which is enthusiastically supported by members of the National Socialist Party. However, Catholic people are quite uneasy because Ludendorff has a tendency of neo-paganism. (Central News Agency, 31st dispatch from Havas)

[Paris] Regarding the matter of German Head of State Hitler and General Ludendorff releasing resentment and reconciling, the famous reporter Bertina recently published an article in the Paris Echo, adding a commentary, saying that it has no political significance. It also said that before the European War, the German deposed emperor was ambitious and often made unreasonable provocative acts, which eventually caused all countries in the world to unite against Germany. To investigate the reason, General Ludendorff should actually take the blame. Now, his re-emergence may contain some kind of sign, but it also makes us remember that Head of State Hitler is still surrounded by irrational elements. The Japanese newspaper published a message from a visitor in Berlin saying that after Head of State Hitler and General Ludendorff held talks, Ludendorff may rejoin the active army and serve as an advisor to the General Staff of the Third Germany. This is the important relationship between the two men's conversation. (Central News Agency, 31st dispatch from Havas)

### Sky War on the Southern Spanish Front

Government Forces Capture Two Important Towns

⊙Angdgar City, Caordoba Province: Our correspondent witnessed an aerial battle here last night. More than thirty aircraft from both sides participated in the engagement. The Nationalist forces initiated the attack with a fierce assault on the city. Government offices issued four warnings to the residents. During the last warning, the actual battle commenced. The Nationalist side deployed four German Junkers bombers, escorted by eight fighter planes. Eight government fighter planes ascended to engage, driving away the Nationalist aircraft. Subsequently, both sides reinforced their squadrons, totaling more than thirty aircraft. The government aircraft encircled the Nationalist planes, strafing them with machine-gun fire. After fifteen minutes, the battle intensified. Although the Nationalist forces had more aircraft, they retreated rapidly along the Guadalquivir River, pursued by the government planes. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 31st)

⊙Valencia: According to our correspondent, government forces launched an offensive in the Pozoblanco area of Córdoba Province in the south yesterday. They achieved significant success, capturing two important positions, Alcaracejos and Villanueva del Duque, after fierce hand-to-hand combat. Numerous Nationalist soldiers, mostly Moorish soldiers, were captured. With this victory, the Nationalist attempt to attack the southern "Coal Road" (the southern region is a coal-producing area) has been completely thwarted. The news of the victory brought great joy to the people here, who are eager to know the exact number of prisoners and spoils of war. Responsible officials also stated that the government's militia has become increasingly experienced in combat, and its air superiority has become increasingly apparent. Although the navy has been inactive for several weeks, it has now rejoined the war and is achieving good results. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 31st)

⊙Angdgar City, Caordoba Province: Our correspondent reports exclusively that government forces in the south attacked and occupied the towns of Alcaracejos and Villanueva del Duque in this province yesterday, taking them at 6 PM. Recently, Nationalist forces advanced north from Malaga Province, hoping to seize the Almadén mercury mine and the Puertollano coal mine in this province, launching a strong offensive. Government forces also launched a counteroffensive south of Pozoblanco, engaging in fierce battles for several days. Yesterday's battle resulted in a victory for the government forces. The details of the battle are as follows: Government forces seized several strategic locations at dawn, especially the Mingyue Church and Mirabueno Ridge. The Nationalist forces attempted a feint, advancing on the northwest of Pozoblanco to divert attention, but were unsuccessful. Government forces intensified their advance, with soldiers bravely throwing hand grenades, rarely using other weapons. After a period of hand-to-hand combat, they reached the outskirts of Alcaracejos, about two kilometers away, and surrounded the town, capturing it shortly thereafter. Government forces then pushed forward, and when they reached Villanueva del Duque, the Nationalist forces offered only slight resistance before retreating, allowing the government forces to occupy it continuously. Government aircraft have been assisting in the battles on the Córdoba front for several days, providing effective support by bombing Nationalist positions in Mondoloberia, Poblblonubofu, and Villataribo. Several Nationalist transport trucks were destroyed by government aircraft near Alcaracejos. Yesterday's victory was largely due to the air force's bombing.

### Plot of Mutiny Among Franco's Troops

Discovered Beforehand, Many Killed

[London] A spokesperson for the Spanish Embassy announced today that a mutiny plot had been discovered in the territories controlled by the Spanish anti-Moroccan rebels. The spokesperson stated that the ladder incident was only part of the plot. In other cities such as Salamanca, Burgos, and Malaga, troops opposed the civil war and foreign intervention, which greatly damaged Spain's dignity. In Morocco, due to the shortage of wheat flour, the Moors also participated in the mutiny. Fifty people have been executed in the ladder incident, including several officers. (National Telegram, 30th)

⊙Gibraltar: It was learned today that some soldiers in the rebel army in Algeciras also pledged allegiance to the Madrid government and raised the flag of the republican government. However, the mutiny was quickly suppressed, and many leaders were executed. It is said that the rebel authorities shot 27 riflemen and searched the streets, arresting many suspects. Two bombs exploded there this afternoon, one in the rebel camp. Two bombs also exploded yesterday. It is also rumored here that there was a mutiny in La Línea, which was probably caused by the Spaniards' jealousy of the Italian and German soldiers who controlled military power.

### Spanish Rebels Intercept British Ships, Britain Protests

[London] The Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet has been ordered to protest to the naval authorities of the Spanish Nationalist forces in Cadiz against the Nationalist warships stopping three British ships. The British government argues that this action violates international law because the warships of the anti-government faction, according to international practice, only have the right to hail and question ships of other countries. The British government is making every effort to ensure that British ships comply with the law and do not carry war materials. Therefore, there is no reason for the Nationalist warships to stop British ships for search. The British government requests the Nationalist forces to guarantee that such actions will not occur again in the future. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 30th)

### Italy Officially Acknowledges Addis Ababa Massacre

Indian Shops Closed, Britain Protests to Italy

[Rome] British newspapers have repeatedly commented on the massacre in Addis Ababa by Italian troops after Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia Graziani was attacked in February. The official here issued an article today refuting the reports, saying that Italian troops did not indiscriminately shoot residents and did not set fire to native houses except where weapons were found. However, several foreign-owned shops were ordered to close because they were engaged in anti-Italian espionage activities. This is Italy's first official acknowledgment of the massacre.

Italian editor Gaida claimed today that all shops owned by British businessman Mohammed Ali were closed, and his Indian shop assistants were expelled because several branch managers were agents of the British consulate. The close relationship between the British infiltration policy and the Indian shop organization is evident. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 31st)

[London] The British government has protested to both the Roman and anti-Roman authorities in Addis Ababa today over the closure of Indian shops owned by British businessman Mohammed Ali in the capital of Abyssinia. The British government questioned the reasons for the closure and argued that the shops were only given notice of closure on March 6th, with only 18 days to comply. The British side believes the time frame is insufficient. The deadline has now been extended by the Italian side, but the reasons for the closure have not been announced.

### Guangdong Business Community酝酿罢业（Yùnniàng bàiyè - brewing strike）

After the Financial Department Promulgated New Business Tax Regulations, 波澜（bōlán - disturbance / great waves). 商会致函财厅为恳切的陈请（Shānghuì zhìhán cáitīng wèi kěnqì de chénqǐng - The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Department of Finance with an earnest request.)

Guangzhou Correspondence: Merchants in Guangdong Province have repeatedly requested the authorities to improve the new business tax regulations and change the tax standards based on business turnover, but the authorities have not allowed it. Recently, the Financial Department only approved the reduction of the business tax rate, which is still not in line with the wishes of the merchants over the past few months. Therefore, dozens of representatives from chambers of commerce across the province gathered in Guangzhou and decided to hold a large-scale petition. It was originally scheduled to take place on the 27th. However, the Municipal Party Department did not approve the issuance of an assembly permit. Moreover, the merchants originally intended to appeal to Chairman Lin of the National Government, but Chairman Lin had gone to Conghua for hot springs ahead of schedule and had not yet returned to Guangzhou. Therefore, the petition may be rescheduled. On the 26th, representatives of various merchants held another meeting to prepare for the petition. They sent representatives Cai Chang, Zou Dianbang, He Jiping, and others with a letter to the Financial Department to appeal. Gui Jingqiu, the chief secretary of the Financial Department, replied that if merchants had requests, they could be relayed and handled by superiors, and that there was no need for a joint large-scale petition, which would affect public safety. The representatives returned to the meeting and reported the situation to the public. Various merchants then convened a meeting overnight to discuss everything. They immediately decided that the petition would only be stopped if the Financial Department had a clear statement withdrawing the new business tax regulations. Otherwise, merchants at the critical moment of life and death would fight to the death. The letter from the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce to the Financial Department is attached below: "Since the promulgation of the new business tax regulations, both the city and its subordinate areas have found them difficult to implement. The new regulations change the category of capital-based taxation to taxation based on business income. The habit of the Guangdong business community has always been to make small profits and do more business. Every commodity is sold several times before it reaches the hands of consumers. If taxes are levied repeatedly, it will inevitably impose a heavy burden, leading to transfer and greatly affecting people's lives. Those that cannot be transferred will have no business to operate. Even if we exhaust the profits of the Guangdong business community, it will still not be enough to pay taxes. Therefore, the new regulations may be feasible in other provinces, but they are absolutely not feasible in Guangdong Province. The difficult realities have been communicated in writing. Subsequently, your department replied that the facts and environmental aspects mentioned were still worthy of consideration. Director Zheng of the Business Tax Bureau has repeatedly consulted with representatives of the business community in the city, intending to increase tax revenue. The city must raise two million yuan to facilitate negotiation. Therefore, the Guangzhou Commercial Discussion Conference decided to establish a tax system research committee under the principle of being able to bear the burden of commercial power and avoiding harassment. They have been working hard for two months, carefully reviewing the shops in the city. The first review covered more than 6,000 shops, with the original tax amount being more than 189,000 yuan. As a result of the review, it increased to more than 570,000 yuan, an increase of more than twice. On the 27th of last month, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce sent representatives to report to your department. Secretary Gui was received and promised to continue the review and agreed to seven measures. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce was planning to continue. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd of this month, we suddenly received a public letter from your department and amended the articles of association, which still used business income as the tax standard, with only a slight reduction in the tax rate. All the deliberation methods of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Tax System Committee were not adopted, causing the tax system committee of the whole city to be blamed by the merchants and forced to resign as a whole. This move not only disappointed the merchants in the city, but also angered the representatives of the chambers of commerce in various prefectures. Guangzhou shops and merchants opened a discussion meeting and publicly decided to hold a petition. If the petition is invalid, merchants will have no business to operate and will only suspend operations to wait for a solution. The representatives of the chambers of commerce in the province expressed sympathy. Now the key points of public opinion requests must earnestly request your department to still include most of the business tax tax standards into the capital amount tax. If it is absolutely necessary to include several items into the business turnover tax, the tax rate must be particularly reduced and estimated based on external observation. After the estimate, no further increase will be made. The prerequisite is that the revised business tax regulations should be announced immediately to withdraw the orders. The representatives of the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce have the same only hope, hoping that the Guangdong business community has special circumstances, and the implementation of the new business tax regulations is tantamount to placing the business in desperation. Immediately withdraw the revised business tax regulations and follow the above-mentioned requests to stabilize the business." (Evening of March 26)

### Fuzhou Business Tax Issues

The Financial Department Sends Personnel to Explain to the Business Community, Which Still Insists on Reducing the Tax Rate

Fuzhou Correspondence: The various merchant guilds in this city believe that the newly revised ordinary business tax rate of the Financial Department is much higher than before, and the Provincial Capital Tax Bureau's business income survey, which is used as a tax standard, has been assessed too high. When the two are combined, the business tax paid by merchants is more than ten times higher than before for those who pay more, and five or six times higher for those who pay less, making it difficult to bear. For days, they have elected representatives to petition the Financial Department and the Tax Bureau, demanding a reduction in the tax rate, correcting the business amount, and canceling the special business tax that has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to be abolished. The situation is quite tense. The Financial Department sent Section Chief Yan Zhichao on the 25th to convene a discussion meeting with merchants at the Chamber of Commerce. More than a thousand merchants from various industries attended. Yan Zhichao first explained, saying, "In the past, business tax was allocated by the leaders of the various guilds, which was no different from a contract nature. The purpose of the current rectification is to improve the tax rules and make it a legitimate tax revenue. Merchants suspect that the tax rate is too high, but in fact, compared with the business tax rates of other provinces, the rate set in this province is not only not high, but also lower. If taxed based on business turnover, the rate set in this province is from 3/1000 to 10/1000, while many other provinces have rates from 5/1000 to 1%. If taxed based on capital, the rate set in this province is from 5/1000 to 15/1000, while many other provinces have rates as high as 20/1000. The outline of the business tax promulgated by the Ministry of Finance in the 20th year of the Republic was 2/1000, which was set at the beginning and has become a past system. The tax rate set in this province in the 25th year of the Republic has been revised and filed by the Ministry of Finance, which is a legitimate tax pasture. We sincerely hope that merchants will not misunderstand. As for the request to exempt the special business tax and abolish the harsh taxes, the government is also planning it. For example, more than 300 kinds of harsh taxes were abolished last year, totaling more than 5 million yuan. In January of this year, the Xiamen fruit business tax was abolished, and in February, the Putian and Xian bamboo and wood tax was also exempted. Recently, the Zhangzhou rice donation was also revoked. The reduction and exemption have their own steps. After the ordinary business tax is rectified and there are some achievements, the special business tax can be gradually abolished. We also hope that merchants in various industries will understand the government's intentions." Then, merchants from various industries stated their difficulties one after another, requesting consideration of the commercial situation, canceling the special business tax, highway allocation bonds, and various harsh taxes, as well as the upstream temporary defense subsidy fee that was clearly ordered to be abolished by the Yuan and Ministry, to leave a glimmer of hope for Fujian merchants, and that Fuzhou's business is a transportation area, and the physiology depends entirely on the upstream. Since the Minbei highway is accessible, it can directly purchase from Zhejiang and Shanghai, and due to the heavy tax, it will change its route, not only affecting the merchants' physiology, but also the government's tax revenue, which should be considered by the government. Yan Zhichao said that he would wait for Chen Yi to return to Fujian and forward the various points stated by the merchants for review. Finally, the merchants said that this time, various merchants are unable to bear the new tax rate and requested that the government temporarily postpone the collection before the Ministry of Finance has clearly resolved it. Yan agreed to forward it to the Director of the Financial Department, and then announced the adjournment.

As for the Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, it also raised two points of view to the Provincial Government regarding this change of business tax. (1) Regarding the legal point, the business tax collection regulations of this province are based on the Business Tax Law and the measures for reorganizing business tax decided at the National Financial Conference in the 23rd year of the Republic, and have been consulted and approved by the Ministry of Finance for revision and promulgation. They should be effective. However, regarding the implementation, there should be a prerequisite, that is, whether various special business taxes and various harsh taxes and donations have been removed uniformly. If they have not been removed, what the Financial Department calls reorganization is not in agreement with the righteousness. (2) Regarding the factual point, the commerce in this province is extremely depressed. Imported goods are invading more and more. If taxes and donations are heavy, the cost will also be heavy. How can they compete in the commercial world? As for this time, the tax bureau sent personnel to investigate, and there were often errors in the tax standard. It should be urgently ordered to correct them and temporarily collect the tax according to the original tax rate before the Ministry's reply is approved. Also, on the 20th of every month, stores throughout the city paste slogans at the doors requesting the government to abolish the harsh taxes and collect taxes in accordance with the Ministry's Outline. It is said that the views of officials and businessmen are still difficult to unify. (27th)

### Survey of Henan's Vegetable Oil Materials

Including Five Types: Soybeans, Peanuts, etc. Annual Output Value of Tens of Millions of Yuan

Zhengzhou Correspondence: The China Vegetable Oil Materials Company of the Ministry of Industry recently dispatched agricultural product specialist Zhao Tonggong to Henan. He has now completed the survey of the output of vegetable oil materials in various counties in Henan and is about to return to Beijing. According to Zhao's talk about the results of the survey, he said, "Henan is vast and has convenient transportation in all directions. The abundance of its vegetable oil materials is unmatched by other provinces. For example, seven counties including Zhongmu produce more than 4.2 million dan of peanuts. Yancheng and other places produce 2.7 million dan of sesame annually. This is only a simple survey of counties near the Pinghan and Longhai railways with convenient transportation. If a detailed survey of the entire province is conducted, its output will be many times higher than this. In addition, there are more than 13 million dan of soybeans and 480,000 dan of rapeseed. In a province with such abundant agricultural products, if the central and provincial governments cooperate to establish a large-scale machine oil mill, not only will unscrupulous merchants be unable to manipulate grain prices, but farmers will also benefit. Moreover, if oil exports are smooth, raw material prices will naturally rise, and farmers will benefit even more, which is in line with the meaning of the National Economic Construction Movement." Zhao's detailed report on the production of peanuts, cottonseed, and sesame in various counties is recorded separately below:

### Changshu

Requests from Merchants to Reduce Business Tax

Merchants in this area, feeling that the business tax levied by the authorities is excessively high, held a meeting on the 30th through the County Chamber of Commerce and decided to petition the province for a reduction of 10,000 yuan. This is because the business tax quota for this county is set at 100,000 yuan annually, which the province lists as a first-class county for collection. This highest tax rate is based on the Finance Department's view of this county as a prosperous commercial area. In reality, it is difficult to compare it with counties like Suzhou and Wuxi. Furthermore, with repeated disasters and disturbances in recent years, various industries have visibly declined. However, the business tax has only increased, and merchants and residents are truly unable to bear it. Subsequently, the Business Tax Bureau indicated that the county's annual levy of 100,000 yuan is a standard set by the province, but at least 65% must be collected before it can be submitted to the Finance Department for verification; otherwise, the bureau will be held responsible for covering the shortfall. Now that the merchants are requesting a tax reduction, it is thought that if it can be within the established percentage, the Finance Department should have no problem with it.

Difficult Prospects for Establishing Rent Collection Stations

The county government, in order to facilitate rent payment for tenants, had previously drafted organizational measures for rent collection stations and submitted them to the Finance Department for approval to implement on a trial basis. The plan was to establish a rent collection station in a suitable township in each district, with personnel recommended by landlords and supervised by the township head. Renters could then directly contact the rent collection station for rent payment. However, the landlords considered this organization to be less than ideal, as it not only provided no benefit to tax-paying landlords but also risked encouraging delays in rent payment by tenants. Subsequently, they jointly petitioned the Provincial Finance Department for a postponement, making it likely that the previous proposal will be withdrawn.

### Jiangyin

Civilian Run Over and Killed on Zhencheng Road

Between Shengang and Yumen on Zhencheng Road, at around 8 AM on the 29th, a privately owned car, Jing City No. 289 belonging to Zhai Weifu, traveling from Cheng, struck and knocked down Gu Jingui, a resident of Xiahu Township, severing his left foot and right hand, resulting in his immediate death. The car was subsequently impounded at Wujin Station, and the driver, Zhang Rongsheng, was detained by the police. On the 31st, the 7th District Office petitioned the county to take custody of the case and bring it back to Cheng County for investigation.

South Gate Conscripts Disobey Training

In the South Gate Town of the 1st District, conscripts are currently being trained and taught literacy. The day before yesterday (the 29th), several conscripts disobeyed the instructions of the trainer, Zhang Wenming, leading to a beating. The conscripts, refusing to accept this, went en masse to the county government to petition. County Head Yuan reprimanded them, and they dispersed.

### Nantong

Meeting of Nantong County Heads

The Special Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of county heads from all counties under Nantong on the 30th. Deputies from the county security brigades also attended. First, the issue of the security team's structure was discussed. Subsequently, three resolutions were adopted: ㊀ As the district's opium suppression work was completed several months ahead of schedule, additional inspectors will be added, and each county will be divided into zones to suppress opium, with the Special Commissioner's Office drafting implementation guidelines to be submitted to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation. ㊁ The organization of the conscript teams will be strengthened, with a decision made to select discharged soldiers, provide them with training, and assign them as deputy leaders of township militia conscript teams. ㊂ The people will be encouraged to purchase firearms for self-defense, with the district security command contacting the Ministry of Military Affairs to negotiate firearm prices. Meanwhile, the county government will conduct investigations and registrations.

### Dinghai

Competition Leads to Fatal Incident

In Maoyang, Beichan, Dazhan, Wuxie, and other places in Dinghai, there is a tradition of holding deity welcoming competitions during the second month of the lunar calendar. This practice is costly, wastes money, and is prone to causing trouble. The authorities have advised against it, but starting on the 27th, it was held again as usual. A conflict arose during the competition to carry the deity's seat, leading to a brawl. As a result, one person from Zhuangjia Village was seriously injured and died, with several people injured on both sides. Subsequently, the Shenjiamen Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched police officers to suppress the incident. The local court also sent personnel to conduct an inspection.

### Ningbo

News of the Renovation of the New Jiang Bridge

Since the old Jiang Bridge in this city was renovated, transportation has been convenient. However, the New Jiang Bridge, which traverses Jiangbei, is a crucial passage across the Yong River. Tens of thousands of people pass through it every day. Various sectors, for the sake of convenient transportation, also intend to renovate it. Last year, they jointly discussed the renovation with fellow Ningbo natives in Shanghai, naming it the Zhongzheng Bridge and organizing a New Jiang Bridge Renovation Committee, assigning personnel to be responsible for carrying it out. However, the estimated cost is about 700,000 yuan. With the Ling Bridge having been completed entirely through local fundraising, further fundraising is proving to be difficult. They now plan to petition the Provincial Government to approve an allocation of 200,000 yuan to help with the construction. Meanwhile, they are also raising funds, hoping to see it completed soon. It is also reported that Wang Haonan, the Ningbo Garrison Commander, also feels that the New Jiang Bridge cannot withstand the weight and that transportation is extremely inconvenient. He also plans to petition the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Administration to order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allocate funds for construction.

### Shanghai Zhonghua Basketball Team Preparing to Dominate the National Games Will Embark on Eastern Expedition

Entrusting the National Sports Association to Handle Competition Arrangements; Departure Date to Be Determined Later; Total Team of Eleven

Although this year's Shanghai Zhonghua Basketball Team failed to defeat the United States to win the international championship, fulfilling a long-held dream, its technical standards are indeed higher than in the past. Its players are of above-average skill, its organization is tight-knit, and it can be considered the best in the country at present. After the international competition ended, it maintained its spirit of unity and continued to strive for progress in basketball skills, hoping to bring a different kind of glory to the long-declining Shanghai basketball scene. It has competed in Beijing twice, playing a total of four games. Except for the first time, when it unfortunately lost to the Military Academy due to the absence of Feng Nianhua, it defeated the Military Academy in the second and third games, avenging its first defeat. Finally, it also defeated the nationally renowned amateur team by a large margin, attracting enthusiastic attention from the national basketball community. The amateur team was the former Nankai Five Tigers, and also the national champions of 1933. Now, it dominates Beijing and Shanghai. A month ago, it also swept away all the strong teams in Tianjin in the name of the National Sports Team. Yet, it was not enough to match the Zhonghua Team's brilliance. No wonder the two giants of the Nanjing basketball community, the Military Academy and the amateur team, are eager to jointly organize, hoping to compete with the Shanghai team in this year's National Games.

The Shanghai Basketball Committee, in light of this, believes that there must be concrete measures for the future training of the Zhonghua Team in order to win the National Games championship, which it has never won. Therefore, it convened a meeting the night before last (the 20th) and decided to send the Shanghai Zhonghua Basketball Team to Kobe and Tokyo, Japan, for competitions to deepen their skills. First, a letter will be sent to the National Sports Association for approval, and the association will be asked to introduce the team to the Japanese sports authorities and arrange competition matters. Then, the departure date will be determined. The list of players and staff going to Japan has also been selected as follows: Coach Li Baojun, Manager Shen Kunnan, Players Wang Nanzhen (Captain), Cai Yanxiong, Kuang Yaoya, Yin Guiren, Han Zhenyuan, Feng Nianhua, Zhou Dayun, Chen Zongqi, Chen Xianglong.

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, March 31) The National Art Exhibition began at 8 AM on the 31st, hosting officials from various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions, as well as foreign guests and people from the news and art communities. Attendance was very enthusiastic, including Chen Lifu, He Yingqin, Chen Guofu, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Qun, Chen Shuren, Wang Boqun, Gan Naikwang, Gu Zhenggang, Wu Zhongxin, Wang Shuchang, Liu Ruiheng, Zhou Qigang, Luo Jialun, Liang Hancao, Gu Zhengding, Gu Zhenglun, Jiang Zuobin, Wang Shijie, Chen Daqi, Peng Xuepei, Xiao Zhongzhen, Xu Chonghao, Pu Dong, Cheng Tiangu, Fang Qia, Di Ying, Wang Zizhuang, Zou Lin, Xu Mo, Qin Fen, Xiao Jishan, Hong Ludong, Wu Yifeng, Wang Gupan, Tao Luqian, Fu Sinian, Teng Baiye, Li Yishi, and foreign guests such as German Ambassador Trautmann and personnel from various embassies and consulates in China, as well as several thousand people from the news media and other sectors. The road was busy with traffic all day, and the venue was crowded with people, but the order was very well maintained. The viewers gradually left until late in the evening. The exhibition officially opens to the public on the 1st. Additional exhibits continue to arrive and be displayed, including the Han Zhang Cao and Lishu Jian Ce in their original packaging, collected by the Northwest Scientific Expedition Team, which are unique treasures in the country. Also, Chen Shouren's ivory carving of Premier Sun Yat-sen from eastern Yunnan, which recorded the declarations of the Xingzhonghui and the north-bound declaration, as well as the will, in full text of more than 12,400 words, on a three-inch square ivory surface, was praised by the viewers as divine craftsmanship. Finally, the official statistics of the exhibits totaled 2,084 pieces, excluding the Yin Ruins excavations of the Academia Sinica.

### Chen Lijiang Discusses the Significance of the Art Exhibition

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, March 31) Chen Lijiang, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, spoke on the 31st about the significance of this year's art exhibition, which lies in inspiring the general public's interest in art and promoting their aesthetic ability, so that art appreciation can be popularized among the entire society. This session occupies a very important position within the scope of social education, because social education on the one hand provides basic national education to the out-of-school masses, and on the other hand, it focuses on providing the general public with opportunities for spiritual cultivation. The enhancement of national morality depends on this. In the past, art was only for the enjoyment of a few people in society, but today it has become an important facility for social education. It is hoped that it can be held in rotation in the central government and various provinces and cities in the future, so that aesthetic education can be popularized throughout the country, thereby promoting national rejuvenation.

### A Record of Visiting the Art Exhibition Yesterday

The Ministry of Education's Second National Art Exhibition is scheduled to officially open at 9 AM on April 1st at the National Art Exhibition Hall on Guofu Road in the capital. Yesterday (the 31st) was the date for inviting people from all walks of life to visit. The entrance for visitors was at the gate of the National Academy of Drama and Music. Inside the gate were the hall's general floor plan and rules for visitors. Ascending the stairs to the left was the first exhibition room. Various valuable photographs were hung on both walls of the room's corridor, including masterpieces by Zhong Shan Yin, Feng Sizhi, Lang Jingshan, and Huang Jie. Inside the room were the most valuable Han Dynasty wooden slips. These wooden slips were transported from Ping to the capital by Mr. Fu Sinian for display. These wooden slips were discovered in the desert. Because the desert soil is dry, they have not decayed for more than a thousand years. In addition, there were many valuable ancient books, which were exhibited by the Palace Museum, the Peking Library, the Central Library, the Guoxue Library, and Mr. Zhu Xizu, such as handwritten copies of the Siku Quanshu, with neat handwriting and beautiful binding. There was also a rare embroidery of the entire Diamond Sutra. Before the books was the printing department, with various printing manuals. Returning to the second exhibition room was the art and crafts department, which displayed ancient bronzes, ceramics, jade, lacquerware, patterns, etc. The bronzes and porcelains sent by the Palace Museum for display were all items that had not been exhibited in Shanghai before. In particular, the Song Hu from the Ancient Relics Exhibition Hall was the most popular. Also, the ivory carving of Premier Sun Yat-sen produced by Chen Shouren was engraved with fine characters to form the Premier's image. When viewed through a magnifying glass, each stroke was clear, truly a divine craftsmanship. Passing this person to the third exhibition room, the antiquities of the Academia Sinica were dazzling. Most of them were relics from the Yin Dynasty, which were unearthed in Houjiazhuang, Anyang, between September 1934 and December 1936. Houjiazhuang was the remains of the Yin Dynasty tombs. Among the tombs that were excavated were various stone inscriptions, Yin people's decorations, oracle bones, bronze tripods, spears, pottery, etc., which were all rare objects. Going downstairs to the fourth exhibition room of the National Art Museum, there were architectural drawings and models, such as small residential design drawings for Shanghai and Singapore, which were very delicate and beautiful, and quite suitable for the needs of ordinary families. Among the sculptures, the likeness of Ma Xiangbo was the most vivid. There were many exhibits in the Western painting department, including works by Liu Haisu and Xu Beihong. Wu Yeshan's painting of white pigeons and the lacquer painting of Su Wu herding sheep were outstanding works. Ascending the stairs to the fifth exhibition room, which displayed modern calligraphy and painting, almost all the names of modern calligraphy and painting had works on display, which could be called dazzling and beautiful. He Haixia's "Trees and Flying Springs," Liu Haisu's "Five Doctors," Pan Tianshou's cursive script, Zhang Shanzi's blue-green landscape figures, Yang Xuejiu's "Watching the Waterfall," and Xu Beiming's "Village Song" could all follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and add color to the exhibition. Ascending the stairs again to the sixth exhibition room, which displayed calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties, including masterpieces from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing, and recent periods, almost all were collected, such as Jin Qian Xizhi's "Quick Snow Clear Sky Post Album," Tang Chu Suiliang's "Erzhi Zhuan Zan," Tang Yan Zhenxiang's "Sacrifice to Nephew Wen Gao Scroll," Five Dynasties Jing Hao's "Mount Lu Picture," Song Fu Cheng's "Cold River Fishing Boat," Song People's "Earning Lanting Picture," Yuan Zhao Mengfu's "Dead Wood and Bamboo Stone," Ming Dai Jin's landscape, Qing Wang Shimin's imitation of Dachishallow red landscape, all works that are not easily seen by outsiders. Also, Shitao's landscapes, several of which were hung in this room. There were many exhibits in this exhibition, too many to record in detail, so I will only record the general outline.

### Detailed Reasons Why Textbook Prices Cannot Be Reduced by the Booksellers' Guild

Yesterday, various newspapers published documents concerning the Municipal Education Association's campaign to reduce textbook prices. We have investigated with the Booksellers' Guild, and they stated that they received a document from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau forwarding the Municipal Education Association's petition on this matter. They have already submitted a detailed response outlining the reasons why prices cannot be reduced. We have obtained a copy of their response, which is included below:

Regarding the matter of submitting a reply in compliance with instructions: Our guild received Instruction No. 6-07 from your bureau on March 24th, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Education Association had submitted a petition arguing for the reduction of textbook prices and instructing the guild to investigate and report back, so that the matter could be forwarded to the Ministry of Education. We have already submitted a document on March 6th, detailing the reasons why textbook prices cannot be further reduced due to soaring paper and raw material costs, in response to a previous instruction from your bureau, forwarded from the Ministry of Education, to re-examine and reduce textbook prices. Now, we respectfully address each point raised by the Shanghai Municipal Education Association, as follows:

㊀ Textbook Prices

Upon reviewing the Education Association's petition, the first point states: "Textbooks are tools for popularizing education, and should not be raised in price during this time of eradicating illiteracy." However, the textbooks sold by the member bookstores of our guild, since receiving the Ministry of Education's unified sales method for books, have all complied with the order to set actual prices based on the original discounts and have reported the actual prices of each book to the Ministry of Education for record. There have been no increases in textbook prices. The Education Association's claim of price increases is completely inconsistent with the facts.

㊁ Ministry Orders

The first point in the petition states: "In February of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the Ministry of Education issued an order to all bookstores to abolish markups and sell at actual prices, reducing prices according to cost to ease the burden on students' parents. The bookstores published the Ministry's order in newspapers (around May of the 24th year of the Republic (1935)) and claimed to comply with it. Little did they know that booksellers only followed the first half of the order, reducing commissions, while forgetting the second half, turning the Ministry of Education's order into a talisman for disguised price increases." According to our guild, regarding the matter of selling textbooks and other books at actual prices, the Ministry of Education only issued the "Unified Sales Method for Textbooks and Other Books" and no other order. The guild published this method in major Shanghai newspapers in June of the 25th year of the Republic (1936). Article 4 of this method stipulates that books published with high prices due to original discounts should be reduced by the publisher to set a new actual price, marked on the cover. Future increases or decreases in paper prices or other reasons allowing publishers to adjust prices, but retail sales must be at the finally adjusted price, with no discounts or increases. If it is a textbook, it should be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval at any time. Our member bookstores have all complied with the order to reduce discounted books and sell them at actual prices. And have also appropriately reduced the price of books without discounts, to serve the Ministry of Education's promotion of culture. Textbook prices have always been the lowest compared to the prices in other countries. Since the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), due to low paper prices and fierce competition among the industry, primary school textbooks were sold at 60% of the list price, and secondary school textbooks were sold at 80% of the list price. After receiving the method from the Ministry of Education last April, we immediately complied with the order to abolish discounts and sell at actual prices. Unexpectedly, shortly after the price change, paper prices soared, more than doubling. According to the method issued by the Ministry, when paper prices rise, book prices can be increased, but considering that books are an important tool for education, we were unwilling to increase prices unless absolutely necessary, to avoid increasing the burden on students' families. The Education Association claims that bookstores issuing textbooks have turned the Ministry of Education's order into a talisman for disguised price increases, which is far from the truth. The list of commissions states that the old commission rate was at most 40% and usually 20%. The new commission rate is 15% for local businesses and 25% for businesses outside the city, also inconsistent with the facts. The commissions given to retailers by the member bookstores of our guild have mostly been between 10% and 20%. We have commission tables from before as proof. A minority have commissions as high as around 20%. The reasons for this are twofold: first, smaller businesses receive a slightly higher commission. The other is paying a small number of special sales agent companies cannot be seen as applying to the entire group. Since the commission was written into the guild rules, previously a commission slightly higher than the industry rules, then should be slightly reduced, and a commission lower than the industry rules, then should be increased, in order to achieve the same. Therefore, from the overall point of view, there is actually very little difference between the new and old commission.

㊂ The Cost of Textbooks

According to the third point in the Education Association's petition, the cost of textbooks is quite low. The cost of the third volume of the elementary school language textbook published by the Shijie Book Company is only 1.8 cents per copy, and the cost of the third volume of the junior high school language textbook published by the Commercial Press is only 12.72 cents per copy. The calculation of the cost by them has too many extremes, which will be discussed later. Now, we will analyze the cost they claim, which is full of errors. We will select particularly obvious examples as follows:

㊀ Paper: In printing, it is common practice to add a certain number of waste sheets for every thousand sheets printed, to compensate for various losses in printing, commonly known as "rising heads." This paper should be included in the cost, but the Association only calculates the cost based on the number of pages in the book, which is error one.

㊁ Paper Prices: Currently, the price of 45-pound newsprint is about $5.40 per ream, and the price of 70-pound domestic Daolin paper is about $17 per ream, but the Association claims that the current market price is $5 per ream for the former and $14 per ream for the latter, which is error two.

㊂ Printing Costs: According to the Shijie Book Company and the Commercial Press, the cost of printing textbooks is at least $1.50 per ream. Small printing shops outside may charge only 80 cents per ream during normal times because they do not comply with factory laws, pay lower wages, and have longer working hours and simple equipment. But since the Printing Trade Association published a notice on February 16 of this year, increasing prices by 50% based on the original prices, the printing cost per ream is also $1.20. The Association claims that the printing cost per ream is only 80 cents, which is error three.

㊂ Editing Fees: The Association claims that based on 5,000 copies, the editing and advertising fee for each copy of the third volume of the junior high school Chinese textbook published by the Commercial Press is only 2 cents. This means that the total editing and advertising fee for the book is only $10, or an average of only $5, which is tens or hundreds of times different from the facts, which is error four.

㊄ Selling Prices: The original price of the third volume of the junior high school Chinese textbook published by the Commercial Press was 90 cents, but has long been changed to sell at the actual price of 72 cents. The Association claims that the actual selling price of the book is 81 cents per copy, which is error five.

The above is only a brief analysis of the cost claimed by the Association, only one part of it, but there are already many errors. We will now explain the items omitted from the cost of textbooks by the Association as follows:

㊀ Losses from Obsolete Books: The Ministry of Education's revised regulations for the review of textbooks stipulate that primary school books must be reviewed every four years and secondary school books every three years. After the review, newly approved books should be printed. All old books already printed must be cut and destroyed. According to reports from major bookstores, the number of books cut and destroyed is approximately equal to the number of books sold in a year. Calculated on an annual average basis, each 100 copies of primary and secondary school books will lose 25 books. In other words, each book's cost must be increased by 25%. The cost calculated by the Association does not include this item, which is omission one.

㊁ Commissions and Accounts Receivable: The Association knows that the books sold by the book industry to retailers have a commission rate, each book can only receive 85% to 75% of the actual selling price. In addition, there are losses from accounts receivable. The larger the business, the larger the accounts receivable. The accounts receivable of each bookstore are almost equal to its annual sales. Bad debts are very large. The association also did not take this into account, which is omission two.

㊂ Management Fees: The cost calculated by the Association only lists advertising fees, in addition to direct costs. But in fact, there are various management fees, such as expenses for improving textbooks, expenses for setting up fixed editorial bodies, expenses for establishing distribution agencies, expenses for managing accounts, expenses for setting up accounting bodies, and expenses for establishing warehouse agency bodies for supplying goods. In addition, there are various taxes, debt interest, and other expenses. All of these require funds. The annual management expenses of major bookstores account for 20% to 30% of the total annual sales. The association is not very clear. This is omission three.

㊃ Paper: The Association only knows that the paper used to print books should be included in the cost, but does not know that a large amount of paper must be stored for continuous printing. The amount of paper that must be stored annually for printing textbooks is equal to the number of textbooks sold in a year, that is, at least two copies of paper must be prepared for each textbook. The interest, warehouse rent, and insurance for the spare copy of paper are all considerable expenses. This is omission four.

㊄ Inventory: No business can exist without inventory. For those engaged in textbooks in the book industry, the necessary inventory is particularly large. The inventory of textbooks must be three times the number sold. Assuming that the total annual sales are 100 points, the total inventory is 300 points. Among them, 100 points are the inventory of the head office, 100 points are the inventory of the branch offices, and 100 points are the inventory in transit. China is vast, and transportation is extremely difficult. It takes months to transport goods from Shanghai to the border areas, or even more than half a year. Therefore, the branch offices and the goods in transit must be stocked with one year's worth, or there will be a shortage of books. The interest, warehouse rent, and insurance for these two copies of textbooks are also considerable expenses. The cost calculated by the Association only lists one copy. This is omission five.

㊅ Other: In addition to the above five items, the major uncalculated costs include the depreciation of houses, machinery, and equipment, damage from insects and rodents, and losses in transit. When calculated together, the number is also considerable. There are many things like this. The cost calculated by the Association lacks all of these. This is omission six.

Looking at the above sections, it can be seen that the cost calculated by the Association is not only full of errors and cannot justify itself, but also full of omissions. The so-called cost is only a part of the direct cost. The members of the Association are all engaged in education, and they may not be fully aware of business conditions. It is expected that their calculations will have omissions and errors. The contents of the Ministry-compiled textbooks and the literacy textbooks compiled by the Municipal Government are completely inconsistent with what the Association described. There are records for government, which there is no need to argue. In short, paper and ink are the main raw materials for the book industry, and wages and expenses are the main consumption of the book industry. If paper prices are high, the book industry cannot reduce costs, and the selling price cannot be reduced. Among the members of the Guild, there are about ten who are involved in textbooks, and about two-fifths of them are struggling to support themselves and unable to issue dividends. Now the prices of paper, ink, lead, antimony, and all items have risen sharply. The book industry is one of the commercial industries. Since the cost has increased, the price should increase. How can it be reduced again? The bureau responsible for educational work, should be very clear about the various situation. The guild believes that peers must first try to maintain survival, to make a contribution to education and culture. The education community misunderstands the situation, but wants to order the price reduction. Look ahead to the future of the book industry, the danger is extreme. We are presenting the situation of being unable to reduce the price of textbooks. (End)

### Overview of the Journalism Department of the Central Political School

Chinese journalism education has been developing gradually in recent years, and the establishment of the Journalism Department at the Central Political School is an unprecedented example in national universities. The Central Political School is directly under the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party. It has a large scale, with a university department, three colleges of land administration, political science and cooperation, schools for Mongolia, Tibet, Xikang, Baotou, Suzhou, Qinghai and other branch schools, a research department, and affiliated employment training classes. It has a history of ten years. The Journalism Department is one of the seven departments of the university department of the school. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is the president of the school. Mr. Chiang has always been very concerned about the Chinese press. In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), he sent students to the United States to study journalism. In the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the Department of Diplomacy of the school set up a journalism course, which was a required course for students of the Department of Diplomacy. It was taught by Mr. Ma Xingye.

In the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the Central Plenary Session, based on the resolutions of previous central news conferences and the proposals of the Central Propaganda Committee, decided to establish a journalism department in the Central Political School. Ma Xingye was responsible for the preparation. In the spring of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the students who selected journalism were very enthusiastic. In the fall of the same year, the Journalism Department was formally established, with eleven students in the third grade and eight students in the second grade, all of whom transferred from other departments. In the fall of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the journalism students included more than 40 students in the first, second, third and fourth grades. Only the students in the first grade studied general subjects. In April of this year, ten students in the fourth grade completed their studies and will be sent to various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai for a three-month internship before graduating. This is the history of the establishment of the Journalism Department of the Central Political School.

The department's educational policy emphasizes both theory and practice. The curriculum is divided into three parts: social sciences, language and writing, and journalism. In addition to classroom teaching, reading, and other methods, students are given opportunities to practice at any time. The first grade is for preparatory education, and students study political science, economics, English, Chinese, Chinese history, and Western history. The courses for the second, third, and fourth grades in the social sciences include Chinese political history, Chinese political thought, Chinese diplomatic history, modern political issues, international relations and organization, international law, Western diplomatic history, comparative government, civil law, criminal law, public finance, modern economic issues, sociology, social psychology, and modern social issues. In terms of language and writing, in addition to English and Chinese, there are also Japanese, essays, narratives, and stenography. In terms of journalism, the second grade has an introduction to journalism and a course on writing. The third grade has courses in interviewing and editing, editorials, newspaper business, and advertising. The fourth grade has courses in magazine writing, journalism history, comparative journalism, printing, and special research, as well as lectures on practical issues. All of these are required courses. The distribution of courses is such that social sciences account for the most, about one-half, while language and writing and journalism each account for one-quarter.

According to the person in charge of the department, journalism education is quite different from law, politics, and other educations, so the points to pay attention to are also different. First, the knowledge required for entering the news media is extremely extensive. Among the encyclopedias, few can't be applied to newspaper work. Therefore, the establishment of a journalism department in a university should make full use of the disciplines and teachers of other departments, especially economics, finance, politics, and law. Second, journalism is still in its infancy. Although the establishment of journalism departments in universities is very common in the United States and Germany, there is often a great lack of teachers and teaching materials. The experience aspect is more important than theory. Therefore, the journalism department should make full use of the specialists who actually serve in newspapers, take on teaching tasks, and integrate the school and the newspaper into one. Third, the responsibility of the press career is heavy and the work is hard. Without a healthy physique and a noble character, it is impossible to do this. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the physical and moral education of students. The Central Political School has strict training. Most of the teachers it recruits are famous social scientists. The journalism department is actively cooperating with well-established domestic newspapers. Many of the teachers also hold important positions in major newspapers in Shanghai. If it can develop positively in this way, it will surely be a sight to behold in the future.

As for the department's equipment, it is also being actively expanded. The department now has its own printing press, with two flatbed printing machines, one engine, a lithographic printing machine, a cutting machine, a typesetting machine, a type casting machine, No. 4 and 5 type copper molds, etc. A journalism research room has been set up, and domestic newspapers and magazines have been prepared. Several important newspapers from London, New York, Tokyo, Moscow, and dozens of world-famous magazines have been subscribed to and will continue to be subscribed to. Indexes of various newspapers and magazines are also available for reference. Books on journalism have also been purchased and are complete. The school has a complete library of books on social sciences for its use. At the time of its establishment, the department began to prepare a Chinese and foreign monthly magazine for students to practice writing. All work, from writing, editing, illustrating, proofreading, and publishing to business, is completely the responsibility of the students. The Chinese and foreign monthly magazine was published in December of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) and has continued to be published. It has now published two volumes and three issues. Its circulation has increased to 5,000 and is very popular among readers. In addition to supplying the monthly magazine, students also contribute articles to newspapers and magazines in Beijing and Shanghai. It is heard that the department plans to run a daily newspaper, following the example of the Journalism School of the University of Missouri in the United States, so that the school and the newspaper are integrated.

### Wu Tiecheng Yesterday Relinquished His Post as Shanghai Mayor

Yesterday Afternoon Tea Party Held to Bid Farewell to Various Circles, Expressing Heartfelt Words in Farewell Address to Citizens, Departure for Guangdong Postponed for a Few Days

Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the Shanghai Mayor, has been transferred to the position of Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. Mr. Wu officially handed over his duties yesterday (the 31st), and Secretary-General Yu will act as his agent starting today. Mr. Wu took the night train to Nanjing at 11 p.m. last night to bid farewell to various central government officials, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.

Date for Taking Up New Post in Guangdong Confirmed. Mayor Wu handed over his duties as Shanghai Mayor yesterday and held a tea party at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 4 p.m., inviting Chinese and foreign guests to bid farewell and chat for a while. Carriages and horses filled the road, making it extremely lively. A reporter from the Central News Agency also attended the event and took the opportunity to inquire about the exact date of the Mayor's departure to take up his new post in Guangdong from key officials of the Municipal Government. According to reports, after handing over his duties today, the Mayor will take the night train to Nanjing to report to the Central Government and arrange for taking office in Guangdong. The initial date was set for April 2, to travel south on the Italian ship "Victoria" and escort Special Envoy Kong to Hong Kong on the same ship. However, as the ship's schedule on the 2nd is very tight and the round trip between Nanjing and Shanghai takes time, it is feared that it will be difficult to catch up. In addition, the continuous completion of various handled events over the past six years has been overwhelming and exhausting. It is planned to postpone the departure for a few days and choose the nearest ship schedule after the 2nd. It is heard that Secretary Sun Pu and Section Chief Li Dachao will be sent to Guangdong on the President Jackson on the 1st to take care of everything in advance.

Another report states that on this trip to Guangdong, Li Dachao, Section Chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, and Wu Zixiang, Director of the Municipal Treasury, will accompany him. Li and Wu have resigned from their positions at the Municipal Government. It is now heard that Acting Mayor Yu has appointed the original Secretary Wang Shaozhai to temporarily serve as the Section Chief of the First Section, and the original Secretary and Section Chief of the Second Section Guo Shen to temporarily serve as the Director of the Municipal Treasury. All other original personnel remain unchanged.

Bidding Farewell to All Circles. Mayor Wu held a tea party in the Municipal Government Auditorium from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. yesterday to bid farewell to people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign. Envoys from Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Poland, Charges d'affaires from Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, and Chile, commercial attachés, military attachés, consuls from various countries, heads of various agencies, leaders from all circles, the press, the education sector, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Zhou Jue, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Yi, Xu PeiHuang, Xu Jinyuan, Wang Zhinan, Lin Jinyu, Luo Qinghua, Zheng Binzhao, Bei Songsun, Zhou Zuomin, Lin Kanghou, Ma Yinliang, Wang Boqi, Hu Zhengzhi, Jiang Guangtang, Zeng Xubai, Feng Youzhen, Dong XianGuang, Wu Zhongyi, Liu Zhanen, Zhu Shaoping, Zhu Qinglan, Wang Binyan, Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Cheng Yanqiu, Yang GuangSheng, Guo Dehua, Zheng Yuxiu, Mrs. Wang Chonghui, Mrs. Zhu Lihe, and senior staff from various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government, totaling more than 600 people, attended. At that time, Mayor Wu, Acting Mayor Yu and his wife stood at the entrance of the auditorium, greeting guests into the auditorium, shaking hands and exchanging greetings one by one. Commissioners Wang Changchun, Secretaries Zhang Tingrong, Geng Jiaji, Tang Shixuan, Wang Shaozhai, and Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government were responsible for receiving guests, serving tea and refreshments to all guests, and entertaining them with music. The gathering concluded happily at around 6 p.m.

Farewell Address to the Citizens. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city, due to an appointment from the Central Government, has been transferred to the position of Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and will soon leave Shanghai to take office in Guangdong. Before his departure, he specially issued a farewell address to the citizens, saying: "I, Tiecheng, with meager talent, have been entrusted with the responsibility of serving this city. Time flies, and suddenly more than five years have passed. Now, due to an order to be transferred to Guangdong to serve my hometown, I must temporarily bid farewell to the city of Shanghai, which is like my second hometown, and its 3.5 million beloved citizens. Humans are emotional animals, and as I embark on this journey, recalling the past few years, I am deeply grateful for the assistance and cooperation of local talents and friends from friendly countries, and the affection shown to me. My feelings of reluctance to part are overwhelming. Therefore, I sincerely express my feelings: 1. When I, Tiecheng, received the mandate from the Party and the country, it was the autumn season of the Shanghai Incident. I勉竭愚忠, responded to the arduous task, relying heavily on the concerted efforts of all parties to successfully overcome the difficult situation. However, due to the severe damage and the depletion of vitality, during this difficult and arduous process, all plans ultimately failed to be effectively implemented. My heart was more than my strength, and things went against my wishes. Not only was the ideal of building a Great Shanghai far from being achieved, but also the general municipal facilities that should have been in place failed to fully meet the ardent expectations of the citizens. Reflecting on my duties, I am deeply remorseful. 2. Over the past few years, I, Tiecheng, have externally observed the trends of modern politics and internally examined the needs of the masses of people. In particular, the ideals of revolution and construction of our Party all aim at democracy. Therefore, I have promoted the idea of social construction in the hope of slightly improving the welfare of the citizens. Hence, the promotion of the literacy education movement, the construction of civilian new villages, the improvement of health administration, and the organization of other civilian welfare undertakings. Although there have been some efforts and suggestions, they are far from the original expectations. Thinking of the suffering of the people, I am ashamed of not fulfilling my duties. My feelings of trepidation cannot be suppressed. 3. The transformation of old Shanghai is the established plan of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and the construction of a Great Shanghai is even more sufficient to demonstrate the ability of our nation to create culture. Since the opening of Shanghai as a port, its form has become increasingly prosperous, but in essence, it has not only failed to contribute to the progress of national culture, but has also had a negative impact on national customs and the national spirit. I, Tiecheng, deeply concerned about this, once earnestly told my citizens when the new municipal building in the city center was completed, 'Our compatriots should not merely take pleasure in relying on Europeanization or feel safe living in concessions. Why not think about the crisis of our nation, revive our spirit of creating culture, seek to improve our lives, and open up a garden for prosperity and development to establish a foundation for the development of our nation? Whether a Great Shanghai can develop is not merely a problem of a single city, but a test of whether our entire Chinese nation can create culture, can be self-reliant, and can get rid of its inferior qualities of following the old ways, relying on others, stealing comfort, and enjoying pleasure.' However, the construction of a Great Shanghai is a great undertaking for centuries to come, and the existing construction is only a drop in the ocean. Looking ahead, the road is long and the task is heavy. How to complete the original plan and realize future ideals still depends on the continued assistance of the citizens. Only then will the Chinese nation have a chance to revive. In the future, the work of nation-building will be even more arduous. The people of the whole country should first work together regardless of regional boundaries to complete this great historical task. Provinces and cities are all part of the entire nation, and their construction projects and development achievements are all factors that contribute to national strength. Therefore, although I, Tiecheng, am leaving Shanghai for Guangdong, my service to the country is the same. I hope that my future efforts can slightly make up for past shortcomings. If all the local talents can continue to assist me, I will be extremely fortunate. As I leave in haste, my feelings are immense. I have hurriedly expressed my thoughts, but much remains unsaid. I earnestly hope that you will all understand."

### Mayor Wu and Others Inspect Troops

Wu Instructs to Never Forget One's Own Responsibilities, Commander Yang and Acting Mayor Yu Also Encourage

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, the Security General Regiment, and the Civil Training Office, to bid farewell to Mayor Wu's departure to govern Guangdong, specially invited Mr. Wu to the Longhua Airport at 9 a.m. yesterday (the 31st) to give a speech and hold a military parade. The details are as follows:

Inspection Details. The inspection ceremony was attended by Inspection Officer Mayor Wu, Commander Yang, Acting Mayor Yu, Accompanying Inspection Officers Cai Jingjun, Jiang Huaishu, and Li Lvqi, Commander-in-Chief Ji Zhangjian, Commanders Yue Cen and Tao Yishan, Liao Jiongran, Chief Receptionist Su Liping, Wang Dashui, Master of Ceremonies Yu Pu, Guests Central Committee Member Xiao Tongzi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Public Works Bureau Shen Junyi, Xu Peihuang of the Public Utilities Bureau, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association Lin Kanghou, President of Jinan University He Bingsong (represented by Chen Zhongfu), Zhong Yuting and Chen Shixia of the Chinese Team of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, Section Chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government Li Dachao, Secretary Wang Shaozhai, Deputy Curator of the Municipal Gazetteer Zhu Shaoping, and Zhu Shaolan, Lu Bohong, Wu Gonghu, and others totaling more than 100 people. The military parade began at 9 a.m. Amidst the military music, Mayor Wu, Commander Yang, and Acting Mayor Yu, accompanied by the inspection officers and guests, stepped down from the platform and inspected the troops for a week. When the inspection officer passed the troops, all officers and soldiers of the team saluted and the military music was played. After the inspection, they returned to the reviewing stand. After the military parade, a divisional parade was followed. The inspection officers, accompanying inspection officers, and guests all stood in front of the reviewing stand to inspect the various teams.

Wu's Instructions. After the inspection, Mayor Wu gave instructions, briefly stating, "I have been ordered to be transferred to Guangdong, and I feel reluctant to part with the officers and soldiers who have shared hardships with me. The significance of today's inspection is to understand the results of daily training so as to report to the Central Government and report to the citizens. This is also one of my ways of handing over duties. Shanghai is the economic center of our country and the largest commercial port. There are also many foreigners residing in Shanghai from dozens of countries. Therefore, all officers and soldiers who are responsible for defense should be able to ensure the peace and tranquility of Shanghai and protect the safety of the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people. Although I will leave Shanghai, if the peace and tranquility of Shanghai is in danger, I can return to Shanghai and work together with all the officers and soldiers who are responsible for defense. I hope that all officers and soldiers will never forget their own responsibilities, etc."

Speeches by Yang and Yu. Then, Commander Yang gave instructions, briefly stating, "Today, we are bidding farewell to Mayor Wu's inspection of all the defense forces of Shanghai. I see that the officers and troops are neat and full of spirit. This is the elite force that Mayor Wu has painstakingly built over the years. We should strictly abide by Mayor Wu's wishes and promote Mayor Wu's spirit of serving the local area. I also congratulate Mayor Wu on his boundless happiness after taking office in his new post." Then, Acting Mayor Yu spoke, briefly stating, "Today's grand ceremony has great significance. The officers and soldiers who are inspected should understand that they are the force to protect local security, and understand that they have the responsibility to maintain security and ensure peace. Therefore, the following points must be noted: (1) The people should not usually feel the existence of the military and police, but feel the strength of the military and police to maintain security everywhere when something happens. (2) When the country is at peace, they should be the backing of the people; when something happens, they should be the vanguard of the people. (3) The teams inspected today include the Security General Regiment, the police, and the trained citizens. Each unit should work hard separately, and at the same time, they should find ways to contact and respond to each other. (4) All soldiers should fully understand that their salaries are the blood and sweat of the people, and they should never forget their responsibilities to the people."

Cai's Reply. Finally, Cai Jingjun gave a reply, briefly stating that Mayor Wu was transferred to the position of Chairman of Guangdong, and gave earnest instructions before leaving. We should understand our responsibilities, protect the local area, and bury ourselves in hard work and firmly implement Mayor Wu's instructions before leaving, so as not to fail Mayor Wu's painstaking efforts over the years and be unworthy of being Mayor Wu's subordinates. Then, he called out slogans, served refreshments, and the ceremony ended at noon.

Chanting Slogans in Unison: (1) Sincere unity, support the leader, (2) Military and police united, maintain security, (3) With one heart and one mind, consolidate unity, (4) Continue to build a Great Shanghai, (5) Accelerate the development of a new Guangdong, (6) Great Republic of China strives to be strong, (7) All people united, moving towards national rejuvenation, (8) Long live the Three Principles of the People, (9) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang, (10) Long live the Republic of China, (11) Long live Chairman Chiang, (12) Long live Mayor Wu.

### Various Groups Gave a Farewell Banquet for Mayor Wu Yesterday Afternoon

The Shanghai Municipal Party, the Garrison Headquarters, and various agencies and groups, totaling 46 units, held a joint farewell banquet at the New Asia Hotel at noon yesterday to celebrate Mayor Wu's glorious transfer to the chairmanship of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and also hosted a banquet for Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun. Attendees included Central Committee Member Chu Minyi, Xiao Tongzi, Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, Wu Kaixian, Tong Hangbai, and Tao Baichuan of the Municipal Party Department, Directors of various bureaus of the Municipal Government such as Pan Gongzhan, and representatives of various agencies and groups such as Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaxiang, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Yiting, Qian Xinzhi, Huang Renzhi, and Huang Boqiao, totaling more than 300 people.

Kong Xiangxi's Eulogy. Special Envoy Kong Xiangxi, who was dispatched to England to congratulate the British Emperor's coronation, also attended in his busy schedule and delivered a speech before the banquet, praising Mayor Wu's achievements in Shanghai, briefly stating that Mayor Wu has served as the Mayor of Great Shanghai for six years and has achieved remarkable results. He is now gloriously transferred to govern Guangdong, and he hopes that he will be able to return to Shanghai in the future. At that time, the scope of Great Shanghai will definitely be further expanded. Mayor Wu will serve as the Mayor of Great Shanghai, and I will warmly welcome him in the capacity of a citizen. The whole venue responded with applause for his good words and prayers. Kong left in a hurry after his speech because he had another banquet.

Pan Gongzhan's Speech. During the banquet, Pan Gongzhan presided over the event and delivered a farewell speech, briefly stating that today we are bidding farewell to Mayor Wu, and all the agencies and groups in Shanghai have unanimously participated, which also means that all the citizens of Shanghai are unanimously bidding farewell to Mayor Wu. It can be seen that Mayor Wu is deeply loved by the citizens. Mayor Wu has served in Shanghai for six or seven years. At the beginning of his tenure, he encountered the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Mayor Wu led 3 million citizens through the difficult situation and enabled Shanghai to gradually recover after the devastation. His achievements are truly indelible. During his tenure, Mayor Wu was almost always in hard work and hardship, truly exhausting his mind and body. The Central Government, due to Mayor Wu's great personality and obvious achievements, transferred him to govern Guangdong. This is a great loss for Shanghai to lose a wise and enlightened leader, but from a national perspective, it is also a congratulatory matter. Mayor Wu wishes Shanghai to be his second hometown. In his speech at the military parade this morning, he was extremely concerned about the peace and tranquility of Shanghai and said that if the peace and tranquility of Shanghai were to be in trouble, he would still come to Shanghai to lead the struggle. This is what 3 million citizens are looking forward to. Acting Mayor Yu has been working in Shanghai for ten years. Now that he has been ordered to act as the mayor, he will surely be able to handle the task with ease, follow the old rules, and create benefits for the citizens of Shanghai.

Mayor Wu's Reply. Then, Mayor Wu replied, briefly stating that he will be leaving Shanghai for Guangdong in the coming days. Having been with the citizens of Shanghai for six years, once we part, the mood of parting is naturally different from ordinary. In the future, I still hope that leaders from all circles and all the citizens of the city will continue to support and continue to work hard in the spirit of the past.

Yu Hongjun's Reply. Briefly stated that the various groups in Shanghai are bidding farewell to Mayor Wu's glorious return to Guangdong to govern, and I am honored to be invited to participate. As for hosting a banquet for me, I dare not accept it. Mayor Wu has governed Shanghai for five or six years, and his noble personality and far-sighted vision are well known to all citizens. However, Mayor Wu's spirit of enduring and sacrificing for the Party and the country is what I, who have been with Mayor Wu for a long time, know best. The Shanghai Incident of January 28th and last year's disputes can be used as evidence of Mayor Wu's painstaking efforts and careful handling. During his tenure in Shanghai, Mayor Wu has always adhered to three principles: (1) The policy should always be to enable the Central Government's policies to mobilize the local area, and not to allow local events to affect the Central Government's policies. (2) Rather sacrifice one's own life than maintain the dignity of the country and protect the safety of the people. (3) Rather sacrifice the interests of a few people than maintain the welfare of the majority of people. This spirit is truly worthy of emulation by those who come later. I have been ordered to temporarily act as mayor, and I deeply feel that my virtue and prestige are not sufficient, and my talent and learning are inadequate. I am extremely terrified. Fortunately, this is a temporary situation, and someone will take over soon. However, I do not have the idea of ​​being a five-day mayor. I will work hard for one hour while I am in office, and handle affairs according to the true public opinion. I still hope that leaders from all walks of life will guide me.

Commemorating the Blessing. After Yu's reply, Chairman Pan Gongzhan proposed to build a monument in the city center to commemorate Mayor Wu's achievements. The entire audience applauded and passed the proposal, but Mayor Wu stood up and strongly declined. Finally, Wang Xiaolai, on behalf of all the citizens of the city, pleaded with Mayor Wu not to decline again. At about 3 p.m., the guests and hosts happily dispersed.

### Rice Merchants Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities Petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday

Wang Xiaolai and Gu Xinyi Visited Xu Kan, Stating the Inappropriateness of Waiving Tax on Guangdong Rice

Rice merchants representatives from various provinces and cities, who went to Beijing to petition against the duty-free import of foreign rice to Guangdong, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. In the morning, the representatives went to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition. In the afternoon, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, along with Gu Xinyi, a representative of the rice merchants, took a letter to visit Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance, stating the inappropriateness of the duty-free import of Guangdong rice. The details are as follows:

Chamber of Commerce Petition Yesterday, at 11:00 AM, Huang Shisan and Shen Renwu, representatives of the rice industry in Jiangxi Province, Cui Lianggong, Tao Yinhuai, and Lin Ruofu, representatives of the rice industry in Anhui Province, Chen Yunseng, representative of the rice industry in Changsha City, Huang Yunqing, Bao Jun'an, and Xie Qian'e, representatives of the miscellaneous grain industry in Hankou City, Zhou Ming and Zhu Zixiang, representatives of the rice industry in Ningbo and Shanghai counties, Chen Shide, Gu Jiren, Gu Xinyi, Chen Ziyi, and Chuan Changyu, representatives of the rice industry in Shanghai City, totaling sixteen people, went to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to explain the significant impact of duty-free imports to Guangdong on rural commerce. Yan E'sheng, Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, received them and promised to submit the matter to the chairman for handling and arranged for the chairman to lead Gu Xinyi, the representative of the rice merchants, to visit Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance, at 4:00 PM in the afternoon to present everything.

Joint Letter from Rice Merchants Representatives from rice merchants in various provinces and cities jointly wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying, "We respectfully report that the taxation of imported foreign rice began in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), but Guangdong Province did not achieve unified collection until last year. Soon after, there was a request for duty-free status, and the Executive Yuan ordered the Hunan Provincial Government to quickly develop measures to sell Hunan rice to Guangdong for relief and instructed the Ministry of Railways to set special prices for Hunan rice to Guangdong, so that the economies and food supplies of the two provinces could be mutually adjusted. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance also confirmed that the foreign rice tax was established to protect domestic agricultural products and stated that the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui had bumper harvests last year and had surplus grain to supply the needs of Guangdong Province. If Guangdong Province lacks food, it should purchase domestic rice for relief. The official directive was clear, but in the end, the request was granted, and foreign rice was allowed to be imported at half-tax rate with 1.3 million dan on credit. Recently, another 2 million dan of foreign rice and grain were allowed to be completely duty-free to Guangdong. The two decisions within three months are difficult to understand. Is it believed that domestic rice is insufficient for supply and foreign rice must be relied upon? As far as our associations are concerned, the rice currently waiting to be shipped to Guangdong from the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu is estimated to be over 2 million dan, and there are still considerable reserves, which are more than sufficient to meet the needs of the lean season. Moreover, the early rice in Guangdong is early-maturing, and the harvest period is not far away. The early rice harvest in Hunan Province will also be within three months, and there will be self-sufficient supplies thereafter. There is no need to worry about shortages. Why is there a need for foreign rice? Or is it feared that domestic transportation is not convenient enough and that transportation may not keep up? However, since the opening of the Yuehan Railway, the surplus grain from Hunan and Hubei has been directly transported to Guangdong Province, which is very fast. The rice from Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces is also very convenient to transport by sea. There is even less need for foreign rice. Even if we take a step back and say that Guangdong Province lacks grain and transportation is difficult, in order to implement the established policy of protecting domestic agricultural products, we should try to provide relief within the possible scope. It is not necessary to give up eating because of choking, or to abandon the essential and pursue the trivial. In short, at a time when our country's food supply is quite self-sufficient, suddenly allowing foreign rice to be duty-free is not appropriate in terms of national economy, customs integrity, food regulation, or any other aspect. Our associations have already sent representatives to the Yuan and Ministry to strongly state the drawbacks and request the repeal of the duty-free order to maintain the national foundation. However, we are concerned that our efforts are weak and that it will be difficult to gain approval. Moreover, the matter concerns the prosperity and decline of the entire rural and commercial sectors of the country, which is very important. We are specifically writing to request that the chairman and standing committee members of your association immediately lead representatives from various provinces to petition the Minister of Finance. If approval cannot be obtained, they should go to Hangzhou again to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to petition and achieve the goal. Agriculture and commerce will be grateful together."

Official Letter from the Chamber of Commerce The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Vice Minister of Finance, stating, "(Omitted above) Guangdong Province's food supply can be continuously supplemented by the surplus rice from provinces with good harvests. It is not that there is a danger of supply shortages if a large amount of duty-free foreign rice is not imported. There are facts to prove the amount of rice in storage in each province, the amount that can be exported to Guangdong Province, and the capacity of road and water transportation to reach Guangdong Province within the shortest possible time. However, Guangdong Province has not considered this and, considering that the 1.3 million shi of half-tax credit is insufficient, has expanded it again to 4 million shi completely duty-free. It seems that the aim is not to provide relief for the people's food supply but to specifically open up sales channels for foreign rice. From the perspective of protecting domestic rice and supporting rural areas, this is contradictory. Now that Minister Kong is dispatched abroad, a special letter is sent by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, along with the representatives to meet and accept suggestions and mediate. It is sincerely hoped."

### Silk Weaving Workers Demand Conditions and the Social Bureau Orders a Compromise

A General Wage Increase of 10% Is Ordered for Both Parties to Obey. Workers Arrested in the Meiya General Factory Conflict Were Released on Bail. Party and Government Officials Were Sent Last Night to Advise Workers to Return to Work.

Silk weaving factory workers demanded improved treatment and, after the Social Bureau convened a mediation, both labor and management insisted on the amount of wage increase, resulting in no resolution. Workers in various factories went on a general strike the night before. Workers at the Meiya General Factory clashed with police yesterday morning, and sixteen arrested workers were released on bail. The workers held a representative meeting, demanding a general wage increase of 20%. Party and government agencies discussed the matter yesterday morning and ordered a compromise solution, deciding on a general wage increase of 10%, ordering both parties to comply. At the same time, efforts were made to persuade the workers to return to work as soon as possible. The details are as follows:

Silk Weaving Workers Go on Strike After the Social Bureau convened labor and management for mediation without success the day before, silk weaving trade unions in various districts implemented a general strike starting at 8:00 PM that afternoon. Party and government agencies conducted a thorough study of the wage increase for silk weaving workers and decided on a compromise solution, a general wage increase of 10%, and adopted administrative measures, ordering both parties to comply. They immediately dispatched cadres in groups to advise silk weaving trade unions in various districts not to go on strike on their own, but the workers in various factories had already gone on strike, making persuasion difficult. They could only discuss with the responsible personnel of the trade unions in various districts to strictly maintain order and not act freely.

Meiya Workers Clash with Police At about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the Meiya General Factory in Dapuqiao, Nanshi, suddenly moved goods out, which was seen by the striking workers, who stepped forward to stop them. A conflict arose with the guards stationed for protection. The Police Bureau received a report and dispatched red armored cars to the scene to stand by. During the conflict, three policemen and eleven workers were injured. The Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters received a report and immediately sent Zhu Guilin and Li Weixiong to advise the workers. It was not until about 3:00 AM that the workers were completely dispersed. Sixteen arrested workers, including Pan Yuncai, were taken to the Ximen Branch for interrogation.

Industry Association Requests Strict Prohibition The Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association, considering that the workers in various factories suddenly went on strike during the mediation by the competent authorities in accordance with legal procedures, which is legally inappropriate, decided to submit a report to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau after reporting by the members, requesting strict prohibition of workers' strike actions and requesting the Police Bureau to provide effective protection for various factories. As for the compromise solution ruled by the Social Bureau, a meeting will be held to discuss it after receiving the order, and the resolution of the general meeting will be taken to Beijing for petition. Since yesterday, armed police officers dispatched by the police stations in various districts have been protecting the silk weaving factories in the area.

Advising Workers to Return to Work Last Night Zhou Jinong, director of the People's Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhang Sheng, chief of the Labor Movement Section, and cadres Lu Yinchu and Li Weixiong, Zhu Guilin and Ren Jimo, members of the Mediation Section of the Social Bureau, etc., gathered at 5:00 PM yesterday to separately convene the directors of silk weaving trade unions in various districts and representatives of workers from various factories to report on the content of the compromise solution ruled by the party and government agencies and made every effort to persuade the workers to return to work as soon as possible. The trade unions in various districts expressed obedience to the orders of the party and government, but the workers insisted on a general wage increase of 10%, believing that it was difficult to persuade the workers. Finally, it was decided that the directors and representatives would be responsible for educating the workers.

Social Bureau Orders Both Parties to Comply The Social Bureau issued a directive to the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association and the silk weaving trade unions in various districts last night, stating in general terms that the workers' demands for improved treatment and increased wages have been mediated by this bureau three times, and the following have been agreed by both parties: (Such as working hours, etc., as seen in the report on the 28th, omitted) The ten conditions that have been agreed by both parties should be strictly implemented immediately. A general wage increase of 10% is approved, and the workers' demands for conditions related to wages are generally revoked. Regarding the problem of the contract system, the solution is that the contract system is a contractual nature, and in the future, wages will be paid by the factory to the contractor and then transferred to the workers, lest the factory and the workers have an employment relationship. Regarding the issue of paid holidays on legal holidays, the factory will subsidize the weavers with 50 cents per day, and the wages of miscellaneous workers will be paid as usual. The above methods were jointly approved by the Municipal Party Headquarters and ordered to be followed. Both labor and management must not create further complications to resolve the disputes.

Labor and Management Groups Hold Late Night Meetings ㊀ The Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association convened an executive committee at 7:00 PM last night after receiving the Social Bureau's directive. Cai Shengbai, Qiu Peiyue, Cai Xintao, and others attended to discuss the case. ㊁ The silk weaving trade unions in Districts 1, 3, 4, and 7 began to receive the Social Bureau's directive at about 8:00 PM last night and immediately convened emergency meetings separately to discuss solutions. At the same time, the Committee for Improved Treatment Conditions also held a meeting in West Shanghai. It is heard that although the workers insisted on striving for a general wage increase of 20%, after the representatives advised them, they may return to work soon.

Arrested Workers Completely Released on Bail The situation deteriorated after the police arrested the striking workers, and the striking workers paraded in groups, causing chaos. The party and government agencies believed that Pan Yuncai, the standing preparatory member of the silk weaving trade union in the district, had been arrested, so no one was in charge of the trade union and there was no way to advise the workers. They discussed with Yao Guangnai, head of the Ximen Branch, and others on how to maintain order and decided to release the arrested workers Pan Yuncai, Yu Jinrong, Jin Xiangbao, Cai Liankang, Xu Xuegui, Du Fasheng, Huang Xiuying, Zhang Xiuying, Zhang Yunxia, Wei Dongjuan, Zhou A'mei, and others, totaling sixteen people, on bail at about 5:00 AM yesterday.

Workers Hold Representative Meeting Silk weaving workers held a representative meeting at the Wusa Cemetery in Baziqiao, Zhabei, at 11:00 AM yesterday. Workers from various districts, totaling about 500 people, attended. First, the chairman reported on the mediation by the party and government agencies and the process of the workers' automatic strike. Then, discussions began and the following were passed on the spot: ㊀ The minimum wage increase is a general wage increase of 20%. ㊁ Request the party and government agencies to release the arrested workers. ㊂ Decide to invite the news media to Hongxingli, Caojiadu, at 4:00 PM on April 1 to report the truth of the matter. ㊃ Issue a general strike declaration, tasking the representatives from Damei, Meifeng, and Baohua factories with drafting the content, including: A. The recent labor-management situation in the silk weaving industry; B. The process of this dispute; C. The minimum demands of the workers; D. The workers absolutely support the government and implement labor-management cooperation. ㊄ Decide to petition the party and government agencies at 10:00 AM on April 1.

Party and Government Discuss Disposal Measures Xu Yefu, Chief of the Third Section of the Social Bureau, Zhu Guilin, a member of the Mediation Section, Zhou Funong, Director of the People's Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Ling Yinchu and Li Weixiong, cadres, etc., discussed the measures for disposing of the workers' treatment conditions in the silk weaving industry at yesterday morning. It is heard that it was decided to follow the compromise solution proposed by the party and government agencies, adopt administrative measures, and order the silk weaving trade unions and the silk weaving industry association in various districts to follow the methods and increase the wages, such as a general wage increase of 10%. The articles that have been mediated and established should be observed and implemented by both parties, and personnel will be sent to explain to the silk weaving trade unions in various districts again, hoping that all workers will return to work in factories on the morning of April 1.

On a given signal, the accomplices swarmed forward and surrounded the two women, brandishing their weapons and warning them to be silent, ordering them to hand over their valuables or face death. They were robbed of a total of 35 yuan in new currency and fled in all directions. The three women cried out for robbers, and Hua Constable No. 901, upon hearing the alarm, helped to capture Wu Changsan and recover two axes and a deck of poker cards from the ground. He was taken to the Huishan Police Station for detention and was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Zhang Dayin, a lawyer from the police station, described the details of the case and requested an extension of the detention of the accomplices. According to Hua Constable No. 901's report, the defendant was captured. The fierce axe and poker card were presented for inspection. The victim Chen Gu said that 23 yuan in banknotes were robbed, Jiang Wang 7 yuan, and Shen Jin 5 yuan. They all said that they had known the defendant for years and that he instigated the incident. At the time, he pulled out the fierce axe and first threatened them. When questioned, Wu Changsan's confession was ambiguous. Judge Xiao Xieben ruled that he would be remanded in custody for further investigation.

### Sichuan Highway Bureau Chief Embezzles Public Funds and Flees to Shanghai

Guarantor Suffers, Tracks Him to Shanghai, Reports Arrest, Bail Granted Pending Further Inquiry

Chen Xuehai, a native of Sichuan and chief of the engineering section of the Sichuan Provincial Highway Bureau, took office at the end of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935]. By January of the following year, he had embezzled 2,897 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, and 2 li of public funds. The Bureau transferred Chen to the Chengdu County Government for detention and repayment. After Pei Benchu, manager of the Mindewazi Sock Factory, provided bail for Chen, Chen immediately fled to Shanghai, hiding in a medical practice at 54 Huayuanfang in the French Concession. The Chengdu County Government then detained the guarantor and demanded that he hand over the person or compensate for the public funds. Pei also provided bail to search for Chen. Recently, Zhang Peiran, a shareholder of the Mindewazi Sock Factory, obtained a notice issued by the Chengdu County Government on January 19th of this year, came to Shanghai to find Chen's residence, and on the 12th of last month, reported it to the French Concession police. Chen was detained and sent to the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where it was ruled that a shop bail of 1,500 yuan be paid while awaiting further investigation. These details have been recorded in this newspaper. On one hand, Zhang Peiran telegraphed the Chengdu County Government for instructions, and on the other hand, the Special Second Court also sent a letter to the Chengdu County Government inquiring about the case. After receiving Zhang's telegram and the Special Second Court's official letter, the Chengdu County Government first telegraphed the Special Second Court, confirming that Chen Xuehai had indeed embezzled public funds and requested his detention. Yesterday, Liao, the Chief Judge of the Special Second Court, came to the First Criminal Division for interrogation. According to Zhang Peiran, after sending the telegram last time, the Chengdu County Government had already sent an official letter to the Court yesterday, requesting that Chen be detained, pending a transfer by the Chengdu Local Court. The court, after reviewing the documents and telegram from Chengdu County, said to Zhang, "The official letter only says that Chen Xuehai embezzled public funds, which is a civil matter. It does not specify criminal responsibility. It only says to ask this court to detain Chen, but does not say anything about transferring him. The official letter is too vague. This court is acting on the basis of assisting in the investigation and cannot casually detain someone based on your words. You must quickly supplement the procedure to resolve the matter." The defendant Chen Xuehai was also advised that he should quickly handle the case, otherwise, when the Chengdu court sends another official letter requesting this court to detain you, you will have to be detained and wait for transfer, which would be very detrimental to you. The defendant repeatedly agreed. The court then ruled that the defendant should remain on the original bail, pending further investigation.

### Lawyer Xu Yi's Lawsuit for False Accusation Judgement

Defendants All Found Not Guilty

Lawyer Xu Yi sued Cheng Li Tianzhi, the wife of real estate tycoon Cheng Linsheng, and Cheng's brother-in-law, Li Quanshen, in the Local Court for falsely accusing Xu of forging documents in the 24th year of the Republic [i.e., 1935]. Prosecutor Li Fen brought a public prosecution, which was heard by Judge Tan Zhuohong, who is now in Suzhou Prison. The first instance resulted in a sentence of four months in prison. An appeal to the High Court resulted in a reversal and acquittal. Therefore, Xu requested that they be punished for false accusation. Judge Li Xuedeng summoned and ordered Li Quanshen to be released on bail by a lawyer. Yesterday, the verdict was announced. Because Xu's previous case was a public prosecution brought by the prosecutor, the responsibility for false accusation did not belong to the plaintiff. Therefore, it was ruled that both Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Quanshen were not guilty.

### Concubine Swallows Poison, Husband Watches Without Saving

Neighbors Inform the Mother's Family, Who Rush Her to the Hospital for Treatment

Wang Yongchun, a native of Shaoxing, residing at 81 Huagenao Road in the French Concession, is 43 years old and works as a leader in a Shaoxing opera troupe at the Great World amusement park. He has been living with a woman surnamed Zhu from Huzhou (26 years old) for three years. Their relationship has been harmonious, but recently, an old woman from a brothel frequently went to the Shaoxing opera venue at the Great World to watch the show and flirt with Wang Yongchun. Over time, after the show, the two would leave together for secret rendezvous. This was discovered by Wang's concubine, Zhu, who secretly entered the Shaoxing opera venue at the Great World on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, mingling among the audience to observe the truth about Wang Yongchun and the brothel woman. Not long after Zhu entered the venue, she saw the brothel woman gracefully enter and sit in the front row under the stage. When Wang Yongchun came on stage, the two exchanged glances and were very intimate. Zhu was burning with jealousy. After the show ended at about 6:00 PM, Zhu returned home and confronted Wang Yongchun. The two argued, and in a fit of anger, Zhu attempted suicide by secretly swallowing opium residue. When Wang Yongchun discovered that Zhu had taken poison, he did not send her to the hospital for treatment and acted as if nothing had happened. He still went to the Great World at about 8:00 PM to perform as usual. Later, a neighbor informed Zhu's mother, Zhu Zhou, who lived on Gonghe Road in Zhabei, who rushed Zhu to the hospital. The hospital reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to investigate. Because Zhu's poisoning was not severe, she vomited the poison after treatment and was hospitalized for observation. On one hand, the detectives reported the information to the police chief for review.

### A Bolt of Serge Found Inside a Woman's Pant Leg

Recovered After Being Discovered by a Shop Employee; Illegally Detained and Intimidated; Verdict: Both Parties Guilty

At 3:00 PM on the 29th of this month, a woman surnamed Zhang Zhu from Hubei, accompanied by a fifteen-year-old child, Zhang Yuya, suddenly came to a cloth shop at 553 Nanjing Road to buy cloth. At that time, they selected cloth worth 4.5 yuan and left. When she walked out of the store, Hua Cixin, a shop employee, discovered that a bolt of serge had been stolen. He chased after her and the child and recovered the stolen serge from inside her pant leg. Because the shop manager, Shen, a native of Suzhou, had recently reported thefts, and the branch of the shop at 494 Xinza Road had also recently been robbed of items such as theft-proof hands, he ordered employees Jiang Yangkang and Xu Jiuru to detain her. He then telephoned the branch and ordered employees Zhao Shichang and Ma Keming to go and bring the suspects upstairs and restrict their freedom of movement. They also used a Winchester rifle to intimidate her, ordering her to hand over 300 yuan in legal tender to compensate for the losses from previous thefts at the second branch. That night, they privately detained her overnight in room 13 of the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Haig. The next morning, they took her to the Tongxixiang guardhouse. By 10:00 AM, the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police had received a report and sent detectives Liu Shaokui, Zhu Shouchang, Yang Xiguang, and Zhou Honglin to rescue Zhang Zhu and arrest Shen, Jiang Yangkang, Xu Jiuru, and Ma Keming, seizing a Winchester rifle. According to Zhang Zhu's statement at the police station, she was raped once by Zhao Shichang in the Tongshang Hotel, and the 56 yuan in legal tender in her pocket was also taken. After investigation by the detectives, the rape accusation was found to be false. Yesterday morning, the suspects were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case, prosecuting Zhang Zhu for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law and Shen, Jiang, Xu, and Ma for restricting freedom under Article 302 of the Criminal Law. He also stated that Zhang Zhu had been sentenced to four months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence last year for theft and was still within the probation period. Zhang Zhu denied theft and described being illegally detained and extorted for 200 yuan. The four defendants, Shen, stated that they detained her temporarily to investigate previously stolen goods and hired lawyer Ye Xiabiao for defense. Judge Feng Shide verified the statements and ruled that Zhang Zhu was guilty of theft and sentenced to seven months in prison. Jiang Yangkang and Xu Jiuru were each fined 60 yuan. Ma Keming was found not guilty. Each paid 200 yuan bail pending appeal.

### Sanbei Company Streamlines Yangtze River Docks

The convenience and completeness of the Sanbei Company's facilities at wharves and warehouses along the Yangtze River have long been recognized by merchants and travelers along the Shanghai-Hankou route. In an effort to further improve, the Ningan pontoon, which originally docked in the center of the river in Wuhu and required small boats for passengers to board and disembark, has been moved to the Jiang'an River bank north of the Wuhu Zhaodun pontoon. A floating bridge has been built, allowing passengers to walk ashore without needing to take a boat. Moreover, the location is appropriate and rare. The company's upstream and downstream steamers have already docked there, making loading and unloading cargo and boarding and disembarking passengers more convenient than ever before.

### Wang Xiaoshu's Case of Inducing Adultery Re-Examined

Wang Xiaoshu, son of Wang Bin-yan, a director of the Zhabei Charity Association, was accused of inducing Zhou Min, the wife of his classmate Lu Yuan, into adultery in the 23rd year of the Republic [i.e., 1934]. In June of the 25th year [i.e., 1936], he induced her to run away with him (Zhou has since passed away). Last year, Wu sued Wang in the Local Court, which was heard by Judge Shao Qinzhi, who ruled that the case was not admissible. Wu appealed to the High Court, which reviewed the original judgment and sent it back for re-examination, deeming it erroneous. The presiding judge asked Wu, who stated, "Because his wife went to the Charity Association to visit her younger brother, and Wang was the administrator, she was induced into adultery and abducted. In the first instance, Judge Shao advised reconciliation. I considered our past friendship and asked for leniency, but the decision was ultimately not to accept the case. Now my wife has passed away, and I request a retrial and attach a civil suit for 1,000 yuan." Wang stated, "Zhou and Wu Zhenjue had already divorced through lawyer Fei Guoxi, so they cannot have the right to sue." However, Wu claimed that the divorce certificate was forged. Yesterday, Fei Guoxi was summoned as a witness and testified, "Wu Zhenjue and his wife were initially very harmonious, but in the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930], because Wu had an affair with a woman named Zhu Alin, the couple's feelings turned to animosity. Wu had accused Zhou of assault in this court, but they reconciled and withdrew the charges. However, their relationship could not be restored, so in August of the 19th year, I certified their divorce agreement." Wu claimed, "Although I had an affair with Zhu Taolin because Zhou could not have children, I have not seen her since. The stamp on this divorce certificate is not my original seal. There is a record of my seal in the Road Bureau, which can be compared. After the January 28th Incident [i.e., the Shanghai Incident of 1932] until July 1st of last year, my wife and I lived at 730 Xinmin Road, which can be verified by checking the household registration." Moreover, Fei Guoxi also issued a cohabitation agreement, stating that Wang left Zhou, paying 20,000 yuan in alimony. The court ordered further investigation and another hearing.

### Fan Yuemei Sues Younger Brother for Seizing Property

Fan Geng-hua, a wealthy landowner of No. 3 Fanjiagang, Jiangwan District, in this city, died in the 17th year of the Republic [i.e., 1928], leaving behind a considerable amount of property. Recently, his daughter Fan Yuemei (30 years old) hired lawyer Zhang Fukang to sue her younger brother Fan Shengda (27 years old) in the Local Court for seizing the property. Judge Chen Pin opened a mediation session yesterday and asked the plaintiff to state her case. She stated that Fan Geng-hua left behind a considerable amount of property, including approximately 20 mu of land in front of and behind the municipal government, along with nine houses on the land, as well as 21 mu of land and a bamboo garden in Jiangwan. The plaintiff and her younger brother, Fan Shengda, should each receive half of the property. She initially thought he was managing it on her behalf, but he had the intention of seizing it and refused to return it. He ignored her repeated requests and acted as if he had not heard them. Now, she does not have enough to eat, so she requests a strict order to divide the property. Fan Shengda stated that when his father died, he was only nine years old. They have five sisters who have not divided the property. After the death of their parents, the sisters married, and the funeral expenses for the five sisters and their parents were very high. All the property was mortgaged to others. The plaintiff married Bo Sheng and is quite wealthy, so her lawsuit is not true. The court ruled that mediation was unsuccessful and asked them to formally file a lawsuit.

### Woman Hangs Herself After Quarrel Over Moving

Pan Yao, a local young woman, 34 years old, rented a house at No. 10, Lane 343, Jiangjia Lane, Gordon Road, West Shanghai. Her husband, a copper smith, was also the same age. Because her husband planned to move elsewhere, and she did not agree, a quarrel broke out. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, she had the thought of ending her life and secretly went to the room and hanged herself. Fortunately, she was discovered by her family, who managed to save her and sent her to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

### Coal Ball Factory Robbed in Dongchang Road, Pudong

The Huasheng Machine-Made Coal Ball Factory at No. 105, Laobingchangtian, Dongchang Road, Pudong, was robbed on the afternoon of March 28th at 7:50 PM, before closing time. Suddenly, eight or nine bandits arrived. Three or four stood guard outside the door, and five rushed into the accounting room. Three of them held pistols and ordered everyone not to make a sound. They drove the owner, Niu Bangle, and seven of his employees into the room, shouting loudly and demanding valuables. They then searched arbitrarily, taking a silver box, three clothing boxes, and two book boxes, and thoroughly reviewing the old account books hanging on the wall, meticulously searching both accounting rooms without missing a single item. They stole 250 yuan in legal tender, two overcoats, a watch, nine zhang of serge, eight zhang of wool crepe, a cotton robe with silk lining, a felt hat, and two undershirts, worth about 200 yuan. The bandits were calm and composed during the robbery and did not panic. They also locked both doors of the factory with lead wire before calmly leaving. It was already 8:40 PM. The factory immediately reported to the Pudong Police Station (within five minutes). At 5:30 AM, the police chief sent inspectors and detectives to investigate. The bandits left behind a pistol bullet and an axe, which were immediately handed over to the police station for filing.

### Ni A'er Sentenced to Detention for Throwing Excrement Due to a Grudge

Yang Ada, a native of Dongtai, residing at 265 Caishi Road, French Concession, 25 years old, currently works as a waiter at the Tianchan Stage. Previously, Ni A'er, a fellow villager who was also a waiter at the Gong Stage, recommended him to the Gong Stage and paid a security deposit of 50 yuan. Later, because Yang behaved improperly and flirted with female customers, he was suspended. Ni returned 30 yuan of the security deposit. The two quarreled over the missing 20 yuan of the security deposit. Yang made threats, causing Ni to harbor resentment. On the 22nd of last month, Ni hired a beggar named Guo Tiangui to carry a large bag of excrement and wait in front of the Empire Theatre. When Yang passed by, Ni directed Guo to throw the excrement on Yang's face. Yang chased after Ni and Guo and caught them, reporting them to the police, who detained them and sent them to the Special Second Court for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Liao came to the First Criminal Division for interrogation. The police lawyer prosecuted under Article 309 of the Criminal Law. After questioning the defendants in court, Judge Liao immediately sentenced Ni A'er to 50 days of detention for public insult by violence and Guo Tiangui to 25 days of detention, with each day commuted to one yuan in fines.

### Taxpayers in Both Concessions Advise Cancellation of Tax Increases

Taxpayers of the Public Concession Write to the Taxpayers' Association; The French Concession Taxpayers' Association Sends a Special Letter to the Municipal Council

Public Concession Taxpayers, including Tao Wen, sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday, stating, "We are writing to inform you that the Municipal Council, disregarding the decline in the city's market and the reduced ability of residents to bear tax burdens, passed a proposal through a board vote despite the opposition of five Chinese directors, the reservation of two Japanese directors, and the support of two American and four British directors. The proposal decided to increase the general municipal tax from 14% to 16% and the land tax from 7 per mille to 8 per mille, effective July 1st of this year. On the surface, the general tax only increased by 2% and the land tax only increased by 1 per mille. However, upon further study, the general municipal tax did not increase by 2%, and the land tax did not increase by 1 per mille. In reality, the increase is as high as 14.3% compared to the original amount. For example, someone who originally paid 100 yuan in rent had to pay 14 yuan in general tax, but after July 1st, they have to pay 16 yuan, which is an increase of 2 yuan compared to 14 yuan. Originally, someone whose land was valued at 1,000 yuan by the Municipal Council had to pay 7 yuan in land tax, but after July 1st, they have to pay 8 yuan, which is an increase of 1 yuan compared to 7 yuan. Comparing the actual increase with the original amount of tax payable, expressed as a percentage, the increase is 14.3%. The taxes paid by residents of the concession have increased by 14.3% at once. We ask, after July 1st, will the Municipal Council's service to taxpayers also increase by 14.3% compared to the original amount? Based on past facts, although the Municipal Council's police expenses have increased by more than 4 million yuan in seven years, how much has the protection of life and property for residents of the concession increased? Nanjing Road, which is known for its strict security, even experienced a daring robbery in broad daylight, and the perpetrators have not been caught to this day. Public buses crash and kill and injure pedestrians, but no restrictions have been imposed. From this perspective, the burden on residents of the concession has increased, while the protection they receive has decreased proportionally. Residents of the concession naturally do not want to increase their burden and are unable to bear it. The five Chinese directors, having considered the above facts, expressed extreme opposition when the proposal to increase taxes was being decided, which can be said to have fulfilled their responsibilities. The will of the five Chinese directors is the will of the residents of the concession. All taxpayers should support the Chinese directors' position and strive to implement it, otherwise, they will not only fail the Chinese directors, but also render the achievements of the May 30th Massacre in vain. As this concerns the interests of all taxpayers and the effectiveness of the Chinese directors' statements in this and future matters, we dare to offer our humble opinions and ask that you strive with the Municipal Council to achieve the goal of canceling the tax increase resolution. We send this to the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association." (Xin Sheng News Agency)

French Concession The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating, "We are writing to inform you that on March 24th, your Council disregarded the claims of the Chinese Directors representing the majority of tax payers, and instead ratified the increase in taxes from 14 to 16 percent with a forced vote, which has caused resentment among all the taxpayers in the city. Your Council believes that the greatest reason for increasing taxes this time is that the public revenue and expenditure has not been balanced in recent years due to the sluggish market, with the expectation that the increase in taxes can make up for that. However, since the depression is due to the poverty of the people and declining incomes, it has become a common phenomenon in the concession. The situation is dire that it is already difficult to maintain. Those who have been working hard to reduce expenses in order to prolong their lives are really hard to find. The council has a deep understanding of the social situation; all of the above is clearly understood. The Chinese directors are unable to agree on increasing taxes that are not without basis. A recent survey on the shops and resident in the concession shows that those who are not able to maintain their urban lives and move back to their hometowns are about 30% of the total. The increase in closed shops and vacant rooms is sufficient evidence. According to this distribution percentage, the burden that was borne by 100 people in the past is now shared by 70 people. Therefore, residents in the concession have already seen a non-material increase of 30% in their burden. It is sincere to give considerations to the prosperity of the entire market, your council should assist today's residents of the concession, and yet, it is insisting on demanding a balance in the expenditure of the council. Taking the insupportable load and placing it on the exhausted people, it is not the way to maintain the business of the council, but rather to want to follow the path of extinction. The lives of the people depend on it, not just an easy answer. The agreement on the increase of 16% still asks for deep consideration to go back and review. It is a must to cancel the proven case, and must let the council know, the will of the Chinese Directors are bound to the lives of the 95% of the residents, and is bound to the location where the 95% of your tax collection is, although Chinese people only have five seats in the board, but the responsibility is almost as big as the whole concession, now your council is looking at the slight number of the five seats, all the cases that do not align with the people's feeling, take the dignity of the vote, and suppress the meeting that passed the small numbers, the meeting's true definition is completely lost, and ask if there is any law to it? The concern of our organization is something we don't dare to be silent about. What council is asked to do must be based on true facts. The way to balance expense and revenue is not about finding a new source, but rather a new cut. The way to manage the finance is not in increasing taxes, but in nurturing the strength of the people. If the strength of the people is thick, the products are developed, which leads to a prosperous market, the people will increase naturally, and the increase in council collection will not be about adding on the burden, it will be a kindness to the people and society. The offering of humble words are done with loyalty in the goal to be learned from, this is written to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council." (National News Agency)

### Strike by Workers at Two China United Knitting Factories

Yesterday Representatives Were Sent to Petition the Party and Government

Dagonbao reports that over 300 workers at the China Underwear Company Knitting Factory on Kang Nao Road, Jinsitu Temple, West Shanghai, went on strike again on the afternoon before yesterday at 6 p.m. to protest against the dismissal of workers Li Du and Duan Youchun by the factory's work director. Yesterday morning, they sent Peng Zuoyi, Cui Xiqi, Zhang Zhixiu, Xu Lanyuan, and others as representatives to the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. Zhang Sheng, the director of the Labor and Peasant Stock of the Civil Movement Department, received them and, after inquiring about the situation, immediately sent staff member Dai Yongchan to mediate, in order to prevent the labor unrest from escalating. The Lianhua Qiji Knitting Factory on Beile Road, Rue du Père Robert, in the French Concession, employs over 120 workers. Because the factory announced it would dismiss half of the original workers, it caused worker backlash and a strike. Yesterday, the workers specially prepared documents to petition to the party and government organs, and put forward eight conditions: ㊀ The factory is required to allow all to return to work, and to work ten hours per day; ㊁ During the shutdown, each worker will be subsidized with three jiao for daily meals; ㊂ The factory will guarantee that there will be no more dismissals of workers or shutdowns; ㊃ All holidays stipulated by the National Government will be observed with work stoppage, and wages will be paid as usual; ㊄ Ouyang Xin, who oppressed the workers, is to be dismissed; ㊅ If workers get sick, the factory must bear the medical expenses; ㊆ Female workers shall be given one month's leave for childbirth, with a factory subsidy of fifteen yuan; ㊇ Wages will be paid twice a month, on the 1st and 15th.

### Japanese Banks Transfer Silver Reserves

Yesterday Morning, Payment Was Made in Succession

Huadong News Agency reports that regarding the transfer of silver reserves from Japanese banks to the Central Bank, after negotiations in Shanghai between Xi Demao, manager of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Japanese economic figure Kodama Kenji and others, six banks, namely, Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chosen, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsubishi Bank, Mitsui Bank, and Shanghai Bank, successively made payments yesterday morning. The shipments yesterday morning were from Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and several other banks. As a result of this negotiation, the Japanese banks have had all their silver reserves completely returned. Huadong News Agency learned that the total amount was 9,195,000 yuan, including factory notes. It is noted that the Japanese banks initially had silver reserves of over 20 million yuan, and the amount now paid out is not the entire amount.

Beijing News: The silver on hand at the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping held by the Japanese has been designated to be handed over in full to the Central Bank, and the handover will begin next week. The Central Bank has sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the appointment of a special commissioner to supervise the handling of the receipt procedures.

### National Phonetic Telegrams to Begin Today

The Ministry of Communications, in order to reduce telegraph transmission procedures and facilitate communication for all sectors, recently promulgated regulations for National Phonetic Telegrams, instructing the telegraph bureaus in Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, and five other locations, to start this National Phonetic Telegram service on April 1st, using National Phonetic characters to directly transmit telegraph messages. The rates will still be the same as for domestic Chinese vernacular telegrams, providing convenience for senders and receivers by eliminating the need to look up telegram codebooks. This is a significant innovation in the history of Chinese telegraphs and a major contribution to the popularization of Mandarin education. The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, after receiving the order, has been preparing and will implement it as scheduled, starting today, to begin receiving and sending National Phonetic Telegrams.

### Driver Flees After Car Runs Over Worker

Braking Marks Eleven Feet Eight Inches. The Deceased's Body Was Examined by the Court Yesterday.

Around 8 p.m. the night before last, near Mack Lee Road on Yangshupu Road, a private car (No. 5734), traveling from east to west, suddenly hit a man who appeared to be a worker, about thirty years old, knocking him to the ground. A patrolman No. 136 of the Wayside Police Station happened to pass by and saw it. He obtained the driver's license, named Wang Xueliang, residing at No. 12, Lane 47, Chengdu Road. Later, while the patrolman was reporting to the police station by phone to call an ambulance, the driver took the opportunity to drive away without a trace. The injured man was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment but was ineffective, and he soon died. The police sent detectives to investigate the address on the driver's license and found that Wang Xueliang had moved long ago. The current resident is Dr. Xia Wenying. The detectives then carried the body to the mortuary on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and a clerk, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. Patrolman No. 136 reported the previous situation and stated, "On that day, I was facing west at that location and saw a truck traveling from west to east. Suddenly, I heard a very loud car braking sound from behind. When I turned around, I saw the deceased had been knocked to the ground and the car had stopped. At that time, I examined the braking marks, which were over eleven feet and eight inches. I obtained the driver's license and was about to make a phone call when the car suddenly fled. There were no other vehicles or pedestrians on the road at that time," and so on. Mr. Song then declared that the deceased, an unnamed man, had indeed been killed by being hit by car No. 5734. In addition to Wang Xueliang being arrested and handled by the police, the body was handed over to Pushan Cemetery for burial.

### National Phonetic Alphabet and Romanization Telegraphs

— Yan Bing

▲Starting from the 1st of this month ▲Trial implementation first in Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other bureaus

The long-awaited National Phonetic Alphabet and Romanization telegraphs will be trial-implemented starting from the 1st of this month in Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Ping five bureaus first. Telegraphs using these methods can be read as soon as they are received, without the need for translation like four-code telegraphs. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications created these two types of telegraphs with significant intentions:

First, Chinese characters have always been known to be difficult, because their composition has no fixed rules, making them difficult to learn and difficult to popularize. For more than ten years, the phonetic alphabet has been promoted by Chinese people to promote education, and its effectiveness is very obvious. However, in order to further promote social attention and assist the implementation of the National Phonetic Alphabet, it is necessary to actually increase its use. In the past, phonetic alphabet telegrams were only used on some railways in the country. Now, with the creation by the Ministry of Communications, they will soon be available throughout the country, so that people everywhere will clearly understand the practical suitability of the National Phonetic Alphabet, and will study it together. Then, the popularization of education in our country will eventually be achieved.

Second, our country's telegrams were first created by foreigners. Because the characters cannot be spelled with basic letters like those of other countries, four codes are compiled to replace one character. This method has been followed to this day and has not been changed. Because it is not commonly used internationally, it is inconvenient and uneconomical to send messages abroad. Now, the Romanization telegraph is created to transmit overseas, which can be read and understood immediately. Its convenience for communication with overseas Chinese is not insignificant.

Third, four-code substitutions require translation. Although those familiar with the telegraph code can understand it at a glance, it still takes time. Telegrams are mainly about speed. The use of National Phonetic Alphabet and Romanization is equivalent to directly sending messages in text, and the communication speed will naturally increase.

The Ministry of Communications' various facilities in recent years have all aimed at facilitating public communication. Before the trial implementation of the above-mentioned telegrams, the receiving and sending operators have undergone a series of training sessions to ensure extreme accuracy and speed in sending and receiving these telegrams. At the beginning of the implementation, all sectors of Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Ping might as well try it out.

### The Significance of Opening Beijing-Shanxi and Beijing-Guangdong Telephone Service

— Yi Zhen

Our country has a very large territory, with thousands of miles between the north and the south, and their habits and customs are different. Therefore, the implementation of government orders often encounters obstacles. To achieve national unity, it is necessary to develop transportation. President Sun Yat-sen's "Industrial Plan" has shown its beginning, and the benefit of breaking down local concepts, harmonizing mutual feelings, and communicating cultures in various places is no better than telecommunications. There is a provision in the Industrial Plan that "wireless radio shall be built all over the country," which is well-founded.

The domestic wireless telephone built by the Ministry of Communications has made rapid progress in recent years! After the completion of the nine-province long-distance telephone project, major cities in the provinces and regions have successively opened telephone service. The plan is to divide the country into several regions, with the important cities in each region as the center point of the region. The construction projects between the center points are connected by wire, wireless, or a combination of wireless and wire; if the line is too long and the power is insufficient, relay stations are set up to relay the signal. If the construction of relay stations in various places is completed, all important cities in the country can open telephone service.

On the 26th of last month, Nanjing opened telephone service with Guangzhou. The sound was clear, no different from a local telephone. The details of the telephone call have been recorded in this newspaper and will not be repeated. In addition, Nanjing and Yangqu (Taiyuan) are also scheduled to open telephone service on the 1st of this month. Nanjing is located in the capital of our country, Guangzhou is the political and economic center of South China, and Yangqu is a key town for national defense. The two places are thousands of miles away from Beijing, with different customs and different worlds. In the past, although telegrams could reach them, they were not as good as having telephone equipment, which can talk across thousands of miles in the same hall. The above-mentioned circuit has now been completed by the Ministry of Communications and opened for telephone service, and its significance is self-evident.

The construction between Nanjing and Yangqu in the above-mentioned project is wired telephone, and the construction between Nanjing and Guangzhou is wireless and wired telephone, which is determined according to the value of the project and the needs of the local area. The clarity of the call and the low price are no different.

In the future, if people in our capital want to know about the situation in the north, please call Yangqu. If they want to know about the situation in the south, please call Guangzhou. On the contrary, if people in Yangqu or Guangzhou want to know about the situation in the capital, please send a telegram to Guangzhou and they will receive a satisfactory reply. Because of the frequent telephone calls, the feelings between the two places can be connected, the culture of the north and the south can be communicated, the local situation can be fully known to the central government, and the central government's orders can be strictly followed by the local government. The spirit of sincere unity is almost achieved. Therefore, this Beijing-Shanxi and Beijing-Guangdong telephone service is no less than adding a solid pillar to the foundation of national unity.

### Bird's-Eye View of the Development of Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Service by the Ministry of Communications

— Xiang Lin

Long-distance telephone is an important sector in the telecommunications industry. Because it has the convenience of direct questions and answers, it is simpler and more convenient than sending telegrams, and its effectiveness is the most significant. Therefore, those who speak of developing telecommunications in modern times all regard the construction of long-distance telephones as the top priority. Therefore, although the history of long-distance telephones is not as long as that of telegraphs, the speed of development has greatly surpassed them.

Although the establishment of long-distance telephone in our country has been around for some time, in the past, due to the rise of military affairs, there was no time for construction. All the lines were few and far between. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications, in view of the importance of long-distance telephone, began to work hard on construction. In the year 1936 alone, more than 7,600 kilometers of new lines were added. The addition of copper lines to existing telephone poles also included lines from Nanchang to Jiujiang, Jiujiang to Guling, and Tianjin to Liangwangzhuang. In terms of the places where telephone service is available, as of the end of February 1937, there were a total of 911 locations. Most of the important cities and towns in the country are connected by long-distance telephone. Since the beginning of this year, although it has only been three months, there have been many places where long-distance telephone service has been opened. The important ones are described as follows:

㊀ Hankou to Hangzhou, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Tongguan;

㊁ Nanchang, Jiujiang, Guling to Kaifeng, Zhengxian, Luoyang, Xinyang, Xuchang, etc.;

㊂ Guling to Shanghai, Wuxian, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, Kaifeng, etc.;

㊃ Kaifeng, Zhengxian, Luoyang to Shanghai, Wuxian, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, etc.;

㊄ Tongguan to Nanjing, Nanchang, Changsha, etc.;

㊅ Chang'an to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Yueyang, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Chengdu, etc.

Tongguan and Chang'an are both far in the Northwest, and their news with the southern provinces has been quite isolated. The occurrence of the "December 12th" incident last year was not without the misunderstanding caused by the isolation of news. The Ministry of Communications, in view of the importance of national defense in the Northwest, specifically made efforts to open telephone service between Chang'an and Tongguan and the capital and other important cities, so as to eliminate all obstacles through the connection of long-distance telephone and enable the central government and local governments to receive the effect of arms and fingers. Therefore, its significance is extremely significant, and it is not only for the convenience of commerce and people.

The above are all wired long-distance telephone. In recent years, in addition to actively expanding wireless long-distance telephone equipment have been installed in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou. Wireless telephone is suitable for long-distance communication. At present, the United States has more construction. Most of the important cities in the United States are connected by wireless telephone. As for European countries, because the country is small, it is only necessary to lay wired long-distance telephones, and there is no need to use domestic wireless telephones at all, so there are few installations. Our country has a vast territory, and the area of one province is almost larger than the territory of a general European and Western country. Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hankou are the three major towns in the country, and they have close relations in politics, commerce, and national defense. However, the distance between them is very far. Guangdong is located in the south, while Shanghai and Hankou are located in the east and west. If you want to build a wired telephone, it will be very costly and there will be many twists and turns. Therefore, wireless telephone equipment was specially installed in these three places in 1936. The wireless telephone between Shanghai and Hankou was opened for telephone service in September last year. Guangzhou to Shanghai and Hankou have also been opened for business one after another this year, opening the precedent for domestic wireless telephone in our country. Other places are still being installed in succession, depending on the need.

After Shanghai-Guangdong-Hankou-Guangdong have been opened for telephone service, Hong Kong and the economic relations between Shanghai and Hankou in our country are extremely close, and at this time, when Sino-British friendship is becoming more and more friendly, the convenience of transportation is especially important. Therefore, the wireless telephone between Shanghai-Guangdong-Hankou-Guangdong and the wired telephone between Guangdong and Hong Kong were used to open the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Hankou-Hong Kong telephone service. This business was also completed in February and March of this year. The telephone waves are very clear, and the people in the two places unanimously praised it.

In addition, the places that have recently opened telephone service include Nanjing to Guangzhou and Nanjing to Yangqu. There is a special article in this issue that has been discussed separately, so I will not repeat it here.

In short, the rapid development of long-distance telephone in our country in recent years is an undeniable fact. This kind of rapid progress is due to the efforts of the authorities, but the stimulation of national disasters has also made it so. Our country has a vast territory, and now there are only more than 910 places that can be called, which is not enough to be said to be common. At that time, when we are actively strengthening national defense, the construction of long-distance telephone in the future has yet to be continued.

### Inquiry Phone Service Established by the Telegraph Bureau

— Mu Gong

— Another New Initiative for the Telegraph Bureau to Serve Society

In order to facilitate the public's use of telephones to inquire about various local affairs, the Ministry of Transportation stipulated in March of the 24th year of the Republic of China the "Measures for Telephone Bureaus to Answer Telephone Users' Inquiries Regarding Various Local Matters," with the original management desk or inquiry desk of the telephone bureau concurrently handling the answering of inquiries, which was generally considered convenient. However, these measures stipulated that telephone bureaus should handle the inquiries and were limited to answering local matters, while matters concerning telegraph and telephone services were not addressed, which was somewhat imperfect. In order to facilitate the public's inquiries regarding telegraph and telephone service matters, the Ministry of Transportation stipulated a "Measures for Telegraph Bureaus and Telephone Bureaus to Establish Business Inquiry Telephones," designating important telegraph bureaus and telephone bureaus to set up business inquiry telephones for external inquiries.

The matters for inquiry and response are divided into two types: telegraph and telephone. (A) Matters related to the scope of telegraph services are as follows:

1.  Matters concerning the location, price, fees, sending procedures, and writing format of various domestic and international telegrams:

2.  Matters concerning the utilization of various domestic and international telegram special services and provincial fee methods;

3.  Matters concerning fees and procedures for methods such as "telegraph registration," "city telephone receiving and sending telegrams," "commercial dedicated line receiving and sending telegrams," and "account sending telegrams";

4.  Explanatory matters concerning various telegraph business regulations and newly established methods:

5.  Matters concerning requesting past telegram paper or notifying personnel to collect telegrams.

(B) Matters related to the scope of telephone services are as follows:

1.  Matters concerning the procedures and payment of fees for installing, removing, moving, and changing city telephone sets:

2.  Matters concerning the call locations and prices of long-distance and international calls:

3.  Matters concerning long-distance telephone registration procedures and the types of locations where special services are open:

4.  Explanatory matters concerning city long-distance and international telephone business regulations and newly established methods.

Other matters concerning inquiries about telegraph delays or errors, telephone malfunctions, delayed connections, telephone number inquiries, and matters not within the scope of the preceding article may also be inquired about. The administrator will inquire and respond on behalf of the competent department, or inform the inquirer of the telephone number of the competent department and ask them to inquire directly.

The business inquiry telephone administrator of the telegraph bureau will designate the receiving and sending director, receiving and sending staff, or assistants familiar with business regulations to handle the duties in shifts day and night; in the telephone bureau, personnel familiar with business regulations will be designated to handle the duties. The above-mentioned administrators should respond quickly and in detail, use humble and sincere wording, and never use impatient or intolerant tones.

When external personnel use the business inquiry telephone, please first check the telephone number of the "Telegraph Business Inquiry Office," or "Telephone Business Inquiry Office," or "Joint Telegraph and Telephone Business Inquiry Office" in the telephone directory, and then use that number to inquire, and a satisfactory answer will be given.

### Instructions on the Examination of Long-Distance Telephone Regulations

It is found that Article 21, Paragraph 4 of the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations stipulates that if, after the caller registers, the line is congested, causing the ordinary call to wait for two hours, and the expedited call to wait for one hour, and the call still cannot be made, and a request is made to cancel the registration, no cancellation fee will be charged. However, for messenger calls, if the receiving bureau has already sent someone to call the recipient, the cancellation fee should still be charged. If the time when the caller requests cancellation is within the specified time, the cancellation fee must be charged. However, should the call bureau report the details of that record to the receiver bureau, completing the Receiver Bureau Fee Cancellation slip? Also, regarding messenger calls cancelled within the stipulated time, and at the same time, the sending bureau has not reported to the receiving bureau, should that call be counted as a fee-paying cancellation or a non-fee cancellation?

The above-mentioned items are not stipulated in the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations. It is heard that the Electricity Company has approved the following instructions:

㊀ If, after the caller registers, the expedited call waits for less than one hour, or the ordinary call waits for less than two hours, and a request is made to cancel the registration, regardless of the type of call or whether the receiving bureau has been notified, the cancellation fee should be charged. If the above-mentioned waiting time has been exceeded and the call still cannot be made, and a request is made to cancel the registration, except for messenger calls where the receiving bureau has already sent someone to call the recipient, where the cancellation fee should still be charged, all other types of calls, regardless of whether the receiving bureau has been notified, will be handled as a non-fee cancellation. ㊁ If the long-distance telephone has already notified the receiving bureau, when cancelling the registration, regardless of whether a cancellation fee is charged or not, the sending bureau should notify the receiving bureau to cancel the registration. However, if the receiving bureau has not been notified, there is no need to report.

### Opening a Garden in Prison

— Yan

Three years ago, I visited a prison in a small county town. It was just like what we see on stage, with wooden fences for doors, a dark room where no sunlight could penetrate, and a mixed, unpleasant odor that strongly attacked me, preventing me from staying for even a minute. Yet those criminals were sentenced to imprisonment and had to spend a long time in that dark room.

After that, I did not visit other prisons. Perhaps there are some that are a little more "humane" than the prison in that small county town. However, a reporter from a certain evening newspaper visited a model prison last year, but that interview report was still not satisfactory. Unfortunately, I don't have that newspaper at hand, otherwise I could excerpt a few sections to let readers who didn't pay attention to that interview report know some of the contents of the so-called model prison.

In the past, someone was concerned about the sexual desires of prisoners. I didn't pay attention to the result, but it was probably always "too highbrow and few followed." Originally, a free person committed a crime and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Besides hoping for the day of release and regaining freedom, they also hoped to suffer less hardship during the term. The prison cell is like hell, and the jailer is like a demon. Under such circumstances, sexual desire or not is only for the enjoyment of old masters who have three wives and four concubines. But suddenly someone is concerned about the sexual desires of prisoners, and the speculation is not without reason. It is said that in several prisons, prisoners are very disciplined, such as in work, rest, classes, and sleep. The prison was originally not just about imprisoning a criminal for a few months. It should reform him, educate him, so that after his term expires, he can come out and be a new person. This expectation is indeed too extravagant, so there is no discussion of sexual desire.

But the most basic condition is not to treat prisoners like pigs and sheep. A small cell houses dozens of people, eating and defecating there, with stench everywhere. Criminals who have lost their freedom should still be given some freedom within the law inside the prison. Recently, Meng Zhaogui, director of the Wenling District Court Prison, opened a small garden in the prison, planting flowers and trees for sick prisoners to admire, so that patients can easily eliminate the disease, because he saw that prisoners often develop epidemics and that living in prison cells inevitably caused depression and made it difficult for illnesses to heal. This is truly a rare piece of good news. Only the director of the prison knows best what the prison is like. Only the director of the prison knows best what suffering the prisoners endure. The reason why outsiders are concerned about the sexual desires of prisoners is that they can only see the surface of the prison, and they imagine what a prisoner who has lost his freedom needs most, which is often as laughable as "Why don't they eat meat porridge?"

Furthermore, the reason why Meng Zhaogui, director of the Wenling District Court Prison, opened a small garden in the prison is because he saw that prisoners often develop epidemics. Since prisoners often develop epidemics, it seems that the dark prison cells also need fundamental improvement. Opening a small garden is only a temporary solution. It is feared that "epidemics will often occur" inside the prison cells. Therefore, instead of treating the symptoms, it is better to treat the root cause. It is hoped that enlightened prison directors like Meng Zhaogui will do more for the prisoners.

### The Garden Watchman

— Wen Chong

The cherry trees bloomed with bright flowers at the end of December, slowly withering in the wind and rain, and soon turned into tender green fruits. At that time, the cherry orchard was still lonely. When the fruits on the treetops became heavy, drooping towards the ground, and slightly turning pink, the old garden watchman appeared in his pine wood house.

He was heavy and stout, and although his hair was white, he still retained the imposing manner of a soldier who had served for many years. His back was slightly hunched, and he wore an old egg-yolk-colored coat. He held a chipped and rusty bayonet in his hand. He also kept a small male dog, hairy, strong, like a mountain wolf. Usually, he always chained it up. Only at night, or when he heard any unusual movement in the cherry orchard, would he release it, gently whistle, point to the place where the unusual movement occurred with his finger. The dog would then understand, raise its tail, hold its head high, and run through the weeds, like a butterfly fluttering between the flowers, deftly shuttling through the cherry trees. Sometimes it would stop, prick up its ears, its nostrils squeaking, listening for any sound, and then jump forward in the same posture, patrolling the entire cherry orchard.

On the side of the pine wood house, the old garden watchman, gripping his chipped bayonet in one hand, sat on the steps with a frown, pricking up his ears, waiting. As soon as the warning bark sounded from the forest, he would suddenly stand up and stride towards the sound with his aging but still firm steps.

He was old and could not compete with those young peach thieves. However, he also had no intention of fighting them. For the five silver dollars a month he earned, he only wanted to scare them, to make them know when to stop, although he also knew that some people stole peaches from here to sell for a living. Anyway, the peaches they were stealing were not his own.

But his dog, Hehei, did not fully understand its master's intentions. When it discovered anything unfavorable to its master, it would bark a warning while fiercely wrinkling its nose, revealing its snow-white and sharp teeth, and pouncing on the peach thieves, hugging their waists, tearing their clothes with its teeth, until they ran, bare-assed, throwing away the bags in their hands, climbing over the mud wall, and disappearing at the corner of the wall. Hehei proudly raised its head and barked at the corner of the wall a few times before biting the bag dropped by the peach thieves and running back to the pine wood house.

On the way, the old garden watchman caught it, and it dropped the bag from its mouth, stuck out its tongue, squinted at him, wagged its tail, as if saying, "Dear, don't worry! I've chased him away for you!"

The old garden watchman stuck the bayonet in his hand into the ground, and then ran down, inspecting the retrieved bag in one hand and stroking Hehei's wet head in the other, murmuring with emotion, "Hehei, Hehei, my capable Hehei...!"

Hehei also stuck out its tongue and licked his face, or ran around him, vaguely barking, "Woof woof!"

In the evening, the old garden watchman stewed thin porridge in his casserole, and then went to the pergola to drive Hehei up, lit a small candle, and dined together in the hut. After the meal, he released Hehei to patrol the garden, then turned off the lights and lay down on the cool mat, and Hehei curled up on the ground not far from him, also sleeping soundly.

The cherry harvest was gradually approaching. The owner of the garden had come to inspect a few days ago, instructing the old man to be more careful. Hehei was almost always driven out of the pine wood house all night, and the old bayonet never left the old garden watchman's hand.

One day, Hehei went out to patrol as usual, when suddenly it cried mournfully and ran back to the pine wood house, rolling around in front of the old garden watchman, stretching out its foot to scratch its mouth, and soon died foaming at the mouth.

The old garden watchman cried frantically. He pried open its mouth to look and realized that it had been poisoned to death. From then on, his peaceful life was disrupted, and he no longer allowed his bayonet to rust. He thought to himself, "It's no longer time to be lenient!"

### White Horse Lake

— Wang Shengtian

The round trip trains from Ningbo to Baiguan have four daily sounds of whistles that are constantly disturbing this rural area, which is as pure as a virgin.

A winding lake, coldly piercing through this village; a winding lake, coldly piercing through this village; a corridor is just like a yellow silk belt going from this end of the village to that end of the village, several dignified mountain peaks, unevenly growing with green pine trees, tea trees, farmhouses, villas, schools, several small food shops...dotting this beautiful, picturesque village.

The people in this village are just as leisurely as those in deep, cold valleys; some of them don't want to move from their homes that they can rely on for decades, so they never leave this idyllic world for their entire lives. If you meet the old farmers with their dry tobacco sticks and tobacco pouches stuck in their backs and you greet them with a smile, they will very amiably ask you, "How are things on the outside now?"

In the evenings or on holidays, when the mist envelops the lake or when the sunlight shines on the lake, making it look yellow-gold woven into a chalk-white morning light, many people stand sparsely along the lake, thinking about their own stories, dreaming of being spoiled children embraced by nature. Several white ducks are swimming freely, preening their feathers when suddenly, a splash, a "splash" sound, scares the ducks on the lake, causing them to cry out in distress and panic, making "ya ya" sounds. This "ya ya" sound seems to be retaliating by saying, "If you want to show off your power, you must go to another world: Attacking when people are unprepared is despicable!" Then there is a burst of laughter.

Usually, when the sun rises, you can see many children wearing rural clothing, going to school noisily along the way. At noon and in the evening, they return home in the same mischievous way. This rural flavor will definitely make someone who has just arrived in this village smile and praise, "This is truly a rural area with both beautiful lakes and mountains!"

In the past few years, it's as if a demon's hand has grabbed the lifeblood of this beautiful, maiden-like village. Thus, this village has become emaciated, as emaciated as a piece of autumn straw, with only a little bit of bud growing under the roots!

The pine trees and tea trees on the mountains have gradually become sparse, as sparse as a bald head, with only a few hairs left. Because life can no longer be created, the old farmers with their dry tobacco roots and tobacco pouches stuck in their backs have, in the past few years, fallen like leaves on the hills and in the corners of the temples. The number of students in the school has decreased, and the small food shops are closed like it is deep at night. Many pessimists in the village say, "If the gods were not punishing us, why would we have changed so quickly? The Zhang family has disappeared, the Xia family's son has no way to eat...if demons were not playing tricks on us, we would have been very peaceful!"

The people of White Horse Lake are now like fish that have turned white in a pond on a hot day. They have no way to get cold, clean water. They can only flow into the gutter to die, or just stay alive in the pond.

However, in some people's eyes, this village, which has its throat grabbed by demons, is even more beautiful than before! The mill has been turned into a power plant. When dusk puts a piece of black cloth on the roofs of people's houses, the "thin" sound of the machinery earns many people's praise for the greatness of "machines," the omnipotence of science!

In this beautiful village, if, in the season of swaying willows, along the reflection of the electric light, the walls of the sacred villas are set off from the dark red lake surface, the temptation of the night, recalling many stories of this village in the past, the poet may praise the vicissitudes of the world, but if there is a dog with an owner sighing so sadly, that is something only gods would know!
