### The United States Agrees with Britain and France on a Joint Policy Towards China, US Diplomatic Personnel in China Ordered to Remain in Place

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] This side tacitly acknowledges that the United States has reached a joint policy towards China with Britain and France. An authoritative State Department official stated on the 27th that any future relations between US diplomatic personnel and the Chinese Communist Party in areas controlled by the CCP should not be viewed as a preliminary recognition of the CCP government. Since the United States is still maintaining diplomatic operations in Peiping, Tianjin, and Nanjing, it will inevitably have relations with the local CCP authorities. According to international law, such relations might be considered de facto recognition of these local authorities. Officials are extremely tight-lipped about reports that the US government is studying de facto recognition of the CCP government. They emphasize that only after the CCP formally establishes a government is it possible to consider the matter. Authoritative sources point out that the US consulates in Shenyang, Tianjin, and Peiping have not been closed, even though they are not doing any work. At the same time, even though the US ambassador's residence in Nanjing was invaded by the Communist army, the government has not considered closing the embassy or consulates. Therefore, at this time when Chiang Kai-shek has announced that he will continue fighting, the United States is clearly planning to implement a "presence" policy in China.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] A State Department spokesman announced on the 27th that all US diplomatic personnel in China have been ordered to remain in their current locations.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco broadcast on the 28th: The American ship (President Wilson), which may be the last to evacuate overseas Chinese, has left Shanghai for Japan.

### US Reaction to President Chiang's Proclamation Varies

[United Press, Washington, 27th] US officials and congressional leaders, in their reactions to President Chiang's proclamation on the 27th, stated that Chiang will devote himself to the struggle against the Communist Party. Supporters of Nationalist China believe that Chiang's proclamation is his courageous will to rally the people. Opponents believe that his proclamation is mere empty talk. Democratic Senator Humphrey said, "I hope what Chiang said about achieving victory within three years is correct. What he has announced is a noble purpose." Observers generally said that the proclamation did not state whether he would resume his actual leadership or simply express approval of Acting President Li and Premier He. Those familiar with the situation in China believe that Chiang announced his support for Li and He. Chinese sources said that the "three years" mentioned in the proclamation may be an expression and does not refer to three years. They explained that "three years" is the shortest time frame that Chinese people use in this kind of situation. Observers said that Chiang's proclamation is telling all those loyal to Chiang to also be loyal to Li and He. They expect that when the line of resistance is well laid out in southern China, Chiang can be expected to take over the leadership of the defense.

### US Aid Cotton Continues to Supply Raw Materials Needed by Shanghai Yarn Mills, Statement by Griffin, Acting Director of ECA China Division

[United States Information Service, Economic Cooperation Administration, This City Dispatch, 28th] "For such time as the port remains open and the city of Shanghai is not under Communist control, the ECA China Mission stands prepared to support the operations of Shanghai's cotton mills with US aid cotton."

We recognize the importance to the life of Shanghai of the productivity of this industry and the number of people it employs. I wish to correct the misunderstanding caused by reports that the ECA is abandoning plans for shipping US cotton to Shanghai."

### "Mother of Guerrillas" Zhao Laotaitai Escapes Danger; Today Flies from Qingdao to Shanghai, then to Guangzhou

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th] Zhao Hongwenguo, the elderly Mrs. Zhao, known as the "Mother of Guerrillas," recently escaped danger from Pingdu and arrived here. The women's community of Qingdao held a tea party this afternoon to welcome her. She is from Andong Yan County, now 69 years old. Her eldest son, Zhao Lianjun, was killed by the Japanese in the Northeast on the 28th. Her second son, Zhao Tong, was killed by the communists in the same year. Her third daughter, Zhao Lizhong, was also killed in Zanhuang County, Hebei. After the "September 18th" Incident, Mrs. Zhao helped her second son, Zhao Tong, organize volunteer troops in her hometown. Later, under Japanese pressure, she fled to Beiping. After the outbreak of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, she helped Zhao Tong organize guerrillas in the suburbs of Beiping, personally transporting ammunition and intelligence. The Japanese pursued her too closely, making it impossible to establish a foothold in Beiping. She moved to Jigong Mountain in Henan and organized a guerrilla force of more than forty people. After crossing the Yellow River northward, the number grew to more than two thousand. Later, the Japanese army concentrated all its forces to encircle and suppress them, and only nine people remained in the entire team. She then continued to organize guerrillas in Hankou and went north for the second time. The highest authorities, considering that Mrs. Zhao was too old to endure hardship, asked her to stay in the rear and carry out propaganda work until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. This time, she witnessed the actions of the communists in Beiping and was greatly disappointed. She then fled with her fourth son, Zhao Zhenzhong. She is scheduled to fly to Shanghai tomorrow and then transfer to Guangzhou.

### The Peace Negotiation Delegation Failed to Return South; The Executive Yuan Announces the Truth; Person in Charge Says the Delegation Has Been Effectively Detained; Five Representatives' Letter to President He Is Published

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th] Since the Communist Party sabotaged the peace talks, all parties have been extremely concerned about when the government's peace negotiation delegation will return south. For this reason, the reporter inquired with responsible persons of the Executive Yuan and learned that after Mao Zedong and Zhu De sabotaged the peace talks on the 21st of this month by issuing a general offensive order, Acting President Li and President He of the government telegraphed the Beiping peace negotiation delegation on the 22nd, informing them that a plane would be sent to pick them up and instructing them to contact the Communist side to arrange a departure date. On the evening of the 22nd, Acting President Li also spoke to Mr. Zhang Zhizhong on a long-distance telephone, informing him that a plane would be sent the next day, until the special plane was recalled from the air. On the 24th, the government again sent a plane from Shanghai to Beiping. President He also entrusted Mr. Li Mingxin, who was taking the plane to Beiping, to carry letters addressed separately to Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and others, hoping that they would return south immediately. When the plane flew back from Beiping on the 25th, it carried back a letter signed by five representatives, including Zhang Zhizhong, stating that the Communist side had expressed "resolute retention and unwillingness to agree" regarding the government's peace negotiation delegation being recalled to the south. In this situation, it is sufficient to prove that the government's peace negotiation representatives in Beiping have been effectively detained by the Communist Party. Therefore, the Executive Yuan decided at the Yuan meeting on the 27th to revoke the name of the peace negotiation delegation. In the future, the Communist Party may use the name of the government's peace negotiation representatives to carry out malicious propaganda. In an environment where the representatives have lost their freedom, any remarks issued in their name will undoubtedly be false. In order to explain the truth of the matter, the five representatives' personal letter is specially published below: "Respected President He: Mr. Li Mingxin brought your note (of the 23rd), which we have received with respect. After the breakdown of the peace talks, we were awaiting orders to return south. In the evening of the 22nd, we received a telephone call from De Gong (Li Zongren), stating that a plane would be sent to Beiping the next day. We immediately informed our colleagues and prepared to go south, and immediately sent a letter to the Communist side for their information. Subsequently, Zhou Enlai, Lin Zuhan, Li Lisan, and others visited us separately, resolutely urging us to stay. We telegraphed Nanjing twice on the 22nd and 23rd, and made telephone inquiries in the morning of the 23rd, but were unable to get through. Yesterday, we read that the Central Company had a plane coming to Beiping, and we again consulted with the Communist side, stating our reasons for needing to return south, hoping that they would agree. However, Zhou still resolutely urged us to stay and was unwilling to agree. In this situation, we can only stay temporarily and wait quietly, hoping for your understanding. Furthermore, we failed to complete our mission on this trip, but we are deeply ashamed and grateful for the letters and telegrams of comfort from Acting President Li and you, sir. Please also convey our sentiments to De Gong. With respectful greetings, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, Li Zheng, Liu Fei, respectfully. At one o'clock in the morning of April 25th."

The peace talks in Beiping, which lasted for more than a month, have unfortunately broken down, and the Communist army, which was stationed north of the Yangtze River, has forcibly crossed the river, and the war has moved from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south. The resumption of civil war not only greatly disappoints the people who longed for peace, but also makes the people of the south feel even heavier; coupled with the fact that the Communist army's general offensive has lasted less than a few days, the National Army has successively abandoned cities such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou due to strategic reasons. The flames of war are gradually moving eastward, less than seventy kilometers away from Shanghai. The rapid turn for the worse in the military situation has made the citizens of Shanghai panic, and they are in a state of anxiety. The streets and alleys are filled with wartime scenes, the airport, the ship docks are crowded with people, piled high with luggage, everyone wants to be the first to fly away; not to mention the residents of the suburbs of Shanghai, who are also supporting the old and carrying the young, carrying baskets and suitcases, moving into the urban area, heading to what they think is a safe place. No matter how clear his reason is, no matter how strong his will is, in the face of the current situation of turmoil and shock, he cannot help but feel frightened and sleepless, and even if he wants to remain calm, he cannot. Therefore, everyone thinks that a great disaster is imminent, and the country has reached the final moment, but they do not know how to save themselves and save the country from peril. Therefore, the people's hearts are filled with anxiety, worry, distress, and bewilderment.

But after reading President Chiang's "Letter to the People of the Whole Country" yesterday, the people's feelings of anxiety, worry, distress, and bewilderment suddenly disappeared. It made the people of the whole country understand that although the sky is covered with haze, President Chiang also admits the seriousness of the current situation, and even predicts that the situation will worsen in the future; but the future of the country is bright, and there will be a day when the crisis turns into safety, and the sunshine of peace will surely dispel the war and haze and shine brightly. However, whether a turning point can come depends on the joint efforts of the entire nation, especially the people's efforts to save the nation from peril. After reading President Chiang's proclamation, we were filled with emotion, and we really didn't know where to start; but speaking from the people's standpoint, we couldn't help but hope that the government would earnestly abide by President Chiang's instructions, redouble its efforts, so that this battered ship could weather the storm and safely reach the other shore.

President Chiang said: "Today, as long as our compatriots across the country rise up together, support the government, urge the government, so that politics has timely reforms, the economy has a certain direction, and military and political cadres can thoroughly awaken and strengthen the organization; as long as we accept the lessons of failure, so that failure becomes a tempering and refining, ... I am deeply convinced that the opportunity for our country to turn from danger to safety is today." This passage, although said to the people of the whole country, is actually aimed at the government. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War four years ago, the military has suffered successive defeats, from the Northeast to North China, from north of the Yangtze River to the south. After each military defeat, the government always reiterated its determination to reform politics, but each time the result was always disappointing to the people, and the checks that were issued were never cashed, and the style remained the same. Now it has reached the final moment, and the military cannot afford to fail again, otherwise the country will fall into an irrecoverable situation; but everyone knows that politics, military affairs, and economy are three-in-one, and cannot be separated. If the government still cannot make a painful decision and thoroughly reform, so that the whole country has a new look, then it will still be difficult for the military to have hope of turning from weakness to strength. Failure is not worth worrying about, especially the victory or defeat in military affairs, in the eyes of military experts, it is commonplace, and there is no need to fear. Everyone knows the saying "Failure is the mother of success"; but the most terrible thing is "not knowing shame" and "not being able to accept the lessons of failure." Government officials should be particularly vigilant about the President's instructions and reflect on them a lot.

In short, military failure is not worth worrying about, the most worrying thing is still the lack of political reform. Let's take a historical example. Le Yi attacked Qi and captured more than seventy cities in a row, leaving only the two cities of Ju and Jimo; but when Tian Dan came out, he restored the old mountains and rivers of Qi. Comparing the past with the present is like comparing the present with the past. We should not be pessimistic, but should be active and enterprising, make a painful decision, and reform politics, and we will eventually be able to achieve the task of saving the nation from peril. Therefore, whether the country can turn from danger to safety in the future will also depend on whether the current government can accept the lessons of failure and thoroughly reform politics. President Chiang said: "The failures of the past were caused by our political shortcomings, economic panic, and the laxity of internal organization"; these self-critical maxims are most worthy of deep reflection by the officials in power. The time is urgent and has reached the final moment, and the entire nation should rise up and save the situation. This is the time.

### The United States and the Soviet Union Negotiate to Lift the Berlin Blockade, Reaching the Final Decision Stage; The United States Asks the Soviet Union to Submit a Definite Timetable; Jessup and Malik Held Secret Talks for Ninety-Two Minutes

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Negotiations between the East and West on lifting the Berlin blockade reached the final decision stage today, and the next action is entirely up to the Soviet Union. It is expected that the Soviet Union will soon respond to the questions of the United States, Britain, and France, that is, whether the only condition for the Soviet Union to end the Berlin blockade is that the United States, Britain, and France agree to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers. The United States, Britain, and France have indicated that they are willing to attend the meeting once Berlin returns to normal.

[Reuters, New York, 27th] The United States has asked the Soviet Union today to issue a formal statement stating when and under what conditions the Soviet Union will lift the Berlin blockade. The US representative to the United Nations, Jessup, made this request to the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and representative to the United Nations, Malik, tonight, stating that its main purpose was to put the Berlin negotiations on a formal basis and to record the Soviet Union's views in formal documents. The note also specifically asked the Soviet Union to explain the scope of the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the timetable for lifting the blockade. Previously, sources revealed that the US and Soviet representatives were discussing this issue. The US representative will reiterate the positions of the United States, Britain, and France on lifting the blockade and convening a meeting of foreign ministers. Officials here are cautiously optimistic about this matter, believing that the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the convening of a meeting of foreign ministers are expected to be realized within one to two months.

[United Press, New York, 27th] US Representative Jessup and Soviet Deputy Foreign Ministers Gromyko and Malik held secret talks for ninety-two minutes this morning on the third floor of the Soviet delegation office on Upper Pike Road. It is reported that Mr. Jessup presented a memorandum requesting the Soviet Union to clearly explain the conditions for lifting the Berlin blockade. According to a spokesman for the US delegation, what Mr. Jessup presented was not a note in diplomatic terms. Mr. Jessup only read a pre-prepared document, and left the document behind before leaving, asking the Soviet side to respond in writing. Mr. Jessup arrived at the Soviet delegation office alone by car, and entered through the iron gate, and there was no news. After the meeting, he returned to the US delegation office alone. A few minutes later, Gromyko went to Success Lake to attend a committee of the United Nations General Assembly, keeping silent about the content of the secret talks. When reporters asked Malik if there was any news to announce, he replied no, and when the next negotiation will be held is also unknown. The US side said that the talks are only informal in nature so far, and the date of the next negotiation can be arranged temporarily by telephone.

[US Information Service, New York, 27th] After meeting with Malik, Mr. Jessup immediately consulted with British and French officials in New York, and then returned to Washington. Previously, Mr. Jessup had consulted with the US Chief Representative to the United Nations, Austin, and other members of the delegation that day. It is still unknown what the outcome of the negotiations between Malik and Jessup will be, but United Nations officials welcomed the fact that the two sides used the United Nations' convenience here. United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi said: "The whole world will welcome the smooth outcome of this effort to break the Berlin deadlock and the convening of another meeting of foreign ministers. I think most people will also feel gratified that the two major countries are using the path of the United Nations, and the efforts of the two countries to successfully complete the agreement in 1945 led to the establishment of the United Nations."

### Representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union May Hold a Meeting Within the Week to Determine the Date of Lifting the Berlin Blockade and Holding a Meeting of Foreign Ministers

[This newspaper's report] New York, 28th, broadcast: Success Lake report: Western diplomats expect that representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will hold talks within the week to determine the date of lifting the Berlin blockade and convening a meeting of the four powers' foreign ministers. They expect the foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Paris in the last week of May.

They confirmed that the Soviet representative, Malik, had verbally assured the US representative, Jessup, that if the Western countries agreed to lift the counter-blockade at the same time, the Soviet Union would definitely lift the Berlin blockade and agree to convene a meeting of the four powers' foreign ministers on a regular basis. Malik asked for time to obtain formal approval from Vyshinsky. Malik arrived in Flushing to attend a plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and avoided answering questions about the progress of the Berlin issue negotiations, but when asked if he was optimistic, Malik replied: "We Soviets have always been optimistic."

### US Assistant Secretary of State Meets with Gromyko for Informal Talks on the Berlin Issue

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] US Assistant Secretary of State Rusk flew from Washington to New York today to meet with Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister and Chief Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Gromyko, to hold informal talks on the Berlin blockade issue. Since the US Representative to the United Nations, Jessup, and the Soviet Representative to the United Nations, Malik, have already exchanged views on this matter, the meeting between Rusk and Gromyko is a contact between the two countries at a higher level on this matter.

### During Negotiations Between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Mood in Moscow Is Excellent; Relations Between the Four Powers Will Enter a New Stage

[United Press, Moscow, 27th] The general mood here today is that relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France can be improved and reach a new post-war stage. Although no one can predict what kind of liberation methods will be established in addition to lifting the Berlin blockade, well-informed diplomats believe that the lifting of the Berlin blockade may become the beginning of a major development. If all parties can handle it well, this new trend may lead to the end of the Cold War. Western countries are often skeptical of any new actions taken by the Soviet Union in the Cold War, but this time is an exception. Some aspects of the United States even said, "A situation is brewing, and its smell is not bad." Western observers say that the situation is delicate, and new steps should be taken cautiously and with more thought.

### The German Road Bureau Prepares to Resume Passenger and Freight Transport to Berlin; Signs of Lifting the Blockade Are Emerging

[Reuters, Hanover, 27th] The director of the German Railway Bureau, Sordo, declared here: The Road Bureau is prepared to immediately begin restoring passenger and freight transport to Berlin after the Berlin blockade is lifted, and will give priority to restoring the operation of coal trucks. In addition, the first bus to leave Berlin has arrived here. According to reports, when it arrived at the Soviet border, Soviet officials were very polite to the passengers, and only detained them for half an hour before continuing westward. Previously, passengers coming from Berlin had to change trains at the border.

### The States of the Federal Republic of West Germany Establish a System of Separation of Powers

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 27th] It is reported that the economic balancing power of the Federal Republic of West Germany, which will be established this summer, will be in the hands of the central government, but the states will also have considerable administrative independence. The establishment of this system of separation of powers is the result of the Social Democratic Party's efforts in the eight months of constitutional drafting. The party overcame the resolute opposition of the Christian Democratic Party, regardless of the opposition of the United States and France, and achieved the goal of concentrating the economic power of the German Federal Republic.

### Acheson Urges the US Senate to Approve the Atlantic Treaty; The Treaty Is Still Needed Even If the Berlin Blockade Is Lifted

[US Information Service, Washington, 27th] Secretary of State Acheson said: Even if the Berlin blockade is lifted, the need for the North Atlantic Treaty still exists. Acheson testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the North Atlantic Treaty today, stating that the issue of the Soviet blockade of the former capital of Germany is one part of the major problems in Europe. He criticized the tendency of some people in the United States to link the policies of the United States and the actions of the Soviet Union in Europe. He pointed out that this would allow the Soviet Union to always maintain the initiative, and in fact the United States should not be affected by the Soviet Union's peace offensive, nerve warfare, or propaganda. When asked what countermeasures the Soviet Union might take after the United States approved the Atlantic Treaty, the Secretary of State was unwilling to speculate. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's propaganda against the Atlantic Treaty has been strengthened, and protests have been issued, and he said that he expects the same actions to continue. In response to other questions, Acheson said that the Ruhr area is not intended to be restored as a source of military supplies for the signatory countries to the treaty. He said that the disarmament and abolition of armaments in Germany will continue to be carried out, and this is obvious.

### British Commonwealth Conference Ends, Prime Ministers Return Home One After Another; India Does Not Intend to Pledge Allegiance to the British Monarch After Independence

[Reuters, London, 28th] The Prime Ministers of the Dominions, after attending the Commonwealth Conference, departed for home one after another today. The agreement reached at this meeting on the relationship between India and the Commonwealth has been well received in various parts of the Commonwealth. A dispatch from New Delhi said that after learning of the results of the Commonwealth Conference, Indian Deputy Prime Minister Patel said that the Indian National Congress and the Parliament would approve it immediately. A dispatch from Canberra said that the Australian government also praised India's continued participation in the British Commonwealth, but reserved its opinion on the point that India does not have to pledge allegiance to the British monarch. Canadian sources believe that the acquisition of this new formula is Addlee's condition. Newspaper commentary also pointed out that after Ireland completely separated from the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth seemed to be disintegrating, but this decision on India can maintain the permanence of the Commonwealth's ties. The London newspapers all expressed joy at this new resolution, and some even believed that this precedent could induce Ireland and Burma to rejoin the embrace of the Commonwealth. The Social Party's enlightened policy has made the British Commonwealth last for at least another century.

[United Press, London, 28th] India used diplomatic revolution to decide today to become an independent and autonomous republic, but still be a part of the British Commonwealth. India today gained the result of breaking away from the British Empire by means of an announcement. According to the communique, India agreed to continue to recognize the British monarch as the symbol of the free combination of the Commonwealth's independent members and the head of the Commonwealth. However, the communique did not mention allegiance to the British monarch. India may adopt a new constitution in August and declare itself a republic, at which time the Indian people will probably only pledge allegiance to the Republic of India. A government spokesman declared that the British monarch would no longer appoint a governor-general to administer India, but would send a high commissioner to India as his representative. The Anglo-Indian agreement was mostly obtained due to the warm relationship between British Prime Minister Addlee and Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

This article prohibits Austria from claiming from Germany any Austrian property seized before the German annexation of Austria. The four Foreign Minister representatives agreed that Austrian private property in Germany should be returned to the Austrians and stipulated that the future Treaty with Germany should also prohibit Germany from claiming from Austria property taken from Germany by Austria. The Soviet representative, Sarupin, disagreed with this point, believing that the issue of Germany claiming property from foreign countries had already been stipulated in the Four-Power Agreement on Germany, and therefore did not need to be stipulated in the Treaty with Germany. The US representative, Li Bo, replied that the Four-Power Control Committee for Germany had long ceased its activities, and that he and the British and French representatives were willing to have this point specified in the Treaty with Germany.

### Living Index Compilation Review Committee Agrees to Compile Separate Salary Index; Adopts Average of Twice-Daily Highest Commodity Prices

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Living Expense Index Compilation Review Committee held a meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Industry Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Statistics Office, and the Social Affairs Bureau, a total of more than ten people, attended. During the meeting, all representatives agreed that the compilation of the living expense index was absolutely correct. However, due to the recent soaring prices, the gap between wages and prices has widened, and workers are finding it increasingly difficult to make a living. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the salary system and payment methods. After discussion between labor and management representatives, it was decided that the living index for each period would still be compiled and published according to the original method, and the original average index would continue to be published in order to conform to scientific principles. As for the salary standard, a separate "Salary Index" will be compiled, and the average of the two highest commodity prices on the survey day for each period will be used as the commodity price adopted by the "Salary Index", so that the wages converted by the salary index in the future can be closer to the commodity prices. As for how to determine the standard for the highest commodity survey day for each period, it is proposed to submit it to the Municipal Government Conference for decision.

Another meeting will be held at 2:00 PM this afternoon to decide on implementation. The preliminary principles decided at yesterday's meeting are as follows: (1) Request the National Bank to try its best to prepare and issue 50% to 70% of the cash. (2) Issue silver dollars together. (3) Sell gold to absorb cash. (4) Distribute goods (factory's manufactured products).

### National Bank Decides to Appropriately Increase Cash for Salaries and Allowances

As for the method of exchanging gold for Yuan Datou silver dollars, which was implemented for a while in the middle of the month, if the cash is not enough at that time and there is a need for it, it will be considered whether to resume it.
