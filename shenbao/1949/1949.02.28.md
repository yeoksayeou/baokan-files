### Yan Huiqing and Others Return to the Capital; CCP Representative Candidates Largely Decided; Peace Talks May Begin in Beiping in Mid-March

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, and their party returned directly to the capital from Beiping, greatly strengthening the hope for peace. Although the representatives of various government factions avoided answering specific questions about the peace talks after returning to Nanjing, this reporter learned from reliable sources through unofficial channels that the CCP has agreed to hold peace talks with the government. The candidates for the CCP representatives are under consideration and have been largely decided. Once announced in the shortest possible time, peace negotiations will begin in Beiping in mid-March. This is the greatest achievement of the peace delegation's trip to Beiping and Shijiazhuang. The letter from Mao Zedong to Acting President Li is of particular importance, and it is generally believed that it will have a significant impact on the future of the peace talks.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Shanghai Peace Delegation, consisting of Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi, traveled to Beiping in their private capacities to exchange views with CCP leaders on peace talk issues. After two weeks, they returned to Nanjing from Beiping on the Central Air Transport Corporation's special plane (537) at 2:15 PM on the 27th. The special plane landed at Ming Palace Airport, where government leaders in Nanjing went to the airport to welcome them. Acting President Li also sent his Chief of Staff, Li Yuqing, to greet them on his behalf. After the plane landed, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shijian, Shao Lizi, and Jiang Yong disembarked in turn, shaking hands with each of the welcoming personnel. All four, Yan, Jiang, Zhang, and Shao, were wearing long gowns with overcoats. Their facial expressions were all very happy. When shaking hands with the welcoming personnel, they repeatedly praised the weather today. When Elder Yan shook hands with Yu Youren, he said, "The weather is really good today. The wind is strong and with us, so we flew here in just over three hours." Elder Shao, with a smiling face, shook hands with the welcoming personnel even more frequently. He then issued a written statement, which was read by Shao Lao's secretary, Zhang Fengzhou, in the airport lounge (see separate article). The representatives were photographed by a reporter named Hua Baoguo at the airport, and after exchanging pleasantries with the welcoming personnel, they took cars prepared by the Presidential Palace to the Capital Hotel for rest and lunch. Those who went to the airport to welcome them on the 27th included Acting President Li's representative, Li Yuqing, as well as Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Tong Guanxian, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, He Yaozu, Li Dachao, Gui Yongqing, Zhang Yaoming, Zhang Zhen, Li Chongshi, Yuan Yongcheng, Qiu Changwei, Huang Yuren, Cui Shuqin, and dozens of others.

We were also invited to Shijiazhuang and received by CCP Chairman Mao Zedong and General Zhou Enlai, with whom we exchanged views extensively on the issue of peace. We deeply feel that although there are still many difficulties in the future of the peace talks, hopes are high. The mission of this trip can be said to be over, so we are returning south and intend to report to Acting President Li before returning to Shanghai. In Beiping and Shijiazhuang, agreement was reached in principle on the issues of facilitating air and postal communications between the North and the South. We are also grateful for the sincere hospitality of the CCP leaders. Yan Huiqing (signed), Jiang Yong (signed), Zhang Shichuan (signed), Shao Lizi (signed)."

He first stated that he would not answer any questions about the peace issue outside the scope of the written statement. The reporter then asked the peace elder, who had traveled tirelessly on the road from Beiping to Nanjing, the following questions:

Q: Mr. Shao, how many times did you and Mr. Mao Zedong talk in Shijiazhuang?

A: We talked twice, and the time was quite long.

Q: Was your freedom of movement protected in Beiping?

A: Meeting guests and being guests were both very free.

Q: Can you tell us more about the air and postal communications?

A: Air communications (including ships and airplanes) have been largely resolved and can carry passengers, but the specific methods still need to be studied by experts. Mail can be loaded on the next ship.

Q: How was life in Beiping?

A: Several old gentlemen are in good health and spirits. The CCP's hospitality was especially warm. This time, we encountered favorable winds on our return trip, and we all have a good impression of Beiping.

Q: Is General Fu Zuoyi in good health?

A: Yes. At this time, the waiter had prepared Western food and waited for Elder Shao to eat. Shao suddenly had a thought, turned around and said to the reporter, "There is news I can tell you. I have already met with a group of friends in Panyang, including Shen Junru and Guo Moruo, more than forty people." After speaking, he went to the newspaper rack to get a newspaper and saw the news of the announcement of the new economic plan. Shao said, "We didn't know about these things in Beiping."

If the statutory number of attendees for the resumption is exceeded, it will not affect the resumption, so they do not intend to attend this session.

### Financial and Monetary Reform Plan; Implementation Rules to Be Announced Soon; Liu Gongyun Returns to Shanghai from Guangzhou Yesterday

### Miscellaneous Notes on the Peace Delegates' Arrival in Nanjing: The Four Elders All Gained Weight, Bringing Back Many Private Letters; Mao Zedong Used Playing Cards as a Metaphor, Expressing Willingness for Peace

— …Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th…

After the peace delegation took off from Shanghai on the 13th, it arrived in Qingdao on the same day. Due to a burst airplane tire, they were delayed in Qingdao for one day. Only after they arrived in Beiping the next day did they learn that Ye Jianying and Xu Bing had been waiting for them at the airport on the afternoon of the 13th, but returned to the city at 7 PM. The reason for their absence was unknown, and Ye and others expressed great anxiety. On the 14th, the delegation arrived at Beiping's Xiyuan Airport by plane, where they were welcomed by Representative Xu Bing. That evening, they attended a banquet at Ye Jianying's invitation. On the morning of the 27th, before the delegation departed from Beiping, Shao Lizi once again exchanged opinions on peace issues with Li Jishen, Zhang Bojun, and Shen Junru. They boarded the plane at 11:15 AM. When they departed, Ye Jianying, Xu Bing, and others went to the airport to see them off.

When the peace plane landed at the capital airport at 2:20 PM on the 27th, the fuselage swayed slightly, apparently due to insufficient air in the tires, as there was no large inflation equipment available at the time in Beiping.

As the door of the plane opened, Shao Lao was inside the cabin. Before his face was seen, his laughter was heard. Welcoming personnel said, "Shao Lao is laughing, so the peace talks must be optimistic."

When the peace delegation departed from Beiping, Ye Jianying and others presented them with many items of fruit, pastries, and cigarettes. Deng Baoshan and others also presented each member with generous gifts, including jars of Beiping pickles, Laojiao wine from Shijiazhuang, and Yantai apples—everything one could wish for.

The "Liberation Tobacco" brought back by the delegation included brands such as Elephant and Sea Swallow, produced by the New China Tobacco Company. The packaging of the twenty-cigarette packs was quite poor, with the words "Registered Trademark of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government Industry and Commerce Bureau" printed on them.

Attendants of the delegation offered "Liberation Cigarettes" to guests at the Capital Hotel. The taste was mild, but they were quite difficult to smoke.

The delegation members brought back many private letters, evoking a sense of "a letter from home is worth a thousand pieces of gold after three thousand miles of war."

On the 26th, the delegation members had lunch at the China Restaurant of the Six Nations Hotel with representatives from the Communist side and our personnel stationed in Beiping. The group photograph included Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, Shao Lizi, Dong Biwu (Communist side), Deng Baoshan, Ye Jianying (Communist side), Lin Biao (Communist side), Fu Zuoyi, Bo Yibo (Communist side), Xu Bing (Communist side), Nie Rongzhen (Communist side), Guo Zongfen, Chuan Daocang, Gu Lecun, Jin Anqing, Tao Zhu (Communist side), Zhang Fengzhou, Jiao Xiangzong, the co-pilot Lu, Pan Boying, Jin Shan, Jiao [blank], Zhou Beifeng, Huang Qihan, Rong Zihe (Communist side), Liu Zhonghua (two people), Chen Weiwen (pilot), and Dian Zhongren—29 people in total.

Judging from the photograph, the British coat of arms was still in place in the Six Nations Hotel. The hands of the clock pointed to 2:10, and it was said that the clock had stopped running long ago.

General Fu Zuoyi wore a cotton military uniform without shoulder marks or collar insignia, and shallow Chinese shoes. He appeared slightly thinner.

During the two weeks in Beiping, the only time the Kuomintang flag was seen was on Deng Baoshan's hat badge.

There were many cars in Beiping. Vehicles were constantly prepared in front of the Six Nations Hotel to solve the transportation problems of the delegation members. When the vehicles came and went, the drivers always asked, "Are you waiting for a while? What time should I come to pick you up?" Their attitude was friendly.

Yan Huiqing's private doctor, Jiao Xiangzong, became the joint medical consultant for the four elders. However, no one sought his medical attention during the two weeks. They did not feel any discomfort when boarding or disembarking.

The four elders all gained weight compared to before they went to Beiping, indicating that the nutrition there was very good.

The Communist side's hospitality in Beiping was extensive. Chinese and Western food was available. Shao Lao found it difficult to get used to and asked for vegetarian dishes, after which his meals gradually increased.

A glimpse of the gold market: ten US dollars exchanged for fifteen silver dollars. One silver dollar exchanged for 300 gold yuan, and one silver dollar exchanged for ten people's yuan.

On the eve of their departure from Beiping, Cheng Yanqiu was performing *Suo Lin Nang*. Although the delegation members wanted to hear the famous play, they had to forgo the pleasure because they were busy preparing for the trip.

The families of Jiang Yong and Zhang Shizhao were all in Beiping. When they arrived in Beiping, they went home to see their families and found that nothing was missing, which made them very happy.

Some dance halls in Beiping have reopened, staying open all night. People only leave when their enthusiasm wanes. However, there are no professional dance hostesses. Temporary partners need to be found on the black market.

The city's telephone lines have been restored, and soldiers buy tickets for transportation and theater.

It is said that when Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi met with Mao Zedong in Shijiazhuang, Mao's first words expressing his willingness for peace were using playing cards as a metaphor. He said, "We've been playing cards for so long, it's time to stop."

The four representatives agreed not to reveal the specific content of their talks in Beiping and Shijiazhuang. Except for Shao Lizi, who met with reporters, the other three did not meet with reporters. Shao Lizi advised the reporters, "For the sake of peace, you should sacrifice some reporting. The less you publish, the better."

The written statement of the four representatives was drafted by Zhang Fengzhou's secretary. Regarding the future of the peace talks, two sentences were initially written as "We deeply feel that although there are many difficulties in the future of the peace talks, there is great hope." After deliberation by the four peace elders, it was changed to "We deeply feel that although there are still many difficulties in the future of the peace talks, there is great hope," reflecting their cautiousness.

Mao Zedong Sends a Letter to Acting President Li, Presenting His Views on Current Issues

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] It is reported that CCP Chairman Mao Zedong has sent a letter to Acting President Li, presenting his views on current issues. The letter has been brought to Nanjing by Yan Huiqing and others for submission.

Editorial

### The Psychological Foundation of Peace Talks

The four peace elders, Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, flew back to Nanjing from Beiping yesterday afternoon and issued a written statement, the gist of which was that they "deeply feel that although there are still many difficulties in the future of the peace talks, there is great hope." With this result, the four elders' half-month trip can be considered worthwhile. Their "door-knocking work" for national peace is not only gratifying to Acting President Li, but also appreciated by the citizens of Nanjing and Shanghai and the people of the whole country for their tireless efforts.

During these two weeks, in addition to giving an important broadcast to rectify official conduct and military discipline, Acting President Li also made a southern tour, visiting the provincial capitals of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, making known to officials and civilians in various places his greatest sincerity and boundless confidence in striving for overall peace. He had several very moving words, namely: "Today, all comrades of the Kuomintang must thoroughly examine the factors of failure. Failure is the mother of success, and we must not lose heart. We hope to unite to seek true peace... We are definitely not doing it for the positions of a few people, but for the purpose of achieving true peace for our four hundred million compatriots." Now, Acting President Li has returned to Nanjing, and Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan is also expected to fly to Nanjing today. Other high officials from various places have also been invited to Beijing one after another. In the coming days, there will be very important consultations in the capital. Of course, the issue of how to proceed with the peace talks should be the top priority for the authorities to consult on.

Standing from the people's perspective, we yearn for peace and will naturally exceed any authority on both sides. Hearing the words of the peace elders, "Many difficulties, great hope," we cannot help but sincerely implore both sides to quickly work hard to overcome the various difficulties before the realization of peace talks. The most important work to overcome difficulties is to jointly build the psychological foundation of peace talks.

In all matters under heaven, whether big or small, the motivation stems from people's initial thought. This thought is the psychological tendency of one person or even a group of people. What the heart desires is called ambition, and those with ambition will succeed. Therefore, warfare has the will to fight, and seeking peace must have the will to seek peace. We believe that Acting President Li, after President Chiang Kai-shek resolutely stepped down to seek peace, endured humiliation and continued to seek the realization of peace, truly has the will to seek peace. On the Communist side, Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the CCP, and other gentlemen also extensively exchanged views on peace issues with the four peace elders, which shows that they also have the will to seek peace. Since both sides have the will to seek peace, then no matter how many difficulties may be encountered in the tortuous process, we always hope that the authorities on both sides must stand on a solid psychological foundation to overcome them. Then, what materials should the authorities on both sides use to build the psychological foundation for peace talks? We believe that the four great words of 公 (fairness), 容 (tolerance), 忍 (forbearance), and 悲 (compassion) are the psychological foundation of peace talks.

First, there must be "fairness." The Three Principles of the People advocated by the Kuomintang are for the purpose of saving the country and the people; the New Democracy currently advocated by the Communist Party is for the purpose of "liberating" the people. If both are truly for the people, it is best to have no self-interest. Being for the people is fairness, and being for oneself is selfishness. Only by being "fair" can one "share" (共); only then can there be "harmony" (和). How can there be "sharing" and "harmony" without fairness? As long as there is true fairness, no one will be willing to oppose. As long as one is truly and fairly for the people, without discrimination against all good people, one can gain the understanding of the other side and the love of the people. As long as one can truly do what Acting President Li said, "not for the positions of a few people but for four hundred million compatriots," under such a selfless attitude, there will naturally be no party grievances. If so, the government should of course thoroughly implement its seven measures, and the CCP does not have to arrest war criminals and suppress newspapers in its jurisdiction. Therefore, starting from the point of "fairness," the conditions proposed by both sides can of course be placed on the great scale of "Is it for the people?" to weigh, and it is believed that all doubts can be dispelled, and a ceasefire and peace talks can be achieved immediately. How beneficial this would be to the people in dire straits!

Second, there must be "tolerance." Since one wants to seek peace, one must of course know oneself and the other, benefit oneself and others, and especially benefit all people. Only in this way, in the process of seeking peace, must the authorities on both sides broaden their minds, accept the other side's reasonable opinions, and even accept the people's reasonable demands. What Acting President Li said in Hankou, hoping that the Kuomintang would lean a little to the left and the Communist Party would lean a little to the right, is probably close to the spirit of mutual accommodation. As the Confucianists said, "All things grow together without harming each other," "Tacit agreement is enough to achieve harmony," and "Respect the mother, do not only think of oneself," etc., are all teaching people not to harbor the idea of ​​being the only one who is right, and not to cling to one's own prejudices and obliterate everything. As for Buddhism, it even advocates great tolerance, the so-called "Each hair pore can accommodate all worlds without obstruction," which is a metaphor for boundless capacity. We only hope that the authorities on both sides will always think highly of the four hundred million people, and for the sake of the people, first have the great capacity to accept all dissenting opinions, and then calmly discuss them to reconcile all dissenting opinions, so as to obtain the ideal state of holding to the middle path. Only then can true peace be achieved.

Third, there must be "forbearance." "A small lack of forbearance will ruin great plans" is an ancient saying that everyone knows, and the Chinese people have cultivated the virtue of forbearance for thousands of years. General Zhang Zhizhong, the peace advocate, may have the family heirloom of the "Hall of a Hundred Forbearances" and the ancient legacy of suffering humiliation on the bridge. Today, if the authorities on both sides truly have a compassionate heart and implement compassionate policies, then what else is there to say except for everyone to lay down their weapons, hug each other and cry, and repent before the common people? Moreover, in the two parties with twenty years of fighting history, if both sides want to lay down their butcher knives one day, they will of course not be able to stand "mutual abuse leads to no good," and they need to have the great virtue of "enduring humiliation" and accept it calmly without being surprised. Only then can one expect that the propaganda war in the style of罵街 (marching in the streets and loudly shouting to provoke others) can dissipate one day. Since before and after President Chiang Kai-shek's resignation, all these years, until now, he has endured all kinds of abuse, and today he lives a secluded life in the mountains and forests, without officialdom and feeling light, and he never utters a single word of defense against the abuse, which is deeply in line with the key to forbearance. Acting President Li, despite being denigrated as a puppet of American conspiracy, has always been committed to seeking peace, and he is also very good at achieving the samadhi of forbearance. Originally, people have blood and energy, and emotions are impulsive, so forbearance is the most difficult. Therefore, the Buddhist scriptures say, "Those who can practice forbearance can be called powerful adults." It must be known that the greatest obstacle to peace is the emotions of hatred and anger on both sides. If we do not try our best to subdue these emotions, peace will be difficult to achieve. As for the method of treating anger, the Dharma points out the word 定 (settled), and to be settled, one must first be able to forbear. The Diamond Sutra says, "Knowing that all dharmas are without self, one can attain forbearance." The Avatamsaka Sutra says: "Penetrating this door of forbearance, one will achieve unquestionable wisdom." Therefore, if both sides truly want to seek peace, and if they can each restrain themselves and achieve this word of forbearance, then they will surely generate great wisdom "for the country and for the people", and thus transform the success of peace.

Fourth, there must be "compassion." We want to urge the authorities on both sides to look at the pitiful people, to issue great compassion, to take all disputes to the meeting place, and not to use guns and cannons to fight on the battlefield again! The Avatamsaka Sutra says: "... all sentient beings are the roots of trees, and all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are the flowers and fruits; by irrigating sentient beings with the water of great compassion, one can achieve the flowers and fruits of the wisdom of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas... If there are no sentient beings, all Bodhisattvas will ultimately not be able to achieve unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment." This passage can be used to illustrate the relationship between the people and the government authorities. If there are no people, then the government cannot become a government! And the government authorities should issue great compassion to the people, as the Avatamsaka Sutra says, "In all illnesses, be a good physician; for those who have lost their way, show them the right path; in the darkness of night, be a light; for the poor, enable them to find hidden treasures. Bodhisattvas thus equally benefit all sentient beings," then the people will love them and cherish them as parents, and will never resent them and hate them as enemies, or fear them and avoid them as snakes and scorpions. We only hope that the authorities on both sides, especially the Communist authorities, will always think of the deep suffering and trauma suffered by the people from years of war. How can they bear to subject them to the baptism of artillery fire again? Those who "liberate" the people should have the original intention of alleviating the suffering of the people; those who "defend" the people should have the original intention of striving for the survival of the people. These all stem from a thought of compassion for heaven and pity for humanity. If both sides truly issue this great compassion of the Bodhi mind, always thinking of the people and always saving the people, then it will be as the peace elders envisioned, "Although there are many difficulties, there is great hope."

### Cheng Qian's Conversation with a British Newspaper Reporter: Consistent Opinions on Topics Discussed When Acting President Li Passed Through Hunan; It Is Difficult to Judge Whether the CCP Is Sincere About Peace Talks

[Our Changsha Dispatch of the 27th] Trufan, a reporter for the London Observer, arrived in Changsha from Guangzhou. On the 27th, he interviewed Chairman Cheng and raised many questions, to which Cheng answered one by one.

Question: Can you reveal the content of the talks between Acting President Li and the Chairman when he visited Hunan? Were your opinions consistent?

Answer: Acting President Li and I mainly discussed issues related to peace and the need to strengthen the government's own reforms. Our opinions were completely the same. However, there is a lot of content that is not yet the time to disclose, so I am unable to tell you.

Question: Is the CCP sincere about peace talks?

Answer: It is difficult to judge the CCP's sincerity about peace talks at this time. I believe that the CCP may be sincere, but its sincerity is different from ours. That is to say, if the CCP wants everything to meet its requirements, otherwise it may be difficult to be sincere.

Question: If the CCP is not sincere about peace, will the provinces in South China, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, etc., form another government to confront the CCP government in North China?

Answer: This situation is unlikely to happen before. Even if peace fails, the people of the South still hope for peace. Acting President Li will absolutely comply with the people's urgent desire for peace. As long as it is conducive to promoting peace, the government is still willing to make concessions. If the CCP's purpose is something else, and peace cannot succeed, then Acting President Li may make other arrangements on behalf of the people of the South, but it is not yet possible to say for sure.

Question: What is the current situation of the land reform movement in Hunan? What are your future ambitions for this?

Answer: Rent reduction has been implemented in this province. However, due to some shortcomings in technology, it has not been as ideal as expected. I am determined to complete it thoroughly within this year. As for land limitation, it is currently being carefully planned. However, I adopt a moderate approach to land reform, similar to the method of British Fabian socialism, and absolutely not through means such as liquidation, struggle, and slaughter.

Question: It is rumored that President Chiang Kai-shek may resume his post in Guangzhou and continue to lead the government. What are the Chairman's thoughts on this?

Answer: I have no opinion on this issue. However, based on my personal view of general public opinion, this rumor may be the unanimous hope of people who want President Chiang Kai-shek to resume his post. However, progressive elements within the Kuomintang and the people of the whole country unanimously need peace. If President Chiang Kai-shek resumes his post, it is tantamount to symbolizing the despair of peace and continuing the final struggle with the CCP. This will be resolutely opposed by the people of the whole country.

Question: What is the working relationship between the Chairman and Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan?

Answer: Since the formation of the Sun Cabinet, the Hunan Provincial Government has rarely received his official documents or instructions, but the official documents submitted by the Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan are very numerous, but no reply has been received so far.

Trufan came to China from England for only two months. After finishing his work in Changsha, he is scheduled to travel to Nanchang via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway on the morning of the 28th and then return to Shanghai via Hangzhou.

### The United States Asks the Soviet Union for Assistance to the Shenyang Consulate; the Soviet Foreign Ministry Says It Is Powerless to Help

[Associated Press, Moscow, 27th] Since the CCP army occupied Shenyang on November 18 of last year, the U.S. Consul General in Shenyang, Walter, and ten staff members have been cut off from communication with the State Department in Washington. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has repeatedly requested assistance from the Soviet Foreign Ministry, but the Soviet Foreign Ministry has replied that it is powerless to help. According to a report from the Soviet Ministry of Communications, there are no telephone or telegraph connections between the Soviet Union and Shenyang. Although the letters requested by the U.S. Embassy to be forwarded have been received, no reply from Walter has been received so far, so it is impossible to know whether they were delayed. The U.S. Embassy is continuing to inquire.

### The Communist Army in Beiping Receives Flour, Arguing That It Has Nothing to Do with Economic Cooperation

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the CCP broadcast on the 27th, "On the 18th of this month, the Beiping Military Control Commission received 6,666 bags of flour stored in the Beiping Office of the National Government Executive Yuan United Aid Use Committee. Davis, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration Beiping Office, protested to Ye Jianying. However, according to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, the batch of flour belongs to the US Aid Association and was personally handed over by the director of the Beiping Office of the Association. This is the People's Liberation Army receiving the materials of the Kuomintang government and has nothing to do with the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration."

The weight is 7 mace and 2 candareens according to the treasury scale, and the silver content is 88.10%. However, because a large embossing machine cannot be found, after the official start of production, small manual machines will be used for minting, and the output will be limited.

### Public School Employees in Wuhan Send a Telegram, Requesting to Be Paid in Silver Dollars; Military and Political Personnel in the Northwest Will Be Paid in Silver Dollars Starting Next Month

The original telegram reads as follows: "To the public school employees of agencies at all levels in all provinces and cities: I recently sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, which read: 'I have checked that the suffering of our public school employees has been felt deeply since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. The pain has been deepened in the three years of war, especially with the recent increasing fluctuations in prices, which has put us in a desperate situation that we cannot maintain. Although the treatment has been adjusted many times, it is very different from the actual situation. The small amount is of no help. I respectfully present several urgent requests, asking for your approval to relieve the poverty: (1) Civil servants' treatment is poor, please follow the salary method of military personnel, all calculated in silver dollars. (2) Please allocate supplies in kind according to the allocation method of the Beijing-Shanghai area to show fairness. (3) During the transition period, please adjust the treatment from February according to the actual cost of living index in various places to seek reasonableness. (4) Please order the Bank of China to pay in advance before the payment notice from the Ministry of Finance arrives to avoid the lack of food and being affected by price fluctuations. (5) Please change the rice allowance to in-kind distribution or pay it according to the then-market price in various places to conform to the actual benefits. The above requests are only to maintain the minimum of life, and I am desperately pleading, and I beg you to listen again, life is like a thread, and I am waiting for the return.'" I hope that everyone will unanimously appeal in order to change the treatment and maintain survival.

### Recent Situation in the Jianghuai and Southern Shandong Regions: People's Lives Have Not Changed Drastically

Very Little Construction, Wounds of War Not Healed

[Huaming Agency, Shanghai] It has been confirmed by recent arrivals that the living conditions of the people in the Jianghuai region and the border area of southern Shandong, which were occupied by the Communist army some time ago, have not changed drastically. According to their descriptions of the recent situation in the area: due to the relatively warm weather last winter, there was no flooding near Xuzhou. Currently, there is no shortage of rain, and wild vegetables are growing, so for the next few months, people can barely fill their stomachs. However, there is a lack of seeds for planting, so the phenomenon of near-famine has become widespread. Due to limited funds, there is very little construction, so the old traces of war still remain, and most public buildings have not been repaired and are badly damaged. Of the five bridge openings of the Huaihe Railway Bridge in Bengbu, it is heard that they were deliberately destroyed by the retreating Nationalist army. It is said that only a small number of the administrative personnel dispatched by the Communist Party in the area have received a complete education or are experienced. Many young people have been compiled and sent to several "training schools" of the Communist Party to accelerate their learning of courses related to administrative or propaganda work. In one city newly occupied by the Communist army, as many as 400 teachers are presiding over this one-month crash course for the masses. Although ordinary schools have all reopened, whether private or not, they are all staging propaganda plays and participating in mass rallies of the Communist Party. In these rallies, people are often instilled with the idea of living a hard and combative life, and all propaganda is based on anti-American materials. In general, larger cities are able to print and distribute Communist literary and art publications, of which the "Jianghuai Daily" is one. The newspaper uses pinyin letters (i.e., the so-called "Latinization of the Australian Character"); the Communist Party believes that this is a new and valuable direction for the Chinese journalism community. The Communist army units in urban areas have relatively good discipline, while those stationed in rural towns often use civilian goods and do not pay for them. The paper money circulating in the area controlled by the Communist army is very chaotic. Normal postal services have not yet been established in the area.

### Government to Relax Restrictions on Chinese Merchants Doing Business in Japan Can Engage in Semi-Permanent Trade

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] It is reported that our government may soon allow merchants coming to Japan to engage in commercial activities in Japan on a semi-permanent basis. Our delegation in Japan has suggested to the government that merchants be given the same status as overseas Chinese merchants. Our government previously ordered merchants coming to Japan to return home within two months, but most merchants are unwilling to return immediately because they have laid a business foundation and established institutions to engage in Sino-Japanese trade during their stay in Japan. People from the trade group of the delegation said that the Allied Headquarters had already permitted foreign merchants to engage in trade in Japan on a semi-permanent basis several months ago. However, the government's regulations restricting the period of stay for merchants have not changed. Currently, there are 15 Chinese merchants in Japan who, in the six months since arriving in Japan, have exported goods worth US$2.5 million to our country.

### Fierce Artillery Battles Between Army and Navy, Coup d'État Suddenly Occurs in Siam, All External Transportation in Bangkok Interrupted, Siam Report Points Out that Insurgents Received Economic Aid from a Certain Country

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: Bangkok Report: Near the residence of Siamese Prime Minister Songgram, troops from the armored division controlled by the army suddenly engaged in fierce fighting with artillery controlled by the navy today, which only subsided at noon. At the time, the army's radio station broadcast that the troops under Marshal Songgram had pardoned "the rebellion of reactionary elements," while the navy radio station said that the army intended to "obstruct the navy from carrying out its duties, and a tragic war has occurred." The police have now occupied the post office, and all external radio communications and air transportation in Bangkok have been suspended. It is reported that the Siamese authorities announced martial law starting last Thursday. The next day, Songgram declared that the authorities had discovered a coup d'état plot to subvert the government and had taken action to pardon them all. The authorities also announced that they had arrested 24 suspects on Thursday and Friday, including three Siamese military officers and one Chinese. It was said that the suspect was a Communist. The Siam Report also said that these conspirators had received economic assistance from a certain foreign country. However, 48 hours after this announcement, someone suddenly broke into the radio station and broadcast that former Siamese Ambassador to England, Jie Yana, had succeeded Songgram as Prime Minister. 接氏係 is an important member of the "Free Thailand Movement." But the broadcast suddenly stopped, and when the broadcast resumed, it was said that Songgram was still the Prime Minister, and the previous broadcast was done by illegal elements. After the artillery battles occurred today, people were extremely uneasy.

[United Press, Bangkok, 26th] Cabinet sources said on the 26th that there was an organized plan to assassinate key government officials, including Lieutenant General Aetshaldu. He is a member of the Regency Council, and he has now been given a bodyguard. Police sources told United Press that this was a Communist conspiracy to create chaos. He said they were bribing army officers. According to a spokesman for the security forces, 20 Chinese, three army officers, and one non-Communist have been arrested in the search. The officers included a retired Colonel Duan and former Deputy Minister of National Defense Pu Leidi. The government said that the Chinese were accused of secret society activities, and the army officers were accused of illegally concealing weapons. At the same time, it was reported that 68 members of parliament visited Prime Minister Songgram regarding the formation of a new party, which will be named the Democratic Party.

### Burmese Rebels Attack Mandalay, Fighting is Underway in the Southern Suburbs, Military Aid to Burma Conference Opens Today in New Delhi

[Central News Agency, Yangon, 26th] A report has been received here confirming that government troops have recaptured Miyo, the army training center 40 miles north of Mandalay. Officials in Yangon can breathe a little easier, but the war is still going on in the suburbs. The Karen army, which is active in the Meitila area, attacked Mandalay from the south yesterday and entered an area 10 miles from the city but was eventually repelled by government forces. Fierce fighting continues in the southern suburbs of Mandalay. Observers believe that the Karen people will not let go of Mandalay, as it is the second largest city in Burma. In the Insein area, 10 miles outside Yangon, the fighting between the Karen army and the government army has lasted for 27 days. Although the Karen army is surrounded on all sides, they show no signs of surrendering. It is believed that it will take some time to clear the Karen army from the area.

[United Press, New Delhi, 26th] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that India intends to provide loans to Burma to help it overcome the difficulties of the civil war but does not intend to provide military assistance. India and other dominions of the British Commonwealth will meet on the 28th to discuss aid to Burma.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The British Economist Weekly commented on the Burmese situation, saying that the Karen rebellion has further increased the complex situation in Burma, hindering the country from achieving political and economic stability. The hostility between the Burmese and the two million Karen people has a long history. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of the current war. The Burmese government has so far attempted to defend the capital and is receiving military supplies from the United Kingdom in order to maintain its authority. The Burmese government can only quell the rebellion of the Communist People's Volunteer Army if it reaches a compromise with the Karen people. Currently, the Communist Party and the Karen people seem to be fighting side by side. Various parties in Burma may unite to fight against the government, but if the Communist Party can take advantage of the conflict between the two ethnic groups and reap the benefits, the result will be extremely unfortunate for Burma.

### Western Europe Jointly Defends Against Aggression Maintains Military Strength of 3 Million Eisenhower Expected to Be Supreme Planner

[United Press, London, 26th] It has been learned that after the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, a US military general, possibly General Eisenhower, will assume the highest military position in planning the defense of the Atlantic and Western Europe. Western Europe hopes for this development, and most Western nations are willing to do so. At the same time, many US officials believe that after the US signs the treaty and begins to transport arms to Western Europe, this will be the only logical solution. Eisenhower is the most popular figure to be called to serve as commander-in-chief or chairman. His recall to Washington to temporarily serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff while discussing arms aid to Western European countries has further fueled this speculation. The North Atlantic Treaty will unite Western nations to maintain a military strength of more than 3 million people in peacetime and adopt joint defense to be able to cope with any sudden attack from the East. The five Western European countries have already established a joint military committee to formulate preliminary plans for joint defense. Their total military strength reaches 1,567,000 people, and it is also said that they are planning to establish a joint mechanized force of 50 divisions, approximately 500,000 people. After the signing of the treaty, the United States and Canada will participate in the Western European group with military strengths of 1,665,300 and 39,000 people respectively, in the largest peacetime alliance in history.

British Field Marshal Montgomery, the current chairman of the military committee planning the defense of the Western European Union, has his headquarters in Fontainebleau, France. But it has now been decided that after the Western European Union is expanded into the Atlantic Treaty, a US general will serve as the highest military officer, and Montgomery will undoubtedly retire.

Western European and US military experts have pointed out the reasons why a US general will be the logical choice for the highest military officer in the Atlantic Treaty as follows:

(1) The United States will supply arms for Western European defense; (2) The United States will maintain control over any affairs in the Air Force Strategic Command; (3) Only a US general can avoid seeking more arms for his own country.

It is understood that the general outline of the highly secret Western European Union defense plan formulated in Fontainebleau is: a defense line from the coast of the Netherlands to the border of Switzerland, under unified command. Mechanized troops will be supplied by the five countries for defense. According to unofficial reports, France will contribute 35 mechanized divisions and 5 armored divisions to the armored force, while Belgium and the Netherlands will each allocate 3 divisions, plus some small forces, each including approximately 12 combat cavalry squadrons.

### Churchill Gives Speech in Belgium Communist Party Takes the Opportunity to Make Trouble Distributes Leaflets Calling Him a Nazi

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: Brussels Report: Churchill gave a speech on the steps of the Brussels Stock Exchange today, saying that half of Europe today is already in prison, and the other half should quickly take precautions. When Churchill spoke, partly in French, the audience cheered. However, at that time, many lurking members of the Communist Party suddenly shouted the slogan "Down with Churchill" and distributed a large number of leaflets calling Churchill a "Nazi." The leaflets flew in the air and even landed at Churchill's feet. The Belgian authorities have mobilized a large number of armed police, concentrated on the ground floor of the stock exchange, in case of emergency.

[United Press, Brussels, 26th] Churchill said on the 26th that European unification is the only path to maintaining peace on the continent. As the former British Prime Minister called for unification while addressing a conference participating in the European unification movement, the audience cheered thousands of times. Churchill declared: "Let us use our unlimited strength to develop a living organization that is strong enough to give the broad masses of people the opportunity to build their homes and live free and glorious lives."

### Soviet Union Attempts to Undermine Atlantic Alliance

Pressuring Small Countries to Prevent Them from Participating

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Communist Eastern Europe is pressuring small countries not to participate in this convention and to leave the sphere of influence of the signatory countries. Poland summoned its ambassadors to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden this week to discuss the Atlantic Treaty. Its main purpose is obviously to prevent non-Communist countries from considering participating in this convention. Despite this, the signatory countries say they still hope to have Italy and Portugal participate. Norway is expected to accept a formal invitation to participate in the convention negotiations after the parliamentary debate, which will begin on March 1. Officials believe that the Soviet Union is trying to intimidate various countries and says that in the event of a conflict between East and West, France and Italy will stand with the Soviet Union.

### Anniversary of the Czech Communist Party's Rule

[United Press International, Prague, 26th] Thousands of armed workers marched through Wenceslas Square today to celebrate the first anniversary of the Communist coup. Meanwhile, in a nearby pharmacy, three people were on stretchers, covered in blood. The cause of their injuries was not explained.

The Foreign Office expressed concern about the Netherlands' delay in their detention, despite the Security Council's recommendations, and this was one of the reasons why the British Ambassador to the Netherlands, Sir Nevile Bland, issued a note to the Dutch government earlier this month. Well-informed sources believe that the new Dutch policy should help restore political, economic, and social stability in Indonesia, and also help restore confidence in Western countries.

### Treasure Hunters Discover "Gold of Lima"

Pirate Loot Worth US$500 Million

[United Press International, Los Angeles, 26th] Treasure hunters announced today that they have discovered the location of the pirate loot, the "Gold of Lima," mentioned in historical records. This loot is valued at US$500 million and is believed to be buried on the coast of Cocos Island, near the west coast of Costa Rica. Searcher Patterson returned here today after his 444th expedition to the island. It is claimed that his partner, Forbes IV, has used a metal detector to find buried gold on the beach. Fragments of old sails were also found on the island. Forbes IV possesses a secret map passed down from his great-grandfather, Forbes I, who was an educated pirate. According to Spanish archives, the treasure includes pure gold statues and other Spanish conquest memorabilia. It was supposedly transported to Cocos Island by the British merchant ship "Mary" to prevent it from being seized by the South American liberator Bolívar, who was leading his army towards Lima, the capital of Peru, at the time.

### Clay Announces US Decision to Continue Aiding Japan's Reconstruction Before Resigning, Unified Government to Be Established in West Germany Within Months

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] Outgoing Undersecretary of the Army Lieutenant General Lucius D. Clay stated in his final exclusive interview with United Press International reporters on the 26th that he believes a unified government will be established in West Germany "within the next few months". At the same time, the United States will continue to promote Japan's economic reconstruction. Clay said that the merger of the three Western occupation zones of Germany will give the German people the responsibility they need to promote economic progress. He said that it is generally agreed that "Japan's economic reconstruction is the primary goal of the United States government. As far as I know, no one seems to have taken the opposite view. This reconstruction benefits Japan, American taxpayers, and the world. The best evidence that the United States is eager to help Japan recover is that the United States spends $2.5 billion annually on relief and reconstruction." He said that in the past year, Germany's reconstruction has contributed significantly to the success of the European Recovery Program and the Economic Cooperation Administration. He also pointed out that the Berlin airlift has "proven our determination to remain in Berlin and persevere to the end."

### Although the Situation in Europe is Extremely Tense, International War Can Be Avoided for the Time Being: A General Review of East-West Relations in 1948

— Sabengeng

(I)

This is not intended to describe the internal situation of various countries in continental Europe over the past year, but to review the international situation in continental Europe over the past year.

The situation in continental Europe in 1948 can almost be said to have been a year of "Cold War". The confrontation between the East and West blocs became increasingly acute. At the most serious time, it seemed that the "Cold War" was about to turn into a "Hot War". Fortunately, continental Europe has survived another year of peace.

Although the reasons for this East-West confrontation are complex and long-term, from the perspective of the past year, it actually began with the breakdown of the four-power London conference on the German peace treaty at the end of 1947. Although the breakdown of this four-power conference was not the beginning, it did strengthen and accelerate the determination and steps of Britain and the United States to organize the Western European bloc. This determination and these steps, in turn, strengthened and accelerated the Soviet Union's preparations, and the East-West "Cold War" became more and more fierce.

Let's start from the beginning.

Shortly after the breakdown of the four-power conference on Germany, on January 22 last year, British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a very important speech on foreign policy in the British House of Commons. He explained that the policy of four-power cooperation had been interrupted, and that "the free countries of Western Europe must now unite closely." He put forward the policy of a "Western European Alliance", believing that it would be a voluntary combination of various governments to discuss practical economic and military issues, and said that the five countries of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg had already begun discussions. What followed Bevin's speech was, on the one hand, the Czech coup on February 25, and on the other hand, the signing of the five-nation Brussels Treaty by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on March 17. The result of the Czech coup was the strengthening and consolidation of the Communist Party's power in Czechoslovakia. The nature of the five-nation treaty, in a certain sense, is a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union or the Eastern European bloc. According to the provisions of the five-nation treaty, on the one hand, there is economic cooperation among the five countries, and on the other hand, the five countries jointly recognize that if one of the five countries is subjected to military attack in Europe, they must immediately assist each other. At the same time, the five countries also agreed to establish an organization for a permanent liaison conference. However, the role of this five-nation treaty is very limited without the participation of the United States and Canada. Although the historical habit of the United States is not to participate in international groups, there is no precedent for participating in foreign alliance treaties. This time, in June, the Senate passed the so-called Vandenberg Resolution, urging the United States government to participate in international regional security agreements. The bill itself is not a treaty, but it was passed by the Republican Senate, which strengthened the Democratic government's confidence and position in foreign affairs, and made President Truman know that he would not become a second Wilson. (At that time, President Truman certainly could not be sure that by the end of the year he would not only be re-elected president himself, but also have a Democratic Congress. At that time, his foreign policy actually had to be agreed to by the Republicans.) Therefore, in July, the United States, Canada, and the five countries began to discuss how to connect Western Europe and North America, and at the same time sent "observers" to attend the military conferences of the five countries. The so-called "how to connect" is the "North Atlantic Treaty" that is still under negotiation. At the same time, the "Foreign Assistance Act" (that is, the US domestic law that implements the Marshall Plan or the European Recovery Program, which is usually widely heard of) was completed through the US legal procedures and signed by President Truman on April 3. After the establishment of this law, the sixteen European recipient countries immediately gathered in Paris and established the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation". These are not just postures, but concrete measures to deal with Eastern Europe under the leadership of the United States or Britain and the United States.

(II)

The most tense manifestation of the Cold War is not here. The most exciting scene is in Germany, where the East and West blocs meet head-on.

As mentioned above, the German issue had already been declared broken at last year's four-power conference. This breakdown increased some international contradictions last year, and the most direct one, of course, was Germany itself.

As early as February last year, shortly after the breakdown of the four-power conference, Britain, the United States, and France began discussing the issue of their occupation zones in Germany in London. Later, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg joined, and from spring to summer, the six-nation agreement was announced on June 7. This agreement involves the international co-management of the Ruhr, Germany's participation in the European Recovery Program, the merger of the British, American, and French occupation zones in Germany, the establishment of a German federal government, and so on. The most important thing is, on the one hand, to bring in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and on the other hand, to decide to establish a temporary Western German government before German unification (that is, the merger of East and West Germany). In addition, Britain, the United States, and France also announced on June 18 that they would implement currency reform within their occupation zones (excluding parts of Berlin). (implemented on June 20) The Soviet Union's countermeasure was to start banning vehicle traffic between the Soviet occupation zone and the Western occupation zones from June 19. Berlin was divided into four occupation zones, but because the entire Berlin was located within the Soviet occupation zone, banning vehicle traffic between the Soviet occupation zone and the Western occupation zones was tantamount to blockading the external traffic of the British, American, and French occupation zones in Berlin. On June 23, the Soviet Union also announced the declaration of the foreign ministers' meeting of Eastern European countries, accusing the six-nation agreement of dividing Germany.

(III)

The blockade of traffic was, in the Soviet Union's view, a necessary means to deal with the West German currency reform. In fact, the Soviet Union probably also hoped to find a solution to the German issue through this. However, the two sides were not able to reach an agreement immediately. Then, the Soviet Union announced that the currency of East Germany would also be reformed, while West Germany expanded the use of the new West German currency in the Berlin occupation zone, and the Soviet Union's blockade of traffic became more and more severe. In order to maintain the daily life of the Berlin occupation zone, Britain and the United States had to use a large amount of airlift (it is said that the average daily volume was about 4,000 tons). At the same time, the governments of Britain, the United States, and France, considering that this issue could not be solved by the military authorities of the occupation zone, directly negotiated with Moscow. The three countries' representatives met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin, Foreign Minister Molotov, and Stalin in Moscow. On August 30, they reached a principle agreement that the traffic would be opened and that the German currency in the Soviet occupation zone would be the sole currency of Berlin. The specific method of four-power joint management of Berlin's currency was left to the military authorities of the four countries in Berlin to discuss. After reaching an agreement, it would be implemented immediately. However, because the military authorities of the four countries had different interpretations of this agreement, the Soviet military authorities, Sokolovsky, believed that the Soviet Union had the right to manage Berlin's external air traffic. After several discussions, there was no unanimous agreement. On September 26, the governments of Britain, the United States, and France notified the Soviet authorities that they would submit the matter to the United Nations Security Council. The problem that the four countries could not solve was unlikely to have a better solution in the Security Council. (These four countries all have veto power in the Security Council. In other words, if there is no common agreement among these four countries, the motion cannot be passed.) Therefore, although consultations were held again and again, the Security Council's motion failed to pass due to the Soviet Union's veto. Not only that, Berlin has had two municipal governments since November 30. The split deepened, and the stalemate continued. In early December, the draft North Atlantic Treaty was sent by the five countries to Washington to discuss with the United States and Canada. At the same time, the five countries also appointed a committee to discuss ways to strengthen and expand the alliance in Paris. In addition, in continental Europe, the Greek civil war, which has a very strong international meaning, has not stopped, and the Danube issue, the issue of the former Italian colonies, and the issue of the Austrian peace treaty are not known when a practical solution can be found. However, these issues, compared with the Berlin issue, have become not the most serious issues.

Looking at last year and thinking about this year, the situation this year may not be better than last year. The Eastern bloc continues its existing domestic and foreign policies. The Western bloc will strengthen its own organization and use the US dollars under the Marshall Plan to revive the economies of various countries. The confrontation between East and West has probably reached a point where it cannot be more acute. Whether war is likely to break out is probably something that no one dares to make a definite prediction. If we reason according to reason, war is unlikely to occur. There are only two countries in the world that are qualified to talk about war now, and these two qualified countries may not want to fight immediately, and they are geographically so far apart. Several countries within this distance have no way to fight. The Berlin issue illustrates the tension of the situation in continental Europe and the difficulty of coordination between East and West, but it also illustrates that international war will not break out in the short term. If one side wanted to fight, it would have already started. Everyone hopes to win without fighting. War cannot be fought under this kind of situation. This was the situation last year, and it may still be the case this year.

### Framing and Extorting Priests for Tens of Thousands of US Dollars: Police Officers Crack Major Case, Five Chinese and Foreign Criminals Apprehended, Confessing to a Total of Ten Fraud Cases Committed Before and After

[Our Newspaper] Belgian priest Georges Germain, 45 years old, resides at No. 70, Lane 135, Qunshan Road, Xijiao. He is the host of the church. Last autumn, George preached in Pan Yang, Northeast China, disguised as a German named Ke Like. Ke is 25 years old and previously studied law at Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping. He is proficient in Chinese, English, German, and Russian, and is well-versed in Chinese law. Last winter, after the Communist army entered Northeast China, Father George took refuge in Shanghai and presided over a church on Huashan Road. A month ago, George passed through the Bund Yangjingbang and unexpectedly reunited with Ke Like. They shook hands and said hello, and George told him the address of the church. A few days later, Ke visited George at the church on Huashan Road and showed him a draft for US$500, asking George to cash it. George refused because he had no cash. Ke left the draft there and left. Later, he sent several telegrams inquiring about it, but George never cashed it for him. As a result, Ke harbored a grudge. Ke then gathered a stateless rogue named Bibo, a stateless person named Elieze who specialized in making counterfeit gold bars, a White Russian named Ai Gai from No. 3, Lane 159, Wanmaoming South Road, an American named Jimei from No. 41, Xiafei Square, Linsen Middle Road, and a former Soviet manager named Zhao Yongbi to conspire to frame George. Ke asked Wang Xianzhang, a Suzhou native living at No. 60, Lane 7, North Chengdu Road, to buy three catties of apples, which Elieze used to make fake opium paste. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, Ke took it to the church and secretly placed it on the bookshelf in George's bedroom. At around 8:00 PM, Ke colluded with Bibo and Zhao Yongbi and six or seven others, wearing armbands and pretending to be police officers. They handcuffed Ke and drove him to the church, accusing Ke and George of jointly committing the crime of black market gold speculation. After George denied it, Zhao and others searched arbitrarily and found an oval-shaped piece of opium soil, weighing about several taels, on the bookshelf. Then they became fierce and insisted on arresting George and taking him away. George knew that he had been framed, but he could not defend himself. As a result, they were threatened and extorted for US$50,000. George signed a draft for US$30,000 and gave them US$1,530 in cash before they left. Later, because the signature on the US$30,000 draft did not match, it was rejected. Ke sent several telegrams to George demanding it, and George, unable to bear the harassment, reported the case to the Municipal Police Department for arrest.

Police Officers Dispatched to Disguise and Wait

Sun Dafang, Director of the Criminal Division of the Police Department, reported the case to Director Yu, who ordered the Jing'an Temple Police Branch to solve the case within a time limit. Wang Huachen and Yan Xianghu, the chief and deputy chiefs of the branch, ordered Yu Ding, the chief of the Criminal Affairs Section, to conduct a thorough investigation. Chief Yu, considering the seriousness of the case, specially convened a meeting of all criminal police officers and selected capable police officers Ye Zhijiang, Yang Zhenzhong, Lu Tianjiang, Yang Junqing, Huang Jiaqi, Zheng Jiwen, Liang Guangyu, Song Shixiang, Wu Liquan, Jin Yuqi, etc. to form a special team. Inspector Meng Ruisheng supervised each police officer to perform their duties. Chief Yu personally accompanied Inspector Meng to Father George's residence on Huashan Road to investigate the truth and seek clues, and instructed George to pretend to be conciliatory when they called, and to contact the police secretly at any time. After returning to the bureau, Yu and others dispatched a large number of police officers to wait at the criminals' entry and exit points and major hotels. At 2:00 PM on the 15th, Yu Dang Bibo, at the request of Ke Like, called George and asked him to deliver the remaining money near Linsen Middle Road, Changde Road. Chief Yu of the Police Bureau received the news and disguised himself and Inspector Meng and waited at the location. George sent Father (Belgian) Albert Devis to negotiate on his behalf. At the time, a military jeep happened to be parked at the corner of the Empire Cafe, which they suspected, and they did not dare to negotiate. The police officers did not leave until 6:30 PM at dusk.

Another Phone Call Asking for Payment

At about 7:00 PM, George received another phone call from the other party, pointing out that George had reported the case to the police authorities, saying that if the remaining US$30,000 was not handed over, they would definitely take his life. He also said that they would meet near the church at 8:00 PM tonight. George asked for a delay until tomorrow, saying that he had a banquet that night. At 8:00 AM the next morning, another phone call came, asking if the money had been prepared, and again said that the meeting place this time was a mobile location, with people following behind you at any time. They would depart from the residence at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, proceed slowly along Huashan Road, Changle Road, and St. George's Garden Ballroom. If no one came forward to negotiate, they would proceed towards Xiumei Road, as far as Linsen Road. After Father George listened, he again sent Father Ai to report to the police station. After Chief Yu and others studied the terrain and set up a dragnet, the capable officer Lu Changjiang disguised himself as a rickshaw puller and carried Chief Yu's son to school on Changle Road to wait. Sergeant Ye Zhijiang, police officers Huang Jiaqi, Yang Junqing, Xu Jian, etc. disguised themselves as newspaper vendors and hawkers. Other police officers, Jin Yuqi, Zheng Jiwen, carried Chief Yu's two daughters, Hui Yun and Xiao Lian, pretending to be young friends, carrying books and strolling nearby as cover.

White Russian Arrested on Du Mei Road

At about 3:40 PM, an airplane circled in the sky. The disguised police officers pretended to look up at the sky and suddenly saw a White Russian Ai Gai talking to Ai beside Ai on Du Mei Road. Ai then dealt with him perfunctorily, and the White Russian handed over US$1,500. When Ai walked to the intersection of Linsen Middle Road, Chief Yu and Inspector Meng, who were lying in ambush, stepped forward, arrested him, took the original loot together to the bureau. The white russian confessed that he was instructed by Ke. According to the confession of the white russian, the police went to the vicinity of the Cathay Grand Theatre to arrest Ke but failed.

At the same time, the branch listened to Ai Gai's confession and learned that the Western Youth Association had received a blank check, such as the one issued by the account holder Xu Qingguo. The police went to investigate and confirmed that this was the case. After checking with the bank to find out Xu's address, Xu was summoned for questioning. According to Xu, the check had been stolen by someone beforehand, and he suspected that it was done by his cohabitant Wang Xianzhang, because Wang had frequent contact with outsiders. The police arrested Wang, and Wang confessed after an interrogation. He also confessed to conspiring to threaten Father George and other cases.

Five Criminals Confess to Ten Cases

Later, the case-handling police officers waited and searched in major hotels. Two days later, they finally arrested Ke Like, Elieze, and Jimei one after another in rooms 206 and 210 of the Leyi Hotel at No. 2004 Nanjing West Road. The others, such as Bibo, are still at large. They also summoned Locke, an American teenager living in the same room, to the bureau to testify, confessing the process of their conspiracy to commit illegal acts. The criminals finally had nothing to say.

### Mourning the Authority on Physics; Passing Away in a Foreign Land While Receiving Medical Treatment; Academics from Academia Sinica Gather to Hold a Memorial Service for Sa Bentong

[Reported by this newspaper] The late Dr. Sa Bentong, Director-General of Academia Sinica and an authority on physics, passed away in a foreign land while seeking medical treatment in the United States for cancer. Colleagues from Academia Sinica and famous figures from academic and educational circles held a memorial service at 9:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the institute on Yueyang Road. Those present included Zhu Jia骅, Mei Yi-qi, Hu Shi, Wu Youxun, Zhang Yuanji, Zhuang Changgong, Hang Liwu, Du Zuozhou, Ren Hongjun, Zhou Tongqing, Wu Junsheng, Li Bake, Yang Chuoan, Wang Zhizhuo, Shen Xilian, Zhao Zengjue, as well as the directors of various institutes of the Academia Sinica, all colleagues, and relatives and friends of Sa Bentong, totaling several hundred people. A portrait of Sa Bentong was hung on the front of the auditorium, with a eulogy from his family below. On a long table in front were a pair of silver candles and a censer. A vase of fresh flowers and four plates of flowers and three plates of green fruit were offered on the stage. Numerous wreaths were displayed beside the stage, and the four walls were covered with elegiac couplets from various circles. Beside the portrait was an elegiac couplet from Zhu Jia骅, which read: "Grieving that a brief illness has become an eternal farewell, I recall asking about his illness in Zhongshan, waving goodbye in Longhua, and seeking to heal his ailment in a new land. I originally hoped that there would always be a way to return to spring. Remembering three years of mutual support, I deeply admired his unparalleled talent and extraordinary intelligence. I scratch my head and ask the heavens, why do you begrudge me this person?" Wang Shijie and Hang Liwu's elegiac couplet read: "Why did you leave in such a hurry? News from overseas startled us from our dreams. Why doesn't Heaven pity us? The Huangpu River sobs, expressing our sorrow." Ren Hongjun's elegiac couplet read: "Establishing words and deeds, writing books in bed, truly a vigorous person; governing learning and affairs, passing on the flame endlessly, what other is there like him?" The Institute of Physics of Academia Sinica's elegiac couplet read: "Looking at the land, with smoke everywhere, thorns covering the ground, how can academic research be discussed? I wish his spirit would fly across the ocean and return to protect the Jiuhua Mountains. For two years in the Changwu Institute, he exhausted his heart and soul, toiling and complaining, and devoted himself to mathematics and physics but did not complete his work. Knowing that Mr. Sa was ill and using different instruments, he died in bitterness in San Francisco."

### New Transportation Prices on Two Railways to Be Implemented Next Month; Surprise Inspections Strictly Prohibit Ticketless Passengers

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the relocation of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration south by the Executive Yuan, the evacuation of public employees and large-scale telegram transportation have disrupted the traffic order and all original administrative systems. Passenger and freight transportation once nearly came to a complete standstill. Ninety percent of all vehicles were allocated for military and public transportation. During this period, the railway bureau suffered huge losses in revenue. Subsequently, labor strikes occurred one after another, and the result of repeated unrest created an unprecedented economic crisis for the two railways today. In order to solve this crisis, Wang Zhaohuai, the director of the bureau, resolutely decided to automatically adjust passenger and freight prices by four times on the 12th of this month, believing that the problem could be solved, but it was not. Although the transportation prices increased four times, the actual revenue increased by less than two times. According to the spokesman of the bureau, there are two reasons for this: (1) The economic strength of the people is generally low, and railway transportation prices have been far behind general prices in the past ten years. The public has become accustomed to low transportation prices, so passengers will inevitably decrease every time passenger tickets are initially adjusted. (2) As the war approaches the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou areas, the number of troops stationed along the two railways has greatly increased. Ticketless military passengers on trains sometimes exceed ordinary passengers. Moreover, some lawless soldiers are also engaged in running single businesses, smuggling "yellow croakers." Recently, it has been discovered that a small number of railway bureau employees are also participating in this activity. This has a significant impact on the railway bureau's revenue. In view of the first reason mentioned above, the two railways authorities, in accordance with the formulaic adjustment of transportation prices stipulated by the Ministry of Transportation, such as establishing joint inspection teams to conduct surprise inspections at any time in conjunction with the Garrison Headquarters and various military units, strictly prohibit railway bureau employees and soldiers from smuggling "yellow croakers" and various ticketless passengers. Once discovered, they will be severely punished, it is said.

### Zhu Jiahua Delivers a Eulogy Praising Sa's Achievements

The meeting started at 9:00 AM. The funeral music was played, and the ceremony was conducted as scheduled. Chairman Zhu Jiahua presented a wreath, and the Academia Sinica, the Alumni Association of Xiamen University, and the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association paid their respects in succession and read the eulogy. Then, Zhu delivered a eulogy, recalling Sa's experience as the Director-General of Academia Sinica, praising Sa's efforts to develop the work of the institute and his achievements in establishing the Center for Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry in Nanjing under difficult conditions, and reporting on Sa's situation in seeking medical treatment in the United States. He also stated: "Mr. Sa's contribution to science is very great. His death is a great loss to the future of science and to the country. Last week, the institute held an administrative meeting and decided to rename the Physics Laboratory of the newly built Center for Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry as the Bentong Hall. In addition, we want to establish a Bentong Scholarship as a memorial after the currency system is stabilized. Mr. Sa's will is to send his ashes to Tsinghua University, Xiamen University, or Academia Sinica. If everyone wants it, then divide it into three parts. I don't think it is appropriate to separate the ashes, so I want to ask Tsinghua and Xiamen University first. If they are willing to give up, then Academia Sinica will accept it. I am very sad when I bring up these things. We should follow Mr. Sa's tenacious and outstanding spirit to engage in work. This is the best way for us to commemorate Mr. Sa."

### Wu Youxun Reports on Sa's Life and Deeds While Shedding Tears

Then, Wu Youxun, the former president of National Central University, reported on Sa's life and deeds, stating briefly: Sa was born in Minhou, Fujian in July 1902. In 1921, he graduated from Tsinghua School and was sent to the United States, entering Stanford University to study mechanical engineering. In 1924, he obtained a bachelor's degree and transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The following year, he obtained a degree in electrical engineering and transferred to study physics. Two years later, he obtained a doctorate in physics. In 1927, he left school and was hired by Westinghouse Electric Company as an engineer. In 1928, he returned to China and was hired by Tsinghua University as a professor in the Department of Physics for as long as eight years. In 1936, he went to the United States again and was hired by Ohio State University as a visiting professor. He returned to China a year later, and on the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was hired as the president of Xiamen University for seven years. In 1944, he went to the United States again, serving as a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University. In 1945, he returned to China and served as the Director-General of Academia Sinica until the day of his death. He has written extensively, especially his physics textbooks, which are famous at home and abroad. Wu and Sa were old friends for twenty years, and he was unable to speak without tears during the report. Finally, he stated: "Today, we mourn him and deeply and forever remember his learning, morality, and writings."

Then, Mei Yi-qi, the president of Tsinghua University, gave a speech stating: "Bentong's death when he was very accomplished in his career and learning is a great loss and very regrettable. But upon closer reflection, we don't have to be too sad. Everyone has to die once. In addition to illness, there are many reasons why a person cannot continue to work. Bentong's death from illness is because he was too serious about his work. He was very young. When he was studying at Tsinghua, I could see from his playing tennis and being a Boy Scout that he was very serious and very fair in everything he did. He is worthy of the word 'Integrity' in English. We should use him as an example."

### Hu Shi Praises Sa's Four Careers in His Speech

Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, said in his speech: "Mr. Sa's career has four aspects, namely Tsinghua University, Xiamen University, Academia Sinica, and his writings. His teaching method is very good. He taught physics at Peking University for a year. Because he taught so well, his successor was not welcomed by the students after he left. He ran Xiamen University, which was the best university in the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He was too responsible for running Academia Sinica, which delayed his illness. The textbooks he wrote are also very successful. His twenty-year career has invisibly influenced countless people, so I agree with President Mei's point of view. I think that although Mr. Sa has passed away, his spirit is immortal."

Then, Du Zuozhou, the former president of Yingshi University, gave a speech, expressing his admiration for the spirit of running the school when Lian was in charge of Xiamen University. Finally, the family representative gave a thank-you speech, the funeral music was played, and the ceremony was completed. The memorial service for this perfect figure in the academic world ended in a sea of sorrow.

### Students from Seven National Universities in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing Petition the Acting President, Asking for a Solution to the Crisis and Making Four Demands

[Reported by this newspaper] The presidents of various national universities and colleges in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou joined forces last night to go to Nanjing and request the central government to improve the treatment of faculty and staff, increase funding, and issue contingency funds. Yesterday, Fudan students held a meeting to bid farewell to their school's president, Zhang Yi, who went to Nanjing. The student organizations of seven national universities in Shanghai, namely Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Tongji University, Jinan University, the Conservatory of Music, Tangshan Institute of Technology, and the Vocational School for Teachers of Early Childhood Education, jointly petitioned Acting President Li, which President Zhang took to Nanjing to submit. The contents roughly stated: "Under the circumstances of constantly rising prices, the salaries of professors are only worth three silver dollars. The school's operating expenses are not enough to pay for one month's water and electricity bills. Staff cannot support their families, and workers and police can barely drink porridge. As for our students, the average food allowance for students enjoying public funding cannot even buy half a fried dough stick a day, and they simply cannot get enough to eat. And today, there are still many self-funded students who cannot even afford the meals needed to maintain this standard of living and can only go to school with empty stomachs every day. This shows that not only is education on the verge of bankruptcy, but it is also pushing the survival of teachers, students, staff, and police to the brink of desperation. Our demands are: (1) Increase the treatment of professors, staff, workers, and police and the amount of public funding, and adjust it every half month according to the Shanghai Municipal Employee Price Index. (2) Increase the school's operating expenses and issue them early. (3) Immediately issue sufficient contingency funds for three months of expenses and living expenses for all teachers, students, staff, and police in all schools. (4) All students should be treated as publicly funded."

### The Shanghai Student Union's Propaganda Appeals to Students with Ten Points

[Reported by this newspaper] The "Shanghai Student Union," led by the Chinese Communist Party, yesterday mimeographed and distributed two types of propaganda, one being the "Shanghai Student Union's Declaration on Striving for Democratic Survival Rights and Maintaining the Education Cause," and the other being the "Declaration Supporting the CCP's Eight Conditions, Striving for True Peace, and Responding to the Call of the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference," and attached a misprinted "Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference's Letter to Shanghai Citizens on the Current Situation," in which the peace movement advocated by Acting President Li was severely criticized. In its declaration on maintaining the education cause, it appealed to the educational circles and students of this city with the following points: (1) Demand that the reactionary government release all arrested students; (2) Allow expelled patriotic students to return to school to attend classes; (3) Automatically resume publication of banned student publications; (4) Demand school funding from the reactionary government; (5) Demand contingency funds from the reactionary government; (6) Demand a unified bonus from the reactionary government; (7) Demand the school's association from the reactionary government; (8) Promote anti-war and disintegrate the garrison among soldiers; (9) Prevent bureaucratic capital from fleeing south; (10) Return the people's fat to the people. In its declaration on supporting the CCP's eight conditions, it specifically pointed out that the government is concentrating its efforts on two aspects. First: "Making every effort to preserve the power of the reactionary clique, so that it can safely get through the current revolutionary storm sweeping the country, in order to seize the opportunity at the appropriate time to make a comeback, hoping to get three months of respite, reorganizing and newly forming dozens of divisions for combat." Second aspect: "Distorting the content of the eight peace conditions, turning it from true peace into false peace," and "Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren are thus dividing the work: Chiang is in charge of the first task, and Li is in charge of the second task." It also stated: "Although some people deliberately exaggerate the contradictions between Chiang and Li in order to make people have illusions about Li and think he is very good, they are consistent in their anti-people and counter-revolutionary stance, and also because they are at the behest of the same master—American imperialism, their act has always been well-matched." In the declaration, Liang Shuming, who had been silent for a long time in retirement, recently wrote an article calling for peace, which was denounced as "helping the reactionaries carry out conspiracies to preserve their strength." At the same time, it pointed out that "Liu Bugu, Wan Meizi, and L Mang's public activities" are "the government's attempt to sow reactionary seeds on the land after the victory of the people's revolution." Finally, it called on the students of this city to use their own strength to liberate Shanghai.

### Gunshots at the Jue Lu Hotel; A Young Traveler Injured; The Police Station Sends Personnel to Arrest Two People

### A Fake Doctor Treats Illnesses and Collects Money; Exposed and Detained by the Police Station for Investigation

[Reported by this newspaper] Fu Keming, a 20-year-old employee of the Li Da Xiang Cotton Cloth Shop at 399 Jiangsu Road, was receiving customers in the shop at around 4:00 PM on the 26th when two men suddenly came, pretending to be doctors, treating people for illnesses for free and not taking any money. They also promoted it to their colleagues, saying that Fu had lung disease and could be treated. After being led upstairs, they placed a Chinese medicine inside Fu's navel, with a copper object on top, shaped like a teacup, connected to a leather tube, with an inflator connected to the end of the tube. After inflating it several times, something was sucked out of the belly, resembling a gelatinous substance. The person removed the copper instrument and said that there was a disease in the abdomen, which has now been sucked out and can be improved, but instructed that a kind of pill must be swallowed, and that the pill must be purchased from a foreign pharmacy, otherwise it can be purchased from them for three silver dollars per pill, a total of nine silver dollars for three pills. Later, colleagues discovered it and knew that it was a pretext to swindle money, so they called the police and took them to the police station for interrogation. According to their confession, one is Liu Changtong, a 37-year-old from Henan, and the other is Zeng Fangjun, a 40-year-old from Wuhu. In fact, they were wandering in a foreign land and lacking means to make a living, so they came up with this inferior plan.

### First Round Basketball League Finals: Hua Lian Veterans Achieve Seven Wins in Seven Games; Shanghai Police Force Fights Hard but Ultimately Loses; Green Team Also Maintains a Flawless Record with Four Wins in Four Games

[Report from our newspaper] In the finals of the first round of the A Division Women's basketball league, both Hua Lian and the Green Team emerged victorious without any unexpected upsets. Hua Lian achieved seven wins in seven games in the A Division First Group, while the Green Team secured four wins in four games in the Women's Division, both maintaining flawless records. Despite a valiant effort, the Shanghai Police Force ultimately succumbed to the more experienced Hua Lian team with a score of 51 to 42, the halftime score being 23 to 13. The Shanghai Police Force appeared flustered at the start, falling behind by a dozen points, allowing Hua Lian to take the lead and maintain it throughout the game, ultimately winning by nine points. Hua Lian's veterans' steadiness was the main reason for their victory, while the Shanghai Police Force's all-out effort and meticulousness were also commendable. In the Women's Division, Xinghua's absence due to forfeit resulted in a walkover victory for the Line Team. In the A Division Second Group D, the Red Cavalry team defeated the Shantou team by a score of 38 to 37 in overtime, winning by one point. The gymnasium was packed to capacity last night, with over three thousand spectators, creating an exceptionally enthusiastic atmosphere.

The A Division match began with Hua Lian's Liang Xiong scoring one point from a free throw, opening the scoring. Song Yuan, Jin Sheng, and Liang Xiong then successively made three baskets, putting Hua Lian ahead 7-0, surprising the Shanghai Police Force. Zhen Zhong scored one point, and Cheng Zhang made one free throw, but the Shanghai Police Force showed no improvement. Five minutes later, the Shanghai Police Force's He Zeng scored their first basket, and He Jingui added another point for the Shanghai Police Force. Jin Yan then dribbled and shot, bringing the score to 13-3. He Zeng made two free throws, Song Yuan made one basket, and Jiu Quan scored, bringing the score to 15-7. At halftime, Hua Lian led 23-13.

Resuming play, the Shanghai Police Force's He Zeng made a free throw, and Bo Wen scored the first basket, suggesting a potential comeback, bringing the score to 24-19, with the gap narrowing. Da Li made two baskets, and Lao Bao made one, making it 30-19. From then on, Hua Lian maintained a ten-point lead. At 40-32, Zhen Zhong committed his fifth foul and left the court. At 46-36, Zhang Liangxiong also committed his fifth foul, and team captain Ren Xiangcheng personally stepped up. In the end, the Shanghai Police Force's Jin Gui and Xiong Biao replaced Jiu Quan and Qi Xia, attempting a desperate gamble.

She recently suffered from hypertension and sought treatment from Dr. Li Ming (42 years old, from Wuxi) at No. 25, Lane 672, Extended Le Road. After two months of treatment, she no longer needed medication. As a result, Zhang and Li developed feelings for each other, but recently their relationship suddenly cooled. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, Zhang went to Li's clinic to demand the return of personal letters she had sent to Li. The two got into a conflict, which led to a mutual assault. Neighbors Shu Hongfang, Zhao Chenying, and Yang Yueying tried to mediate but were unsuccessful, and they were taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, where mediation is currently underway. It is reported that Zhang Xueqin was once engaged to Zhang Tianzhong, the former Deputy Chief of the Zhabei Branch.

### Casual Chat about Yandang Tea

— Wang Liao

Yandang Mountain is located in the eastern countryside of Yueqing. The scenery is majestic, and the rocks are extraordinary. Peaks like Tianzhu Peak rise abruptly from the ground, standing tall in the clouds, inspiring awe. Waterfalls cascade from great heights, resembling white silk ribbons. Jiang Tao Shu of the Qing Dynasty famously wrote, "It's hard to capture the waterfalls in writing, a life un-Yandang-ed is a wasted life," which vividly depicts the beauty of Yandang's scenery. Every year, countless visitors come to Yandang in the spring and autumn, drawn by its reputation.

The Naming of Tea! (II)

[Report from Yueqing, 14th] Yandang Mountain boasts numerous specialties. Besides dried pomfret and various medicinal herbs, Yunwu Tea (Cloud and Mist Tea) is also well-known. Yandang Mountain's tea leaves, produced in areas like Longqiu Bei and Doushuai Dong, are referred to as "Yunwu Tea," similar to those produced in Wuyi Mountain in Fujian Province and Tiantai Mountain in this province. Tea trees thrive in temperate climates and prefer humidity. They grow exceptionally well in areas with mist and less sunlight. Therefore, tea leaves from high mountains and deep valleys, blessed by the mist and a favorable environment, are of particularly high quality. This is how Yunwu Tea gets its name!

Yandang Mountain's Yunwu Tea is considered the best when produced in Doushuai Dong, followed by Longqiu Bei, then Da Longqiu, and finally Lingyan Temple Beidou Dong area, which is considered the lowest grade. In terms of the natural environment, Doushuai Dong has the highest altitude. Its rocky peaks overlap, reaching the sky. The duration of sunlight is short, only from 10 AM to 4 PM. From February to November, the area is shrouded in mist, creating a gloomy atmosphere. Even in summer, it is not hot but rather cool. However, the winter climate is clearer. The natural environment of Longqiu Bei is also excellent, similar to Doushuai Dong, but its altitude is slightly lower. Da Longqiu is located at the foot of Longqiu Bei, making it slightly inferior. In addition, Lingyan Temple Beidou Dong and other areas are located on plains, making them far less suitable. In terms of tea quality, Doushuai Dong tea contains more theine and tannin. It can be steeped multiple times in boiling water, and the final brew still tastes fragrant. (Water content is about 31%, theine about 2%, tannin about 16%, ash about 5%, and soluble matter about 34%). Longqiu Bei tea can be steeped twice. As for the tea produced in Da Longqiu and Lingyan Temple Beidou Dong, it is merely ordinary tea.

Miraculous Tea for Healing

Tea is made from the tender leaves of tea trees and acts as a stimulant, capable of relieving physical and mental fatigue. The tea leaves produced in Doushuai Dong have a unique and miraculous effect in treating chest and headache pain. A neighbor of mine, over 40 years old, suffered from chest and headache pain. Western and Chinese medicine were ineffective, and the pain was unbearable. He was unable to work, and his career was ruined by this illness. This summer, he met a Daoist from Doushuai Dong, who gave him half a catty of Doushuai Dong tea leaves. He drank it three times a day, and this long-standing illness miraculously disappeared. Although there is no scientific explanation, the clinical experience is extremely effective, further convincing me of the value of Doushuai Dong tea leaves.

Around Grain Rain

The harvest season for Yunwu Tea is usually around Grain Rain (a solar term). At this time, the new tea buds have opened into four leaves. The tip and the top three leaves are picked, leaving one leaf behind. Sometimes, when the new buds have opened into five leaves, the top three leaves are picked. Tender leaves can be picked three times. The first batch of buds is of excellent quality, making high-grade tea. The yield is small. The third batch of buds yields six times more than the first batch, but the quality of the tea is much lower. After the tea leaves are picked on a clear day, they are sorted according to quality, and coarse debris is removed. They are processed immediately. Tea picked in the afternoon must be processed completely at night. If processing is delayed, methods must be found to store the leaves to prevent wilting and fermentation. The villagers do not have large-scale factories and lack scientific knowledge, so they adhere to traditional methods of tea production, which involves steaming, kneading, drying, and selecting. Eight catties of fresh leaves from the roasting stove can produce two catties of dried tea. After the tea is made, it must be kept dry and protected from moisture. Tin containers are preferred for storage. If not stored properly, the aroma will dissipate, microorganisms will invade, and the fragrance will weaken, making the tea worthless. If the tea leaves are dried in the sun to save costs, they will be of inferior quality.

Theine and Tannin

The main components of tea leaves are theine and tannin. Theine tastes bitter and is poisonous, but the content is very low. It has the effect of treating physical and mental fatigue. Tannin has the effect of refreshing the mind and strengthening the stomach. The two combine to form tannic acid, which is easily soluble in boiling water, making people feel refreshed after drinking. Theine and tannin are mostly found in tender leaves, so high-grade tea is made from tender leaves, resulting in a better fragrance and taste. As the time the tea leaves are steeped in boiling water increases (tea leaves are not easily dissolved in lukewarm water), the soluble components also increase. The phenomenon of tannin is the most obvious. According to agricultural chemists, mist has a great influence on the growth of tea leaves. Because during the month or so from the time the tea trees sprout to the time they are picked, they receive less sunlight and more smog, the amount of theine in the tea leaves increases, while the amount of astringency decreases, reducing the bitter taste of the tea juice. On the contrary, tea leaves that receive sufficient sunlight and lack mist have the opposite composition. The value of Yunwu Tea lies in this, and this is the reason for its name.

Sold Out

Many teas sold in the market are counterfeit because the amount of tea produced in Doushuai Dong and Longqiu Bei is limited. During the tea season, it is sold out quickly. This spring, I traveled around Yandang for over a week, searching for Yunwu Tea in vain. Later, after much effort, I climbed to Longqiu Bei and, after begging, finally bought a small amount from a tea farmer, making it feel even more precious. The method of evaluating the quality of tea leaves requires considering several points, including shape, color, fire level, water color, steaming heat, aroma, taste, storage, and cultivation. However, those who are addicted to tea can tell the quality of the tea with just one sip.

During the Anti-Japanese War, due to transportation difficulties, the production of Yandang tea decreased sharply, and the local people mostly neglected it. After the victory, it gradually improved. Recently, there has been a proposal to build Yandang into an international park. The prosperity of a famous mountain also marks the time for its famous products to shine. Therefore, improving the tea-making method and widely planting tea trees are urgent tasks.

### Small Inland Waterway Ferries Should Have Ship Documents

[Report from our newspaper] The Ministry of Communications believes that many small ferries currently sailing on inland waterways do not follow regulations for handling procedures and obtaining the necessary ship documents, and are sailing on various ports without authorization, making safety questionable. In order to avoid accidents, the Ministry has specially requested the county governments to assist in conducting inspections at any time. If small ferries are found operating in the counties' jurisdiction without the necessary ship documents or with expired inspections, they should be temporarily detained. The Ministry will then order the shipping companies to complete the procedures. In addition, ships without passenger capacity certificates that carry passengers or ships with certificates that exceed the passenger limit should be strictly banned, and the excess passengers should be ordered to disembark before the ship is allowed to sail, in order to ensure safety.

Chongming

[Report from our newspaper] The unrest at Baozhen Minben Middle School is escalating. People from all walks of life held a meeting on the 25th to discuss the matter. National Army representative He Xixian, school board representative Gong Yunwen, county councilors Ni Chengzuo, Chen Tingyuan, Shen Fangcan, Shi Yunqing, and others attended. They unanimously resolved to request the school board to appoint another principal. Before the new principal is appointed, a school affairs maintenance committee will be temporarily formed to take over the school administration.

Fengxian

[Report from our newspaper] Taixian's first conscription this year was not approved for postponement despite a telegram request from the County Council. The county government is now ordering all townships to rush to complete the conscription. Regarding the settlement allowance for the new recruits, the County Recruitment Committee and township chiefs held a meeting on the 24th and decided that each recruit would receive 12 shi of rice and 1 shi of conscription fee. Although these figures are 2 shi lower than last year's standard, the people are burdened with heavy burdens, and the officials also feel deeply troubled.

Baoshan

[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Yahua, speaker of the Baoshan County Council, recently sent a telegram to Ding Zhipan, Chairman of Jiangsu Province and Commander of the Military Control Zone, requesting a postponement of the conscription. The telegram stated: Baoshan is a small county with a small area and sparse population. The total population of the county, including men, women, old, and young, is only about 110,000 to 120,000. Recently, a large number of troops have gathered, requiring the supply of side dishes and fodder, costing thousands of gold yuan per day. In addition, the construction of military projects requires materials, exceeding hundreds of millions of yuan. The order to conscript soldiers this time has left local township chiefs at a loss, and many have resigned and fled, creating a chaotic situation. Therefore, a telegram is sent to earnestly request your approval to postpone the conscription in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.

Yuyao

[Report from our newspaper] Since launching a suppression campaign in the Siming Mountain area, the Provincial Security Command's Assault Battalion has greatly weakened the potential of hidden communist bandits. Around noon on the 23rd, while searching in the Meiling area of ​​Cinan, Cixi, they uncovered a Siming Publishing House of the communist bandits. Three communist bandits were killed on the spot, and Li Bingyang (telegraph operator), Liu Mowen, and telegrapher Pan Shanbang were captured alive. A three-lamp receiver, a mimeograph machine, two hand grenades, and many communist publications were seized. The personnel and loot were sent to the Second District Commissioner's Office in Yao on the evening of the 23rd for interrogation.

Following the publication of Mr. Qiuyang's article "Chongming—the Inhalation and Exhalation Tongue of the Yangtze River" (published on page 7 of this newspaper on the 21st), it has aroused the attention of the general public. According to a letter from our Chongming correspondent, the statement in the article regarding food is quite different from the actual situation. The letter points out: (1) Chongming's main products are corn, rice, soybeans, and cotton. The food supply is sufficient to meet the needs of the island. The sale of Chongming corn and yuan wheat in the Shanghai market proves this. The statement in the original article about not having enough food for two or three months is clearly not true. (2) Chongming's cultural level is not low. Newspaper distribution points are located in all the towns and fortresses. The newspaper fee is increased by 10% of the newspaper's price and collected at the end of the month. Major Shanghai newspapers have a considerable circulation in Chongming, totaling about 1,500 copies. In Baozhen alone, every store subscribes to one or two copies on a regular basis. In addition to this newspaper, Xinmin, Ta Kung Pao, Central Daily News, Yishi, Southeast Daily, China Times, and Lih Pao are also available. This newspaper and Xinmin each account for about one-third of the total, and the rest account for the remaining one-third. Based on this, a correction should be made as above.
