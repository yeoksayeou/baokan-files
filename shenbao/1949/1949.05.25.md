### Gunfire Resounded Throughout the Night Yesterday; Liberation Army Entered the City This Morning; Defending Troops Withdrew, Sparing the Prosperous Areas

[Our Report] The People's Liberation Army entered the Shanghai city area this morning, while the defending troops also withdrew. Starting around 1:00 AM this morning, communist troops successively entered areas such as Xujiahui, Changshu, and Songshan. By around 4:00 AM this morning, they had also reached areas such as Laozha and Huangpu. Some minor skirmishes occurred in certain areas of the former French Concession, and gunfire erupted, awakening most residents from their sleep. However, because there were no artillery attacks, the prosperous areas of the city were spared from damage. Communist troops advanced slowly eastward along the Weishan Road area in detachments, with excellent discipline and order. Public and private sector employees who encountered them were checked for identification and not treated harshly, but were instructed to return to their workplaces and preserve their materials while awaiting takeover. The sound of artillery fire in the suburbs continued unabated throughout the night yesterday.

According to reports, the battle for Shanghai officially began on the 12th of this month. Over the past ten days, the focus of the struggle between the two sides has always been the strategically important areas on both banks of the Huangpu River estuary. As the focus shifted north, the city area has, in fact, lost its military value. In addition, both sides cherish the achievements of Shanghai's century of construction. Therefore, in the final stage, the prosperous areas of Shanghai were fortunately spared from the destruction of war.

### Students at Peking National University Discuss People's Grants

[Xinhua Radio, Beiping, 24th Broadcast] Students at various national universities in Beiping are now engaged in heated and serious discussions about the People's Grants. After discussion, many students have realized that the old public funding was a despicable conspiracy by the Kuomintang to deal with patriotic students. The People's Grants are the blood and sweat of the working people, who are scrimping and saving to cultivate talent for the construction of the new China. Therefore, they are voluntarily giving up their applications or lowering the level of their applications. Initially, 90% of the students at the Peking University College of Agriculture applied for grants. After discussion, the number of students applying for Class A grants decreased from 34 to 18, and two students applying for Class B changed to Class C.

### U.S. Aid Plan

Will Not Be Discussed at This Session of Congress

[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Whether the US$1.13 billion military aid to Europe plan can be discussed at this session of Congress is increasingly doubtful today. Senate leaders informally stated that the plan may be discussed at a special session this fall or at a regular session in January next year. It will definitely not be discussed before this session of Congress adjourns at the end of July or mid-August. As for the North Atlantic Treaty, it will be put to a vote at this session of Congress. It is reported that Secretary of State Acheson has requested the Senate to consider this point quickly so that the United States can receive spiritual encouragement at the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The temporary postponement of the discussion of the military aid to Europe plan is due to the fear of offending the Republicans, who are launching a campaign to cut government spending. Some senators who support the treaty have expressed coolness toward the aid plan, so the Democratic leaders will not push for discussion of this plan.

### The Republic of Germany Reborn; Bonn Celebrates with Flag Raising

Speaker Arnold said that the establishment of this constitution marked the beginning of a new era in German national history. And he said: Those who survived the process of Germany's disappearance from 1933 to 1943, today seeing the rebirth of Germany, cannot help but be excited. The city of Bonn is today hanging the black, red, and gold tricolor flag of the former German Weimar Republic. The post office has also issued commemorative stamps.

### Berlin Railway Strike; Clashes Have Not Stopped

[United Press, Berlin, 24th Dispatch] As of the 24th, the conflict caused by the Berlin elevated railway workers' strike is expected to continue for the fourth day. In the past three days of fighting, 1,200 people have been shot or beaten, and three have been shot dead. The leaders of the 15,000 anti-communist striking workers have vowed to resist the shootings by the Communist railway security forces. They have occupied all 67 elevated railway stations in West Berlin. The British occupation authorities were angered by the arbitrary shootings by the Communist anti-strikers, and last night seized two stations from the Soviet sector police security forces, and obtained their promise to abandon the other stations. After a fierce battle at the Zoologischer Garten station in the British sector, the situation became tense again. When the striking workers attacked the station, the Communist railway security forces opened fire, killing two, seriously injuring two, and slightly injuring many. Stewart, the Public Safety Director of the British military government, immediately ordered them to withdraw from the station within 20 minutes, which was accepted by the approximately 150 to 200 Communist security forces in the station. At this time, the striking workers were still surrounding and shouting, preparing to attack. The Communist security forces began to withdraw by car at midnight. West Berlin police then moved into the station. During the withdrawal, the striking workers tracked and attacked them, and were shot at again, estimated at over 50 rounds.

### Regarding the Future of Germany; The Soviet Union Will Implement a Showdown; Vyshinsky Delivers a Speech at the Foreign Ministers Conference

[Our Report] Paris, 24th Broadcast: The second meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference was held at 2:30 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on the 24th at the Palais Rose de Marbre.

US Deputy Military Governor for Germany, Huber, arrived here from Germany to accompany Acheson to attend today's meeting. It is expected that Vyshinsky will implement a showdown on the Soviet Union's new policies on German issues. The Western powers intend to give Vyshinsky the opportunity at the second meeting to explain what exactly he intends to do regarding the future of Germany.

[United Press, Paris, 24th Dispatch] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference will enter the most critical stage at 2:30 PM Greenwich Mean Time today (11:30 PM Shanghai time). After the four foreign ministers agree on the agenda, they will begin to deal with the first item on the agenda: the political and economic unification of Germany, including the issue of Allied occupation. The Western foreign ministers are awaiting Vyshinsky's opening speech on this issue so that they can get an idea of whether the Soviet Union will use this conference to continue its propaganda offensive or is indeed prepared to negotiate. Vyshinsky's speech will give him the opportunity to reveal the Soviet Union's demands. It is generally speculated that these demands will be: (1) The early withdrawal of all occupation forces stationed in Germany. (Eastern European countries made this suggestion at the Warsaw Conference). (2) The Western countries' plans. (Note: The West German Constitution was approved on the 23rd, and the establishment of West Germany is already a fait accompli, although the government and parliament will not be elected until July). (3) The Western countries relax their restrictions on trade with East Germany. (Many believe that this is the main reason for prompting the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade). The Western countries will inevitably reject any plan for an early end to the occupation until Germany becomes a peaceful and democratic country and the security of other European countries from aggression is guaranteed. The Western foreign ministers do not attach importance to Vyshinsky's suggestion regarding Japan.

### Four-Point Agenda Agreed Upon

[United Press, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] The four foreign ministers began their conference today in the Palais Rose de Marbre. The new Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyshinsky, raised the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. This is a "surprise action" that the Soviet Union likes to take at the opening of such conferences. However, some people involved in the conference believe that this move may also indicate that the Soviet Union intends to take a comprehensive ceasefire in the global Cold War. Vyshinsky did not insist on taking immediate action on this suggestion. The four foreign ministers then passed the following four-point agenda:

(1) The issue of German unification, including economic and political principles and Allied control. (2) The Berlin issue, including the issue of using a single currency throughout the city. (3) Preparing a peace treaty with Germany. (4) Studying the format of the treaty to restore the independence of Austria.

French Foreign Minister Schuman, in his capacity as host, proposed these four agenda items at the beginning of the meeting. The three Western countries had agreed on this beforehand. Vyshinsky also proposed his own agenda, which included the four-power control of Berlin and general issues in Berlin, but did not mention the Austrian issue. However, Vyshinsky immediately withdrew his agenda and accepted the four-point agenda proposed by Schuman.

The Foreign Ministers Conference finally passed Acheson's suggestion that the representatives of the four foreign ministers submit a report on the Austrian peace treaty issue by June 1.

### Vyshinsky Suddenly Proposes Discussing the Japanese Peace Treaty in a Surprising Manner; The UK and the US Did Not Agree to This Proposal and It Was Temporarily Shelved

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] After the four foreign ministers agreed on the agenda for the Foreign Ministers Conference today, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky suddenly proposed the entire issue of the Far East peace treaty in a surprising manner. He believed that the foreign ministers might also want to raise another point, namely the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. Although this was not on the agenda of this conference, it was clearly on the minds of the foreign ministers. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation was willing to know when the Foreign Ministers Conference would hold its next meeting, including China, to jointly deal with the issue of the Japanese peace treaty.

US Secretary of State Acheson replied that this was not an issue that should be raised for discussion at present. He said that when the Foreign Ministers Conference was established at the Potsdam Conference, the issue of Japan was not mentioned. Later, the Far Eastern Commission was established, specifically to discuss the issue of Japan. Therefore, the issue of Japan has nothing to do with the Foreign Ministers Conference at all. However, he was still prepared to discuss the issue raised by Vyshinsky at a later stage. As for himself, he was not prepared to discuss the issue of the Japanese peace treaty without instructions or at this current stage. Bevin supported Acheson's opinion, saying that the UK would find it difficult to agree to a Japanese peace conference not attended by New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan, and India. Vyshinsky then said that he did not suggest that this issue must be placed on the agenda of this conference, but felt that seventeen months had passed since the last Foreign Ministers Conference, so it would be worthwhile to check what issues still remained for the next conference to discuss. Vyshinsky also said that China did not participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, or the treaties with Germany and Austria, because these treaties were not directly related to China. As for the Japanese peace treaty, it was undoubtedly of direct interest to China. Chairman Schuman, the French Foreign Minister, believed that Vyshinsky's question should not be resolved at this time. Vyshinsky then agreed with this opinion. The first meeting adjourned after two and a half hours.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky issued a statement today through his spokesman Pavlov, saying that the Soviet delegation was not pessimistic about the outcome of the current Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. When reporters asked when Vyshinsky raised the issue of the Japanese peace treaty at today's meeting, emphasizing that China should be represented in the discussions on the Japanese peace treaty, which Chinese government he was referring to. Pavlov only said that Vyshinsky only referred to China. Pavlov also said that Vyshinsky raised the issue of Japan to show that he was striving for initiative. The four foreign ministers have now agreed to discuss this matter at a later stage in the current conference.

### The Current Foreign Ministers Conference; Will Take About Two Weeks

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd Dispatch] The German newspaper in the US sector claimed: According to people close to the Soviet military government, Marshal Stalin believed that the current Foreign Ministers Conference might last for two weeks.

The strategy adopted by the Soviet Union at this conference was decided by Stalin and Vyshinsky after five days of secret discussions in the Kremlin.

### The American Occupation Forces in Japan; Appear to Have Long-Term Stationing Intentions; No Concrete Plans to Transfer to Civilian Administration

[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees told the House Appropriations Committee today that the Army Department very much wants to end military administration in Japan and transfer to civilian administration, but there are no concrete plans yet.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Testimony released by the House Appropriations Committee on the 23rd revealed that the Army Department hopes that the State Department will immediately take over Japan and Germany. However, a spokesman for the Army Department believes that Japan should not be left unprotected before it can defend itself. Therefore, a considerable number of American troops will remain stationed in Japan for a long time. However, the committee recommended that in many secondary matters, whether industrial or other occupation matters, the guiding personnel should be gradually replaced by Japanese personnel instead of American personnel.

Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees and former Commander of the Eighth Army in Japan, Eichelberger, testified before the Appropriations Committee on the Army's occupation policies and wishes. Voorhees said: "The Army Department has been undertaking the occupation affairs of Japan and Germany for too long." When the Army Department will relinquish responsibility depends on when the State Department or other agencies will be ready to take over.

### Ban on Silver Dollar Trading in Beijing

Must Exchange at Official Rate at the People's Bank

[Nanjing, 20th] In order to clarify the market, stabilize prices, and protect the interests of the broad masses of people and legitimate industry and commerce, the Nanjing Military Control Commission recently issued a proclamation prohibiting the direct buying and selling of silver dollars and the use of silver dollars for paying for goods. The proclamation stipulates: (1) People are allowed to store silver dollars, but they must not directly buy, sell, or use them to pay for goods. (2) To take into account the actual difficulties of people holding silver dollars, they are allowed to exchange them at the People's Bank at the official rate. (3) All silver dollar vendors should automatically switch to other occupations. However, to take care of the few silver dollar vendors who cannot quickly switch occupations, they are allowed to register with the People's Bank, which will issue them transaction permits, temporarily allowing them to conduct transactions in designated areas.

[Nanjing People's Radio Station, 24th broadcast] The Nanjing Branch of the People's Bank of China issued a notice on the 24th stating that the registration of silver dollar vendors in the city will be closed on the 25th. Silver dollar vendors who have not registered should register quickly, and multiple registration points have been added.

### Seventeen Private Banks in Beijing Resume Business

### Gold Market Trading Inactive, Silver Dollar Market Conditions Normal

[Our Report] Yesterday's gold market saw very little trading due to a lack of interest from all parties. With supply exceeding demand, the market was unable to rise, and the intraday upper limit was 13.7594 billion, gradually approaching the off-exchange price. Trading is expected to resume today. Due to tight rumors, off-exchange trading was inactive. The morning opening was 13 billion, 16 billion, reaching as high as 15 billion, 18 billion, and the midday closing was 14 billion, 17 billion. In the afternoon, it rose again to 15 billion, 18 billion at the closing, with no significant change compared to the previous day.

Off-exchange U.S. dollars followed suit. The morning opening was 27 million, 32 million, reaching as high as 28 million, 33 million, and the midday closing remained at 28 million, 32 million. In the afternoon, there was a slight increase, rising to 30 million, 35 million. Overall trading was light, with little change in the end.

The money exchange industry was sluggish. The morning quotation was 1.3 billion, 1.6 billion, and the afternoon quotation was 1.5 billion, 1.8 billion, with no gains or losses in the end.

Yesterday, the gold and silver exchange rate was extended by two yuan, with a direct exchange rate rising from 39.42 to 40.43. One type of goods was priced at 39.42, and the other at 41.44. However, the miscellaneous foreign coins were quite popular and shortened by two yuan, falling to 46.48.

The gold and cash exchange rate was stable, remaining at 49 yuan, 51 yuan.

The cash and silver exchange rate increased by two jiao again. The direct exchange rate was 7.7 yuan, 8.2 yuan. One type of goods was priced at 7.5 yuan, 8 yuan, the other type at 7.8 yuan, 8.3 yuan, and miscellaneous foreign coins at 9 yuan, 9.5 yuan.

Some shops selling gold ornaments for silver dollars still mostly suspended trading, with a few quoting 45.50, and transactions were also rare.

### Rice, Oil, and Grains Market Still No Formal Transactions

Markets Expected to Open as Usual Today

Yesterday, the South Rice Market, Grains Market, and Cooking Oil Market were all closed. It is said that the markets are expected to open as usual today.

Yesterday, there were a few transactions beside the road in the South Rice Market. The price also weakened due to the decline in the price of gold. White japonica and thin indica rice were 300 million, but there were only sporadic transactions. The prices at rice shops varied, with indica rice around 350 million and white japonica and thin indica rice around 400 million, with slight differences in prices.

Cooking Oil: There was a slight amount of trading off-exchange, and the price continued to fall. There was a large surplus of raw rapeseed oil at 64.8 million, a drop of nearly 20%. The asking price for raw soybean oil also fell by about 10%, but there was no formal trading.

Grains: There were a few transactions outside the market on the roadside, and the market situation was roughly the same as the previous day. Mulberry Garden beans were 154.8 million yuan. This was because they were following the price of gold, so they were 20 million weaker. Jiujiang winter beans were 126 million yuan. In addition, the price of lower-grade goods in Pudong Ni Lu was 136.8 million yuan, and vegetable green beans were 172.8 million yuan. The prices all fell.

Flour: The market was flat and weak. However, the rice market has not opened, and the external situation is even more tense. All parties are still watching, and transactions are rare, totaling less than a thousand bags, all of which were minor replenishments from this street. Retail flour shops have been selling very well in recent days, because the flour price has been divorced from the rice price by a considerable margin. Most refugees are accustomed to eating flour, especially No. 4 flour, which is cheap and most popular. Yesterday, the retail price of Lao Che flour without bags was 72 million to 80 million, and Bingchuan flour was around 60 million.

### Yarn and Cloth Trading Scarce

The cotton yarn market was flat yesterday, and trading remained scarce. The prices of financial goods continued to fall, and coarse and fine yarns uniformly softened. 42-count Blue Phoenix was quoted at 4.95 million, a further decrease of 66,000. The various grades of fine yarn, including 40-count and 32-count, all fell back. The asking price for 21-count Shuangma spot goods seemed slightly higher than the previous day, but acceptance was still low. Yarn of 20 counts and below declined across the board.

Cotton cloth was affected by the stagnation of sales to customers, the lack of business at retail stores, and the trading in the market fell into a state of closure again. As for barter trade, the asking prices were even scarcer than before. The off-market asking prices for Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi serge were similar to the prices of the previous day. Except for Longfeng fine twill and other products of private factories, which fell slightly by 5 million yuan, the rest remained at the original level.

### The Eloquent Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Vyshinsky

[Special Article by Our Newspaper] Another key figure in the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, has been Molotov's right-hand man since the outbreak of World War II. In March of this year, he succeeded Molotov as Soviet Foreign Minister. Although both Molotov and Vyshinsky are favorites of the Kremlin, they are very different in terms of background and personality. Molotov is an "Old Bolshevik," tempered in the struggle of the revolution. Vyshinsky, on the other hand, grew up in a petty-bourgeois family and received formal academic education. Molotov is serious, cold, and mostly silent, while Vyshinsky likes to talk at length, is eloquent, and is witty and humorous. Therefore, many people say that Vyshinsky is not like a "Soviet-style" diplomat, but more like a Western-style diplomat.

Vyshinsky was born in 1883 in Odessa, Ukraine, and later graduated from the Faculty of Law of Kiev University. In 1902, he joined the Social Democratic Party and began to devote himself to the socialist revolution. In the following years, he engaged in revolutionary propaganda in the Caucasus region and was arrested and imprisoned several times. After the success of the revolution, he practiced law. In 1925, he was hired by Moscow University as a professor of law.

Until then, Vyshinsky was still unknown. Few people in the country knew him, and of course, no one in the international community had heard of his name. Vyshinsky became well-known and his reputation rose during the Soviet purge. At that time, he served as the prosecutor of the purge court. In the process of trying the Trotskyites and traitors, his amazing eloquence, meticulous thinking, and decisive decision-making were fully demonstrated, which laid the foundation for his political status in the country. In 1938, he was elected Vice Chairman of the People's Committee and later served as Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He served as the representative of the Soviet Union at every session of the United Nations General Assembly. In the meeting place, he often argued with the representatives of Western countries until he was red in the face. Once, he directly accused the American representative Dulles of being a "warmonger," which made the two unhappy and parted ways.

Vyshinsky's eloquence is admired by everyone who has heard his grand theory. At the last United Nations General Assembly, he debated with representatives from Britain, the United States, and Australia, fighting against many opponents with clear reasoning and forceful words, making the representatives feel that they "had to believe" him.

Last year, in a diplomatic setting, he once said: "I believe I will not see war again in my life," but then he added, "But please do not forget that I am already sixty-four years old!" These two sentences were humorous and painful. Will there be another world war in these twenty years? No one can predict. However, the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference obviously has a decisive impact on whether mankind can avoid foolish war in the near future.

The final act of the Three-Power Football Invitational Tournament, the Tung Wah vs. Ching Pak match, took place at the Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon starting at 3:30 PM. More than 8,000 spectators attended, making it a grand occasion. Both teams fielded their best players in an effort to secure a glorious victory, resulting in a series of wonderful moments. In the end, neither side scored, ending the match with a 0-0 draw. Tung Wah achieved the great feat of one win and one draw, winning the championship. Ching Pak finished second with a draw, and Railways finished third with one draw and one loss. The lineups of the Tung Wah and Ching Pak teams are listed below:

Tung Wah

Xie Xichuan Zhang Linggen

Hannibal Wu Qixiang Chen Lianglian

Li Yao Gao Xiuqing Han Longhai Qian Mingzhe Chen Mingzhe Jin Lusheng

Ching Pak

Huang Shijie

Qiang Yuanzhi Zhang Renyi Yan Shixin Meng Yiliang Jiang Qing Fu Naitang

Luo Shoufu Liu Longxin Gu Yi Liu Tiyin Fei Chunhua

Referee Fang Rongfu, linesmen Zang Wenbin, Xu Guoliang, took the field to officiate. Tung Wah chose the position, and Ching Pak kicked off. Liu Longxin advanced rapidly, and Tung Wah fully protected. Zhang Banglun rushed forward and caught the ball. Tung Wah adopted an offensive, and Han Longhai's near-goal shot went slightly wide. Ching Pak refused to be outdone and launched a collective attack. Luo Shoufu penetrated twice, but Wu Qixiang cleared the encirclement. Ching Pak still did not relax, and Liu Tiyin crossed from the sideline. Liu Longxin headed the ball, but Jin Lusheng's wild kick narrowly missed the goalpost. In the 17th minute, Tung Wah advanced with its entire team. Jiang Qing hurriedly blocked the corner kick. Li Yao took the kick, lobbing the ball to the center. Chen Lianglian jumped up and headed the ball, but Huang Shijie failed to catch it, and the ball went out of bounds. After that, Ching Pak's momentum was strong, and Liu Longxin and Luo Shoufu each had a great chance, but they did not succeed. After that, there were back-and-forth plays, with many wonderful moments. The first half ended in a 0-0 draw.

After switching sides, Ching Pak replaced Gu Yi with Liu Tiyin, and Tung Wah kept its original team. Tung Wah attacked, and Hannibal blocked Gu Yi's ball. He passed the ball to Gao Xiuqing, and Longhai broke through the center. Fortunately, Yan Shixin arrived in time to avoid the danger. In the 7th minute, Ching Pak finally turned the tide. Luo Shoufu launched a surprise attack, and Wu Qixiang made a desperate slide to clear the ball. Three minutes later, Tung Wah's Chen Mingzhe made a quick cross along the side, and Gao Xiuqing intentionally passed the ball to Li Yao, who made a bold rush towards the goal, but the ball was narrowly wide. Tung Wah continued to work hard, and from then on, Ching Pak's hinterland was filled with dangers. Meng Yiliang responded effectively, defusing the dangers several times. In the 18th minute, Ching Pak, after a long period of inactivity, prepared to make an attack. Jin Lusheng crossed the ball to the center, and Fei Chunhua received the ball and passed it to the left. Jin Lusheng made a diagonal shot at the 15-yard mark, which was fast and tricky, but unfortunately hit Zhang Banglun's arm, resulting in a corner kick. Jin kicked the corner kick, and Zhang Linggen sent the ball to the front line. In the 28th minute, Yan Shixin rested and was replaced by Qiang Yuanzhi. Ching Pak's Luo Shoufu penetrated deep on his own, and Wu Qixiang accidentally handled the ball, resulting in a free kick, which was taken by Meng Yiliang, but he was too hasty. Not long after, Tung Wah's Chen Mingzhe dribbled into the hinterland, and Qiang Yuanzhi committed a foul in defense, resulting in a free kick, which was taken by Wu Qixiang, but it went too high. The statutory time had arrived, and neither side had scored, so they shook hands and made peace. Tung Wah achieved one win and one draw, winning the championship in the three-power tournament.

### Second Division Table Tennis League: Three Matches Today

Starting Today, Change to 5:00 PM

The Fourth Table Tennis League continues today (the 25th) with three matches in the Second Division, held in the Kinmen, Post Office, and China Agricultural Bank table tennis rooms. In Second Division One, the undefeated champion Haiguang will play against Lulian. The latter has lost all four matches and may be wiped out in this match. In Second Division Two, Duxin Yi meets the Post Office 18. Both teams have lost their momentum and have lost their chances of being selected. Their skills are similar, so there will be a fierce battle. In another match, Youlian will play against China Agricultural Bank. The former has only lost once and still has hope. China Agricultural Bank's strength is mediocre and will not be a match for Youlian. The organizer announced that starting today, all match times within this week, except for Sundays, will be changed to 5:00 PM. It is hoped that all duty teams will cooperate to facilitate the event. The schedule for today and the results of previous matches are listed below:

Today's Schedule

Haiguang vs. Lulian (Second Division One) 5:00 PM Kinmen

### Refugees from Suburbs Flood into the City: Temporary Relief Committee Actively Engages in Work; Nearly 10,000 People Currently Housed

[Special Report by Our Newspaper] Since the city entered a state of war, various charitable organizations, in view of the urgent need for wartime relief work, jointly formed the "Shanghai Temporary Joint Relief Committee" on the 25th of last month. The committee consists of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, the Catholic Church, the Christian Church, the YMCA, the Children's Welfare Society, the Buddhist Association, the Renji Hall, the Tongren Fuyuantang, and other organizations. It was not until recently that the chairman of the committee, Yan Huiqing, officially announced its establishment. With the war intensifying, refugees from the suburbs have been flooding into the city, and the committee's work has suddenly become busy, with relief efforts actively underway. Yesterday, reporters visited the committee's office, located in the Renji Shanzhuang at No. 35 Yunnan Middle Road, and were told the details as follows:

Several Young Men and Women Apply to Join the Work

The committee is currently responsible for promoting the work through the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee has one chairman, Yan Huiqing, and four vice-chairmen: former Minister of Finance Li Sihao, charitable figure Dong Hanzhi, former Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, and Kuai Yanfang of the Siming Public Hall. Yan himself is unable to participate in the actual work due to illness at Zhongshan Hospital, so Li Sihao is currently responsible for most of the committee's main administration. Other members of the Standing Committee include Zhu Kongjia, Xu Yongzuo, Lu Meiseng, Lu Ganchen, Xu Guomao, Hong Nianzhi, Shou Jingwei, An Qing, Zeng Fu, Hong Shihao, Sun Yongyi, Yan E'sheng, Yan Fuqing, Zhu Heng, and Zhu Huaiping. The Standing Committee meets every Wednesday and Saturday to jointly plan the relief work. As for all the committee's actual affairs, they are handled by the general secretary Zhao Puchu and deputy general secretary Li Wenjie. There are subordinate groups for general affairs, supplies, accommodation, children, burial, and repatriation, which assist each other. In addition to providing lunch to the staff, all are volunteer positions and are deployed by the participating organizations. Yesterday, the reporter saw several young men and women automatically applying to join the work, which shows that there are still enthusiastic people in society. The committee temporarily declined, as there is no need for them at present.

In addition to Relieving Refugees, It Also Plans to Rescue the Sick and Wounded

The main task of the committee, in addition to relieving refugees, is to engage in the rescue of the sick and wounded when necessary. Due to the limitations of manpower and resources, all actual work is, in principle, handled by the participating organizations themselves, and the committee stands in a guiding position to assist them. For example, the Renji Hall has now accommodated more than 200 refugees who have fled from the Dachang area. Also, the orphanage, monastery, and observatory established by the Catholic Church in Xujiahui have also accommodated 3,200 refugees. The vegetable market at No. 16 Pu also accommodates more than 2,000 people. There are currently nine refugee shelters of this type, which are handled by various organizations themselves and assisted by the committee. They are scattered throughout the city and currently accommodate nearly 10,000 people, and the number is increasing daily.

The committee's source of funds, in addition to the Ministry of the Interior allocating 2,700 bags of rice and 1,000 bags of flour from the materials stored in Shanghai, as well as more than 500 bundles of old clothes for relief, also includes donations from the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund of rice, milk powder, cod liver oil, and methicillin, totaling hundreds of tons, and 900 bags of cotton yarn donated by the Joint Distribution Agency. The reporter asked whether the committee could obtain any assistance from the International Red Cross, which was recently reported to be planning to carry out relief work in the city. The answer was: The committee has not yet had any contact with the International Red Cross.

Enthusiastic People Donate Cash and Goods

In recent days, the war has become increasingly urgent, and the number of refugees has increased sharply. Yesterday, it was learned that there were thousands of refugees in Pudong who could not cross the river. Upon hearing the news, the committee immediately allocated flour and urgently asked the Pudong Fellow Association to find a way to make steamed buns and send them over. Currently, the committee is deeply worried about the limited resources, while the number of refugees continues to increase. If this continues, it is feared that it will be unable to sustain itself. Therefore, it is hoped that enthusiastic people in society can act in the spirit of helping others as they would help themselves, work together in the same boat, and jointly find a solution. Donations, whether cash or in kind, are welcome. If people in society have vacant houses that can accommodate 30 to 50 people and are willing to accommodate refugees, the committee is also willing to provide the necessary materials and provide assistance at any time.

### Legal Clarifications

[Mr. He Zhicheng asked] (1) After I formally married Miss So-and-so in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), I was working outside and the economy was difficult, so I had my wife stay with my in-laws. Unexpectedly, a sudden change occurred last year, and she ran away with all the clothes and ornaments in the house. I asked for leave and returned to my hometown to negotiate with my in-laws. The mother of the girl asked two relatives and friends to mediate. The mother of the girl admitted that her daughter had run away with the money and belongings and was willing to act as her full representative in public. It was decided to draw up a contract to terminate the relationship between husband and wife, and both parties each held a copy, stating that after the contract was signed, the man and woman would be free to marry or remarry, and both parties would publish a statement in the newspaper at the same time. There has been no response for several months. I don't know if it is legally effective. (2) If a friend introduces me to Miss So-and-so in the future, can I marry her? (3) If the runaway wife finds out after the marriage, can she sue her husband for abandonment and bigamy? (4) What kind of procedures should be followed to resolve the matter permanently?

[Answer] (1) If a husband and wife both agree to a divorce, it should be done in writing and should have the signatures of two or more witnesses. According to the situation described in the letter, the divorce should be supplemented by the wife's signature to be legally effective. (2) You can remarry after the divorce. (3) In fact, I don't think there will be any problems. (4) Follow the answer method in the first item.

[Mr. Wang Yiqian asked] When my father was alive, he rented the house where we lived to a Mr. Shao, a businessman, because our family was leaving Shanghai. The two parties agreed on a term of seven years, and there are still two years left, and a contract was signed, stipulating that it could not be sublet to others. After my father passed away, the tenant moved to another place. Because the term of our house had not expired, we were willing to keep it empty and refused to return it. Now our family has returned to Shanghai from another port and requested to move back, but permission was not granted. Now I suddenly heard that Mr. Shao had a relative move in. After blocking it, it was ineffective. Now I have a few questions and ask for answers. (1) Is their action legal without our consent? (2) If it cannot be resolved, can we sue them in court? (3) If the term has not expired and they do not live in it, can we ask them to move out? (4) Are the litigation costs affordable for ordinary people?

[Answer] (1) Since the lease contains a provision that subletting is not allowed, the lessee subletting the house to others without the lessor's consent is a violation of the lease. (2) You can sue them in court. (3) If the lessee closes the house and does not use it for six months, the term of the lease has not expired, you can request to terminate the lease. (4) The litigation costs are standardized by the court.
