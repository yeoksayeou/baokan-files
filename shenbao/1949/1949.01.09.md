### Government Efforts to Promote Peace: Invitation to Four Nations to Mediate, Meeting Between Zhang Qun and Bai Chongxi

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] In the days of awaiting the Communist Party's formal response to the President's peace appeal, the government has already begun to invite the four major powers to mediate the issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, so as to promote the early realization of peace. On the 8th, it was confirmed that this formal invitation and the solutions proposed by the government have been sent out. This is the greatest manifestation of the government's efforts for peace. Many people are watching for the appearance of this glimmer of hope, hoping that the Communist Party will announce its agreement to resume peace talks as soon as possible. However, when reporters inquired about the above news from government officials, they all answered with a silent attitude. The reporter also visited a senior official who has made many efforts for peace. He confirmed the authenticity of the above news, but said that he had not yet received a reply from the other party.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] It is confirmed that Wu Tiecheng, concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, invited the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France to meet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the evening of the 8th. However, the Ministry and the embassies declined to comment on the content of the meeting. According to reliable sources, the Chinese government has asked the three ambassadors to ask their governments to mediate for peace. The fact that the Soviet ambassador was not present has aroused speculation. It is said that he was ordered by Moscow to avoid participating in the mediation.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] It was learned today that most of the peace activities are now centered on Vice President Li Zongren. Li has repeatedly met with Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi and others.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Zhang Qun flew to Hankou by special plane on the morning of the 8th at the invitation of Bai Chongxi.

Those present included Zhang Dulun, Zhang Zhen, and Huang Shaohong. It is confirmed that Zhang came here at the invitation of Commander-in-Chief Bai. He reported to the President before leaving.

### Strengthening Military-Political Coordination and Recognizing the Stance on Peace and War: Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area General Headquarters Cables Military and Political Leaders in Its Jurisdiction

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] The Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area General Headquarters recently sent a telegram to the military and political leaders in its jurisdiction, urging them to strengthen military-political coordination and recognize the stance on peace and war. The original telegram expounded on the President's proclamation of the principle of being able to pursue both peace and war, emphasizing the proposition that peace can only be achieved through strength. The wording was extremely clear, concise, and sincere. The conclusion of the document is recorded below: "Now the people are eager for peace, and the government is willing to realize peace. Public opinion and the government have reached a consensus. The opportunity for peace has been opened. However, the key is that the Chinese Communists can suddenly realize and sincerely accept it. Otherwise, if they continue to engage in military aggression and exploit the people, violating public opinion, it will still be impossible to realize true peace. At this critical turning point, administrative leaders at all levels and all officers and soldiers should be aware of the difficulties of the times, confirm that both war and peace are possible, and especially believe that peace can only be achieved through strength. They should still actively prepare for war, strengthen military-political coordination, hold their posts, and do their best without the slightest slackness, so as not to be taken advantage of by the enemy. It is hoped that everyone will be of one mind, unite and fight hard, and save the country from danger in order to achieve peace. This is what is greatly hoped."

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] According to a senior official close to Zhang Qun, the views of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area authorities and local figures on the current issues of peace and war are completely in line with those of the central government. The rumor that the reaction from all walks of life in Wuhan after the President's proclamation was quite uneasy is purely speculation. When a public opinion organ discusses a certain issue, there may be differences and intense debates, but its final conclusion is still consistent with the government. Judging from Commander-in-Chief Bai's telegram to his subordinates, it can be seen that the sincerity of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area in seeking peace through war can be said to be firm and clear.

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 8th] Jiangxi Chairman Hu Jiafeng exceptionally received our reporter in his office on the morning of the 8th and spoke freely about Jiangxi's administration and peace talks. After the President's New Year's Day proclamation, Hu believes that the national government has repeatedly sought peace, and whether the peace talks can succeed depends on sincerity and integrity. Today, we should be prepared for war to seek peace, and prepare for war to seek peace talks. Hu believes that the rumor that Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces are making political contacts is unfounded. He solemnly stated that he has not received any letters or contacts of the above-mentioned nature in the past or in the future.

### Presidents of Zhejiang University and Xiangya Medical College Talk About Peace Issues

Both Eagerly Hope for Early Realization

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 8th] Our reporter visited the famous Zhejiang University in Hangzhou on the 8th. Due to financial difficulties, the rooms have not been heated. President Zhu Kezhen received the reporter in the president's office wearing a coat and told him about the difficulties. Zhu modestly said that he does not understand politics, but he is very much in favor of peace. Since both sides claim to be fighting for the people, they should lay down their arms now that the people demand peace. He was very saddened by the loss of China's lofty international status due to the civil war. He said: Now that India is convening an Asian conference, we should reflect and feel ashamed, and then strive to improve. The reporter then visited many professors at the school, and they all eagerly hoped for the early realization of peace. In addition, Zhejiang University will have a big exam next week, and the issue of relocating the school has not been considered, and the Ministry of Education has not given any instructions.

[Central News Agency Changsha Dispatch, 8th] Hu Shuhua, President of National Henan University, recently talked to reporters about the issue of peace. Hu said in an extremely painful tone: "Only with peace can China be saved. This is true not only for the people under the rule of the central government, but also for the people under the rule of the Communist Party, because if the fighting continues, the country will really be beyond repair, and the people's suffering will be too deep and too heavy." He continued: "Hunan cannot be ruined again. The losses suffered during the Anti-Japanese War were greater than those of any other province. If it is ravaged by war again, Hunan's vitality will be completely lost." When asked how to achieve peace, Hu hoped that public opinion organs in various provinces would launch and lead the people to expand the movement to call for peace.

General Du Yuming commanded 120,000 elite soldiers and engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat with the remnants of Liu and Chen's bandit troops in the icy and snowy ground on the line of Qinglongji, Lulou, and Suixikou. The battle situation was extremely fierce. The air force also cooperated in the clear sky to assist in the battle. The bandit troops suffered heavy casualties. Therefore, Liu's bandits in Nanping rushed to reinforce them. There are currently no battles in the areas of the Hui, Xie, and Fei rivers. According to the spokesman of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area General Headquarters, a small number of bandit remnants in Huaibei will never be able to attack Bengbu. As for the scattered bandits such as the Huainan Independent Brigade in eastern Jinpu Road, after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army for days, only 5,000 to 6,000 people are left. They fled northeastward from the area between Tianchang, Lai'an, and Xuyi, attempting to flee to northern Jiangsu.

### Northern Jiangsu Coastal Area Is Peaceful; Command Structure Will Be Adjusted Soon; Zhou Yan Expresses Optimism About the Future of the War

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 8th] The battlefield in northern Jiangsu is generally peaceful. Since the National Army stationed in Gaoyou and Tianchang, Yangzhou has become more stable. The highways of Yangtai, Yangzhen, and Yangyou are all clear. The northern Jiangsu coastal area, including Haimen, Qidong, Nantong, Rugao, Jingjiang, Taixing, Taixian, Yangzhou, Yizheng, and Liuhe counties, is under the control of the National Army. After the East China bandit army was defeated in Xuzhou and Bengbu, it seems that it is still difficult to carry out large-scale operations in northern Jiangsu for a while. The bandits currently in northern Jiangsu are all local communists under the command of the "Military Region," but their strength is quite large. According to Zhou Yan, the bandits can reorganize this local communist army into a column number at any time. The reason why they don't do this is to avoid the attention of the authorities.

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 8th] Zhou Yan, Commander of the First Pacification District, told our reporter today that to defend the Yangtze River, we must first protect the Huai River. Otherwise, for the sake of protecting Nanjing and Shanghai, we should at least ensure the three strongholds of Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Tongzhou in northern Jiangsu. Zhou seemed optimistic about the future of the war. He said that if the war were to extend to the Yangtze River, we would have the coordination of the navy in addition to the land and air forces, which would be a more advantageous condition. Zhou was not satisfied with the current connections between all levels of society in northern Jiangsu. He hopes that the local gentry and representatives of public opinion in his jurisdiction can understand the difficulties of the times and not unnecessarily restrain the work of military and political leaders. According to reports, Zhou was summoned to Nanjing by Tang Enbo on the 2nd for consultations and returned to Yangzhou on the evening of the 6th. It is said that it was decided during the talks that the command structure in northern Jiangsu would be adjusted soon.

Editorial

### The Change of U.S. Secretary of State: From Marshall to Acheson

U.S. Secretary of State Marshall resigned due to illness, which has been approved by President Truman. Upon the news, the world was not surprised by this change of Secretary of State, because the rumors about Marshall's fatigue had been circulating for a long time. At the same time, when President Truman announced Marshall's resignation, he made it clear that U.S. foreign policy would not change due to the change of Secretary of State. In other words, it will support the United Nations organization to maintain world peace on the one hand, and deal with the Soviet Union with a firm attitude on the other, without softening. However, in today's turbulent world situation and the indecision of the United States, the change of U.S. Secretary of State is, in any case, the first major world event of 1949. It will have a significant impact on the United States itself and all countries in the world, especially at a time when the Eighty-first New Congress has just opened and is about to make new decisions on U.S. foreign policy, it has a very profound meaning.

We summarize the opinions of Washington, London, Paris, and major cities around the world, and all express regret for the resignation of Secretary of State Marshall; and at the same time, all express welcome for Acheson's succession as Secretary of State. Because Marshal Marshall, as President Truman said, is "the greatest soldier in the United States," and has made unparalleled and brilliant contributions to winning World War II. When he first took office as Secretary of State, the world expected him to work with other United Nations to create world peace with the perseverance and strategy of warfare. However, since he took office as Secretary of State two years ago, the world situation has changed unpredictably, and he has been unable to do what he wants. The polarization of the world shattered the world's illusion of "one world." The U.S.-Soviet "Cold War" has intensified due to the active implementation of the Marshall Plan in Western Europe. The deterioration of the Berlin crisis almost made the "Cold War" also bleed and heat up, turning into a real international war. In order to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union, President Truman originally planned to send senior officials to Moscow for direct negotiations, but this was dismissed because Marshall returned from Paris to Washington to express his disagreement. However, the two men, Marshall and Truman, had differences of opinion on foreign policy. Although President Truman has repeatedly denied it, the existence of objective facts cannot be concealed. In addition, Truman won the general election last year, and the Democratic Party regained its majority in the Eighty-first New Congress. President Truman needs to unify his foreign policy even more, so Marshall's resignation was inevitable.

As for the new Secretary of State Acheson, he was called a "outstanding talent" by former Secretary of State Hull. In 1941, he served as Assistant Secretary of State, in charge of world economic affairs, and vigorously advocated that the United States should actively assist Britain and the Soviet Union. He was intelligent and capable, and was always valued by Secretary of State Hull. Later, when Byrnes was Secretary of State, he was promoted to Under Secretary of State in August 1945, and became one of the decision-makers of American foreign policy. Even when Marshal Marshall returned to China to take on difficult tasks, he remained as Under Secretary of State until he resigned in May 1947 and left American political circles to resume his lawyer duties. Acheson was originally known as a "practical liberal" in his thinking. Because he vigorously advocated aid to the Soviet Union during the war, he was also known as a "pro-Soviet diplomat." However, on the eve of his departure, he announced in Congress that "the Soviet Union is an imperialist seeking expansion." Most people did not understand his 180-degree turn. In fact, it is very simple, because he is actually responsible for American diplomacy and knows that the Soviet Union's obstruction of peace and the destruction of international agreements have turned him to adopt a tough anti-Soviet policy. He has a famous saying that has been recited around the world: "Moscow's policy is contrary to the basis of international coordination and revitalization." Acheson's appointment as Secretary of State this time will surely enable him to display his talents, so he is unanimously welcomed by the American government and the public.

Acheson also has his own unique views on the China issue. He once said, "The main goal of the United States is to assist China in unifying and establishing a unitary army; and to provide economic assistance to the coalition government composed of various Chinese parties." Based on this, United Nations personnel at Lake Success believe that Acheson's appointment as Secretary of State will have a direct impact on the development of the China issue, which is not an unfounded statement. The new U.S. Congress opened on the 3rd, and will make new decisions on the future foreign policy of the United States. This change of Secretary of State may be the beginning of a change in U.S. foreign policy.

### Executive Yuan Approves Adjustment of Public Education Treatment; Implemented Starting This Month and a Bonus Will Be Issued for One Month; Collective Savings Will Be Abolished and Public Petitions Will Be Prohibited; Yu Hongjun, President of the Central Bank, Dismissed

[Nanjing, Eighth Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The 34th meeting of the Executive Yuan on the eighth approved the adjustment of public education personnel's salaries starting in January. The areas of Beijing and Shanghai will receive one and a half times their December salaries, which is 15 times the price limit of August 19. At the same time, in order to sympathize with the difficult lives of public education personnel, the government decided to issue an additional month's salary based on the adjusted salary amount for January, called the year-end bonus. The adjustment amounts in various regions of the country are not exactly the same. The principle is that the adjustment amounts are larger for those closer to the war zone. In addition, combat officers and soldiers will each receive two silver dollars as a year-end bonus.

[Nanjing, Eighth Dispatch from the Central News Agency] The Executive Yuan decided to adjust the treatment of civil and military personnel according to the calculation method in November, divided into zones one, two, three, four, and special zones.

[Nanjing, Eighth Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Yu Hongjun, President of the Central Bank, was dismissed for improper handling of gold and silver dollar savings and exchanges, which caused dissatisfaction from many parties. At the political meeting on the eighth, Finance Minister Xu first reported on the savings and exchanges of gold and silver, stating that the Central Bank had made some changes in the procedures for handling the savings and exchanges, but failed to report to the Ministry of Finance in advance, which seemed to have decided without authorization, and the errors in some procedures had led to today's uncontrollable situation of panic buying and withdrawals. After Xu's report, many committee members also felt it was inappropriate. Someone then suggested summoning Yu Hongjun to Beijing to report on the process of handling the savings and exchanges, but most people were still dissatisfied. It was decided to dismiss him, and Xu, the Finance Minister, will temporarily serve concurrently in his vacant position.

[Nanjing, Eighth Dispatch from the Central News Agency] At the Executive Yuan meeting on the eighth, Finance Minister Xu Kan reported on the request of some civil servants in Beijing to handle collective gold and silver savings and exchanges for military police and public education employees of the Central Bank in Shanghai at the old prices, and submitted a solution for public resolution. The Executive Yuan decided: (1) The Central Bank's handling of collective gold and silver savings and exchanges for military police and public education employees has different methods in Beijing and Shanghai, which is inappropriate. Personnel should be sent to thoroughly investigate and discuss the matter. The original collective gold and silver savings and exchanges method for military police and public education employees in Shanghai should be abolished immediately, and Nanjing should not use it as an example. (2) The lives of military police and public education employees are difficult. Their salaries have been adjusted, and an additional month's salary has been added in another case, which will be implemented soon.

[Further Dispatch] The Executive Yuan resolved on the eighth that, during the current period of martial law, all civil servants should work diligently and not gather to petition, obstructing public affairs. The chiefs of various levels should be responsible for restraining their subordinates and absolutely prohibiting unauthorized actions and violations of laws and regulations. If there are any deliberate violations, the highest commanders in each martial law area should strictly implement the provisions of Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the Martial Law Act. The Executive Yuan has issued notices to all ministries, commissions, and bureaus, and sent letters to other agencies and notified the military police agencies to investigate accordingly.

### Rising Prices and Increased Issuance; the Taiwan Dollar is Facing a Severe Test; the Provincial Government is Using Two Methods to Prevent Inflation

[Taipei, Eighth Dispatch from the United Press] The New Taiwan dollar, which has always been relatively stable, is now facing a severe test. Wealthy households and government personnel have been flocking here, prices are gradually rising, and the amount of currency in circulation is constantly increasing. In 1945, the total amount of currency issued by the Bank of Taiwan was 280 million New Taiwan dollars. By the end of 1946, it had increased to 500 million. By the end of 1948, it probably exceeded 10 billion. However, according to the general manager of the bank, half of the amount of currency issued is loaned to state-owned enterprises, the most prominent being the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and the Power Company, operated by the National Resources Commission, with the aim of promoting production enterprises, so it should be regarded as investment. Although it looks like inflation, it is actually to support production, and the New Taiwan dollar itself can be maintained by this. For example, for Taiwan Sugar to produce 40,000 tons, it needs 10 million yuan in funds, including fertilizers, agricultural loans, repair of machinery, and railway transportation, but the profits it can obtain can also be 10 million yuan. The Taiwan Provincial Government is currently using two methods to prevent inflation. One is to adjust the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar against the Gold Yuan at any time, and the other is to stimulate production to absorb floating capital. However, last year's central currency reform and the devaluation of the Gold Yuan have already affected the New Taiwan dollar. In the 72 days after August 19, the amount of currency issued suddenly increased from 2 billion to 8 billion. Later, due to the insistence of the former Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming, the Ministry of Finance agreed to adjust the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar against the Gold Yuan at any time. However, it is still difficult to predict whether this measure is sufficient to offset the increase in the amount of New Taiwan dollars issued and the purchasing power of the market.

### Middle East Situation Becomes Serious; British Troops Enter Transjordan; Five British Aircraft Shot Down Over Egypt; Britain Protests to Israel, Declares Right to Freedom of Action

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 8th (Radio from Tel Aviv): The Israeli government announced that four British aircraft and one aircraft of unknown nationality were shot down over southern Palestine on the 7th by Israeli fighter planes. A British Air Force communiqué released in London confirmed that the fifth aircraft shot down was also British. The communiqué stated that five British aircraft were missing and condemned the attack on British aircraft over Egyptian territory by Israeli aircraft. At the same time, an Israeli spokesperson accused British aircraft of firing on Israeli positions in Nikif, and said that twelve British aircraft carrying bombs flew in formation to attack four Israeli fighter planes. Britain has now protested to Israel and declared its right to take further action. Britain does not recognize Israel, so there are no diplomatic relations between the two countries. The protest was lodged by the British representative to the Israeli representative at a session of the Security Council. The British Foreign Office has already thoroughly reviewed the entire Jewish question.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 8th (Radio): There has been a shocking development in the shooting down of British aircraft by Israeli troops.

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The Philippines denounced the Security Council on the 7th for allowing the Netherlands to crush the Republic of Indonesia. Philippine representative Romulo condemned the positions taken by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands during the Security Council debate. He declared that 100 million people in Asia are being forced to consider non-military action to oppose Dutch actions. Romulo specifically mentioned the upcoming New Delhi Conference as foreshadowing "further united action" on the Indonesian issue, and said that the United Nations must remember that "the only way to democratize Asia is to give Asia freedom and give the people of Asia equal partnership in a better world. I ask the Security Council to consider this event and the human values related to this issue, first for all of Asia, and then for the entire world." In addition to Romulo's speech, during the Security Council debate on the afternoon of the 7th, Dutch representative Van Royen claimed that the Dutch "police action" had been completed, laying the foundation for the Indonesian Federation supported by Queen Juliana and her cabinet. Indonesian representative Palar retorted that the Netherlands was "fooling" the Security Council and that the Indonesian people had only "resistance to aggression and engaged in a war of self-defense." Australian representative Makin told the Security Council that when the Security Council's orders are being defied in Indonesia, "it is impossible to act like an ostrich and bury its head in the sand of Lake Success." Makin argued that the Netherlands should give Indonesian leaders complete freedom, withdraw troops from the conquered areas, and resume negotiations through the Committee of Good Offices. Egyptian representative Fawzi, who has just taken office as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, also joined in condemning Dutch policy, saying that if the Security Council succumbs to "this extremely bad fait accompli," it will endanger the entire future of the United Nations. Indian representative Ramalau accused the Netherlands of using U.S. aid to break Indonesia, which was "undermining the purpose of the European Recovery Program." The Committee of Good Offices reported to the Security Council that the Netherlands had not complied with the Security Council's ceasefire order and the order to release Indonesian leaders. The representatives of the five major powers did not speak at the meeting today. The Security Council adjourned today and will reconvene on the 11th to allow time to consider the report of the Committee of Good Offices.

### Acheson Succeeds as U.S. Secretary of State; Western European Countries Express Welcome; The World Watches His Future Diplomatic Moves

[United Press, London, 7th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said on the 7th that the whole world, especially Europe, regretted the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Marshall. He continued, "His successor, Acheson, is no stranger to us, and he will certainly obtain our assurance of continued cooperation." Bevin's farewell to Secretary Marshall represented the highest reaction in Europe to Washington's announcement that Secretary Marshall would resign on the 20th. Western officials were clearly dizzy as to whether this change would remove the iron hand of Marshall, who restricted Truman's direct participation in international affairs.

Eastern European diplomats expressed their views and personal hopes that this shift would change the US's Cold War policy, replacing it with a slightly more moderate attitude toward the Soviet Union. Berlin Soviet District Mayor Ebert said he believed Marshall's resignation might ease US foreign policy slightly. Eastern Europe and those who did not support the US Cold War strategy expressed joy at Marshall's resignation. One "Iron Curtain" diplomat said, "It was Marshall who prevented Truman from sending Chief Justice Vinson to Moscow."

But for now, most European officials are preparing to accept Truman's promise that "there will be no change in the US diplomatic government," but made it clear that they are adopting a wait-and-see policy.

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] Chinese representative to the United Nations Jiang Tingfu praised the "personality and talent" of the new US Secretary of State Acheson on the 7th, but did not mention Marshall at all.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] Washington observers believe that Marshall's resignation and Acheson's succession as Secretary of State may lead US foreign policy to be more inclined toward liberalism. Although the overall outline of US foreign policy may not be changed, Acheson may make some modifications. However, these observers believe that the US policy toward the Soviet Union will not change in any way and will continue to adopt a consistently tough stance. However, this does not mean that he will close the door to peace talks. From now on, US foreign policy will be entirely in the hands of civilians. The appointment of economic expert Webb as Deputy Secretary of State may indicate that economic issues will occupy an unprecedentedly important position in US foreign policy.

### Acheson's Brief Biography

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] US Secretary of State Acheson was born in Tietown, Connecticut on April 11, 1895. He studied law at Harvard University and Yale University, and then practiced law. During World War I, he served as an officer in the US Navy, and after the war, he served as the private secretary to Supreme Court Justice Brandeis. He served as Undersecretary of the Treasury from May to November 1933, Assistant Secretary of State in 1941, and Acting Undersecretary of State in 1945. Acheson is known for advocating liberalism.

Acheson, 55, served under Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, assisting Secretaries of State Hull, Stettinius, and Byrnes for about six years until he resigned as Deputy Secretary six months after Marshall became Secretary of State. Initially, Acheson seemed to follow President Roosevelt's post-war pro-Soviet policy, leading to criticism from his colleagues. Later, he strived to establish that "a true peace in the world has not been realized, and conflicts between the Soviet Union and Western countries are rampant," and turned to adopting a tough anti-communist stance. His last speech in office accused the Soviet Union of obstructing peace and undermining important international agreements, and the phrase "Moscow's policy runs counter to the foundations of international coordination and reconstruction" has been widely circulated. The two major Cold War offensives of the US during Marshall's tenure, namely military aid to Greece and Turkey and the European Recovery Program, were all planned with Acheson's assistance.

### Representatives of British Dominions Suggest Forming Eastern Anti-Communist Alliance; Urge Britain to Change Attitude Toward Indonesia

[Report from this newspaper] London, 8th (Radio): It is reported that representatives of British Dominions have submitted a request to the British government to organize an Eastern anti-aggression alliance in Asia similar to the Western alliance. Senior officials from various countries have presented evidence proving that after World War II, the Soviet Union is exploiting the national concepts of various Southeast Asian countries for other purposes. Official news said that representatives visited the British Foreign Office today, which is clearly related to the British Foreign Secretary Strong's trip to Southeast Asia.

[United Press, London, 8th] The High Commissioners of India, Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand met with British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the morning of the 8th, strongly arguing that in order to prevent communism from invading from China to the south, it is necessary to obtain the friendship of the Republic of Indonesia, so Britain should show greater sympathy to Indonesia. Officials said that Britain had agreed on the 7th on a strategy to oppose communism in Southeast Asia, and Britain had suggested to the United States that it convene a meeting of relevant countries to strengthen the anti-communist camp of Asian democratic countries. The joint action of the four countries' representatives in London is said to be closely related to the upcoming New Delhi Asian Conference. Authorities pointed out that when the New Delhi Asian Conference was held last year, Asian Soviet countries also participated, but Indian Prime Minister Nehru did not invite Soviet countries to attend this time, which is indeed worth noting. The Foreign Office learned on the morning of the 8th that Indian Commissioner Menon intends to strongly advocate to Bevin the urgency of recognizing the Indonesian national faction and other expectations.

### Japanese General Election Approaching; Various Parties Fighting Fiercely Behind the Scenes

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Japan will hold its third post-war House of Representatives election on the 23rd of this month, with the US occupation policy serving as an election gimmick. The extreme parties have long opposed the US economic plan for Japan, and most voters will take a middle course. There are 466 seats in the House of Representatives, with nearly 1,400 candidates, including 43 women. Only 40 of all the candidates are current members, about 900 are newcomers, and the rest are former members of the House of Representatives. Regardless of which party is in power, the Japanese people only hope to live and work in peace, but the parties are fighting fiercely behind the scenes. The recent US economic austerity order for Japan was caused by this. Various political parties are secretly using the name of the new US policy to carry out their own policy propaganda.

Within less than ten days, our compatriots across the country have unanimously called for its realization, which shows that peaceful unification is the same in everyone's mind. What Heaven sees and the people see, what Heaven hears and the people hear, the likes and dislikes of the people are already obvious. This association has sent a winter telegram inviting your association to jointly advocate, which I hope has been noted. However, I believe that peace is not something that can be achieved overnight and depends on the collective efforts of the people. This association believes that Shanghai is the location of several peaceful unification meetings since the Xinhai Revolution. The historical facts of success are still fresh in our memory, and the convenient transportation and the attention of China and foreign countries are especially conducive to the peace movement. Therefore, I suggest that the National Peace Promotion Assembly be solemnly convened in Shanghai on "February 10" of this year. I respectfully request that the speakers and deputy speakers of the senates of all provinces and cities or their designated responsible representatives, and the directors of various national professional organizations or mutually elected standing directors, come to Shanghai as soon as possible to discuss and promote peace. This association will do its best to entertain you sincerely. I firmly believe that the President and the government have already revealed peace and will adopt public opinion. The gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party must also be aware of the trend of public opinion, change their plans, stop the war, and make peace so that our people can recuperate and restore their vitality. Moreover, if both parties can reopen peace talks, some methods may not be without controversy along the way. Then, the task of mediating and resolving disputes, our public opinion representatives and professional representatives from all over the country, cannot shirk their responsibilities, and we come from all over the country and know the sufferings of the people better. We can also take advantage of the peace promotion assembly to contribute good plans for the rejuvenation of politics. When things reach their extreme, they will be restored, and new opportunities have emerged. I urge all gentlemen of your association to be happy to come, peace is fortunate, the people are fortunate, and I respectfully await your instructions. Shanghai Municipal Senate Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing respectfully bowed and sealed."

More Than 5,000 People Benefited from the Emergency Medical Assistance Society; President Chiang Inscribes a Plaque, Worthy of the Ten Directors [Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Citizens' Emergency Medical Assistance Society has been established for more than two years, and has benefited more than 5,000 poor and sick people. Its work has been remarkable. The President, recognizing its commendable enthusiasm, specially inscribed a plaque with the words "Broadly Aiding Humanity" to commend it. The Municipal Government, in order to reward the directors of the society, specially photographed and reduced the plaque given by the President, cast it in silver, and inlaid it with a rectangular ivory piece, on which Mayor Wu inscribed a poem. The frame was adorned with mahogany, for a total of ten plaques, which were distributed to the ten directors of the society. Mayor Wu also hosted a tea party at the City Hall at 4:00 PM yesterday to entertain people from all walks of life, and held an award ceremony. Attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zhang Wei, Fan Zhengbo, Yan Duhe, Keswick, President of the British Chamber of Commerce, Edward, representative of the American Relief Administration in China, members of the City Government Advisory Committee, and all the directors of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society: Rong Hongyuan (representing), Tang Yeru, Wang Qin Sun, Wang Tongyuan, Wu Zhongyi, Lu Jusen, Xue Zuheng (representing), Tang Shuming, Fu Liangjun, Gu Qianlin, and representatives of the Shuping Public Scholarship Association, who were responsible for the society's service work, totaling more than 200 people. Mayor Wu first delivered a speech, explaining the significance of the tea party. Then, Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei reported on the situation of the society. Immediately afterwards, the award ceremony was held, with Mayor Wu personally presenting the plaques to each director, and the attending guests responded with enthusiastic applause. Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan, Keswick, Edward, and Fan Zhengbo delivered speeches respectively. Finally, Gu Qianlin, director and president of the society, delivered a thank you speech. The tea party adjourned at around 6:00 PM. Excerpts from Mayor Wu and others' speeches are as follows:
The Motivation to Help Others is Most Worthy of Praise Mayor Wu stated: The Municipal Government awarded Zhang Hanting the honorary citizen medal last week, believing that his spirit of great virtue, great benevolence, and great courage was worthy of praise. Today, presenting the plaque inscribed by the President to the Emergency Medical Assistance Society has the same significance and is worthy of commemoration. Some people believe that there are many bad people and bad things in Shanghai, but in fact, there are also many good people and good deeds. The wicked should be punished, and the good should be praised. Therefore, a plaque presentation ceremony was specially held, and a tea party was held to entertain people from all walks of life for encouragement. Director Zhang reported: The society was established on October 1, 1946, and has been in existence for two years and three months. In the first year, more than 1,400 people were assisted, and more than 800 million legal tender was spent on loans. In the second year, more than 11.4 billion legal tender was spent on assistance, benefiting more than 5,000 people. The society's expenses are not raised from external donations, but are entirely determined by the basic directors themselves. Chairman Rong Hongyuan recognizes 50%, and the rest is recognized by the directors. What I think is commendable is not the number of people saved or the money spent, but the motivation to help others. This spirit of charity must be expanded, so that heaven can be established on earth.
A Shortcoming in Society is That it Specializes in Exposing People's Shortcomings Pan Gongzhan said: The relief spirit of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society is truly admirable. For the past two or three years, following the mayor, I have discovered many worthy deeds of praise in Shanghai. We must excavate and commend them. There is a shortcoming in society now, that is, it specializes in exposing people's evil, "exposing darkness" has long become a fashionable term. You must know that suppressing evil and promoting good is a traditional virtue of our country. Because individual behavior originates from thought, and thought is imitated, so there must be good models to guide people into the right track. Promoting good lies in setting an example for others. There is one way in the world, which is to save people and benefit others. In Buddhism, there are the three interconnected words of "faith, vow, and action." Faith is believing that this matter is beneficial to the people and the world, vow is setting a will, and action is seeking its realization. The three are connected, and the result is that those who have a will will succeed. The working spirit of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society is worthy of being promoted. The ten directors are all worthy of becoming role models for humanity. Keswick praised the charitable work of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society and said that all the directors of the society were his personal friends, which he was very proud of. Edward spoke in Chinese, saying: Americans and Chinese are very different in doing charitable work. Americans mostly like to promote and show off when doing relief work, while Chinese do it silently. Emergency loan work is worthy of praise, and it is hoped that similar righteous deeds can emerge like a whirlwind.
Many Frozen Corpses on the Streets; A Request for Relief is Attached Fan Zhengbo said that the work of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society is worthy of being recorded by the news media. And incidentally contribute a point of view, recently more and more people have been frozen to death on the streets, and most of them are children. This phenomenon is a great shame for Shanghai. It is hoped that the mayor will take the lead, and philanthropists will cooperate to provide relief. The mayor replied that the authorities have already paid attention. Four mobile collection vehicles are dispatched every night to transport the refugees on the streets to shelters. Recently, a very tragic sight has been discovered in the city, that is, there are many abandoned babies. Every night, they are found. How can newborns withstand the cold? Therefore, I hope that parents who want to abandon their babies, for whatever reason, can hand them over to the Municipal Relief Association for care.

Hot Money Flows In, Price Hikes Become Unstoppable Financial Authorities to Restrict Remittances from Other Areas to Shanghai [Report from Our Newspaper] Price hikes have become unstoppable. Yesterday, white rice exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark, and cotton cloth prices rose by about 40%. Due to the influx of remittances from various regions, the amount of hot money in the market has increased significantly. In addition to the continuous flow from Central and Northern Jiangsu, funds returning from Southern China are no less than 1 billion. Therefore, it is estimated that the amount of hot money in the market is currently close to 2.1 billion. It is only natural that it is stirring up trouble. In order to stabilize the market, financial authorities have begun to restrict remittances from other areas to Shanghai and will continue to sell materials to absorb hot money. However, because the government controls a limited amount of materials, and the power of hot money is endless, a small amount of sales is close to "gift-giving," so only the passive measure of restricting remittances from other areas can be taken.
Production Loan Review Committee Approves Emergency Production Loans [Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discounting Committee for Production and Export Business Loans Review Committee held its seventh meeting yesterday, discussing a total of 46 cases related to emergency industrial loans and finished product purchases for industries such as machinery, electrical machinery, hardware, dyeing and weaving, hat making, rubber, and flour.

Cotton Cloth Prices Rise Astonishingly Prices of Various Cloths Jump by About 40% The cotton cloth market reached a new high. Public utility prices have almost doubled, and prices of all non-cotton items have also risen, causing anxiety. Everyone is taking the opportunity to raise prices, and the prices of various cotton cloths have jumped by about 40%. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 81,000 to 86,000, and finally returned to 83,000 yuan, a huge increase of 24,500 yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 23,500 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon rose by 20,000 yuan, closing at 66,000 yuan.

The price of cotton cloth rose sharply, and speculative transactions were active. Local customers also successively searched for purchases, and holders were unwilling to sell, causing the price of various cloths to jump in a straight line. The leading fine cloth opened at a new high price of 1,930 yuan, and once broke through the 2,000 yuan mark, finally settling at 2,000 yuan, an increase of 460 yuan compared to the previous day.

Four Gentlemen's Yuan Bi Ji was quoted from 1,780 yuan to a low of 1,720 yuan, and reached a high of 1,850 yuan, closing at 1,830 yuan in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 410 yuan.

Adjustment of Import Quotas for Southern China: Transportation Control Committee is Planning It The International Trade Association here believes that with the current economic center shifting south, the government should make necessary adjustments to trade measures. According to Chen Junren, Acting Chairman of the Import and Export Control Committee, regarding imports and exports, a comprehensive assessment is currently being made based on the export costs of each region and the export situation at the end of last year, so that close coordination can be achieved between the regions. The National Bank is also being asked to facilitate the use of funds by exporters so that export figures can be increased. As for whether the exchange rate for export settlements in Wuzhou and Guangzhou should be lower than in Shanghai, it must be studied before a decision can be made. Regarding imports, the import quotas allocated to various ports in Southern China in the past may be insufficient. In the seventh and eighth seasons, the committee approved US$2 million in imports beyond the quotas for Southern China in order to remedy the situation. It is indeed necessary to adjust the import quotas for Southern China, but the current trade is a chain of imports and exports, which should be determined according to the export situation and the needs of the various ports in Southern China. However, the existing industries in Central China, Shanghai, and Northern China must be maintained, and exports should also be assisted in order to fulfill the government's responsibilities. As for import and export visa procedures, efforts will be made to expedite and simplify them.

The afternoon closing was at 83,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 21,000 yuan. The rest generally rose together. Because raw material prices jumped sharply yesterday, costs increased, and the cost of living index in the first ten days of this month also rose with the prices of goods, people were optimistic. The Meiya quilt cover was first opened at a high price of 46,500 yuan, and the Huaqiang was at 46,000 yuan. After the shout, the cotton cloth prices jumped, and buying interest was very strong, and the market price rose again.

Until the close, the Meiya was at 43,500 yuan, and the Huaqiang was at 43,000 yuan, each rising by about 10,000 yuan.
Inventory is Depleted, Sources are Exhausted, Export Goods Will Be Reduced Again According to export industry news, since the beginning of the new year, the export business in the city has not improved. Those in charge of the export industry predict that export materials will be reduced even more in this month than in December last year. The reasons are: (1) The inventory of export materials in the city has been depleted. In order to ensure the safety of materials, exporters have already exported them early in November and December last year. (2) Because the war zone has expanded and transportation is blocked, materials purchased by exporters in the production areas cannot be transported to Shanghai. (3) In recent months, many export companies have moved to Guangzhou and Taiwan. Most of them only have an office in Shanghai, with no business. In the current situation, the future of the export industry in the city is worrying. Export settlement income will also decrease accordingly.

### British Industrial Exhibition Invites Chinese Manufacturers to Participate

According to information from the International Trade Department of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently received a notice from the British National Industrial Exhibition stating that the exhibition is scheduled to be held simultaneously in London and Birmingham from May 2nd to May 13th of this year.

### Public Education Kerosene Allocation Price Issue

Petroleum Company Denies Being Unreasonable

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Petroleum Corporation of the Resources Committee has adjusted the allocation price of kerosene for public and educational personnel in this city for November and December of last year to 279.27 yuan per can. Officials from various institutions have expressed strong dissatisfaction and have jointly submitted a petition to the Public and Educational Personnel Material Supply Committee, requesting a reasonable reduction. According to the China Petroleum Corporation, the approved price of kerosene produced by the company was originally 334.75 yuan per can, which is significantly different from the 400 yuan price set by the three foreign petroleum companies in the city. However, since the raw materials for oil refining of the company and the foreign companies both come from the United States, the business has already suffered considerable losses. Furthermore, unlike other directly-administered institutions, the company does not receive government subsidies and relies entirely on the flexibility of exchange rate differences to maintain operations. There is no profit margin in the selling price. The decision on the allocation price for public and educational personnel should, on the one hand, consider the burden on public and educational personnel as much as possible, and on the other hand, it cannot ignore its own costs. Currently, the kerosene produced by the company in the market has risen to 470 yuan per can. Therefore, it is believed that the allocation price of 279 yuan is not unreasonable.

### Wang Renlin Issues Statement on Air Transportation of Refugees: Aircraft Rental is Decided by Headquarters, Companies' Opinions Will Be Forwarded on Their Behalf.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Far East Bureau of the International Refugee Organization is currently stepping up efforts to repatriate refugees and find ways to resettle them in other countries. The Geneva headquarters is also planning to transport refugees by air in emergency situations. The matter has been entrusted to the American Overseas Airlines to rent aircraft. Six airlines designated in China, including Pan American, Northwest, Air France, British Overseas, KLM Royal Dutch, and China National Aviation Corporation, reportedly had a slight misunderstanding after hearing the news. They believe that American Overseas Airlines did not apply to the Civil Aviation Administration for entry procedures in advance according to international civil transport procedures, and that the six companies in China are fully capable of transporting all refugees, and there is no need to recruit other companies. The Civil Aviation Administration sent Xiao Likun, director of the business department, to Shanghai a few days ago to listen to all parties' opinions and mediate the situation. Wang Renlin, director of the Far East Bureau of the International Refugee Organization, met with reporters yesterday and explained the matter. According to Wang, the Geneva headquarters recently rented three DC4 aircraft from American Overseas Airlines to transport refugees by air in order to speed up the completion of the refugee repatriation and resettlement work and to cope with the emergency situation of insufficient shipping space or the inability to obtain shipping. This was entirely decided by the Geneva headquarters, and the Far East Bureau was only ordered to implement it. It is also learned that the freight rates of American Overseas Airlines were decided after competition among various companies in Geneva, and that the company's flights to the Far East are only an extension of European flights. In addition to considering the freight rates, the International Refugee Organization also gave deep consideration to the efficiency and equipment of various companies. Director Wang expressed his gratitude to the six airlines in China for their willingness to participate in the air transportation of refugees. In addition to sending a letter of thanks, he has also forwarded the opinions of the various companies to the Geneva headquarters for approval. Finally, Wang stated that the number of refugees transported by air is extremely limited and must be used in emergency situations. Currently, refugees are still being transported mainly by ship. The Philippines recently approved the entry of 6,000 refugees, and the Bureau has rented three ships to send them there soon. Moreover, three more ships will carry refugees to Europe for transfer to various parts of Palestine.

### Year-End Bonus Payment Method Does Not Include Subsidies in Principle. Decided at the Second Meeting of the Handling Committee

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Bureau's Year-End Bonus Handling Committee held its second committee meeting at the Social Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday.

(1) Whether the payment of year-end bonuses should include other subsidies for joint payment. The resolution was that year-end bonuses should not include subsidies in principle, but industries with customary practices should still follow their customs. If there are no past customs to follow, the Social Bureau may handle disputes by considering the nature of the subsidies and the employer's ability to bear them. (2) Approved the year-end bonus payment method for temporary workers promoted to formal workers. It is stipulated that temporary workers who are promoted to formal workers within the statutory period should have their year-end bonus calculated proportionally from the time of their promotion to formal workers. The portion of their temporary employment period exceeding the statutory period should be included in the formal workers' service years for calculation, but only for this year. If there are past agreements, they should still follow their agreements.
