### New Cabinet Formation: Assembly Tomorrow; Peace Negotiation Issues to be Discussed; Current Foreign Policy Unlikely to Change

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The He cabinet, which has been under formation for a week, was declared complete on the 21st and, after being unanimously approved by the Kuomintang's Central Political Committee and Standing Committee in Nanjing, was appointed and announced by the Acting President. The entire cabinet consists of: one Deputy Premier, eight Ministers, two Heads of Commissions, and seven Political Councilors, totaling eighteen individuals. Except for the positions reserved for one member each from the People's and Youth Parties, the remaining sixteen individuals have been announced. Overall, among the sixteen names, nine are new appointments, and seven are reappointments, indicating a significant improvement compared to the past practice of reorganizing cabinets with mere superficial changes. However, among the newly appointed, very few lack previous administrative experience. For example, Jia Jingde, Zhang Zhiben, Li Hanhun, Duanmu Jie, He Yaozu, Mo Dehui, Hang Liwu, and others are merely being transferred in a carousel-like fashion. Only Liu Gongyun and Chuan Bingchang are truly new faces. Nevertheless, observing the overall lineup, the absence of the CC Clique demonstrates a positive aspect. However, the new cabinet evidently lacks new politicians with a bold and decisive style. Therefore, in terms of governance style, the He cabinet lineup appears to be somewhat weak. This list was submitted by He at 2:00 AM on the 21st to Acting President Li, who approved it. At 4:00 AM, at the Presidential Palace, Acting President Li invited the KMT Central Standing Committee members and Central Political Committee members to a discussion. Acting President Li and Premier He explained the process of forming the cabinet and introduced the list of cabinet members. By 5:30 AM, they had obtained full support and agreement from all attendees, and the President immediately appointed them, announcing it that evening.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a meeting at 8:00 PM on the 21st at the Central Party Headquarters on Nan Di. Attendees included Wu Tiecheng, Tian Kunshan, Zou Lu, Li Wenfan, Xiao Tongzi, Zheng Yanfen, Gu Zhengding, Liu Wendao, Di Ying, Yao Dahai, Chen Qingyun, Hu Yiguan, and LÃ¼ Xiaodao. Zou Lu was elected chairman. After passing the motion to appoint Comrade Jia Jingde as the Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan, the meeting adjourned.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The new cabinet will be sworn in within three days and will hold its first political affairs meeting to discuss the most pressing issues of the moment. It is reported that the peace negotiation issue will be the primary topic of discussion, especially regarding the fact that the current peace negotiation representatives are only Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong. The selection of additional representatives and the content of the peace talks will be discussed for the first time on the 23rd.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The appointment of Chuan Bingchang as Foreign Minister, with the consent of a majority of individuals within the Kuomintang, is indeed a novel manifestation of the new cabinet's style. However, whether Chuan's appointment as Foreign Minister while concurrently serving as the current Ambassador to the Soviet Union indicates a change in the current diplomatic policy is a matter of great concern to political figures. When this reporter inquired about the comments of several individuals on this matter, the majority, not knowing He's political views, declined to comment. Only one authoritative figure believed that it would not affect our current foreign policy, nor would it provoke any significant change in relations with the Soviet Union, as the Soviet attitude towards us is very clear and will not be drastically altered by this. As for the Soviet aid issue that some are worried about, this authoritative figure said: "The hope for Soviet aid was originally very slim."

Attached: Revised Articles 3 and 5 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law

Article 3: The following Ministries and Commissions are established under the Executive Yuan: (1) Ministry of Interior, (2) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (3) Ministry of National Defense, (4) Ministry of Finance, (5) Ministry of Education, (6) Ministry of Judicial Administration, (7) Ministry of Economic Affairs, (8) Ministry of Transportation, (9) Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, (10) Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The organization of each Ministry and Commission shall be determined by law.

Article 5: The Executive Yuan shall establish an Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the organization of which shall be determined by separate law.

### Executive Yuan to Study Setting Up Propaganda Department

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] After the Legislative Yuan decided to abolish the Executive Yuan Information Office, the new He Yingqin cabinet no longer has an organization to oversee the office's considerable responsibilities. Several units are also located abroad. Since the organization no longer exists, the funding has naturally become a problem. He originally invited Bao Jingan, the former director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Army Headquarters, to serve as the Director of the Information Office. During the period when He was forming the cabinet, Bao assisted as He's spokesperson. It is now learned that He is studying the possibility of establishing a news and propaganda department within the Executive Yuan. Its organization will be much smaller than the Information Office, so as to handle the Information Office's business with the fewest personnel. Bao will still be asked to preside over it. However, since it concerns the organization of the Executive Yuan, it is necessary to amend the Executive Yuan Organization Law, which has not yet been decided.

### Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Replaces the Ministry; Pang Songzhou Reappointed as Director-General

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Ministry of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has been changed to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, directly under the Executive Yuan. Pang Songzhou will continue to serve as the Director-General. The appointment was announced by ministerial order on the 21st.

### Will the Democratic Socialist Party Join the Cabinet? Final Decision to be Made Today; No Key Members of the Youth Party in Nanjing

[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party will convene a Central Standing Committee meeting at 9:00 AM this morning, personally presided over by Zhang Junmai, to make a final decision on the issue of participating in the new cabinet. As for the attitude of the Youth Party, according to the party spokesperson, after expressing their attitude on the 18th of this month, party Standing Committee member Wang Lanseng immediately took Li Huang's letter to Nanjing to personally present it to General He Yingqin. The letter earnestly explained the Youth Party's sincerity in supporting the He cabinet, but stated that under the current situation, not participating in the cabinet would be more helpful to the He cabinet. Wang returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. There are no key members of the Youth Party in Nanjing. The rumors that the party will take a position as a political councilor in the new cabinet are indeed inaccurate.

### Acting President Li Hosts Dinner for Indian Ambassador

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Acting President Li hosted a dinner at the Presidential Palace at 7:00 PM on the 21st for the Indian Ambassador and his wife, son, and Yu Hanmou, Zhang Fakui, and others.

### Supervisors Conduct Preliminary Investigation into Raising the Price of Silver Dollars; Tang Honglie and Others Arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the case of the National Bank raising the price of silver dollars, which stimulated price increases, the Control Yuan appointed three supervisors, Hu Wenhui, Tang Honglie, and He Jizhou, to conduct an investigation. Hu and He visited Wu Xingzhou, the director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, on the morning of the 21st to conduct a preliminary inquiry and review the case files. The two intended to visit Liu Gongyun, but Liu returned to Shanghai by overnight train on the 20th. According to Hu Wenhui and Tang Honglie's report at the Control Yuan on the morning of the 21st, today was only a preliminary investigation, and they will need to go to Shanghai in the coming days to conduct a more thorough investigation. However, according to the preliminary investigation results on the 21st, it has already been proven that this approach is not only unhelpful to the national economy and the people's livelihood but is actually a "penny-wise, pound-foolish" move. Tang and Hu went to Shanghai on the night of the 21st.

### Vacancies for Grand Justice and Examination Committee Member; Acting President to Nominate Within the Week

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The process of filling the long-vacant positions of Grand Justice and Examination Committee Member has been finally set in motion. Acting President Li will submit nominations within the week to the Control Yuan for approval. During the Control Yuan meeting on the morning of the 21st, it was decided that President Yu Youren should personally present the matter to Acting President Li and request that nominations be made promptly. Before making nominations, the consent of the nominees should be obtained first to avoid the situation where the Control Yuan approves the nomination, but the nominee still refuses to take office. There are a total of seventeen Grand Justices, of which the Control Yuan has previously approved twelve. There are a total of nineteen Examination Committee Members, of which the Control Yuan has previously approved ten.

### The Road to Peace Negotiations is Long and Uncertain; Dr. Yen Predicts Eventual Understanding

[Our Dispatch] Yen Huiqing stated yesterday: The prospects for the Kuomintang-Communist peace negotiations are indeed long and uncertain. Before April, the peace negotiations are unlikely to begin because the government's peace negotiation representatives have not yet been determined. The candidates for representatives from both sides may be announced at the same time in the future. Dr. Yen predicted that the peace negotiations may drag on for one or two months without achieving anything. However, because both sides have a need for peace, an understanding will eventually be reached. Yen said: Because of my age and physical weakness, I am unwilling to serve as an official representative, but if there are twists and turns in the peace negotiations, I am still willing to mediate. Yen analyzed the process of the peace negotiations, saying that first, a basis for negotiation must be found, and then the relevant political, economic, and military issues must be resolved in turn. Among them, the issue of disarmament is the most complicated and difficult and should be handled by a small military committee.

### A Key Figure in the Lan Ni Case; Zhang Zhaoyuan Answers Questions at the Control Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the case of returning Yanliao to Lan Ni, after the former Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Property provided an explanation on this case, the original supervisors in the case, Xiong Zaiwei and Jin Yueguang, because they did not know Zhang Zhaoyuan's current address, could not deliver the official documents. They published a notice in the newspaper, instructing him to bring the relevant case files and personally attend a conversation at 11:00 AM on the 21st. Zhang arrived at the Control Yuan on time, and supervisors Xiong and Jin questioned him in detail on the Committee's handling of the case. The record of their conversation is as follows:

Q: Mr. Zhang, from which meeting did you start participating in the Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Property?

A: From the 22nd meeting. The Lan case was an item for discussion. The 22nd meeting discussed Lan Yezhen's request to return 84 barrels of Indanthrene dyes in order to protect property rights. The resolution was to approve the return. If it could not be paid with goods of the same type and quality, it should be returned at the market price. When this case was passed, only Ye Gongchao's representative made a reservation on the spot.

Q: Please provide all the files for review.

A: These files are in the seventh group of the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan. I resigned on March 5th. Please have your esteemed court directly review the files.

Q: Were there any meetings held after the 22nd meeting?

A: Two meetings were held after that. The 24th meeting was held in Guangzhou, which I did not attend. It was presided over by Minister Zhao Chen.

Q: In what way was the Lan case brought up at the 22nd meeting?

A: It was brought up in writing.

Q: How did the Lan case proceed during the 22nd meeting?

A: The number of attendees at the 22nd meeting, including the chairman, was 16. Except for Ye Gongchao's representative, Zhang Tingzheng, who made a statement reserving his opinion, there were no other objections.

Q: What is the basis for Lan Yezhen's ownership?

A: Lan Yezhen has a receipt, but I have not seen it.

Q: Did Le Runting's testimony explain that the warehouse receipt belonged to Lan Yezhen?

A: I can't remember.

Q: The dyes that Le Runting applied to return were vulcanized indigo, while the dyes that Lan Ni applied to return were Indanthrene indigo. The quality is different, and the price is different. Was this not studied?

A: These dyes are of the same type, only the brand is different. Because it was based on the description on the warehouse receipt, this issue was not studied.

Q: Le Runting stated that he was the sole proprietor of the dyes and had people prove that he was the sole proprietor. There were no other names on the warehouse receipt. Did the Committee study this?

A: I remember that the file contained opinions stating that according to the customs of Shanghai merchants, an agent could come forward.

Q: Did the agent state who he was an agent for? Also, the warehouse receipt was paid by Le Runting, and Lan Yezhen has already applied for it. Has this been studied?

A: At the meeting, many committee members arrived temporarily. In fact, it was not deeply studied, only based on the annotations of the person in charge.

Q: Mr. Zhang, do you have any other comments?

A: (1) According to merchant customs, the warehouse receipt does not necessarily have to be in my name; (2) The Clearing Office said that Lan Yezhen also had a receipt, but I have not seen the receipt; (3) Lan Yezhen submitted a witness to the Clearing Office.

Q: After Lan Yezhen submitted the witness, how did the Executive Yuan instruct?

A: The Executive Yuan believed that the witness was sufficient and then transferred the case to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for interpretation.

Q: What was the opinion of the Ministry of Judicial Administration?

A: The Ministry of Judicial Administration believed that Lan Yezhen's request for return was not without basis and could be studied again by the handling agency.

Q: After Lan submitted the witness, did the Executive Yuan submit new evidence to the Clearing Office after it believed that it was insufficient?

A: I can't remember clearly and need to check the case file.

Q: What explanation did the Ministry of Judicial Administration make on this?

A: The Ministry of Judicial Administration explained that the government should have the burden of proof for confiscating enemy and puppet property. This is a general principle. As for Lan Yezhen and Le Runting, it is another matter.

Q: Reports say that after this court's investigation, it notified the China Trust Bureau to stop payment. When was that official letter sent?

A: I notified the China Trust Bureau by phone to stop payment and did not approve Lan An Yezhen.

Signatures: Xiong Zaiwei, Jin Yueguang, Zhang Zhaoyuan.

### Impeachment of Sun Ke; Documents Sent to the Presidential Palace and the High Prosecutor's Office

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The case of former Premier of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke misappropriating 110 million yuan of national funds in the name of "confidential expenses" has been investigated and verified by supervisors Yu Peihou and Ni Bi, who have filed an impeachment. After review and establishment, the impeachment document has been sent by the Control Yuan to the Presidential Palace and the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office on the morning of the 21st to prosecute according to law and recover the funds that have already been spent (the full text of the impeachment document has been published in the first edition of this newspaper on the 19th).

### Control Yuan Reviews Politics; Supervisors Express Deep Concerns about Reform Issues

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Control Yuan held its 42nd meeting on the morning of the 20th, chaired by Yu Youren, to broadly review politics. Supervisors spoke enthusiastically and expressed deep concerns about the current issues of political reform. Cao Dexuan, Yu Zhenzhou, Liu Pingjiang, Qiu Niantai, and others all advocated for new policies, new personnel, strict punishment of corruption, strict enforcement of the rule of law, respect for the power of supervision, and reduction of agencies. Ye Duoxiu, Zhang Dinghua, Wang Guanwu, Lu Fengge, Cao Dexuan, and others provided many opinions on military issues. They all believed that the size of the Ministry of National Defense's organization, the phenomenon of phantom soldiers in the army, the corruption of military discipline, and the low treatment of soldiers should be corrected. Wang Xiangchen also pointed out that the only issue in the military is the issue of troop consolidation. If the troops cannot be consolidated, and units of over 100,000 men continue to report 500,000, not only will there be no way to solve the financial problems, the treatment of the troops cannot be improved, and nothing else can be discussed. The afternoon continued with the review. Supervisors spoke on fiscal, economic, and border issues. They strongly criticized inflation, high-interest loans, and banning commercial practices. The meeting adjourned at 5:40 PM.

### Jiangbei Still Maintains Original Positions; Communist Army Still Incapable of Crossing the River; Military Official Analyzes Military Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the reports in the Nanjing and Shanghai newspapers of the 21st that "the Communist army in Jiangbei has completed preparations to cross the river," this reporter inquired with a senior military official here. According to him: Chen Yi's troops suffered heavy losses after the Xuzhou campaign. In the past two months, it can be said that they have completed the replenishment of troops, but it is obviously inconsistent with the facts to say that they have completed preparations to cross the river. The Jiangbei area is entirely a region of lakes and swamps, with crisscrossing rivers and streams. The original highways and bridges are mostly dilapidated and cannot be completed in a short period of time. Before the completion of this project, the Communist army cannot use its heavy artillery units. If the heavy artillery units cannot be used, they will not be able to suppress the Nationalist naval vessels moving on the river and carry out their plan to land in front of the enemy. This is one reason. The 18 armies of Chen Yi, totaling more than 400,000 men, need ammunition and supplies for the river-crossing offensive. With the current transportation lines in Jiangbei and the Communist army's transportation capabilities, who would believe that they have completed preparations? This is the second reason. More importantly, regarding the preparation of river-crossing tools such as ships, the investigation reports from all parties have not yet reached the completion stage. This is the third reason. As for the claim that they have completed preparations for attacking the bridgeheads in Jiangbei, this is still possible. However, before the official breakdown of peace negotiations, the Communist army may not do this. This is why the Communist army in Jiangbei has only been conducting probing attacks in recent days and has not launched a full-scale offensive. Furthermore, the Nationalist army has maintained all of its original positions.

### Zhang Xueliang is Not Dead

[Associated Press, Taipei, 21st] Local authorities stated on the 21st that the rumors that Zhang Xueliang is dead are "completely unfounded."

### Chongqing Warship Has Capsized; Air Force Squadrons Successfully Complete Mission; Ministry of National Defense to Announce Investigation into Mutiny Case

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Since the Chongqing warship mutiny incident occurred, the Ministry of National Defense has specially dispatched officials to Nanjing and Shanghai to investigate the matter. It is learned that the results have been obtained and will be announced soon.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the Chongqing warship mutiny case, the Control Yuan has appointed Cao Dexuan and Lu Fengge to conduct an investigation. Cao and Lu are scheduled to visit Gui Yongqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, at the Naval Headquarters on the afternoon of the 22nd to conduct inquiries.

### Commander Who Led the Team; Commander Chen Jiashang; Flew to Nanjing from Qingdao Yesterday to Report on the Process

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 21st] Commander Chen Jiashang of the Second Air Force Region, who personally led the team to direct the bombing of the Chongqing warship, flew to Nanjing from here at 9:00 AM on the 21st to report that the mission of punishing the mutinous warship had come to an end. A few minutes before departing, he spoke to this newspaper's correspondent from the headquarters forty miles away via military telephone. He said that after the final reconnaissance, the warship had mostly sunk and the bottom of the ship had already turned over. His tone was very decisive and excited.

[Our Dispatch] After the continuous and fierce bombing of the mutinous Chongqing warship by the air force for two days, as of the morning of the 20th, it has rapidly sunk. According to the air force reconnaissance report on the 20th, the bombing was concentrated on the stern of the ship, and the bombs that hit totaled 8,000 pounds. On the evening of the 19th, the ship was seen to be tilting to the right and gradually sinking. On the 20th, it was discovered that two-thirds of the left side of the ship was facing the sky, and the deck and command tower were submerged in the sea. There was still thick black smoke rising from the stern of the ship. According to the air force's judgment, because the depth of Huludao harbor is not high, the current state of the Chongqing warship capsizing has probably reached its peak, and complete submersion is practically impossible. However, with the equipment of all the excellent ports in the Far East, including Lushun and Dalian, there is no way to lift the ship out of the water, tow it elsewhere, or repair the damaged parts. In the future, the use of part of the Huludao harbor docks will be difficult to restore for several years due to the sinking of the ship. The Air Force now believes that the function of the mutinous Chongqing warship has been completely lost, so the bombing mission was completely terminated on the 20th. The armor on the stern of the Chongqing warship is three inches thick, and its anti-aircraft firepower is extremely high. Foreigners here were surprised that our air force was able to successfully complete the bombing mission in two days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] It is learned that about 20 people were killed and more than 80 were injured on the Chongqing warship. The rest mostly landed ashore. After the news of the ship's mutiny was confirmed, Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing reported to the Ministry of National Defense and requested punishment himself.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] It is reported that after the Chongqing warship was bombed and the oil depot, stern, and many other places on the ship caught fire on the 19th, the 20th Air Force B-24S aircraft, in four batches, led by Lieutenant Colonel Shui Jianpan, flew north over Huludao and discovered that the ship's body had already tilted. They immediately continued to drop 1,000-pound giant bombs, all of which hit the ship. Among them, the fourth batch of B-24 aircraft that entered to drop bombs caused great damage to the broken ship with two out of four bombs directly hitting it. When the last batch flew south from Huludao, they discovered that the ship had already turned over from tilting, with the bottom of the ship facing the sky. At this point, the fate of the Chongqing was completely destroyed.

(The reasons for the mutiny of the Chongqing warship and the detailed process of the Air Force's bombing reconnaissance and meritorious personnel are published on the second page)

### Editorial: Thoughts on the Pacific Pact

Following the public announcement of the contents of the Atlantic Pact, opinions in various countries have differed greatly, but all countries in the Far East hope that the United States will take the initiative to organize a Pacific alliance similar to the Atlantic Pact, especially as expressed in the remarks of Philippine President Quirino. Mr. Quirino frankly stated: "The United States should not concentrate all its attention on Europe but should take a leading role in the Far East, first initiating the formation of a Pacific alliance similar to the Atlantic Pact, to combat Communism in the Far East. If the United States abandons us, it will lose its vast potential in the Far East. Europe has its economic value, but Asia is also a virgin land with unlimited resources, and the United States should not disappoint us in the East." Therefore, his conclusion is: "The Pacific Pact is feasible, and there is no reason to oppose it. On the contrary, there are many benefits."

President Quirino's ardent desire for a Pacific Pact is evident in his words. In fact, in today's turbulent Far East Pacific region, who does not hope for a regional security mechanism? When commenting on the Atlantic Pact, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wellington Koo, also frankly stated: "The conclusion of the Atlantic Pact is a valuable achievement for peace and security, and the collective security ideal of the United Nations Charter has been partially realized. Unfortunately, this pact only includes one side of the world peace front. If world peace is to be effectively guaranteed, the other side of the peace front, Asia, should also have a similar organization to prevent aggression." Although Ambassador Koo did not directly mention the Pacific Pact, his desire for its early conclusion is no less than that of the Philippine President.

Rumors of negotiating a Pacific Pact have been circulating for a long time. The main reason is that all countries in Southeast Asia feel threatened by the strength of Communism and must jointly seek ways to defend themselves against Communism to ensure local security and peace in the Far East Pacific region. Since the rise of the Chinese Communist Party, the power of Asian Communist parties has invaded southward, day by day. Whether it is Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaya, Siam, or Burma, even Australia, the Philippines, and India have felt the threat of Communism. In early March, Indian Prime Minister Nehru initiated the Southeast Asian Dominion Conference, ostensibly for the internal strife in Burma, but in reality, was it not for regional security in Southeast Asia? At the same time, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, for the sake of his own sense of security, also strongly advocated that Southeast Asia should establish an organization similar to the Western European Union to resist foreign aggression. He volunteered to say that since Britain is busy with European affairs and has no time to take care of them, Australia is willing to step forward and guide the Southeast Asian Dominions to defend themselves against Communism. In fact, we have had such predictions for a year, but unfortunately, very few contemporary statesmen with foresight can do what it takes to turn the tide. As a result, today's situation has been created. Only when the overall situation in China is shaken do people feel the anxiety in Southeast Asia and the dangerous situation in the Pacific, but it is almost too late.

The preparation of the Pacific Pact seems to have been going on for several months. Most recently, when British Cabinet Special Envoy Listowel visited Canberra to discuss Pacific defense with the Australian Cabinet, this rumor became even more concrete. Australian Defense Minister Dedman also clearly announced in Parliament: "Under the initiative of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, countries in the Pacific region have already begun discussions to establish a Pacific Pact similar to the Atlantic Pact, to prevent the expansion of Communism and facilitate reconstruction work." However, because the British Foreign Office insisted on its own views, the Pacific Pact could not be negotiated until after the Atlantic Pact was completed, so the Pacific Pact was shelved again. Now, the content of the Atlantic Pact has been announced and is scheduled to be signed in Washington on April 4th, which can be regarded as the completion of the Atlantic Pact. In terms of procedure, negotiations on the Pacific Pact can begin. Moreover, the Pacific countries have been encouraged by the Atlantic Pact and are even more eager for the Pacific Pact to be realized as soon as possible. Looking at the trend, the negotiation of the Pacific Pact may have the momentum of "when the water comes, the canal is formed." According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on the 19th, the United States is quite interested in the suggestions of Mr. Quirino, and the British side will also express its approval. Prospects for diplomatic activities are about to officially begin.

Standing in the position of a third party, we would like to put forward several prerequisites for the conclusion of the Pacific Pact: First, the US policy of emphasizing Europe and underemphasizing Asia should be changed immediately, and the focus of its diplomatic activities should be quickly shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But we see that the United States still hopes that Britain will take more responsibility in the Far East, which shows that the United States has no intention of changing its policy. If the United States is unwilling to take a leading role in the Far East and only knows how to vigorously promote the Pacific Pact, even if the Pacific Pact is concluded in the future, its meaning will be greatly reduced, or it may even lead to unexpected adverse consequences. Second, the United Kingdom's view of the Pacific Pact still focuses on the security of its Southeast Asian Dominions, and there is no long-term plan for the entire Asia. In particular, its attitude towards the Chinese Communist Party is fundamentally contradictory to its attempt to promote the Pacific Pact. Third, China is the only stabilizing force in the Pacific. Any regional security mechanism, whether it is the Pacific Pact or the Southeast Asian League, will not have much effect if China is not included in it. Therefore, any arrangements made by the United Kingdom in Asia must first find a way to stabilize the situation in China and prevent the entire China from being ruled and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party alone, thereby causing the entire Asian continent to fall into the Soviet Iron Curtain. If this prerequisite cannot be achieved, all other plans are in vain. Fourth, Indian Prime Minister Nehru does not seem very enthusiastic about the Pacific Pact and has already expressed his opposition. We have studied Nehru's intentions and believe that Nehru's opinions are very worthy of attention by the United Kingdom and the United States. It must be known that today's era is the Asian century, and Asian countries must not be treated with the past perspective of colonies. If the United Kingdom and the United States can prove with facts that Nehru's concerns are unnecessary, then India and Pakistan will also be happy to join the Pacific Pact.

### Streamlining of the Legislative Yuan's Organization; Amendments to Organizational Laws Underway; General Assembly Today to Review Adjustments to Postal, Telecommunications, and Railway Rates and Fares

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The work of streamlining the Legislative Yuan's own organization has begun. The Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM on the 21st to exchange preliminary views on amending the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law and the Organizational Laws of various committees. The members generally believed that the business of the original 21 committees could be simplified and merged into 11 committees. It was decided to invite all committee members at 9:00 AM on the 23rd to exchange views, and then convene a review meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to amend the organizational law.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The seventh meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 22nd to review the methods for adjusting railway, postal, and telecommunications rates and fares according to the cost index, as well as the first draft of the political reform outline drafted by the Legislative Yuan, which have all been included in the agenda.

It was decided to nominate Yang Baodong, Niu Jianchu, Shao Jingren, Yang Buping, Mao Yihu, Li Gongquan, Yue Shuyou, and other seven people to consult the Ministry of Food for opinions and be responsible for drafting reform measures, with Yang Baodong as the convener, and it was decided to convene another joint review at 3:00 PM on the 23rd.

### Committee to Aid China Issues Statement; US Can Still Effectively Aid China; Military and Economic Aid Should Be Provided Quickly

[United Press, Washington, 20th] The newly established Committee to Aid China issued a statement today, strongly arguing that the United States can still effectively aid China in its anti-communist war, as long as it promptly provides military and economic aid, along with moral support. Committee Chairman McKee said that the purpose of the new committee is to list the current situation in China and its impact on the United States to the American people. As long as the US government issues a clear promise to aid anti-communism, it can give China great moral support. Mr. McKee proposed: 1. Give economic aid, including loans charged with tariff revenue; 2. Send a military delegation to China, with the same nature as the US military delegation to Greece; 3. Provide military supplies, such as light equipment, small arms, and ammunition.

### Conditions Differ in Eastern Countries; Communists Do Not Follow the Soviet Union?; Remarks by Nozaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Nozaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, told a United Press reporter today: The Chinese Communist Party will not take the Yangtze River as the boundary and will eventually control the entire country. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the CCP is completely united. Rumors that its policies are inconsistent with those of Li Lisan and others are not true. The first thing the CCP wants is to establish a democratic government, which is the hope of realistic nationalists. The CCP and the JCP cannot replicate Soviet communism because their national conditions are not suitable. Therefore, they can only abide by their own routes and do not need to follow Moscow. The JCP does not need to contact the CCP or other communist parties in the East, nor does it intend to do so. The Eastern Communist International Intelligence Week, there is no such organization now, nor is there a need for it. Because Eastern issues are different in each country, and Asian issues are also very different from European issues. The JCP has learned some skills from Mao Zedong and other CCP leaders, but the JCP and other Eastern communist parties do not regard Mao as the central ideological figure in Asia.

### CCP Lacks Technical Personnel; Factories Managed by Employees

[Our Newspaper News] According to a broadcast from the CCP radio station, the Tianjin CCP Bureau is now adopting a method of direct management by employees for state-owned factories and enterprises taken over from the government. It is reported that the CCP adopted this method because of the lack of various technical personnel and to induce the original workers to cooperate with the Communist Party. According to the CCP, the Military Control Commission has approved employees to implement "democratic management" and the original salary system, "without disrupting the original enterprise organization, thereby stabilizing the employees' morale and completing the complete takeover" to achieve the goal of restoring production. It is claimed that the CCP firmly stated that "Kuomintang special agents and certain pseudo-trade union directors, employees, foremen, and guards who oppress workers and rape female workers and still do not repent must be eliminated" as a condition for exchange. At the same time, the "unreasonable system" in terms of wages, material resources, personnel, systems, and organization during the government era must also be reformed. The Tianjin Railway Bureau convened a conference of employee representatives from all its factories, sections, and stations to discuss this matter. In addition, the Public Bus Management Office, the factories of the China Textile Company, and the Pingjin Clothing Factory also experienced the same situation.

### The Tibetan Government Covets Xikang; If the National Army Weakens Its Defense in Xikang, the Future Is Worrying

An Intelligence Officer Who Lived in Tibet for Eight Years Talks After Returning to Shanghai

[United Press, This City] Reliable sources said on the 21st that if the government's military strength in Xikang is further weakened, the Tibetan government is preparing to enter Xikang Province to take over. A Chinese intelligence officer who had lived in Tibet for eight years recently came to Shanghai. He said: If Liu Wenhui further weakens the defense of Xikang, the Tibetan government, with the assistance of the Tusi in Xikang, will quickly occupy Xikang and place it under direct control. He said: Liu is at odds with Wang Lingji, Chairman of Sichuan, and is no longer interested in Xikang, which has a small population and scarce resources. The Tusi of Xikang will sincerely welcome the entry of a total of 150,000 Tibetan troops who share the same religion with them. He said: "The Tibetan government is currently ruled by the 15-year-old Dalai Lama, but in fact it is ruled by the Dalai Lama's teacher, but he is now 70 years old and it is difficult to manage major affairs, so the real power is in the hands of the four major families. Because of their education and personal interests, they tend to be more pro-British than pro-Chinese. The Chinese government only has a branch of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in Tibet, which is responsible for everything from education to diplomacy. There is no branch of the Central Bank in Tibet, and all remittances and transactions are handled by Indian banks. The Tibetan currency system is linked to the British pound sterling group, so the economic situation is more stable than in other parts of China." It is also known that although Tibet is recognized by all countries in the world (including Britain) as part of China, the passport of the Tibetan trade delegation that visited Europe and the United States last year was not obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese government, but from the British government in Hong Kong.

### Reasons for the Mutiny of the Chongqing Warship; Air Force Bombing and Recognition of Contributing Personnel

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The most deadly bomb that destroyed the Chongqing warship was dropped on the 18th by bombadier Wen Guangqin from the aircraft. This bomb severely damaged the ship, rendering it immobile. The B-24 aircraft carrying the bombardier on this mission was piloted by Major Yang Yongtao. More aircraft went on missions on the 19th, and all the bombs dropped exploded on the ship, with the furthest being within 50 meters of the ship. On this day, Wen Guangqin again dropped a fatal bomb from Yang Yongtao's plane, hitting the ship's tail oil depot, causing the entire ship to catch fire. On the 19th, other planes piloted by Huang Feida, Wang Taiyun, and Li Jianlun also hit the ship with bombs, while Wang Yongxi and Ji Ren, through bombing, hit parts of the ship's surface. These two groups of crew members, totaling six people, have been identified as figures who made special contributions. During the three days of bombing, the anti-aircraft fire was very intense on the 18th and 19th, and the height of the shells exceeded the position of the aircraft. As a result, the oil pipe of the third engine of the plane piloted by Wang Dingji was broken by shrapnel, which hindered flight, but Wang Dingji still managed to fly the plane back and safely land at the base. Others, such as Liu Xirui and Hou Yuan, went to bomb for three days, and pilots such as Jin Zhineng, Yu Keying, and Song Tianxin all calmly went back and forth, accomplishing their missions. It was truly the most successful group action of the squadron. In this battle to bomb the Chongqing, the B-25 aircraft of the Ninth Squadron also flew to participate in the bombing. When the C-47 transport plane went to scout for the first time, it was heavily attacked by ground artillery fire. The pilots Jiang Fukao and Wang Jindu were captivated by the scenery above Huludao, and their flight was so low and close to the Chongqing before returning. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Although the reasons for the betrayal of the Chongqing warship are very complex, according to insiders familiar with the navy, the main reasons are nothing more than: (1) As everyone knows, the salaries of officers and soldiers are too low, and the life of the officers and soldiers of the ship during their internship in England is worlds apart from their life after returning home. (2) Among the officers and soldiers of the navy, there are always divisions of the Mawei faction, the Beiyang faction, and the Qingdao faction, and the internal struggles are extremely fierce. When Chen Shaokuan was in charge of the Naval Headquarters, the naval orders were almost all monopolized by the people of the Mawei faction. After Gui Yongqing took office, he broke this regional concept in many ways, which was dissatisfactory to the people of the Fujian faction. Deng Zhaoxiang, the former captain of the Chongqing warship, belonged to the Mawei faction, while the new captain (probationary captain) Lu Dongge (from Hebei) belonged to the Beiyang faction. When the Naval Headquarters announced Lu's succession to Deng as the captain of the Chongqing warship, it was met with dissatisfaction from Deng and some Mawei faction figures on the ship. Therefore, the departure of the Chongqing warship, with personnel friction, should be its most important factor. (3) Up to now, the materials obtained by the relevant parties indicate that there were only four or five communist agents lurking on the ship who were engaged in instigating betrayal before the ship's departure. The judgment is that these few people were able to force the ship to sail north by taking advantage of Captain Deng's knowledge that he was being transferred and his dissatisfaction with the Naval Headquarters, inciting Deng to issue a false order and sail north directly. After all, the captain is the highest person in charge of a ship, and all orders must be obeyed unconditionally. According to the relevant parties, the new captain Lu Dongge had been credited for his command of a naval unit in the battles of Yingkou and Huludao in the past. When the Naval Headquarters learned that the ship had sailed north on its own and had not sailed towards Taiwan, it still believed that it might be Captain Deng who had sailed the ship north, telling Probationary Captain Lu to "learn by doing." Later, after the Naval Headquarters ordered Captain Deng to sail south by radio and he did not comply, it became aware of the mutiny.

### United Nations General Assembly Scheduled to Open on the Fifth of Next Month; Focus of Diplomatic Battle Shifts to New York; Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky May Personally Lead Delegation to Attend; Three Western Powers to Discuss German Issue

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] The foreign ministers of the countries participating in the Atlantic Pact will gather in Washington around April 1. This meeting will be the last meeting before the signing of the pact on April 4, aimed at discussing practical plans to implement the pact as soon as possible and effectively. According to political circles here, Bevin, Schuman, and Acheson will also discuss the German issue, especially the two issues of reparations and the constitution of the West German Federation.

[United Press, Lake Success, 21st] According to a senior United Nations official, we can guess that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and his first assistant Gromyko will come here next month to attend the United Nations General Assembly, which opens on April 5, and lead the Soviet delegation to fight on the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Soviet Union has not yet notified the United Nations of the lower-level members of the delegation, and has always not notified them until after the delegation has set off. Vyshinsky seized the opportunity last autumn. Vyshinsky is an experienced debater. When the General Assembly discusses the former Italian colonies, the Soviet delegation will take the opportunity to mention the entire policy of the United States in the Mediterranean, and then turn to the North Atlantic Treaty. The Dingfang countries will also be represented by senior personnel. The General Assembly has received notification that French Foreign Minister Schuman will attend in person. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will be in the United States at that time, or he may also attend. Romanin, the former Soviet Consul General in New York and Gromyko's friend, may also come with him. Romanin was ordered to leave the country in August last year due to the Soviet elementary school teacher jumping out of the window. There has been no news of him since then, until last week. He appeared at Vyshinsky's reception in Moscow as the acting director of the news agency. Romanin had attended the United Nations Freedom of Information Committee. Although the United States was unwilling to accept him as the Consul General, Romanin could still attend the General Assembly session as a representative.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 21st] Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Popovic and Metz left here for the United States to attend the third session of the United Nations General Assembly.

### The Western Districts of Berlin Unify the Currency System; The Soviet Union Adopts Countermeasures; Stricter Blockade Fails to Stop Large Amounts of Deutschmark from Entering

[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] Marshal Sokolovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, ordered a strict blockade around the western districts of Berlin this morning to prevent residents of West Berlin from transporting large amounts of East German Marks, which had been discontinued in the Ding district, into the eastern district. However, a large amount still slipped in, and people were rushing to buy goods in the eastern district stores.

He thinks that the Soviet side cannot take more cruel retaliatory actions for the time being.

### Deliberately Overthrowing Tito's Regime; The Soviet Union Adopts a Policy of Division; Large Troop Movements on the Southern Border are Said to Be Psychological Warfare

[United Press, London, 20th] The British Balkans are skeptical of reports of troop movements in Yugoslavia's neighboring countries, believing it to be "psychological warfare." They believe that the Kremlin will launch an anti-Tito movement within Yugoslavia.

Communist International leaders have never recognized Yugoslavia as a simple country in normal events. Yugoslavia is expected to eventually split into different ethnic countries, such as Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, and Montenegro. From the end of the war until the Stalin-Tito conflict began, the key to the Soviet Union's policy was to form a federal Yugoslav state. The main storm within Yugoslavia in the future will be (1) Macedonia, which has one million residents opposed to Tito, and Communist Party members in Greece and Albania. The supporters of the Communist International in Macedonia advocate the establishment of an independent Macedonian state. (2) Montenegro, which has 300,000 residents, is the province with the most traditional pro-Soviet sentiment in Yugoslavia. (3) Croatia, which has 3.5 million residents, has strong anti-Tito forces, especially due to the influence of the Catholic Church.

### Britain Greatly Approves of the Conclusion of the Pacific Pact

Deeply Hope That Far Eastern Countries Will Strengthen Cooperation

[Reported by Our Newspaper] London, broadcast on the 21st: Since Philippine President Quirino advocated that the United States should lead the organization of the Pacific Pact, British officials have not commented on it, but it is generally believed that the British greatly approve of it. However, the British government has recently been most concerned about the impact of India's independence on the various autonomous territories. An informed source said: After the establishment of the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Pact, the Pacific Pact has become a natural consequence. If the Ding European countries continue to encounter setbacks in their position in the Far East, the prosperity of Ding Europe will be greatly affected in fact, and the United States will also suffer indirectly. However, the resources of the United States are ultimately limited. Therefore, places in the Far East such as Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Korea, Siam, Indonesia, Vietnam, and India must strengthen cooperation to resist the threat of communism.

### How to Win World Peace

â Biao

Unintentionally, today's world is a world dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union, or, in short, a bipolar world. At the same time, the two powers are playing distinctly different tunes. The Soviet Union has been infiltrating its political influence in Europe and Asia, while the Western European democratic bloc of countries, with the support of the United States, is also busy resisting. In this situation, one cannot help but wonder whether the life of the United Nations will end in the competition between the two powers, followed by the outbreak of World War III.

Since neither of the two powers currently has the strength to control the entire world, and the Soviet Union is currently entitled to recover the losses suffered during the war, it will not easily provoke a direct conflict with democratic countries. Although people are well aware that the United States surpasses any other country in military strength, possessing atomic bombs and strong land and sea forces, and backed by a large industrial capacity, it is unlikely to provoke a devastating war against public opinion, at least under the current democratic system.

Although Soviet leaders have different opinions on the future peace of the world, they have a firm and unchanging view that capitalism itself has an inherent error factor. Therefore, before the atomic bomb is manufactured, the Soviet Union will patiently wait for the demise of capitalism, except for waiting for opportunities.

However, a small number of extremists believe that the two ideologies have no reason to coexist and will eventually conflict. Instead of waiting until atomic bombs have all been manufactured before engaging in war, it is better to let it break out sooner, which can be resolved quickly and avoid a prolonged war that causes misery to the people. Obviously, this view is extremely wrong. The reasons can be summarized into roughly three points:

(1) Modern warfare relies not only on superior weapons to win, but also on possessing a large number of well-trained troops and rapid mobilization as a supplement to achieve the goal. With the advancement of modern warfare weapons, the key to victory lies in the two conditions of "blitzkrieg" and "surprise." The United States, which possesses atomic bombs, lacks both. (2) If the United States were to launch a war, it would inevitably have to seek a final victory. However, in the brutal process of modern warfare, both enemies and friends would inevitably be destroyed. The result would be nothing more than turning the two powers into one power, and this single-power world is not what the United States and the Soviet Union want. Therefore, launching World War III is meaningless. (3) If we were to use the power of atomic bombs to force the enemy to surrender, then in future international occasions, it would be difficult for us to get friendly countries to get along in mutual trust. The world after that would still be in an unstable state of mutual suspicion. If a country wins twice with atomic bombs, it will be difficult to win over friendly countries with mutual trust to jointly maintain world peace.

Based on the above reasons, stopping war with war is by no means a good strategy for seeking peace, unless there is a particularly provocative event between the two countries, or one party has a challenging behavior. We believe that world peace can still be achieved if properly managed. If the United States holds a view that the current state of mutual calm is only a temporary truce, and that once the opportunity matures, we will face a well-prepared and powerful enemy, then future peace will be difficult to sustain.

The current problem is that if the United States tries to maintain world peace solely by strengthening its military force, then the United States' preparations for war will be enough to stimulate the Soviet Union's preparations for war. If the United States has atomic bombs, the Soviet Union can also research and manufacture them. Such unlimited expansion of military power will result in an unprecedented and devastating war. In this war, both sides will use the latest weapons against each other, using long-range aircraft to bomb each other, turning prosperous cities into ruins in an instant. Even if victory is achieved, national strength and culture cannot be restored in a short period of time. As a result, the powers after the war will actually be inferior to underdeveloped countries that have not participated in the war, and will no longer be first-class powers that dominate the world.

The reasons why the United States was fortunate enough to win the past two world wars were nothing more than the following two points: (1) The United States was able to smoothly convert peacetime industries into wartime industries; (2) It used Western European allies as a forward base and the distance of the Atlantic Ocean to win sufficient time for mobilization and preparation.

However, in future atomic warfare, it will be extremely difficult to obtain the time to change industries. At the same time, the Western European powers are no longer as capable as before, and the distance of the ocean cannot be used as a security barrier. Unless the United States converts wartime industries before the outbreak of war, the United States' fighting power is expected to be far less than before. In the course of fierce war, if atomic bombs are used as weapons, regardless of the amount, the lives and property of both sides will be destroyed, and everyone will perish together.

Since war is not a blessing for either side, and peace is what the world hopes for, to win peace, the international order must first be balanced. So-called balancing means that the Soviet Union and Western European democratic countries can coexist and work for common interests, thereby reducing conflicts and animosity between the two powers.

If there are only the United States and the Soviet Union in the world, the future of peace will be worrying. It will be difficult for the two countries to maintain a balance. Fortunately, in addition to the two powers, there are many independent countries with vast resources and a large population, which can be intermediaries for collective security. If these intermediaries strengthen their power, they can become a powerful force for maintaining world peace and creating a balanced international order.

If the many intermediary countries are weak and chaotic, then these weak and chaotic countries can easily become satellite states of any one power, and the consequence will be that the balance of the world will be lost, and world turmoil will be unavoidable. On the other hand, if the politics of the intermediary countries can be stable, the economy can be revived, and they are not controlled by any one power, then not only can the two powers have room for buffer, but world peace can also be sustained as a result.

There are three ways to win international peace: (1) The United States establishes a powerful and unparalleled military force to force all countries to abide by their posts and jointly maintain international peace; (2) The United States and the Soviet Union directly conclude a treaty without other relations to implement an international non-interference policy; (3) Assist intermediary countries in establishing a Eurasian balanced system, so that different ideologies can coexist in the world, recognizing the existence of struggle, and using methods other than war to resolve disputes between the two countries.

We believe that the first method, in addition to deliberately building a strong military force, cannot achieve international coexistence, but only stimulates the determination of another power to expand its military. Using military force to maintain peace, peace will not be permanent, so seeking peace with military force is a dream.

The second method, in which the United States and the Soviet Union conclude a treaty alone and coexist with other friendly countries in a non-interfering manner, would certainly pose no problem for world peace if it could be realized. However, judging from the current situation, there are at least the following two difficulties: (1) Under the current circumstances, the United States and the Soviet Union still suspect each other, and in the past, they have held different views and funded different hostile policies of intermediary countries. Under these circumstances, even if a treaty is concluded, is it not dead in name only, and what is the use? (2) Among the two powers, there are still many countries with political corruption and economic disorder, and it is almost hopeless to reform on their own. If we sit idly by and allow the source of chaos to grow, it will eventually affect world peace. At this time, foreign aid is naturally needed. If, under the non-interference treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, these countries become poor and weak and unable to extricate themselves, and the weak are placed next to strong neighbors, war will inevitably occur, and peace will become a bubble.

The third method is to recognize the existence of the struggle between the two systems and to hope that this struggle exists in a peaceful state. This peaceful struggle is the so-called "cold war." The Cold War includes political and economic pressure on each other, ideological and psychological offensives, and other strategies such as using propaganda and infiltration to achieve the goal of its superiority. It is generally believed that the danger of the Cold War is nothing more than that the Cold War may provoke a hot war in the long run, but this is actually impossible. It must be understood that the Cold War was initiated because the Cold War initiator avoided a hot war.

In general, Cold War initiators must have many goals to be achieved in the Cold War, but it all depends on the situation. If they encounter resistance in the Cold War that is unexpected, they will stop after receiving a slight harvest. If the progress is smoother, they will intensify and demand more and bigger goals.

The reason why the Cold War is better than the Hot War is not only that the method is peaceful, but that it is possible to stop at the slightest benefit once it encounters resistance. However, once a Hot War is launched, it cannot be compromised halfway until victory or defeat is clear. Because of the brutality of the Hot War, no one dares to try it lightly, so there is a peaceful Cold War. Since differences between the two powers are inevitable, the Cold War cannot be eliminated. In the Cold War, the United States is using its huge economic power and solid resources to help the economic recovery of intermediary countries, so that they can become independent and prosperous, and be a stabilizing force for lasting world peace. However, the economic power of the United States is not inexhaustible, and the total wealth of the intermediary countries is no longer a force to be reckoned with. Therefore, how to effectively use this huge power is the US's peaceful Cold War strategy. The success or failure of the Cold War strategy is the success or failure of world peace. The Soviet Union is now using its only weapon to wage the Cold War, namely, thought and ideology. In the past, Gu Lian used this weapon to infiltrate the Balkans, Hungary, Greece, and the Near East, gaining widespread support.

In short, in order to win the support of intermediary countries, it is necessary not to force intermediary countries to adopt similar political and economic systems. The so-called international coexistence must be built on accommodating dissent, so that any country has a government that suits its own national conditions and resolves its own national destiny. In addition, international ideological exchanges, increased diplomatic relations, and treaty agreements can increase mutual understanding and understanding, so that countries with different systems can still coexist in a peaceful environment.

### The Third Ration of Rice This Month Will Be Replaced by Flour; Each Certificate Gets Five Jin at a Fixed Price of 2,100 Yuan; Sufficient Grain Reserves Mean White Rice Will Still Be Rationed Next Month

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu reported to newspaper reporters in the city government office at 5 pm yesterday that the third ration of rice this month would be replaced by flour across the board. Sales are scheduled to begin today (22nd) and end on March 31st. All citizens of this city can purchase five jin of American flour from the designated rice shops in their respective districts with the third section of their March ration certificate at a price of 2,100 gold yuan. Those with key ration certificates can purchase it for 1,600 gold yuan. The flour being rationed this time is processed in the United States, and its quality is superior to the previously rationed flour.

Mayor Wu then reported that the reason for replacing rice with flour was to help the American side clear out their inventory. The flour was originally intended to be transported to North China, but due to the disruption of transportation, it could not be transported. If it was not used in time, it was feared that it would be damaged over time. After the American side requested assistance, Mayor Wu believed that the city should accept the request, so he decided to replace the household rice with American flour across the board. Wu also hoped that citizens would not doubt the source of rice, as the city has sufficient rice reserves and the flour could be rationed in full this period. Next time onwards, white rice will continue to be rationed. In addition, the household rice rationing work in this city can definitely continue to be held after April. It will be decided again after the US Congress passes it in July.

### City Council and Other Eight Groups Telegraph the Central Government to Persuade the Mayor to Stay

[Reported by this newspaper] The City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, and other eight groups jointly telegraphed Acting President Li and Premier He of the Executive Yuan yesterday, unanimously requesting that Mayor Wu Guozhen be persuaded to stay. The original telegram stated: "Nanjing Acting President Li, Premier He of the Executive Yuan, Mayor Wu Guozhen of this city has outstanding talents and broad vision. Since taking office in Shanghai, he has been working hard for three years, with meticulous care. He has responded to difficulties and hardships, taken measures based on the people's sentiments, and devoted his spirit to municipal administration. He has been loyal to his oath and is both resolute and brave. He has experienced the elimination of hidden dangers and quelled major changes. Although his mind and body are exhausted, he is working harder. The citizens of the city deeply love and respect him, and international figures also praise him. Now that we hear that he has the intention to retire and has submitted his resignation several times, we are shocked to hear the news. The council members believe that Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country. At this time of turbulent situation, it seems inappropriate to change the head of the local administration. Although Mayor Wu has the intention to retire, it is not the time to take a high position. We unanimously urge Your Excellencies to be concerned about the development of Shanghai, and to grant him warm words of persuasion to stay, so as to comfort the people's hope. The citizens of Shanghai are very fortunate. Shanghai City Council, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai City Industrial Association, Shanghai City Local Association, Shanghai City Federation of Trade Unions, Shanghai City Farmers Association, Shanghai City Women's Association respectfully submit."

Telegraph the Mayor to Be Concerned About Public Opinion and Dismiss the Idea of Resigning

The City Council and other groups also telegraphed Mayor Wu, saying: "Mayor Guozhen, since you have been in charge of Shanghai's administration for three years, working hard and responding to difficulties, we have long admired and respected you. Now that we hear that you have the intention to retire and have submitted your resignation several times, we are shocked to hear the news. We have found that Shanghai relies on virtuous people to make up for omissions and overcome difficulties to have what it has today. However, the people's livelihood is declining and has not yet recovered. You should take care of the people in your arms and not be able to take a high position. In addition to unanimously urging Acting President Li and Premier He to persuade you to stay, we also telegraph to urge you to be concerned about public opinion in Shanghai, cancel your resignation, and reluctantly do your best to comfort the people's hope. The citizens of Shanghai are very fortunate."

### Wu's Resignation Submitted to the Central Government; Will Take Two Weeks of Leave to Rest

It seems that Shanghai Mayor Wu Zhengleng will leave his post. When Wu met with reporters at 5 pm on the 21st, he said: "Whether it is approved or not, I will leave!" This firm attitude is unprecedented in Wu's more than ten resignations. He also said that his health has been deteriorating recently, and he has been suffering from malignant malaria. He is deeply afraid of delaying official duties with a sick body, so he resolutely asks to resign. It is reported that Wu's resignation has been submitted to the Central Government, and it can be decided after the new cabinet is formed. However, he has prepared to take two weeks of leave to rest after Chen Liang, the new Secretary-General of the City Government, takes office on the 23rd, so that he can rest. Chen will temporarily replace all duties of the City Government. After the new mayor takes office, the handover will be carried out.

[Reported by this newspaper] The handover ceremony between the new and old directors of the Public Utilities Bureau, Chan Qiejie and Li, was held at 10 am yesterday on the fourth floor of the City Bank. The city government sent accountant He Xiangfan to supervise the handover. At the beginning of the ceremony, the outgoing director Zhao Zengjue gave a speech, saying: The reason for this short break is due to personal health reasons. He expressed his gratitude to the incoming director Zhang, Deputy Director Rentao, and all the staff for their cooperation in promoting the business. Zhao specifically pointed out that the handover this time is not only for material aspects, books, records, documents, etc., but also for the entire staff's service spirit, which is what he is most pleased with. He also encouraged all levels of staff to continue their efforts under the leadership of Director Zhang. After the speech, Accountant Min delivered a speech on behalf of the mayor, praising Zhao's outstanding achievements in presiding over the work of the Public Utilities Bureau for three and a half years, which not only surpassed the pre-war standards, but also created a number of new businesses. Then, the new director Zhang Rentao gave a speech, expressing his willingness to continue to work hard in accordance with the original plan set by Zhao, and hoped that all levels of staff would continue to assist him in the spirit of assisting Zhao. After the speech, the former director Zhao presented the seal to Accountant Min, who handed it over to Director Zhang for receipt. The ceremony was completed at around 12 o'clock.

Licking Blood on the Knife, Chen Huiling

### Following the Case of the Corpse in the Box, Another Horrific Blood Case; Dismembered Male Corpse Found Near Qi Lu Villa on Jinyi Road; Whereabouts of Head and Hands Still Under Investigation

[Reported by this newspaper] A horrific and bizarre case of a corpse dismembered into seven pieces in a box occurred at the North Railway Station in this city one afternoon. It shocked the society at that time. It has been more than two weeks since then, and the case has not yet been solved. Unexpectedly, at about 7:30 yesterday morning, another case of a male corpse dismembered into countless pieces was found near the back door of Qi Lu Villa on Jinyi Road in Shanghai West, hidden in yellow tarpaulin packages and travel bags. It can be said that it is not an isolated incident. The details are recorded below:

At about 7:30 yesterday morning, Li Changjiu, who was watching the public cemetery, discovered a yellow tarpaulin package shaped like luggage outside the back door of Qi Lu Villa (i.e., Shandong Fellow Association) at No. 465, the intersection of Jinyi Road and Xieshi Road. It was tied with white hemp rope. Then, a large travel bag was found in the nearby creek. Immediately moved by curiosity, he walked to the river bank and bowed his head to open the zipper of the travel bag. He saw many pieces that looked like pig knuckles. Upon closer inspection, they were not meat. Li was greatly suspicious and rushed to report to the accounting room of the Fellow Association, who reported it to the Changshu Road Police Station. The criminal section chief Chen Fenglin was dispatched, leading police officer Zhu Yunlin to investigate. The tarpaulin package was opened again, and it was found to be a dismembered body. It was determined to be a serious assassination case. Section Chief Chen telegraphed the branch director Cheng Yikuan, who personally led the deputy branch director Wang Sizu, the section chief, and several plainclothes police officers to the scene to investigate. It was found that the flesh in the travel bag was slightly discolored due to prolonged immersion in water, while the tarpaulin package contained two packages of limbs, a total of thirty-two pieces. Branch Director Cheng immediately reported to the headquarters and dispatched forensic doctor Dr. Liang Hanfen, together with detectives and police officers from the photography room Fang Meifa, etc., who arrived at the scene one after another.

It Is Presumed That the Deceased Was Definitely Not a Laborer

After repeated examinations by Dr. Liang, it was recorded that one part was chopped with a knife and the other part was sawed off. It was also determined that the dismemberment was after the person was killed. The body had no scars all over, and the cut of the bones and muscles was very neat. It was speculated that the deceased was about thirty-one or two years old, weighed about 160 pounds or more, and was about five feet and four inches tall. It was also inferred from the heels that this person was definitely not a laborer, and it was determined that the death period was no more than two days. The dismembered body includes (1) a section of neck meat, (2) a piece of bone under the neck, (3) a piece in the middle of the back, (4) a piece of hip under the waist, (5) a section of the upper left back, (6) two sections of the right forearm, (7) one section each of the upper part of the left and right thighs, (8) one section each of the center of the left and right knees, (9) one section each of the left and right calves, (10) five pieces of the left and right ankles, (11) one heart, (12) one-quarter of the kidney thief, (13) two pieces of the chest breasts, (14) ten pieces of broken muscles. The missing parts include the head, the left and right eyebrows, the front chest bone, the diaphragm, the internal organs, the upper half of the buttocks, the right front chest, the left and right palms, fingers, one section of the thigh, the left and right toes, half a kidney, and the genitals.

Lead Printed Strips in the Sleeves of a Woman's Jacket

The items placed under the body parts include a woman's cheongsam cotton wool strip, four silk cotton tires of children's open crotch pants, a square cotton tire, a tattered mattress cotton wool strip, a blue-faced and green-bottom cotton woman's short jacket, and a copy of the Ta Kung Pao dated December 14, 1948. A piece of paper with lead-printed characters of No. 6 was placed in the sleeve of the woman's short jacket, which reads "If people have hatred for me, it can be forgotten and not thought of." The paper strip is about one and a half inches long and about three inches wide. In addition, it rained all day the day before yesterday, and it did not stop until midnight, while the hemp rope on the oil bag was still dry. Therefore, it is predicted that the murderer moved the body to the place around five or six o'clock in the morning. After the forensic doctor examined it, the police officers transported the two packages of body parts to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. At the same time, the Tan Branch Bureau issued an arrest warrant for the fleeing murderer to bring him to justice.

### Unfilial Brother Addicted to Gambling; Attempted Murder of Brother Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhao Changgeng, who attempted to murder his brother, was sentenced to five years in prison by Judge Zhu Huaping of the District Court yesterday. His brother Zhao Jinpei has recovered from his injuries and was discharged from the hospital. He appeared in court yesterday to testify, feeling his brotherly love, and pleaded for leniency for his brother. The court did not grant his request because he violated the national law. The record shows that the defendant Zhao Changgeng was addicted to gambling and often asked his brother for loans, but he was not satisfied and had harbored resentment for a long time. At midnight on the 4th of last month, Changgeng took advantage of his brother Jinpei being asleep at home, sneaked into the bedroom with a knife, and stabbed his brother several times. Jinpei cried for help in pain and was rushed to the hospital by his family for treatment. He recovered his health. Upon hearing the news, the police station arrested Changgeng and transferred him to the district prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution.

### Forged Bill of Lading to Cheat; Cotton Cloth Broker Arrested

[Reported by this newspaper] On January 10, cotton cloth broker Wang Xifan colluded with his friend Hua Ziyu to forge several blank cotton cloth bills of lading printed by Beiping Shengshen Tun Zhuang Tutong. They went to the Leyuan Teahouse on Jiujiang Road for a tea party. Wang claimed to be the owner of Shen Zhuang and sold them to Wang Zhibin, Mei Quanyuan, Shen Shulin, Zhou Baohua, Ren Hanchen, Sun Jinde, and other six people, who were defrauded of 520,000 gold yuan. Wang returned 300,000 yuan to Hua Ziyu, and used the other 220,000 to purchase 40 pieces of white fine cloth, which he hid in the home of Xue Wu at No. 6, Lane 82, Beihai. After the incident occurred, Wang fled without a trace. The victims reported to the Laozha Police Station one after another, and the case was put on the wanted list. It was not until about 2:00 am on the 16th that a tip-off was received, saying that the suspect was hiding in No. 119, Zhongshan North Road. The white fine cloth was stored for investigation.

### Corpse in Trunk Case: Discovery of Money Traces; Someone in Jiangyin Recognizes the Deceased

[Our Telegraph from Tiaozhou, 21st] Regarding the sensational train trunk corpse case, it is now reported that according to news received from Jiangyin, an employee of a certain organization in that county suspected that the deceased was a friend of his. He sent a letter to Shanghai for inquiries. The authorities immediately dispatched a special person to Cheng (Jiangyin) a few days ago to meet with the employee and brought multiple photos of the deceased. As a result, it is said that important clues have been obtained, and preparations are underway to go to Hangzhou for on-site investigation. It is learned that the deceased was a soldier who married in Hangzhou and then went on an expedition with the army for more than half a year. His wife remained in Hangzhou. This time upon his return, he was dismembered into seven pieces. There must be some clues to be found in this.

### Surging and Sinking Speculative Mania: A Typical Figure â Throwing Gold, Lending Money, Sometimes Earning, Sometimes Losing, Ultimately Facing Great Defeat

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Little Zhang, it is unknown where he is from. His colleagues in the office only knew that he was a long-time resident of Nanjing and had just received a bachelor's degree in economics from a prestigious university in Nanjing half a year ago. His uncle was the deputy manager of the business department of a powerful bank in Shanghai. With this connection, Little Zhang became an investigation specialist in the department managed by his uncle. Little Zhang never understood the Shanghai style of his colleagues in the office. Seeing them set aside their official duties to inquire about the market prices of gold, paper money, and stocks, he thought, "These guys really deserve to die, just taking money and not working. I must set an example for them!"

But a month or two passed, and Little Zhang mixed in the office and ran around outside. His stubborn Beijing style finally began to waver. Moreover, the money he received based on the cost of living index bought less and less each month. He thought that in this day and age, he should use his business acumen. With the economic theories he learned at the university, as well as his contacts and social interactions, he was not afraid of not being able to win in the business world. Having made up his mind, Little Zhang found several gold speculation firms through introductions. He only needed to pay two taels of margin to trade futures contracts of ten taels per bar.

Receiving News, Selling Two Bars

That night, Little Zhang somehow received absolutely accurate news that the Central Bank, in order to contract the currency supply to cooperate with the implementation of the new financial plan, had decided to continuously sell large quantities of gold, silver dollars, foreign exchange transfer certificates, cotton yarn, sugar, and so on. He thought that since the announcement of the new financial plan, prices had already risen several times and seemed to have reached a saturation point. The market's money supply had approached the seven-corner level. According to the quantity theory of money, the general price level is directly proportional to the quantity of currency and its velocity of circulation. Therefore, the price of gold would definitely fall in the following days. Tomorrow, he would find the right market price to sell short and borrow money, which would be a good deal.

The next morning, Little Zhang signed in at the office and sneaked out under the pretext of conducting an investigation. He arrived at the gold firm. There were still ten minutes before the market opened, but the unofficial gold market was still hovering at a high level. At 9:30 AM, the market opened at a high of 3.35 million, and Little Zhang, feeling that he had found the right opportunity, sold two bars. He mortgaged four small gold bars borrowed from his colleague Old Ma. The 6.7 million yuan he earned from selling short was credited to his account by the gold firm at an interest rate of seven corners.

Gold Becomes Cheap, Interest Rates High: Double Income

Little Zhang's dream did not fail. On the day he sold short, the gold market initially hovered at a high level. Just as the market was evening out near noon, news suddenly came that the Central Bank was selling to the market through a certain gold firm, in lots of ten or twenty bars. The market price fell by more than ten levels in a quarter of an hour, eventually closing at 2.97 million. Little Zhang was overjoyed with his initial victory. He boasted to his colleagues, who praised him for having a "promising start." Little Zhang, following the trend, said, "Watch me make a promising start for two more days!"

Indeed, in the following two days, the Central Bank not only sold gold in the gold market but also sold yarn, sugar, and foreign exchange transfer certificates. All market prices were suppressed. The money supply was tightened to an unprecedented level, and the daily interest rate exceeded one yuan. On the fourth day after Little Zhang sold gold, he thought he had earned enough and decided to cover his position. Calculating his gains, he had earned seven corners of interest per day, one yuan and one corner of interest in two days, plus the difference between selling high and buying low, for a total profit of more than 2.3 million gold yuan. He bought back seven taels of gold at the market price of 3.3 million on that day, with some gold yuan still left over. What a great profit, how could it not make everyone in the office envious? However, Little Zhang still felt that he had not earned enough. Because after he covered his position, the market price continued to hover for two days, and the daily interest rate remained at seven or eight corners.

After this, Little Zhang's interest in and confidence in speculating in the gold market suddenly increased. He told people that the first time was just a small try, a little "promising start," and that the real skill was yet to come. Sure enough, in the subsequent rounds of buying and selling, Little Zhang was almost always successful, at most only having the problem of earning enough versus not earning enough.

Receiving News Again, Selling Ten Bars

One day, Little Zhang again received inside information from some well-informed source that the authorities were going to sell off large quantities. Seeing that the money supply had been loose and excessive for a while, as long as there was news of the authorities selling off large quantities, the money supply would inevitably tighten, and the daily interest rate would rise. Having made up his mind, he decided to sell short ten bars in one go.

The next morning, the gold market opened at 3.75 million, and the daily interest rate was about six corners. Within half an hour, the price of gold actually rose to the four million mark due to the continued loose money supply. When would he sell if not now? This time, Little Zhang resolutely sold short ten bars, immediately paying the margin for two bars. However, this time, because the money supply was loose, and rumors spread in the market that the authorities had a large remittance outflow, the money supply flooded, and the daily interest rate opened low, only about five corners.

Price Plunges, Loses Everything

Little Zhang told everyone he met: "The 'promising start' of this transaction is yet to come. Just wait and see." He planned to hold on for three days. On the first day, not only did the price of gold exceed the four million mark in the morning, but the next day's trading price rose to over 4.5 million. On the second day, the authorities had no news of selling anything, but remittances continued to flow in from other cities, the money supply remained loose, and the daily interest rate plummeted to only four and a half corners. The price of gold rose even further to 4.8 million. On the third day, the trend remained the same. Little Zhang was determined to hold on to the end, but unexpectedly, on the fourth day, the authorities suddenly released a large amount of "ice eggs" (frozen goods) worth tens of billions, the market's money supply completely flooded, and the price of gold broke through the five million mark, soaring to 5.35 million. Little Zhang, who had always been confident, turned pale. His previous gains, after calculation, not only returned everything, but also resulted in a loss of five or six taels. The two taels of margin paid to the gold firm now only had one or two taels left. Old Min, the gold firm owner, was opportunistic. Seeing that Little Zhang's margin was insufficient, he not only demanded additional margin but also advised Little Zhang to cover his position and settle the account as soon as possible! In this situation of being besieged on all sides, Little Zhang finally had no choice but to painfully close his position.

Fantasy of Getting Rich Disappears; Vows Never to Speculate Again

This was a "lost weekend." On the train back to Nanjing, Little Zhang carefully calculated the net loss of this final battle. Not only did it swallow up all his previous speculative gains, but it also dragged him into a debt of five taels to his colleagues. There was no choice but to go home and beg his wife for some of her few pieces of jewelry. He stared blankly at the fleeting suburban scenery outside the train window, and the beautiful fantasy he had envisioned was just as fleeting as the scenery: he couldn't help but grind his teeth and complain: "These damn 'ice eggs,' damn financial authorities!" He vowed that after this lesson, he would wash his hands and never speculate again!

### Barber Shop Prices Divided into Five Grades and Ten Levels; Proposed Base Numbers Seem Too High; Social Affairs Bureau Instructs to Wait for Meeting to Discuss

[News from Our Newspaper] The issue of setting the base numbers for barber shop prices and multiplying them by the cost of living index has not yet been resolved. The Barber Shop Trade Association has already submitted a list of base numbers to the Social Affairs Bureau. Several standing directors and directors of the association went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon and jointly studied the matter with Section Chief Xi of the Social Affairs Bureau. They proposed that barber shops should be divided into five grades and ten levels. The special grade was 1.7 yuan before the war (multiplied by 2.5, the same below), and the current proposed base number is 4.25 yuan. The special grade deputy was 1.3 yuan before the war, and the current proposed base number is 3.25 yuan. The Grade A positive was 1 yuan before the war, and the current proposed base number is 2.5 yuan. The Grade A deputy was 8 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 2 yuan. The Grade B positive was 6.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 2.625 yuan. The Grade B deputy was 5.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 1.225 yuan. The Grade C positive was 4.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 1.125 yuan. The Grade C deputy was 3.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 8.75 yuan. The Grade D positive was 2.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 6.25 yuan. The Grade D deputy was 1.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 3.75 yuan. They stated that due to increased water and electricity costs and huge expenses, it would not be enough to maintain if the prices were doubled according to the pre-war prices and multiplied by the cost of living index, as approved by the Municipal Council. Therefore, they slightly increased the prices by referring to the regulations of the hotel industry, which stipulate that pre-war room rates should be increased by 2.2 times, and calculated them at 2.5 times. For example, if the base number of Grade A positive is 2.5 yuan, multiplying it by the 1339.36 times on the 15th of this month would result in a charge of 3348.4 yuan per haircut. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the set base numbers are too high and is concerned that it will cause resentment among citizens. It instructed the representatives to go back first and wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to review the matter in detail before convening another meeting for discussion.

### Joint-Stock Coarse Company Suffers Losses; Qian Xue'an Accused of Embezzlement

[News from Our Newspaper] The case of Qian Xue'an being accused of embezzlement was heard in court yesterday. It is reported that Qian, in September 1946, gathered many shareholders to form Tianli Construction Company, with a capital of 100 million national currency, and a paid-in capital of 89 million. Qian served as the general manager. In May 1947, Qian reorganized Tianxin Chemical Plant. In May 1948, Qian convened a shareholders' meeting of Tianli Company and announced losses. Lin Shishan, one of the shareholders who also served as the accounting director, filed a complaint, believing that Qian used his position to embezzle company assets and enrich himself, such as using Tianli funds to invest in Tianxin Chemical Plant for his personal benefit, and that the equipment of Tianxin was also moved from the soda ash factory attached to Tianli Company. Qian argued in court yesterday that all the accusations were false and that Lin was not a shareholder at all. The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing.

### Accused of Enticement and Rape, Zhang Yu Sentenced to Imprisonment

[News from Our Newspaper] The case of Zhang Yu being accused of enticement and rape by Huang Lihong was heard in court yesterday. Huang tearfully recounted the details of the rape, stating that on December 24 of last year, she met Zhang at the Weida Dance Hall through her sister Lifen. They began to associate with each other, and on the night of December 31, Zhang lured her to the Wu Palace Hotel and raped her. The next day, they moved to the Dazhongzhang Hotel and spent the night together. She then learned that Zhang was already married and, filled with regret, informed her sister by phone, who told her mother, who brought her home. The defendant Zhang Yu admitted to all of the above, only saying that he was confused and made a big mistake, and that he regretted it endlessly. The court sentenced him to ten months of imprisonment.

### Sun Keqiang Accused of Malfeasance; Related to Detention of Monk; Director Mao Decides to Thoroughly Investigate and Punish

Police Chief Sun Keqiang of the Zhabei Branch was detained on the 20th by order of Director Mao Sen of the General Bureau due to suspicion of shielding malfeasance. The Criminal Division of the bureau is now conducting a detailed investigation to deal with the matter according to law. According to Zheng Tingxian, Director of the Criminal Division of the bureau, the secret report letter regarding the case of the monk of the Sun Temple committing adultery, which was received by the branch chief, did not have the address of the informant and had no postmark. It did not constitute a legitimate report. Furthermore, the branch chief did not follow procedures and order the Judicial Section or the police station chief to send police to investigate. Instead, he privately and directly ordered a uniformed policeman from the police station (reportedly Sun's former subordinate) to collude with local hooligans and go together. This administrative procedure was also improper. In addition, when the monk was brought to the bureau, two gold rings weighing more than six qian extorted by the policeman were found on the desk in the branch chief's office, and the policeman hid in the branch chief's inner room and dared not come out. All of this indicates that the branch chief may have shielded his subordinates' corruption and malfeasance. Zheng said: Director Mao was extremely angry after this case occurred. In order to rectify discipline and eradicate corruption, this case will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished to serve as a warning to others.

### Set Price of Regular Meal; Adjusted with Rice Price; Maximum of 1,500 Yuan; To Be Implemented After Approval by the Municipal Government

In order to standardize the price of regular meals, the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives from the Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Finance Bureau, Police Bureau, and Restaurant Trade Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter.

### Wuxi Love Triangle Murder Retrial: Philandering Military Officer Cannot Escape Death

[Report from our Wuxi correspondent on the 20th] Zhang Jiming, the perpetrator of the sensational "Love Triangle Murder" in Wuxi, was apprehended in Shanghai by the Investigation Team. After being handed over to the City Defense Headquarters, he underwent multiple interrogations by the Military Tribunal. Due to conclusive evidence, he was sentenced to death according to the law. The sentence was submitted to the First Pacification District Headquarters and then to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters for review. However, orders were subsequently issued for a retrial with additional witnesses. On the afternoon of the 19th, the City Defense Headquarters Military Tribunal complied by summoning witnesses Zhang Yuting, Zhang Xiaohei, Xu Arong, Chen Chengshi, Zhang Jinxiang, as well as Wu Wenhua, the director of Dahua Hospital, and Li Zhongtang, the director of Hongen Hospital, for questioning. Military Judge Chen Shimin presided over the hearing.

Shouting "Ji Ming Killed Me" Before Death

According to Zhang Yuting, 50 years old, from Hebei, an opera performer residing at the Zhongdong Theater, and the adoptive father of the deceased couple Zhao Qingsheng and Zhang Yuyan, at the time of the incident, I had already fallen asleep. Suddenly, I heard the sound of gunfire. Someone woke me up, and as I was getting dressed, Qingsheng suddenly pressed his right waist and crawled into the room, shouting, "Dad, Zhang Jiming shot me!" He then collapsed on the ground. Later, I entered Wang Yan's room, where she had already been shot dead in bed. Because I heard that Ji Ming had a gun, I dared not pursue him. I immediately sent the injured man to Hongen Hospital and reported the incident to the Investigation Team. Previously, Ji Ming had sent me a threatening letter. Then, Zhang Xiaohei, 14 years old, an opera performer who lived in the same room with Yuyan and Qingsheng, testified that they two slept in the same bed, I slept under the table. At the time of the incident, I heard Yuyan shout in my sleep, "Dad, Zhang Jiming shot me!" I was immediately startled awake. Looking up, I saw Zhang Jiming holding a bright silver pistol, pointing it at my sister Yuyan. The second shout did not sound like a human voice, but like a ghostly wail. I was so frightened that I dared not look again. Then I heard another gunshot, and Ji Ming fled. He pointed to the pistol presented in court, claiming that it was the same pistol. Following this, Chen Chengshi, Yuting's wife's younger sister, who also lived at the Dongxin Hotel, gave a statement consistent with the statements of Yuting and Xiaohei.

The Murder Scene Witnessed by a Tea Boy

Furthermore, Wu Wenhua, the director of Dahua Hospital, testified that he did not know Zhang Jiming. Zhao Qingsheng was sent to the hospital for treatment at 6:00 AM on January 25, 1938. He was sent over after being treated at Hongen Hospital. He was sent to the operating room without registering. When asked, he said he was shot. After the wound was bandaged, he was asked again, and Zhao's expression was extremely resentful, "gritting his teeth and shouting, 'That Zhang kid!'" Then, Li Zhongtang, the director of Hongen Hospital, testified that Zhang Yuting sent Zhao Qingsheng to the hospital for treatment in a rickshaw around 4:00 AM. Zhao said, "Dad, quickly go and arrest Zhang Jiming." I examined him and found two bullet wounds in each of his thighs and one in his abdomen, with four holes on his legs. I determined that he had been shot two or one times. Subsequently, Xu Arong testified. Xu was a tea boy at the Dongxin Hotel. He said he did not know Zhang Jiming. I am here today to testify, and I will definitely tell the truth. The two actors Zhao and Zhang lived in room 12 of the Dongxin Hotel. I know all about how they were shot dead. He then described how Zhang Jiming entered the hotel late at night during curfew, his appearance, what clothes he was wearing, and how he left after the incident. Finally, he firmly stated that the two actors were killed with the pistol presented in court.

Three Identifications, Difficult to Deny

One of the witnesses, Zhang Jinxiang, was presented by the perpetrator Zhang Jiming. According to his testimony, he is 40 years old, from Guangdong, resides in Nanjing, runs a theater, and is friends with Ji Ming. Around December of the lunar calendar, they met once at the Public Recreation Club. At that time, he told everyone, "The Cultural Troupe wants to invite Peking opera actors. I can go to Shanghai and find them." Later, I heard that he had killed someone, and I have not seen him since. Finally, Military Judge Chen summoned the suspect Zhang Jiming to the court. According to his testimony, he is from Liling, Hunan, and is a major political officer in the Capital Garrison Headquarters. He met Zhang Wangyan in the theater troupe and had a physical relationship with her. She wanted to marry me, but I didn't dare to. I only met Zhao Qingsheng once. I did not kill him. On January 26, I went from Nanjing to Shanghai, and on the 27th, I went to the Garrison Department to see Director Zhang, requesting a transfer. Meanwhile, I was in Shanghai to find actors. On the 26th, when the incident occurred, I was in Shanghai. Finally, Zhang Xiaohei and Xu Arong, who witnessed the scene, were summoned to the court again. After Military Judge Chen interrogated and identified them three times in a row, it was undoubtedly Zhang Jiming who was the principal offender in this case. The department has now submitted the results of the retrial to the First Pacification District Headquarters for review. It is widely believed that the "philandering military officer" will ultimately not escape death.

### Hangzhou Incense Pilgrimage: Talking About Sericulture and Farming

â Special correspondent from our newspaper, Chu Yusheng

[Report from our Hangzhou correspondent on the 19th] Spring in Hangzhou is like a painting. The beauty of the lakes and mountains is mixed with tourists, both men and women, especially those farmers who wear blue cotton jackets and carry yellow cloth bags to burn incense and pay homage to the Buddha. They walk in groups along the embankments and shores, reflecting their shadows in the lake. How poetic and picturesque! Although we stand from a position of appreciation to view this tranquil and comfortable paradise scene, if we further penetrate the feelings of the people in the painting, there must be a lot of bitterness and everyday life. Those farmers, they come to Hangzhou not to travel and play, but to sincerely burn incense and worship Buddha, seeking happiness for the year. Therefore, in the rural areas of Jiangnan, as long as one mentions going to Hangzhou to burn incense at the Buddhist temple, everyone will put everything aside and work hard to go. In the years of peace, for the sake of peace and prosperity, for the sake of abundant silkworm cocoons, and for the sake of abundant harvests, no farmer's family would fail to send one or two people to Hangzhou to burn incense. This year's situation is obviously different. There are not as many boats from Songmuchang as in previous years, and there are only a few people carrying yellow cloth bags along the embankments and shores. I asked several old ladies, and what they told me really made us feel sad.

Last year's harvest was not very good, but the orders to collect grain and conscript soldiers were unusually urgent. The grain was harvested from the fields, threshed into rice, and carried to the town to pay taxes. The people weighing the grain would either say that the grain was wet and not accept it, or they would turn the small scale into a large scale, and if the weight was insufficient, they would have to bring more to compensate. From the township to the fields, it takes a day's journey, and the wages and food of the boatmen have to be taken care of by themselves. Some people avoid trouble, as long as they show respect to the grain collectors, they can get away with it. Look at the faces of those grain collectors, they are more fierce than the bodhisattva guarding the entrance of the City God Temple! As for soldiers, those with money and power, even if a family has five or six strong men, will not have problems. But poor families, even if they have only one son to rely on for life, will be drafted. They beg the head of the village, but the head of the village says this is a public matter. They beg the head of the district, but the head of the district says this is an order from above. After bitter pleading, they finally agree, but they must pay two or three dan of rice as a settlement fee for the conscript.

They don't know anything about agricultural loans and cooperatives. During the spring plowing season, they still have to borrow some from the powerful families to make ends meet. Several times, it was said that the officials in the town received orders from the officials in the county to investigate and inspect, and they had to be treated to big fish and big meat. They wiped their mouths and left, and the remaining debt was spread on the poor and powerless.

Their houses are still built by their ancestors, and they don't have the ability to add new homes now. The big pigs and small pigs in the pigsties are gradually decreasing. The waterwheels, plows, and hoes used for plowing are all old, and the old cattle are also weak. Their only blame is that it is destined in fate. Only by sincerely believing in the Bodhisattva can they be reborn in the next life as an official in the town, or as a person who makes a fortune, builds tall houses, adds new furniture, and fills the pigsties with pigs. Then they don't have to go to the fields to farm themselves, and they can comfortably enjoy themselves. This is the only fantasy of burning incense. This year, the rice stored at home is all gone. The incense leader everywhere asks people to come to Hangzhou to burn incense, but each person needs seven dou of rice. Seven dou of rice is not a small number in a farming family that produces food. In addition, after taking the rice out to burn incense, they don't know how to live when they come back, and they also heard that the situation is not good, so there are not as many people coming to Hangzhou to burn incense this time as in previous years.

Based on the above-mentioned accounts of these old ladies, we can already understand the situation of our countryside. The people in the cities take everything from the countryside. What about the countryside? Only giving, not receiving, let alone leaving some benefits to the countryside. Under layers of exploitation, our countryside has become extremely anemic, extremely declining, and extremely paralyzed. The countryside, under layers of constraints, their ideas are also very backward. They still have the ideas of the 19th century, wanting to be officials and make a fortune. They still ask the Bodhisattva to give comfort, happiness, and joy!

Rural education cannot be delayed any longer, giving them new production skills, giving them new knowledge, giving them new farm tools, giving them new methods!

China is still an agricultural country after all. Our true masters have been silent, enduring hardships for so many years. They are about to be paralyzed and on the verge of desperation. Truly, when the nest is overturned, there are no intact eggs. We must improve all methods of administration.

In the spring, under the quiet and tranquil atmosphere of West Lake, many poetic and picturesque scenes are left for poets and writers to chant and write about. The above-mentioned facts should also be cited as the best material for reality.

### Victims of the Fire on Liyuan Road in the South City Send a Letter to the Public Asking for Righteous Support

Expressing Resistance to Profiteering from the Fire and the Landlords' Eviction Tactics

Dear Editor: We are a group of refugees who fled to Shanghai. Two years ago, unable to withstand the threat of the civil war's artillery fire, we came to Shanghai together. We worked hard and built some thatched sheds and plank houses on Liyuan Road to shield ourselves from the wind and rain. A family of several people, young and old, rely on manual labor to survive. Daily life is already hard enough. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, another fire broke out, and more than 300 of our shacks were all reduced to ashes. The situation was like this: around 2 PM that day, a fire broke out in a shack due to careless use of the stove. The South Shanghai District Fire Brigade was immediately notified to come and put out the fire. However, the Liyuan Road area has always lacked fire hydrants. Although the firefighters were quick to work, the water supply was too far away, and the wind added to the situation. By the time the water reached the fire, the fire had already burned very fiercely. After the fire was extinguished, none of our more than 300 families were spared. When the fire broke out, we were all working outside due to the demands of life and couldn't rush back in time. Therefore, although the women managed to salvage a few household items, they were looted by a group of thugs who took advantage of the fire. Now we are cleaning up the ashes, but there is another message that is enough to make us heartbroken: the landlords are using various means, trying to reclaim the property rights, and drive us away. We ask, after such a great disaster, how can we have the strength to move elsewhere? We cry out for help in vain, and have no way to enter the earth. We have always admired your newspaper as the mouthpiece of the people, so we borrow a corner of your newspaper to reveal this, hoping that the government authorities and the public will give us righteous support. With best regards, the entire fire victims of Liyuan Road bowãMarch 10ãVictim representatives Wang Hongfei, Xu Yongnian, Xia Guoyun, Zhang Qiaxiang, Proving the facts: Shi Shoudong, head of the 72nd Bao of Penglai District (seal)

### A Faint Wind Blows Across Hong Kong

â Our reporter, Zijian

[Airmail report from our Hong Kong correspondent on the 18th] Two shocking events have recently occurred in the Hong Kong business community: a major firm engaged in trade between Hong Kong and Siam declared bankruptcy, owing more than two million yuan in payment for goods. A fairly large-scale weaving factory was also seized by the court due to debts of more than 200,000 yuan. Sensitive merchants have already shouted the catchphrase "economic downturn," but judging from the current situation in Hong Kong, "a faint wind has blown to Hong Kong" is indeed an indisputable fact.

According to a person in charge of a major British merchant bank in Hong Kong, the financial industry in Hong Kong is currently facing a depression that has not been seen in 40 years. The business of major banks is currently more than 30% lower than at the peak last year. In view of the shadow of the economic downturn, Chinese and foreign banks in Hong Kong have now taken various emergency measures, the most significant of which are two: (1) Increasing the margin for export bills. The imported goods in Hong Kong have now greatly exceeded the needs of the actual market, so the price of goods has fallen, even to a point lower than the margin for export bills. When the merchants cannot support themselves, the banks also suffer losses. All foreign banks have recently raised the margin for export bills from 25% to more than 50%. More restrictions are placed on importers and exporters with weak credit. In order to protect its own interests, the bank further increases the difficulties of merchants. (2) Reducing mortgage loans and stopping all risky loans. In January of this year, general property mortgages could still reach 60% of the original value, but recently it has been reduced to less than 50%, with the lowest reaching 30%. Banks seem to fear that the currently excessively high property values ââin Hong Kong may decline significantly in the future. The number of goods mortgaged has also been greatly reduced. "Unpopular" goods are even refused mortgages. It is said that some British merchant banks have been ordered by their London headquarters to avoid pledging too many securities and stocks, and those that have expired must be paid off on time, and no extensions are allowed. This has caused a general decline in stock prices.

Due to the decline in import and export trade and the tightening of bank credit, Hong Kong merchants are now feeling great pressure. Those who cannot support themselves can only close down, and the two bankruptcies mentioned above are significant examples. According to an economic survey, Hong Kong's trade with China in the first quarter of this year has fallen to the lowest level since the war. Recently, the Guangdong provincial authorities have severely dealt with small-scale smuggling "water traders" in water and land transportation, which has also greatly reduced the business of general retailers in Hong Kong. Reflected in the market, tea houses, restaurants, and dance halls are desolate, and "sale" flags are planted all over the streets. Hong Kong's trade with Southeast Asia is also shrinking unprecedentedly due to competition from Japanese goods, and the weaving industry is particularly hit hard.

According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, there are 322 weaving factories in Hong Kong, and 132 have gone bankrupt. Of the 190 remaining, only 90 are still in operation. Other industries such as enamelware, rubber shoes, flashlights, and lanterns also feel that the market is narrowing and crises are lurking. The current expectations of Hong Kong merchants for new markets such as North China, Korea, Taiwan, and Europe can only be explained as an attempt to "find another way out" in difficult circumstances.

However, while a faint wind is blowing through the Hong Kong market, the Hong Kong government has proposed the largest budget in history for the next fiscal year, reaching a total of HK$180,019,370 (an increase of HK$31,014,363 from this year), with an average burden of about 100 yuan per resident. According to this huge budget, the Hong Kong government (at least for now) does not admit that Hong Kong has fallen into an economic downturn. The Hong Kong government's estimated revenue for the next fiscal year includes direct taxes, tobacco, alcohol, and cosmetics taxes, as well as food and beverage, lottery, and entertainment taxes, which account for more than half of the total (totaling HK$95,775,000). It can be seen that the Hong Kong government expects the market in Hong Kong to be quite prosperous in the coming year.

Compared with this year's income and expenditure, the Hong Kong government has a fiscal surplus of 24 million yuan. Adding the surplus figures for the previous two years, the surplus figure in the Hong Kong treasury is 60 million yuan. According to Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Huo Laoshi's report, "He believes that this figure is not enough for Hong Kong to get through its period of nutritional deficiency." He advocates that Hong Kong establish a large reserve fund to cope with unexpected needs. It is not known whether the so-called "unexpected needs" is an hint of a "period of economic downturn?"

The Hong Kong government explained the increase in the next fiscal year's budget, and strongly emphasized the issue of Hong Kong's security, so it requested a large amount of administrative expenses to expand the police force and establish the Hong Kong Defense Force. The Financial Secretary said: "The core of the budget is security." It is said that those directly or indirectly used for security will reach 26 million yuan. The highest authorities of the Hong Kong government also have a statement of "preparing for the worst and hoping for the best." Living on a small island, the people are worried about the invasion of the economic downturn, while the officials are worried about the security problem. This is thought provoking!

### Jiangxi Cotton Production

â Our reporter, Liu Zao

This came from foreign lands to the Central Plains,
The sacred sound and essence are truly the source,
With clear feet and bright eyes, the seeds are spread,
The merits of cultivation and weaving illuminate the common people.

ââ Emperor Qianlong's inscription on the Baoding Cultivation and Weaving Picture ââ

Jiangxi's cotton production is usually only five to six million catties per year. Given the current population of 12 million, each person needs one catty of cotton per year to make clothing and bedding fillings. The existing cotton production is not even half of the required amount. Therefore, Jiangxi's annual import of cotton textiles exceeds the total value of grain exports. Looking around the countryside, how many people's clothes can cover their bodies without showing the poor image of tattered clothes!

Jiangxi's textile industry is now in its infancy. The Jiujiang Xingzhong Yarn Factory has 20,000 spindles, and the Nanchang Xinsheng Yarn Factory currently has 2,000 spindles and may add another 3,000 spindles in the short term. The two factories need about 50,000 dan of fine short-staple raw cotton annually, more than 90% of which relies on supplies from Hankou and Anqing. The green-seed American cotton produced in the alluvial layer along the Poyang Lake area, such as Pengze, only accounts for 10% of the supply to the textile industry. The cotton for clothing and bedding fillings in the countryside, in addition to a part taken from the province's production, is mostly imported from Huangmei and Wuxue in southern Hubei and the Dongting Lake area in Hunan Province. In addition, cotton textiles imported from Beijing and Shanghai, of course, also replace part of the cotton consumption.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Cotton Production Improvement Department is coordinating the increase in cotton production nationwide.

Jiangxi is now listed as one of the provinces that are self-sufficient in cotton production. Therefore, increasing cotton production in Jiangxi is a major issue in Jiangxi's economic development. In the past two years, the promotion of cotton production has achieved considerable results through the efforts of the Northern Jiangxi Cotton Planting Guidance Office. Last year, the cotton planting in Yongxiu, Pengze, and other places was affected by the biggest flood in more than ten years, which affected the cotton harvest. However, cotton farmers' use of and confidence in the improved cotton variety - Dai-Character Cotton - has been improved. In the future, Jiangxi's cotton production will enter a stage of increased production to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency.

The results of land reclamation and experimentation by the Northern Jiangxi Cotton Field in Pengze:

American Cotton Regional Experiment

Including the main American cotton varieties introduced by former countries, the varieties selected and bred by domestic agricultural agencies, and the degraded American cotton varieties cultivated locally in the Northern Jiangxi region, a total of 18 varieties. The results of the experiment showed that the average yield of seed cotton was 165.6 catties per mu (Chinese acre). The yield of Jingzhi Cotton (207.4) catties was the highest, followed by D.P.L-14 (191.4) catties, Suining No. 75 (188.7) catties ranked third, and Huanong No. 2 (185) catties ranked fourth. The Pengze promotion species of Dai-Character Cotton ranked fifth with (178.8) catties. The Pengze degraded American cotton D531 and FOSTER 63 varieties ranked first, second, and third from the bottom with (144.8) catties, (146.1) catties, and (147.4) catties per mu, respectively. The Dai-Character Cotton has a particularly high lint percentage and its maturity period is slightly earlier than the De-Character Cotton, which is indeed a variety that can be promoted at present. Jingzhi Cotton and Suining No. 75 are early-maturing and high-yielding, grow neatly, and have a medium-to-high lint percentage, which are particularly noteworthy. Jingzhi Cotton was originally developed in the Si-Character Cotton system adapted to the cotton-growing area of the Yellow River Basin. Now it is also adapted to the cotton-growing area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and shows excellent results. According to people in charge of increasing cotton production in Jiangxi, this experiment is worth studying and is a very interesting result.

### The Gold Market Opens Today: Gold Business Association Held Reopening Ceremony Yesterday; Seven Market Management Committee Members Elected

### Trading of Silver and Silver Dollars Under Study by Financial Authorities

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, although the members of the Gold Business Association are resuming market trading today, and the trading object is temporarily limited to gold only, silver and silver dollars will also be added to the trading in the next step. The financial authorities are currently studying the next step of the plan so that the prices of gold and silver can achieve overall stability.

### Money Market Turns Steady After Easing

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market still showed a trend of easing in the morning. Daily interest rates opened at 60 yuan, and there was no significant change in the process. There was ample supply from both inside and outside the industry.

After 3 PM, news suddenly came that the national bank had entrusted people to release gold three times, totaling 600 large bars. All were used to settle the day's positions. The money market immediately turned steady during the exchange, and the final daily interest rate rose to about 70-80 yuan.

Yesterday, national banks took in more than 1.98 billion yuan, foreign firms paid out more than 200 million yuan, major exchanges took in more than 1.25 billion yuan, and minor exchanges paid out more than 3.02 billion yuan.

### Top-Quality Rice Surges Past 60,000 Yuan; Flour Prices Remain Firm; Edible Oil Prices Soar

The rice market continues to rise. Due to the easing of the money market, prices in the producing areas are rising, and sentiment is particularly strong. In the North Shanghai market, white rice and Pingdao rice have both risen by 3,000 yuan, with prices at 58,000 yuan. Top-quality rice is priced at over 60,000 yuan, opening at 61,000 yuan. In the South Shanghai market, the market opened with a rise of 3,000 yuan. In the Central Shanghai market, due to poor appetite among rice shops, there was a slight decline. White rice was priced at 56,000 yuan, and Boodao rice at 57,500 yuan, each rising by 2,000 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals totaled 5,752 piculs.

Edible Oil: Prices are rising without end. Due to the easing of the money market, cargo owners are very reluctant to sell. Gold prices are rising, and retail investors are very eager to buy. Soybean oil opened at 230,000 yuan, immediately rising to 240,000 yuan, reaching a high of 247,000 yuan, and closing at 244,000 yuan, an increase of 27,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rose by 22,000 yuan, each rising by more than 10%. Jitou rapeseed oil was priced at 335,000 yuan, also rising by more than 10%. Soybean cake rose by 2,000 yuan.

Flour: The market is greatly affected by the easing of the money market. Northern merchants are vigorously taking in goods. Prices of various goods outside the circle are soaring, and sentiment is firm. Cargo owners are doing their best to raise prices. Old cars rose to 22,100 yuan, and warships broke through the 20,000 yuan mark, with the final transaction at 21,250 yuan, an increase of more than 1,000 yuan compared to last Saturday.

Miscellaneous Grains: The upward trend continues. Soybeans jumped by 3,000-5,000 yuan due to the sharp rise in oil cake. Raw peanuts are in extremely short supply, and cargo owners are holding on to them, increasing prices by more than 20%. Sesame seeds are in strong demand in the local market, with a general increase of 10% to 20%. Red beans rose by 10%. Corn alone declined by 2,000 yuan due to sluggish sales.

### Afternoon Market Suddenly Reverses; Chinese Stocks Initially Firm but Later Weakened

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese stock market showed a trend of initial firmness followed by weakness yesterday. The money market remained loose, and hidden interest rates within the industry declined. Initially, due to the flatness and weakness of the gold and currency markets, outside speculative funds returned, and buying interest suddenly increased, causing the market to be firm in the first half of the day. Later, news came that the Central Bank was selling gold and silver without any movement. Market sentiment in gold and currency rose, and stock market sentiment weakened again. Speculative funds within the circle entered and then exited. Selling interest on the surface increased, and short sellers frequently applied pressure, causing sentiment to soften. The afternoon market still closed at a low price.

Yong Yarn's morning opening was buoyed by the favorable trend of gold weakness and stock strength. The initial opening was at 7.3 yuan. There was much profit-taking, falling slightly to 7.28 yuan. Securities firms sold gold and bought stocks, rising again to 7.51 yuan. Later, financial firms turned from long to short, and the market showed weakness again, falling to 7.38 yuan. Guangdong merchants took in goods again, rising to 7.58 yuan. Large investors sold off in unison, falling slightly to 7.33 yuan. Afterwards, it hovered around 7.45 and 7.48 yuan. Near noon, due to the sharp rise in cotton yarn, yarn merchants sold again, and the market surface was filled with selling pressure, causing the market to plunge straight down to a low of 7.15 yuan, eventually closing at 7.28 yuan in the afternoon.

Small and medium-sized stocks showed a strong opening in the morning. After the opening, retail investors' appetite was still smooth, and the trend was not bad. Meiya rose to a high of 2.17 yuan, Xinyi rose to a high of 1.85 yuan, Tongyi reached 2.70 yuan, Jingfu 0.295 yuan, Lianglun 1.60 yuan. Those that hit the limit up included Qinxing 0.38 yuan, Xinguang 0.67 yuan, Lian 0.18 yuan, NeiYi 0.20 yuan, and Yonggong 1.92 yuan, totaling five types. Cotton yarn was close to the limit, and the afternoon market still declined.

### Foreign Stocks and Gold Bonds Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the foreign stock market was affected by the rise in the black market exchange rate of the US dollar. At the same time, the money market tended to ease, Guangdong merchants searched quite earnestly, and foreign merchants' appetite was particularly strong. The morning opening of various stocks was quite quiet. Yisha initially called 15,800 yuan, then rose to 16,300 and 16,500 yuan to close at 16,100 and 16,300 yuan. Jardine Matheson: 60,000, 62,000. British American Tobacco: 22,000, 23,000. Asia: 1,500, 1,550. The average increase was half a percent.

The morning opening of gold bonds was spirited. The middle market, for a while, rose to the price limit. It initially started calling 250,000 and went all the way up to 350,000 in the afternoon.

### Gold Mediocre

[Report from Our Newspaper] Gold market conditions were ordinary yesterday. The morning market was weak and hovered. The afternoon market clearly rose and fell while including interest. It was heard that the gold and silver market would officially open today and the Central Bank would strengthen control. Therefore, the sentiment in the industry was quite uneasy.

Yesterday, the money market was still loose and the hidden interest rates were also low. However, the bulls were afraid of being suppressed and took a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the quality of buying was light and speculative funds in the industry went elsewhere, causing the transactions to be slow. In the morning, the money market was flexible and each group thought about purchasing, but also worried that the Central Bank would sell halfway through, so the general sentiment was average. The market initially called 533, 538. After the opening, overnight bulls finished selling, and the market went down a level. The shorts took it in and raised it to 540, 543. After the high, the overall sentiment was quite soft and the appetite for taking in goods was not strong, so the market showed a decline, to 538, 541. The market had mild ups and downs and hovered at around 540, and its movements showed no major impact.

After that, the money market became even looser, and the daily interest rate fell to 55 yuan, but no one would take it. Furthermore, because the Hong Kong exchange rate was falling, the overall trend suddenly became firm and the purchase intentions turned strong. The market rose gradually to 551, 554. After the high, the news of the Central Bankâs sale came and the selling momentum started again, and the new shorts became active and it fell back to 543, 546, and even as low as 542.5. After the morning, it decreased slightly to 541.3, and then near noon it started rising and then closed at 545, 548 in the afternoon.

In the afternoon, the opening was supported by the bulls, with a price of 578, 583. After the opening it fell slightly to 574, 577. After the slight decrease, people were unwilling and the overall scene was then pushed up, and the price then went up again to 580, 583. Afterwards, there were reports of a tight money market, and the hidden virtue pushed up to seven jiao with demand. It was even heard that the Central Bank was secretly throwing gold to tighten the money market, and then sentiment turned weak. New selling on the surface never stopped. The market went all the way low, falling to 571.4, and softening again near the close, closing in the evening at 570, 573.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Falls Again

The Hong Kong exchange rate opened at four jiao and four fen per thousand yuan this morning, closing at four jiao and seven-and-a-half fen last night. The Gold Yuan opened at seven jiao and three fen this morning, closing at seven jiao and four fen last night.

Hong Kong gold opened at 310 yuan per Hong Kong tael this morning, closing at 309 yuan and five fen last night. The US dollar telegraphic transfer opened at 5.25 yuan this morning, closing at the same price last night. The US dollar term bill opened at five yuan, two jiao, three fen this morning, closing at five yuan, two jiao, two fen last night. The US dollar opened at five yuan, two jiao, one fen this morning, closing at the same price last night.

US Dollar: Yesterday the market was mostly calm. The morning opening was 10,700 yuan, 10,800 yuan. It once reached a high of 11,200 yuan, 11,650 yuan, and closed in the evening at 11,400 yuan, 11,500 yuan.

### Relaxation of Cash Withdrawal Restrictions

Solving the Cash Shortage and Suspending the Issuance of Silver Dollars

[Report from Our Newspaper] The cash panic situation has slightly improved since yesterday, but the trend has not been completely resolved. The Central Bank yesterday changed its policy for banks to issue 10% of their deposit amount as cash every other day. The issuance of silver dollars has been temporarily suspended. In exceptional circumstances, the 10% limit for loosening cash can be negotiated on a case-by-case basis according to actual needs. Yesterday, it was estimated that about 2 billion yuan worth of 500 yuan banknotes were issued. Rumors that a large number of large banknotes were released were untrue.

### The Export Control Committee Promotes Increased Production

Production Equipment Can Be Approved as Appropriate

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to information from the Export Control Committee: In order to adapt to the environment and adjust to the needs of manufacturers, the Committee will consider and approve applications from factories for "new additions and expansions of equipment". Production equipment essential to people's livelihood can be approved as appropriate to promote construction and increase production.

### A Stroll Through the Market: Onlookers

The Gold and Silver Market is Beneficial Without Being Wasteful; Gold Bonds Start to Play a Role; a Turning Point in the Stock Market's Future

For the past twelve years, gold and silver trading has almost never completely stopped for even a day. Therefore, the opening of the gold and silver market today only indicates: (1) the black market becomes the open market; (2) the illegal becomes legal; (3) the scattered and unorganized becomes centralized and organized.

These three meanings can be said to be the unified spirit of all the recent measures taken by the financial authorities, and can also be said to be very Confucian and Mencian.

Ran Qiu asked Confucius, "What is 'beneficial without being wasteful'?"

Confucius said, "To benefit the people according to what they find beneficial, is that not beneficial without being wasteful?"

That is to say, if the people think something is beneficial, the government should allow them to do it. If the people benefit, the government also benefits. Isn't that beneficial without being wasteful?

The current financial authorities have deeply grasped the essence of Confucianism. Underground money houses and black market interest rates are what people find beneficial, so the government opens them up. Gold and currency transactions are busy in the black market, which is what the people find beneficial, so the government opens them up. All such things are the implementation of Confucian and Mencian philosophy, and who can say it is not appropriate!

Gold and silver trading has gone from illegal to legal, and from scattered to centralized. From now on, there will be a bright future.

To what extent will this future be? First of all, it must be understood that all three hundred and sixty industries are trending towards an equilibrium of profits. From this point of view, the future progress and retreat of the gold and silver market is most likely to save the stock market.

The stock market in the past week can be said to have had bad luck. From today onwards, it will be easy to support each other and sing in harmony.

Some say: In the past, there have been markets such as cloth, so the stock market is not alone. However, when actual sales are smooth, cloth does have the function of assisting the stock market. The situation has changed slightly in the past week, and the capital required for cloth is also large, while gold and silver transactions use one tael as a unit, which is easy and convenient. Therefore, it is much more convenient to carry the stock market than with cloth, etc.

The most readily available thing for the gold and silver market and the stock market to support each other is gold bonds.

Gold bonds have been listed for sale until today, and have been in a state of decline. From now on, the daily hedging of gold bonds may be realized.

The authorities may have two thoughts about the daily hedging of gold bonds: (1) Sales are effective; (2) Controlling the gold and silver market also has a handle.

If you don't believe it, let's look at the new changes in the next week or two: (1) Gold bonds may replace the deflated foreign exchange transfer certificates as a tool for buying and selling. (2) The five jiao daily interest rate base may produce a "formula" market interest rate in the daily hedging of gold bonds to adjust the situation.

There is no need to say more to those with discerning eyes.

Now, what ordinary people are concerned about is what role will the opening of the gold and silver market have on prices and the value of silver dollars? First of all, of course, is that the tide will rise with the boat. Secondly, the price of silver dollars on the street will not diverge too much. Gold Bonds Start to Play a Role; a Turning Point in the Stock Market's Future

### Cotton Yarn Market Firm and Strong; Cloth Market Inflation Spreads Again

Cotton yarn is uniformly firm and buoyant, as loose credit is widespread. There are many bullish operators in the same industry. The Guangdong operators are still thinking of making progress, and the reproduction industry is eager to acquire the finer yarn. Retail investors also take in a quantity when prices are low. The market price is trending towards steadiness and strength. As a result, the prices of various yarns have generally increased by about 10%.

42-count Blue Phoenix Yarn was traded from 3.7 million yuan to 3.8 million yuan at the closing, up 400,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix was up 360,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon finally closed up 250,000 yuan, ending at 2.63 million yuan.

21-count Double Horse Yarn spot goods initially opened at 1.89 million yuan and once neared the mark of breaking 2 million. The price then receded to 1.94 million yuan at the close, with the long investors profiting and selling, eventually rising by 180,000 yuan. Factory invoices for spot goods receded by 10,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 1.86 million yuan, an increase of 180,000 yuan compared to the weekend. 16-count and 10-count also rose steadily, frequently reaching unprecedented highs.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market trended towards higher levels across the board, as the money market on the market was still loose, and people's mood was showing excitement. Therefore, local stores were still eager to replenish their stock, and customers also touched the goods slightly. Those speculating in the market also took a bullish view afterwards and adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

The leading fine cloth was quiet and tight, and trading was scarce. It was initially called 77,500 yuan in the morning, and after hearing that the yarn market was reporting an increase, it was raised to 86,000 yuan. The afternoon market receded slightly to 84,000 yuan, a final increase of 14,500 yuan compared to the end of the past period. Trumpet Boy fine cloth also rose by 10,000 yuan. In addition, fine cloths of various grades generally increased by 5,000 to 12,000 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened at 73,300 yuan, then fell to 71,900 yuan, and turned to steadiness near the close, reaching a high of 76,800 yuan, and finally closed at 75,800 yuan, an increase of 11,000 yuan. The afternoon market once rose to 80,500 yuan. Around 2 o'clock, it went down to 79,300 yuan, and the 190 high-grade Ten Forest reached 150,000 yuan.

### China Textile Sells Yarn

[Report from Our Newspaper] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn to the reproduction industry as usual yesterday, opening five types and selling a total of 177 pieces to 64 households, with a value of 56.647 million yuan.

Prices of various yarns: 15-count Fengnian 1.58 million yuan, 21-count Xiantao Grade 2 1.78 million yuan, 32-count Riguang 2.55 million yuan, 40-count Hongshi Guang 3.6 million yuan, 42-count Double Strand Liuma 3.75 million yuan.

### Gold Bond Fund Custody Committee Holds Second Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper] The 38th Year Gold Short-Term Public Bond Fund Committee held its second committee meeting at the Central Bank at 4:00 PM yesterday. Liu Gongyun, Chen Bingzhang, Wang Yansong, Guan Chuangneng, Zhuang Zhihuan, etc. attended, with Fu Rulin presiding. After discussion, two key cases were passed: (1) Former Standing Committee member Xu Guomao, the representative of the National Silver Union, could not take care of his duties due to his busy schedule. The Silver Union changed its representative to Wang Yansong to participate and fill the vacancy of Standing Committee member, which should be approved. (2) The Gold Custody Rules, Rules of Procedure, and Committee Meeting Rules were approved.

### Discount Committee Stipulations: Supplementary Measures for Industrial Loans

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discount Committee held its 31st regular meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Liu Gongyun. As a result of the discussion, 21 transportation, public utility, and industrial and mining production business loans were approved. In addition, two supplementary regulations for industrial loans in the Shanghai area were stipulated: (1) Manufacturers who have already been approved for loans must not apply for additional loans under any pretext before the loan expires. (2) Those whose original loans have expired and both principal and interest have been paid off may apply for loans again, and the original review standards shall still be used for separate review and actual lending.

### Silk Soars

Yesterday, the money market for artificial silk showed a trend of loosening, and yarn and cloth outside the circle rose together, and people's mood was excited.

120 Bridge Morning opened at 3.3 million yuan, and after opening, the buying interest was still strong, rising to 3.4 million yuan. After the high, it was heard that the gold price had turned weak, the acceptance became flat, and the market turned soft. Near noon, the circle slightly decreased to 3.36 million yuan, and the next-day position was 2.52 million yuan.

The trend of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk was sharp, and the public sentiment was excited. Because of the tendency of the monetary machine to loosen, the supply of funds became smooth, and the market rose.

The Morning opened at 3.4 million yuan, and then called 3.5 million yuan. The local market still had a strong appetite, and the market was generally rising. It was found that the high point was 3.83 million yuan, and the market turned weak after hearing that the Foreign Exchange market and the stock market were weakening. The trend of the market decreased and stopped the sell-out in time.

Because raw materials were rising, silk and silk were also in short supply, and the industry saw some fluctuations. The sales from the customers were big, the public sentiment was still active, and a closing was made at 1.65 million yuan.

### Tung Oil Rises at Close

Yesterday's tung oil market saw a trend where holders increased their offering price, since they felt that all goods were tending to follow a rise led by gold and the American dollar, and so the costs were forced to increase by degrees. At close, the market had risen from 5,000 to as much as 10,000 yuan per share. The trade was not vigorous, since international trends were still weak. New York oil was selling for only one jiao and six fen, and so the profits did not seem very favorable. Domestic sales are also lackluster, so the buying power is lackluster.

### Sales for Export Tea are Low

The Zhen Zhen and Jen Yuan export green teas are very highly regarded by North Africa under French rule. Even though Yongxing and Jinlong Trading Companies tried to increase sales last week, because the merchants fought hard they did not succeed. The market was slow at first, since buying and selling were hard. Because of liquidity issues, trading picked up around noon. It has only been sporadic at most. As for prices, because of the price the transfers and foreign exchange accounts are at the prices are good, domestic trades are normal.

### US Troops Ordered to Transfer; Basketball League Ends Early; Two Exciting A Group Games Tonight

[Report from our newspaper] The basketball league schedule tonight has been slightly adjusted. Due to the US Marine Corps and the US ship "Pfeiffer" being ordered to transfer and scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of this month, the McClains and Pfeiffer teams requested that the remaining league games be held earlier. The Basketball Committee has approved their request. In addition to rescheduling all of the A Group 1 games, the original Shanghai Police vs. Hai Qing game scheduled for tonight has been changed to McClains vs. Encas, while the Ren Yu vs. Hui Li game remains unchanged. The McClains team has made rapid progress in their skills, while Encas is a strong team from the Western Qing area. The two teams will clash head-on with equal strength, making it a very exciting game. Ren Yu is full of vigor, and Hui Li is also a fast-paced team, truly a match of equals, making it difficult to predict the outcome. Tickets are 500 yuan for the balcony, 1,000 yuan for the lower level, and 1,500 yuan for reserved seats. The schedule is as follows:

US WeatherâPeier (Group 2C) 5:30 PM Referee: Huang Yourui, Wen Zongyuan

McClainsâEncas (Group 1 Supplementary) 6:30 PM Referee: Jin Patao, Liu Hesheng

Ren YuâHui Li (Group 1) 7:30 PM Referee: Wang Lidao, Wu Shijian

The Group 2C section will begin first, with US Weather facing Peier. The foreign soldiers in that section have won all three games, making them the strongest contenders for the championship. Although the team captain, Bo Tousheng, has been promoted to the A Group 1 Encas team, their strength remains formidable. Peier has won two and lost one of their three games, and their lineup is quite complete, with Shen Bizhang, Wu Shijian, Yu Erjia, and the Hu brothers, all of whom are renowned players. There will be a fierce battle with US Weather at that time. In Group 1, McClains and Encas will meet again. This is a supplementary game for the second round. This game was originally scheduled for the previous week, but both teams requested a postponement to participate in the Navy YMCA boxing finals. McClains and Encas are both strong foreign soldier teams. In their first meeting, the McClains team was defeated. This time, the McClains team will go all out to seek revenge. However, Encas has strong players such as Buli Libotuo and Gebeng Qigu Fu, and with Bo Tousheng's assistance, they are even more formidable. Therefore, they were able to defeat the Shanghai Police and Hui Li in the second round. Whether McClains can escape this fate remains to be seen in the outcome of the game.

The final game is between Ren Yu and Hui Li. Ren Yu has been in excellent form recently, and their fighting spirit is particularly strong. In the second round, they defeated the three foreign soldier teams of Encas, McClains, and Hai Qing, leaving them in ruins. Their momentum is high and they are invincible. Apart from the Hua Lian team, they are the only team with a chance to seize the throne. Therefore, the entire army is in high spirits and full of ambition. However, whether Wu Xinyun can play due to his foot injury is a problem, which will inevitably have some impact on their strength. Since the return of Ye Chen, Hui Li has benefited from the complementary effect of the "peony and green leaves". Their "fast-paced" style often leads to thrilling and suspenseful performances. The three musketeers, Yongfang, Fuhai, and Zhiji, are all capable of scoring. Wei Xu has been in particularly good form recently. In order to win and avenge their shame from the first round, they will definitely go all out and fight Ren Yu to the finish.

### Rescheduled Schedule

### Hong Kong Football Report

[Hong Kong News] Last Saturday's Hong Kong Football League had a total of three games. First, let's look at the results:

South China South Defeats Eastern Association 3-0

Kitchee Association Defeats St. Joseph's 4-1

Bus Team Defeats Kwong Wah Association 7-2

Eastern's Loan Players Inevitably Score No Goals

The results of this "Southeast" battle show us: (1) Eastern spared no expense in transferring three famous Portuguese players from Macau and Lu Hanchen, a brave and skilled player, to strengthen their lineup, clearly with the ambition to defeat the "Victory Army". At the very least, they attached great importance to this game. (2) Eastern's combat strength has obviously doubled, their fighting spirit is also quite strong, and the entire army has performed above par. Mai Xigao's defense and offense were appropriate, Lu Hanchen's looking ahead and behind, and Liang Dingtang, even though his hand injury had not fully recovered, was still as steady as ever, all of which were "remarkable". It's a pity that the Portuguese players and the brave players rarely cooperate, so the communication is not very skilled and they often miss opportunities. From this, we can see that although the outcome of a football game requires attention to individual skills, the success of the team's communication and strategic use cannot be ignored. (3) Although Eastern lost this game, the audience's evaluation of them was high. It was only because South China South also went all out to deal with them and did not relax at all, achieving a performance above par, that they had to lose. Seeing South China's defense and offense in one go, like mercury pouring to the ground, seeping in everywhere, Feng Ershu's steady command, and Zhu Yongqiang's activity, all were fatal threats to Eastern's defense. Rong Sheng, Jin Hai, Jin Hong, and Song Sheng's encircling and intercepting formed an unbreakable golden city, making the Eastern forwards, who lacked tacit cooperation, feel like they couldn't move an inch. Yu Yaode's two saves further prevented Eastern from breaking the egg. The 3-0 result was really the achievement of skill, not a lucky win.

Kwong Wah Youngsters Thrive Before Declining

The Bus team's performance on this day was not ideal. In the first half, they relied on the advantage of the tailwind to besiege for ten minutes, but they still couldn't open the scoring. It was only after the Kwong Wah youngsters marched against the wind and scored one goal that the Bus team's morale was boosted. Dahui and Chunfa switched positions, and the situation improved greatly. A series of offensives led to the capture of several cities, which laid the foundation for victory.

The God of Wind Dominates; Kitchee Wins

Kitchee faced St. Joseph's. Due to the strong sea breeze, both sides relied on it as an advantage to score points. In the first half, St. Joseph's took a 1-0 lead with the help of the God of Wind. Kitchee then turned the tables in the second half with a 4-0 victory.

The entire game was divided into two stages by the mischief of the God of Wind, that is, only two halves of offensive and defensive battles. It can be seen that Kitchee's defense and offense were, on average, better than St. Joseph's by one level. In the first half, they were able to operate step by step in a defensive position, struggling hard, and only lost one goal, which laid a valuable foundation for the entire team. In the second half, they were able to launch a full-scale offensive. St. Joseph's rarely launched counterattacks, and at the same time, their defenders were less skilled, so Guo Yingqi and Yao Zhuoran were able to get whatever they wanted and overcome them by a large score of 4-1.

### Detailed Report of the Governor's Cup Full Game

[Hong Kong News, 21st] In the Governor's Cup game between Wah Luen and Western, Western took the offensive at the beginning, but it was only a flash in the pan and was repeatedly attacked by Wah Luen. But at that time, connoisseurs had already seen that Dahui was far below par. He repeatedly tried to dribble close to the baseline, wanting to cross but instead kicking the ball out of bounds. When he tried to cross for the third time, he was slightly injured in the foot because of Luo Cha's resistance. This may be the reason why he didn't perform well in the whole game yesterday, and it's not certain, but looking at his running style afterwards, it seems that the injury was not serious, but he was unable to perform his previous skills yesterday.

Within the first five minutes, although Wah Luen attacked more than defended, they were forced into a corner kick by Western once. At eight minutes, Mei Wu blindly charged at the goal and collided with Liang De, who was holding the ball in his hands. Although he himself broke his head and had to leave the field to put on a bandage to stop the bleeding, he was still penalized with a free kick. From this, it can be seen that the person's experience is limited, but he relies on his courage and speed. Yesterday, he happened to have the god of luck descending upon him, so he was lucky enough to score two goals. I don't see anything outstanding about him.

Mei Wu Shows Off His Skills

At ten minutes, Jialing suddenly shot hard, and Liang De saved the danger, but he continued to lose two corner kicks. Once, Zhu Zai headed the ball high on the left. Once, Li Dahui suddenly entered the center and angrily shot from 25 yards, but it was blocked by An Dachen into a corner kick. At about 15 minutes, Wu Lun crossed the ball, and Hou Lu rushed in for a shot, but Wu Lun was offside first, so it couldn't be counted. Jialing suddenly went to the left wing position, dribbled the ball straight up, and crossed it horizontally near the baseline. When the ball crossed in front of the goal, Siweia was there to receive it and quickly passed it to the front of the goal. At that time, Mei Wu changed to the central open position, and the ball just happened to arrive, so he shot into the goal from close range, scoring the first point.

After Wah Luen lost this goal, they immediately switched Chunfa and Zhu Yongqiang's positions. Not long after, Dahui had a chance to shoot, but it was again blocked by An Dachen into a corner kick. The ball came to Wenzhi, who ordered Chunfa to shoot, but it became a high-angle shot. At 36 minutes, Mei Wu dribbled the ball deep, and Hou Rongsheng tried hard to resist, already entangled near the baseline. At that time, Rongsheng originally wanted to kick the ball against Mei Wu's foot to make it bounce out of bounds for a goal kick, but although the ball hit Mei Wu, it rolled diagonally without crossing the boundary. Mei Wu took the opportunity to raise his foot and swipe it horizontally, and it was as if he had divine help. The ball he shot flew diagonally into the Wah Luen goal. The ball flew into the net diagonally along the right post. Because of the oblique angle and the speed of its arrival, Liang De was unable to save it. Wah Luen lost the second goal.

Wah Luen Changes Formation

Seeing that the defense had weaknesses, Wah Luen urgently changed Xie Jinhong to the central defender, Miao Zai to the east left back, and Zhang Jinhai to the front line to lead the attack. Li Chunfa changed to the left center back. However, because the trend had already been established, there was no way to reverse the defeat for a while. At 42 minutes, in the course of Si Lu's intrusion into the hinterland, Xie Jinhong and Hou Rongsheng cooperated to entangle him, joining forces to sandwich him in the center, so that they rolled into a ball and fell to the ground together. The referee then awarded Wah Luen a penalty kick. The ball was kicked by Wu Lun, but because he kicked it too off to the side, it only hit the right post of the goal and did not go in. So in the first half, Wah Luen only lost two goals, which was considered a blessing in disguise.

When the second half started again, the Western lineup remained the same. Wah Luen's new lineup was as follows:

Yu Yaode Miao Changrong Hou Rongsheng Liu Songsheng Xie Jinhong Li Chunfa Li Dahui Zou Wenzhi Zhang Jinhai Feng Jingxiang Zhu Yongqiang

At this time, Wah Luen adjusted its lineup, which was obviously better than the first half. But after only two minutes of the game, Li Dahui angrily shot into the goal. When An Dachen held the ball, Zhang Jinhai had already rushed to him. An Dachen was afraid of losing the ball, so he patted the ball to avoid it, but Zhang also chased after him, blocking him in front and preventing him from kicking the ball out. Qi Liqi saw this and suddenly burst into anger, rushing behind Zhang and hitting him hard. Although Zhang fell to the ground, the penalty kick had been awarded. This ball was still taken by the "Desperate Saburo," who executed it with one stroke of the knife, and Wah Luen regained a 2-1 situation.

Reversal Missed

Since they had regained a taste of sweetness, Wah Luen's prestige was even more dazzling. Once, Zhu Yongqiang crossed the ball, and the Wah Luen troops advanced towards the goal, but it was finally pushed out by An Dachen. However, Wah Luen's prestige was too great at that time, and at 15 minutes, Feng Jingxiang made a wonderful shot and scored a goal, making it a 2-2 tie. For a moment, the spectators cheered, thinking that Wah Luen had this, then victory was expected.

Unexpectedly, three minutes later, Siweia had a chance on the periphery and angrily scored a goal. Although Miao Changrong tried hard to entangle him by running, he was unable to get the position and was still cut in for a shot. The ball was very fast, and although Liang De reached out to touch the ball, it still slid into the net, so Western took the lead again. After that, Zhang Jinhai injured his foot and lost his ability to charge at the goal, so Wah Luen was unable to win again. There were still two things worth recording after that. One was that the football exploded at 31 minutes, and the other was that Hou Ziyuan came out to cross the ball. Although Zhang Jinhai was injured in the foot, he still struggled to rush up, threatening An Dachen so that he could only leave the goal and rush forward, hurriedly pushing the ball out. The ball was obtained by Feng Ershu, who immediately lobbed an empty goal. Unfortunately, the momentum was slightly poor and it did not fall directly into the goal but fell on the top of the net. Otherwise, this could have been a chance to reverse the defeat, because if the game was extended, Wah Luen might not have been able to finally beat the drum of victory, which is a pity.

### Hong Kong Chinese League Painfully Loses Governor's Cup: Feng Jingxiang Unmatched Among Peers; Xiao Miao Unstable; Da Hui Out of Form

[Hong Kong 21st Dispatch] In this year's Governor's Cup, the Western League team of the Football Association unjustly defeated several Chinese players yesterday due to their inexplicable performance. Although the Chinese team has already secured the finals for this season's Special Silver Shield, and the league championship and runner-up awards are practically guaranteed for Chinese players, and the Memorial Cup is expected to be ours, the fact that the Chinese League team, with such talented players, lost the Governor's Cup is more than just a minor imperfection. Having suffered a humiliating 6-1 defeat the first time, losing the final match again yesterday can be considered a great disgrace.

Considering our lineup yesterday, we had eight national team players, which is already a formidable organization in Hong Kong. Furthermore, comparing each player individually or assessing the entire team's skills, the opposing team was no match for our heroes. Therefore, we had no reason to lose our prestige. However, after 23 minutes of the game, Chia-neng suddenly showed off his cleverness, dribbling up from the left wing position, disrupting the steps of our defenders and allowing him to calmly pass the ball across the goal, ultimately allowing Meigo, who had moved to the center, to score first. Then, in the 36th minute of the first half, Hou Zi, who is usually so adept at making swift clearances, acted like an old woman trying to act young, fumbling with fancy moves on the baseline while facing the extremely threatening Meigo. As a result, he lost another goal in that person's miraculous shot. Afterwards, although the generals exerted themselves in the second half and managed to tie the score 2-2 within 15 minutes, Miao Changrong ultimately lacked experience. At that time, Silva gained possession and advanced quickly, and Xiao Miao was fiercely chasing and pressing, holding the line. However, because he didn't position himself correctly, Silva managed to flick the ball in, miraculously scoring again. Thus, the opponents leisurely accepted the Governor's Cup from the hands of Governor Sir Alexander Grantham, their faces beaming with joy. This is truly something that makes Chinese fans feel suffocated.

Association Chinese League:

Xie Jinhong (South China), Yu Yaode (South China), Hou Zhasheng (South China), Liu Songsheng (South China), Miao Changrong (Chinese), Zhang Jinhai (South China), Li Dahui (Bus), Zou Wenzhi (Bus), Zhu Yongqiang (South China), Li Chunfa (Bus), Feng Jingxiang (South China)

Association Western League:

Dosha (Navy), Anderson (Army), Luo Cha (Joseph), Qi Liqi (Army), Li Annar (Joseph), Luo Bianchen (Army), Meigo (Hong Kong), Chia-neng (Hong Kong), Hou Lu (Police), Wu Lun (Hong Kong), Silva (Joseph)

Miao Changrong is a rising young player with little experience in big games, so it's not surprising that he didn't perform up to par in such an occasion. The most surprising thing is that the two best center backs in Hong Kong, who were as lively as dragons and tigers after the game against Eastern the other day, were completely out of form yesterday. Xie Jinhong, returning to the left back position this time, couldn't find the same form as he usually has as the center back for South China. The most unfortunate thing is that Li Dahui was too out of form, not only completely lacking the ability to cut in and shoot, but also his powerful crosses were not up to par. I believe it's because he usually plays too much small-sided football. I always say that small-sided football can only be used as an introductory path to practicing big football. Once you play well in the big football circle, you shouldn't engage in small-sided football anymore, otherwise it will be more harmful than beneficial. The reason is that small-sided football and big football have different weights, the fields are different sizes, and the force used when kicking is different. Big football players being distracted by small-sided football will lead to the degradation of big football skills. Considering the "almost there but not quite" nature of Dahui's crosses yesterday, I dare to assert that he is harming himself by playing too much small-sided football.

My frank words are naturally a way of holding the virtuous accountable, which stems from deep love and unintentional bluntness. Looking at the bigger picture, although the Chinese League unfortunately lost, the fighting spirit in the second half and the quick wit to change the lineup when things seemed unfavorable are worthy of praise. The old Feng Jingxiang is still strong and plays with great skill, not only scoring the tying goal but also fighting bravely, which is truly admirable. Honestly speaking, Zhang Jinhai's center back play is good, but he is ultimately better as a striker than a center back. If he hadn't injured his foot after switching to center forward yesterday, I believe he would have turned the tide with his sprinting ability. In the second half, the entire national team forward line was brought on, but they still couldn't salvage the defeat. What else can be said?

Objectively speaking, yesterday's game wasn't that the opponents played well, but that we played badly. The loss was too undeserved. However, I must specially point out and praise some of the opponent's key players. Li Annar, the center back, knows the Chinese style of play well, and he himself is brave and physically imposing, making him a strong opponent for our Chinese team. Chia-neng is undoubtedly the best left winger in Hong Kong. The most unexpected thing was the agility of Hong Kong Club's Meigo, which was truly beyond our expectations. Although both of his goals seemed to have an element of luck, his ability to succeed in luck was due to his daring and willingness to act, and not easily letting go of good opportunities. Also, the sudden improvement in the performance of the two Portuguese players, Silva and Luo Cha, is worthy of praise. They also have their own way of deserving victory.

### Knife Fish Noodles

â Chen Yixian

Feng Xuan, as a retainer in Lord Mengchang's household, sang loudly, "Let's go home with my long sword!" The first verse was about the lack of fish in the diet. The second course of a Western meal is always fish, and sophisticated diners even have silver knives for eating fish. It can be seen that whether Chinese or foreigners, fish is always a necessary part of a meal. Now that the peach blossoms are beginning to bloom, knife fish are on the market, and I will talk a little about knife fish noodles.

Knife fish is the earliest fish of the year, with the freshest taste and the most bones, so ordinary families do not prepare this dish. Last February, I went to Yangzhou on business and passed through Zhenjiang, where a friend invited me to morning tea. People in the Yangzhou and Zhenjiang area start their breakfast with a pot of tea, followed by wine, braised pork, dried bean curd threads, and then steamed buns, dumplings, and noodles. Braised pork is eaten with vinegar-soaked ginger shreds, which is naturally a specialty of Zhenjiang, but their knife fish noodles are unique to this area. The host specifically instructed the waiter to make them "thin noodles with ample soup." When the noodles arrived, there was a bowl of thick soup, and only after eating halfway did I see a small amount of noodles, which tasted extremely fresh and had no fish bones. My friend said that knife fish noodles must be eaten in February, because even though this fish is still available in the market before Qingming in March, it is no longer valued.

Chicken, duck, pork, and beef are available all year round, but fish have their seasons. For example, knife fish are available when peach blossoms bloom, pufferfish when willow catkins are in the air, tu fu fish (also known as yellow croaker) when rapeseed flowers bloom, shad during the beginning of summer, yellow eel is best in early summer, and its taste and quality deteriorate after the Summer Solstice, while perch is best during frost descent. Each fish has its unique beauty, such as the liver of perch, the belly of shad, the head of catfish, the tongue of crucian carp and a piece of the back under the head, the flower of mandarin fish, the fin of pomfret, and the swimming bladder and white flesh in the belly of grass carp, which only gourmets can appreciate.

### The Tragedy of the Middle Ground

â Xiao Feng

In this day and age, it's really not easy to speak. If you lean too far to the left, you'll be labeled a "communist bandit," and if you lean too far to the right, you'll be labeled "stubborn" and "reactionary." Perhaps being a non-leftist, non-rightist centrist should allow you to please both sides. However, that's not the case. If you're not careful, you'll be criticized for being "opportunistic" or "sycophantic."

Having read the three articles recently published by Mr. Liang Shuming, he presents himself as an impartial peacemaker, holding the Nationalist Party fully responsible for the war while also demanding that "the Communist Party should announce that the three years of fighting were a last resort, and express deep remorse for the damage caused to the country and the people." Although it's a bit contradictory, it's necessary to appear as an "impartial person outside the Nationalists and Communists." Unfortunately, Mr. Liang's masterpiece didn't win applause, but rather drew jeers. Several publications on the left, such as "Zhongjian" and "Xin Shidai," launched a siege with titles like "Questioning Liang Shuming," "Reprimanding Liang Shuming," and "Liang Shuming's Political Illusions." The publication on the right, "Xin Xiwang," also expressed opposition, arguing that "it seems as if this war was entirely a one-man show by the Nationalist Party, and the Communist Party didn't even climb onto the stage, which is difficult to accept." They unanimously considered Mr. Liang's invented "posthumous conferment method" to be a very ridiculous approach. Even Mr. Liang, who is skilled at observing the situation and trying to please everyone, couldn't avoid being attacked from both sides. No wonder the great liberal master "crossed the river soldier" Hu Shi has remained silent since flying south, truly a wise man who understands the times.

During the Political Consultative Conference, because both the Nationalists and Communists were vying for the support of centrists, small parties and social elites who sought survival in the cracks enjoyed a moment of great popularity, with the pleasure of pleasing both sides. With the changes in the political situation, centrists have either joined Yang Zhu or Mo Di, and are feeling the pain of "it's difficult to please both sides" and "displeasing everyone."

The late Japanese professor Rongjiro Kawai put it well: "We who fight against conservative reactionaries on the right and support oppressed ideas, and who fight against materialistic Marxist ideas on the left, are considered the same as Marxists by the right and the same as conservatives by the left. We may be attacked from both sides, but this is precisely where the unique mission of liberalism lies, and the valuable task that liberalism should undertake." These words truly express the sorrow and anger of a centrist.

### Peaceful Resolution

â Wang Deyun

I have been working in a law firm for many years, so I have some contact with various lawsuits and case proceedings. I am busy all day writing about defendants and plaintiffs, and life is almost as stereotyped as "in accordance with the above." I don't seem to be very interested in law, but I often pay attention to the clients of various levels who patronize the firm. The clients are quite diverse: workers, merchants, scholars, officials, rickshaw pullers... almost everything is included. They almost always talk to the lawyer with tense faces, anxiously and agitatedly. This impression often makes me think: there are so many disputes between people.

Of course, some cases seem to require resorting to law. But there are also some cases that are not a big deal, and can be resolved peacefully, but people often don't think of this shortcut, and just act emotionally. In fact, the gains from reconciliation are always more satisfactory than the outcome of litigation, which is undeniable. Even lawyers do not hope to litigate, and often mediate from the middle, hoping to resolve the matter and "turn swords into plowshares."

Of course, the more advanced civilization is and the more complex the social environment, the more conflicts and conflicts of interest between people increase, which seems to be inevitable. However, unwise behaviors caused by disputes often lead to both sides being injured and irreparable. Therefore, the best buffer for disputes is to seek a peaceful solution. This is true not only for private individuals and groups, but also, in a broader sense, even for wars between countries and friction and cold wars between nations.

### Flyer Company

â Mao Yi

In England, there is a company that specializes in distributing flyers on behalf of advertising companies, manufacturers, or other individuals. Large-scale "flyer companies" even have the names and addresses of one hundred million people from all over the world. One of them was founded by Einstein's nephew, who fled to England on the day Hitler seized power, with only a five-pound note in his pocket. Within six years, he became a big boss employing 250 people.

Any client can entrust the flyer company to send their flyers to people they want to reach but whose names and addresses they don't know. Although the flyer company is responsible for delivering the flyers to the designated recipients, they do not disclose the recipients' names and addresses, because names and addresses are their trade secrets. On the other hand, if the flyers are returned by the post office due to unsuccessful delivery, the flyer company will refund the delivery fee to the client proportionally.

The fee for sending flyers depends on the number of flyers and the nature of the recipients. Usually, it costs 48 pounds for every 23,600 copies. A waterproof glass raincoat manufacturer paid 48 pounds, but after only 6,000 flyers were sent out, he excitedly called the flyer company to request that they stop sending them. This is because his inventory was sold out after the first batch of flyers was sent out.

Not long ago, a soap merchant commissioned the flyer company to distribute flyers to 12 million housewives in England, at a cost of two pounds per thousand copies, totaling approximately 24,000 pounds. (Needless to say, postage and paper are the responsibility of the client, but it is also possible to pay the flyer company to handle it.)

The flyers distributed by the flyer company are not limited to commercial purposes. British political parties often use them to distribute political flyers. Once, George Bernard Shaw wanted to draw the attention of every member of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Irish Parliament to his "simplified spelling scheme," so he also entrusted the flyer company to send out his proposal.

How does the flyer company find so many names and addresses? Naturally, telephone books, directories of prominent people, address books, and the like are used. In addition, the company also sends people to read newspapers, recording every name and address that may be used sooner or later. Furthermore, they also purchase lists of participants in various gatherings, extracting useful information.

Once names and addresses are in the hands of the flyer company, they are sorted and classified, becoming their assets. I think if the household registration section of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau were to operate a side business, setting up a flyer company like the one in England would be a good deal.

### What Kind of Person is Mrs. Truman?

â Baozhu

When it comes to Mrs. Roosevelt, almost everyone knows that she was a very shrewd, capable, and great woman, and a good helper to the former President of the United States. However, Mrs. Truman is the opposite, remaining silent and unknown, even though she has been the First Lady for almost four years. Not to mention that Chinese people don't know her, even Americans themselves don't pay much attention to her. In general, apart from "an ordinary housewife," there is nothing else worth mentioning about her.

However, people who are close to her know that this American First Lady is not as ordinary as people imagine. She was originally Truman's top advisor. During the presidential campaign, President Truman always introduced his wife as "my boss."

Mrs. Truman's name is Bess, and her maiden name is Wallace. She was born in a very wealthy and famous family in Independence, Missouri. After graduating from Independence High School, she attended the famous Barstow School for Girls in Kansas City. Although Bess was a daughter of a wealthy family, she taught at the girls' school. At that time, she had not yet married Truman. This June will mark their 30th wedding anniversary.

Because she is naturallyä¸åæ¬¢äº¤éååºé£å¤´, there are fewer opportunities for people to get to know her. In fact, she is not only a good housewife, but also a woman with great insight, talent, and knowledge.

Although she has never given a speech, every one of President Truman's speeches has been carefully read, studied, and corrected by her first. When Mr. Truman first became a senator, Bess worked as his private secretary. Later, because her daughter Margaret was not in good health when she was young, she stopped working to take care of her child and manage the household. She likes to read, especially history and biographies. As the president of such a large country, Truman naturally has little time to read, but it doesn't matter, his wife often reads articles about world events and summarizes them for the president. Bess, like her husband and daughter, also loves music. In addition, she likes to play bridge, but unfortunately she doesn't have much time now.

Mrs. Truman does not photograph well, so the First Lady seen in news photos is short and fat. In fact, this sixty-four-year-old lady is not that ugly. She has a small face, well-proportioned features, blue-gray eyes, and silver-gray hair that is always neatly combed. When she first entered the White House, she often saw newspapers and magazines saying that she looked like a "housekeeper." Once, she said to her friends with a wry smile, "What's wrong with that?" Bess also likes to wear elegant clothes and high-quality fabrics; however, she is very frugal. During the day, she always wears very ordinary clothes, but she is more particular about her evening gowns.

American government officials, senators, and their wives like to attend Mrs. Truman's banquets, because Bess is very kind and amiable, making them feel like they are at home. The seating arrangements do not have to be arranged according to rank. No matter how many guests there are, the First Lady must talk to each one. "She always talks about you, and doesn't brag about herself," one guest told others upon returning. She also cooks very well. During the war, even though she was already the wife of the vice president, she did not have a maid, just like other ordinary American families. She said, "My husband likes to eat steak and fried yams. As long as I make these two dishes for him every night, he is very happy."

Unlike ordinary officials' wives who travel to scenic spots to escape the heat, Bess likes to return to her old home every summer to live with her mother, driving away the guards, digging in the mud in the garden, watering flowers, or inviting her old friends to play bridge.

Mrs. Truman is not exactly great but certainly not stupid or vulgar. She is a meritorious person to her husband, daughter, and family, and naturally, she is not without benefit to the United States.
