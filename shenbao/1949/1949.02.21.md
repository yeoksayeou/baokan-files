Gan Jiehou, Cheng Siyuan, Qiu Changwei, Huang Xuecun, Li Yuqing, and others accompanied him. Vice Minister Ye Gongchao and Deputy Chief Zhang Shouhsien also flew to Guangzhou on the same plane. News of Acting President Li's flight to Guangzhou was known to very few beforehand; only Huang Shaohong and a few others went to the airport to see him off. In addition to inspections in Guangzhou, the Acting President will also urge President Sun and the heads of various executive Yuan departments to return to Nanjing. He will also hold talks with legislators in Guangzhou and is expected to return to Nanjing in one or two days.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] Acting President Li arrived at Tianhe Airport at 12:55 PM on the 20th, having flown from Nanjing aboard the special plane "Sino-American." Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Chen Jitang, Yu Hanmou, Zhang Fakui, Xue Yue, Ouyang Ju, Zheng Yanfen, the heads of various central ministries and departments, officials from Guangdong and Guangzhou, US Consul General Newton, US Minister Clark, and over fifty others personally went to the airport to welcome him. Acting President Li was dressed in a dark velvet suit with subtle white stripes, looking energetic and smiling warmly. Upon disembarking, he first shook hands with President Sun, repeatedly saying, "I've kept you waiting for two hours." The welcomers immediately greeted him with enthusiastic drumming. When Acting President Li shook hands with Mr. Chen Jitang, he showed particular warmth. He then inspected the honor guard amidst the melodious military music and posed for a photo with President Sun, Yu Hanmou, and Mayor Ouyang, before boarding vehicle number "〇〇一八九二," accompanied by President Sun and others, to rest at Chairman Xue's official residence.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] In the afternoon of the 20th, Acting President Li received General Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Deng Guang, concurrently Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, at the headquarters. At 5:00 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by President Sun. It was decided that he would attend an expanded memorial week ceremony on the morning of the 21st, and give instructions to the heads of various ministries. Afterwards, he would visit the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs at Huanghuagang. He would attend a luncheon hosted by Chairman Xue, and it was decided that he would fly from Guangzhou to Guilin on the afternoon of the 21st, then transfer via Changsha and Wuhan for inspections before returning to Nanjing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] It is learned that Acting President Li will soon convene a meeting of military and political leaders in Nanjing, which is closely related to the current overall situation. As of the 20th, it is known that Acting President Li is personally going to Guangzhou to invite President Sun Ke and important leaders from the Executive Yuan to return to Nanjing. He has also telegraphed Zhang Qun in Chongqing, hoping he will come to Nanjing immediately to discuss important matters together. The "Zhuiyun" special plane, which took Xishan back to Jin on the 20th, flew directly to Lanzhou after arriving in Bing, reportedly to pick up Zhang Zhizhong to come to Nanjing. Unless there are other changes, Acting President Li, Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and others are all expected to arrive in Nanjing separately within two or three days, so that they can quickly confer with He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and others waiting in Nanjing. It is also learned that the important meeting to be convened by Acting President Li will not change his consistent policy of peace. However, in order to promote overall peace, the government must be united internally. The meeting will address possible disagreements and unify opinions from all sides to achieve a comprehensive solution.

### Delivers Speech at Airport, Hoping Compatriots Assist in Achieving Peace

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] Acting President Li delivered a speech at the airport, saying: "Guangdong is the birthplace of the Chinese National Revolution and has made great contributions to the revolution. I have been away from Guangdong for many years, and I am very pleased to be able to meet with the elders and old friends of Guangdong on this inspection tour. Guangdong has suffered from years of war, famine, and poverty, and the people have suffered deeply. Although the central government has provided relief, it is only a drop in the bucket and has not been able to alleviate the people's suffering. This is something I deeply regret. Unfortunately, after eight years of war against Japan, China has been followed by three years of civil war, and the suffering of the people has reached an unbearable level. Ending the war and seeking peace is the unanimous desire of the nation. Therefore, from the day I took office, I have acted with the utmost sincerity to achieve overall peace. Now that the people of the whole country unanimously advocate eliminating the scourge of war, continuing the war is against the will of the people. Therefore, I am not only willing to make the greatest efforts for peace, but also have unlimited confidence in the inevitable realization of peace. I also believe that in today's situation where compatriots across the country are trapped in dire straits, any party must accept the peace demands of the majority of the people, otherwise, popular resentment will accumulate and lead to failure. I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together for their own happiness, assist the government, and achieve the realization of peace. The urgent need for political reform in China today, and the need to eliminate corruption, are the urgent tasks of the government and necessary measures to alleviate the suffering of the people and improve administrative efficiency. I have already made a sincere statement in a broadcast address to military and government personnel across the country a few days ago. The government will resolutely work in this direction in the future, in order to live up to the earnest expectations of compatriots across the country. I will leave Guangdong in a few days and return to Nanjing after inspecting various places. I sincerely hope that compatriots in Guangdong will submit their opinions on promoting peace and reforming politics at any time. I and my colleagues in the government will certainly be happy to accept them."

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th] Wu Tiecheng, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, changed his plans to fly north due to Acting President Li's visit to Guangzhou on the 20th.

### Liu Wenhui Issues Solemn Statement, Rumors of Kang Troops Entering Sichuan are False

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Regarding the recent rumors that Xikang troops were moving to Chengdu, Liu Wenhui, Chairman of Xikang Province, recently issued a solemn statement here, as follows: "The so-called Xikang troops, namely the 24th Army of the Army, are national troops and not local troops. They have been stationed in Sichuan's Mingshan, Qiong Lai, Mujiang, Shuangliu, and the Chengdu-Ya'an Road for more than ten years. Recently, due to picking up military supplies in Chengdu, two divisions of the Shuangliu troops, originally stationed 40 miles from Chengdu, were deployed to Wuhou Temple outside the South Gate of Chengdu, which was ordinary and not worthy of anyone's attention. Unexpectedly, it has recently been cited as news material. According to yesterday's (19th) Dagong Evening News, the newly appointed Mayor of Hankou, Yan Xunfu, said at a press conference: 'Amidst the current peace talks, the chairman of a certain province in the southwest dared to send troops to attack Chengdu.' This bizarre news, if known to the 700,000 citizens of Chengdu, would surely be regarded as a baseless myth. Rumors are a special product of turbulent times. The creators have ulterior motives, and those who unintentionally promote them spread falsehoods, further introducing the rumors into the realm of mythology, which may be an achievement that the creators never dreamed of."

### Xia Wei Flies to Hankou

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 20th] Anhui Chairman and Commander of a certain Army Corps Xia Wei, flew from Anhui to Hankou on the morning of the 19th to report to the Central China authorities. Because Commander-in-Chief Bai flew to Nanjing on official business, they did not have much time to talk. It is heard that Xia visited Li Pinsian this morning and is scheduled to fly back to his post within the day.

### Zhong Tianxin Arrives in Nanjing from Shanghai, Declines to Disclose Details of Talks in Hong Kong, But Says Confidence in Peace Talks Prospects has Increased

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Zhong Tianxin, Minister of Water Resources and government peace talk representative, who flew to Shanghai from Guangzhou on the 19th, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 20th aboard the Ziqiang plane. Zuo Gong, Deputy Secretary-General of the government delegation, came to Nanjing on the same plane. Zhong was ordered by President Sun to report to Acting President Li on the talks with CCP personnel in Hong Kong. Because Acting President Li had already left Nanjing for Guangzhou on the morning of the 20th, Zhong will wait in Nanjing to meet him. The date of his return to Guangzhou is undetermined.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After arriving in Nanjing from Shanghai, Zhong Tianxin immediately visited Ju Zheng and Yu Youren, and is scheduled to meet with Tong Guanxian, Bai Chongxi, and others on the 21st. According to Zhong's statement to reporters on the evening of the 20th, his visit to Nanjing from Guangzhou was partly to report to Acting President Li on the negotiations with CCP representatives in South China during this trip to Hong Kong. It was also on behalf of President Sun to ask Acting President Li for instructions on the partial reorganization of several ministries of the Executive Yuan (such as the Ministries of Social Affairs, Communications, Agriculture, and Forestry) due to the resignations of the heads. Upon arrival in Shanghai, he learned that Acting President Li had decided to fly to Guangzhou. Now that Acting President Li is already in Guangzhou, President Sun can discuss everything with the Acting President in person. When asked about the gains and observations of his trip to Hong Kong, Zhong said: "Since returning from Hong Kong, I have gained some confidence in the prospects for peace talks. However, due to restrictions, I cannot disclose the content of the talks. What I can say is that the CCP representatives in South China explained the eight conditions, and I, in my personal capacity, explained the government's view on the eight articles. I raised some opinions and asked the CCP representatives in South China to relay them, which they agreed to do." Zhong also solemnly declared: "The rumors that President Sun advocates war are purely misunderstandings. When the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou, President Sun telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments, expressing his intention to continue promoting overall peace."

### Hong Kong Communist Party Official Denies Contact with Zhong

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 19th] Sources close to the "United Front" emphasize that the Communist Party and its allies aim to shorten the civil war through peace talks, but will never abandon Mao Zedong's goal of eight conditions proposed on January 14, and demand the dissolution of the Kuomintang government and its various organizations. The Communist Party will, in any case, advance south of the Yangtze River, eliminate the remnants of feudal rule, and establish a democratic government throughout China. It also stated that the Beijing-Shanghai peace delegation that recently arrived in Peiping is only regarded by the Communist authorities as representatives of the two places, expressing the opinions of the local people, and not as negotiators representing the Kuomintang government. Furthermore, a Hong Kong Communist Party official strictly denies the rumors circulating in Hong Kong and Guangzhou that Zhong Tianxin, representative of Sun Ke, recently went to Hong Kong to contact Communist Party representatives in an attempt to start peace talks.

### Wu Yuhou and Others to Go to Hong Kong Today to Meet with CCP Officials

### Gan Provincial Assembly Appeals for Unity

### Twice Declining Peace Talks Representative, Zhang Zhizhong Explains Reasons, One Person Cannot Carry Two Burdens

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 20th] At a gathering of cultural figures on the 20th, General Zhang Zhizhong explained why he had recently twice declined Acting President Li's invitation to be a peace talks representative. One person cannot carry two burdens. The so-called two burdens are: one is that both Nanjing and Guangzhou have telegraphed him to go and discuss national affairs, and the other is that he is dedicated to the stability and progress of the Northwest and cannot take care of both. He sought the opinions of the attendees, who hoped that Zhang should still strive for overall peace when peace is indeed possible, in order to achieve complete success.

Reform Northwest, Unite Hui and Han

Zhang continued to explain the political reform of the Northwest. Regarding the collapsing economic situation, he had already agreed on comprehensive remedial measures. The main purpose of the emergency economic plan is to seek self-reliance, but in the course of implementation, due to the barren land and poor people in the Northwest, the conditions are insufficient, and the central government still needs to assist. Personnel will be sent to Nanjing in the coming days to discuss the matter. As for land reform, property tax collection, and land value-added tax, it is not that there is no way, but the reason for the delay in implementation is that local bullies and gentry are obstructing it. All democratic political measures need to be passed by local public opinion institutions, but today's people's representatives are not completely representative of public opinion, which is something we should reflect on. He warned: "The tide of the democratic era is approaching, and everything that violates the trend of the era will be eliminated." Zhang pointed out the unique Hui-Han problem in the Northwest, which is a vicious political conspiracy of the Qing government. We should not be deceived by the mistakes of history. Based on the correct instructions of the Three Principles of the People's nationalism policy, ethnic groups should love each other like brothers and sisters and should no longer have prejudices and suspicions. Therefore, we should fundamentally eliminate the erroneous and sinful Hui-Han differences in thought and unite the Northwest, stabilize peace, and create freedom and happiness to lay a permanent and unshakable foundation.

Ma Hongkui Advocates Quick Action

General Ma Hongkui then gave a speech. He advocated that social reform should be carried out with the means of quickly cutting through tangled hemp, without any scruples. Regarding the Han-Hui issue, he, in his capacity as township chief, hoped that the attending religious figures would pay more attention to and explain it, and must not repeat the mistakes of history.

### Hubei Provincial Assembly Standing Committee Cables, Requesting Confiscation of Tycoon Capital

### Using Central Bank's Stock of Gold and Silver to Curb Inflation, New Economic Plan Approved by Acting President Li

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 20th] It was revealed here on the 20th that Acting President Li has approved the new economic measures drafted by Finance Minister Xu Kan. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance denied that gold yuan coins would be minted, but admitted that the new economic measures include: (1) Free trading of gold, silver, and foreign currency, (2) Reducing the amount of gold yuan notes issued, (3) Free circulation of silver coins, (4) The Central Bank's stock of metals will be used entirely to curb inflation, (5) Issuing short-term US dollar bonds.

[Local News] Liu Gongyun, Governor of the Central Bank, recently went to Nanjing from Shanghai with Finance Minister Xu Kan and Budget Director Pang Songzhou to meet with Acting President Li, presented and requested instructions on economic reform measures.

### ECA Announces Lifting of Ban, US Cotton to Resume Shipping to China, Lapham to go to Washington in the Next Day or Two

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] An ECA spokesman said: "The ECA has lifted the ban on shipping cotton to China." Shippers were notified on the 19th to resume shipping, and actual shipping will begin within the next week, shipping from US seaports to Shanghai.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The US$15 million of American cotton, which had been halted for over a week due to the Chinese Civil War, was ordered to resume shipping today by ECA Director Hoffman and is scheduled to be delivered in Shanghai in February and March. According to Cleveland, the Director of the China Affairs Office, the ECA is satisfied with the supply situation in Shanghai and can allow the resumption of transport. This US cotton totals about 10,000 bales. In the past, due to the unstable situation in China, the ECA did not want to have a large amount of inventory piled up, so it ordered the suspension of transport. 10,000 bales were already en route when the ban was imposed and were planned to be diverted to Japan. The ECA has assured shipping companies that it will not allow them to suffer losses under any circumstances, or the ECA will buy them back and transport them to Europe and other places. Several weeks ago, the ECA also stopped shipping wheat flour to North China because a barge at Dagukou was confiscated by the National Army during the battle.

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 19th] According to ECA China Division Director Lapham: "The Congressional Committee will begin discussing the ECA's future aid plan for China in Washington around March 1." Lapham arrived here yesterday from Shanghai and will stay at home for a few days. He plans to go to Washington on the 22nd or 23rd to report to Hoffman and attend the Congressional Committee to explain. Lapham is unwilling to express any opinion on the continued US aid to China before reporting to Hoffman. Local newspapers today published news of the Chinese Communist Party seizing the ECA's relief flour in Peiping. Howard's San Francisco News, in its editorial, supports the 51 Republican members of Congress who wrote to President Truman a few days ago, citing the rise of the Chinese Communist Party, and suggested that a senior officer organize a military, economic, and political committee to re-examine US policy toward China. The editorial said that the letter "is suggestive and without partisan bias." President Truman should act on this friendly suggestion and bring public attention to the situation in the Far East.

[United Press, New York, 19th] Former US State Department Far East Director Hobbick said in a speech at the Foreign Policy Association today: "Whether the United States can help China or not is a major question at present. Although it is late, the Nanjing government is still fighting. This is the only independent and autonomous government in all of Asia resisting the Communist advance. If the United States firmly decides to abandon China and let it run its course, it will immediately lose what it has gained in China and the Far East in the past 100 years. Europe itself will also be difficult to fully recover if it cannot obtain East Asian resources and trade with it. The more the Communist Party gains in Asia, the greater the danger of a hot war between democratic countries and the Kremlin. What we have gained in Europe will also be quickly lost and become Soviet assets. China should have the opportunity to develop into a democratic country and continue to serve as a free fortress in the Far East, which is extremely important to both China and the United States. At least there is still a chance to delay the resistance, and the United States should provide as much moral and material assistance as possible to this resistance." Columbia University professor and Far East expert Pei Fu's speech advocated the opposite.

### Legislative Yuan Resumption Imminent, Urging Committee Members from Various Places to Come to Nanjing Quickly to Attend, May Travel by Plane or Train Free of Charge with Notification and Badges

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] With the resumption of the Legislative Yuan imminent in Nanjing, the Secretariat has been actively preparing for the resumption in recent days. Although the 20th was a Sunday, the Secretariat still worked as usual and officially issued a notice on the 20th, which was forwarded by the provincial and municipal governments to inform legislators in various places and urge them to come to Nanjing quickly to register before the meeting. Regarding the means of transportation for legislators to come to Nanjing, the Legislative Yuan has reached agreements with China and Central Aviation Companies and various railway bureaus. Legislators can travel free of charge by plane or train with a meeting notice and badge. The ticket fee will be paid by the Legislative Yuan Secretariat in Nanjing. In places without planes or trains, the provincial and municipal governments are requested to facilitate transportation on the spot. In addition, the staff of the deliberation, document, and accounting groups of the Legislative Yuan Secretariat who have arrived in Guangzhou will also transfer some of them back to Nanjing to work.

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 20th] Regarding the location of the resumption of the Legislative Yuan, the legislators staying in Hunan recently decided to hold it in Guangzhou and have appointed Li Zongli to go to Guangzhou first to make contact. According to Mo Xuanyuan, the reasons why the Hunan legislators advocate for Guangzhou are: (1) Nanjing is close to the front line, which affects the mood of the legislators. (2) It is convenient to travel to Guangzhou. The date when Mo and others will depart depends on when the Legislative Yuan determines the resumption date. CCP Broadcasts Peiping Takeover Situation

### Fu Zuoyi's Troops Reorganized

CCP Broadcasts Peiping Takeover Situation

A total of 543 units have been taken over by the Communist Army Materials Takeover Committee, including state-owned enterprises, telecommunications, transportation, post offices, railways, warehouses, and military supplies originally owned by the government. The 25 units of national universities, museums, libraries, etc., are temporarily taken over by the Cultural Takeover Committee.

Editorial

### Looking at Japan's Coalition Cabinet

The Yoshida Cabinet, the seventh cabinet in Japan after the war, was announced on the 16th of this month. As we expected, it is an extremely conservative and right-leaning dictatorial cabinet in postwar Japan. Whether in terms of personnel or policy, there is nothing new to see. In terms of personnel, the Democratic Liberal Party occupies sixteen of the eighteen seats in the cabinet, including the prime minister and ministers, making it practically a one-party government. Prime Minister Yoshida also serves as Foreign Minister, his old friend Oasa Tadao remains as Minister of Health and Welfare, and the others are third-rate figures in the political world, not worth paying attention to. In terms of policy, according to Yoshida's first statement upon forming the cabinet, it is to guarantee fighting against the Communist Party and to concentrate the national strength of Japan to accelerate economic recovery. Yoshida also promised to implement the nine principles of the US authorities' guidance for Japan's recovery, and to implement strict administrative reforms to maintain financial stability and reduce all unnecessary expenditures. As for the detailed policy program of the cabinet, it has not yet been formulated, and it will probably still follow the direction of the previous cabinet, and it is impossible to have novel and progressive performance. Japan's postwar politics have always been stagnant in the old form, which can be explained by this.

Can the Yoshida cabinet succeed in domestic affairs or economic policy? What impact will it have on the domestic and Far Eastern situation in Japan? There is a need for analysis and explanation. First, let's talk about anti-communism. The strength of the Communist Party in Japan is originally very weak. In the previous House of Representatives, out of 466 seats, only four were Communist Party members. The result of this general election was that 35 were elected, about nine times as many. If we calculate based on the total number of votes, out of 32 million votes nationwide, the party received more than 3.5 million votes. In other words, on average, one out of every nine Japanese voters voted for the Communist Party. The expansion of the Japanese Communist Party's power cannot be taken lightly. On the one hand, the military development of the Chinese Communist Party stimulated the Japanese people and contributed to the victory of the Japanese Communist Party and the general election. On the other hand, due to the failures of the past few cabinets in implementing policies, everything showed corruption and incompetence, creating opportunities for the development of the Japanese Communist Party. The Yoshida cabinet, with anti-communism as its duty, and with its strength and the convenience of MacArthur's support, can suppress the development of the Communist Party, which is undoubtedly certain. However, Yoshida is anti-communist with right-leaning policies and a conservative posture, without any signs of democratic progress. Whether he can stop this red tide is worth serious attention.

Next, let's talk about economic recovery, which is an important issue for the revival of Japanese militarism today. The nine principles implemented by MacArthur last year to guide Japan are mainly aimed at guiding the recovery of old Japan. The so-called enterprise management and industrial rationalization, in fact, make the Japanese capitalist class expand its exploitation power. On the other hand, it poses the danger of an increasing number of unemployed in the Japanese working class. Such a dangerous economic policy not only revives old Japan, completely violating the principles of the Potsdam Declaration, but also has a rewarding effect on the development of the Japanese Communist Party, and even stimulates the revival of the old Japanese aggressive mania. Japanese economists unanimously agree that this economic recovery is not beneficial to the future of Japan's economic democratization, it only leads Japan to another new war, as a vanguard for the United States. Yoshida Shigeru said, "The victory in this general election is evidence that the Japanese people want the current democratic politics, sound conservatism, and the people want political security." If the majority of Japanese people think as Yoshida said, then the Japanese people psychologically need a revival of old Japan, and will not hesitate to engage in another war of aggression to revive old Japan, which will be fully demonstrated by this.

Based on the facts analyzed above, it shows that the emergence of the Yoshida cabinet is another success for the right-leaning conservative forces in Japan. The result of its confrontation and struggle with the Communist Party will inevitably make the polarization of Japan's political undercurrent not only unavoidable, but also increasingly acute. On the day of Yoshida's successful cabinet formation, the Japanese Communist Party declared that it would cause the Yoshida cabinet to die prematurely. It will probably use labor offensives and the shortcomings of the nine economic principles to try to disintegrate the Yoshida cabinet in many ways, or make Yoshida's policies fail, and then force the Japanese people to turn to the left. In short, the political tide in Japan will become more dangerous day by day, with confrontation between left and right parties, and division within the right-wing parties. Where the "Yoshida Maru" will run aground will have a decisive impact on Japan's polarized politics, which is worth paying close attention to.

### Using Foreign News Agencies: Conspirators Spreading Rumors; A Certain Person in Charge Issues a Statement Denouncing Them

[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday's newspaper reported that United Press reporter Zhang Guoxing's Nanjing dispatch on the 19th stated: "President Chiang, who has temporarily retired, is still issuing orders and still retains enough presidential power to exercise a veto in future peace talks with the Communists. At the same time, he is exercising these powers daily to open the door for his reinstatement." It also stated that "President Chiang frequently issues various instructions to the Minister of National Defense and the President of the Central Bank." The reporter even stated: "Chiang's exercise of presidential power during his retirement seems to be an obstacle to Li Zongren's peace negotiations with the Communists and the implementation of radical political reforms." "Reactionaries, under Chiang's protection, are exerting their influence and power throughout the country to hinder or sabotage Li Zongren's peace efforts and prepare for Chiang's reinstatement," and so on. A Central News Agency reporter recently inquired about the opinions of a certain person in charge here regarding this telegram from Zhang Guoxing. According to him, "This is obviously a conspiracy by conspirators to use foreign news agencies and abuse the freedom of the press in government areas to deliberately spread vicious rumors, attempting to slander President Chiang's sincerity, purity, and greatness for the country, destroy his credibility, sow discord between President Chiang and Acting President Li, create a dangerous political turmoil, and deepen China's crisis. Fortunately, the methods of these conspirators are clumsy and naive, and anyone with discernment will know their intentions at a glance and will never be deceived by them."

### The Shandong Communist Authorities Issue Customs Regulations; Ships Departing from Hong Kong Mostly Sail to Ports in Northern Shandong

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 19th] The Shandong Communist authorities have issued customs regulations stipulating the method of levying taxes on imported goods. Hong Kong has recently received many copies of these regulations, and Chinese business people are secretly circulating them. According to well-informed sources, imported goods are divided into three categories: (1) those that are completely tax-exempt upon import, such as steel, iron, trucks, and medicines; (2) those that are not essential goods, which are taxed according to their nature; and (3) goods that are prohibited from import, including many types of "luxury goods," such as perfume, stockings, and nylon stockings. According to Chinese authorities, similar customs regulations will also be issued in the Tianjin area. Trade between Hong Kong and the Communist areas previously took place via North Korea, but in the past few weeks, it has been directly trading with Shandong. Many of the ships that originally sailed to North Korea have recently changed their course to Yantai or other ports in northern Shandong. Many ships in Hong Kong will also sail to Shandong, but the destination stated on the official permits is still North Korea, because the Hong Kong authorities refuse to issue permits to sail to Communist ports. The promulgation of the Shandong customs law has deeply interested Chinese and foreign business people here. Merchants here are impatient to restore trade relations with North China. Even the most traditional British companies are trying to contact the Communists to engage in trade. Hong Kong's trade volume increased continuously in 1948, but now there are signs of decline. Imports have fallen from HK$158 million in December of last year to HK$159 million in January. Hong Kong's warehouses are full of goods. Due to the disintegration of China under the Nationalist government and the blockade of Communist-occupied areas, its outlets are becoming increasingly narrow. Therefore, restoring trade with North China can give the Hong Kong business community a new lease of life. There are varying opinions on the future of this trade. Most Chinese and foreign merchants believe that large-scale trade with North China can be restored soon. If so, the United States will be at a disadvantage, while Hong Kong and the United Kingdom will gain an advantage. However, some foreign merchants believe that Mao Zedong's recently declared trade system should be the basis for trade between the "liberated" areas and other areas, so it is not easy to develop large-scale trade relations. According to the current method for North Korea and Shandong, the goods are purchased and paid for by Chinese people in Hong Kong, and transported by specially chartered ships. At the same time, most business people here point out that the Communist Party has expressed many times that it is very interested in restoring normal trade relations with foreign countries, especially in the supply of machinery and important industrial products, because North China is in great need of these items. Many representatives of Chinese commercial companies stationed in Communist areas have recently returned to Hong Kong to purchase goods. They hope that this is a sign of the restoration of normal trade between the Communist areas and the outside world.

### Xu Xueyu Discusses North-South Navigation: The Main Point is to Protect Navigation Rights; The Current Exchange of Flour for Coal is a "Cautious" Move

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Xu Xueyu, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, said on the issue of North-South navigation: "One of the important meanings of navigation lies in protecting China's inland river navigation rights. He believes that if the British company Taikoo's Hunan ship succeeds in transporting Kailuan coal to Hong Kong, then not only will Shanghai's required coal need to be purchased from foreign countries using foreign exchange, but it will also create a precedent for foreign ships to navigate China's inland rivers." He also pointed out that Hong Kong's coal consumption in the past relied on Africa, and the transportation cost was higher than Kailuan coal, indicating that the British's rapid dispatch of ships to the north also had a trade motive. Xu Xueyu believes that the current initial North-South navigation, limited to the exchange of flour for coal, is a "cautious" measure. When asked by reporters when the types of materials could be increased and passenger transportation could be added, he said: "It may be difficult to do so for the time being, and further efforts are needed." Xu came to Taiwan a few days ago and returned to Shanghai on the 20th. As a result of his talks with Chen Cheng, chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government, both parties agreed that the Bank of Taiwan would lend the Taiwan branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company NT$1 billion per month, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would purchase flour of the corresponding amount from Shanghai each month and transport it to Taiwan for repayment.

### European Recovery Program: America's Biggest Bargain

[United States Information Service Washington 15th Dispatch] The Christian Science Monitor published an editorial on February 12th entitled "America's Biggest Bargain," stating:

As Congress begins discussing the second year of the Marshall Plan, a group of reliable American observers are revisiting Europe and reporting on the changes they have seen since a year ago. Americans can also see these changes in the figures submitted to Congress by ECA Administrator Hoffman. Or they can see it in the more casual material supplied by free journalists.

They can compare the $4.28 billion requested by the ECA for the 1949-1950 fiscal year with the $5.055 billion for the previous fiscal year. Or they can imagine the scene in London from the newly painted steps and polished brass railings of various military stations and buildings.

They can take encouragement from the fact that ECA officials believe that Europe can continue to make real progress next year and that US aid can be reduced. Or they can note what US aid has meant in Britain, France, and Italy.

As ECA Administrator Hoffman said after studying the effects of the first year of US aid: "If this plan brings us peace and stability - as I believe it will - then it will be the biggest bargain the American people have ever made."

As journalist Alsop wrote from London: "If good news were generally recognized as having headline value, then what has happened in London would have been the headline of American newspapers long ago. In the past year, the British people have accomplished a miracle."

Another reporter said: "US aid has actually brought Italy back to its feet." There is no doubt in Congress about the success of this plan. America not only needs to supply Europe with machinery and raw materials to improve their lives but also needs to supply weapons to protect this improvement. Therefore, the future problem is more complicated. The existence of this need is certainly due to the success of the economic plan. But this certainly means that American and European efforts should be divided into production measures and non-productive defense measures.

It is gratifying that the trend of aid to Europe has brought about a fundamental change in the European picture. Initially, most of the materials under the Marshall Plan were food and agricultural products, intended for immediate consumption, and agricultural products necessary to increase grain production. But by the autumn of last year, at least half of the materials were industrial materials, and Europe acquired new industrial equipment for production. Good harvests and increased factory output supported this plan.

After the end of the Marshall Plan period in 1952, the expected large-scale deficit of European dollars will somewhat diminish these advances. Similarly, Americans cannot help but feel disappointed that European governments have failed to cooperate more extensively with each other.

But these factors cannot become strong counter-evidence that would prevent us from carrying out this plan with all our strength. In its first year of achievement, this plan has brought us great gains. Trade within Europe will reduce Europe's dependence on the dollar, and the progress they have already made under cooperation will encourage them to cooperate further with each other.

### US Under Secretary of the Army Draper's Resignation Approved, Extreme Shock in Tokyo, Japanese Suspect Changes to the US Recovery Plan for Japan, MacArthur Believes the US Has an Obligation to Protect Japan

[United Press Tokyo 20th Dispatch] The resignation of US Under Secretary of the Army Draper has caused great unease among the Japanese, who believe that Draper is the strongest advocate of the "rebuilding Japan" policy. This resignation follows closely on the heels of reports that Secretary of the Army Royal advocated a re-examination of the US military position in the Far East (later denied), so the Japanese are extremely pessimistic about Draper's departure. They cannot say for sure what advantages or disadvantages this has for Japan, but they are certain that it is absolutely unfavorable to Japan. Although Draper's resignation had been submitted to President Truman long ago, the acceptance of his resignation just as the debate over what Royal revealed at the Tokyo press conference was underway made the Japanese believe that there must be a reason behind it. Their unease stems in part from a lack of confidence in the US's overall economic recovery of Japan. Regardless of the US's military policy toward Japan, Royal and any other senior US officials have never hinted that economic aid to Japan would be stopped - if the Japanese expressed their determination to help themselves. Observers here believe that Royal and Draper have at least seen the economic needs of Japan. But Draper's resignation is particularly shocking to the Japanese. Draper's work is directly related to the occupied territories, so his departure raises the question of who will succeed him, and the Japanese are now eagerly awaiting the answer to this question.

[Associated Press Washington 19th Dispatch] The White House announced today that Under Secretary of the Army Draper will resign on the 28th of this month, and the resignation has been approved by President Truman. Draper, a Republican from the financial world, has served as Under Secretary since October 1947. He has made many plans for the occupation policies of both Japan and Germany, and his report on Japan in particular has been criticized.

[United Press Tokyo 20th Dispatch] According to all indications here, General MacArthur believes that the United States now has an economic obligation to the people of Japan and at least a temporary obligation to protect Japan from aggression. MacArthur is unwilling to get involved in the "Royal Affair," but his past statements clearly show his views on the issue of US responsibility for Japan. Since MacArthur is responsible for supervising here, it is naturally believed that his opinions have an important place in the US's formulation of its policy toward Japan. MacArthur has repeatedly referred to Japan as the Allied war criminal, actually the war criminal of the US occupation forces, and has said that the United States has an obligation to take care of these criminals economically. He has said at least once that the occupation forces are responsible for ensuring Japan's security until a peace treaty is signed. He even raised the question of who would protect Japan after the signing of the peace treaty. In answering his own question, MacArthur once suggested that Japan should be guaranteed by the United Nations. In addition, he also implied that the US Air Force stationed on Okinawa could assume this responsibility.

[United Press Tokyo 20th Dispatch] Occupation officials expressed their views on the 20th that US policy toward Japan will not change after Under Secretary of the Army Draper's resignation. Major General LaGart, Director of the Economic and Scientific Section of the Allied Headquarters, said that there are no signs of any changes affecting Japan.

### Disagreements in US Policy Toward Japan: Conflicting Opinions on Industrial Level and Reparations, the Work of the Far Eastern Commission is Hesitant and Unsure

[United Press Washington 20th Dispatch] According to the results of the investigation by this agency on the issue of the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet representatives' frequent attacks are not as destructive to the function of the Far Eastern Commission as is generally imagined. People on the Far Eastern Commission who were consulted by this agency said that one of the fundamental reasons why the Far Eastern Commission cannot proceed more quickly with its work is that the US has not yet decided on a policy of what kind of industrial level should be allowed for Japan. They said that before this decision is made, the issue of reparations cannot be resolved, so the Far Eastern Commission cannot understand what its final plan should be like.

Soviet representative Pan Youxin's demands and public statements have led people unfamiliar with the Far Eastern Commission to believe that the Soviet strategy may be to obstruct the work of the commission. But according to the representatives consulted by this agency, the real problem is "when can the United States decide." According to people familiar with the US's difficulties, these difficulties are due to two conflicting opinions on the two issues of industry and reparations. One faction believes that all of Japan's existing industry should be left to Japan so that Japan can be economically strong and self-sufficient, while the other faction believes that Japan's industry should be dismantled to the lowest level so that the victims of Japanese aggression can receive just compensation. The representatives of the Far Eastern Commission are particularly troubled by Pan Youxin's disregard for the confidentiality of the commission's meetings and his frequent public statements. The representatives also strongly disagree with the content of Pan's statements. They feel that Pan Youxin is using the Far Eastern Commission as a propaganda ground. According to the representatives interviewed by this agency, the Soviet delegation is "very cooperative" in conducting the ordinary affairs of the commission. According to a study of recently published reports, the Far Eastern Commission announces at least one policy resolution each month that the Soviet Union also endorses, which the Soviet Union could have vetoed.

### Agnes Smedley Complains About the US Military Authorities

Her Reputation Has Been Cleared, But It Cannot Compensate

[United Press New York 19th Dispatch] Writer Agnes Smedley thanked the Army Department on the 19th for "clearing her name" but said that she has suffered irreparable losses from being accused of being a Soviet spy. Her defense lawyer issued a statement on her behalf stating: "I express my gratitude to the Army Department for clearing my name from being accused of being a Soviet spy. But at the same time, I must state that the withdrawal of lies that have already gone too far, in addition to financial losses, I have suffered irreparable pain. I hope that this policy of humiliation before investigation can be ended, and that a way can be found to prevent officials from defaming loyal citizens, while they hide behind laws that cannot be sued."

[United Press Tokyo 19th Dispatch] MacArthur's official spokesperson told the United Press that MacArthur Headquarters will have "no immediate" response to the Army Department's admission in Washington that the publication of the pre-war communist spy case between China and Japan was "inappropriate." Colonel Ecker, MacArthur's new information bureau chief, did not indicate when there would be a response. He told foreign reporters at a press conference on February 11 that he was "fully responsible" for the Army Department's Sorge spy case report.

### Norwegian Labor Party Approves Government's Foreign Policy by an Overwhelming Majority, Maintaining Security Should Be Done in Cooperation With Western Countries

[Associated Press Norwegian Capital 19th Dispatch] The Norwegian Labor Party held a closed-door meeting all day today, where Foreign Minister Lange reported on the negotiations with Britain and the United States on the North Atlantic Treaty. That night, a motion was passed by 329 votes to 35, approving the Labor Party government's foreign policy.

Norway has formally accepted the invitation from Western countries to participate in the North Atlantic Defense Treaty. There is now only one hurdle left, which is for the parliament to pass the foreign policy drafted by Lange. This matter can be voted on within the next week. At that time, all 150 members of parliament, except for the 11 communist seats, can vote in favor. The Soviet Union has warned Norway twice in three weeks not to join the North Atlantic Alliance. Norway has not yet responded to the second note. In its response to the first note, it expressed its willingness to study the possibility of a regional alliance. Recent developments show that Norway will also reject this suggestion.

[Agence France-Presse Oslo 20th Dispatch] The Norwegian Labor Party National Council passed the following resolution: "The National Council believes that Norway's security on defense issues should be resolved through cooperation with Western democratic countries. This cooperation should be based on the United Nations Charter and should be purely defensive and peaceful in both practice and form."

### Revolutionary Conspiracy Cracked in Bolivia, President Orders National Martial Law, Leaders of the Revolutionary Movement Arrested

The Bolivian government has also formally protested to Peru, accusing it of allowing Bolivian political exiles to operate within its borders.

### Strikes Break Out One After Another, Political Situation in Italy is Unstable

[Agence France-Presse Rome 19th Dispatch] The political situation in Italy has fluctuated greatly in the past 48 hours, one reason being the strike in Isola del Liri, and another being the release of war criminal Prince Borghese, which has aroused protests from many sectors of the Italian people. The left-wing parties have criticized the police's improper handling of the strike. Subsequently, Rome staged a general strike for several hours, and several towns in the north also experienced work stoppages and demonstrations. The opposition parties are now using the new situation to try to overthrow the coalition government led by Catholic Party leader Gasperi.

### Egyptian Prime Minister Appeals to the United States to Expand Economic Aid to the Middle East, It Is Intolerable That British Troops Remain in Egypt

[United Press Cairo 20th Dispatch] In a written statement submitted exclusively to the United Press on the 20th, Egyptian Prime Minister Hadi appealed to the United States to expand the Marshall Plan to the Middle East to help deter communism before it is too late. This is the first statement made by Hadi to a foreign journalist since succeeding Nokrashy as Prime Minister.

Hadi said that although Egypt made many contributions to the Allies during the war, it did not receive aid under the Marshall Plan. He said, "Egypt hopes to receive the same political support and material assistance from Britain as Britain gives to Turkey, Greece, and Western Europe." I should point out that the communist crisis in the Middle East is no less serious than in other parts of Europe and Asia, and that there is always an opportunity to prevent the Middle East from the crisis of communism by providing similar economic assistance to the Middle East as to Western Europe before it is too late." Hadi said that relations between Egypt and the United States are good, but that the United States only shows its political interest in the Middle East by supporting Jews against Arabs. He said that Arabs are "the legitimate and peaceful masters of their countries." Hadi said that Anglo-Egyptian relations are "somewhat cold and stagnant" because of "the conditions that Britain is trying to impose on Egypt in the new treaty of mutual cooperation between the two countries." He said that the current British troops remaining in Egypt is intolerable, although Britain announced its intention to withdraw all troops in 1946, it has not yet been realized.

### New Technical Assistance Plan Can Be Implemented in Three Steps, Full Completion Requires a Century

[Associated Press Washington 19th Dispatch] President Truman's new plan to develop economically backward countries is huge and complex. Most experts in the US and the United Nations believe that the President can only start the process, and the completion of the entire plan will take at least 30 years, or even more than 100 years. The plan is not just about opening factories or promoting new farming methods, but about advancing the entire economy and culture of each country by a century or more. The scope of the plan includes a large part of Latin America, Asia, the Far East, Africa, and the Middle East, with a total population of 1.65 billion people. The initial years will not cost much. The first step will be to recruit and train a large number of scientists, technicians, and experts as managers. The second step is to help countries formulate long-term development plans. The third step is to start investing, which is very large in scope, and there is no specific plan yet. The most urgent need for backward countries is food, but the highly agricultural production technology of the US and Western Europe cannot be realized in these areas for a while, so the best way is to promote industrial innovation and agricultural improvement at the same time. Areas that are not suitable for steelmaking cannot build steel plants, but rather build some light industrial factories, such as cloth factories, shoe factories, furniture factories, and daily necessities manufacturing plants. The establishment of such factories can improve living standards and allow farmers to work during most of their spare time during the year. This kind of "hidden unemployment" in rice-producing areas of Asia is the main reason for low living standards.

### Hundreds of Communists Arrested in India and Hyderabad, Indian Sikh Party Leader Also Arrested

[Associated Press Bombay 19th Dispatch] Indian police today launched a massive roundup of communists across the country to prevent a strike by one million railway workers.

In addition, hundreds of people have been arrested in Hyderabad, and the state's military government has banned gatherings of more than five people, carrying weapons, displaying communist flags, or marching in processions. In New Delhi, the government announced that it had arrested Sikh Socialist Party leader Tarasing, but this has nothing to do with the prosecution of communists. Tarasing and two companions went to New Delhi to attend a religious conference. The government considered it a political gathering and arrested them at the railway station.

### Britain Equips Siamese Army to Prevent Communists From Infiltrating

### Bevin Calls for European Unity to Work Together to Ensure Long-Term Peace, Hopes for Early Establishment of European Parliament

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in a speech in Bristol tonight, "If Western nations and other peace-loving countries can unite now, achieve complete understanding, and harmonize their defense efforts, there will be no war for centuries." Bevin made the speech at the 15th anniversary of the "Transport and General Workers' Union," of which he had been the secretary-general for many years. Bevin continued, "If we can achieve this cooperation, instead of attending meetings and listening to the abuse we have had to listen to in the past, we can sit down and govern." Referring to the recent information received by the British Foreign Office regarding concentration camps in Eastern Europe, Bevin said that these concentration camps were as bad as Hitler's concentration camps, and it was heartbreaking that people who went in were never seen again. The British people only want any country to have the political system it desires, but we cannot be forced to do so. Any measure that hinders the freedom of human thought is a disaster for the advancement of mankind. Referring to the Atlantic Charter, Bevin said, "Our purpose is not war, we do not want to attack anyone, but we also do not want to be attacked, this is our policy. We will never become aggressors, and the United States has never been willing to take on such a heavy responsibility. I hope that the countries participating in the Charter can unite and contribute to the well-being of others." Bevin hopes that the European Parliament can be established in the coming months, "The era of the balance of power is over, and unity between countries must replace it."

### Bidault's Speech

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] Former Foreign Minister Bidault stated during the National Committee debate on foreign policy of the French Popular Republican Party today, "Since we cannot build Europe based on geographical boundaries, we will build Europe based on the boundaries of freedom."

The current problem is that France should build Europe together with countries that are determined to cooperate with us according to their free will."

Detailed calculation methods have been published on page two of yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the Shanghai Postal Administration and Telecommunications Bureau received an urgent telegram from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday afternoon, deciding to implement it from today. Postal rates will increase fourfold, including the original fivefold. Telegram and long-distance telephone fees will increase fivefold, including the original sixfold. However, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau had not received a formal order by late evening. Moreover, the bureau had newly adjusted passenger and freight rates on the 12th of this month, and the calculation of freight rates is also more complicated, so new freight rates will not be implemented today. The new postal and telecommunications rates are recorded as follows: (1) Postal rates: Ordinary letter 15 yuan, postcard (single) 7.5 yuan, express mail 45 yuan, postcard (double) 15 yuan, single registered mail 65 yuan, double registered mail 245 yuan, airmail (ordinary) 60 yuan, airmail (express) 135 yuan, airmail (registered) 110 yuan.

### 402 Yangtze River Navigation Markers Replaced, Lightships Lack Equipment, Lighted Buoys Rescued

In order to ensure navigation safety, China's shipping industry is actively strengthening its equipment. In addition to strictly inspecting the quality of ships and limiting overloading, it is hoped that the competent authorities will provide more assistance in the installation of lighthouses and navigation marks, so that we can work together to quickly achieve success. We have specifically inquired about the actual situation of navigation markers in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from the person in charge of the Maritime Affairs Section of the Customs General Administration, and recorded it as follows: It is reported that the navigation markers were ordered to be reinstalled after the war. By the end of the previous year, as many as 402 had been replaced, and 113 lighted piles had been restored. Electric lights are being gradually converted to replace the original kerosene lamps. Before the war, there were 51 lightships, but only 18 can be re-established now. This number is far from sufficient due to financial difficulties, which makes it impossible to add more. However, in order to do our best to remedy the shortage of lightships, 32 lighted buoys have been installed. However, these buoys are easily damaged by collision with wood rafts and other ships, so it is difficult to be satisfactory, and there are not many suitable transport ships for the buoys. It is found that there were originally eight Yangtze River lighthouse transport ships with special structures. Now only three remain. The first ship is 20 years old, the second is 22 years old, and the third is 28 years old. After the victory, four more ships were added to undertake transportation and inspection tasks. Among them, two were warships formerly used by the U.S. Navy, and the other two were small steamers. The former are not suitable for practical use when the Yangtze River is shallow due to their excessive draft, and the latter are too small and only suitable for light tasks. In addition to the problems of incomplete equipment and insufficient funds, the most serious shortcoming is the lack of adequately trained personnel to engage in the management of river affairs and the planning of improvements. Before the war, the average number of specialists on shore and on ships was 15. They were able to effectively control this 1,500-mile-long waterway in terms of administrative supervision and technology. These 15 people were indeed overworked and understaffed. The reason why the navigation marks in the Yangtze River were able to be maintained was due to the fact that the experience level of each of these members was very high. There are currently 14 clerks, six of whom are drivers and are still in training.

The local garrison's method of conscripting civilian laborers by ordering district and village chiefs to do so is not good. The district and village chiefs of each district feel unable to cope. Zhang Xueqian, a city councilor from Longhua District, wrote to Mayor Wu, Commander Chen, and General Commander Tang of the Beijing-Shanghai District yesterday, suggesting improving the method of conscripting civilian laborers. He believes that civilian laborers should be given time to rest and eat, the work site should not be too far from their homes, all tools should be supplied by the competent authorities, and meal money should be appropriately subsidized to alleviate the people's difficulties.

### CCP Radio Station Quotes Ding Ling's Old Manuscript to Vigorously Criticize Shanghai Comprador Culture

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco, 110th Broadcast: The CCP radio station in northern Shaanxi today used the topic "Talking to Young Friends About Old Influences" and quoted the manuscript of the speech "Old Influences" by the famous CCP female writer Ding Ling in Harbin.

### An Anonymous Gentleman Generously Donates to Help the Poor and Needy, Generously Donates One Million Gold Yuan to Help Students, Calls on All Sectors to Follow Suit

Our newspaper's "Reading and Helping Students Fund" for the spring of the 38th year has been fundraising for more than a month. The original goal of 500 dan of rice has not yet been half-raised. We are worried about many poor and needy students. We are preparing to issue application forms to various schools these days. According to the amount raised, only 150 college and high school students can be allocated, which is less than one-third of the original goal. In terms of the amount, it is the lowest record in the ten years that our newspaper has advocated helping students. Yesterday, our newspaper reporter happened to talk about this matter with an anonymous gentleman, and he generously agreed to donate one million gold yuan. Adding it to the donations from all parties in the past, it is enough to raise 250 dan of rice. He also wants to throw a brick to attract jade and call on all parties to donate another 250 dan to make it 500 dan and complete the planned goal for this year. This "anonymous" gentleman has been enthusiastic about helping students for ten years, and has donated countless amounts to the News and Ta Kung Pao student aid funds. More than a thousand poor and needy students have benefited. He has never revealed his real name or sought false fame. We respectfully call him the "Old Man Who Helps Students," which is truly a name that matches the reality and is by no means an exaggeration. The following is the old man's handwritten letter:

"To the editor, I have learned that your newspaper has held student aid funds for poor and needy students in the past, and each year it has been able to exceed the planned goal, which has benefited students greatly. Yesterday, Mr. Huang Jiping of the social service department of your newspaper came to my house and talked to me about the current situation of fundraising for this year's student aid fund. The original plan was 500 dan of rice, or 5 million gold yuan, and it was expected that 400-500 poor and needy college and high school students could be helped. Unexpectedly, as of today (February 19th), only 1.5 million gold yuan has been raised. It is intended to contact famous parties for fundraising in order to achieve the goal of reaching the planned goal, etc. I express my deep sympathy for poor and needy students. In this environment of limited ability, I barely managed to raise 1 million gold yuan. I know that it is a drop in the bucket and will not help much, but it is enough to make up half of the planned goal of your newspaper. Fortunately, your newspaper's performance is well-known. Continue to appeal to readers. There is no shortage of kind and sympathetic people in Shanghai who will reach out to help. Not to mention that it is still half of the original goal, it is not difficult to achieve, and it is possible to exceed the planned goal. The poor and needy students are fortunate, the society is fortunate. Anonymous respectfully, February 20th.

### Children's Welfare Promotion Association Hopes for Enthusiastic Donations from All Sectors

Launches Movement to Hire Doctors and Nurses

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association has been deeply praised by all sectors since the exhibition of achievements was held, for its hard work in seeking welfare for more than 10,000 orphaned children in this city. It is now heard that the association is feeling deeply economically difficult due to the rising prices. The association's expenses for this month are about 1 million yuan, and the expenditure is far from sufficient. It is hoped that all sectors can enthusiastically donate. In addition, the association plans to distribute a large number of medical supplies to 1,304 children in 16 children's education and care institutions in this city this month. However, these institutions lack doctors and nurses, so the association has launched a movement to hire doctors and nurses, planning to hire four doctors and four nurses. Each doctor and nurse will be responsible for the medical work of four institutions, and the average monthly salary for each person is three dan of rice. Enthusiastic people from all walks of life are welcome to donate monthly. The association's address: 2nd Floor, No. 599 Sichuan Middle Road, telephone 99433.

### Just Released from Prison, Steals Again, Pharmacy Employee Suspended from Duty, Steals After Failing to Borrow Money

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] At about 11:00 am on the 14th, Yuan Zhi, an employee of the Lida Pharmacy at No. 100 Qunnan Middle Road, reported to the Laoza Police Precinct that he discovered that his house had been pried open and entered at 5:00 am on the same day, and 619 bottles of various Western medicines were stolen, estimated to be worth 380,000 gold yuan, and requested an investigation. Section Chief Zhang Kuidong ordered officers Tang Zhiliang, Li Minsheng, Police Chief Liu Zongtong, Miao Dejin, and Xu Guizhu to go to investigate. It was then learned that a former employee, Huang Min, also known as Yaozhong, had been suspended from duty for misconduct. In December of last year, he had colluded with Zhao Guanfu to rob Western medicines in the Sato Hospital at No. 35 Guangyu Lane, Lintong Road. He was subsequently arrested and sentenced by the Yangshupu Precinct and had just been released recently. He had gone to the pharmacy to ask for a loan but failed. As a result of the investigation, Huang Min was suspected of being heavily involved. Therefore, at 3:00 pm, he was arrested. He initially tried to deny it, but after repeated and exhaustive questioning, Huang finally admitted to the theft. But he was unusually cunning, saying that the stolen goods had been handed over to Liu Dechang, who was gone without a trace, and often hid in the Ningxing or Far East Hotels. After being escorted to the above-mentioned two hotels for investigation, no one was found. All the information provided was fabricated. After speculation, it was decided that the major case was not committed by one person alone, and that his accomplice Zhao Guanfu had a criminal record in the past. It was certain that he had joined in the theft this time. It was also learned that Zhao lived in Chenjiaqiao No. 6, Pudong, and that Zhao had an older sister, Zhao Jinfeng, who lived at No. 10 Sanduo Lane, Jiaozhou Road. They went to the address and found part of the stolen goods. Zhao's second sister lived in the Shenxin No. 9 Factory workshop. The original handlers went to the Shenxin workshop again and found another part of the factory goods, and arrested the suspects who were harboring the stolen goods together to the bureau for strict questioning. Later, they confessed that Zhao Guanfu was acting at No. 6 Chenjiaqiao, Pudong. The Criminal Police Chief Liu Zongtong and Officer Xu Guizhu were sent to arrest the criminals and bring them to the bureau. They confessed that they had committed the theft together without denial. This case has been fully investigated and is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation.

### Mayor Investigates, Rice Dumping Accounts, 600,000 Shopping Certificates, Rice Merchants Say They Will Submit Today

### Just Out of Prison, Steals Again, Pharmacy Employee Suspended from Duty, Steals After Failing to Borrow Money

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] At about 11:00 am on the 14th, Yuan Zhi, an employee of the Lida Pharmacy at No. 100 Qunnan Middle Road, reported to the Laoza Police Precinct that he discovered that his house had been pried open and entered at 5:00 am on the same day, and 619 bottles of various Western medicines were stolen, estimated to be worth 380,000 gold yuan, and requested an investigation. Section Chief Zhang Kuidong ordered officers Tang Zhiliang, Li Minsheng, Police Chief Liu Zongtong, Miao Dejin, and Xu Guizhu to go to investigate. It was then learned that a former employee, Huang Min, also known as Yaozhong, had been suspended from duty for misconduct. In December of last year, he had colluded with Zhao Guanfu to rob Western medicines in the Sato Hospital at No. 35 Guangyu Lane, Lintong Road. He was subsequently arrested and sentenced by the Yangshupu Precinct and had just been released recently. He had gone to the pharmacy to ask for a loan but failed. As a result of the investigation, Huang Min was suspected of being heavily involved. Therefore, at 3:00 pm, he was arrested. He initially tried to deny it, but after repeated and exhaustive questioning, Huang finally admitted to the theft. But he was unusually cunning, saying that the stolen goods had been handed over to Liu Dechang, who was gone without a trace, and often hid in the Ningxing or Far East Hotels. After being escorted to the above-mentioned two hotels for investigation, no one was found. All the information provided was fabricated. After speculation, it was decided that the major case was not committed by one person alone, and that his accomplice Zhao Guanfu had a criminal record in the past. It was certain that he had joined in the theft this time. It was also learned that Zhao lived in Chenjiaqiao No. 6, Pudong, and that Zhao had an older sister, Zhao Jinfeng, who lived at No. 10 Sanduo Lane, Jiaozhou Road. They went to the address and found part of the stolen goods. Zhao's second sister lived in the Shenxin No. 9 Factory workshop. The original handlers went to the Shenxin workshop again and found another part of the factory goods, and arrested the suspects who were harboring the stolen goods together to the bureau for strict questioning. Later, they confessed that Zhao Guanfu was acting at No. 6 Chenjiaqiao, Pudong. The Criminal Police Chief Liu Zongtong and Officer Xu Guizhu were sent to arrest the criminals and bring them to the bureau. They confessed that they had committed the theft together without denial. This case has been fully investigated and is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation.

### Tenants of Donghua Building Appeal Against Eviction

There are more than 40 households living in the Donghua Building (formerly known as Luo Chung Court) at No. 462 Zhejiang Middle Road in this city, from the second to the fifth floor. They have all been renting from Donghua Enterprise Company for many years (of which the five-story area was built by the tenants themselves, turning the platform into houses). Last year, Zhang Zhongquan of Junyi Company came forward, in the capacity of the main landlord, to file a lawsuit against Yonghua Company (the original tenant before Donghua Company) to recover the houses. Because Yonghua Company did not appear in court, Zhang Zhongquan won the lawsuit by default. Afterwards, he filed lawsuits against the tenants in batches, requesting a court order for eviction. The tenants were all defeated in succession, except for the three families of Lian Company on the third floor, who won the retrial in the High Court. Other floors are also in the process of filing appeals and are awaiting hearing. Recently, Zhang Zhongquan applied to the court for enforcement of the eviction in order to re-let them at a higher price. After the tenants requested to renew their leases, Zhang also proposed harsh conditions. The tenants, who are mostly proletarians, are inevitably overwhelmed. They are deeply worried that they will have no place to live in the future and are anxiously awaiting. Currently, all the tenants are collectively petitioning various agencies and appealing against the eviction.

### Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Discusses Basic Education: Eliminating Illiteracy and Building a New Jiangsu; Making Full Efforts to Promote and Decides to Use Shanghai as a Demonstration County

[Reported by our newspaper] The Jiangsu Provincial Government is currently making full efforts to promote basic education and has decided to use Shanghai as a demonstration county. Regarding this issue, our Zhenjiang reporter made a special trip to the Provincial Office to interview Chairman Ding Zhipan, who spoke eloquently for more than an hour. He began by saying, "I am a soldier by profession. The chaos in China today is due to a lack of basic education. According to statistics from the highest education authorities, more than 80% of the Chinese people are still illiterate. They are all stuck in a semi-primitive state of ignorance. These many people, on the one hand, are prone to being taken advantage of due to 'ignorance', unknowingly creating all the contradictions in today's society. On the other hand, they are also 'unable' to cooperate with the government's construction responsibilities, thus prolonging the process of national construction. In my opinion, to build society and eliminate the source of chaos, it is necessary to start with the implementation of the minimum level of basic education in order to break through these barriers."

To Transform from the Root

Ding said that Jiangsu's education and culture have always been known for their development in the past, and all educational facilities often affect the education of the whole country. Now that the national crisis has not yet been resolved, after taking office, in order to realize the ideal of a new Jiangsu, we must transform it from the ground up, starting with the education of "people", which is a fundamental policy. At this point, Ding told a story to the reporter, saying: "Ding County in Hebei and Zouping in Shandong, because these two places have left indelible glorious deeds in the history of local autonomy. Ding County used the 'three methods' to test the 'four educations' and complete the 'six constructions'. Zouping used the educational activities of 'xiangxue' and 'cunxue' as the center of promoting rural construction. They all started with education and gradually cultivated the people's ability to 'manage, educate, raise, and defend', and later the results were very amazing."

Spirit and Practices

What are the spirit and practices of basic education? Ding told reporters in great detail: "First, it can improve the quality of the people and lay the foundation for national culture, because national culture is a measure of the strength of a country, especially in today's era of scientific development, the improvement of cultural level is an urgent task. In the basic education demonstration counties and demonstration areas, we have decided to step up the implementation of compulsory education and remedial education in order to eliminate illiteracy. Second, it can promote local autonomy and establish a national political foundation. Grassroots politics are extremely important. Only when the people are organized can they exert their strength. At the same time, the baojia chiefs are closest to the people, and whether they can faithfully implement government orders is truly related to the future of the country. In the basic education demonstration counties and districts, we must cultivate cadres, assist in organizing and training the people, and assist in the smooth promotion of the police district system. Third, vigorously promote production and construction to consolidate the national economic foundation. National wealth comes from the wealth of the people. This is an unbreakable principle. At present, the bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of people's livelihoods in our country are all the result of backward production capacity. In the basic education demonstration counties and districts, we must cooperate with production plans and use the dissemination of scientific knowledge as a means to enable the people to engage in production increase by scientific methods, thereby improving the people's living skills."

Finally, Ding said in a very relaxed tone: "I hope that his basic education proposition can not only be implemented in every corner of Jiangsu Province, but also gradually become a national demonstration."

### Import and Export Management Committee Encourages Sales to Japan for Cash

[Reported by our newspaper] The Sino-Japanese trade, which was partially opened by the government last year, allows merchants to participate. However, before the peace treaty is signed, it is temporarily based on barter. Since July of last year, the results of barter have been considerable. Trade figures have been disclosed by the Import and Export Management Committee. The committee now believes that sales to Japan for cash can increase my country's foreign exchange income and should be encouraged. After repeated consultations with the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the method has been determined as follows:

(1) Any merchant who intends to sell goods to Japan for cash should first submit the sales contract to the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan for approval.

(2) When the merchant exports goods, he shall fill out an export settlement certificate, attach a letter of credit issued by the Japanese side, and sell foreign exchange to the designated bank in accordance with the regulations, and the designated bank shall certify it.

(3) When the merchant applies for export in Shanghai, he shall prepare a letter together with the export settlement certificate certified by the designated bank mentioned above and the sales contract approved by the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan, and submit it to the First Group of the Shanghai Office of the Import and Export Management Committee for verification and signature, and then take it to the customs for inspection and release. When applying for export at other ports, the above-mentioned certificates and contracts shall be submitted to the office of the association in the area where it is located.

Furthermore, regarding trade from Japan to China, before the new method of trade with Japan is approved and implemented by the government, except for those specially approved for barter, it is still temporarily prohibited.

### No Major Changes in Export Commodity Price Limits This Week

### Woolen Fabric Costs Increase

Recently, woolen fabric manufacturers in Shanghai have been feeling depressed, mainly because raw materials are expensive and difficult to obtain. Electricity and coal prices are soaring, and the cost of living continues to rise, increasing costs day by day. The manufacturing process is prolonged. From the time the wool strips are put on the spinning wheel to the time the finished product is sorted, even a textile factory with complete equipment requires three to five months. Ordinary manufacturers who entrust others to spin and sort for them need to extend the time further, and funds are often slow to turn around. Borrowing high-interest loans to solve the problem is like drinking poison to quench thirst. In addition, due to environmental factors, sales continue to decline, and market prices are often lower than costs.

### Timber Costs Are Not Enough

Although the timber market has been rising steadily since the lunar new year, market prices have not reached their peak in terms of cost. For example, the overseas price of foreign pine is 15.5 cents per foot, which requires 248 yuan based on an exchange rate of 1,600 yuan. Adding ad valorem customs duties and profits, the cost is at least 350 yuan or more. The current market price is 160 to 170 yuan at the highest, but those seeking cash are selling for 130 yuan, and the general price is 140 to 150 yuan. In addition, the price of fir wood at the place of origin is 35 yuan, plus 70 to 80 percent exchange losses and transportation and transfer fees, the cost is at least 60 yuan per foot. The market price is only 50 yuan, which is not enough to cover the costs. This is really due to the problem of actual sales.

(2) Tiandu Mine: It has two ore bodies, east and west, with a total ore reserve of 4,800,000 tons, of which 2,600,000 tons have been extracted by the Japanese. Since its establishment, the bureau has mined approximately 25,000 tons, and the current remaining reserves are 1,950,000 tons. (3) Ore Quality: Primarily hematite, with minor limonite. The average composition is about 64%, and other harmful components such as sulfur and copper are minimal, making it the best in our country. (4) Mining Methods: (A) Churn drills: A hole is drilled every three meters, with depths ranging from nine to twenty meters. Each hole can blast approximately 3,000 metric tons of ore. (B) Room and pillar blasting. (C) Pneumatic drilling: Currently, there are B74 and B39 pneumatic drills. (5) Mining Records: According to past records using churn drills and room and pillar blasting methods, each worker could extract 20-60,000 tons, with a consumption of 0-18 of explosives per ton. If pneumatic drills are used, each worker can only extract 5 tons, with an explosives consumption of 0-35 pounds. (6) Ore Processing Procedures: On each level of the mine, ore is manually loaded onto cars and transported to the vertical shaft openings on each level, then sent to the underground main transportation tunnel, using a 10,000-ton belt conveyor to load the ore cars (each loading 15 cars takes 20 minutes). The ore cars are then transported along an 11.8-kilometer railway to the Anyou ore storage belt conveyor for loading onto ships (capable of loading 400 to 700 tons of ore per hour). The Hainan Iron Mine Bureau previously had an annual contract with a British trading company, selling the ore at a price of seven US dollars per ton. Since February of last year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been responsible for transporting the ore until the end of the year, with a total of 293,083.35 tons transported. The first batch of the contract, 250,000 tons, was completed in mid-January of the 37th year [of the Republic]. The contract was continuously renewed, and as of the time of this writing, 46,601.8 metric tons have been transported. Currently, the staff of the Iron Mine Bureau here are very diligent, maintaining a lifeline for the industrial and mining enterprises of South China. At a time when the industrial and mining enterprises of the Northeast are almost at a standstill, the position of the Hainan Iron Mine Bureau is even more significant. The Iron Mine is emphasizing the "new steel capital of Qiong Island." We hope that the Hainan Iron Mine Bureau will actively develop and achieve the goals of developing resources and building Qiongya [Hainan].

In addition, the Shilu Iron Mine in western Hainan is also managed by the Hainan Iron Mine Bureau. However, it is said that the mineral deposits here are even richer than those of Tiandu, but due to security concerns, resumption of work and mining have not yet been possible. Furthermore, the Dongfang Hydroelectric Project in Changjiang is also very grand and is the only treasure on Qiong Island, previously managed by the Hainan Power Plant. In August of last year, due to financial difficulties at the power plant, it was ordered to close and was handed over to the Iron Mine Bureau for safekeeping. If security cannot be improved and the Shilu Iron Mine cannot be mined, then the Dongfang Hydroelectric Plant is merely fulfilling its nominal role of safekeeping, and the electrification of the entire Qiong Island is still a long way off.

Jin Lusheng cut in, and Gao Zhiwen pounced. Jin lifted the ball over Gao Zhiwen's head, and Gu Yisa rushed up, calmly scoring, one to zero, taking the lead. Afterwards, Xue Peiran and Xiao Luo had several shots, but none were successful. Jingwu controlled the midfield effectively, but struggled to overcome Meng Yiliang's strong defense. In a rare offensive, Wu Jingren passed to the left, and Fang Jiquiu shot wide from close range. Before the end of the first half, Huang Lipu committed a handball in the penalty area, and Jin Lusheng took the penalty kick, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Qingbai won the first half by one goal.

### Qunli Displays Power: Defeats Zhenru Ten to One

In the first week of the Mayor's Cup football tournament, Qunli vs. Zhenru took place at 10:00 AM yesterday at Yi Park, with only a few spectators. Qunli displayed its power, winning decisively by a score of ten to one. The first half ended with a score of two to zero, and Zhenru completely collapsed in the second half.

Zhenru took the offensive first, and the two sides were deadlocked. In the thirty-eighth minute, Wang Lianhai fouled in the penalty area, and Chen Longquan scored the penalty kick. Before long, Wang Xingbang followed suit, fouling in the penalty area again, and Chen Longquan scored again, bagging a brace. In the first half, Qunli won by two penalty kicks. When sides were changed again, Qunli's offensive was fierce. Yao Jihua's shot hit the crossbar and bounced out, and Hu Nanhai added a kick, making it three to zero. Lu Fangkui crossed from the baseline, and Chen Longquan shot, scoring again. Hu Fuhai took a corner kick, and Yao Jihua headed it into the net. Before long, Chen Longquan picked up an open goal, making it six to zero. Zhenru struggled to defend, while Qunli advanced like a broken bamboo, scoring one after another. Tao Jihua received a pass from behind, rushed into the new pass, making it seven to zero. At this point, the Qunli team had mercy on their feet. Before long, Zhenru Wang Yu passed to Wang Yubang, who shot and scored. Zhenru scored this goal, avoiding a shutout.

### Basketball League: Internal Strife, Two Fast Teams Clash, Renyu Fights Hard to Overcome Hujing

[Report from This Newspaper] The fourth Basketball League has entered a tense stage. Last night's Group A match between Hujing (formerly Chenyou) and Renyu was nothing short of internal strife. Both sides possessed good players and played at a fast pace. After forty minutes of intense competition, Renyu surprisingly overwhelmed Hujing by a score of 43 to 36. The first half ended with a score of 20 to 14. Renyu's players were adept at both offense and defense, with balanced development. Xu Zhongyi was particularly lively. If merits were to be rewarded, he would always be in first place. Hujing appeared flustered, but Renyu missed many opportunities with free throws. In another match, the women's team Li defeated Xinghua, 40 to 37. In a friendly match for men, Donghua defeated Hongqi, 47 to 39. The battle situations in each match are as follows:

Li Team Defeats Xinghua, Wang Shan Supports the Remnants

In the women's match between the Li team and Xinghua, the Li team's forwards were unstoppable in the first quarter. Qian Youping's back was imprinted with the Xinghua defenders' plasters, two patches of blood red, which were even more vivid and eye-catching on the light yellow jersey. In this quarter, the Li team's young players gained an advantage with a score of 18 to 13. In the second quarter, Xinghua tried to catch up and surpass, but soon the Li team recovered and eventually won by half a point with a score of 24 to 23.

Xinghua is the embodiment of whiteness, and was indeed a very good team in the past, always posing a threat to the Green team, the leader of the Shanghai women's basketball league. Unfortunately, they have had little collective practice recently and have lost their touch. In the third quarter, the score was 34 to 27, still in their disadvantage. In the last quarter, Xinghua's Wang Shan struggled to support the remnants, with stable shooting. With forty to thirty-five, there was still one and a half minutes left. The Li team saw that the situation was not good and used a slow, attrition-based strategy. As a result, the score was forty to thirty-seven. Xinghua was upset, and the Li team cheered.

Friendly Match, Donghua Defeats Hongqi

In the friendly match between Donghua and Hongqi, both sides moved very quickly. In the first half, Hongqi had 23 points, and Donghua had 18. The battle situation in the first half was turbulent, with scores fluctuating. Donghua's shooting was even more comprehensive. Hongqi was brave but had too many loopholes. In the last minute, Han Longhai committed his fifth foul and had only four players left. The final score was 47 to 39, and Hongqi was defeated.

Originally from the Same Root: Renyu Breaks Hujing

Hujing (Chenyou)'s players are: Wang Rongsheng, Chuan Qixia, Shi Jiuquan, He Zeng, Wang Bowen. Renyu's players are: Cai Jindian, Li He, Xu Zhongyi, Shen Pengju, Wang Huaiting. They are brothers fighting each other. In the first four minutes, both sides scored two points each. From then on, Renyu's He and Jindian scored one after another. At ten minutes, they maintained a one-sided situation of seven to two. Cai Fuzeng scored a goal, which was extremely strange. Rongsheng and Xiong Biao painted a picture of peace, but the former wasted all four free throws. Commendable, but Renyu's A Cai and Zhongyi scored consecutive baskets, 18 to 8. Hujing only relied on free throws to score. Since He Jingui and Xiong Biao replaced Jindian and Bowen, there was no improvement. The first half ended with Renyu leading by six points, 20 to 14.

In the second half, the main players of both teams, Bowen and Zhongyi, each scored two goals at the beginning. Bowen made a free throw, and A Liang followed up, making it 24 to 21, gradually getting closer. Jindian was replaced by Huaiting, and Wenyi replaced Pengju. Hujing's Jingui scored a basket, and Rongsheng also scored from the periphery, taking the lead 25 to 24. Guo Zheng, Bowen, and Xin Yun each displayed their special skills, and the score was tied twice at 26 and 28. He Zeng replaced Qixia, Pengju replaced Wenyi, Xin Yun scored two free throws, leading by two points again. Zhongyi adjusted Guo Zheng, and Huaiting replaced Jindian. The other side, Jingui, also scored two free throws, not allowing the score to remain tied at 30. Huaiting missed a free throw, which the audience regretted. Fortunately, Xu Zhongyi made up for it with a goal, Xin Yun made it 34 to 30. The actions of both sides became increasingly heated, and the formations were frequently changed. Renyu had many free throws that they didn't take advantage of. Xin Yun's sprint, with throws and fouls, made it 37 to 31. There were still four minutes left, Jingui scored. Rongsheng stole, still two points behind. Zhaohe retaliated with a goal, four points ahead. In the last two minutes, Jindian replaced Zhaohe, Jingui added a point for Hujing, Renyu's Zhongyi broke through again, and Pengju's last contribution ended the game, 43 to 36. Hujing (Chenyou) lost for the first time.

### Overseas Chinese Brew a National Salvation Movement

Reporter of This Newspaper

[Hague, 12th Dispatch] Recently, patriotic overseas Chinese residing in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas, lamenting that China's international status as one of the five major powers has greatly diminished due to internal strife after the victory against Japan, even to the point of being ridiculed by countries such as the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, attribute the cause to the incessant civil wars in our country, which have led to a decline in population and national strength. Ultimately, they trace the root cause to falling into the "using Chinese to control Chinese" deceit and conspiracy of other countries to weaken China; therefore, they believe that it is urgently necessary to seek transcendence and extricate ourselves, lest we continue to be fooled by others until the country is destroyed and the race is extinct without even realizing it. In order to save China from danger and destruction, relieve the suffering of compatriots, and safeguard the acquired international status as one of the five major powers, they are now brewing the organization of a "Global Patriotic Overseas Chinese National Salvation Grand Alliance" to awaken all overseas Chinese around the world, to unite and rise up together, to call for peace, and to jointly save the motherland.

The declaration of the "Global Patriotic Overseas Chinese National Salvation Grand Alliance" (entitled "Overseas Chinese and the Motherland") and its organizational measures, which are currently being brewed, are as follows:

The Republic of China

Is the motherland of us all, therefore all citizens of the Republic of China residing abroad are simply referred to as "overseas Chinese."

The Republic of China was created by the National Revolution, and the National Revolution was initiated, supported, and assisted by the overseas Chinese led by the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen; therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen is the Father of China, and the overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.

We can say that without the National Revolution, we could not have overthrown the rule of the Manchu Qing, a foreign race from the north at that time, nor could we have established the Republic of China that we all share now.

At the same time, if it were not for the National Revolution, we would not have been able to defeat imperialism, eliminate warlords, recover concessions, resist Japan, abolish unequal treaties, and make China one of the five major powers.

In the past forty years, every time the National Revolution progressed a step, our country's status rose a level, our compatriots at home and abroad looked better, and everyone's mood was more pleasant.

We should ask: Why does the National Revolution have such great power and achieve such great results?

This is because the Father of the Nation said: "The purpose of the National Revolution is to seek the welfare of the citizens of the Republic of China," to seek freedom and equality for China, and to realize the ideal of world harmony.

The spirit of the National Revolution is entrusted to the Three Principles of the People created by the Father of the Nation:

(1) Using nationalism to "expel the Tartars and restore China," overthrowing the rule of foreign races that conquered China, returning China's sovereignty to the hands of the Chinese people, and the territory of China should be wholly owned by the Chinese people. At the same time, it advocates that all ethnic groups in the country should be equal in status, and sympathizes with any weak and oppressed ethnic countries and helps them liberate and revive.

(2) Using the principle of democracy to teach the Chinese people how to assemble, how to elect, how to impeach, how to initiate, and how to hold referendums, and then formulate a constitution so that all citizens of the country are equal to each other, have freedom, and can participate in politics.

(3) Using the principle of people's livelihood to equalize land ownership, regulate capital, increase food and clothing production, and build houses and transportation to make China rich, strong, prosperous, and happy.

Because the Three Principles of the People were created by the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, they are most suitable for China and are most welcomed by the Chinese people. Not only do the overseas Chinese support them, but also many compatriots in the country support them. Therefore, the movement of the National Revolution can develop very quickly and achieve great success.

After China defeated Japan, it became one of the five major powers in the world. Recalling the time of victory, how excited and happy were the compatriots at home and the overseas Chinese, and all harbored infinite hope for the future of the motherland.

But three years later, China's international status as one of the five major powers is only in name. Not only has the Soviet Union already looked down on us, but other countries now do not treat us as a major power. What is the reason for this?

Some people say that this is due to the rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party, while others say that this is due to the incompetence of the government.

But from the perspective of us overseas Chinese, everything is still because both sides fell for the "using Chinese to control Chinese" strategy of other countries after the war, weakening China without a fight, causing us to kill each other, while they reaped the benefits.

Chinese compatriots are killing each other, reducing the population and weakening national strength, of course losing the good reputation they had at the end of the war.

After the war, other countries buried themselves in construction and tried to revive, but our China, which had already been more arduous than any other country in the eight years of resisting Japan, still had to continue with wars. Isn't this too incomprehensible?

If there had been no wars in the country in the past three years, and all parties could have unanimously formed armies composed of all the strong compatriots, and sent them to the east, south, west, and north to strengthen border defenses, and at the same time used the remaining resources after the war to build and prepare to recover the newly struggled for and should have been recovered Chinese territories, China could have become a truly worthy one of the five major powers, and the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States would not have ridiculed China as they do today.

What is past cannot be remedied, but what is to come can still be pursued. In order to save the motherland from danger, to relieve the suffering of compatriots, and to safeguard the acquired international status as one of the five major powers, we overseas Chinese should urgently and loudly call for:

(1) Immediately and promptly stop the civil war of Chinese compatriots killing each other, and extricate ourselves as soon as possible and strive to avoid any conspiracy or trap of other countries to "use Chinese to control Chinese" and weaken our China.

(2) Continue the Father of the Nation's legacy of saving the country, implement the Three Principles of the People, complete the National Revolution, and realize the ideal of governing China with the principles of the Chinese people, without being directly or indirectly controlled by any foreign race.

(3) Since the purpose of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for the motherland and seek the welfare of all compatriots, and the National Revolution has created the Republic of China, making China one of the five major powers, therefore, any government that directly relies on the strength of other countries to grow or is indirectly controlled by other countries is a government that opposes the National Revolution. We believe that compatriots at home and abroad will resolutely oppose it to the death.

The overseas Chinese are the mother of the National Revolution. Everyone has a personal stake in the rise and fall, strength and weakness of the Republic of China and must not ignore it. We believe that the true prerequisite for the Republic of China to be strong and prosperous is that the above three points must be achieved; otherwise, it is heading for decline and destruction, or willingly becoming another person's vassal state. This is the fatal heartache and unparalleled humiliation of the Chinese nation.

Patriotic overseas Chinese, let us all unite and form a Global Patriotic Overseas Chinese National Salvation Grand Alliance to save the endangered motherland and our compatriots, following in the footsteps of the Father of the Nation. The organizational measures (draft) of the Grand Alliance are recorded as follows:

National Salvation Guidelines

(1) Call on both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to immediately stop the wars of Chinese compatriots killing each other, and extricate ourselves as soon as possible and strive to avoid any conspiracy or trap of any country to "use Chinese to control Chinese" and weaken our China. (2) Continue the Father of the Nation's legacy of saving the country, implement the Three Principles of the People, complete the National Revolution, and realize the principle of governing China with the principles of the Chinese people, without being controlled by any foreign race. (3) Since the purpose of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China and seek the welfare of all compatriots, and the achievements of the National Revolution have overthrown the Manchu Qing, established the Republic, eliminated warlords, defeated imperialism, recovered concessions, resisted Japan, abolished unequal treaties in the past, and made China one of the five major powers, therefore, any government that directly relies on the strength of other countries to grow or is indirectly controlled by other countries is a government that opposes the National Revolution and is opposed to the death by our compatriots at home and abroad.

### The Yangtze's Projecting Tongue - Chongming

— Qiuyang

[Chongming, 10th Day of Autumn Sun] If the Yangtze River can be said to be China's treasury, then Chongming is its projecting tongue. Though this island's history is not long, its geographical position is quite important. It can be said to be China's front door. Unfortunately, it has no natural defenses, being an alluvial plain. But if China had a large navy, this could still be a good harbor.

Without Chong, No Stage

The entire population of Chongming County, according to official statistics, is approximately 460,000. The main products are rice, beans, and cotton, but the food supply is not sufficient for even two or three months. The exact figures are unknown due to lack of accurate statistics, so it is impossible to deduce the true situation. Due to the food shortage, most of the residents here seek opportunities elsewhere. Perhaps due to its geographical proximity to Shanghai, their occupations are mostly concentrated in navigation, telecommunications, and textiles. Every China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship has Chongming sailors; "Without Chong, No Stage," which shows the development of Chongming people in this area.

The Fort Towns Are the Most Prosperous

Chongming Island is about 180 *li* (approximately 60 miles) long from east to west, and the widest part from north to south is about 30 *li* (approximately 10 miles). There are no mountains on the island, but there is a small river every three *li* (approximately 1 mile). The most prosperous commerce is in the fort towns, followed by the bridge towns. The commerce in Chongming city is very desolate and bleak. Besides a few rice shops and hot water vendors, there are almost no decent stores to be seen. Because of the climate, the residences and shops here are mostly single-story buildings, with the highest being no more than four stories.

Low Cultural Level

What is questionable is that while transportation here is very convenient, cultural undertakings are quite backward. There are three newspapers, all small-sized octavo news sheets. The editing and printing all seem to fall short of standards. The books in the library are mostly outdated and propaganda from the Executive Yuan Information Bureau. There are no bookstores or newspaper distribution agencies. It is very difficult to read a newspaper or magazine you want to read here. A Shanghai newspaper costs an exorbitant price from vendors, even more than double the Shanghai price.

"Small Country with Few People"

However, the cultural level here does not seem to be inferior to that of the mainland. There are more than a dozen middle schools here. Generally speaking, the level of knowledge of the people is not considered low. The people here mostly have a custom of collecting books. The folk customs are simple and honest. When you come into contact with them, there is only sincerity, without any pretense. Living here is like returning to a "small country with few people" society. You really don't know what era it is, with a strong flavor of Shangri-La, even though this is the cutting edge of the struggle between two forces.

Ancient Sages in Their Seventies

Most people who have been to Chongming know that there are two "sages" here. Out of curiosity, I once visited the home of the sages. Their home is near the west of the city. Deep in the bamboo fence, several tile-roofed houses are faintly visible. "Although there is a door, it is always closed." The two old gentlemen are both over seventy years old. They are often away from home. Although their past actions were different, now they both "have a *pu tuan* cushion and a lamp," to nurture their remaining years. One lives in the Suzhou Release Pond, and the other lives in the Chongming countryside. Mr. Li Jue Wu was formerly a soldier who served as a battalion commander during the era of the Northern Warlords. He made outstanding contributions in the Qi-Lu War, but precisely because of this, he seemed to have a Huangliang dream (a dream of empty glory). He watched many of his beloved brothers disappear in the fierce fighting, and other people's brothers fell one by one. At this time, he realized why his compatriots were killing each other like this. From this time on, he left the army, re-verified good results, changed his name to "Yi Jue" (One Awakening), and styled himself "Jue Wu" (Awakening Myself). From his name, it is not difficult for us to see the transformation of Mr. Li's thinking. This transformation is the watershed of Mr. Li's personality and morality, and also a major reason why Mr. Li is hailed as one of the sages.

Advanced Revolutionary

Mr. Cai Shen Fu is an advanced revolutionary. In his early years, he studied in Japan, followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and engaged in secret activities. Under the corrupt and incompetent Qing court's autocratic power, he often held secret meetings, trained party members, and made great contributions to the revolution. He was upright and had the spirit of an ancient chivalrous hero. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese occupied Chongming County, Mr. Cai lived in a rural villa. He did not enter the city until the Japanese army left Chongming, showing his patriotism. The gentleman was unrestrained and did not engage in family production. One year, he bought lottery tickets and won a huge sum of money, but he soon scattered it all. It is said that his wife only received eight yuan. His public-mindedness and selflessness can be seen from this. Although the gentleman is over seventy years old, his spirit is still vigorous, and he often walks dozens of *li* without fatigue. The two gentlemen now both eat vegetarian food and chant Buddhist scriptures. They both seem to have seen through life, but it is also because they have not found true answers to life's questions.

Blowing the Charge Horn Himself

Mr. Li's second son was killed in action in Guide during the Anti-Japanese War. It is said that Mr. Li's son was a battalion commander at this time. When the battalion bugler was killed in action, Mr. Li blew the charge horn himself and died for his country. His heroic spirit is also very admirable!

The Yangtze River flows turbulently to the boundless coast, and the simple and honest people of Chongming also stand quietly in the endless flow of time. May Chongming Island be blessed to live such a peaceful and harmonious life forever.

### Hangzhou Zhakou Pumping Station, Mechanical Irrigation, Benefiting Farmland Area Up to 100,000 *Mu*

[Central News Agency, 19th] The Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in cooperation with the Hunan and Jiangxi provincial governments, conducted mechanical drainage projects in Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake last November, benefiting a total area of 260,000 *mu*. Now, in order to make full use of the existing pumps, the office signed a contract with the Zhejiang provincial government again in January this year to conduct the Hangzhou Zhakou Pumping Station mechanical irrigation project. According to the plan, the pumping station was originally located on the north bank of the Qiantang River outside Datong Bridge in Zhakou, Hangzhou, divided into the first and second stations. Both stations draw fresh water from the Qiantang River at low tide, and then pass it through the Central River of Hangzhou (11.5 kilometers long), and then inject it into the Shangtang River (46.7 kilometers long) and the Jianqiao River (14.7 kilometers long), to irrigate more than 100,000 *mu* of farmland along the rivers in Hangzhou, Hang County, and Haining and other cities and counties. During the Anti-Japanese War, both pumping stations were destroyed, resulting in the disruption of the water sources of the Shangtang and Jianqiao rivers. Even a slight drought would put the farmers along the rivers at risk of water shortage. In the autumn of 1934 and 1947, Zhejiang Province reported droughts, and the farmland in this area was the most severely affected. In order to reduce the drought disaster, the above-mentioned pumping stations should be restored as soon as possible to facilitate irrigation. The mechanical irrigation project of the pumping station now under consideration will change the two stations into one, in line with the principle of economy. The project plan is divided into two parts: (1) Mechanical part - the Agricultural Reclamation Office will provide nine sets of 11-inch screw-type pumps (including Chrysler 60-horsepower diesel engines and necessary accessories). When fully operational, it is expected to pump 45,000 gallons of water per minute. (2) Civil engineering part - it is planned to build a house with an area of 1,680 square feet near the original site of the first pumping station, with a reinforced concrete reservoir underneath, connected to the water diversion ditch outside the dike. Above the reservoir, ten 20x20-foot reinforced concrete large well holes will be built, with cover plates on the top, and nine pumps will be installed. The remaining one well will be used for workers to go up and down for inspection, with ladders and gates inside. A small ditch will be dug between the pumping station and the inner river to connect them. The total cost of the above-mentioned projects is estimated to be US$46,000, equivalent to 18,400 *shi* (a unit of dry measure) of rice. Among them, the mechanical equipment requires 10,760 *shi* of rice, the water discharge equipment requires 4,400 *shi* of rice, the factory building requires 1,640 *shi* of rice, and the reserve fund requires 1,600 *shi* of rice. This fund will be borne by the Shangtang River Water Conservancy Council, which is established by the relevant cities and counties along the river, and will collect engineering benefit fees from the benefited farmland, to be repaid in eight years. The pumps and engines will be transferred to the benefiting farmers' organizations one year after the irrigation project is completed, so that they can continue to use them. The irrigation project is scheduled to be completed before the end of March this year, so as not to delay the agricultural season. After completion, it will be handed over to the Shangtang River Water Conservancy Council for acceptance, responsible for management, use, and maintenance. It is estimated that the water pumped by the pumping station can meet the irrigation needs of 100,000 *mu* of farmland on both sides of the Shangtang River and the Jianqiao River. From then on, there will be no drought disasters, and rice production will be stable. Moreover, with timely irrigation, there will be increased production. It is calculated that the average annual increase in production is 5 *shi* per *mu*, and the annual increase in production is 50,000 *shi*, which is about three times the total project cost. In peacetime, the power equipment of the station can also be used for agricultural product processing. In addition, the problem of discharging sewage from the Hangzhou city river can also be solved in conjunction, which will be of great benefit to urban sanitation.

### Zhang Qun Talks About the Southwest

— Zhou Xueduan, reporter for this newspaper

[Airmail from Chengdu, this newspaper, 17th] Continuous spring rain, sometimes warm and sometimes cold. On the evening of the 14th, the Phoenix Mountain Airport in the suburbs of Chengdu was temporarily crowded with officials to welcome the newly appointed Director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, Zhang Qun. The first feeling of this central figure in the Southwest situation after getting off the plane was facing so many eager and expectant faces. Indeed, the overall situation is changing, and the Southwest has become the center of national stability. Zhang's return to power in the border administration this time means that the task is more difficult, and his hometown's expectations for him are increasing. In order to repay the local hospitality, he exceptionally made his first speech on the Southwest issue after taking office at two public gatherings.

Sincere Unity, Prepare for Contingencies

Zhang believes that the current situation in the Southwest is "fundamentally not normal but requires contingency plans. The primary way to deal with contingencies is sincere unity among the five provinces and cities in the Southwest. Only with unity can there be strength, and only then will we be able to protect ourselves." He elaborated that since the end of the tutelage period, he has visited the Southwest and North China as a private citizen, and went to Japan for a trip, trying to devote himself to the organization of the Asia Economic Group. However, "the situation is changing, and the national affairs are difficult and dangerous. The central government has given me the mission of pacifying the Southwest. Although I am worried about the difficulty of the task, I cannot but accept the order resolutely and return to Sichuan to overcome hardships and seek self-help and national salvation with the local people, in the spirit of respecting and serving my hometown," and cited Ouyang Xiu as an example of a Jiangxi person who was not buried in his hometown to avoid criticism. "Today, the Southwest is the last bastion of the country. Only with unity and cooperation can we talk about nation-building and revitalization. As for the major plans for peace and war, of course, they are decided by the central government. The local government must not have other plans. There is no reason for 'autonomy,' only 'self-reliance' and 'self-sufficiency' are the only good policies to stabilize the Southwest and revitalize the country."

Frankly Admit Mistakes, Thoroughly Reform

Zhang believes that the current national situation is seriously difficult and dangerous. The reasons for the crisis are that "we cannot simply talk about military failures and ignore the political and economic reasons. For example, the achievements of the Communist Party are not due to the soundness of communism itself or the special ability of the Communist Party, but because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, especially the Principle of People's Livelihood, have not yet been implemented today." "If we had implemented the equalization of land ownership and the regulation of capital of the Principle of People's Livelihood long ago, how could the situation have come to this!" To save the country, he believes that "we should frankly admit our mistakes, thoroughly eliminate the old and bring forth the new, and make a comprehensive and thorough renovation." In the past, when he was in charge of Sichuan, he put forward the slogans of "seeking stability in construction and seeking progress in stability." "Today is an extraordinary period. We must not seek temporary stability, so as to accommodate facts, connect emotions, and perfunctorily deal with personnel. This kind of 'flat' policy is no longer feasible. The only need at present is 'thoroughness,' thorough change, thorough awakening, thorough introspection, and thorough reform!"

Self-Liquidation, Develop People's Power

As for how to innovate? Zhang put forward an alarming slogan: "We must liquidate ourselves, not wait for others to liquidate us, and liquidation is not only about wealth, we must liquidate our thoughts, strength, and all living habits." Zhang believes that the way to reform comprehensively is that "the way to reform is complicated, and the central force to promote it is to unite the people. We must make the people of the Southwest provinces and cities cooperate closely with the government, and the government formulates policies based on the will of the people, expresses the will of the people, and uses the power of the people." In terms of politics, economy, and military affairs, he believes that "local finances depend on the central government and cannot be independent. Taking the Southwest as an example, if Sichuan recovers what the central government recovers, it can still balance financial revenues and expenditures, but Kang, Dian, Qian, and Yu cannot do it. Therefore, economic reforms should consider the environment, study plans, and make comprehensive plans. Politics and military affairs are closely related. The way to reform should be to develop the people's power, increase production, clarify officialdom, and organize local forces."

In summary, Zhang Xueli stayed in Chengdu for three days and made two public speeches. From his speech, we can see his firm belief in stabilizing the Southwest, which is also the current urgent hope of the people of the Southwest.

### Huang Xuchu Returns from Afar, Talks About the Situation

[Airmail from Guilin, this newspaper, 14th] Just when the atmosphere of peace was rising and there were many rumors in Guangxi, Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu quietly flew to Wuhan, went to the capital Beijing and then to Guangzhou, making a journey around the southern half of the country. The task of this trip was, of course, extraordinary.

On the 3rd of this month, Huang left Guilin at the invitation of General Bai, Commander-in-Chief of Central China, and returned to the provincial capital on the 12th. He traveled all the way. After getting off the plane, he drove back to the provincial government to preside over the provincial affairs meeting. Not long after the meeting, the Commander-in-Chief telephoned to inquire about the results of the trip to Guangzhou. It was not until the evening that he could meet with reporters. This was the busiest time for him in recent years. He was very happy with what he saw and heard on this trip. He said: The people's hearts in the capital are stable, and there is no more chaos than in the past. Acting President Li is working hard for peace, following the declaration of President Chiang. The people need peace, the government needs peace, and the Communist Party also needs peace. Everyone is seeking peace, and the prospects for peace are very optimistic. But peace is not empty talk, nor does it need local peace. Speaking of this, he cited Beijing as an example. The daughter of a certain professor at a certain university in the city was studying at a certain university in Beijing. When the Communist army was about to enter Beijing, she wrote a letter saying: "Our bright and free days are coming soon." After the Communist army entered the city, she wrote a letter saying: When writing to her, political issues should not be mentioned. It can be seen that local peace is not true peace.

He also said: The situation is serious, and everyone must unite and persevere in order to make peace. In the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, the Communist army suffered heavy casualties, and then retreated north in order to reorganize and replenish. The focus of this province's work this year is no different from last year, "strengthening organization and training, and ensuring public security" is still the first task. Therefore, he announced that although martial law has been lifted, actions that hinder security are still prohibited.

Finally, he dispelled the rumors, saying: "There are many rumors outside that Guangxi is independent, and Guangdong is going to fight Guangxi. I (referring to Huang) met with Chairman Xue of Guangdong Province in Guangzhou this time. The host and guests were happy, and there were no different words. All measures in this province are completely under the command of the central government." He refuted the rumors as purely unfounded. It is not known what administrative gains Huang's trip has brought, but in terms of clarifying the rumors, it has indeed achieved unexpected results.
