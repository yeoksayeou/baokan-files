### The Executive Yuan Decides Not to Move Back to Nanjing; Sun Ke Officially Denies Resigning; Wu Yuhou and Others Fly to Guangzhou to Report on Their Trip to Beiping; Ye Jianying Visits Yan Huiqing and Others for Talks

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] Executive Yuan President Sun Ke recently told reporters: Rumors that he had submitted his resignation to Acting President Li are purely unfounded. He absolutely denies any talk of resignation, and stated that he has no intention of returning to Zhongshan or going to Macau, and that the date of his return to Nanjing has not yet been decided.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] According to an important responsible person at the Presidential Office, rumors that Executive Yuan President Sun Ke has submitted his resignation to Acting President Li, or that Sun entrusted Presidents Yu and Tong of the two legislative bodies to submit his resignation on his behalf, and various rumors that Huang Shaohong, He Yingqin, and others would form a cabinet, are not true.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Jing Evening News reported that Sun Ke had resigned to Acting President Li, and that Li Hanhun came to Nanjing to submit the resignation on behalf of President Sun. When Li met with reporters on the 16th, he denied this and officially stated that the above news was absolutely untrue.

[Associated Press, Guangzhou, 16th] The Executive Yuan passed a resolution in today's political affairs meeting not to move back to Nanjing.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Wu Yuhou, Wu Zhesheng, Wang Hun, and other members of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation flew from Nanjing to Guangzhou on the Executive Yuan's special plane at 7 a.m. on the 16th, arriving at 2 p.m. that day. They immediately went to the Executive Yuan to visit Secretary-General Duanmu. Due to fatigue from the long flight, they plan to rest briefly and then pay their respects to President Sun and Vice President Wu Tiecheng within the next few days. These first peace envoys to depart obtained President Sun's consent before going to Beiping and flew on the Executive Yuan's special plane. This time, in addition to visiting President Sun, they will also publicly meet with reporters to report on their negotiations with the Chinese Communists in Beiping, the Communist attitude towards peace talks, and the current situation in Beiping.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] Professor Xia Yuanzhi, a member of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation who returned from Beiping, revealed on the 17th that Ye Jianying had agreed in principle that if current peace efforts failed, Nanjing and its people would not be subjected to artillery fire or other war damage. Xia said that Ye Jianying had told him that he would recommend to the Communist high command that Nanjing be spared from war damage under any circumstances. A response may be given in a later broadcast. He said that Ye Jianying suggested that Nanjing should follow the example of the peaceful resolution in Beiping. To this, he replied, "This is impossible because Nanjing's position is different from that of Beiping. It is the capital of China."

[Associated Press, Beiping, 16th] Since the Shanghai People's Peace Delegation, led by Yan Huiqing and others, arrived in Beiping on the 14th, Mayor Ye Jianying and other Communist leaders have visited them, but everything has been kept strictly secret. Yan and his party are currently staying on the fourth floor of the Six Nations Hotel. Foreign reporters sent a letter to the delegation on the afternoon of the 16th, but it was returned undelivered. Insiders in China generally believe that this trip by the delegation is very important and may become an open bridge between the Nationalists and the Communists.

According to Li's remarks to reporters on the 16th, the government is indeed sincere in its desire for peace talks. Whether the Chinese Communists are sincere or not will be clear within a few days. Although the government's failure is manifested in the military, the real failure lies in politics. In the future, it must compete with the Communist Party politically in order to reverse the current precarious situation. He believes that if the government can truly realize the Three Principles of the People, the result of the competition will definitely be the victory of the Three Principles of the People.

After the banquet, Yan had another conversation with Acting President Li to exchange opinions on the current situation. Then, Yan left Nanjing by plane, with few knowing beforehand. It is difficult to ascertain whether he flew back to Taiyuan or went elsewhere. Since arriving in Nanjing, Yan has been in frequent contact with various senior officials. He returned late on the 15th and had a long talk with Xu Yongchang for two hours, only going to bed at 3 a.m. on the 16th. Gui Yongqing and others visited him in the morning of the 16th, and Yan went out to visit various senior officials at 11 a.m.

### Location of the Legislative Yuan Resuming Session Undetermined; Chen Kewen Says It Depends on the Development of the Situation; Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou Advocate Voting to Decide

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, went to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guilin, and other places to exchange opinions with legislators on the date and location of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of session, and flew back to Nanjing from Guilin on an Air Transport Team plane at about 4 p.m. on the 16th. According to Chen's statement to reporters, as a result of exchanging opinions with legislators in Guangzhou, Guilin, and other places, the legislators have made detailed discussions and considerations regarding the date and location of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of session. About 80 legislators remaining in Guangzhou mostly advocate resuming the session in Guangzhou, and the majority of the 41 legislators remaining in Guilin also advocate resuming the session in Guangzhou. These majority of legislators fled Nanjing during the tense and chaotic situation in the capital and generally believe that the situation in the capital is no longer suitable for the Legislative Yuan to convene. However, the future location of the resumption of session will still depend on the situation in the capital and the evolution of the current situation. The Guangzhou side has made appropriate arrangements for the address of the Legislative Yuan and the residences of the legislators and can be used for the Legislative Yuan to convene at any time. As for the means of transportation for the Legislative Yuan's resumption of session in the future, the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan will also find ways to provide it. Whether in Nanjing or Guangzhou, the Secretariat will be responsible. Regarding the date of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of session, Chen said that it must resume before February 28th according to law, and the location will be determined after President Tong of the Yuan returns to Nanjing and synthesizes the opinions of legislators from various regions.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 16th] The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan is currently preparing for the next plenary session of the Yuan to be held in Nanjing. The Administrative Affairs Section of the Secretariat is in the process of renting various guest houses of the Lishi Society as dormitories for legislators. The section is also inspecting old public buses and purchasing gasoline for the needs of legislators traveling back and forth. In fact, the Legislative Yuan will inevitably resume its session in Nanjing, rather than convening in Guangzhou. Seven legislators from Guangdong have arrived here to participate, and it is said that more will come to Nanjing soon. This breaks the previous rumor that the Guangdong legislators unanimously advocated resuming the session in Guangzhou. In addition, some legislators from Hunan have also returned here to attend. According to legislators in Shanghai, the session is scheduled for the 25th of this month.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] It is reported that as a result of Sun Ke's discussion with the legislators remaining in Guangzhou yesterday, it was decided to ask the legislators remaining in Guangzhou to send two representatives to Guangzhou in the short term to invite legislators from Guilin, Taiwan, Sichuan, Henan, and other places to discuss the issue of resuming the session in Guangzhou.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] The legislators remaining in Guangzhou held a meeting at the Guangzhou City Guest House on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss the location of the resumption of session and passed a telegram to President Tong Guanxian of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, advocating a vote to decide. The original telegram read: Tong Guanxian, President of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, and all members in Nanjing: Regarding the location of the third session of the Yuan, reports indicate that the opinions of colleagues in various places are inconsistent, with some advocating resuming the session in Guangzhou, some advocating in Nanjing, and some advocating resuming in Nanjing and then adjourning to consider moving to Guangzhou. For this issue, colleagues in Guangzhou convened a meeting on the 15th and agreed that at the beginning of the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou, colleagues remaining in Nanjing and Shanghai held a symposium and also decided to move south, and Vice President Liu and Deputy Secretary-General Yan came to Guangzhou to prepare for the resumption of session. Currently, the staff have arrived in Guangzhou. In view of the seriousness of the current situation and the need for continued efforts in peace talks, convening in Guangzhou is most appropriate. However, since the opinions of colleagues in various places are divergent, it is necessary to discuss it at length in order to show the spirit of unity of the Yuan. If the discussions fail to reach a consensus, then the members in various places should vote to express the decision of the whole body. If a certain region convenes a meeting abruptly with more than one-fifth of the members, it will inevitably cause disputes, which will not only not help the current difficulties but even delay national affairs. This is our humble opinion, and we ask you to convey it to the colleagues of the Yuan on our behalf. The spirit of unity that you promoted when you visited Guangzhou a decade ago is deeply admired by our colleagues, and we believe that you will be able to communicate with all parties to obtain a unanimous opinion on this issue. We especially hope that you and your colleagues in Nanjing and Shanghai will jointly decide and come south together as soon as possible. We respectfully send this telegram and hope for a reply. The legislators remaining in Guangzhou bow.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] After more than 200 staff members of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan arrived in Guangzhou, they have formally started working and are actively carrying out their work. They have also specially established a service section to receive legislators arriving in Guangzhou. The food and lodging of the legislators have been resolved. The Executive Yuan has specially allocated the dormitories of the Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank, as well as the Phoenix, Guangdong East, and West Hao Hotels as residences for legislators, which can accommodate 300 legislators with families (two rooms per family) and 500 single legislators (one room for two people). Meals have also been contracted with a special chef responsible for them. Legislators from various places have been arriving in Guangzhou one after another in recent days. Yesterday, Hou Tingdu, Peng Chunda, Yu Shilian, and others flew from Nanchang.

### The Capital's Curfew Time Shortened Starting Last Night

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Acting President Li hosted a banquet for the heads of the capital's security agencies at the Fuhougang residence at noon on the 15th. Zhang Yaoming, Shan Yizhi, Chen Pei, Zhang Zhen, Wan Jianfan, Huang Zhenwu, and others attended. During the banquet, Acting President Li personally instructed Commander-in-Chief Zhang and others that, due to the consolidation of the capital's security, the strength of the national army's river defense, and the retreat of the main Communist forces north of the Yangtze River, the curfew time could be moved back one hour, that is, the curfew would start at 12 midnight every night and end at 5 a.m. the next morning. Zhang and others, after receiving the order, began to implement it on the evening of the 16th.

### The South China Civil Defense Headquarters Officially Established in Guangzhou

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] The South China Civil Defense Headquarters was officially established on the 16th, with Director Yu Hanmou of the Pacification Headquarters concurrently serving as the commander, and Chen Duqi, Huang Guoliang, and Wu Lisan serving as deputy commanders. The main tasks of the headquarters are: (1) to strengthen air defense work in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces; (2) to collect intelligence for use by the army, navy, and air force; (3) to increase citizens' knowledge of air defense; and to establish air defense offices in Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan Island, and other regions in the future.

### Silver Dollars Will Be Allowed to Circulate; Gold and Foreign Exchange May Be Freely Traded; Finance Minister Xu Presided Over Important Meetings in Shanghai All Day Yesterday

[Our Report] Finance Minister Xu Kan presided over important meetings at his residence on Yuyuan Road all day yesterday. It is said that responsible persons from national banks and leading figures in the city's financial circles participated. Liu Gongyun, Governor of the Central Bank, also took time to meet with American friends. The contents were kept strictly secret. Officials completely deny the talk of issuing silver dollars, but in order to maintain the unity of the national currency system and prevent the emergence of various local currencies, the financial authorities may allow the legal circulation of silver dollars among the people, with the Central Bank posting the price daily, stipulating the linkage with the gold yuan, and allowing banks to accept deposits and withdrawals. In addition, gold and foreign exchange will also be publicly and freely traded. Due to the failure of the "August 19" currency reform, the authorities no longer dare to engage in currency reform rashly, and the silver dollars in stock may be insufficient to meet the needs of the whole country. Therefore, this method of devaluation may be adopted to maintain the credit of the gold yuan.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] Finance Minister Xu Kan personally took the financial and economic reform plan to Shanghai and has been extensively exchanging views with the financial community in Shanghai in recent days. He will make a final decision after going to Nanjing and is expected to return to Guangzhou around the 18th.

### Exploring American Views on the Situation in China; Gu Weijun Meets with Acheson; Also Discusses the Issue of Aid to China, but No Resolution

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said on the 15th that the Chinese government "does not want a peace that endangers freedom." After holding a brief meeting with Secretary of State Acheson, Gu told reporters that the meeting was intended to "explore the American government's views on the situation in China."

Gu also said that when the vast majority of people are eager to see peace, he made it clear that the peace they want is a peace of freedom and the preservation of national independence, under which their political rights can be protected, and not a peace under any conditions or a peace that endangers freedom.

Gu also frankly stated that he had not "seen any decisive progress in the peace talks between the Nationalists and the Communists."

Ambassador Gu concluded by saying that he and Acheson had discussed the issue of new American military aid to China, but there was "no resolution."

### American Republican Congressmen Demand a Re-examination of China Policy; Communist Victory in China is a Failure for the United States

[US Information Service, Washington, 15th] Fifty-one Republican Congressmen have recently requested that a committee composed mainly of senior military, political, and economic advisors prepare a report on the situation in China. The Congressmen stated that a Communist victory in China would be a permanent and historical failure for the United States and a serious threat to national security. In a letter to President Truman released tonight, the Congressmen recommended the establishment of such a committee and raised seven questions to clarify the US policy toward China. Of the signatories, seven are members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and several others have made many contributions in the past when the House considered foreign relations. Since last year's election campaign, several Republican spokesmen have repeatedly called for the United States to increase aid to the Nationalist government in China. Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee who signed the letter included Locke, Smith, Jackson, Moor, Jude, and Bolton. Other signatories included Hurd, Chairman of the House Special Committee on Foreign Aid of the 80th Congress, Witzworth, Anderson, and Keeffe.

The letter strongly criticized the US policy toward China, stating that the United States had tried to seek a union between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the result was "extremely harmful." The letter pointed out that Czechoslovakia had "dramatically demonstrated" the danger of this policy, with Czechoslovakia being "dragged behind the Iron Curtain" through its coalition government.

The letter further stated: The Chinese Communist Party seems to have reached the verge of victory. The signatories believe that the CCP's victory will not only pose a serious threat to the United States but also mean "the failure of the forces of freedom." The letter then asked the President questions about the current US policy toward China and asked whether there were plans to change the policy toward China. In addition, the letter asked what stance the United States would take if the government planned to support Chinese anti-communists (such as the Kuomintang) when they raise the issue of Communist aggression as a threat to peace at the United Nations. The letter also asked: If the United States has fulfilled its obligations to China under the Cairo and Yalta agreements, what steps will the United States take to guide the Soviet Union to comply with its obligations to China under the treaties concluded after the Yalta Conference? The letter then recommended the establishment of a committee to re-examine the entire situation and report its findings to the President and Congress.

### The Chinese Communist Radio Station in Northern Shaanxi Broadcasts the List of "War Criminals" and Will Increase to More Than 100

[Our Report] San Francisco, 16th Broadcasting: Hopes for peace talks in China among Americans here have gradually diminished. It is reported that the Chinese Communist radio station in northern Shaanxi has recently emphasized that Li Zongren's call for peace is a hypocritical peace offensive and accused the National Army of actively preparing for war. It is generally believed that this propaganda offensive by the Chinese Communists, combined with the frequent mobilization of Communist troops in various places, may become a prelude to military action. In today's broadcast, the Chinese Communist radio station in northern Shaanxi vehemently criticized the Kuomintang for having changed from calling for peace to calling for war. The Chinese Communists cited a special official propaganda instruction from the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department and rebutted it, emphasizing the importance of arresting war criminals and declaring that "the Chinese Communist Party is still soliciting opinions from various democratic parties and people's organizations regarding the list of war criminals." The 43 war criminals announced on December 25th last year are still insufficient and will be increased to one hundred and several tens.

Editorial

### Political Reform Must Be Delivered!

Acting President Li, in his broadcast the night before last, said: strive for peace, reform politics, especially focusing on the reform of politics, and rectify officialdom and military discipline. This is truly what everyone wants to say at this moment!

Since President Chiang issued his New Year's Day message to sincerely seek peace, the hope for peace has been dim and bright, intermittent, but still, there is some hope. However, speaking of politics, the situation in officialdom in the past month and a half has been truly outrageous! The war on the north bank of the Yangtze River has not yet moved to the riverbank, but the high-ranking officials in Nanjing have already been scrambling to move. Not to mention the chaotic order at train stations, wharves, and airports, even the offices of various ministries are in a mess. It is no wonder that a government like this is subject to ridicule from the Communist Party's broadcasts! If a major decision is not made immediately to thoroughly reform, not to mention being unable to fight again, even the attempt to seek peace may be impossible. Grieving over the daily deterioration of national affairs, we have long pointed out that if high-ranking government officials cannot have a profound awakening, wash their hearts and reform, then they can only surrender and be tried. How can they speak extravagantly of peace, let alone fantasize about war? Until the night before last, Acting President Li could not help but speak the honest words that hit the current ills.

Acting President Li said: "Our government must complete two tasks that are urgently demanded by the people of the whole country: the first is to seek peace, and the second is to reform politics. Regarding the latter, it is to rectify officialdom and military discipline, in other words, to start with the reform of the mentality and behavior of military and government personnel throughout the country." Finally, he also said: "Although the two decisions of the government to seek peace and reform politics have different targets, their purpose is the same, which is based on the supreme principle of following the will of the people and relieving the suffering of the people." This statement not only expresses what the people of the whole country have been pressing in their hearts to say but have not been able to fully say, but also is the current goal of the government itself. Whether to seek peace with the CCP or continue to fight, reforming politics to alleviate the suffering of the people is a prerequisite for success. However, the government authorities have been shouting the slogan of "reform" for a long time. No matter how high the tune is sung, the corruption and incompetence of politics remain the same, and there is a feeling that it is getting worse. Therefore, we hope that Acting President Li will not stop at broadcasting, merely talking emptily about political reform, but should change the past style of "new eight-legged essays" that Party members are accustomed to doing, and earnestly take further steps to deliver on what he says. If the people of the country can see that Acting President Li's political reforms are not empty promises, but can truly achieve "disregarding all difficulties, eliminating all obstacles, and striving to achieve the goal," then the government can rebuild its prestige, and then it can talk about other things.

Regarding our country's politics in recent years, there is a consensus at home and abroad that the malady lies in corruption and incompetence. Even the highest Party authorities bearing heavy responsibilities cannot deny it, and they have also repeatedly tried to reform it. However, after reforming and reforming, there is still no sign of a new look. Where is the crux? Obviously, it lies in the disconnection between the government and the people. Those in power in the government have always been looking for people only in a few circles of new and old bureaucrats, always only trying to perfunctorily cope with the situation and seek solutions in a routine manner, without seeing the people, without thinking of the people, and without selecting true talent from the vast number of people! To be honest, most of the civil servants below the middle level can be law-abiding, honest, and self-respecting. Even under the pressure of high prices, they do not have enough food and clothing, but they can still work on an empty stomach. Of course, there are also many who punch the clock and do nothing, wasting the national treasury, but the arduous lives of most civil servants are not only worthy of our sympathy but also very worthy of admiration. They are definitely not the targets of political reform. If there are good people leading this large group of civil servants, they can work hard. As for the so-called corrupt and incompetent officials, only a small part of them are mixed in, doing evil, using the convenience of their positions, engaging in private interests at public expense, and doing everything. As long as this small portion of scum, this small portion of parasitic elements can be cleared away, politics can be expected to be clear immediately.

However, these corrupt officials who engage in private interests and fraud all have backers who they rely on without fear. If the government authorities cannot make a painful decision, break through personal relationships, and do things impartially, these scum in the government will definitely still be impossible to clear away. Not only will they be impossible to clear away, but one person will attain enlightenment, and even his dogs and chickens will ascend to heaven. There will inevitably be more and more of them. Even if you shout loudly for political reform, political corruption and incompetence will remain the same. Therefore, we hope that when Acting President Li reforms politics, first, he must see the targets clearly, and also use the methods of "capturing the bandits capture the king" and "killing one to warn a hundred," and start by severely punishing a few corrupt officials who have powerful backers. Expose the government's "velvet curtain," welcome people to report corruption, and make it impossible for them to mix in the government again. Second, he must have a spirit of impartiality. "If the law is not enforced, it is because those above violate it." "Execute justice on your own wife, and then extend it to the state." These words are all the clear instructions of ancient sages. If Acting President Li wants to eliminate all corrupt elements and can start with his close confidants to create a new political style of iron-faced ruthlessness, that will surely give people a new look at home and abroad. Even the CCP will have to re-evaluate the government with a different eye.

After eight years of resistance war and three years of internal strife, the Chinese people have suffered enough. In addition, they have been exploited and plundered by corrupt officials. Now, they are truly suffering from a life that cannot be lived. Abandoning war and seeking peace is what everyone desires, but judging from the recent situation, peace will not be achieved overnight. During the transition period, we ordinary people can only hope that the government will quickly reform politics to alleviate the suffering of the people. Now that Acting President Li is determined to reform politics, it can be said that he understands the people. We hope that he will be decisive, practice what he preaches, and use facts to make his check for political reform able to be cashed.

### Looking at the New Situation in Central China

—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Fang Canglang

[Our newspaper, Hankou, 12th dispatch] It should be spring, but it is difficult to hear any news of spring in various parts of Central China. If spring symbolizes peace, this season is clearly abnormal. In addition, in the past three or four days, there have been two heavy snowfalls here, which makes people feel like "traveling in winter during spring," realizing that the lovely spring is still lingering at the final moment of war and peace, and people can't help but feel a bit depressed!

Minor Ailments Are Not a Cause for Concern

People with a little military geography knowledge have all sweated for Central China, but today, with the withdrawal from Xuzhou-Bengbu and the flames of war approaching the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, because the National Army's air and sea control may exert due power on the Yangtze River blockade line 300 miles upstream and 500 miles downstream, in coordination with the land army on the front line of the river defense, because the Communist army's strength, tools, and methods of dealing with sky and water attacks in various parts of East and Central China are still insufficient, it shows that in modern three-dimensional warfare, this area has gained extremely large advantages in time and space, turning the ancient geographically advantageous situation for attack into a flexible position suitable for both attack and defense. Today's Central China has its head resting on Sichuan and Chongqing, its feet straddling Anhui and Jiangxi, its left arm controlling Shaanxi and Henan, and its right arm relying on Hunan. Moreover, in the core of the three towns of Wuhan and its surroundings, where its head is located in Shashi and Yichang, its feet are located in Anqing and Jiujiang, and its left and right arms control the Ping-Han and Yue-Han lines, it has preserved 600,000 troops sufficient to cope with any attacks from southern Henan, eastern Hubei, central Hubei, northern Hubei, or northern Anhui. Ten days ago, the turnaround in southern Henan, as well as the authorities' recent calm stabilization of the battle situation in Shashi and Yichang on the north bank of the Yangtze River, can prove that if the Communist army cannot concentrate 300,000 troops in the plains of Jiang (north bank of the Yangtze River), Han (both banks of the Han River), He (both banks of the Xiang River) and southern Henan, as well as Dabie, Dahong, Tongbai, and the Three Mountains, it cannot expect to succeed in any of the above areas. So I say: The few annoying minor ailments in Central China now are not a cause for concern.

Military and Civilians in Various Places Are Raising Their Vigilance

Although the situation in Central China is changing day by day, human factors are also worth discussing. Bai Jiansheng, a general of the Central China military authorities, this brilliant military expert with a wealth of intelligence, is also very meticulous in his thinking. Since he arrived in Central China, he has indeed done several things. As large as the land problem of limiting land and granting land, as small as the atmosphere of Hankou Wharf, he can order the relevant departments to supervise and improve with a far-sighted vision. The recent Hankou decision to subsidize soldiers and police with one silver yuan for non-staple food expenses starting in February is particularly timely because in the past, each soldier's non-staple food expenses were only 1.5 yuan in Gold Yuan currency per day, which was not enough to buy even two ounces of cabbage, which was really miserable. The recent execution in Hankou of a rice robber and a financial disturber who sold silver yuan has had the expected effect of stabilizing the value of Central China's currency and is also very popular. This is an excellent remedy for seeking stability in progress. Now the military and civilians in various parts of Central China seem to have raised their vigilance regarding the future development of the situation, especially the officers and soldiers in the military. Each of them had hoped for peace with a sad heart, hoping to disarm and return to their hometown to be a peaceful civilian. Unexpectedly, the other side is so aggressive. Under the pressing situation, they have felt disappointed, and it seems that they have turned fear into hatred, and hatred has given them strength. This is a human instinct. Some gentry in Wuhan said: For the CCP's sake, peace is also the most valuable thing, because during the Long March of 25,000 li by the Communist army in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic, that leg strength was fueled by hatred.

Southern Henan and Central Hubei Are Full of Woe

There are especially many grieving soldiers in the Central China National Army units, and their fighting will is becoming stronger day by day. A grieving army is bound to win, as seen in ancient precepts. Moreover, most of the officers here are so poor that they have no money to wash their clothes. This phenomenon is also clearly different from the situation on the eastern front. To give an example, when Que mountain and Xinyang in Southern Henan were undergoing a major change of defense during the old lunar New Year's Eve, although the soldiers moving south from Que mountain and Xin yang were like a big moving yard, the scene was not too gorgeous. However, in an instant, the large army moving north, such as Zhang Gan's corps, formed a fighting body with officers and soldiers lightly loaded and rushed straight forward. When the people of Southern Henan saw this momentum, they were relieved, and those local Communists from the Northeast, posing as Chen and Liu's forces, finally fled at the first sign of trouble under the guidance of some speculative meeting officials and inferior gentry. As a result, Southern Henan turned from danger to safety, and everyone was busy with rehabilitation. In addition, similar phenomena have recently been discovered near Jingmen and Dangyang in Central Hubei, as well as in Shashi and Yichang. It seems that the National Army still needs to make greater efforts in handling intelligence, because although the minor ailments in Central China are not a major concern, the people in many places in Southern Henan and Central Hubei have been dying in despair during the harassment of the rogue-type local Communists.

### Acheson Dismisses Rumors Circulating in Tokyo About the United States Withdrawing from Japan as Absurd; Australian United Press Claims the Information Was Actually Disclosed by Royall Himself

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 16th (Broadcast): Acheson stated at a press conference that the rumors circulating in Tokyo regarding US policy toward Japan were completely unfounded and that the United States had not considered changing its Far East policy. When reporters pressed Acheson to explain the rumors circulating in Tokyo and the specific policies the United States would adopt, Acheson replied that such matters were very annoying. He stated that reporters were forcing officials to make denials while continuing to discuss the issue. He was unwilling to discuss the matter at that time.

Before the press conference concluded, Acheson asked reporters to specify the rumors to which they were referring. The reporters replied that they were referring to the following three points: (1) The United States would withdraw from Japan in the event of war; (2) Japan was indefensible; (3) The United States had no moral obligation to Japan other than to cover occupation costs. Acheson stated that he would only address the first two points but declined to comment on the third.

[Our Dispatch] New York, 16th (Broadcast): Sydney Dispatch: Today, Australian newspapers published a dispatch from the Australian United Press stating that the remarks made by a certain American dignitary in Tokyo, reported by American journalists stationed there, regarding the potential withdrawal of US troops from Japan in the event of a US-Soviet war, were actually made by US Secretary of the Army Royall. Royall held a secret press conference at the US Embassy in Japan. The bureau chiefs of the Associated Press, United Press, International News Service, and reporters from the New York Times, Chicago Daily News, and Christian Science Monitor were all present. Royall stated in the most candid terms that if this decision were known to Australia or the Philippines, "they would be screaming." He instructed reporters not to disclose that the information came from him. The director of the Allied General Headquarters' press department was not invited to the press conference, which was considered unusual by the reporters. Royall also revealed that the withdrawal of US troops from Japan was under consideration by the military.

### Austrian Peace Treaty Negotiations at a Stalemate

Four Powers Hold Behind-the-Scenes Meetings

[Associated Press, London, 16th] Representatives of the four powers hastily held several behind-the-scenes meetings on the 16th in an attempt to break the deadlock between the East and West regarding the Austrian peace treaty. The representatives refused to disclose the details of the meetings, stating only that these meetings were more crucial than the formal exchanges of views in the four-power meetings. US Representative Reber consulted with Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber last night and planned to hold a second meeting with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Bebler within the next 36 hours. Yugoslavia's demands on Austria are the main obstacle in the Austrian peace treaty conference. Reber declined to comment on the possibility of mediating the differences between Yugoslavia and Austria.

### Nine Countries to Participate in European Parliament

Headquarters to be Located in Strasbourg

[Associated Press, London, 16th] Nine countries agreed on the 16th to participate in the proposed European Parliament, with its "capital" located in Strasbourg, France, near the German border. A spokesman for the Danish Foreign Ministry declared in Copenhagen that Denmark was prepared to accept the invitation and join the parliament.

### British Defense Budget

Totaling £759.86 Million; Radar Network to be Built in Western Europe

[Associated Press, London, 16th] The plan for a joint radar defense wall in Western Europe is included in the British defense budget of £759.86 million for 1949-1950. A British government white paper revealed on the 16th that Marshal Montgomery, Chief of Staff of Western European Union Defense, had drafted a specific plan for an air raid warning network for Western European Union members. No further details were released. Although British defense spending increased by £107.5 million, the number of men and women in the army, navy, and air force will be reduced by 43,000 this year. The plan advocates for a total military force of 750,000 personnel.

### Churchill Calls for Military Recruitment to Strengthen the Army's Strength

[Associated Press, London, 15th] Churchill called for military recruitment on the 15th to strengthen the British Army's strength "in these dangerous times."

### North Atlantic Security Treaty Negotiations Reach Critical Stage; US Unwillingness to Assume Military Obligations is the Biggest Obstacle

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Diplomatic and congressional figures recently pointed out that negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty have entered the most critical stage. These well-informed sources suggested that negotiations, originally scheduled to be completed by the beginning of next month, may be delayed due to disagreements over the extent to which the United States should be obligated to assist Western European countries in resisting aggression.

Some congressmen expressed concern that the wording of the current draft could be interpreted too broadly. However, some European diplomats claimed that the current draft was insufficient in guaranteeing that participating countries would resist armed aggression.

Secretary of State Acheson was asked at a press conference about Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally's assertion that the United States should not be bound when deciding whether to aid any attacked European country. Diplomats fear that any further weakening of the North Atlantic Treaty could make it unacceptable to some European countries. If Connally's suggestion is adopted, the treaty would be weaker than the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1947. In the Rio Treaty, participating countries recognized an attack on any one country as an attack on all and stipulated that each country has the obligation to "assist in meeting the attack," with actions short of the use of force executable upon a two-thirds vote of the participating countries.

### Connally Issues Second Statement

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally's statement yesterday opposing the North Atlantic Treaty's imposition of an automatic obligation on the United States to enter the war has caused an uproar in foreign countries. Connally issued a second statement today stating that while the treaty need not stipulate that the United States must automatically send troops to assist if a signatory country in Europe is attacked, the United States can guarantee to "take certain necessary measures to maintain the security of the North Atlantic area," so as not to conflict with the US Constitution and reassure European countries. The Senate is scheduled to discuss the matter next Monday.

Before leaving Britain, Lange stated, "I can confidently say that Britain and Norway now understand each other quite well."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] According to informed sources, the Norwegian government, after the Foreign Minister's return, will likely respond to the Soviet Union's proposal by the end of this weekend, rejecting the conclusion of a non-aggression pact.

### US Art Association Announces World's Top Ten Beauties

Madame Chiang's nose is in perfect harmony with the rest of her face, hence her selection.

### Security Council Discusses South Korea's Membership Application; Soviet Representative Strongly Opposes; Final Resolution Refers it Back to the Membership Committee for Re-Examination

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations Security Council, amidst strong Soviet opposition on the 15th, referred South Korea's application for membership to the Membership Committee for review. Soviet Representative Malik opposed considering South Korea's application, accusing the South Korean government of being "merely a local branch of the US occupation authorities" and claiming that the application for membership "amounts to an insult to the Korean people." The Security Council voted nine to two to overrule Malik's objection and referred the application to the Membership Committee, composed of representatives from the eleven Security Council members. Given Malik's open attacks on the US-backed South Korean government, the Soviet Union will likely use its thirtieth veto when the Membership Committee makes its recommendation in the future. US Representative Austin opposed the application for membership from the Soviet-backed North Korean government.

### Railway Workers' Strike Expands; Six Thousand Workers Petition; Military Police Blockade Zhenru; Worker Representatives Arrive in Shanghai for Negotiations, But No Results Yet

[Our Dispatch] The railway workers' strike in the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) region suddenly expanded yesterday, causing trains on both the Jinghu and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines to be suspended throughout the day. Approximately six thousand workers from the Qichang Locomotive Factory, Changzhou Carriage Repair Shop, and stations in Wuxi, Suzhou, and other locations took special trains to Shanghai to petition. Upon hearing the news, the city's public security authorities dispatched a large number of military police to intercept them along the railway and temporarily detonated a small section of the tracks. The workers' petition train was ultimately blocked near Yangjiaqiao in Zhenru (3.5 kilometers from Zhenru Station). After much persuasion, the workers sent over forty representatives from various units to Shanghai to negotiate with the railway bureau on the issue of compensation. The petition train returned to Nanxiang Station. As of 11:00 PM, there were still no results from the negotiations. It is unlikely that trains on both lines will return to normal today.

The local workers from the two railway bureaus had previously gone on strike to petition on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (14th) due to dissatisfaction with the new compensation announced by the railway bureau. After Director Wang promised that the compensation for employees would be handled the same way as the telecommunications bureau and immediately issued 5,000 yuan per person, the workers resumed work that evening. However, while petitioning, the local workers in Shanghai had notified the Qichang factory workers by telephone. Upon receiving the news, the Qichang factory responded by dispatching a special train at 5:00 PM on that day (15th) to join the petition in Shanghai. Upon receiving the news, the railway bureau ordered station masters along the route to dissuade the train from proceeding and dispatched Deputy Director and Chief of the Mechanical Department Chen Fuhai to persuade them. Chen arrived at Wuxi Station yesterday morning, and the petition train had already arrived in Wuxi. The crowd of workers immediately surrounded Chen and made three demands: (1) Immediately issue evacuation expenses of two shi (a unit of dry measure) of rice per person, (2) Supplement the double salary for January as newly announced by the Executive Yuan, (3) The minimum salary should be two shi of rice for workers, four shi for foremen, and three and a half shi for technicians. Although Chen explained that the workers in Shanghai had already resumed work, and Director Wang had agreed to handle compensation in the same way as the telecommunications bureau and immediately issue 5,000 yuan, it was to no avail. The crowd still insisted on coming to Shanghai.

### Hijacking Station Masters Along the Route to Serve as "Human Hostage Passes"

At approximately 1:00 PM, the crowd hijacked Deputy Director Chen and Wuxi Station Master Zhang Mutao onto the train to serve as passes. (According to regulations, trains cannot proceed without a pass issued by the station master). Other station masters, such as Lin Xiaojin from Changzhou Station and He Zhihua from Nanxiang Station, were also invited onto the train to serve as "human hostage passes." Upon receiving the report, Tang Enbo, Commander of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, was furious. He believed that if workers had demands for improved compensation, they could send representatives to negotiate with the railway bureau. He considered gathering a crowd to petition a violation of martial law and ordered the military police along the route to prevent the train from coming to Shanghai. The traffic police stationed in Changzhou, Shitouwan, Wuxi, Suzhou, Waikuatang, Kunshan, and other locations were unable to prevent the train from proceeding, even after firing warning shots.

Troops Mobilized; Deploying Defense Along the Route

The situation became increasingly tense as the train passed through Suzhou. The city's public security authorities mobilized a large number of military police to protect the North Railway Station and the Railway Bureau. Temporary martial law was declared in the Qiujiang Road area. At the same time, officers and soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the 52nd Army, carrying all combat equipment, were dispatched to the vicinity of Yangjiaqiao, west of Zhenru, to deploy defense along the railway. Commander Tang also sent Chief of Staff Cao Ruzhen to be stationed at the Railway Bureau to be responsible for handling security issues caused by the labor unrest. He Longqing, Director of the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Huang Zhiyuan, Director of the Unified Investigation Office, Qian Hegao, Director of the Police Department of the Railway Bureau, Zhang Yunhe, Commissioner of the Employee Welfare Association of the Railway Bureau, Li Dasan, Chairman of the Special Branch of the Two Lines, Gao Qifu and Yuan Qiaofu, Directors of the Labor Union, and other military police personnel, along with a large number of railway police, mobile units, and guard battalions, rushed to Zhenru at 3:30 PM.

Detonating Railway Tracks to Stop the Train

Reporters and others accompanied them. After passing Zhenru Station and traveling about one kilometer westward, billowing white smoke could be seen in the distance at the end of the railway. The petition train could already be seen. Director He Longqing, considering the urgency of the situation, did not have time to find track workers to remove the rails, so he ordered two grenades to be used to detonate a small section of the tracks. Soldiers from the 52nd Army dispersed and lay prone in the trenches, preparing to fire live ammunition if the workers disobeyed orders. Five armored vehicles from the Special Operations Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters, led by Deputy Battalion Commander Huang Rongwu, also arrived at this time. The train driver, seeing the red flags and the military's defensive posture, had no choice but to stop the train and await orders. Deputy Regiment Commander Li of the 52nd Army immediately sent troops to the locomotive to monitor it and rescued Deputy Director Chen, who had been placed on the front of the train as a "bulletproof shield" by the workers.

Accepting Persuasion and Returning to Nanxiang

He Longqing, Qian Hegao, Chairman Li, and the Labor Union Directors gathered the worker representatives next to the train to give a speech, persuading them to prioritize social order and transportation. They asked all the workers to temporarily return to Nanxiang and have the representatives from each unit come to Shanghai to negotiate compensation with the railway bureau directors. After repeated persuasion, at 7:15 PM, the workers agreed to have a locomotive push the attached twenty-eight covered freight cars back to Nanxiang. Another locomotive came to Shanghai to refuel (the workers' train had a rescue vehicle attached, which was used to repair the detonated tracks). After hearing the news of the arrival of the workers from the Changzhou Qichang factory in Shanghai, the workers in Shanghai also urgently gathered over one thousand four hundred workers and took a special train to welcome them. The train was surrounded by the military at Zhenru Station. After hearing that the workers coming to Shanghai had returned, they also returned to Shanghai. Upon learning that the workers who had come to Shanghai to petition had not eaten for a day and a night, the General Affairs Office of the Railway Bureau temporarily collected 300,000 yuan and purchased fried dough sticks, large flatbreads, steamed buns, biscuits, and other food items to send to Nanxiang to distribute to the petitioning employees to fill their stomachs. The railway bureau hosted a dinner for the forty-odd worker representatives. A large number of troops and armored vehicles remained stationed around the station and the Railway Bureau, and had not been withdrawn as of late night.

### Garrison Commander's Remarks Analyzing the Types and Causes of Labor Unrest

[Our Dispatch] Chen Daqing, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, commented on the recent frequent labor unrest in the city at his monthly press briefing yesterday, stating that labor unrest can be divided into four types: work slowdowns, strikes, gathering crowds to coerce, and riots and destruction. The causes are either economic, politically motivated disruptions, or factional struggles. Regarding work slowdowns and strikes, he believes that the labor union should cooperate with the Social Affairs Bureau to eliminate them before they occur or to properly resolve them after they occur. As for those who gather crowds to coerce and engage in riots and destruction, the Garrison Headquarters will severely crack down on them, and the leaders will be arrested and summarily executed on the spot. Those who are found to be masterminding politically motivated labor unrest behind the scenes will also be severely punished.

### Extortion Letters, Murder of Accomplice, Repeated Robberies – A Gang of Master Thieves Arrested One After Another

[Report from our newspaper] On the 6th of this month, the Xin Cheng Police Precinct received a tip-off that a gang of bandits was hiding in the Chedaijiao area of Huai'an Road, planning to carry out a robbery that evening. Section Chief Hao Jingyi instructed officers Liu Zhufeng, Dai Wende, Gong Shimin, Gao Changbiao, Gu Zhongyi, Wang Jizeng, and others to disguise themselves and go to the address. As expected, they captured bandits Zhang Agou and Cao Jiacheng in front of the No. 640 gate of the Fourth Textile Factory on that road. Two pistols were found on Zhang. After strict interrogation, they confessed that they were waiting for their accomplices to carry out a robbery. The officers then used a trick, ordering them to wait nearby. However, no accomplices appeared that night, so the two criminals were taken to the precinct for interrogation.

According to Zhang Agou's confession, the two pistols were given to him by his friend Chen Defa. He also revealed that Chen lived in Panjiawan, Zhabei. Detectives Jiao Guorui, Lu Yuheng, Wang Defu, Wang Wenxiang, and others were dispatched to escort the criminal to the address, and Chen was captured. He confessed that he had an accomplice named Zhu Jinquan, who lived in Kangjiaqiao, Kangding Road. The officers went to the Jiangning District Office to check the household registration, but only found Zhu Jingen, not Zhu Jinquan. Chen was then taken to the Household Registration Section of the General Bureau to identify the photograph on the household registration card, and he confirmed that Zhu Jingen was the same person as his accomplice Zhu Jinquan. Zhu was immediately arrested at No. 31, east of Jinsitu Temple, Kangding Road. Based on their confessions, bandit Huang Xianyi was captured at No. 826, Tokyo Road. The remaining fugitives are still at large. Combining the confessions of the various defendants, it was learned that they had committed nine crimes, including several robberies, the murder of their accomplice Ni Jianfu, and sending extortion letters to Mei Shaotang. The investigation of all the criminals has been completed and they will be handed over to the court for trial.

### Representatives of Families of Victims of the Taiping Steamer Disaster Call for Salvage of Bodies and Distribution of Compensation

[Report from our newspaper] Representatives of the Taiping Steamer Disaster Relief Committee, Liu Zirun, Li Shuwen, Qi Jieshen, and others stated that more than half a month has passed since the Taiping Steamer disaster, but the China Union Company has consistently failed to actively carry out any relief efforts. Furthermore, the company has also stopped providing food and lodging for the rescued survivors since yesterday afternoon. Therefore, they specially invited reporters to the Youth Association yesterday to provide a detailed report of the circumstances before and after the accident. They reiterated that the China Union Company should be fully responsible for the tragedy and appealed for several points: (1) Demand that the China Union Company promptly begin salvage operations. Even if it is believed that the time has passed for the bodies to be identifiable, they should be transported and buried in a common cemetery as a memorial and to alert the shipping industry. (2) Promptly allocate compensation of 100 shi of white rice per deceased passenger. (3) Retain the right to demand compensation for all losses in accordance with the law. (4) The China Union Company should currently provide each survivor with a temporary loan of 100,000 yuan for living expenses, which will be deducted from the loss compensation in the future. (5) Request the government to pay attention to the responsibility for this incident and to thoroughly investigate the corruption in maritime administration. The thousands of lives lost in the Jiangya and Taiping disasters should at least be exchanged for the authorities' determination to quickly reform maritime administration.

### City Buses Completely Cease Operations Yesterday – Mayor Orders Resumption of Service Today – Five Out of Six Demands Agreed To

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, employees of all bus routes of the Municipal Public Transportation Company went on strike because the company refused their request for each person to be given 6 shi of white rice as emergency expenses. Initially, employees at Fenglin Bridge learned that the company authorities had rejected their request and collectively did not dispatch any buses after breakfast. At the Fair Road maintenance yard, some buses initially departed, but they soon returned to the yard after learning the news, leading to a complete cessation of operations that continued into the evening without resumption. Mayor Wu was furious upon hearing the news and issued a handwritten order yesterday afternoon, demanding that all employees immediately resume work starting today. Those who failed to resume work would be dismissed. Wu also notified the Garrison Department and the Police Bureau to dispatch personnel to protect the company's two maintenance yards at Fenglin Bridge and Fair Road. However, the company's employees do not have a labor union organization, so there was no formal contact between the two sides after the strike began yesterday. According to the company, the workers' demands were: (1) Improve the salary payment method. (2) Improve the rotating rest system. (3) Request educational loans for children. (4) The same welfare benefits as the employees of the British and French tram companies. (5) The same food allowance as the employees of the British and French tram companies. (6) Issue 6 shi of rice as emergency expenses. It is now reported that the company has agreed to all except the sixth point.

### French Tram and Bus Services All Cease Operations at One Point

Workers of Five Public Utilities Fight for Allowances

[Report from our newspaper] Workers of the five major public utility companies in this city – the French-owned Water and Electricity, the American-owned Electricity, the British-owned Tram, Gas, and Waterworks – have been demanding additional welfare allowances for employee transportation and meals, but the matter has been delayed and unresolved. Yesterday morning, Shen Ding, the director of the Labor Department of the Bureau of Social Affairs, convened representatives of labor and management of the respective public utility companies for mediation. While discussions were still underway at noon, employees of the French Tram and Bus services misunderstood the delayed return of their representatives to report on the negotiations. At around 11:00 AM, trams and buses on various routes gradually returned to the depot or stopped operating after reaching their destinations. By afternoon, all transportation on the lines had completely ceased. After the Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor, Lu Jingshi, convened a joint mediation session, an agreement was reached in the evening, and operations resumed after 6:30 PM. However, because most of the employees had already returned home, very few vehicles were running. It is expected that operations will return to normal today.

### Agreements Reached with Three Companies, Negotiations Continue with Others

Telephone company employees previously had poorer welfare benefits than other public utility companies. After negotiations, the company increased welfare allowances, with workers earning a base salary of 26 yuan receiving an allowance of 7 jiao 5 fen per day, and those with higher wages receiving progressively smaller allowances. After negotiations, the electricity company agreed to a maximum welfare allowance of 4 jiao 5 fen. After yesterday's mediation, the French Water and Electricity company also decided that those with a base salary of 30 yuan would receive a daily allowance of 7 jiao 1 fen, with the allowance decreasing by 1 fen for each additional yuan of base salary, up to a maximum of 1 yuan.

Welfare allowances for employees of the British-owned Gas, Waterworks, Tram, and other companies are also being studied and negotiated separately, and solutions are expected to be reached soon.

### Fire and Explosion at Jiangwan Armory – Extinguished the Same Evening; Fortunately No Casualties Among Officers and Soldiers – Deputy Depot Chief Detained for Investigation into Cause

[Report from our newspaper] The second depot of the Fifth Armory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters on Guohua Road, Jiangwan, suddenly caught fire and exploded at 5:00 PM yesterday. The Fire Department and others rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was quickly extinguished. However, the ammunition stored inside continued to explode sporadically late into the night. Details of casualties and losses were not yet available last night. The depot was originally a Japanese military barracks, built with wooden boards and lead sheets, and consisted of nine warehouses storing old and discarded ammunition seized from the Japanese army. In addition, there were several dormitories and offices. According to the depot chief, Duan Youkai, the fire started in the latrine next to the office, which housed a company of maintenance troops repairing artillery shells. After the fire broke out, it spread to the military supplies warehouse and nearby civilian residences and shacks. The general depot chief, Li Ruojun, immediately led personnel to rescue the situation, while simultaneously sending urgent telegrams to the Fire Department, Police Bureau, Garrison Department, and others. By the time the fire trucks arrived to put out the fire, it had already spread to the ammunition storage area and caused explosions. Fortunately, seven of the nine warehouses were a considerable distance from the fire source, so the losses were not significant after strenuous rescue efforts. One military supplies warehouse, one office, one kitchen, and over ten nearby civilian residences and shacks were destroyed. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, and the depot chief, Duan Youkai, has been detained by Chen Qian, the director of the Shanghai Supply Bureau, who is in charge of the armory. General Depot Chief Li Ruojun has been tasked with handling the aftermath. There are also 15 officers and 50 soldiers in the depot. The bureau was still investigating late at night whether there were any missing or injured personnel.

[Additional report] Director Chen of the Fire Department stated late last night that it has been confirmed that there were no casualties among the officers and soldiers at the armory. (Attached image shows firefighters holding torches and shining lights to spray water to extinguish the fire. Photographed by our newspaper.)

### Morning Friends Win the Cup – Hui Li Suffers Crushing Defeat by Three Points – Morning Friends Win the Championship in Thrilling Battle

[Report from our newspaper] The final match of the Morning Friends Cup Basketball Championship, Morning Friends versus Hui Li, took place at the Municipal Gymnasium last night at 7:00 PM. Over a thousand spectators were present, creating a passionate and tense atmosphere. In the end, Morning Friends defeated Hui Li 45-42 in a hard-fought battle, winning the championship. Hui Li trailed by seven points at halftime, 23-16. Morning Friends used a strategy of using softness to overcome strength, with Wang Bowen putting on the most outstanding performance. Wang Rongsheng and He Zeng also played well. Hui Li was too eager to win, resulting in excessive tension. Cao Zhiji's prowess was undiminished, and Wang Yongfang and Tian Fuhai also displayed their shooting skills, but the overall performance was not as good as in the second game, leading to a crushing defeat by three points. In the friendly match, Jian Le faced the Kang team. The Kang team led by two points at halftime, 24-22, with a tight game situation. In the end, Jian Le reversed the defeat and won 42-38.

Close Contact on the Court – Difficult to Determine the Winner

The life-or-death battle of the Morning Friends Cup Group A Championship between the Morning Friends and Hui Li teams began at 7:05 PM. After contact, Wang Yongfang and Fu Qixia scored in succession, and Tian Fu added a free throw, putting Hui Li ahead 3-2. Morning Friends called a timeout. Lao Cao also made a free throw, and Ren Yu and Wang Bowen scored on free throws, tying the score at 5-5. Yun Quan and He Zeng added three points, putting Morning Friends ahead 8-5. Wei Xu and Bowen each scored for their respective teams, making it 11-7. Hui Li then reconsidered its strategy. Hui Li missed several free throws. Yongfang then tried a long shot and scored, closing the gap to 11-9. Cao Zhiji scored with a turnaround shot, tying the score at 11-11. Liang Xiong exchanged in for Shi Yunquan, causing the score to fluctuate. Bowen fought hard, giving Morning Friends a 20-13 advantage again. At halftime, Morning Friends led by seven points, 23-16.

Mixed Battle – Morning Friends Take the Lead

Prizes were awarded during the halftime break, presented by Mrs. Kang Jiwen. The championship team beamed with joy. The game restarted, becoming even more intense. Zhiji, Qixia, He Zeng, and Fuhai each displayed their prowess, bringing the score to 27-20. Morning Friends called a timeout. From then on, both sides showed their shooting skills, with the score increasing rapidly. With ten minutes remaining, the score was 33-27. Soon after, Zhang Pu replaced Wei Xu for Hui Li. Both sides fought in a mixed battle, making it difficult to make progress. Morning Friends still took the lead, but Hui Li also had poor ball luck, with the ball often circling around the basket. When Zhiji and Baokang scored, the score gradually closed to 38-34, still two points behind. Hui Li committed more fouls, giving the opponent opportunities to score free throws, which affected their morale and was a miscalculation. The score then separated again, 43-36. Morning Friends called its fifth timeout. Wei Xu scored from a distance, and Baokang committed a foul, replaced by Shang Chongyue. Zhiji also scored, but Morning Friends still won the championship 45-42.

### Gold Bond Prices Rise Again – Formal Listing and Trading Must Wait Until Early Next Month

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the quoted price for gold bonds was 66,250 yuan, an increase of 3,850 yuan compared to the previous day. Few retail sales were made, but securities exchange brokers collectively subscribed for a quantity that could reach 100 million yuan. As for the listing date for gold public bonds, external rumors vary. It has been learned from the National Bank that although the Securities Exchange Market is scheduled to reopen on February 21, the formal listing of gold public bonds will likely not become a reality until next month. This is because the Securities Exchange has been closed for a long time, and once it reopens, there will be many complex issues that will take time to resolve. Moreover, the current issuers of gold public bonds are reservation vouchers rather than formal bonds, which will cause difficulties when exchanging them in the future. Therefore, the listing and trading of gold public bonds will still take time.

### Tight Credit Situation Eases – Cash Remains Scarce

Yesterday, the city's credit situation eased as remittances from other ports arrived and wages were paid by industrial and commercial enterprises, providing a large supply of floating capital. However, due to turnover issues, the lending groups outside the industry still displayed a tendency to restrict lending. The city's interbank overnight lending rate was between 70 and 90 yuan per 1,000 yuan, generally around 80 yuan. Before noon, funds flowed out of the industry, and the overnight lending rate fell to 70 yuan. Cash remained scarce yesterday, and cashier's checks were widely used, with a discount rate higher than 4%. Industry firms limited the maximum withdrawal to 10,000 yuan.

In order to tighten market credit, the Central Bank restricted cash withdrawals for exchange balances for all firms starting from the 16th to 30%.
