A certain unit of the defending army took the initiative and bravely counterattacked, inflicting a severe blow. The battle was extremely fierce. In addition to the two Communist guard regiments in the Yuepu area, which were completely annihilated by our forces, more than 3,000 Communists were killed or wounded in the Yanghang area.

### Air Force Continuously Engaged Day and Night; Over 200 Sorties Flown; Significant Results, Nearly 10,000 Communists Killed

[Central News Agency, this city] Air Force Headquarters reports: Today is the second day of the defense of Shanghai's outskirts. The army, navy, and air force are jointly defending Shanghai with all their might. The air force has been launching sorties around the clock, with over 200 sorties flown in total. The fiercest fighting is still occurring in the Yuepu and Yanghang area northwest of Wusong. Both towns are firmly defended by Nationalist troops to protect the vital Wusong fortress area, which serves as the gateway to and from the great city of Shanghai. From midnight to dawn on the 14th, the Communists launched three offensives in Yuepu and Yanghang, but all were repelled by Nationalist troops. The land artillery and naval warships anchored in the Wusong harbor provided continuous artillery support throughout the night to suppress the Communist offensive, bombarding the attacking Communist forces. The air force also dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle from the air at night. From 5 AM onwards, our aircraft constantly flew over the outskirts of Yuepu and Yanghang, bombing and strafing the Communist forces hiding in the villages and towns of Taicang, Jiading, Gujiazai, Shenxiangzhai, Chuanxinzhai, Shengjiaqiao, and Xinzhen, killing nearly 10,000, destroying 80 trucks, 7 artillery positions, over 100 horses, over 100 wooden boats, 3 bunkers, and over 10 frontline fortifications.

In addition to concentrating its main force to bomb and strafe the Communist forces north of Shizilin, Yuepu, and Yanghang, achieving the above results, the air force also dispatched over 100 aircraft to patrol and bomb extensively in the outer areas of greater Shanghai, achieving the following main results:

(1) Near Weiting Station on the Suzhou-Kunshan highway, Mustang fighter planes discovered a convoy of over 20 Communist ammunition trucks. After strafing, the convoy exploded on the spot, leaving only 6 trucks. The highway surface was riddled with bomb craters. The low-flying Mustang was almost brought down by the blast.

(2) The air force discovered 30,000 Communist troops marching east from Jiaxing towards Jiashan, Songjiang, and from Songjiang towards Shanghai, killing over 3,000.

(3) Today, 12 large wooden boats carrying 1,500 Communist troops landed at Jinshan Hengquan Pavilion. 500 were killed by bombing.

(4) Over 1,000 Communist troops, along with over 20 mules, horses, and trucks, were marching along the highway from Jiaxing towards Pinghu and from Pinghu towards Jinshanwei. Over 300 were killed by strafing.

(5) Three Communist black command sedans were destroyed by bombing on the Changshu highway.

Further news: Starting at 7 PM on the 14th, the Communists began their continuous three-night night offensive against Shanghai. The focus of the defense of greater Shanghai remains on the outskirts of Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang. The army and navy are using artillery to counter the attacking Communist forces and using positions to prevent the Communist forces from breaking into this area. The air force has also dispatched a large number of aircraft to control the airspace at night. The night battles on the outskirts of Yuepu and Yanghang are even fiercer than last night.

### Military Observers Claim Nationalists Are Deploying Countless Pocket Defenses in Shanghai; Will Rival Verdun and Stalingrad

[Central News Agency, this city] A military observer recently stated: The Nationalist army has deployed countless pocket defenses near Shanghai. Each pocket defense is surrounded by sufficient mobile forces, including infantry, artillery, tanks, and logistical support troops, and there is a detailed plan to counter the Communists' amoeba-like attacks. The current infiltration tactics can exert great effectiveness. Judging by the results of the 13th, the Communist army suffered 6,000 to 7,000 casualties in a single day. This was only a small pocket defense battle. If the entire battle unfolds and five pocket defense battles are fought each day, the Communist army may lose 30,000 men per day. Chen Yi's total strength is only 20 columns. Shanghai may become a Verdun of World War I or a Stalingrad of World War II. However, it is worth pondering what Chen Yi's strategic decisions will be for the Shanghai-Wusong battle in the future: a hard attack or an encirclement.

### Wartime Far East British Commander Talks About the Defense of Hong Kong: Assistance Needed from the United States, the British Commonwealth, and Federal Nations

[United Press London, 13th] The wartime commander of British forces in the Far East declared on the 13th that the effective defense of Hong Kong requires assistance from the United States, the British Commonwealth, and federal nations. Without sufficient naval and air forces to control bases within a short distance in cooperation, no matter how strong the Hong Kong garrison is, it cannot hold the area. Before the war, the British Far East Fleet had abundant strength and the friendship of China. It was estimated that the British army could independently defend Hong Kong for only 90 days. Now, the estimated number of days that can be sustained must be reduced unless the British garrison can reliably obtain naval and air force bases for support from the United States and other friendly powers in the Pacific.

According to the former British Far East naval commander, in 1935, the British and American navies had a "gentleman's agreement." At that time, the strength of the British Far East fleet was reduced because a portion was transferred to the Mediterranean to deal with the threat posed by Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia.

The air force commander said that the air force is extremely important to defend Hong Kong, but air force bases require considerable planning. The closest air force base that would not fall into the hands of the Chinese Communists is in the Philippine Islands. Once Hong Kong encounters a full-scale attack, the intention of the British to defend the area can only be implemented through a planned regional defense approach. This regional defense approach must include American territories and is essentially equivalent to a Pacific defense treaty.

### British Spitfire Squadron Flies to Hong Kong

However, the pilot was not injured and traveled to Hong Kong on the accompanying Dakota aircraft.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th] The British destroyer Black Swan will arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 16th. The ship went to the Yangtze River earlier this month to assist the British warship Amethyst and was involved in artillery battles with the Communist army en route.

### Australian Prime Minister Chifley Says No Consideration Given to Sending Troops to Hong Kong

[United Press Canberra, 13th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley stated at a press conference today that the Australian government has not considered sending Australian troops to Hong Kong, nor has it received a request for assistance.

### Philippine House of Representatives Changes Location of Embassy in China

Changing Nanjing to China to Facilitate Relocation

[United Press Manila, 13th] In view of the unstable situation in China, the Philippine House of Representatives last night amended a clause in the budget that specified Nanjing as the location of the Philippine diplomatic mission in China, changing "Nanjing" to "China" so that the diplomatic mission could move from one location to another within China if necessary.

The House of Representatives also voted to abolish the position of consul in Hong Kong. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the position of consul in Hong Kong was abolished because the person appointed to the position was not accepted by some members of Congress.

### U.S. China Policy Inevitably to be Thoroughly Revised

Remarks by Senator Wiley

[United Press Washington, 13th] Leading Republican Senator Wiley asserted today that the Truman administration's China policy is bound to be thoroughly revised. Wiley predicted that the Senate would intensify pressure on the government to restore diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain and would seek to discuss the Spanish issue ahead of schedule. Wiley expressed his opposition, saying: "The China issue should be discussed first. Those who are urging recognition of the Spanish government today are the same people who initially supported the organization of a coalition government in China." It is reported that Democratic Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally and influential Republican Senator Vandenberg have both supported restoring relations with Spain.

### Sunday Forum: The Problem of Prisoners of War in International Wars

— Ji Heqin

In recent years, wars have been continuous. The bloodstains of World War II have not yet dried, and new international wars are brewing. The most shocking atomic weapons are now known to all countries and are no longer surprising. New killing weapons are emerging one after another. Human culture seems to be moving backward. Weapons are changing with each passing day, and strategies are also advancing daily. However, humanitarianism in war has not only not progressed but has regressed to 2,000 years ago. Not to mention anything else, just the issue of prisoners of war can show the situation.

The Book of Documents says: "Exterminate the ringleaders, do not punish the followers." This means that in war, it is only necessary to eliminate the leaders and not to punish their followers. The Zuo Zhuan says: "A gentleman does not inflict a second wound," meaning that if the enemy is already injured and unable to fight, there is no need to harm him again. Sima Rangju said: "If the enemy is injured, provide medicine and return him." This means that if the enemy is injured and captured, his wounds should be treated with medicine and he should be sent back. This shows that the foundation of Chinese history and culture is built on humanitarianism.

Eighty-five years ago, the Swiss invented the Red Cross as a neutral organization. On August 22, 1864, the Geneva Convention was established regarding the treatment of military personnel in the battlefield. A total of 55 countries participated in succession. China joined the organization in 1904, introduced by Japan. Article 5 of the treaty states: "All people in the country who go to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers have the right to freedom and respect. All officers and soldiers of belligerent countries are responsible for notifying the people of their rights to neutral aid and the rescue of wounded soldiers. Any person who houses and cares for wounded soldiers in their home should be protected, and the army must not occupy it. In addition, if war taxes are levied, a portion may be exempted." Article 6 states: "All wounded and sick soldiers, regardless of nationality, should be accepted and treated. To the extent possible, with the agreement of both parties, military officers have the right to immediately return wounded enemy soldiers to the enemy front line during the war. Any wounded soldier who has recovered and is deemed unable to fight may also be sent back to his country. All soldiers and management personnel who are returned shall enjoy absolute neutrality." The Hague Convention, established on July 29, 1899, regarding maritime hospitals and ambulance ships, is also generally the same as land rescue. According to the above regulations, many of today's prisoners of war have not been able to enjoy the benefits of this treaty. This is not only unfortunate for the prisoners of war but also due to the failure of military officers and public and private organizations responsible for rescuing the wounded and sick to fulfill their responsibilities.

On July 6, 1906, the Geneva Convention improved the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers on the battlefield. Article 1 states that all military personnel and officially accompanying personnel, when injured or sick, regardless of nationality, should be treated by the belligerent group responsible for the management of the personnel, and should be respected. If belligerent countries are forced to abandon wounded and sick personnel to the enemy, they should also consider the military situation at the time and leave behind as many medical personnel and medical supplies as possible to facilitate treatment. Article 2 states that if the personnel fall into the hands of the enemy and become prisoners, the humanitarian principles regarding the treatment of prisoners should be adopted. Belligerent countries are free to formulate agreements that meet the following points for wounded or sick prisoners: (1) After each battle, wounded personnel abandoned on the battlefield should be returned to each other. (2) All wounded or sick personnel who, after recovering or when their illness has subsided enough to be transferred, are no longer willing to be prisoners by the belligerent group may be sent back to their country. (3) If the consent of a neutral country is obtained, wounded or sick personnel of the enemy may be sent to the neutral country, which shall be responsible for guarding them until the end of the war. Article 3 states that after each battle, the victorious belligerent group should immediately try to collect and protect wounded or dead soldiers to prevent looting and abuse. The victorious party must be cautious in the burial or pre-cremation examination of the dead.

The Hague Convention of October 18, 1907, made more progress on the preferential treatment of prisoners. For example, Article 4 states: Prisoners of war are under the authority of the enemy government, not under the authority of the person or group that captured them. Prisoners should be treated in accordance with humanitarian principles. With the exception of weapons, horses, and military documents, all other private property belonging to the prisoners remains the property of the prisoners. Article 5: Cities, fortresses, barracks, or other residences may be used to guard prisoners, and prisoners may not leave the designated area. Imprisonment is only permitted when necessary to maintain order. Article 6: With the exception of officers among the prisoners, the state may, according to their rank and skills, employ prisoners to work, but the work must not be excessive and must be limited to matters unrelated to the war. Prisoners may work for public institutions, private individuals, or for themselves. Prisoners who work must be paid wages equal to those of military personnel working in the country. If there is no provision for military wages, the work should be estimated and given a reasonable price. If working for other public institutions or private individuals, the conditions for the price of the work must be negotiated with the military authorities. In addition to deducting living expenses, the wages earned by prisoners should be sufficient to improve their situation. If there is a surplus, it should be settled and paid in full upon release.

Twenty years later, on July 27, 1929, countries around the world again concluded a treaty in Geneva to improve the treatment of wounded soldiers, and stated in the introduction: "Each signatory country recognizes that in the midst of intense warfare, it should do its best to reduce the unavoidable suffering of prisoners, improve their treatment, and develop the principles of the Hague Peace Conference, with particular emphasis on the military laws and customs of war attached to the conference." The main points are as follows:

(1) Wounded and sick soldiers should be respected and protected in any environment, treated humanely, and have their rights protected regardless of nationality. If some troops are forced to abandon their wounded and sick soldiers to the enemy, they should, to the extent possible given military needs, retain some medical personnel and their supplies to assist in their care.

(2) In addition to the protection and retention of wounded and sick soldiers listed in the above article, wounded and sick soldiers of a country's army who fall into the power of the enemy's army become prisoners and are entitled to the public provisions stipulated for ordinary criminals, but the army may, when it deems necessary, formulate regulations that are superior to the current laws in order to give preferential treatment to wounded and sick soldiers.

(3) After each battle, the occupier of the war zone should try to search for wounded and dead soldiers to protect them from looting or abuse. In any war environment, the two countries' armies should set a local truce or ceasefire to facilitate the search for wounded soldiers trapped in the two fronts.

(4) Field armies should, within the shortest possible time, notify each other of the names of wounded, sick, and dead soldiers of the other side collected or discovered, and records that can be used as evidence. Field armies should establish sergeants' death lists and send them to each other, with half of the soldiers' badges sent to their home country's army and the other half left on the dead. Field armies should pay attention to conducting careful examinations before burying or cremating the dead, or, if possible, using drugs to test them to explore the truth of death. In addition, attention must be paid to the honor of the deceased's burial, the respect of the tomb, and appropriate symbols to facilitate future identification. In order to fulfill this article, field armies should formally organize tomb construction offices at the beginning of the war so that even if the number of burials is large, corpses can be exhumed at any time, and no errors occur in the deceased's surname. After the end of the war, the two countries' armies should immediately exchange tomb lists and lists of the names of the dead buried in public cemeteries or elsewhere.

(5) Army commanders may solicit local enthusiasts to house and care for wounded and sick soldiers in the army, but they must be subject to the commander's inspection, and the recruits should be given special protection and considerable convenience.

The above is said to apply to international wars, but the tragic civil wars are also applicable. After World War II, several countries experienced civil wars in succession, and the issue of the treatment of prisoners of war was not given due attention. From a humanitarian point of view, both sides of the civil war should abide by international conventions.

### True Picture of Peace in Beiping: Guangzhou Central Daily News Publishes Article by Wu Yanhai

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th] Since the 7th of this month, the Central Daily News has continuously published an article by Wu Yanhai entitled "The True Picture of Peace in Beiping." As an eyewitness, with a calm and objective attitude, the article describes in detail the fall of Beiping, which the Communist Party calls a "peace model." Starting today, the full text will be broadcast in installments as follows:

(1) Foreword

Since Beiping was locked behind the Iron Curtain, northern compatriots who have fled and left behind many relatives and friends are eager to get some news from their hometown. Concerned compatriots across the country, because Beiping is referred to as a peace model by the Communist Party, also want to hear about the situation there. Although there have often been some fragmented reports in newspapers, they are all piecemeal and still difficult to satisfy the desires of the general public. The author flew to Beiping on January 8 to visit his sick father and escaped as a disguised peddler on March 19, bypassing Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan. I recently arrived in Guangzhou after many twists and turns. I spent a lot of time in Beiping during the siege and liberation. Because the leaders of all circles in Hebei, Pingjin were old friends for many years, and many residents there were relatives and old friends, I knew more about the siege, the brewing of peace, the ease of defense, and all kinds of inside information. After arriving in Guangzhou, friends who care about Beiping asked about this one after another. Seeing one person, I would say it once; seeing two people, I would say it twice. Once I opened the conversation, it would take two or three hours. In addition to this long journey, I had to socialize three or four times a day, which was really exhausting. To avoid laziness, I wrote "The True Picture of Peace in Beiping" as a "comprehensive report."

(2) Before the Siege

Since the War of Resistance, Mr. Fu Zuoyi has been stationed in Chahar and Suiyuan, advocating national freedom, political democracy, and economic equality. He also practiced what he preached, wearing plain clothes, eating simple meals, and living in the same way as his soldiers. He was also humble and always held work review meetings, using new methods at any time. Therefore, for more than ten years, he has been invincible. The central government has always relied on him as the Great Wall of the North. At the end of the 36th year, the military was defeated in the Northeast, and Shijiazhuang, Hebei, fell. The General Headquarters re-deployed and established the North China Suppression General Headquarters. From then on, the five provinces and two cities were handed over to him. The land was large and the soldiers were few. At that time, many friends were worried about him, but Mr. Fu had strong confidence and declared that if the Northeast could hold firm for one year, by the end of the 38th year, he could be responsible for ensuring that North China would be safe. After that, he worked diligently, held two military and political discussions, and implemented the control surface for guerrilla suppression. Shi Yousan's cavalry even conducted guerrilla suppression in Hejian, which had been a Communist Party supply station base for more than ten years, and won a great victory. He also organized a Jin-aid corps and raided Shijiazhuang. The strong will of the generals and the vigorous morale of the soldiers were truly unparalleled for a time. Unfortunately, before his preparations were complete, after November last year, Jinzhou withdrew, Changshen changed hands, and the entire Northeast changed color. Mr. Fu had only more than 400,000 troops under his command, which was not enough to deal with Nie Rongzhen's unit. After that, Lin Biao led hundreds of thousands of troops to the south in victory, and the fate of North China can be imagined. It is said that the General Headquarters had the following plans at that time: (1) Withdraw from North China and transfer all forces to northern Jiangsu to participate in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. After this battle was won, they would go north along the Jinpu Railway and seek development. (2) Move the North China Suppression General Headquarters to Tanggu and withdraw the forces in Baoding, Zhangjiakou, and other places. Let Li Wen lead the 13th and 16th armies to garrison Beiping alone. The remaining troops would be concentrated in the coastal areas of Tianjin, Tanggu, and Tangshan. After that, central aid and US aid could come from the sea in a steady stream, and advance and retreat would be easy. It is said that Mr. Fu adopted the second plan at that time. First, the main suppression force was withdrawn from Baoding. Because his own troops were in Zhangjiakou, he went there twice to discuss the withdrawal plan. However, because the local councils and mass organizations tearfully pleaded to stay, and after two days of meetings, they could not bear to make a final decision. In this uncertain time, Lin Biao's Communist army quickly arrived at Nankou via Jiandao and cut off the withdrawal route. He had no choice but to quickly order on December 13 to concentrate the troops from various places in Pingjin, Zhangtang to avoid being eaten piecemeal again. Thus, the siege began on the 14th.

(3) Solitary Army Defending Bitterly

After December 14, the five provinces and two cities under the jurisdiction of the entire North China Suppression General Headquarters Fu, except for Suiyuan, which still maintained half a province, only had six isolated points left: Taiyuan, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Tanggu, and Beiping and Tianjin. Taiyuan and Datong were actually the responsibility of Mr. Yan, so I won't discuss them here. The remaining four isolated points were directly commanded by Mr. Fu. It is said that the initial wishful thinking was: (1) Still order the troops in Zhangjiakou to break through to Ping; (2) After the victory of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the central government could reinforce from Tanggu; (8) The Beiping troops, in addition to leaving the 13th and 16th armies, would take the opportunity to rush to Jingu and recover the coastal area, and still complete the original deployment. Therefore, at the beginning of the siege, Mr. Fu was still not discouraged, and the morale of the troops below was still high. However, a series of facts later negated everything. The first was the complete martyrdom of the 35th Army and the Provisional 3rd Army in Xinbaoan, south of Zhangjiakou. Army Commander Guo Juezhi. Army Commander Chunshan only escaped with his life. This battle was indeed too tragic. It is said that Lin Biao's troops were extremely angry because the two armies had repeatedly refused to surrender, so they used the artillery they had just obtained from the Northeast to continuously bombard the city with tens of thousands of rounds. No houses in the city survived, and many gaps were also blasted in the city walls. When it was captured, only a few hundred living people were captured in the city. After that, Mr. Fu's basic troops were finished, and his confidence was lost. Then came the unexpected disastrous defeat of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. The backer was finished, and rescue was hopeless. Many people were wondering how two armies could hold Tianjin, which had vast suburbs, no city walls, and no city walls. Beiping had more than 2 million citizens and 300,000 troops, and had to consume at least more than 3 million catties of food every day. Even if the central government could send 500 planes to airdrop every day, each plane carrying two tons, it would still be of no avail, not to mention bullets and other supplies. Therefore, around New Year's Day in the 38th year, Mr. Fu's mood was extremely bad, and he often paced around the room, sullen and speechless, and even slapped himself on both cheeks, the sound shaking the outdoors. The suffering in his heart can be known from this. However, very few people outside knew about this situation, so the social order in Beiping was very good, and the morale was not low, because he was a famous general who defended the city, and everyone had confidence in him. I flew to Tanggu on January 8 to visit my sick father, taking the first passenger plane from Shanghai after the self-cut route. It was the 24th day after the siege, using the newly repaired Tiantan Airport. After leaving the airport, I saw that Tianqiao was still bustling and prosperous as before. Walking to Dongdan Archway, I saw a crowd of civilians busy repairing Dongdan Airport. Although the prices of rice, flour, pork, and vegetables were soaring, there was no shortage of goods on the market. Theaters and cinemas only had one less show in the evening due to the curfew. The entire city of Beiping, except for the fact that there were more troops on the streets, felt no different. However, the city gates were tightly closed, and sandbags were piled up at every important intersection. Every day at dawn or dusk, there would often be a small or large burst of dense gunfire. Several small and large shells flew to the vicinity of Fuchengmen and the north and south pools, killing a total of more than a dozen residents before and after. As for the movements of the Communist army outside the city, there was no way to know. (To be continued)

### Jessup Meets Schuman: US, British, and French Talks Begin; Discussing a Common Policy on German Issues

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Jessup, the US ambassador-at-large and representative to the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers meeting, will meet here today with British and French representatives to discuss the policies the three countries will adopt at the Foreign Ministers meeting. Jessup arrived here yesterday from the United States. Meeting with Jessup will be the French representative, Mr. Parodi, and the British representative, Mr. Coulson. According to a French Foreign Ministry spokesman, the purpose of this meeting is to determine in detail the coordination of policies among the three Western countries. These talks will continue until next week, and then, two days before the opening of the Foreign Ministers meeting on the 21st, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will personally attend the discussion. Jessup visited French Foreign Minister Schuman yesterday afternoon. Jessup solemnly denied the claim that the US government is considering withdrawing US troops stationed in Germany to a small area along the northern coast of Germany. He emphasized that this is not US policy.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] British Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Coulson, arrived here today from London. Mr. Steed, the political advisor to the Commander of the British forces stationed in Germany, had already arrived here earlier to attend the Three-Power Representatives meeting to assist Mr. Coulson.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] A State Department spokesman announced today that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will meet in Paris on May 21 to discuss how to implement the agreement on Germany reached in Washington on April 8. The spokesman also said that Secretary of State Acheson will leave here for Paris on the 20th and will meet with the foreign ministers of Britain and France on the 21st. The foreign ministers of the three countries will also review the results of the current talks between Ambassador-at-Large Jessup, State Department advisor Bohlen, and representatives from Britain and France.

[United Press, Moscow, 13th] With the lifting of the Berlin blockade proceeding smoothly, many ambassadors stationed here believe that the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers meeting has a chance of success. An ambassador from a certain country sends a telegram to his government every day reporting the same view, but is unwilling to make excessive predictions. The upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers meeting is the sole topic of conversation among the embassies of various countries here, although a few believe that this meeting is still bound to break down.

### Three Military Governors Approve West Berlin's Autonomy Regulations; Four Powers Negotiate to Restore Trade Relations

[United Press, Berlin, 14th] The military governors of the United States, Britain, and France today approved the autonomy regulations of West Berlin, which stipulate that Germans directly manage the administration of the western districts of Berlin, but the three commanders still retain broad supervisory powers, especially the power to disarm, demand reparations, conduct foreign relations, and manage German war criminals. The occupying forces also have the right to issue emergency orders to ensure the security, financial stability, and economic security of West Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 14th] The declaration of principles on the relationship between the Allied Control Council of West Germany and the administration of Greater Berlin was signed today in Berlin by the three commanders and delivered to the Berlin municipal government. The three commanders declared that, due to the special situation in Berlin, the occupation regulations of West Germany cannot be applied to Berlin, but the three commanders decided that, if possible, some lenient plans will be applied to Berlin, while retaining the rights of the Four-Power Control Council to guarantee the security, financial, and economic security of Berlin.

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] A British spokesman claimed tonight that the Four Powers held their first talks in Berlin today in many months, but he declined to disclose the details of the meeting. The news of this Four-Power meeting was first revealed by the Economic Minister of the West Berlin municipal government, Mr. Klingelhofer, who said at a press conference that representatives of Western countries met with Soviet representatives today to discuss the restoration of trade between Berlin and the West, and another meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.

### Provisional Institution to be Established Before the Formation of the West German Government; Organizing Committee to Handle Administration

[Reuters, Godesberg, Germany, 13th] The prime ministers of the West German states began meeting here today in order for the West German states to approve the constitution of the German Republic before the Four-Power Foreign Ministers meet on May 23. The three military governors yesterday authorized the West German prime ministers to begin preparations for the establishment of a federal government. They established three subcommittees today, one to find housing for the government, one to prepare legislation, and one to draft a government organization plan. If the constitution can be approved in time, it can be promulgated on the day the Foreign Ministers meeting is convened.

### Prices Fall in Berlin

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] Since the lifting of the Berlin blockade, food prices in West Berlin have fallen sharply, especially vegetable prices, which have fallen by about 60%. American coffee, previously sold on the black market for 28 marks per pound, fell to 15 marks today. The currency market has also reacted significantly, and the price of banknotes issued by the occupying forces has plummeted on the black market.

### US and Soviet Union Seek Understanding: War Can Be Avoided

[Reuters, London, 13th] The Bishop of Canterbury, Mr. Johnson, said in a speech here today that the Soviet Union definitely does not want war, and the events of the past few days are proof of this. When he traveled to the United States last year, he discovered that the general public in the United States also did not want war; they only wanted peace and understanding. He also said that the Marshall Plan has many contradictions, and we would rather tighten our belts than accept this kind of money.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Mr. Miliacas, a Labour Party Member of Parliament, said at a meeting of the British-Czech Friendship Alliance here today that there will be no war during the Labour Party's tenure, because the Labour government and the majority party in the House of Commons do not want Britain to participate in the war. He believes that the Atlantic Treaty is unnecessary, superfluous, and dangerous.

### UN General Assembly Passes Convention on Freedom of the Press; Protecting the Freedom of Foreign Journalists to Report

[United Press, New York, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly this morning passed the world's first treaty on freedom of the the press, called the "International Convention on the Transmission and Right of Correction of News." The vote was 33 to 6, with 13 abstentions and 7 absent. The Soviet bloc voted against. The full text of the convention has 23 articles, stipulating that reporters from newspapers, radio, and film in all countries will enjoy the right to report news in the United States and other democratic countries and to correct mistakes automatically. The convention will not require ratification by countries for seven months, because a large-scale news treaty will be drafted at the UN General Assembly's autumn meeting, and the two treaties will be submitted to the governments of all countries for ratification together in the future.

### Japanese Government to Request the Far Eastern Commission to Cancel All Reparations from Japan; US Decides Only to Stop Preliminary Reparations Plan

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] The Japanese government intends to request the Far Eastern Commission to completely stop reparations payments, so that Japan can engage in economic reconstruction. Mr. Yamaguchi, the director of the Japanese government's Reparations Bureau, expressed this intention in the House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee.

He said: The recent decision by the United States to suspend reparations payments only pertains to the plan for the initial 30% of reparations. He believes that the Far Eastern Commission has the right to decide on further reparations payments. He revealed that the Japanese government intends to have all factories designated for reparations fully operational.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese government officials hoped on the 14th that the United States would take action to cancel further Japanese reparations, as announced by the Far Eastern Commission, and they hoped that this move would mean the end of all reparations from Japan. A government spokesman told the National Assembly Committee that one-third of the removal plan in the 30% initial reparations plan had been completed in accordance with MacArthur's orders, and these factories were all former arsenals. He said that if the plan to stop further reparations is realized, then the 2.6 billion yen in reparations expenses in this year's budget may be used for other purposes. Mr. Shiga, a spokesman for the Japanese Communist Party, warned that the government should adopt a wait-and-see policy at present, because the plan to stop further reparations must be approved by the Far Eastern Commission.

### The Right to Decide on Reparations Should Be the Responsibility of the Far Eastern Commission; Opinions of Wu Bannong, Chinese Representative to Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Regarding the US government's order to suspend the Japanese reparations plan, Mr. Wu Bannong, the head of the Economic Group of the Chinese Mission in Japan, told the United Press today that, in the view of this mission, the United States should only abolish the directive on the early transfer plan and should not cancel its entire reparations plan. This entire reparations plan comes from Japan's war obligations. The Allied countries have legitimate demands for war losses and destruction. The final right to decide on reparations should be given to the Far Eastern Commission, in which all Allied countries are represented. Moreover, according to the Potsdam Declaration and the basic policy after Japan's surrender, a major purpose of the Japanese reparations issue is to eliminate its war potential, so that it can no longer launch aggressive wars against neighboring countries to endanger world peace. The early transfer plan only covers 30% of the Japanese government's arsenals. All of its aircraft factories and private arms factories have not been touched at all, not to mention the countless industries that assist in the war. These industries cannot contribute to Japan's economic life, because Japan has not yet been able to fully utilize its peaceful industrial equipment today. Finally, this mission cannot help but doubt whether the United States' current policy on the reparations issue is wise, but this is too important and should be left to future historians to judge.

### The Philippines Will Lodge a Strong Protest Against US Measures

[Associated Press, Manila, 14th] Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nali, said on the 14th that the US policy of stopping Japanese reparations payments is "a serious blow to us," and the government will immediately draft a strong protest to be submitted by Mr. Romulo, the Philippine Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Representative to the Far Eastern Commission. Nali said: "We can only appeal to the Quirino-Foster Agreement, which clearly stipulates the obligations of the countries occupying Japan. The US announcement completely caught us by surprise." Nali also said: "He will contact Romulo by radio to discuss this issue."

### More Than 600 Japanese Factories are Likely to Be Retained; Prices in Tokyo Stock Market Soar

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] Due to the United States' decision not to extract further reparations from Japan, 685 private factories and shipyards that have been designated for reparations will be retained, which will accelerate Japan's industrial and economic reconstruction. Although these factories designated for reparations are not fully operational, the 470 that are operational play a very important role in the reconstruction of Japan's post-war economy.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] Immediately after the United States announced its new policy of no longer extracting further reparations from Japan, stock prices in the stock market here soared. Some steel stocks rose by 50%, electricity stocks rose by 20% to 30%, and shipping company stocks rose by 35%.

### Iran Incorporates Indigenous People

[Reuters, Tehran, 13th] Iranian indigenous tribes, which have always been a problem for the Iranian central government, will be incorporated into the government's defense plan and become auxiliary forces of the army. It is estimated that there are about 4 million indigenous people in Iran, accounting for one-third of the country's population. Most of them live in the border mountains. After the incorporation, it will greatly benefit the promotion of domestic security.

### UN Political Committee Approves Plan to Dispose of Italian Colonies; Libya to Be Placed Under the Trusteeship of Three Countries: Britain, France, and Italy

[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Political Committee today passed a resolution by a vote of 34 to 16, largely approving the agreement reached between Britain and Italy on the future status of Italian colonies. There were seven abstentions in the vote. The agreement was reached in London last Monday between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, and includes the following recommendations:

(1) Cyrenaica in Libya will be placed under international trusteeship, with Britain as the governing authority. (2) The Fezzan region of Libya will have France as the governing authority. (3) Tripolitania in Libya will be placed under international trusteeship under Italian administration until the end of 1951. Before the end of 1951, it will continue to be governed by Britain, with an advisory committee composed of one representative each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, Turkey, and local residents assisting it. In addition, it is expressly stipulated that the aforementioned three measures shall not hinder the final merger of the three regions into a unified Libya. (4) Italian Somaliland will be placed under international trusteeship, with Italy as the governing authority. (5) Eritrea, except for its western part, will be incorporated into Abyssinia, and appropriate guarantees will be adopted to protect minority groups, but the two cities of Asmara and Massawa will draft their own city constitutions, provided that the provisions do not harm Abyssinian sovereignty. Western Eritrea will be incorporated into British-Egyptian Sudan.

The agreement including the aforementioned provisions will be submitted to the next UN General Assembly. However, the part regarding Tripolitania will be discussed by the Sixth UN General Assembly in 1951. The UN Trusteeship Council and a small-scale general assembly will participate in the drafting of these agreements. When the Political Committee voted on the proposal, the 34 countries that supported it were Britain, the United States, France, and countries in the Americas and Western Europe. The 16 countries that opposed it were the six countries in the Soviet bloc, the six countries in the Arab bloc, as well as India, Pakistan, Burma, and the Philippines. The seven countries that abstained were China, Haiti, Israel, Siam, Sweden, and Turkey.

### Syngman Rhee Opposes North-South Korean Conference

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 13th] Korean President Syngman Rhee stated: Even though US troops in South Korea will soon be withdrawn, there is no possibility of holding a conference between North and South Korea. Regarding the rumors about a North-South Korean conference, some people even believe that it is possible, and even hope that the North Korean puppet government may cooperate with the communists to occupy South Korea. However, he firmly believes that the general public knows who is spreading these rumors and what their purpose is. Rhee said: He first heard from Mr. Shaw, the representative of the United Nations Commission on Korea from Australia, that the committee is trying to contact North Korean leaders somewhere in Korea to formulate a plan for Korean unification. This may be Shaw's personal opinion. The committee does not want North and South Korea to hold a meeting.

[United Press, Rangoon, 14th] Burmese Foreign Minister, Mr. Ma Yi, said today that the British Commonwealth has agreed to provide financial and military assistance to the Burmese government to quell the unrest, and the Burmese people do not need to worry.

### The Depression of 1929 Will Not Be Repeated Today: Opinions of American Economists

[Washington, D.C., American News Service, 12th] On May 10, the Le Roy News Observer published an editorial entitled, "Have We Learned Our Lesson Enough?" stating: Renowned economist Soule published an article in the Sunday New York Times magazine, in which he presented a forceful affirmative answer to the question, "Have we learned our lesson enough from the situation in 1929?"

Mr. Soule listed the commonly recognized causes of the depression that began in 1929 and presented convincing evidence that various preventive measures have been established, which at least can prevent us from experiencing the same severe depression as that which occurred a decade ago. However, while there is no doubt that our country has learned from the experiences of 1929, the question is whether we have learned enough to avoid a milder depression. On this question, Mr. Soule's answer is less convincing, and only time can provide a complete answer. However, simply listing the various recognized causes of the last depression is enough to show that some past mistakes are not being repeated. Mr. Soule lists these causes as follows: the stock market crash; easy lending that led to excessive construction of skyscrapers and commercial buildings, a decline in the housing boom (which peaked in 1926); the excessive stimulation of the automobile industry market due to the popularity of installment plans, a false favorable balance of trade, which was maintained by unreliable foreign investment; special technological improvements that benefited large enterprises more than consumers, and (last but certainly not least) the suffering of farmers, because they were hit much harder in the initial depression than industry, so they later had no power to cope with the ensuing depression. Today, the huge profits obtained by companies are no greater than those obtained after World War I (until a few years ago it was proved that the profits obtained after World War I were fictitious). But with this one exception, there have been great improvements in the various situations listed by Mr. Soule since 1929. In the use of bank loans, we may have made the mistake of going too far. Many banks do not lend indiscriminately, but seem to have forgotten that lending is a bank's primary task. But of course, there will be no near-failure of banking business, which would deepen and prolong the last depression. The stock market is also in danger of collapsing, for the simple reason that the general public has withdrawn from the market, and speculators have to use their own money to trade. Private investment overseas is not adventurous on a large scale, and there is no excessive construction and artificial stimulation of the market for automobiles and similar things. Finally, the situation of farmers is much better than in 1929. Between 1940 and 1949, their mortgage debts decreased from $6.6 billion to $4.9 billion, and their cash on hand and bank deposits increased from $3.9 billion to $15.6 billion. In addition, they purchased $4.7 billion worth of government bonds. All this adds up to a gratifying picture. But on top of this picture, one indisputable fact must be added: the recent welcome price declines have produced an unwelcome increase in unemployment. What is the reason? Compared with 1929, it can be seen that prices are still very high, and many industries are still making unreasonably huge profits. But all in all, as long as people have cash to save and do not borrow recklessly, there is no great chance that the depression of 1929 will be repeated.

Snyder Denies That American Commerce Will Decline

[Washington, D.C., American News Service, 13th] U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder said that the current U.S. economy is exceptionally strong, although some people predict that American commerce will decline. On Thursday, Snyder spoke to bankers from across the country, stating that under the current circumstances, there are four powerful factors that can keep us stable at "high income and high employment levels." He listed these factors as follows: No speculation - "In the prosperous years after the war, there was practically no speculation. In the commercial history of our country, every recession has always been preceded by a large settlement of speculative accounts. The absence of this characteristic at present is, in my view, the most different from the previous periods of decline." Gradual adjustment of post-war industry - "Most of the past commercial recessions were unanticipated, and the recession became serious because many aspects of the economy were adjusted at the same time. However, the current situation is different. Adjustments to make the economy more genuinely competitive have actually been underway since the end of the war." High income levels and accumulation of savings - "One particularly noteworthy point is that consumer purchases are continuing to support high levels with income and are being maintained with savings reaching unprecedented records. Personal income in March of this year - the most recent figure known - is $214,000,000,000 on an annual basis. Although this figure is slightly lower than the all-time peak in December last year, it is still higher than the level a year ago. Personal liquid assets - another name for accumulated purchasing power - currently amount to $200 billion." Technological discoveries and inventions - "We are only at the beginning of peacetime development. We are just beginning to use the new materials, new manufacturing techniques and new equipment discovered during the war to manufacture new products. Just the wartime development of atomic energy alone can revolutionize our country's economic life in a few short years."

Yesterday's game between China Aviation and Zhichao met at Yiyuan Stadium at 4 p.m. The sun was scorching, and the audience was sparse, about five or six hundred people. The referee was Zhang Zhiren, and the linesmen were Li Guoyi and Chen Daohong.

Zhichao kicked off the attack, but was blocked. China Aviation launched frequent attacks. Yin Qingbing took the ball forward and shot hard at the upper right corner from the 20-yard mark, breaking the deadlock first. Xu Zuguo added fuel to the fire, approaching the goal and shooting. Gan Huizhong扑出, the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. Gan happened to reach back and catch it. Zhichao tried hard to counterattack. Xu Guoping sent the ball to the front of the goal. Sheng Peter's shot was unsuccessful. Wu Zhemin launched a cold shot, but it also went out of bounds. Zhou Xing was injured and left the field, and Gu Erlu replaced him. After many encounters, Yin Qingbing got a pass from Gao Xiuqing and broke in again, scoring with a low shot, making it 2-0. China Aviation was in high spirits. Yin Qingbing passed to the left, and Xu Zuguo caught up and shot, opening the Zhichao goal again. The first half ended with 3-0.

After the break, the two sides fought again. China Aviation's original lineup remained unchanged. Zhichao's Wu Qixiang opened the front line and took the lead. Sure enough, his power was doubled. Guan Chengchang launched an uprising on the periphery and moved towards the center. Wu Qixiang headed the ball in, breaking the net and pulling back a city. China Aviation retreated to defend and tried hard to defend. Neither side achieved anything. In the 41st minute, Zhichao continued to attack. Wu Zhemin passed to Guan Chengchang, and he shot diagonally into the net, trailing by one goal. However, time was tight, and although the generals of Zhichao tried hard, it was too late. Finally, Gao Xiuqing shot into the goal from the 20-yard mark. As a result, China Aviation won against Zhichao by 4-2.

### Haiguang Table Tennis Overwhelms You Si; Seven More B Group Games Today

In the fourth Table Tennis League, Haiguang faced off against You Si in Group B1 the day before yesterday. You Si's Zeng Yunjie showed his brilliance in six matches. Unfortunately, he encountered the deadly hands of Lingyun and Shanbao one after another last week, shaking his hopes of being selected. However, if he can remain undefeated afterwards, there is still a glimmer of hope. Haiguang is a strong team in the Silver Money Cup and the incarnation of the Shanghai Bank team. Its strength is very strong. It has played three times, winning two and losing one. This match against You Si is crucial to the future of both sides, so each sent its elite troops. The battle was fierce. Haiguang's Lu Jixing and Yang Yongkang were exceptionally brave, easily winning Groups 1 and 3 and leading all the way. You Si was at a disadvantage, relying on Yu Haishan and He Zhongzhi's desperate pursuit to win back Cities 2 and 4, tying the score at 2-2. The last group was the key to the final victory. You Si sent its main general Dai Lingchu on the stage. Haiguang originally listed two names as Yang Xixian and Ling Kecheng. Then, the team leader Lu Jixing had a flash of inspiration and ordered Ling Kecheng to meet the enemy. Ling is a draw, and his strength is abundant. The opponent Dai Ling considers himself good at guarding the ball, especially short blocks. Xiao Ling attacked with all his strength, and was exceptionally successful. Dai lost many winning opportunities due to psychological tension and gradually gave up. As a result, Ling did not disgrace his mission and defeated Dai Lingxu in two straight sets by a very close score. The whole team won the victory with 3-3. You Si lost this battle, and all hope was completely dashed. All efforts fell short, which is really unfortunate. The following is an exploration record of the battle results of the two teams and the recent situation table of the department:

### Flour Industry Trade Association Asks Central Bank for Emergency Loan

The factories of the Shanghai District Flour Industry Trade Association have only been operating for a few days a month since March due to lack of raw materials, and have recently all been suspended for the past week. However, the livelihoods of the factory employees have been maintained for several months, and all salary rates have been paid as usual. Therefore, the funds of the factory have been exhausted in this subsidy. Yesterday, the Shanghai District Flour Factory Association convened Fuxin, Fufeng, Yutong, Shenda, Huafeng, Jiancheng, Hongfeng, Xiefeng and other factories, and decided to send Qian Shouchun, Liu Shouqi and other representatives to the Central Bank to request an emergency loan of 600 billion yuan to maintain them, and requested the municipal government to find a way to order foreign wheat and allocate it to the factories for grinding.

### Private Cotton Textile Factories Pay Wages; Central Bank Agrees to Purchase Finished Products

[Report from This Newspaper] The private member factories of the Cotton Textile Association in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing and Shanghai districts have recently estimated that at least 8 trillion gold yuan will be needed to pay the wages for the first half of this month and pay for other payments. However, recently, finished products have been unsalable, and funds cannot be turned around, and difficulties have reached the extreme. After the association sent representatives to the Central Bank to request an emergency industrial loan, it was not approved. As a result, only the purchase of finished products was approved. It is heard that 2,500 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn were purchased yesterday, and the price was 640 million gold yuan per piece. All the price was to be paid for by giving 20% of the silver dollars (30 yuan of silver dollars per piece of cotton yarn) on the day the warehouse receipt was delivered, and 40% of the spot was paid. The rest will be settled on the 16th and 17th. According to the association, the civilian-run member factories in this city, including the weaving and dyeing parts, have a total of 80,000 workers. All the above-mentioned 20% of the silver dollars to be paid is enough for each worker to get one silver dollar. It is also heard that the state-owned Fangjian Company is also continuing to negotiate with the Central Bank for purchase.

### Importers and Exporters Guild Requests Reduction of Export Inspection Fees

[Our Report] The Importers and Exporters Guild of this city, based on complaints from member merchants, states that at a time when the current situation is tense and the government is encouraging the speedy transportation of export goods, the Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Station of the Ministry of Health suddenly notified all shipping companies in mid-April of this year that all export goods must be inspected by the station and a disinfection certificate issued before they can be shipped. The fee is a uniform 5.6 million Gold Yuan per metric ton, regardless of the type of goods, which not only increases the burden on merchants but also hinders the transportation of export goods. The guild has now submitted a request to relevant authorities to forward it to the station, requesting a reduction of export goods inspection fees and simplification of the certificate issuance procedures to facilitate transportation and benefit exports.

### Opening of Trial for Seven Defendants in Yinfeng Woolen Mill Theft Case

[Our Report] Jiang Lunzhang, Jiang Chuanxi, Wang Yongsheng, and others, in collusion with Yu Huaxiang and Zhang Hong, who are still at large, broke into the Yinfeng Woolen Mill at 1166 Guibei Road at approximately 1:00 AM on April 11th of this year by digging a hole in the wall. They stole 61 pieces of broadcloth, transported them to Jiang Lunzhang's manure boat, and took them elsewhere to divide the spoils. On the 13th of the same month, Jiang and the other two hired a boat to transport their share of the stolen goods to Suzhou. They were discovered and arrested by the police. Yu, on the 14th of the same month at approximately 11:00 AM, loaded the broadcloth onto a vehicle and drove to the Wuzhou Road small vegetable market, where he was stopped by police officers Bian Wenbao and Xu Dexiang. He then asked Zhu Lianxiu and Zhang Fujun to intercede on his behalf. They agreed to pay one tael of gold, 40 silver dollars, and one piece of serge. Since they did not have the cash, Zhu's wife, Wang, provided two gold rings, sold the broadcloth, and gave 40 silver dollars to Zhang, who passed it on to Bian and Xu. Yu then gave Zhu and Zhang each a piece of broadcloth as a reward. After the police discovered the crime, recovered the stolen goods, and sent them to the District Procuratorate for investigation, they have now charged Jiang and the other two with theft, Zhu and Zhang with bribery, and Bian and Xu with corruption. The first trial was held yesterday in the District Court. After questioning, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing. Zhu and Zhang each provided a shop guarantee and 10 million in cash as bail. Bian and Xu each provided a shop guarantee and 50 million in cash as bail, pending further summons.

### Sluggish Cotton Yarn Trading, Cloth Market Continues Downtrend, National Bank Purchases Cotton Yarn Yesterday

Cotton yarn trading is sluggish, with most stalls only quoting prices. Recently, factories have been unable to cope with current financial difficulties and are eager to sell. However, because prices of financial commodities outside the circle continue to decline, the market first fell and then stabilized. 42-count Blue Phoenix closed at 1,020,000,000, up more than 90 million. 32-count Silver Moon 760,000,000, up 100 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse warehouse receipts were not traded, and there were no price quotes. Spot price was 660,000,000, up 60,000,000. All counts below 20 rose sharply.

The Central Bank directly purchased cotton yarn from manufacturers yesterday morning, and sellers were enthusiastic. The bank's quoted prices were 960,000,000 yuan for 42-count yarn, 840,000,000 yuan for 32-count Silver Moon, and 640,000,000 yuan for 20-count yarn. Manufacturers were willing to sell because the purchase prices were higher than market prices, especially for 32-count and 20-count yarn. Most of the yarn sold by manufacturers was of mixed brands. The difference between the market price and the purchase price for 32-count yarn was as much as 100 million, and the difference for 20-count yarn was 64.4 million.

The cotton cloth market is continuing to decline. Merchants are particularly panicked and are rushing to sell. After the unofficial exchange rate of Yuan Yang occurred, although price quotes for Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi gabardine were very stable, their Gold Yuan value has risen sharply. At the morning opening, Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi gabardine were both trading at 15,600,000. Due to the soaring value of Gold Yuan notes, they once rose sharply together to 16,800,000, but near the close, profit-taking led them to close at 16,000,000. Longtou fine cloth remained flat compared to the previous day, while Sijunzi Yuan gabardine fell by another 400,000. Longtou B fine cloth traded at 14,800,000, also down 400,000. Wufu fine cloth rose slightly by 100,000, with the final transaction at 14,500,000. Santao fine cloth fell sharply by 1,000,000. Dasuanglong fine cloth closed at 14,000,000 in the afternoon. Private factory prices remained at their original levels, with little success in trading.

### Rice Prices Rise Sharply, Then Retreat Slightly

Yesterday's rice market saw merchants become wary because the authorities are about to take severe measures against wholesale-priced rice merchants. Retailers were also less inclined to buy because this period's household ration rice is about to be issued, and market sentiment eased, with prices retreating slightly.

Early Indica rice and Japonica were both trading at 40,000,000 yuan, while thick Japonica was 41,000,000 to 41,500,000 yuan. Due to the rise in Gold Yuan notes outside the market, owners of rice flour were firm in maintaining their prices. Although retail buyers were eager, prices were too high, and most adopted a wait-and-see attitude, making it impossible to conduct transactions.

### Slack Trading in Miscellaneous Grains, Flour and Oil All Fall

Raw rapeseed oil fell sharply by over 20,000, with spot prices closing at 102,000,000 in the afternoon, but it was still difficult to sell. Cooked rapeseed oil and sesame oil both fell.

### Fugitive Qiao Zhengrong Sentenced in the New New Cinema Robbery Case

[Our Report] Qiao Zhengrong, nicknamed Xiao Qiao, was friends with Xiao Hong, who is still at large. On the afternoon of December 4th of last year, instigated by Yang Zaichao, he and Xiao Hong, Ye Baoshan, Liu Quancheng, and others (all of the above have already been sentenced) went to the New New Cinema at 1154 Nanjing Road, holding iron bars and axes, intending to break into the box office and rob the ticket sales proceeds.

### Factories Applying for Temporary Industrial Loans Should Be Allowed to Participate Equally, City Chamber of Commerce Submits Request to the Bureau of Social Affairs

The City Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, urging that for factory loans, regardless of whether the applying factories are members of the Industrial Association or the Commercial Association, they should be allowed to participate equally in order to ensure fairness and avoid disputes. It stated: "This city's industrial sector is experiencing difficulty in paying wages in mid-month and has requested the National Bank to provide temporary loans. It has been decided to handle this in two ways: by purchasing finished products and by direct lending, and seven articles of temporary industrial loan measures have been drafted to carry out lending. However, the National Bank's current temporary industrial loans are still limited to factories belonging to the Industrial Association, which is unfair. The purpose of this operation is to alleviate the urgent mid-month wage payment difficulties of various manufacturers, but the business of producing daily necessities in this city is by no means limited to factories belonging to the Industrial Association. Many members of the Commercial Association also have factories that meet the loan qualifications. Due to the cessation of exports and weak domestic sales, they are equally unable to pay their employees' wages. The situation of manufacturers and workers who provide labor services should not be treated differently. In the past, China did not have the name "factory." All places where workers worked, regardless of their scale, were collectively referred to as "workshops." Later, with the development of production, the name "factory" came into being. However, whether they belong to commercial or industrial institutions, they are all factories with a large number of workers engaged in production, and the matter is the same. Therefore, all government measures to alleviate manufacturers' difficulties and safeguard workers' livelihoods should treat them equally, without discrimination. However, in the past, such things as the small industrial loans organized by the National Bank and the recent distribution of silver dollars to factories by the National Bank for wage payments, as well as the special rice allocation in the "Provisional Measures for Calculating Employee Salaries in This City" recently promulgated, are all specifically for member manufacturers of the Industrial Association, leaving workshops in commercial institutions out in the cold. This is not only unfair and unreasonable, but it also often leads to unnecessary disputes between labor and management. Workers who understand reason only lament that the government's handling of affairs is not entirely fair, while workers who do not understand reason may believe that since they are all workers, there should be no deliberate discrimination, and will say that the factory is eager to fight for it, or even suspect that it is deliberately playing tricks to profit from it. As a result, labor-management disputes have arisen repeatedly, and their plight is indescribable. Therefore, we are earnestly presenting the facts and requesting that you quickly forward this to the Central Bank, stating that for this temporary industrial loan, all factories, regardless of whether they have joined the Industrial Association or the Commercial Association, should be allowed to participate equally in order to ensure fairness and avoid disputes."

### Committee Passes Measures for Next-Day Deposits and Silver Dollar Distribution

[Central News Agency] The following measures for handling next-day deposit balances of various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms were passed yesterday at a meeting of the National Bank Appropriations Committee:

"Although the supply of banknotes by this bank has recently become more generous, it is still insufficient to meet actual needs. Therefore, in addition to providing as much cash as possible for the next-day deposit balances of various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms, it is still necessary to distribute fixed-amount promissory notes and silver coins. The total amount of deposits is greater than the amount deposited in this bank, and we have been unable to pay depositors in proportion to the number of silver coins issued by this bank. Outsiders are not aware of the truth and cannot avoid misunderstandings. In order to take both factors into account, the plan is to require all banks, bureaus, and commercial firms to report the total amount of deposits and the amount of silver coins in their vaults to this bank at the end of each business day, starting from today. When paying deposits the next day, the proportion of silver coins to be distributed should be based on the ratio of the total amount of deposits to the number of silver coins available from this bank on that day. Any amount less than one silver dollar should be paid in Gold Yuan notes, and it should be publicly announced outside the business counter so that everyone is aware."

### Gold Prices Rise All the Way as All Parties Strive to Acquire It

Trading was once chaotic, with demand exceeding supply. The highest price approached the 3.36 billion daily limit. Upon hearing this, the Central Bank continued to sell, entrusting Da Decheng to sell unlimitedly at a price of 3.2 billion. Gold shops found demand excellent, selling a total of more than 219 large bars. Market sentiment remained firm, and prices closed at 3.2 billion, up 350 million from the previous day.

Off-exchange opening prices were 2.9 billion, 3.1 billion, dropping to 2.8 billion, 3.0 billion, and rising to 3.2 billion, 3.4 billion. The afternoon closing prices were 3.1 billion, 3.3 billion. Afternoon trading was sluggish, and market sentiment was bullish, with prices rising again to 3.2 billion, 3.4 billion at the close, also up 450 million.

Yesterday, the off-exchange market for US dollars was active due to the vigorous sales by various gangs. There were quite a few people who sold silver for US dollars, and the market led the way. The morning opening was 5.5 million, 6 million, dropping to 5.3 million, 5.8 million, and rising to 6 million, 6.5 million. The afternoon closing fell slightly to 5.8 million, 6.3 million. In the afternoon, market sentiment was firm, rising again to 6 million, 6.5 million, breaking through the 6 million mark, up 700,000 from the previous day.

### The Wellspring of Agricultural Production and the Engine of Economic Prosperity: Taiwan Cooperative Bank

— Xin Shi

[Taipei News] The cooperative enterprises of this province already had a considerable foundation during the Japanese occupation. However, it only served as a tool for the empire's economic plunder and control, and a means to alleviate capital monopoly, which was completely different from the principle of equality in our economic system of people's livelihood. After the Retrocession, the provincial authorities established cooperative institutions and carried out a comprehensive reorganization. Over the past two years, through continuous efforts and smooth development, the foundation has gradually been consolidated. There are currently 527 cooperative societies with 720,000 members, spread throughout the province. In terms of business, the emphasis is on supporting the production of fisheries and agriculture, so that the sales of special products and the supply of raw materials can develop in a balanced manner. This achievement is due to the fact that the provincial authorities consider the prosperity of cooperative enterprises as the most important key to the province's society.

Reorganization Process

The cooperative financial institution before the Retrocession was called the Taiwan Industrial Association Federation, which was established in 1942. In 1943, it was renamed the Taiwan Industrial Bank, handling deposit, loan, and remittance businesses. After the Retrocession, it temporarily maintained its original state. It was not until October 1946 that the current Cooperative Bank was established, with a capital of NT$25 million. In addition to the NT$15 million subscribed by the provincial government and related agencies, the purpose was to promote the economic life of the people of this province, and the task was to regulate the capital of the cooperative enterprises in this province. It was by no means purely focused on profit-making, so it could practice the principle of joint ownership, joint operation, and joint sharing, and expand the scope of investment to provide the necessary funds for cooperative enterprises, so as to improve the social and economic life of cooperative members. Moreover, because it is essentially more stable and safe, in addition to regulating funds and promoting the development of cooperative enterprises, it can also achieve the effect of assisting the government in stabilizing the financial situation of the province's society.

Organizational Outline

The internal organization of the bank is quite large. The decision-making body is the Board of Directors, which is responsible for implementing the resolutions of the shareholders' meeting, determining business policies, and reviewing various regulations. A Board of Supervisors is also set up to be responsible for supervising the bank's financial situation and the execution of business operations. The Board of Directors has 11 directors, including 7 public directors and 4 private directors. The Board of Supervisors has 5 supervisors, including 3 public supervisors and 2 private supervisors. The head office has a general manager, two assistant managers, and five departments, including general affairs, accounting, cashier, auditing, and research, as well as two departments, including business and trust. In order to meet the needs of the society, branch institutions have been established in important areas, including six locations in Taipei, Hsinchu, Tainan, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and the Eastern region, as well as 55 agency units throughout the province. In February of last year, in order to handle business quickly, the Taipei branch was abolished, and its business was directly handled by the business department of the head office. In order to promote the rural economy of Taitung, the Eastern branch was changed to Hualien branch to handle Hualien business exclusively, and a Taitung branch was established separately in Taitung. Recently, branches are being planned in Chiayi, Changhua, Yilan and other places, and it is expected that they will open soon.

Current Business

Since the official establishment of the bank, thanks to the painstaking planning of the general manager and the joint efforts of the general staff, the business has been thriving. The main business can be roughly divided into six parts: deposits, loans, remittances, acting as a public treasury, distributing stamp tax tickets throughout the province, and acting as an agent for household sugar allocation. The details are as follows: (1) Deposits: The deposits absorbed by the bank are mostly rural funds. In the past, due to the need for funds in rural areas and the fact that the credit cooperative management regulations had not yet been announced, the number of deposits from various cooperative organizations could not reach the ideal level. However, after the bank's efforts to persuade them, the total number of deposits has increased month by month, and the increase has been even faster in recent years.

(2) Loans: The bank's lending targets are mainly cooperative organizations. In order to cooperate with the government's policy of stabilizing commodity prices, loans are mostly focused on rural production and fishery production. As long as the borrower's credit is obvious, the period is suitable, and the purpose is normal, the loan can be granted after review. The procedures are very simple and the interest rate is very low, so the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic in recent years.

(3) Remittance Business: The bank has widely established agency offices throughout the province. In order to facilitate financial circulation, it started remittance and collection services in January of the year before last. The procedures are simple, the fees are low, and it is not limited to cooperative organizations. Individuals can also entrust remittances and collections. Since its opening, due to the obvious social credit and the rapid remittance procedures, the people of the province have praised it as convenient, so the remittance business has become very developed.

(4) Acting as a Public Treasury: The public treasury of this province is managed by the Bank of Taiwan, but the Bank of Taiwan entrusts the bank to act as an agent in places where it does not have branch institutions, and is responsible for collecting and resolving the funds required by various agencies and various income. Currently, there are 93 units acting as public treasuries, including Taoyuan.

(5) Distributing Stamp Tax Tickets Throughout the Province: The bank is entrusted by the Provincial Department of Finance to sell stamp tax tickets throughout the province, and designates each contributing cooperative as a distribution point, and also establishes retail points in key areas. Currently, there are more than 400 distribution points, spread throughout the remote areas of the province, which is of great benefit to the national treasury revenue.

(6) Acting as an Agent for Household Sugar Allocation: In July 1947, the bank was ordered by the Provincial Government to handle the allocation of household sugar throughout the province, with each period being two months. Each person can receive half a kilogram of sugar per period. The number of people receiving the allocation per period is more than 6.5 million. The selling price is lower than the market price, and the allocation is meticulous, so the people of the province benefit greatly.

In addition, in terms of agency business, the bank has also handled the follow-up relief fertilizer款, which is collected and transferred to the Bank of Taiwan by the bank, as well as the payment for the purchase of tobacco leaves by the Tobacco Leaf Company, which is paid by the Taichung and Hualien branches of the bank. It also handles trust business.

Future Plans

In order to review the past and plan for the future, the bank also intends to make the following improvements to the future business policy: (1) Establish more branches and strengthen the business of agency offices: The province is vast, and it is still difficult to penetrate into the people and provide universal services. Therefore, it is specially planned to establish several more branches in important areas, and after the establishment of more branches, adjust, allocate, supervise, and manage the agency offices that are entrusted to handle the nature of the business, so as to facilitate the promotion of business. (2) Absorb as much deposits as possible and simplify procedures: There is abundant floating capital in this province recently, and commodity prices are fluctuating. In order to assist the government in stabilizing finance, the bank intends to order various branches to absorb as much deposits as possible from cooperative organizations, and use these deposits as agricultural production funds for lending, so as to guide floating capital into production enterprises and stabilize finance. As for the loan procedures, we will also strive to make them simple and quick, and extend the loan period as appropriate according to the nature of the loan, so as to achieve the effect of increasing production. (3) Strengthen trust business: The total number of cooperative members in this province is more than 700,000. In order to avoid the intermediate exploitation of merchants, the procurement and supply of daily necessities for members, and the consignment and sales of members' products, we will coordinate with various federations and strive to serve them in the future, so as to reduce the burden on members and stabilize general commodity prices.

This is the source of agricultural production in this province, and at the same time, it is the artery that stabilizes the economy and prospers the local area.

### Yugoslavia: An Appendix

— Translated by Zhen Jun

Discriminated against by Tito, and even encountering resistance due to Tito, just when the Soviet Union was smoothly conducting negotiations on the Austrian peace treaty, Tito put forward Yugoslavia's demands for Galicia, making the whole problem chaotic and difficult to reach a consensus. Regarding the issue of demanding the return of the entire port to the South, because of Stalin's ambition and attempt to intervene, he was greatly troubled and wanted to embarrass him in front of the Four Powers. Later, Tito lobbied Bulgaria and Greece, all of which showed that Tito did not pay much attention to Moscow's instructions in terms of pace and time, and acted directly and automatically. Tito's Balkan plan was to unite the Balkan countries with Yugoslavia as the center and form the Balkan Alliance. The motivation for this approach was mainly to guard against Soviet encroachment on the South. However, this is clearly contrary to Stalin's ultimate goal of encompassing the entire Balkans and joining the Soviet Union as one of the Soviet republics.

Stalin's plan in the Balkans was to first unite Yugoslavia and Bulgaria and combine them into a

Southern Slavic race A great alliance, and listen to the leadership of Moscow. Then, the next step was to implement the policy of controlling Tito, and at the same time strengthen the party's organization and strength. Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgi Dimitrov said that he would act alone and accept the plan of Chairman Stalin, if that was feasible. But Tito refused, and this unpleasant statement suddenly rigidified the whole situation, and an open friction occurred between Stalin and Tito.

Tito has his own independent thoughts and consciousness. He believes that, except in the Soviet Union itself, Stalin's words are not necessarily law, so other satellite countries can naturally take independent actions. This statement, in Stalin's ears, is clearly a contemptuous insult. Communists in other European countries do not have the courage to say such things publicly, and even if they accidentally hear it, they must hurry away quietly.

The basis for Tito's gambling action is that he clearly sees that, in Stalin's current situation, he will not rashly send powerful military forces to subvert his existing position. At the same time, the masses who support him still have confidence in him, and will increasingly resist any weaker attacks from outside.

Stalin's victory has been greatly discounted by Tito. When the Soviet Union takes any military action to warn other vassal states, it may arouse strong resentment. Therefore, it is better to destroy the abstract thematic concepts of each vassal state, that is, to intervene by means of economic recovery, which is more appropriate and reliable. This situation is now spreading throughout the Soviet Union. Tito's biggest bet is the broad support force in Yugoslavia. The former Chief of Staff of Yugoslavia, who was greatly favored by Stalin and far superior to Tito himself, was killed immediately when he tried to flee the country. The support Tito can get in the country will certainly not be 100% satisfactory, but he is prepared to take the toughest measures against his opposition party.

The leaders of the communist parties in each province have now been purged. Two cabinet members who disagreed were also asked to leave. Under Tito's control, there is a well-trained secret police force, and most of the troops are loyal to him. The people of Yugoslavia will naturally not welcome dictatorship, but they would rather have a ruler who has all the power in Belgrade than have this figure live in distant Moscow.

Tito's all-or-nothing adventure has been carefully considered, and this retaliatory opportunity often exists. Those

Kremlin agents can successfully give him a head-on blow, so that he can never get up again. Yugoslavia naturally has economic difficulties, and it is likely to form a greater danger, requiring external assistance. Some people have also speculated that Stalin will give Yugoslavia greater pressure, so that they will turn against Tito.

In fact, the Soviet offensive has already begun. Those kerosene supplies from Romania have now been cut off. Moscow's political workers secretly infiltrated the South to create difficulties for Tito. At the same time, those nerve wars directly manipulated by Moscow, from every corner of the Soviet empire, have now been placed in front of Tito. But on the other hand, Stalin's failure to liquidate Tito may also have its own value.

The spread of Titoism's independent thinking stayed in Stalin's mind.

Worrisome Big Problem Bulgaria's Dimitrov's tendency is frustrating, because his loyalty to Moscow falls behind the ideal. Czech Prime Minister Klement Gottwald also seems unable to make all the Czech people wholeheartedly support Stalin. The leaders of the Polish Communist Party are also slow to gather the farmers in each village and reluctantly obey Stalin's orders. Therefore, if Tito is let go lightly without punishment, then the other vassal states that the Kremlin can control may be greatly infected and become a crisis.

At the same time, due to the rift between Stalin and Tito, and the possibility of a complete seam is unlikely for a while, this will be a rare opportunity for Western European countries. The good opportunity that this rift gives to Western European countries is that they will use the ready-made materials and put a lot of effort into business and propaganda to deal with Stalin. In addition, there may be more exciting good shows later. Therefore, for his own benefit, Stalin must take action to punish Yugoslavia. Recently, he will not have much spare mood to cause too much conflict with other countries until he has completely blocked this loophole. (Translated from World Report Magazine)

### Jinshan Enters Wartime Phase: Tight Defense Arrangements

[Our newspaper Jinshan, 10th] Since the retreat of our troops from Jiaxing, troop movements here have been frequent, and the people's hearts have become more tense. Recently, the buses and ships from Jinshan to Songjiang and from Zhujing to Fengjing have been closed for many days, and there are very few merchants coming and going. The market is in a slump, and silver shops, rice shops, restaurants, and taverns have also closed down one after another. Only small shops and vendors are still operating as usual, but they all feel that it is not easy to replenish the goods they sell. The bosses sigh with sorrow all day long!

The current Jinshan has entered a wartime phase. The county security team is now closely cooperating with the national army to closely deploy defenses. The police organs maintain order day and night. County Magistrate Wang, Regiment Leader Zhang, Bureau Chief Sun, etc. are all sitting in the urban area to command and ensure the current security of the streets.
