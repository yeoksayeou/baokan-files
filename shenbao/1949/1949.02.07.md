### Unofficial Expressions from the CCP: Welcoming Shao and Zhang to Go North for Discussions; Beijing People's Delegation Arrives in Ping from Qingdao

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Amidst the government's efforts to strive for peace, in addition to the Shanghai Peace Delegation's work to knock on the door of peace being about to commence, according to well-informed sources: the CCP has already made unofficial expressions regarding the government's peace representatives, welcoming Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong to go to Ping and discuss with them. Shao Lizi has not given positive confirmation regarding the above information, but he has also not denied it. As for how the CCP's opinion was expressed, relevant parties did not explicitly state. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, General Zhang Zhizhong, who returned to Lanzhou on official business a few days ago, will soon return to Nanjing from Lanzhou, but the exact date is still undetermined.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Mr. Huang Shaohong, who had just arrived in Beijing from Hankou on the 5th, continued to visit Acting President Li on the morning of the 6th, and then flew to Shanghai by plane at noon.

[Our Dispatch] Gan Jiehou has completed the organization of the city's peace delegation after spending two days in Shanghai. Mr. Gan flew to Beijing again at 10:30 yesterday morning to pay respects to Acting President Li to request instructions on the date of departure, and to study the technical issues of conducting peace talks. It is expected that he will return to Shanghai with Shao Lizi within two days, and then depart immediately. The various peace representatives of the city are quietly awaiting Mr. Gan's return before determining the date of departure. There were no formal meetings held between them yesterday.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Gan Jiehou, who is busily traveling between Nanjing and Shanghai, flew back to Beijing from Shanghai by plane on the afternoon of the 6th. After getting off the plane, Mr. Gan drove to Acting President Li's residence to report, and visited Huang Shaohong, Huang Xuchu, Shao Lizi, and others to exchange opinions on peace issues.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] After Gan Jiehou arrived in Beijing on the 6th, he spent from noon until evening at Acting President Li's residence, discussing the relevant issues of the peace talks in detail. Around 10 p.m. on the evening of the 6th, he spoke with Shao Lizi on the phone, and arranged to meet on the 7th. Mr. Gan has scheduled to fly to Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 8th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Shao Lizi went to the Jieshou Hall on the evening of the 6th at the invitation of friends to watch a play, and returned to his residence at 8 o'clock, feeling very happy in spirit.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 6th] The Beijing People's Peace Delegation took a China Aviation Corporation special plane No. 131 to Ping at 2 p.m. on the 6th. Although the six accompanying reporters have already traveled with them, the square still refused during a wireless telephone conversation on the morning of the 6th. Before the plane took off (10 a.m.), Qingdao and Ping first contacted each other by telephone, and the China Aviation Corporation radio station immediately opened up, reporting that the situation was good. The plane took 470 kilograms of mail from Qingdao.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Eleven Nanjing People's Peace Representatives flew from Qingdao on a China Aviation Corporation plane and arrived at the Xiyuan Airport here at 6 p.m. The plane was fired upon by anti-aircraft artillery before it contacted the ground during the trip, but there was no damage. Five journalists came along, including one woman. After landing, the pilot and journalists were not allowed to leave the airport. The representatives then drove to the Six Nations Hotel in the city to meet with lower-level CCP officials, and are scheduled to meet with Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Beiping Military Control Commission, on the morning of the 7th.

### Premier Sun's Remarks: The Government's Move South is Not a Relocation of the Capital; Continued Efforts Towards Peace; Firm Rejection of the Handover of War Criminals

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 6th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke received reporters here on the afternoon of the 6th. He said that this was his first official reception of reporters since taking office as Premier of the Executive Yuan. He first described the process of forming the cabinet, stating briefly: At that time, it was decided to seek "glorious peace," and it was by no means a surrender cabinet. He has always advocated resolving domestic problems through peace, but should seek a reasonable solution, and must not discuss peace after being subdued by force. The government's move to Guangzhou this time is to avoid the threat of war. Because what the government seeks is peace, it must never make a treaty under duress. After President Chiang's retirement, the method of moving to Guangzhou was discussed with all parties and instructions were sought from Acting President Li. The final decision was made on January 25. At that time, Acting President Li and the heads of various Yuan and Ministries were present, and unanimously agreed. Therefore, this was actually decided under the instructions of Acting President Li, and was not the sole action of the Executive Yuan. The government is only relocating its office, and is not relocating the capital. After the Executive Yuan moves, the government will continue to work towards peace without being threatened by war. Tracing back to the announcement of President Chiang, the Executive Yuan immediately issued a statement in response, requesting both sides to first cease fire and then send representatives to discuss, so as to prevent the people from suffering the pain of war. However, the CCP actually considered this to be closing the door to peace, which is quite puzzling. Later, President Chiang announced his retirement, expressing his determination to seek peace, and immediately nominated five representatives to prepare for peace talks with the CCP. However, the CCP again stated: "It must wait until Beiping is completely liberated" before making a decision, but there has been no news to date. In the past week, Acting President Li also believed that waiting was not a solution, so he advocated that representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai first send representatives to knock on the door of peace. However, when they can depart is still unknown. However, the government is still not discouraged by this, because I have always opposed civil war, and this mission is to promote peace. He also said: After the victory, some people advocated resolving domestic problems through war, and I strongly opposed it. Now those who advocate war are feeling fearful, because if old scores are settled, it will take a long time to tell. At present, in order for the people to live and work in peace and contentment, and to live at an appropriate level, and at the same time to be friendly with both Eastern and Western allies, the government is relocating its office to work towards peace. At the end, he replied to reporters' inquiries: (1) A total of 18 cabinet members, 12 have arrived in Guangzhou, and a formal political affairs meeting will be held on the 7th. (2) The Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans have arrived here, and there is no objection to the government's relocation. (3) Acting President Li has not ordered the various ministries and Yuans to move back to Nanjing. Before peace is realized, they should maintain close contact. (4) The government is acting as a whole after moving to Guangzhou. His opinions do not differ from those of Acting President Li. (5) Peace is not completely hopeless. (6) Acting President Li has expressed his intention to come to Guangzhou. (7) When he will return to Beijing is undecided. (8) Beijing and Shanghai can absolutely be defended. (9) Absolutely and strictly refuse to hand over war criminals. If peace cannot be realized, he will only negotiate with the CCP to the end.

### Weng Wenhao Decides to Return to Beijing to Assist in Peace Talks

[Our Tainan Dispatch, 6th] Weng Wenhao returned to Chiayi on the 6th after inspecting the oil refinery in Kaohsiung. He is scheduled to go to Taipei on the 7th. He has decided to go to Beijing to assist Acting President Li in peace talks. Mr. Weng met with reporters twice in the oil refinery and on the train, and was still earnestly inquiring about the printing of the Shen Bao map. He smiled and said that these things need to be completed under a stable situation, just like the oil refinery here.

### Mo Dehui Will Fly to Taiwan Immediately; The Story of His Disappearance is Groundless

[Our Dispatch] Mo Dehui will fly to Taiwan within one or two days to discuss the matter of releasing Zhang Xueliang. The rumor that Mr. Mo is missing is inaccurate. According to his family's words to reporters: Mr. Mo is presiding over the distribution of relief funds for refugees of public education personnel in the Northeast in Shanghai, which is quite hard work. In recent days, due to high blood pressure, he followed the doctor's advice and moved to Zhongshan Hospital for recuperation. Yesterday morning, groups of refugees from the Northeast visited Mr. Mo at the hospital. After many conversations, he felt quite tired, so he left the hospital at noon to go to the residences of his friends Ding Guitang and Shi Bingchen for rest. In the afternoon, he went to the homes of other friends for a short stay. The story of his disappearance is groundless.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] Mr. Mo Dehui from the Northeast, in order to provide relief to the refugees from the Northeast in Shaanxi, remitted 100,000 yuan in relief funds from Beijing at the beginning of the year, entrusting the Northeast Bureau Rural Association here to distribute them. The association has completed the registration, and the distribution will start on the 5th, with 120 yuan for a large household and 60 yuan for a small household, totaling 792 registered refugees.

### Mao Zedong is in Shijiazhuang; Zhang Dongsun Has Met with Him

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Non-Communist political circles here expect that Beiping will become the site of the National People's Congress in the coming months to discuss China's new constitution and other matters.

Professor Zhang Dongsun of Yenching University returned to Ping from Shijiazhuang on the 4th. He told friends that CCP Chairman Mao Zedong is also in Shijiazhuang and has met with him several times. Mr. Mao may come to Ping for a visit, but the date is undecided. The National People's Congress cannot be held before March at the earliest.

### Peace Conference of Seven Provinces and Cities Opened in Wuchang Yesterday; Representatives from Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan Have Not Arrived Yet

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] The People's Peace Promotion Association of seven provinces and cities invited by people from Hubei Province opened in Wuchang at 2 p.m. on the 6th. More than 20 representatives from the people of Hunan, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hankou attended. First, Chiang Chi-yi, Speaker of the Guangxi Provincial Assembly, gave an opening speech, pointing out that the government has adopted peaceful measures, but the CCP has not made any concrete expressions for peace. In the future, the people should urge the CCP to accept the call for peace. Then representatives from various provinces and cities gave speeches. Wang Yuanyi and Mao Bingwen, representatives from Hunan, expressed dissatisfaction with the CCP's attitude and advocated that the people should give advice to the party that delays peace. Zhou Jie, Chen Shi, and others, representatives from Hubei, emphasized that the people should always maintain a third-party stance, be impartial and unbiased, and earnestly plead with both sides to cease fire. Because representatives from Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan provinces are still on their way, no specific discussions were held at today's meeting. However, the majority of opinions were in favor of sending representatives to the CCP area to negotiate peace, and to recognize Mr. Li Xucheng, who has already gone to Ping to seek peace, as a legitimate representative. (Note: Mr. Li is going to the Communist area as the leader of the liaison group of the Hubei Provincial People's Peace Promotion Association.)

### Legislators Remaining in Shanghai Resolved to Resume Meeting in Nanjing in the Middle of the Month; Tong Guanxian and Yu Youren Fly to Guangzhou

[Our Dispatch] More than 130 legislators remaining in Shanghai held a discussion meeting starting at 3 p.m. yesterday, and elected Zou Shuwen as chairman. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m. At yesterday's meeting, legislators Jiang Yiping, Chen Guyuan, Fang Zhichao, and others first reported on the preparatory process, followed by Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, reporting on the recent situation of the Yuan in three points. Finally, the legislators had a heated discussion on the issues of resuming the third session and the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou. The legislators spoke enthusiastically, and some were emotional. In the end, four points were unanimously resolved: (1) In order to promote peace talks and stabilize people's hearts, the third session will be resumed in Nanjing. (2) The date of resumption will be set for February 15 of this year. (3) How to prepare transportation in Nanjing in case of emergency, please Secretary Chen of the Legislative Yuan handle. (4) The colleagues attending today will jointly send a telegram to President Tong, who has gone to Guangzhou, to notify him of today's decision, and ask him to invite his colleagues in Guangzhou to come to Beijing for the resumption of the meeting, and send separate telegrams to colleagues in various places to handle it in unison.

Also, the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Legislative Yuan has now decided to be temporarily located at the former Frontline Daily News Agency at No. 1 Harbin Road, Shanghai. The director is Wang Kexiang. It is heard that there are now more than 220 legislators remaining in Shanghai.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian and President of the Control Yuan Yu Youren left Beijing on a Chasing Clouds special plane at 10 a.m. on the 6th and flew to Guangzhou. Shao Lizi, Zhang Yaoming, and many others went to the airport to see them off. The two Presidents Yu and Tong went to Guangzhou, in addition to visiting Premier Sun, and also had discussions with the legislative and supervisory members in Guangzhou. They will leave Guangzhou and return to Beijing in three days.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 6th] The two Presidents Yu and Tong arrived here at 3 p.m. on the 6th on Acting President Li's plane. Premier Sun personally accompanied them from the airport to Dongyuan for rest. Yu and Sun had a secret talk for one hour. Yu later told his friends that he came at the invitation of Premier Sun, and that he very much wanted to visit the old place he had been away from for more than ten years, and to solicit opinions on national affairs from people here. He denied that he came to urge Premier Sun to return to Beijing. He believes that the opinions of the Executive Yuan and the government should be consistent. Because he is a member of the central government, he came south once to avoid external instigation, but he must return to Beijing in three days, because the Supervisory Council is scheduled to be held in Beijing in the middle of this month. He immediately met with the wife of Supervisory Committee member Qing Shen'an, tears welling up in her eyes, and promised to do his best to handle Qing's funeral affairs.

Also, Xu Kan, Guan Jiyu, Duanmu Kai, Liu Weichi, Pang Songzhou, and others all flew here on the afternoon of the 6th.

### President Chiang May Go to Xiamen; A Mansion on Gulangyu Has Been Repaired

[United Press Xiamen Dispatch, 6th] It is rumored that President Chiang has arrived in Xiamen. This statement is definitely not true, but according to reports here, Mr. Chiang may come to Xiamen recently, because the Third Gendarmerie Regiment has been dispatched from Nanjing and is stationed on Gulangyu. The Lizi Society has also repaired and decorated a mansion at the foot of Tuoyan Mountain on the northern end of Gulangyu. The house is owned by a wealthy overseas Chinese and has not been inhabited for a long time since the Japanese occupied it. Xiamen is a transportation hub for the four provinces of Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Navigation and flight are very convenient. Gulangyu has always been considered the safest place in South China. Mr. Chiang had a good impression of it when he visited Gulangyu in 1922 and 1923.

It is learned that the Communist army in northern Henan is frequently mobilizing, seemingly attempting to attack Xinxiang.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 6th] In order to ensure the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, its corps has been stationed in Jiangling.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] A spokesman for the Capital Garrison Command told a United Press reporter that the Communist army has no intention of forcibly crossing the Yangtze River at any stronghold on the north bank of the Yangtze River. It is rumored that a large number of Communist troops are now active in a certain base in Tianmu Mountain on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, but this has been the case for several months.

(2) There is no news of the two chairmen Gu (Zhenglun) and Lu (Han) coming to Chongqing. Whether Zhang will convene a southwest military and political conference has not yet been decided; he will return to Xichang after Zhang takes office. (3) Zhang said about the peace talks that the government is indeed sincere, but if the Communist Party's conditions are harsh, it will be difficult to handle. (4) Xichang (including the Ning District) is extremely stable. The exchange of cotton yarn is popular. Regardless of war or peace, it is extremely difficult for the Communist Party to want the Yi area. The Yi ethnic group's visit to Beijing to tour has influenced the Yi ethnic group's thinking. Recently, many wild Yi have come to surrender. The chieftains hope that the government will pay money, and they will provide labor. It would be best to build a railway. (5) Regarding the Lei Mountain Risk Control Team, because the mountain is high and the weather has been bad recently, they have not yet set off.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 6th] Zhang Qun personally directed the attempt to defend against the Communist army's intrusion into Sichuan.

### Beiping Removes Sandbags and Artillery Positions; Courts Taken Over by the Communist Army; Financial Markets Remain Chaotic

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Beiping is removing sandbags, artillery positions, and other remnants of the 40-day siege, and is restoring normalcy. Ye Jianying and other senior personnel have not yet met with Chinese and foreign reporters, nor have they had contact with the consuls of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In addition, the Communist army continues to take over various agencies, and the courts have also been taken over.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The financial market in Beiping remains chaotic.

### Zhou Yide Urges the State Department to Approve the Revival of the Flying Tigers

[United Press Washington, 5th] Congressman Zhou Yide strongly urged the State Department on the 5th to approve the revival of the "Flying Tigers" to help China resist the Communist Party. Zhou said that, according to what he knows, 4,000 people have requested to follow General Chennault in this adventure. State Department sources said that the State Department is very unlikely to change its policy of non-interference in the Chinese civil war and approve this action. Zhou said that the State Department's ruling could establish the Flying Tigers, and he believes that the State Department can make this decision. "Road Explorer" magazine said that the American volunteer base in this proposal has been established in Taiwan, and "the supply line for the Flying Tigers' application is available." It is reported that supporters of this plan are the Air Force Federation, which is composed of former members of the Fourteenth Air Force in China. "Road Explorer" magazine quoted Arthur, a former Fourteenth Air Force pilot and current advertiser, as saying that if this plan is approved, the first plane can take off within two days.

### A Harmonious Atmosphere Envelops the Entire Xinjiang; Bao Erhan Says That Personnel from Ili Will Eventually Return to Dihua; Local Trade Between China and the Soviet Union Will Become More Active

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 6th] Xin province Chairman Bao Erhan met with reporters and spoke about the current situation in Xinjiang, saying that it is currently very stable and a harmonious atmosphere envelops the entire Xinjiang. The provincial administration has not yet made new developments because the unification and economic problems have not been fully resolved, but after the inauguration documents were sent to Ili, the general response was still good. Bao believes that the personnel from Ili will eventually return to Dihua. Also, because local products cannot be sold abroad and daily necessities are extremely scarce, the people's livelihood and economy are extremely depleted. The Sino-Soviet trade agreement that is about to be negotiated will be very beneficial to this. Both sides have agreed in principle on this trade agreement, and what remains to be discussed are technical issues. The local trade between China and the Soviet Union, which has been stagnant for four years, will become more active due to the signing of this agreement. Bao and others will return to their posts after paying respects to Director Zhang Zhizhong to report on their duties.

### Northwest Trends Have Been Finalized; Zhang Zhizhong Reiterates the Government's Sincere Efforts for Peace; Ma Hongkui Advocates Liberating Oneself

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 6th] The future trend of the Northwest has been concluded from the current affairs symposium convened by Zhang Zhizhong yesterday. After five hours of intense discussions among more than 150 legislative, supervisory committee members, national representatives, and local elders from the Northwest provinces remaining in Lanzhou, they almost unanimously sought stability, consolidation, and progress in the Northwest, so that the people of the Northwest would not suffer unnecessary sacrifices and could preserve the Northwest. At the meeting, Zhang Zhizhong reiterated the government's sincerity in seeking peace, and pointed out that judgments of success or failure cannot be made too early. The Northwest is an important part of China, and only the central government's policy should be followed. As for the future of the Northwest, it is closely related to the entire China and the world situation. The world situation is trending towards coordination, and China's peace is an urgent need for the whole people. We hope that the country will embark on a path of peace, democracy, prosperity, strength, and happiness, and we must not use the vast people as sacrifices in order to maintain the interests of one party, but rather take the interests of the entire country and people as the premise. The Northwest has special historical relations and a geographical environment. We must broaden our horizons and consider the Northwest's decisions from multiple perspectives. Protecting the Northwest is a matter for the vast people. The people rise up to support the government, and the stability and progress of the Northwest can be ensured. Ma Hongda said in his speech: The way of liberating the people touted by the Communist Party does not meet the needs of the people. Today, we should liberate ourselves and revolutionize ourselves. We must unite and work from the standpoint of the people, protect the Northwest with the power of the Northwest, and promote the progress of the country. We must ensure that the people of the Northwest do not hear the sound of gunfire, which is considered to achieve the purpose of preserving the Northwest. Wang Kaixu pointed out the anti-peace characteristics of the CCP, and demanded that wavering defeatists raise their vigilance, and emphasized that in the future, they should unite their strength with the awareness of surviving in a desperate situation, reform themselves consistently regardless of origin, religion, or ethnicity, and make all preparations to consolidate and stabilize the Northwest. Pei Jianzhun loudly called for preparing for war and seeking peace, not indulging in empty talk, and should focus on the word "preparation." The participants successively put forward concrete opinions such as developing self-defense forces and effectively strengthening military, political, economic, educational, and social measures.

[Central News Agency Dihua Dispatch, 4th] Dihua Mayor Qu Wu flew back to Dihua from Lanzhou this afternoon. According to reports, Mr. Qu was summoned by Director Zhang Zhizhong at the beginning of last winter to fly to Lanzhou and then to Beijing to participate in a certain important decision-making.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 6th] Tao Zhiyue, Bao Erhan, Hao Jiajun, and others took off from Dihua on the 5th and came to Lanzhou. Due to poor weather, they spent the night at Jiayuguan and arrived at 12:15 p.m. on the 6th. Guo Jijiao, Ma Hongda, Ma Hongbao, and dozens of other leaders went to the airport to welcome them.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 6th] Luo Lie, a member of the Xi'an Appeasement Headquarters, has completed his official business in Lanzhou and will return to Shaanxi today. Li Tiejun, Commander of the Hexi Garrison, is scheduled to fly to Guangzhou tomorrow to visit relatives.

Editorial

### Stabilizing the Lives of Public Educators!

The Shanghai Municipal Transportation Restoration and various University Professors' Associations jointly held the first meeting of the Professors' Association on February 5th. During the meeting, they discussed the issue of improving professors' compensation and decided to send a telegram to Acting President Li, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education, explaining that current professors' monthly income is only equivalent to one and a half silver dollars, and prices are still rising. They requested that immediate measures be taken to improve the situation. Additionally, they requested the issuance of three months' worth of emergency funds and grain storage funds, both based on the price index at the time of disbursement. The aforementioned telegram will be sent out within days. It is a lament from the suffering professors and a cry from public educators nationwide under the pressure of high prices. In addition to sympathizing with this painful appeal, we hope to draw the close attention of the government authorities.

Since the three years of war, prices have soared, and the people's lives are in dire straits, especially for public educators. Public educators across the country are living in hardship, with many tragic and moving stories. Almost every day, they struggle to breathe, hoping that the country will soon achieve peace and that the people's livelihoods will be restored. In these three years, the government seems to have shown some concern for public educators, but the soaring prices have quickly nullified any compensation adjustments made by the government. Currently, public educators' salaries are paid in Gold Yuan notes, calculated based on the "August 19th" base and doubled, with fifteen times the base for areas like Beijing and Shanghai. At the end of last year, due to the turbulent situation, there was a one-month salary increase, but it was merely a drop in the bucket. For months, public educators have remained in a life of hardship, with those in the Beijing-Shanghai area experiencing the most severe poverty.

University professors occupy a superior position in academia and technology. Their lives and cultivation are immersed in a spiritual environment, adhering to the fundamental values of education, fulfilling their responsibilities to the nation and their duties to education. They should not be troubled by material life, nor should they be driven by the burden of clothing, food, and children, leading to the loss of a normal life attitude and affecting their scholarship and research. If their life attitude is influenced and frustrated by objective factors, it is a loss for the country and a misfortune for education! However, the most serious fact today is that it is driving educators, like the majority of middle and lower-level civil servants, towards poverty and suffering. Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University, told our Hangzhou reporter on January 8th, "The school's finances have been in very poor condition recently, and we can't even afford to light a fire." The entire faculty and students are studying hard in the cold wind. He also said, "The average salary of a professor is only 700 Gold Yuan notes, which can only buy one dan of rice. If a professor has a wife and two children, how can they survive? And prices are likely to rise even further!" Furthermore, 278 professors at Fudan University sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education on January 14th, requesting improved compensation, saying, "Since the government's financial and price policies have changed repeatedly, Shanghai prices have soared more than 40 times in the past four months, while the salaries of our colleagues are only five times the salary amount at the time of the Taiwan dollar system reform. This meager amount is truly difficult to sustain life. Currently, our colleagues have pawned almost everything and have no way to borrow money, so we are making an urgent appeal." However, this painful appeal has not yielded any results or responses. The Minister of Education, Youth Affairs, and all of the other officials went to Guangzhou, and while the Deputy Minister remained in Shanghai, he was at a loss. When professor representatives went to see him, his answers were completely irrelevant. Such matters closely related to education are beyond the imagination of the principal officials. Today's prices have risen to 250 to 300 times the original level, and the impoverished state of ordinary public educators is even more imaginable. Can government officials still turn a blind eye?

Currently, the vast majority of educators across the country are struggling hard under the dual pressure of the aforementioned material and spiritual burdens. Their greatness and responsibility are truly moving and cannot be described by a mere journalist's pen. We deeply sympathize with the current plight of educators. However, it is not enough to rely solely on our literary sympathy. Therefore, we would like to remind the government authorities to take immediate action to adjust the compensation of public educators in order to rescue the education crisis, stabilize the lives of public educators, and even to nurture and employ talent. The appeal of the Professors' Association of Jiaotong University and Fudan University is a spark of hope burning when, as Mr. Chen Bulei said, "the oil is exhausted and the lamp is dying." The authorities should not extinguish this hope. On the contrary, they should cultivate this hope reasonably in order to achieve the goal of cultivating education and culture.

### The Price Level in the United States Generally Starts to Fall

[United States Information Service Washington 1st Dispatch] After rising continuously for ten years, the prices of world commodities are now beginning their downward trend. The prices of many basic commodities have fallen considerably, and the downward trend is gradually spreading to other commodities. The Dow Jones Futures Commodity Index published by the Wall Street Journal has indicated that world buyers believe that this downward trend will continue. This index reflects buyers' estimates of the prices of eleven important commodities in the next five months, based on future commercial transactions in the US commodity market. The recently published index is at the lowest level since mid-1947, more than 22 percent lower than the highest index in 1947.

Ordinary civilians in the United States who purchase retail goods are just beginning to notice changes in prices. Food prices seem to be decreasing, and the prices of men's and women's clothing, furniture, household appliances, furs, and other items have also decreased significantly during major sales. The prices of used cars have fallen sharply, but on the whole, the retail prices of used cars have not fallen much compared to the past, and the prices of new cars are somewhat higher. Building materials are also not much cheaper.

The most significant drop has been in the prices of raw materials. Raw material prices will eventually be reflected in the prices of goods purchased by consumers, and among raw materials, the prices of the so-called 28 "sensitive" basic commodities show the most dramatic decline. In these 28 commodities, changes in supply and demand are the fastest and most free.

The government-compiled index of this type of item was 283.07 on January 31 (August 1939 was 100), which is about 20 percent lower than the post-war high. The prices of several items are lower than the price level when the United States price controls were lifted on June 28, 1946.

The prices of rubber and silk in these 28 commodities are much lower than the price levels during past price controls. This is partly due to the competition from synthetic rubber and rayon for both rubber and silk. The prices of corn, barley, and beef and sheep fat are slightly lower than the controlled prices in June 1946, while the price of lard is slightly higher.

The prices of lard, beef and sheep fat, and silk have fallen the most sharply, 60 to 70 percent lower than the post-war peak. The prices of cottonseed oil, corn, barley, cocoa beans, and printed cloth are 40 to 60 percent lower. The prices of wheat, pigs, calves, butter, rubber, hemp, linen, resin, and hides are 23 to 33 percent lower.

The price trends have not significantly affected the prices of major metals, but the prices of scrap steel and scrap copper have fallen, and the black market (insurance prices) for steel and other products has begun to disappear.

The downward trend in raw material prices has begun to be reflected in wholesale and consumer retail prices. The government's weekly compiled wholesale price level for 900 different commodities fell to 158.8 percent of the 1926 average last week, which is the lowest level since the beginning of November 1947, and 6.5 percent lower than the post-war peak in August of the previous year.

The retail prices that families with moderate incomes in major cities have to pay have gradually decreased since April. The highest peak was created last September, when the government's monthly consumer price index reached 174.5 percent of the 1935 to 40 average. The official index on December 15 was 171.4 percent, and it is now probably 169 percent, more than 3 percent lower than the post-war high.

The reduction in household living expenses in urban areas is mainly due to the continuous decline in retail food prices and clothing prices. Rents have risen slowly, but fuel prices have decreased.

### In Hong Kong, Amidst Dense Fog, Compatriots Calmly Observe the Overall Situation; The British Have Their Own Plans

—Hong Kong 4th Air Mail Dispatch, Our Newspaper Reporter Zi Jian

The "Air-Conditioned Express Train," which once enjoyed a high reputation on the Beijing-Shanghai line, has recently been caught up in the southward migration and transferred to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, renamed the "Special Direct Express Train," shuttling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. If Guangzhou today is compared to Nanjing last year, then Hong Kong can easily be regarded as "Shanghai," a good place to spend the weekend.

Following the trend of southward migration, Hong Kong has recently seen an influx of people. A few days ago, someone published a long list in the newspaper with the title "Political Figures Spending the Spring Festival in Hong Kong." After "engaging" in activities in the mainland for many years, they are now "relieved of their burden" and sitting down quietly to see how foreigners "engage" in this place that cannot be separated from China, which is indeed a rare opportunity for reflection!

Looking back at the mainland from Hong Kong, most well-meaning compatriots are increasingly silent. They are temporarily outside the situation, and as observers, they clearly see the positive and negative forces. They certainly despise those corrupt officials who live extravagantly and dissolutely on this small island, but they also cannot help but smile when they see the "gentlemen" who usually frequent foreign high-class tea houses or write articles at home to scold people, but who, once they arrive in North China, become "democratic figures"!

Looking at Hong Kong from the mainland, one feels dizzy and confused. A guest who had recently arrived in Hong Kong said, "Hong Kong is shrouded in a dense fog." On the morning of the third day of the Spring Festival, a thick fog blew into Hong Kong, its density being the greatest in decades. The guest said that it was a good symbol of Hong Kong today.

In this city, some people commit suicide because they cannot get through the New Year, but during the Spring Festival, some people "scatter silver paper" in restaurants to please their mistresses. The wooden houses of the poor are burned down and then demolished, while the rich hold horse races and dog shows. Although London and Hong Kong are secretly discussing the implementation of a new immigration law to restrict the entry of Chinese people, 227,681 people went back and forth by plane alone last year. In addition to the newly established direct express train mentioned above, new aluminum passenger ships custom-made by the Minsheng Company from Canada have also joined the Guangzhou-Hong Kong line. The four small ferries that travel between Hong Kong and Kowloon received a net profit of 1.6 million yuan last year. In a recent interesting statistical figure released by the Hong Kong government, the amount of feces "pulled" by Hong Kong citizens each month has exceeded 50,000 tons!

Although the voice of peace is sung loudly in China and even internationally, Hong Kong has actually announced the organization of a defense force. Recruitment began and was immediately full. Each soldier can receive a net salary of 80 yuan per month. British members of Parliament traveled a long way from London to Hong Kong. The first thing they said was: "Members of all parties in the British Parliament unanimously believe that we are determined to defend Hong Kong." Celebrities from China and abroad in Hong Kong launched an "Hong Kong Promotion Association" to broadcast the public opinion that "Hong Kong people do not want to return Hong Kong to China." Basil, the Assistant Under-Secretary of the British Colonial Office, said at a press conference: "If the Chinese Communists are sensible, they will also feel that maintaining the stability of Hong Kong is beneficial to China and to them." He also said: Britain will do its best to protect Hong Kong from the current turmoil in the Far East.

Brigadier General Philran, the former British Military Attaché to the Chinese Embassy who had been transferred from Hong Kong to London to take up a new position, put it more clearly. He said, "The future of Hong Kong depends on the Communists' own decisions. They will not be so foolish as to ignore such a prosperous colony. If it is under Soviet control, I doubt whether foreign trade will be affected. The Soviet Union and China are not enough to satisfy each other's needs and still rely on supplies from the outside world." For this reason, British shipping companies in Hong Kong are actively trying to restore shipping between Hong Kong and Tianjin, and shipping between Hong Kong and North Korea has already been underway for some time.

Although the Hong Kong market was not doing well last year, according to the statistics of the Import and Export Department, the total value of imports last year was 2,077,538,615 yuan, and the total value of exports was 1,582,739,710 yuan. The total value of imports and exports increased by 32.23% compared to 1947. According to financial sources, by the end of last year, the amount of Hong Kong dollars issued had reached 900 million yuan, an increase of 20% compared to a year ago, and about 25% of it was circulating within Guangdong Province. Hong Kong has become the largest concentration point of Chinese wealth today, and the power of Hong Kong currency is enough to influence the economy of South China.

Although Hong Kong today seems to be shrouded in a dense fog, a general outline can be vaguely seen from a political and economic perspective. Regardless of how significant changes occur in the situation in China, the London authorities will not easily give up this "vested interest." But whether the British can use this "Far East democratic showcase" as the cornerstone of the permanent friendship between the two great nations of China and Britain, and the pillar of peace in the Pacific, remains to be proven by facts.

### Soviet Union Suggests to the Norwegian Government Establishing a Non-Aggression Treaty Aimed at Preventing Norway from Joining the Atlantic Alliance

[United Press London, 5th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 5th: The Soviet Union has formally suggested to Norway the establishment of a non-aggression treaty "to eliminate any doubts about Soviet intentions." The broadcast stated that the Soviet ambassador to Norway, Afanasiev, has submitted this note to the Norwegian government. This Soviet note is in response to Norway's statement regarding its attitude towards the North Atlantic Treaty. Moscow Radio stated that the Soviet note explained that Western alliance countries hope to pull Norway into the Atlantic Treaty to establish military bases on its territory. The note continued, "This is of utmost importance to the Soviet Union because the two countries, the Soviet Union and Norway, are geographically adjacent and share a common defense line." The broadcast stated that the Soviet ambassador to Norway met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange on the 5th to present the note. He also informed Lange: "The Norwegian government clearly understands that the Soviet Union has always maintained a friendly attitude towards Norway, but if the Norwegian government still doubts the Soviet Union's good neighborly intentions towards Norway, the Soviet government, in order to eliminate any doubts about Soviet intentions, is willing to suggest to the Norwegian government the establishment of a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union." The Soviet note stated that the Norwegian government's declaration that it would not allow any country to use its military bases unless Norway is attacked or threatened with attack is clearly "insufficient." The note continued, "The above statement shows that at any time, including the current peaceful period, Norway may use rumors or premeditated false evidence to supply foreign countries with military bases." The Soviet note also stated that the Soviet Union cannot agree with the Norwegian government's view that the North Atlantic Treaty conforms to the section on establishing regional alliances in the United Nations Charter. The note stated, "Obviously, the initiators of the Atlantic Alliance are relying on this argument, but no one can conceal the fact that the Atlantic Alliance is in fact established outside the scope of the United Nations and is being used by certain countries for aggressive policies."

### Military Analyst Huie Claims The US is Equipping New Armies in Japan and Germany Training Could Be Completed Before the End of the Year

[United Press Washington, 5th] A military analyst claimed on the 5th that the Japanese and German armies under British and American control could be established by the end of this year. In an article in the February issue of a business magazine, Huie stated that a new Japanese army under American control will emerge before the end of 1949. Huie also stated that the revival of a German army under British and American control is "highly possible." Huie's report stated that US military aid has equipped thirty "non-demobilized armies on earth" through "various means." Millions of dollars have been used to train and equip these armies.

He said that whether to spend "several hundred million more is the main point of contention in the 81st Congress." He also said that the proposed cost of establishing a French army is one billion dollars, which means that another five billion will be needed later. He said that Japan's burden on American taxpayers is one billion, and Germany will also continue to need one billion. He said that military aid includes not only direct supply of cash and equipment, but also indirect consultants and training.

### Royal Flies Back to Tokyo Today Flies to Korea

Claims to Know Nothing About Huie's Comments

[United Press Kyoto, 6th] US Secretary of the Army Royal told United Press here on the 6th that he had no knowledge of the plan predicted by military analyst Huie in an article in the February issue of the National Business Magazine that Japanese and German armies would be re-established under the control of the United States and Britain.

### Iranian Left-Wing Tudeh Party Declared Illegal

Assassin of the Iranian King Dies from Severe Wounds

[United Press Tehran, 5th] After the assassination attempt on the King of Iran, public sentiment was outraged, and the left-wing Tudeh Party clubs in Tehran were destroyed by the public.

### Two Soviet Divisions Arrive in Germany Berlin Cold War Intensifies

[United Press Berlin, 6th] The tension of the Berlin Cold War reached a new climax last night. Soviet-approved newspapers hinted that if the United States and Britain intensify the counter-blockade, the Soviet Union will take retaliatory measures. German workers and police have dug trenches at key road junctions to support the order prohibiting West German cars from entering East Germany. Currently, the only connection between Berlin and West Germany is by telegram, apart from air transport. It is also learned that two more Soviet divisions have arrived in Germany, bringing the total number of troops to 230,000.

### US Rejects Soviet Peace Proposal Pravda Criticizes

[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 6th] Pravda published an editorial this morning entitled "Why Does the United States Reject a Peace Treaty," stating that the US leadership's opposition to a peace treaty represents a policy of aggression and international adventurism. Pravda, after mentioning Stalin's recent statement to the press, continued, "No one can deny that Stalin's plan can create an opportunity not only to resolve US-Soviet relations, but also to strengthen world peace and international security." The Soviet Union's declaration that it is ready to sign a permanent peace treaty between the US and the Soviet Union and to resolve the Berlin issue stems from the Soviet Union's will to strengthen peace and international security. But we now know that the United States has taken measures to oppose all of the Soviet Union's proposed measures. The significance of the United States' refusal to sign a peace treaty with the Soviet Union is nothing more than the fact that the ideals and intentions of this treaty are fundamentally contrary to the general line, nature, and principles of the international policies of the US leadership. The purpose of this policy of the United States is to create aggressive blocs supported by the United States, promote an arms race, revert to the traditional anti-Soviet policy of the past, and complete the well-known strategic plan of isolating and encircling the Soviet Union. The editorial continued that there are now two absolutely contradictory concepts prevalent in international relations regarding the ideals of a peace treaty, one aimed at strengthening peace and international security, and the other aimed at severing all peaceful international cooperation and continuing to undermine relations between the US and the Soviet Union. The newspaper concluded that the Soviet Union will resolutely fight to the end against all warmongers in order to seek permanent democratic peace.

### Serious Crisis Within the Greek Communist Party Confirmation of Marcos' Dismissal Greek Government Urges Guerrillas to Lay Down Their Arms

[Agence France-Presse Athens, 5th] Greek Security Minister Rendis said today in a military meeting presided over by King Paul, "Any change in government in totalitarian countries implies a serious internal crisis, and those who are dismissed will disappear from the political stage forever."

### The Endowment of War Excessive Number of Women Grotesque Marriage Advertisements

[United Press Frankfurt, 5th] The "man shortage" in post-war Germany is becoming increasingly apparent. The national ratio of men to women is now one to two. Young women often boldly post "Seeking Boyfriend" advertisements on public billboards. The content is mostly: "Ms. So-and-so, 22 years old, blonde hair, fair skin, blue eyes, medium build, willing to make friends with wealthy businessmen and spend weekends together." Or: "Single woman, 25 years old, beautiful face, healthy physique, willing to make friends with men under 30 to pass the night, apartment room provided." Love advertisements are a new invention, but the spread is like wildfire, and the wording is naked, most of which do not mention marriage.

### Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiqing Talk Encourage Industry and Commerce Not to Drift With the Tide Stabilize Prices

Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Industrial Association, and Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement yesterday, urging industry and commerce to increase production and stabilize prices. It roughly stated: Since the opening of the market after the Spring Festival, due to the influx of hot money, various prices have risen accordingly, and the speed and height of the rise have been unexpected. The rise in daily necessities is particularly severe, which seriously threatens the lives of civilians. Currently, the authorities are actively planning to channel hot money, and the sale of yarn has also been implemented. If the currency can have a considerable destination, prices will naturally stabilize. Our colleagues in industry and commerce are responsible for increasing production and trading in goods, and we hope that each will do their best in their respective positions, striving to increase manufacturing on the one hand and supply demand on the other, so that materials are abundant and prices are stable. The costing and pricing should be based on the standard of being sufficient for re-production and replacement. Do not drift with the tide and pursue excessive profits. Stabilizing the market is also stabilizing people's hearts.

Since then, prices have fluctuated sharply. Recently, coal prices have been adjusted daily, and oil prices have also been adjusted every other day. Compared with January 26, on February 5, the price of coal per ton increased from 4,896 yuan to 13,452 yuan, and the price of fuel oil per ton increased from 8,948 yuan to 28,350 yuan, both increasing by more than two times.

The total cost of navigation has increased by 170%. And prices are still fluctuating daily and rising crazily, changing from morning to evening, so it is impossible to calculate costs.

### Hotel Room Rates Calculated According to Index Can No Longer Maintain Costs; Industry Decides to Send Representatives to Petition the City Government Today

The price of hotel room rentals was previously decided by the Social Affairs Bureau's Hotel Rental Evaluation Committee to be increased by 190 times based on the "August 19th" base. Recently, the Municipal Council decided to calculate according to the cost of living index. Upon hearing this news, the industry association convened a general meeting of all members yesterday to discuss this issue. The association believes that the average increase in the cost of essential items for the industry, such as public utilities, rice, oil, cloth, laundry, and newsprint, has already increased by more than 340 times compared to "August 19th." If calculated at 190 times, it will not be possible to maintain costs, and if fees are charged according to the cost of living index, it will be even more impossible to sustain. Therefore, it has been decided to send representatives to the city government this morning to petition, stating the difficulties of the industry and requesting that the city government continue to follow the previously approved method, with the council assessing the prices, or allow the association to negotiate prices based on costs. If they still align with the cost of living index, they hope that the costs paid by the hotels will also be paid according to the cost of living index multiplier to maintain the survival of the hotel industry and the livelihoods of thousands of employees.

Police Machinery Wins Against Postal and Telecommunications

Next was the Group B second-division match between the Postal and Telecommunications Team and the Police Machinery Team. The former was the champion of Liangxi, but they played loosely last night, and the baskets on the court were not in good condition. The Police Machinery Team, whom they faced, had plenty of power, so they lost 23 to 41. After the opening, Police Machinery's Huang Ke-gen committed a foul. Dai Yao-zhang made one of two free throws, opening the scoring for the Postal and Telecommunications Team. Tong Ji also scored. The Police Machinery Team tied the score at 3 each.

### Railway Football Team Competition Dispute: Two-Road Sports Association Issues Statement

Regarding the scene of the Railway versus Longtou football league game last week, which almost resulted in an unpleasant outcome due to spectators "making a scene," the Football Committee held a meeting and believed that the Railway team left the field halfway, and although they continued the game later, it was against the spirit of sportsmanship. It was decided to replay the game, and the players were also punished separately. The Two-Road Employees' Sports Association issued the following statement yesterday regarding this dispute:

(1) The cause was a penalty kick in the second half, which was said to be because the team's defender "tripped" the Longtou forward in the penalty area. In fact, the ball had already been caught and kicked out by the team's goalkeeper. The Longtou forward intentionally collided with the team's goalkeeper beforehand. The defender legally defended and did not "hit" or "trip." At that time, the referee was far in the middle line and did not see clearly, which was obviously a misunderstanding.

(2) Since a penalty kick was awarded, a Longtou player was standing inside the penalty area line (contrary to the newspaper report that Railway players were standing inside the line). According to the rules, how should it be handled? The referee had no opinion at all. When asked the linesman, one advocated "severe penalty" and the other advocated "out of bounds." While hesitating and indecisive, another penalty was awarded. The team's players were dissatisfied with the referee's repeated mistakes and lack of opinion. Xu and Yue took a break by the side of the field. The audience thought that the team was "striking," and the dispute arose.

(3) At that time, the team captain was making an oral protest to the referee, and the team's players did not all leave the field. The audience misunderstood and made a lot of noise. The game was interrupted once. This responsibility should not be borne by the team.

### Group C Football Finals: Public Transport and Firefly Win

The two matches of the Group C Football League finals were also held at Yiyuan Stadium, starting at 9 a.m. After competing, Public Transport defeated Yong'an by a score of 6 to 0. Subsequently, Firefly faced Jizhi. The strength of the two teams was about the same, and they fought fiercely. At the end of the game, the score was tied at 1 to 1, and no winner was determined. According to regulations, overtime was extended by 20 minutes. Firefly relied on their final efforts and scored another goal, winning 2 to 1. Public Transport and Firefly both won the finals.

### China National Aviation Corporation Starts Strong but Fades; Jingwu Turns Defeat into Victory; Yiyuan Football Match Result: 4 to 3

In the Group A football match, Jingwu and China National Aviation Corporation met at Yiyuan Stadium. The weather was extremely cold, and there were few spectators. Both sides lacked excitement. China National Aviation Corporation started strong but faded. They won three goals in the first half. Jingwu showed great promise in the second half. Wu Jing-ren pulled off a hat trick, scoring four goals alone, turning defeat into victory.

China National Aviation Corporation took the offensive first. Li Shun-sheng pressed hard and shot into the chaos, scoring the first goal. Not long after, Zheng Si-min passed to the front of the goal. Li Shun-sheng hit the upper right corner. Gao Zhi-wen watched helplessly, making it 2 to 0. After that, the stalemate continued until the 28th minute. Xu Zu-guo took the ball deep and approached the goal, gently flicking it. Gao Zhi-wen turned over and tried to save it, but it rolled into the net. The first half ended with China National Aviation Corporation winning three goals.

After the break, Jingwu's offense was strong. As soon as the battle resumed, Fang Ren-qiu cut in and knocked on the door. Wang Guo-guang failed to save. Wu Jing-ren flew up and shoveled it in, pulling back a city. Not long after, Fang Ren-qiu passed again, Wu Jing-ren tapped his strength and shot, bouncing off Wang Guo-guang's body and into the goal, cutting another pass. After 16 minutes, Liang Min-tao passed, and Wu Jing-ren shot, breaking through another city, tying the game. China National Aviation Corporation saw that the situation was not good and used veteran Fu Zhi-bin, replacing Zheng Si-min. Gao Xiu-qing carelessly twisted her ankle and staggered. Not long after, Xu Zu-guo was also injured and left the field. Jingwu's Wu Jing-ren received support, broke through and knocked on the door, taking another city. With four goals to three, Jingwu turned defeat into victory.

### Wuxi Love Suicide Case: Murderer Zhang Ji-ming May Be Executed

[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 5th] After being arrested by the Investigation Team in Shanghai and escorted back to Wuxi, the love suicide case murderer Zhang Ji-ming was interrogated overnight by the Military Law Office. However, in order to shirk his responsibility, Zhang's confession was very cunning, covering up his words everywhere. He even raised counter-questions to the witnesses' confessions when there were slight flaws. After several days of exhausting interrogation, Zhang finally bowed his head and said nothing. Yesterday at noon, he was escorted by the team to the City Defense Headquarters for legal proceedings.

Killed Mistress

Denies Vehemently

According to Zhang Ji-ming's confession: also known as Nv-chang, from Liling, Hunan, 34 years old. Graduated from the 10th Infantry Class of the Central Military Academy at the age of 25. He served as platoon leader of the 19th Division, company commander of the Special Service Company of the Fourth War Zone Headquarters, battalion commander of the 107th Division, company commander of the Heavy Artillery Machine Gun Company, and Lieutenant Colonel Instructor of the Guizhou Military Control Zone Headquarters. He vehemently denies the case of shooting his mistress Kun-ling Zhang Yu-yan and her husband. He also said that he felt very sorry for Yu-yan's life experience. His help to her was purely out of compassion, with no ambiguous elements. Later, the Military Judge Wang Yu-wu ordered the tea room waiter Xu A-rong from the Dongxin Inn and the girl Zhang Da-hei, who was also in the room at the time of the incident, to be brought to the scene to identify him. The victim's father, Zhang Yu-ting, also said: "Zhang committed pursued Yu-yan. The first physical relationship occurred at the Yongan Hotel in Nanjing." The presiding judge then said to Zhang committed: "The evidence is solid. Think again. The cash cow on which the whole family of Yu-ting depends has been completely sent away by you. Can you get through with your conscience?" After listening, Zhang was slightly touched. After a while, he said, "They were definitely not killed by me, but because I am the most suspected, I am willing to die."

Cunning Scheme

Exhausting Interrogation

Because the Military Law Office could not get to the point, they began exhausting interrogation. Zhang committed even said to the judge: "The law is very powerful. I can't make trouble for myself in my confession." The judge retorted: "Do you think that if you don't admit the case, the law will be helpless against you?" Zhang committed smiled without answering at the time. According to the interrogation process released by Military Judge Wang, Zhang Ji-ming is a soldier, but he has been infected with strong vulgar habits. He is involved in eating, dressing, prostitution, and gambling. Therefore, he is very experienced in the world. He may even have done interrogation work. Therefore, he uses his own cleverness and experience in his confessions before and after the occurrence of this case. This is definitely not the method of an ordinary soldier. In the end, the military judge often used sharp eyes to stare at the face of the prisoner, forcing Zhang to bow his head with righteousness, showing weakness, to the point of stammering and having to confess the truth, admitting all the crimes.

Extreme Penalty

Very Possible

Recently, within and outside the city, in places such as Dongchengjiao, Shafuning, Dongxin Road, and Huishan, blood cases have occurred continuously. Commander Liu of the City Defense Department called the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters to ask for instructions on how to handle Xiao Shi-yang, a soldier of a certain unit who beat to death a firewood owner, and Zhang Ji-ming, the perpetrator of this case. Commander-in-chief Tang Enbo immediately instructed Liu to handle it in accordance with military law and authorized him to execute them on the spot. He also expressed great concern about the local public order, saying that anyone who disrupts public order or spreads rumors to confuse the public can be arrested and shot on the spot. It is reported that Commander Liu has decided to comply with the order, so the two perpetrators, Xiao and Zhang, can be sentenced in the short term, and they are likely to be sentenced to extreme penalty.
