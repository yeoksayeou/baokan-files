### The Two Peace Delegations from Nanjing and Shanghai Will Fly to Beiping Tomorrow

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 4th] The Nanjing People's Peace Delegation was still unable to depart on the 4th. A representative of the delegation told reporters: This morning, we spoke with Ye Jianying in Beiping, who informed us of the following points: (1) The plane will take off at 2:00 PM on the 6th to come to Beiping. (2) We will communicate by telephone at 9:00 AM that morning. (3) Reporters need not come, as all news agencies here have reporters. (4) The plane will land at Nanyuan Airport. According to sources from the China National Aviation Corporation here, CNAC has designated Yin Huaxi, not Ao Shipeng, as the person in charge in Beiping. The Beiping telephone said that the company's telegram was already sealed and cannot be contacted. If this difficulty cannot be resolved, it is impossible to risk flying. It has now been reported to the head office for instructions.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 4th] Wu Yu-hou, a representative of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, spoke with the Communist Party's Ye Jianying on the morning of the 4th for half an hour through private channels. He learned that Beiping was not prepared to welcome them in time, and the airport's communication equipment had not yet been repaired, making it impossible to land on the 4th.

[City News] China National Aviation Corporation has decided to send a special plane to Qingdao on the 6th to carry the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation to Beiping.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, and others from the Peace Delegation are scheduled to fly to Beiping from Shanghai on the 6th. Gan Jiehou, the personal representative of Acting President Li, and Shao Lizi have also decided to go. Mr. Gan returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 4th and immediately went to see Acting President Li to report. Around 11:00 AM, he visited Shao Lizi again to discuss matters concerning going to Beiping, and returned to Shanghai by plane at 12:30 PM. According to sources close to Acting President Li, Yan, Zhang, and others' visit to Beiping has received a response from Beiping on a personal level. In addition to meeting with Ye Jianying and others, they will also travel to other regions based on developments in Beiping to meet with Communist Party leader Mao Zedong and others, convey the government's sincerity in seeking peace, and knock on the door of peace.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Shao Lizi said on the evening of the 4th that he agreed to go to Beiping with Yan and others, but this trip does not represent the government and is only in the capacity of a personal representative. He is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 6th to wait for the plane to go together.

Shanghai Delegation Members Can Be Fully Decided Today

[Our Dispatch] The members of the Shanghai Peace Delegation need to be rearranged due to environmental and personal intentions. In addition to Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, who have decided to fly to Beiping to conduct peace explorations, Leng Yuqiu is unable to spare time due to the upcoming session of the Provincial Assembly. Another representative, Chen Guangfu, a financial magnate in the city, also recently expressed no intention of going north. According to sources close to Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen has devoted his life to the financial industry and has always lacked interest in politics. Therefore, when Acting President Li came to Shanghai to personally invite him, he politely declined. As for the consultations in recent days, although Mr. Chen attended by invitation, it was only for the nature of friendly exchanges of opinions. Due to the changes in the members of the Peace Delegation, the date of departure for the north must be delayed by a day or two to look for new candidates in Shanghai. Gan Jiehou flew to Nanjing at 7:20 AM yesterday morning to see Acting President Li for instructions, and then flew back to Shanghai at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to contact all parties again regarding the members of the delegation. He had not returned to the hotel late at night. It is heard that the government is quite interested in inviting Liu Hongsheng to serve as a representative to fill the vacancy of Chen Guangfu. It is expected that the new candidates can be fully decided today. In addition to the five representatives, Shao Lizi will go to Beiping on the same plane to strive to directly negotiate with the Communist Party representatives and explore the true attitude of the Communist Party. It is uncertain whether Mr. Gan Jiehou will accompany him because he still has tasks in Shanghai.

### Cheng Siyuan Arrives in Taipei to Represent Acting President Li in Visiting Chen Cheng, Seeking Opinions on the Current Situation, and Explaining Zhang Xueliang's Motives

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 4th] Legislator Cheng Siyuan arrived in Taipei by B-25 military plane at around 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. This trip was on behalf of Acting President Li and at the invitation of Chairman Chen to visit Taiwan. Mr. Cheng met with reporters at the Hubei Reception Center and said: This trip was under the instructions of Acting President Li, requesting him to seek Chairman Chen's opinions on the current situation and the reform of politics and economy. Acting President Li believes that at this time of crisis, it is imperative for the central government and local governments to unite as one. Regarding the Zhang Xueliang issue, Mr. Cheng said: In addition to the central government's release order, Acting President Li has a private telegram to Chairman Chen, and this time he will explain to Mr. Chen the motives and causes of this move by the central government. Regarding the peace issue, the central government is making its utmost efforts. Huang Qihan was sent to Beiping with a letter, but no progress has been made so far. Acting President Li is also trying to establish contact with Li Jishen, but personnel were sent to visit him, but he was nowhere to be found. At the moment, the central government's policy is to seek peace, but if peace cannot be achieved, it will never surrender, hoping that national public opinion can exert its strength to urge the Communist Party to eliminate prejudices. Mr. Cheng finally mentioned the US attitude, saying that Yu Bin met with President Truman in the United States and telegraphed Mr. Wu, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, with Mr. Truman's opinion. Mr. Truman believes that the United States must support China's peace, but if peace is not attainable, the government still has the vast land south of the Yangtze River, and the United States will continue to assist the government until peace is achieved. Mr. Cheng will stay in Taiwan for about three to five days, and will meet with Chairman Chen tonight. It is also learned that Mr. Cheng also carries private letters to Weng Wenhao and Sun Lianzhong, hoping that the two will return to Nanjing as soon as possible.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Legislator Cheng Siyuan, under the order of Acting President Li, flew to Taiwan by plane at around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 4th to represent Acting President Li in visiting Chen Cheng for discussions and will also visit Zhang Xueliang.

### Economic Cooperation Administration Decides to Stop Relief Work in Communist Areas

Larkin Inspects Keelung Port Wharf

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] According to authoritative sources, the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) has been carrying out activities in the Communist-controlled areas of China in the past. Now the US has decided to stop economic relief for civilians in Communist areas. It is said that the ECA and the State Department recently jointly drafted a plan to continue to provide relief to the National Government areas that have recently been ravaged by the Communist Party, but senior US government officials have flatly rejected this proposal. ECA officials had expected the CCP to "cooperate" with the ECA to implement the civilian relief plan, but the US government, upon learning that the CCP had seized flour, cotton, and other economic cooperation materials in Tianjin, felt compelled to abandon this plan. If Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are also controlled by the Communist Party, the relief plans in those places will also be cancelled. In addition, Congress had originally planned to hear opinions on aid to China this month, but it has now decided to postpone it pending further developments in our country's political and military situation.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 4th] Larkin and his party arrived in Taiwan on the 3rd for inspection. On the 4th, they visited the Taipei Railway Factory and then went to Keelung to visit the wharf, shipyard, and fertilizer plant. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Yan Jiagan and You Mijian. They took a fast train to Taichung at night to visit the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant. The China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration has decided to add an office in Taipei. More than 25 foreign technicians from its industrial construction team will come to Taiwan from Shanghai. They have already arrived in Taiwan to conduct inspections. Chieschel, the American planning engineer of the Taiwan Railway, has been very busy in recent days. It is said that his investigation report can be completed before March 1st. The US$1.5 million in US aid allocated to the Taiwan Railway Bureau will be allocated after Chieschel's investigation report is sent to the US Economic Cooperation Administration for approval.

### Telecommunications Between Beijing and Nanjing Still Open

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] It is learned that the telegraph and telephone communication circuits between the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau and the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau are still open.

### Liu Anqi Talks to Foreign Reporters: Qingdao National Army Will Not Withdraw; No Local Agreements Ever Planned

[Gourlay, China Branch Director, United Press, Qingdao, 4th] General Liu Anqi, the last commander in North China who can command the National Army that has not surrendered or been surrounded, told United Press on the 4th that the Communist Army will not immediately attack Qingdao. However, he also warned that once the Communist leaders give the order, the 300,000 Communist troops around Qingdao may launch a general offensive.

Liu also said: "I don't believe there will be any major changes in Qingdao in two weeks. All the rumors here are not credible." He agreed with Li Daifang, Chairman of the Qingdao Municipal Council, that neither the Nationalists nor the Communists currently have any reason to fight in Qingdao and destroy the city. Liu said that he and the troops under his command still accept orders from the Nanjing government. He also said that he has not engaged in or planned to emulate Fu Zuoyi of Beiping and conclude local agreements to end the war and hand over the city to the Communists. He has also been ordered to defend Qingdao in the event of a Communist attack, but he believes that there is no reason to involve Qingdao in the civil war massacre before it is attacked.

Liu also said that the claim that the US Western Pacific Fleet headquarters' departure from Qingdao would be a signal for the Communist Army to attack Qingdao is not credible. Liu estimates that the Communist Army, which is deployed in an arc of 20 to 40 miles on the west, north, and east sides of Qingdao, has about 300,000 troops, of which 200,000 are regular troops and 100,000 are militia. He declined to disclose the total number of National Army troops in Qingdao, but reliable sources estimate that it is currently around 70,000.

Liu also denounced the rumors that the National Army is planning to gradually withdraw from Qingdao by sea as groundless. According to the news, the country will completely withdraw before February 15, pending the peaceful takeover by the Communist Army. That day is the second or third day after the US Western Pacific Fleet headquarters leaves here. It is reported that Lieutenant General Badger announced that his headquarters is scheduled to leave here on the flagship USS Eldorado in the next ten to twelve days.

### Major Communist Forces in Southern Henan Retreat Northward; Nationalist Troops and Local Forces Recapture Huangkouchuan; Order Fully Restored in Pukou and Puzhen

[Our Correspondent in Xinyang, 4th] Military news: Communist forces in southern Henan began a major retreat north through Suiping on the 2nd. Their movements are unclear. Currently, there is no trace of bandits within 30 li of Zhumadian and Queshan. Another report: Nationalist troops in southern Henan, together with local forces, recaptured Huangchuan, east of the Ping-Han Railway, on the 4th. The Ninth District Commissioner's Office and the Huangchuan County Government have returned to the county seat with the troops to resume work. Additionally, local communists who attacked Guangshan also fled back through Fu and Gushi on the 5th.

[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 4th] It is widely rumored here that Communist forces in Xuchang and Zhengzhou have successively begun retreating north. However, according to the spokesman of the剿匪 General Headquarters, this has not yet been confirmed. Another report from the Ping-Han Railway: Communist forces in Xuchang do indeed appear to be moving northward.

[Our Correspondent in Puzhen, 4th] With the main Communist forces far north of Jiashan and the Nationalist and Communist forces in a stalemate near Wuyi since the Spring Festival, order has been fully restored in both the Puzhen and Pukou areas. The majority of residents who fled to the south of the Yangtze River in the past have now returned, and are living and working in peace.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] It is reported that there are currently over 600 local Communist troops from the Southeast Detachment of the Jianghuai Military Region stationed inside Liuhe City, over 300 stationed in Guabu Town south of Liuhe, and over 700 stationed near Dahekou on the Yangtze River southeast of Liuhe. They have been forcibly requisitioning so-called "firewood" and public grain from the people in recent days. Furthermore, on the Yangzhou front, Nationalist and Communist forces are still facing each other on the line of Sancha River and Shijia Bridge south of the city. There are over 400 local Communist troops stationed in Yangzhou under the command of Communist county magistrate Gu Weiheng.

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 4th] There is no fighting on the Yangzhou-Liuhe line. Nationalist and Communist forces remain in a standoff in Shijia Bridge. The ports of Kouan, Sanjiangying, Guazhou, Shierxu, and Yiwei are still in Nationalist hands. Since the resumption of regular Zhenjiang-Guazhou, Zhenjiang-Shierxu, and Zhenjiang-Sizhou ferry services on the 3rd, there have been more people crossing the river to the north than coming south in recent days. The congestion at the riverside has eased slightly compared to before. The defense of Zhenjiang City has been taken over by the Fourth Army under Wang Zuohua. It is also learned that the situation in Nantong is unclear. The telegraph office here has been unable to contact the area.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 4th] Pro-government sources stated on the 4th that the Communist pressure on Nanjing has temporarily eased. Nationalist troops have reoccupied Nantong. Foreign observers believe that the Communist withdrawal from positions threatening Nationalist bridgehead fortresses along the north bank of the Yangtze River is a "major reorganization before an offensive."

[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] There was no military activity in the Nanjing area today. Government forces apparently continue to avoid contact with Communist forces. Most Communist activity is of a local nature, as the main force of Chen Yi's troops is resting and reorganizing north of the river. The entire Ministry of National Defense appears to have left Nanjing, with military activity completely in the hands of Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison. It is rumored that Zhou Zhirou and others will also go to South China within days.

Normal Transportation Between the Capital and Liangpu; Driving Order Restored at Xia-Guan Station

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] This morning, a reporter visited Pukou and Puzhen, bridgeheads across the Yangtze River. In addition to soldiers, most of the passengers on the ferries were peddlers, and those who had just crossed north were mostly refugees hurrying to visit their old homes north of the river. Tranquility reigned between the two ports, with passage unimpeded. The only sign of wartime was the soldiers strengthening fortifications. Villagers still lived in their homes in a leisurely manner, enjoying the beautiful spring days. The reporter then returned to Xiaguan and visited the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Station. Traffic order has been restored, and all trains to and from the station arrive and depart on time. The congestion caused by the evacuation before the Lunar New Year, as well as the boxes and baggage that filled the platforms, have disappeared. However, most of the passengers are still single peddlers, carrying and shouldering foreign goods or goods such as lard and chicken eggs. However, they are no longer as extravagant as they were before the New Year, only buying third-class tickets to save costs, so the first and second-class carriages are not as crowded as before. Xiaguan and the city are also smoothly connected by the resumed bus service on the two public bus routes between the southern capital and the city. Therefore, except for a slight decrease in population, the general situation in Nanjing is normal.

Editorial

### Hurry to Suppress Prices!

Since the reopening of the market after the New Year holiday, prices in Shanghai have been like a wild horse that has thrown off its reins, galloping and jumping wildly, almost impossible to control. Although this round of price increases was led by financial commodities such as gold, US dollars, and silver dollars on the black market, the most violent increases, with the highest multiples, were in daily necessities for the people's livelihood. Especially the price of rice, which has risen too shockingly! Before the Spring Festival, the selling price of rice was only around 1,500 yuan, but by the day before yesterday, the rice market had risen to six levels, with retail prices in the market all above 6,000 yuan. The price of rice rose more than four times in just five or six days, how could the general public and salaried class not turn pale at the news? Whether out of concern for the hardships of the people's livelihood or to ensure local security, the central and municipal authorities cannot stand idly by in the face of the soaring rice prices!

Most shamefully, government officials are only being overwhelmed by the voices of peace, begging to burn, begging for mercy, and relocating, but they have forgotten the major things that should be done quickly right in front of them. Prices are rising so wildly, but the authorities seem to be unmoved. In the past, the central government would often be busy and flustered over the issue of prices, but at present, their hands and feet are not moving for the sake of prices, but are only busy with moving and evacuating, as if the lives of millions of ordinary people are not as important as their own lives. One moment they are clamoring to sell goods, and the next moment they are not selling them. We really don't understand what these meat-eaters are doing!

According to reports, Mayor Wu was quite angered by the soaring rice prices and ordered the rice industry officials to cancel all rice transactions in the northern and southern rice markets and strictly stipulated that the price of white glutinous rice in the market should not exceed 4,500 yuan per dan, and the price of each dou sold at the door should not exceed 480 yuan. At the same time, citizens were restricted from buying rice with their identity cards, limited to five sheng at a time. It is understandable that Mayor Wu took such emergency measures, but whether the measures can be effective is still a serious question. Yesterday, the rice market was still not open, and rice shops were in a state of semi-paralysis. This serious problem of people's food has still not been resolved, making people from all walks of life feel the threat of this "white rice terror."

We analyze the causes of this round of soaring prices from a purely academic point of view, which are nothing more than the following three factors: First, the situation is turbulent and unstable. With the north-south transportation already blocked, the economic zones are inevitably divided. The gold yuan notes in the north fell into the hands of the Communists at once, and through the merchants, they came southward like a landslide, instantly flooding the Shanghai market with hot money. With the capital preparing to move the government to Guangzhou, personnel from various ministries and commissions gathered in Shanghai, preparing to go south, and the hot money in Nanjing also flowed to Shanghai. Guangdong and Hunan provinces have also proposed issuing local currencies, further reducing the credit of the gold yuan in the eyes of the Shanghai people, who have always valued things over currency. Furthermore, considering Shanghai itself, peace? War? No one dares to make a definitive judgment, which makes people even more restless. Reflected in the financial market, it is like adding fuel to the fire, making the price increases unstoppable.

Second, the amount of gold yuan notes issued has increased sharply. At the beginning of the currency system reform implemented in August last year, the whole country, both government and people, hoped that after the currency system reform, there would be no more indiscriminate issuance of currency, and that the gold yuan notes, which were worth 3 million to one, would not become the reformed legal tender after a certain period of time. Therefore, they unanimously advocated strengthening the responsibilities of the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Preparation Committee and publishing the amount of gold yuan notes issued and their preparation on a monthly basis to show great trust. However, after only a few months, the committee became a mere formality and eventually died of 麻痲 (a kind of disease). Up to now, no one knows exactly how many gold yuan notes have been issued. But judging by common sense, the accumulated total amount of gold yuan notes issued at present is considerable. Apart from other things, the large increase in military and government expenses around the Spring Festival alone is quite large. At the same time, the area in which the gold yuan notes circulate is gradually shrinking. Tianjin is no longer circulating, and they are flowing south one after another. Shanghai, which is the first to bear the brunt, has become a refuge for hot money. In this way, how can prices not skyrocket?

Third, the government has not taken any countermeasures against the surging hot money. The authorities had already anticipated that prices would inevitably rise after the Spring Festival, and even declared that on the day the market reopened after the New Year, they would use the method of selling goods to tighten the money supply so that prices would not rise wildly. At first, all industries were apprehensive, and the opening price was not too high. However, by noon, the industries did not see the government take any practical action to sell goods, so prices rose in a frenzy, creating this unprecedented surge.

As mentioned above, the first factor, the turbulent and unstable situation, caused this round of soaring prices, which is not something that the authorities can reverse. However, the authorities have a large number of goods, saying they will sell them but not selling them, allowing hot money to flood Shanghai, causing prices to rise several times a day. In the eyes of our people, no matter how the responsible authorities explain it, they are ultimately responsible. We want to tell the authorities that if prices continue to rise, the people will suffer too much and will no longer be able to survive. Unless the government does not want to win back the hearts of the people, it should quickly use all its strength to suppress prices. Otherwise, such a lax and incompetent government, not to mention that it will be greatly affected in preparing for war and defending the Yangtze River, even if it is begging for peace with a shamefaced face, it may not be valued by the other party, and the result will be more than dragging itself down!

### The United States Is Unwilling To Negotiate With The Soviet Union Outside of UN Institutions. Truman Agrees With Acheson's Position. Stalin Would Be Welcomed If He Could Visit Washington.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] President Truman told reporters today that Secretary of State Acheson thoroughly explained the government's attitude yesterday regarding Soviet Premier Stalin's informal invitation to meet behind the Iron Curtain, namely, that the United States is unwilling to discuss matters concerning other countries with the Soviet Union alone.

When asked whether the government would be willing to hold any negotiations with other countries outside of UN institutions, the President bluntly replied "No." However, the President took the opportunity to reiterate that Premier Stalin would be very welcome if he decided to visit Washington. I will ask my wife to prepare the best room in the Blair House (the President's temporary residence while the White House is being renovated) to treat him well. I invited Mr. Stalin to visit Washington during the Potsdam Conference. If Mr. Stalin is still interested in visiting, I will always be ready to learn from him.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] After meeting with President Truman today, US Chief Representative to the United Nations, Austin, told the press that the Soviet Union should prove its desire for peace with actions rather than words. The best measure of this desire is the attitude shown by the Soviet bloc in the Security Council.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Diplomatic sources said today that the second phase of the Cold War debate between Washington and Moscow will be launched by the Kremlin. The Soviet counterattack may take two paths: first, a renewed attack on the US for rejecting Premier Stalin's peace proposals, accusing it of deliberately wanting war; second, following the path indicated by President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson, proposing to resolve one or more outstanding issues.

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd, United Press] Britain has expressed great admiration for the US position against a private meeting between Stalin and Truman. Other Western European countries have also dispelled their fears about US-Soviet talks. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government "completely agrees" with US Secretary of State Acheson's opposition to the Stalin-Truman meeting. The policies of London and Washington clearly demonstrate that Britain and the US will continue to work together in the Cold War.

[United Press, Moscow, 4th] Soviet newspapers today published President Truman's speech yesterday, all under the headline "Truman Rejects Peace Talks."

### Soviet Union Instructs German Newspaper To Disclose Seven Conditions For Peace Proposal. Berlin Problem Is Key to East-West Struggle.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] US officials on the 4th rejected the Soviet Union's recently instructed seven-point "peace plan" and frankly declared that the conflict will continue until the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade. The recent peace proposal was put forward by a Soviet-controlled Berlin newspaper, which listed what it considered to be the seven most important conditions for resolving East-West disputes.

The seven conditions are: (1) withdrawal of US troops stationed in Greece; (2) withdrawal of US troops stationed in South Korea; (3) acceptance of the Soviet disarmament plan; (4) abandonment of the North Atlantic Security Treaty; (5) postponement of the plan to establish West Germany; (6) changing Western countries' policies in Berlin; (7) changing Western countries' plans for the Ruhr. US diplomats called these proposals "absurd and foolish," pointing out that the Soviet Union has "no intention of taking any action." Officials said the key to the entire East-West struggle lies in Berlin. Unless the Soviet Union abandons its attempt to force the US, Britain, and France out of Berlin by force, sincere negotiations to resolve all problems cannot begin. Because the Soviet Union is relying on its Berlin blockade to attempt to break through the current Western defenses, control all of Germany, and effectively control all of Western Europe. Officials also declared that under no circumstances will Western countries abandon Berlin.

### US Government Denies Agreement With Britain On Middle East Defense

Statement by US State Department Spokesman

### Rice Store Closure Enrages Mayor, Orders Reopening Today For Supply. Four Measures Agreed Upon To Maintain Order.

[Our Newspaper] To suppress the rice price, Mayor Wu announced an emergency measure the day before yesterday allowing citizens to purchase rice with purchase permits. However, to his surprise, all rice stores in the city closed yesterday, refusing to sell rice, and it was reported that black market rice was selling for as high as 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Upon hearing this, Mayor Wu was extremely angry. He specially summoned rice merchant representatives such as Qu Zhenhua to the VIP room of the City Hall for a discussion at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. Reporters heard Mayor Wu's thunderous voice from outside the door. The rice merchant representatives explained that the reason for the closure was fear of citizens搶購 (qiang gou, rush-buying/panic-buying). If the authorities did not have proper measures to protect them, accidents would be unavoidable. Therefore, they requested that the city government send police to maintain order, and all rice stores would immediately supply rice for sale. Mayor Wu approved the above request. Four supplementary measures were agreed upon yesterday: (1) District-based rice purchase: citizens must purchase rice from rice stores in their own district. (2) Rush-buying is prohibited. (3) Anyone who disturbs the order will be immediately arrested and sent to the Garrison Headquarters for military trial. (4) Citizens must present their own citizen ID when purchasing rice, and they are only allowed to purchase on behalf of their own family members.

Mayor Wu told reporters when he met with them yesterday afternoon that the use of the No. 5 purchase permit will have to wait for another day or two, because the rice allocated by the Food Department has not yet arrived. Wu also ordered all rice stores in the city to open for business today. If there is any [unclear] matter, the city government will order the police bureau to send personnel to sell on their behalf. All proceeds will be used as a special self-defense donation.

[Another Report] The household rice price for this month will be determined by the US ECA China Branch, the Food Department, and Mayor Wu, etc., and announced this afternoon.

### Education Bureau To Hold Meeting Today To Discuss Tuition Standards. Many Senators Will Also Attend. The Issue of Installment Payments Will Also Be Discussed.

[Our Newspaper] The City Education Bureau is scheduled to hold a meeting at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road at 3 p.m. today to discuss the tuition fees for public and private middle and elementary schools this semester. In addition to the principals and faculty representatives of public and private primary and secondary schools, senators Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Jizhou, Chen Boliang, Jiang Huaisu, Chen Gongda, Huang Bingquan, Zhang Zhongyuan, Qu Yue, and Zhang Yiqun will also be invited to attend.

The tuition standard proposed by the private middle school principals is calculated based on the tuition fees collected in the last semester, converted into rice. For elementary schools, it is about 7.5 dou to 1.5 shi, for junior high schools, it is about 1.75 shi to 2.5 shi, and for senior high schools, it is about 2.25 shi to 3 shi. However, due to the current excessive surge in rice prices, most parents are unable to afford the fees if they are collected according to this standard. Some principals have suggested paying in installments to reduce the burden on parents, which will be discussed at today's meeting.

The tuition standard proposed by the principals of municipal middle schools is 1.5 shi for senior high schools and 1.2 shi for junior high schools, including the teachers' advanced training fund. However, in order to seek equal treatment with private schools, the faculty of municipal middle schools suggested drafting a teacher's advanced training fund, charging 1.5 shi per student for senior high schools and 1.25 shi per student for junior high schools, and setting separate fees for other tuition and miscellaneous expenses.

It is reported that the man, Chen Zhongfan, 30 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 43 Houjiabang Road in the city, sustained a graze wound to his right foot. The woman was a young woman from Jiangbei named Zhang Baoshi (25 years old, who had just arrived in Shanghai from her hometown and was temporarily staying with relatives at the Xinminghua Barber Shop on Glan Road in Dapu). She was shot in the lower right abdomen, with the bullet entering from the front and exiting from the back, and her life is in critical condition. The two officers apprehended a suspect at the scene and took him to the station for questioning. He identified himself as Chen Xianfu, 21 years old, a Chinese medicine doctor. The precinct is currently dispatching officers to search for the fugitive.

### Tonight's Basketball League: Hualian vs. McLain's

Hangzhou Air Force School Team Withdraws from League

The Fourth Basketball League continues tonight with two Group A matches and one women's match at the Municipal Gymnasium. The main match is Hualian vs. McLain's. There has been a slight change in the schedule. The Hangzhou Air Force Officer School basketball team recently sent a letter to the Basketball Committee stating that due to recent academic busyness and transportation inconvenience, they will be unable to attend and regrettably withdraw from the league. The Basketball Association immediately convened a committee to resolve the issue. A week ago, the US Navy's Pfeiffer requested to join, and it was decided that the US Navy would fill the Officer School's vacancy. In today's three matches, Pfeiffer will play in the Officer School vs. Renyu match. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 50 yuan upstairs, 100 yuan downstairs, and 200 yuan for reserved seats in the arena. Lu Zijun of Siwei will maintain order. Today's schedule is as follows:

### Morning Friends Cup Decisive Re-Match: Huili Defeated by Three Points; Morning Friends Wins First Game

[Report from our Newspaper] The decisive rematch for the Group A championship of the Morning Friends Cup basketball tournament, between Huili and Morning Friends (best of three), was held at the Municipal Gymnasium at 7:30 PM last night. Huili lost by three points, with a final score of 65-62. Morning Friends led throughout the game, with a score of 37-21 in the first half. Huili lost too many points in the first half, and although they tried very hard in the second half, they were unable to surpass them. Looking at the performance in the last five minutes, Huili had a chance to come back, but they were ultimately unable to salvage the situation, much to the regret of the audience. The gymnasium was quite lively last night, with over 5,000 spectators. Wang Yongfang and Zeng Yongji were the most active for Huili yesterday, but the whole team seemed flustered and out of sorts. They had many opportunities to shoot, but they lacked accuracy. In particular, they only made twelve out of thirty free throws. Morning Friends' fast passing and pure cooperation were beyond Huili's reach. Morning Friends also took the initiative under the basket. Huili relied on long-range shots to score. In the first half, they once narrowed the gap to 10-9, but unfortunately, they could not surpass them at that time, and they remained behind for the rest of the game. Morning Friends won the first game, so let's see the second game.

### Scholarship Donations Set New Record; Anonymous Donor Generously Donates 100,000; Hoping Readers Will Continue Their Efforts

Since January 18th, we have made numerous appeals in the newspaper, hoping that enthusiastic readers will actively donate scholarships to encourage and support students. After the Lunar New Year, for many days in a row, we did not receive any significant donations. Seeing that the winter vacation was about to end, and countless students were still eagerly waiting, we could no longer bear to think about it! Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 100,000 yuan from an anonymous donor, 5,000 yuan from a donor who did not want to be named, 3,000 yuan from colleagues at the Bank of China, and 2,020 yuan from Mr. Zhang. These donations have greatly advanced our fundraising efforts, and the future of countless poor young people has begun to show a glimmer of dawn. Finally, we hope that readers from all walks of life can give us even stronger support and encouragement.

### Board Meeting to be Held Tomorrow, Stock Exchange Reopening Not Far Off, Personnel Issues to be Decided at the Meeting

[Our Report] According to reliable sources, the reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which has been in preparation for a long time, will be imminent within one or two days. The responsible officials of the Ministries of Finance and Industry have verbally notified the stock exchange authorities that the eleven articles of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Reopening Measures, passed at the 41st meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 26th of last month, have been formally sent to the exchange and are expected to arrive today. If the reopening measures arrive as scheduled, the exchange will convene a standing board meeting tomorrow to complete all necessary preparations for reopening in accordance with the provisions of the reopening measures and to determine the reopening date. At the same time, a final decision will be made on the personnel issues of the exchange.

After the exchange reopens, the securities to be listed, according to regulations, are: (1) government bonds, (2) state-owned enterprise stocks, and (3) private company stocks. In addition to the listing of the first two types of securities, which will be determined by separate orders from the Ministries of Finance and Industry, the 31 types of private company stocks that were originally listed, although many have not been approved for registration changes, the new regulations consider the listing and trading of these stocks as a preliminary agreement for transfer. Therefore, after the stock exchange reopens, they can immediately continue to be listed and traded. However, according to regulations, these stocks must still complete the registration change procedures within three months from the date of the exchange's reopening.

Furthermore, it is reported that with regard to the personnel issues of the exchange, in addition to the resignation of the original General Manager Wang Zhixin being approved, the resignation of the original Chief Secretary Hua Wenyu has also been approved by Wang Zhixin. The original Assistant Manager Yang Yinpu has requested to resign from the board of directors, but has not been approved and is still firmly resigning. The newly appointed General Manager Gu Shanchang has not yet taken office and is waiting for a final decision at the standing board meeting tomorrow. As for the employees of the exchange, in addition to one-third who have already accepted severance pay, there are still more than 100 people remaining. It is said that after the reopening, the exchange will temporarily maintain austerity and will not add new personnel.

### Overseas Remittance Exchange Rate Abolished

The overseas remittance exchange rate has been officially abolished by the Central Bank yesterday. Starting from the 5th, overseas Chinese remittances will be converted into Gold Yuan at the market price of transfer certificates. Regarding the abolition of the overseas remittance exchange rate, the Central Bank authorities stated that the reason for the abolition is that the overseas remittance exchange rate is lower than the price of foreign exchange certificates, which has already lost its significance, and is therefore abolished.

The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates rose again on the 4th, opening at 600 yuan in the morning. Trading became more active, and the price closed as high as 700 yuan at noon, an increase of 200 yuan compared to the 3rd.

### Inflow of Funds from Other Cities Continues, Easing of Credit Continues

Yesterday, the easing of credit in Shanghai continued. The Central Bank still sold few materials, and because prices have risen too sharply in recent days, buyers were generally cautious, and demand was scarce. The overnight interest rate hovered between 30 and 35 yuan. Banks and firms had more funds than they could use, and they actively reduced the interest rates for their customers, so the market turnover was very fluid. Furthermore, it is reported that cash funds are still abundant, and most of the circulating currency is in 50 yuan denominations, while 100 yuan denominations are still being sought after. It is said that the discount rate has slightly increased, only to 101 yuan per 100.

According to financial figures, the amount of funds arriving in Shanghai from other cities, either in the form of drafts or cash, has reached 3 to 4 billion yuan per day in recent days. The reason why the Central Bank's exchanges have shown a deficit since the Lunar New Year lies in this. Furthermore, it is reported that the total amount of deposits in the banking industry yesterday was estimated to be around 5 billion yuan. Although the amount has increased compared to the past, it is actually less than before compared to prices.

### Ban on Export of Edible Oil, Temporarily for One Month

[Our Report] The matter of temporarily suspending the export of edible oil and its raw materials from Shanghai has already been announced by the Jianghai Customs on the 2nd. The Customs yesterday issued a supplementary announcement that the temporary suspension of exports will be effective for one month from February 2 of this year.

### Silver Shops Request Reopening, Methods Being Negotiated

According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, the petition from silver shops requesting to reopen has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance by the Bureau of Gold Control. The Ministry is currently working with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to formulate more specific measures. Once these measures are submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, they will be announced and implemented. There are no problems with the issuance of short-term gold bonds. The issuance is currently awaiting the establishment of the Fund Management Committee. Once the committee announces its establishment, the issuance can be scheduled.

### Costs Higher Than Price Ceiling, Rice Market Trading Stalled, Authorities Threw Rice at Price Ceiling Yesterday at 5,000 Right

Rice market trading did not open in either the North or South markets yesterday. Because the authorities set a price ceiling of no more than 4,500 yuan per stone (150 catties) including commission, but merchants had high production costs and rising commodity prices, costs were higher than the price ceiling, so no one sold, and the North and South markets did not open. The market has come to a standstill, and market quotations have also stopped. The authorities threw 2,500 stones of rice in each of the North and South markets near the close of the market yesterday, throwing a total of 5,000 stones at the price ceiling, but because the procedures were not completed, the rice was not immediately distributed to rice shops.

Flour

The rising trend has not stopped. Lao Che (old brand) is shouting a price breaking the 3,000 yuan mark. Someone responsible in the market strongly urged colleagues not to raise the price so high. After the initial market rose to 2,750 yuan, no transactions were seen. Bing Chuan (military ship) rose sharply by 600 yuan and also opened at 2,750 yuan at the close. There were not many Red Bee transactions. Jiancheng (built city) did not open, and the prices of all other brands of flour rose sharply by about 30%. The rising trend of wheat bran continued. Fuxin Big Bag once broke the 2,000 yuan mark, and at the close, it slightly pulled back to 1,930 yuan.

Grains

Ben Gang Zhu Yi, as oil prices soared, oil factories have been sparing no effort to take in raw peanuts. People's hearts are firm and expensive, and the market has risen sharply. The prices of all goods have generally increased by more than 70%, all exceeding the 10,000 yuan mark. Yellow beans are extremely scarce. The grain merchants are pushing the price up. Zha beans have risen by another 20%. Corn was weak at first and then firm, rising slightly by 200 yuan compared to the previous day. Sesame merchants are holding on and not letting go. There were no transactions. Red sorghum and mung beans rose sharply, and picked Qing (grade) is urgently approaching the 5,000 mark.

Edible Oil

The rising trend in yesterday's market slowed slightly, but still saw a slight increase in the end. The market opened very late, and prices were very tight. The market turned weak at the close because external prices were flat. Soybean oil was first traded at 33,000, and closed at 31,000, rising by 2,000 yuan. Jitong raw oil was 38,000 yuan, and pure raw oil was also 38,000 yuan, rising by 4,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil was 26,000, rising by 2,000. Qing oil and cooked vegetable oil were firm at first and then flat, similar to yesterday. Soybean cakes rose by 400-500 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Continues to Rise Sharply, Cloth Market Turns Weak from Firm

The cotton yarn market continued to rise sharply yesterday. At the initial opening, the US Aid Council was still going to list and sell, and people were slightly worried. The market was still flat at the opening. Later, no sales were seen, and the price was pushed up again. Fine yarn rose by another 30,000 yuan, and coarse yarn also rose by 25,000 yuan.

The 42-count Blue Phoenix opened in the morning initially shouted 330,000 to sell. After the shouting, the trend was weak. Local street merchants watched and did not move forward. Merchants felt weak and frequently sold. The market turned weak and the asking price dropped to 270,000-280,000 yuan. After the low price, actual sales moved again, and the market improved. The market rebounded and closed at 320,000 at noon, rising 30,000 yuan.

The 21-count Shuangma (Double Horse) opened in the morning and sold for 200,000 yuan. People seemed to be still flat and weak, and the price fell back by 10,000 yuan. Later, because the yarn sellers did not come to the market, confidence grew slightly, and the market rebounded. The asking price rose to 220,000 yuan. After the high price, there were many floats and sales, and the market was slightly flat. At noon, it ended at 200,000 yuan, rising 25,000 yuan.

Cotton cloth continued to rise yesterday. The market was firm at first and then showed a slight weakness. Guangbang (Guangdong merchants) were hesitant because the Customs was about to implement a ban on the transport of cotton cloth to the south. Colleagues showed hesitancy, and there was a lot of selling on account. Retail investors felt that the asking price was already high, and the buying mood faded. Therefore, the market slightly weakened at the close.

Four Gentlemen Biji opened at 6,800 yuan. After opening, it continued to rise all the way. At around 10 o'clock, it once rose to 7,900 yuan. Later, it instantly fell back to around 7,400 yuan, hovering for a long time, and finally closed at 7,100 yuan at noon, rising another 600 yuan from the previous day. Jinlian Miaowu Biji fell from 7,500 yuan to 7,200 yuan. Tiaoli Yuanhui Guangliao closed at 4,500 yuan.

Longtou fine cloth once exceeded the 8,000 yuan mark, then retreated to 7,500 yuan. Longtou B fine cloth also fluctuated dramatically, rising from 6,400 yuan to 7,100 yuan, and finally closed at 6,600 yuan, rising by 1,100 yuan. Mid-range fine cloths such as Laba Tong, Wufu B Da Shuanglong, etc., all exceeded the 6,000 yuan mark, and transactions were still frequent.

Tung Oil Rises

The Tung oil market opened sharply in the morning yesterday, and the rising trend was as fierce as a wild horse off the leash. The reason was that the positions of colleagues were flooded, and the settlement transfer certificates continued to be active. People's hearts were strongly supported, and there was a continuous stream of buying in the market. The market developed rapidly, and transactions were also very exciting.

Correction: In yesterday's version, after the "Foreign Late Certificate Rises Sharply" item, the text from the fifth paragraph onwards in the front-page "Foreign Reporters Look at China" news was mistakenly included, resulting in inconsistencies. We urgently correct this.

### Yarn and Cloth Transport to the South, Minister of Industry and Commerce Believes Strict Restrictions Are Inappropriate

Private yarn mills have opposed the restriction on the transport of yarn and cloth to the south. The authorities believe that this measure has many drawbacks and are carefully considering it, and it is unlikely to be implemented in the short term. Yesterday, the reporter asked Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi about this matter. According to him, the purpose of economic measures should be to take into account the common and consistent interests of the whole country. It is not appropriate to make plans for one time and one place. Any division will cause damage to the economic interests of the whole country. The lessons of the past are not far away, and there is no need to repeat them. Therefore, in theory, the transport of yarn and cloth to the south should not only be permitted, but also encouraged to be sold throughout the country. Furthermore, the transport of yarn and cloth to the south has always been a major source of national foreign exchange income, and the clothing needs of the people in the southern provinces have always relied on Shanghai for supply. Moreover, the motive for the current transport of yarn and cloth to the south is mostly to preserve the safety of assets. At a time when the situation is turbulent, this is also understandable. Therefore, I believe that the transport of yarn and cloth to the south should not be restricted unconditionally under the current circumstances, but should be opened up as much as possible within the scope that does not affect the needs of the city, in order to facilitate economic exchanges and promote prosperity. This is also what the textile industry in the city urgently hopes to maintain its survival. It is reported that the textile industry in the city again sent many representatives to see Liu the night before last, urging him to open up exports. Liu expressed his willingness to sincerely consider the difficulties of the textile industry.

### After the Spring Festival in Hangzhou, the "City of Culture" Proposal is Undergoing Lively Discussion

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Hangzhou Report, 3rd] After the Spring Festival, due to the evacuation of various agencies from the capital, Hangzhou - a quiet area in Jiangnan - has also become bustling. The continuous passage and stationing of troops, with insufficient campgrounds, requisitioning of civilian houses, and the residences in the city station area have been requisitioned to varying degrees. People accustomed to comfortable houses in the Hubin area have no choice but to let their houses be inhabited by unfamiliar soldiers.

The Shanghai-Hangzhou train

is absolutely not on time. A friend who came from Shanghai happily said to the reporter: "I am very lucky, I finally walked for ten hours." One day, the station staff at the Shanghai-Hangzhou stations all hid, the reason for what? The reporter is not allowed to elaborate. What else can be said when the traffic is like this? Therefore, it is the fastest thing for Shanghai newspapers to come to Hangzhou every other day, otherwise it will take at least two days, how can people not be panicked?

The people of the paradise, known for their tranquility and ease, can't help but feel a little heavy when facing the reality in front of them. The most obvious is the fluctuation of prices. The black market price of gold ornaments is more than 50,000 Gold Yuan, and Yuan Datou (silver dollars) also costs more than 1,000 yuan. Rice has broken through the three-thousand mark, and cigarettes have tripled in price. Everything else is soaring, more than three or four times. In view of the chaos and the price increases, the shops have no choice but to take advantage of this Lunar New Year to rest for a few more days. Today should be the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, two days after "receiving the God of Wealth", but many shops have no intention of opening, and the market feels a sense of depression.

Small cars

have suddenly increased, and the most beautiful are the streamlined ones. Trucks and jeeps have all increased. Traffic police have to look at cars with "〇〇" numbers differently, because the owners often compare the capital to Hangzhou, and are not familiar with the traffic rules of Hangzhou. No matter what a one-way street is, they have to walk if they want to, rushing and hitting, it's simply outrageous.

Large hotels

are full of big spenders with a "capital" atmosphere. There are many who spend ten thousand gold at a time. Although they are evacuated, they are much wider than the people who live in Hangzhou. However, there are also some people, those who are evacuated by order, who are quite pitiful. They wander the streets, and they have to hesitate to buy a big cake. They carry their wives, children, and old people with them, and the future is vast. They don't know when it will end. Therefore, as long as the weather does not rain, the streets are always crowded with people. Although they are strolling around, their moods are tight, and they are uneasy all day long. The places where they live are extremely crowded, the things they eat are extremely simple, and when they are free, they have nothing to do except stroll around the streets. Fatigue and boredom fill everyone's faces.

Restaurants

also have their luck and misfortune. Some receive good customers, who spend tens of millions of gold at a time. Some receive poor friends, and some don't have a penny. However, those near transportation facilities often receive the latter, while those near scenic spots often receive the former. The shops that receive the latter complain a lot, and the shops that receive the former smile.

With the influx of passers-by in Hangzhou, sanitation has also become a very serious problem. Urinating everywhere and the stench are already commonplace.

In a panic-stricken situation, there is actually a group of

scholars

discussing building Hangzhou into a cultural capital. That was the topic raised at the sixth literary and art evening party of the Hangzhou office of this newspaper. Professors, artists, cultural figures, and news reporters from various universities unanimously requested that Hangzhou be built into a cultural city. Although it is now a time of war and chaos, for the sake of Hangzhou's century-long plan and for the future fate of Hangzhou, they all have the same view and the same request.

The Hangzhou Municipal Council, in order to cooperate with their proposed "undefended city", also proposed building Hangzhou into a cultural city. At their review meeting, they invited Professor Zhang Qi, who advocated building Hangzhou, and the reporter to give speeches. After we analyzed Hangzhou's natural environment, historical traditions, and future trends, they decided that Hangzhou's construction should focus on culture in the future.

Cooperating with this construction of Hangzhou as a

City of Culture

a lot of theater troupes are performing dramas in Hangzhou. Recently, the Chinese Drama Sar Society performed "The Government Inspector," followed by the Youth Military Drama Art Society's "Chai Tou Feng," followed by the drama exhibition of various theater troupes at the Drama Festival, followed by the Chunqiu Travel Drama Troupe's "Shen Yuan," and so on and so forth... Cultural activities are increasing. We need the cooperation of various different categories of cultural activities. No matter when the ideal of a "City of Culture" is realized, but since we have determined the direction, we should constantly work towards this direction.

### Jinan No. 1 Joint Middle School Opens Classes in Chang'an

[Our Chang'an Town Report, 3rd] Chang'an Town National Jinan No. 1 Joint Middle School, accommodating more than 2,000 Shandong refugee students, lives in the Lian Yuan Silk Factory and Chang'an Silk Factory in the town. Among these refugee students, there are many children who are only thirteen or fourteen years old. They are thinly clothed and have suffered the bitterness of wandering. Fortunately, the government and local authorities have provided assistance in various ways, so that they are spared the worry of freezing and starvation. During the Lunar New Year, the Chang'an Silk Factory also donated three stones of white rice to allow the students to have a good meal. Previously, the silk factory donated 2,500 pairs of socks to the students, which proves that the students and local people have a very harmonious relationship. At present, the school is actively preparing for classes, and more than 100 faculty members have been hired. It has also stored food for one month, and classes will officially begin in early February.

### Zhenjiang Arrests Silver Dollar Dealers, The Clanging Sound in the Downtown Area Disappears

[Our Zhenjiang Report, 4th] The local authorities have long banned silver dollar dealers, but the enforcement has been inconsistent. Before and after the Spring Festival, there were more "professionals" in the Zhenjiang market. Even teachers temporarily engaged in this career. The downtown area was full of clanging sounds. On the second day of the New Year, Yuan Datou rose to 980 yuan. It fell on the fourth day, and yesterday (February 2) it rose again to 1,150. Although the red disk of various industries has not opened, the black market is based on the rising of Yuan Datou. The public security authorities started arresting "silver dollar dealers" again on the 3rd. In the afternoon, the clanging sounds of silver dollars that filled the streets and downtown areas have disappeared.

### Pocket News

Changshu

[Our Report] Zhu Wenan, a returning township councilor (formerly the township head), and Chen Amai, his wife's younger brother, were suddenly shot and killed by thugs on the night of January 31. Because assassination cases have been repeatedly seen in the southern townships, the county council has strictly limited the solving of the case. The local prosecutor's office has sent personnel to the countryside to examine the body to help arrest the murderer and bring them to justice.

Wuxi

[Our Report] Recently, as the war has approached the Yangtze River, the trend of fleeing has become more intense, especially among important people traveling to Wuxi. The large and small cars on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) National Highway are full of travelers, fleeing to Shanghai one after another, causing people to panic. Ma Xiyuan, the president of the Wuxi Local Court, left Wuxi quietly on the Lunar New Year's Eve, carrying valuable luggage in his own car, to go to Shanghai and then to Guangzhou. Officials are free to evacuate, making him the first person in Xishan to do so. It is learned that Ma's trip is purely to visit his beloved wife and there is no other reason. If the situation improves, he will return to his post.

Fengxian

[Our Report] This county has been ordered to rush to repair the Nantai Highway connecting to the Pudong Avenue, which is limited to be completed before the 10th of this month.

After paying all the cash, he still owed about 10 stones. He first asked the manager, Hu Peiqing, for a loan, but was unsuccessful. He was then pressed by creditors such as Jin, and was overwhelmed with shame and resentment. He committed suicide with a rifle at around 12 o'clock on the night of the 1st. The bullet entered from the lower jaw and exited from the back of the head. Chen Shilin, the duty squad leader of the Hantang Town Office outside the West Gate, also committed suicide with a rifle by pulling the trigger with his foot at around 12 o'clock on the night of the 1st due to economic pressure.
