### Bai Chongxi and Three Others Go to Hangzhou to Urge the President to Assume Office; He Yingqin Will Enter Beijing Tomorrow to Form a Cabinet; It Is Expected That the Legislative Yuan Will Smoothly Approve It

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 11th] He Yingqin has agreed to enter Beijing to form a cabinet. This is the result of Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhutong, and Wu Zhongxin, representing Acting President Li, coming to Hangzhou today to urge the president to assume office. Bai and the other three are scheduled to return to Beijing on the 12th to report after congratulating He on his 60th birthday. He will enter Beijing on the 13th to begin forming the cabinet. Today, Bai, Zhang, Gu, and Wu had three earnest talks with He, in the morning, afternoon, and evening. It is widely speculated that these discussions may include the composition of the new cabinet. According to Wei Yongcheng, who accompanied Bai, it is expected that He will receive more than half of the votes of approval in the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the smooth establishment of the new cabinet is almost certain. This afternoon, when our reporter visited Tang's residence, the four representatives of Acting President Li were having lunch with He Yingqin, discussing cabinet matters. He initially expressed concern that with the current precarious state of the country and economic difficulties, he feared he would be unable to handle the position of premier. However, after repeated and firm urging from Bai and the other three, he finally accepted the mission to form a cabinet. Later, the reporter inquired about this matter with General Bai Chongxi, who greeted him with a smile. Although he did not give a definite answer, his joyful demeanor revealed that their mission to urge the president to assume office had been successfully completed without a doubt. In the afternoon, the reporter visited Zhang Zhizhong at the Provincial Government Guesthouse, first saying, "Mr. Zhang, your trip to Xikou must have been tiring." Zhang replied with a smile, "No, no. Xikou has mountains and water; it wasn't tiring." The reporter asked when General Zhang would return to Beijing. He replied, "I'll go back tomorrow." The reporter took the opportunity to ask, "Will Mr. He be going with you?" Zhang replied, "We still need to discuss it tonight." After a moment of thought, he told the reporter, "He can leave tomorrow. Definitely, definitely." After speaking, he hurriedly got into a car and left for Tang's residence. The 12th is the celebration of He's 60th birthday. On the evening of the 11th, Jiang Dingwen hosted a banquet at Tang's residence to warm up the birthday celebration and to welcome Bai, Zhang, Gu, and Wu. After the meal, they discussed the details of cabinet formation before dispersing late at night. Bai Chongxi and the other three arrived at Jianqiao Airport at 10:25 a.m. on the 11th, accompanied by seven staff members. Zhou, Chairman of Zhejiang Provincial Government, Hu Weike, Principal of the Aviation School, and other local officials greeted them. Zhang and Wu stayed at the Provincial Government Guesthouse, while Gu Zhutong stayed with He at Tang's residence. Madam He moved to the Xin Xin Hotel.

### Acting President Li's Official Letter Can Be Delivered in the Morning; Legislative Yuan to Meet This Afternoon; To Exercise the Right of Consent So That He Can Form a Cabinet Quickly

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the matter of appointing General He Yingqin to form a cabinet, after Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhutong, Zhang Zhizhong, and Wu Zhongxin went to Hangzhou on the 11th to earnestly urge and discuss, a formal agreement was fully reached at about 7 p.m. on the 11th. Bai Chongxi reported this result to Acting President Li by long-distance telephone at 8 p.m. Bai and others, having completed their mission to urge the president to assume office, are scheduled to return to Beijing from Hangzhou on the 12th to report. Acting President Li hoped that He would also return to Beijing on the same flight, but when Bai spoke to Acting President Li by long-distance telephone at 8 p.m., He had not yet decided whether to return on the 12th. However, this will not affect the Legislative Yuan's exercise of the right of consent.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Acting President Li decided to nominate He Yingqin as President of the Executive Yuan. The official letter nominating him and requesting the Legislative Yuan's consent is scheduled to be delivered to the Legislative Yuan at 9 a.m. on the 12th. Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Chen Kewen, Secretary-General, were notified by telephone at 9 p.m. on the 11th. Tong decided to convene a temporary meeting at 3 p.m. on the 12th, first holding a plenary review meeting to review it, and then exercising the right of consent to quickly decide whether or not to agree, in order to facilitate the formation of the new cabinet. The meeting notice is being rushed out overnight. Acting President Li had originally planned to deliver the official letter to the Legislative Yuan at 9 a.m. on the 11th, but because he had a long-distance telephone call with He Yingqin in Hangzhou on the evening of the 10th, as there were still some details to be discussed, the Presidential Office notified the Legislative Yuan that the official letter might not be sent out on the morning of the 11th. On the morning of the 11th, Acting President Li invited Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, and Gu Zhutong to fly to Hangzhou to earnestly talk with He Yingqin. At 8 p.m. on the evening of the 11th, Bai and others made another long-distance telephone call from Hangzhou, reporting to Acting President Li that some details had been largely resolved. Acting President Li then ordered the Legislative Yuan to be notified at 9 p.m. to prepare to convene a temporary meeting to exercise the right of consent. All parties expressed satisfaction with Acting President Li's nomination of He Yingqin as President of the Executive Yuan. It is expected that the Legislative Yuan will be able to smoothly approve it at the meeting on the 12th.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Acting President Li summoned Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, at his official residence at 9:30 p.m. on the 11th to discuss the issue of the Legislative Yuan exercising its right of consent on the nomination of He Yingqin as President of the Executive Yuan.

### In the Form of a Luncheon; Soliciting Opinions from Within the Party

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Acting President Li is scheduled to host a luncheon at the Presidential Office at noon on the 12th to entertain members of the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang and members of the Central Political Conference in Beijing, to solicit their opinions on the nomination of He Yingqin as President of the Executive Yuan. During the luncheon, they will also exchange opinions on the candidates for ministers and political committee members in the future new cabinet. It is widely believed that Acting President Li's move is because, according to Kuomintang custom, the nomination of a party member as President of the Executive Yuan must be approved by the Central Standing Committee. Since the Central Standing Committee cannot be convened in Beijing, he is soliciting the opinions of the members in the form of a luncheon. It is understood that there are more than 20 members of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Conference in Beijing. Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Liu Jianqun, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Zhu Jiahua, Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, Cheng Qian, Hong Lanyou, Li Zonghuang, Fan Yisui, Huang Shaoqu, Deng Wenyi, Wang Qijiang, Cheng Siyuan, Ni Wenya, Tang Ruyan, and Huang Yuren have all been invited. As a result, Cheng Qian changed his departure from Beijing to Hunan to the 13th, and Wu Tiecheng also postponed his trip to Shanghai. Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Gu Zhutong, who are urging the president to assume office in Hangzhou, may rush to Beijing from Hangzhou before noon on the 12th to participate and report on their discussions with He Yingqin.

### Sun Ke Will Rest and Temporarily Get Away from Politics

[Associated Press Nanjing, 11th] Former President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, told the Associated Press on the 11th that he would temporarily get away from politics and take a rest because he had not rested since returning to China from Europe in 1939. However, he said that he would continue to participate in the work of the ten-member committee drafting the peace plan, because the committee was originally temporary and would be dissolved after the work was completed. He said that the general principles of the peace plan had been drafted. He did not specify where he would go on vacation.

### Another Report on the Sinking of the Chongqing Warship; Guangzhou Newspaper Claims Two Other Warships Were Sunk at the Same Time; Location Is Somewhere Between Dalian and Lushun

[Associated Press Guangzhou, 11th] According to unconfirmed reports in Guangzhou's Chinese newspapers, the Nationalist Air Force not only sank the "Chongqing" cruiser, but also sank two other warships at the same time. The report said that the bombing location was somewhere between Dalian Port and Lushun Port. It is claimed that all 450 officers and soldiers on the "Chongqing" were killed in the bombing. The government dispatched two other warships to attempt to intercept the "Chongqing," but the Nationalist Air Force sank all three warships. At that time, the "Chongqing" fired anti-aircraft guns in retaliation, but the bombers repeatedly bombed for two hours until all the survivors were killed. The report also said that in addition to the "Chongqing," seven other warships had sailed to the Communist area in the past month.

### Barr and Jones Arrive in San Francisco Together

[United Press San Francisco, 10th] Barr, head of the US Military Advisory Group to China, and Jones, head of the Military Advisory Group to the Philippines, returned to the country together and arrived here on the 10th. Barr said of his impressions in China that if the authority of the advisory group was not limited to providing advice and teaching, its contribution to China's war effort would be greater. It is a pity that the advisory group was withdrawn. Many members made friends with the Chinese. Jones said that the Philippine armed forces had made rapid progress and would certainly be able to fight side by side with us again against the common enemy.

### He Yingqin's 60th Birthday; Dignitaries in Hangzhou Hold Celebrations

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 11th] The 12th is He Yingqin's 60th birthday.

### Unreasonable Price Increases in Postal, Telegraph, and Railway Services; Legislative Yuan Asks for Swift Cessation; Draft for Stopping Conscription of Soldiers and Grain Referred to Committee for Review

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] The price increases in postal, telegraph, and railway services, which took effect on the 11th, sparked strong opposition in the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 11th. The attending committee members unanimously criticized the impropriety of this move and passed a motion to quickly notify the Executive Yuan to stop it and not to recognize the new prices that took effect on the 11th. The Legislative Yuan held its fourth meeting of the third session on the morning of the 11th, with 181 committee members in attendance, presided over by Tong Guanxian. The meeting began at 9:30 a.m. After the report items, Zou Shuwen and others immediately proposed an emergency motion, requesting that the Executive Yuan be notified to quickly stop the price increases in the transportation industry, and that the price increases should not be arbitrarily increased before the methods for adjusting transportation prices and fees in the railway, postal, and telegraph services according to the cost index have been reviewed and approved. The prices announced today should not be recognized. The motion was approved by the meeting and declared for discussion. The committee members spoke one after another, unanimously believing that the postal law stipulates that postal rate increases must go through legislative procedures. Although railway price increases do not require legislative procedures, they should also be approved by the Executive Yuan. The current price increases have not been approved by the Legislative Yuan or the Executive Yuan, which is clearly illegal and should be corrected by the Control Yuan. Moreover, the income of civil servants is based on the cost of living index, but the railway, postal, and telegraph services are not based on the cost of living index, which is also unreasonable. This self-raising price method clearly has the suspicion of undermining the credibility of the Gold Yuan. After a long discussion, the chairman sought the opinions of the meeting and the entire meeting passed it without dissent. The discussion of the motions continued.

The first motion, proposed by Huang Tong and 33 others, proposed to quickly stop the conscription of soldiers and grain. It was resolved that the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee, the National Defense Committee, and the Food Administration Committee should each recommend five committee members to review it together, with the committee member of the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee as the convener. Other committee members may participate freely, and a report to the plenary session should be submitted within one week.

### The Draft on Simplifying Administrative Institutions Will Be Reviewed by the 15th

The second motion, proposed by Chen Guyuan and others, proposed to simplify administrative institutions and first amend Article 3 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law. After the original proposer, Chen Guyuan, explained the reasons, the committee members put forward their opinions on the departments and commissions that should be retained and those that should be merged, including the Water Conservancy Department being reduced to a bureau under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Land Administration Department also being reduced to a bureau, which may be changed to a Land Administration Committee in the future. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry should be changed from a ministry to a division due to its small amount of business. The Labor Bureau should not be directly under the Executive Yuan, but should be under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Mongolian-Tibetan and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committees should be changed to the Mongolian-Tibetan Division and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Division, which are under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, respectively. The Ministry of Judicial Administration can be handled by the Judicial Yuan, so there is no need to set up a ministry. In addition, some people believe that the simplification of institutions should not be limited to the Executive Yuan, and other Yuans should also be simplified. Overseas Chinese legislators opposed the reduction of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, and Mongolian legislators also opposed the Mongolian-Tibetan Committee being changed to the Mongolian-Tibetan Division. As of 12 o'clock, some people had not had time to speak, and it was decided to continue the discussion in the afternoon, and the meeting was adjourned.

The afternoon meeting continued, with 165 people in attendance, still presided over by Tong Guanxian. The discussion on the draft on simplifying the institutions of the Executive Yuan continued. The speakers continued to discuss the retention and merger of various ministries and commissions. Some people argued that the passive meaning is simplification, but in order to express active construction, those that should be established should also be added. Therefore, land administration should still be a ministry, and a "State-owned Enterprises Ministry" should be added to meet the purpose of developing state-owned enterprises in the Principle of People's Livelihood. A certain committee member believed that the revenue and expenditure should be prepared by the Ministry of Finance, and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics need not be changed to a department, and it should be simply abolished. Finally, it was decided to follow the opinion of the Procedures Committee, and each of the 21 committee members of the Yuan should recommend one person to review it together, with the committee member of the Legal System Committee as the convener. Other committee members may participate freely, and the review should be completed before the 15th and submitted to the plenary session for discussion. Xiang Zhenyu and 21 others were elected to be responsible for the review on the spot.

### Legislative Committee Members Continue to Report In

### Legislative Yuan Holds Secret Meeting; Passes Opinion Paper on Peace; Provides General Principles for Negotiation and Strives to Achieve Peace

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] The Legislative Yuan's plenary session on the 11th changed to a secret meeting at 2:10 p.m. to discuss the peace issue, and reporters were still refused to attend. The meeting was presided over by Tong Guanxian. The secretariat read the report on the peace issue opinions prepared by Huang Yuren and 21 others. Then, Huang Yuren and Lou Youwen explained the preparation process and said that in addition to the report, other committee members' opinions on peace will be collected by the secretariat at any time and sent to the government for reference. The committee members made various amendments to the wording of the opinion paper. Finally, the full text was passed unanimously, and the meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m.

### Full Text of Opinion Paper

The full text of the peace opinion paper drafted by the Peace Opinion Paper Organizing Committee of the Legislative Yuan is as follows:

Peace is the highest inherent morality of our Chinese nation, and it is also the urgent demand of the whole country at present. For two months, the government has advocated peace, and the Chinese Communists have responded in unison. Although there are differences in opinions and understanding, there is no difference in saving the country and the people. The colleagues of this Yuan come from all over the country and know deeply that the people's desire is to seek a permanent end to the scourge of war, to live and work in peace, to obtain a practical guarantee of basic human rights, and to concentrate the strength of the whole country to reform the status quo and build a unified and progressive new China. Now that formal peace talks are about to begin, it is appropriate to represent the public opinion, make an effective support with the utmost sincerity, and strive to realize the spirit of mutual concession and cooperation, seek the realization of peaceful construction, learn from the lessons of fratricide, eradicate the crisis of internal war, and the colleagues of this Yuan are responsible for this, and are willing to make the greatest efforts to promote its success, and hereby resolve as follows:

(1) During the recess of the second session of this Yuan, this Yuan expresses its approval and support for the government's various measures on peace.

(2) On various major issues, a reasonable solution should be sought in accordance with the principles of political democratization, economic socialization, military nationalization, and legalization of parties, which have been consistently advocated by both sides.

(3) The future peace talks should be handled carefully based on the above-mentioned people's desire for peace and the previous principles.

### President Tong's Remarks

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, told our reporter on the 11th regarding the peace opinion paper passed by the Legislative Yuan, this opinion was formulated on the general principles of peace, and the purpose is to make both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party agree. The Legislative Yuan does not intend to discuss specific issues, because peace talks are the responsibility of the government, and the Legislative Yuan only provides principles and hopes that the government can proceed based on these principles. If there are any opinions in the future, they should be raised at any time.

### The Chinese Communists Still Express Positively on Peace Talks

[United Press Nanjing, 11th] Although the government is now promoting plans to start peace talks as soon as possible, according to official announcements, the Chinese Communists have not yet shown a positive expression of preparedness to negotiate. Acting President Li is rushing to establish a new cabinet, whose main task is to negotiate peace with the Chinese Communists, but the troops of both sides are still being reorganized and reinforced, and the Communist army is repairing the railways and preparing for a large-scale crossing of the Yangtze River. Most political observers show pessimism about the prospects for peace, believing that although both sides are willing to make peace, their minimum conditions for peace are unacceptable to each other.

### The Wuxi County Council Calls for a Ceasefire and Peace Talks

[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 11th] The County Council decided at its general meeting on the 11th to send a telegram to Acting President Li and Mr. Mao Zedong, calling for peace, requesting an immediate ceasefire, and appointing senior officials to open peace talks as soon as possible. Any measures that hinder peace should be eliminated as soon as possible, and any contributions that are beneficial to peace should be adopted, so that swords can be turned into plowshares and violence can be turned into auspiciousness.

### Communist Army Concentrates Heavy Troops in Nantong; The 10th Column Originally Stationed in Yangzhou Also Moves East; The Rumor That Nationalist Army Withdraws South from Liuwei Is Not Accurate

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 11th] A certain unit of the garrison here denied today the rumor that the Nationalist army withdrew south from the Liuwei bridgehead. A military spokesman said that a certain division of our army stationed in Shijiaqiao, Sanwenhe, Liuwei, Guazhou and other places on the north bank of the Yangtze River is still confronting the Communist army in its original position.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Military news: The 10th Column, originally stationed in Yangzhou, is now beginning to move towards Taixian. The 9th Column has been confirmed to have been transferred to northern Jiangsu, and the unit is currently near Taixian and is moving east in the same direction as the 10th Column. According to unofficial military intelligence, the destination of the transfer of the two units seems to be the Nantong-Qidong area. In addition to the 9th and 10th Columns, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has the 11th Column in Rugao, which may have been transferred south to the area south of Jingjiang and Rugao. On the Taixian and Haitai sides, there is the 12th Column, which is still in its original position and has not shown any signs of being transferred as of today. On the Tongyu Line, the air force also discovered more than 20,000 troops a week ago moving along the highway towards Dongtai. Whether they continued to move south afterwards, the military has not yet received accurate information. As for the Nantong area, the 104th, 105th, and 106th regiments of the Communist Army's Yangtze River Column were originally stationed there, and the headquarters of the 9th Military Sub-district is also located there. According to the military's past intelligence, the Communist army around Nantong included the Dongru Guard Regiment stationed in Dingyan, the Tongru Detachment stationed in Baipu, the Nantong Guard Regiment stationed in Yudong, the Coastal Defense Regiment stationed in Juegang, and the Southeast Guard Regiment stationed in Juxingzhen.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 11th] Regarding the saying that Xu Shiyou's 10th Corps of the Communist Army was transferred to northern Jiangsu, the military here judged that it was very close to reliable based on intelligence from all sides, and the location of its headquarters should be in Huaiyin. According to captured Nationalist officers who returned from the south, they saw a road sign in the streets of Huaian County indicating the location of the liaison office of the unit, which read "Liaison Office of the 10th Corps."

[Reuters Nanjing, 11th] A dispatch from Zhenjiang said that more than 10,000 Communist troops, under the cover of heavy artillery, launched a fierce attack on Dahekou, ten miles west of Yizheng on the north bank of the Yangtze River. The situation there is unclear, and clear artillery and machine gun fire can be heard in Yizheng. At the same time, a large team of Communist troops moved south and reached Tianchang, which can be added to the battle in Yizheng.

### The Chinese Communists Establish a "Provisional People's Government" in the Central Plains

### Fifty U.S. Senators from Both Parties Request $1.5 Billion in Aid to China; Joint Letter Urges Foreign Relations Committee to Take Swift Action

[United States Information Service, Washington, D.C., 10th] Nevada Democratic Senator Pat McCarran released on the evening of the 10th a letter signed by himself and forty-nine other senators to the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tom Connally, urging the committee to take prompt action on McCarran's bill to approve $1.5 billion in military and civilian aid to Nationalist China.

The bill allocates $700 million for military aid, $300 million for civilian relief, and $500 million to stabilize the currency. The original letter reads as follows:

"The bill currently before the Foreign Relations Committee, S. 1063, calls for the United States to establish a definite policy toward Asia, providing effective assistance to the Chinese government on a realistic basis.

"Given the Communist successes in China and the Communist threat to control all of Asia, we cannot ignore our current problems for the sake of national security, and our entire nation cannot waver in the course of action we decide to take. We face problems of such magnitude, complexity, and urgency that further procrastination and hesitation are unwise in the extreme.

"Adopting a defeatist policy, taking a passive attitude, and turning a blind eye at a critical moment for nationalism is inconsistent with America's best traditions.

"While we may have deviated from these traditions in practice – and sometimes in principle – the fundamental responsibility for shaping American policy rests with the United States Congress.

"Therefore, we urge the committee responsible for foreign affairs to begin hearing opinions on the general situation in China and on S. 1063 at the earliest possible date, so that amendments deemed appropriate by the committee can be submitted to the Senate as soon as possible for debate and action.

"This matter – if it truly exists – is not one where Congress must wait for the executive branch of government to make a request before taking action. On the contrary, Congress has the supreme responsibility to clarify this matter and ensure its voice is heard."

An announcement released concurrently with McCarran's letter stated that the signatories included twenty-four Democratic senators and twenty-six Republican senators. The letter does not in any way compel the Foreign Relations Committee to take action on McCarran's bill.

### Editorial: Peace, Struggle. Save China!

— Reflections on the 24th Anniversary of the Passing of the Father of the Nation —

Looking north to Biyun Temple, gazing south at Purple Mountain, every year on this day, we pay tribute to the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, recalling the past, encouraging each other to follow the Three Principles of the People; but how many members of the Kuomintang can truly and deeply reflect and resolutely strive forward? Today, Biyun Temple has fallen into the hands of the Chinese Communist army, and Purple Mountain is almost under the threat of Communist artillery fire. Separated by a narrow strip of water, a myriad of sorrows fill our hearts! The Chinese Kuomintang today, from the central cadres to all party members, must feel ashamed and guilty, feeling that they have no face to face Dr. Sun's spirit in heaven. Although Acting President Li Zongren, President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke, and other important figures can still ascend Purple Mountain today to visit Dr. Sun's mausoleum and gaze upon his remains, I know that if they have any conscience, they will feel ashamed and regretful. As for the general Kuomintang members who claim to follow the teachings of the Father of the Nation, the best among them only seek to preserve their integrity, or feign madness out of indignation, or end their days in sorrow, or sink into the lower ranks, or retreat into the mountains, while the unworthy sell official positions, seize power, engage in deceitful diplomacy, and switch allegiances frequently. For the past twenty years, the Principle of People's Livelihood has been shelved, allowing the teachings of the Father of the Nation to fail to be promoted and developed. Looking back at the rise and fall of the Kuomintang since Dr. Sun's death, "Although it is said to be destiny, is it not also due to human affairs?"

The Father of the Nation deeply understood the difficulty of building a nation, so he advocated revolutionary nation-building and struggled for it for forty years, unyielding until the last moment of his life, when he earnestly admonished his followers, "The revolution has not yet succeeded; comrades must continue to strive." And what is especially valuable is that he pointed out a broad and smooth road for revolutionary nation-building: "Peace, struggle, save China!" Interpreted literally, this last testament is also very simple. These seven characters mean that what China urgently needs most is peace, but peace cannot fall from the sky, nor is it readily available; it requires the joint efforts of the people of the country who yearn for peace: only through struggle can peace be achieved, and only when peace is achieved can China be saved. In the past twenty-four years, except for the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan to fight for the survival of the nation, whether during the Northern Expedition or in the three years of civil war after the victory of the War of Resistance, we have not tasted the true meaning of this last testament of the Father of the Nation. But in today's environment, reading the Father of the Nation's will, we feel especially that the Father of the Nation's last words have profound meaning and are full of infinite truth. Unfortunately, we did not have the great wisdom and courage to do it practically before. If we do not catch up now, seize the opportunity, and do it practically, the opportunity will pass quickly. If we waste the good years in disagreements and infighting, we will not only fail the Father of the Nation's spirit in heaven, but also become a sinner of the nation!

The Three Principles of the People should still be the only way to revolutionary nation-building today. The reason why the overall situation of the country is so bad today and why the Kuomintang has failed is definitely not the fault of the Three Principles of the People, but the fault of the Kuomintang members for not truly striving to promote the Three Principles of the People. The Communist Party seems to be afraid to openly advocate communism today, and calls it New Democracy, forcing the people of North China to learn it together, which proves that China should still be a world of the Three Principles of the People. In terms of nationalism: although we are willing to sacrifice everything to obtain national freedom and equality, we are determined not to invade, nor do we intend to force other countries to follow us; internally, we advocate that all ethnic groups in the country are equal, everyone lives in peace, and we do not want the problem of ethnic minorities to occur, in order to maintain permanent peace in the country. In terms of civil rights: the Father of the Nation's goal was to make the people of the country completely equal in law and politics, and to divide political power and governing power, so that the government and the people can cooperate seamlessly and operate freely; and the central and local governments take the principle of balanced power, so that the historical division and reunification will not be repeated in the future. In terms of people's livelihood: from the beginning, it advocates labor-capital coordination, gradually eliminating the existence of classes, and equalizing land ownership and regulating capital can make the social economy obtain a long-term stable foundation. Therefore, the Father of the Nation's revolutionary theory is completely based on peace; his life engaged in revolution can be said to be completely for the peace of China, and at the same time, it can also be said to be for the peace of the world. In the national desire for peace, commemorating the death of the Father of the Nation, we, the people, especially the Kuomintang members, must take this opportunity to deeply reflect. The peace that we must strive to achieve in the future should be the peace that does not violate Dr. Sun's teachings, and should be the peace built on the foundation of determinedly implementing the Three Principles of the People.

Moreover, we must know why we demand peace, because we want to "save China." Therefore, saving China is the goal, and peace is the method. Assuming that everyone only knows how to shout for peace, but does not ask how to obtain peace and what kind of peace is obtained, in other words, only seeking the completion of the form of peace, and regardless of whether it can lead China to the road of salvation, then is that not the original intention of Dr. Sun's last testament? Now, in the Communist areas, people are forced to learn New Democracy every day and study Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions, as if these are the golden rules for the future. However, I have not heard that Kuomintang members and followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People still have the courage to believe that the thorough implementation of the Three Principles of the People is the first and foremost meaning of peace, which is really puzzling.

Whether it is a political party or a political reform movement, military failure is not enough to worry about, political failure is not enough to worry about, only spiritual failure is truly worrying. The Kuomintang today, regardless of whether the overall situation is resolved or not, cannot but consider that it has suffered a major failure. But this failure will not erase the Kuomintang's past great contributions to the nation, nor will it cut off the Kuomintang's future path to make efforts for the nation, as long as the Kuomintang members' spirit can be undaunted and undefeated. And today, what the Kuomintang needs to be cautious and fearful of, and strive to remedy, is precisely in this spirit! We hope to see the revival of the Kuomintang's spirit on the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation!

The implementation of entry measures is indeed necessary. However, it must be explained that this measure does not restrict the role of legitimate travelers, but is purely aimed at unemployed vagrants.

### Eight-Nation Atlantic Treaty Negotiations Concluded; Full Text to be Released Next Wednesday; Acheson-Danish Foreign Minister Talks Begin; Italian Prime Minister Announces Decision to Join the Treaty to Parliament

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 11th (Broadcast): Acheson met with Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen and Danish Ambassador to the United States Kauffmann this afternoon, initiating talks regarding Denmark's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. Hickerson, Director of the Office of European Affairs at the State Department, was also present.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] U.S. Secretary of State Acheson convened the ambassadors of seven countries – Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, and Canada – today for the final meeting regarding the North Atlantic Treaty. Before attending, British Ambassador Franks told reporters that after today's meeting, there would be no further meetings between the participating countries and the U.S. State Department regarding the treaty. Discussions on the treaty have concluded, and it will be ready for signing once approved by the respective governments. Today's meeting at the State Department focused on studying the reactions of European governments to the treaty. The treaty is expected to be released around next Wednesday, with signing scheduled for April 5th. According to dispatches from Rome, Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi announced the decision of Italy to join the treaty in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon. Observers generally believe that De Gasperi's statement will be a strong response to the recent announcement by Italian Communist leader Togliatti supporting the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Rome, 11th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi told 400 members of the Christian Democratic Party in both houses of parliament on the 11th that the Atlantic Treaty does not necessarily mean that Italy will participate in an actual war should a global conflict begin. Parliament will debate the Atlantic Treaty issue this afternoon, at which time De Gasperi will deliver a speech. De Gasperi stated that it is not stipulated that "participation in the treaty means Italy automatically enters the war. Even if war unfortunately breaks out, Italy does not need to go to the battlefield but will undertake a special non-combat role."

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen arrived here today from Europe to review the possibility of Denmark joining the North Atlantic Treaty. Given Greenland's important strategic position in the Atlantic, Denmark's participation in the treaty is of particular significance. Under the wartime treaty that is still in effect, the United States has the right to use bases in Greenland. It is believed here that if Denmark joins the treaty, the use of Greenland's bases by other countries under the treaty will be handled by the collective security mechanisms established under the treaty. A Danish spokesman here solemnly stated that the establishment of bases on Danish soil has not yet been discussed, except in the event that Denmark is attacked or threatened with attack.

### U.S. Military Aid Plan Includes Turkey, Greece, Iran, South Korea, and the Philippines; Acheson Attends Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Explain

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 11th (Broadcast): Acheson conferred with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this afternoon regarding the foreign military aid bill.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Government officials revealed on the 10th that the government's military aid program will be submitted to Congress for consideration in early April. This bill will request appropriations to purchase military equipment for signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty and other countries oppressed by the Communist Party, including Greece, Turkey, the Philippines, South Korea, and Latin American republics.

Officials said that accelerated consideration of aid to Iran is due to increased pressure from the Soviet Union on that oil-rich country. According to current plans, the government will request 1.5 billion in the aid fund to address emergency situations affecting U.S. interests in Atlantic Treaty countries, Iran, and non-communist countries.

### Republican Senator Brewster Advocates Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Republican Senator Brewster of the Senate Armed Services Committee expressed dissent on the 10th regarding the inclusion of the Philippines, Iran, and South Korea in the military aid bill. He stated that if the United States plans to provide military supplies to countries outside Europe, it should also provide them to the "independent government of China." He said, "At this time, the best place to send surplus military supplies to fight for freedom is to the independent government of China, which is fighting against communism. But if surplus military supplies from the European plan are given to China, it will be unsatisfactory because they are unwanted military supplies. This will be too late and too little."

### British-Turkish Talks Held

[Reuters, London, 10th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Turkish Ambassador to Britain Acikalin today, and they likely discussed regional defense measures. Observers believe that the discussions involved: (1) Soviet activities in the Ankara area and Turkey's ability to join the Mediterranean regional defense pact; (2) a declaration regarding Turkey, Greece, and Iran to be issued by Britain, the United States, and France when the Atlantic Treaty is signed; (3) Turkey's non-invitation to the meeting to be held in London to discuss the establishment of a European Council. It is believed here that Turkey felt disappointed by the invitation extended to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Italy and Ireland to attend the London meeting on establishing a European Council, hence the Turkish ambassador's visit to Bevin.

### Four Powers Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty; Agree to U.S. Proposal

Each to Draft Proposals for Resolving South Tyrol Dispute

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 11th (Broadcast): After the meeting of the representatives of the four foreign ministers today, U.S. representative Reber immediately proposed that the four powers each submit concrete proposals to resolve the South Tyrol dispute, especially explaining their attitude towards the treatment of ethnic minorities. Britain and France expressed their support.

The British representative expressed a willingness to submit a written text of the treaty guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Austria after World War I on Monday for the representatives to consider, to which the Soviet representative agreed. Therefore, the Soviet side will have to submit concrete opinions on resolving the stalemate no earlier than next Monday.

### Soviet Military Budget is Huge; Totaling Approximately $15 Billion; Supreme Soviet Begins Review

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 10th] The fifth Supreme Soviet convened at the Kremlin this afternoon. Premier Stalin, First Deputy Premier Molotov, Deputy Premier Mikoyan, new Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, and Politburo members Malenkov, Voroshilov, Shvernik, Suslov, Kaganovich, and Beria were all present. The agenda will include reviewing the 1949 federal budget and reporting on last year's budget. The congress will also approve various decrees issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet since the fourth session.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 10th] Soviet Finance Minister Zverev presented the largest budget in Soviet history at the joint meeting of the Federal Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet tonight, requesting an allocation of 79 billion rubles for national defense expenditures this year, an increase of approximately 20% over last year. The new budget stipulates total national treasury revenue for this year at 445.28 billion rubles and total expenditures at 415.355 billion rubles, with a surplus of 30 billion rubles. Last year's total revenue was 408.4 billion rubles, total expenditures were 368 billion rubles, and the surplus was 39.6 billion rubles. Although there is currently no free market to determine the international exchange rate of the ruble, according to the official rate, one ruble is approximately equal to 19 U.S. cents. Based on this, the current Soviet military budget is equivalent to $15 billion. (Note: The total U.S. budget for this year is $41.858 billion, of which $14.3 billion is for national defense expenditures.) An accurate comparison of the military budgets of the United States and the Soviet Union is not possible due to different items, price fluctuations, and the lack of sufficient reports from the Soviet Union on the above factors. Zverev declared that the increase in national defense expenditures was largely due to the rise in wholesale prices after the government abolished subsidies, but the Soviet Union will continue to pursue a policy of world peace. He also vehemently criticized the United States, accusing the United States of being responsible for the current chaotic international situation, stating that the U.S. military budget this year is more than 15 times that of 1937. Zverev also criticized Britain's increase in defense expenditures.

### Royal Issues Army Annual Report; U.S. Troops to Remain in South Korea Until South Korean Forces are Fully Trained and Equipped

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] Moscow Radio announced that the North Korean delegation to the Soviet Union attended the opening ceremony of the Supreme Soviet Congress on the 10th.

The report stated: The basic economic goal of the U.S. military government is to "cultivate Korea's economy so that it can be free from the control of Japan or any foreign country in order to ensure political independence." However, due to "economic dislocation and material shortages, agricultural production has decreased." At the same time, "the implementation of basic policies has been restricted due to the obstruction and sabotage of local minority groups."

[United Press, Seoul, 11th] President Syngman Rhee told South Korean journalists on the 11th: He fully supports the "eventual" withdrawal of U.S. troops, but "we all agree that before the U.S. troops withdraw, we must first equip and train the national defense forces. We are not asking U.S. troops to remain to protect us, but we are asking that at least a small number of troops be retained to help us train our troops." He stated that raising the issue of U.S. troop withdrawal at this time is tantamount to supporting Soviet policy.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] It was revealed on the 10th that Secretary of State Acheson is requesting Congress to authorize the United States to provide the United Nations with "supplies, equipment, labor, and other assistance" in addition to the United States' contribution to the proposed world international security force in order to assist in the implementation of United Nations decisions. This request would authorize Truman to sell or give to the United Nations equipment he deems necessary to support actions formulated by the United Nations. This request is included in a series of amendments to the 1945 Act of Participation in the United Nations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin hearing this recommendation on the 10th. Acheson recently notified the committee that such authorization is essential to "clarify and supplement" existing powers, especially to assist the United Nations committees on Palestine, Indonesia, the Balkans, Korea, and Kashmir, and will be used for objectives such as enforcing a truce in Palestine.

Philippine representative Romulo directly accused the Netherlands of not allowing the Indonesian Republic to return to Yogyakarta in order to organize another puppet state in the area. The roundtable conference in The Hague is merely a "rubber stamp." Indonesian representative Palar accused the Netherlands of using Nazi methods in Java. He demanded that international authorities investigate the methods used by the Dutch army in Indonesia. A spokesman for the U.S. representative revealed that the United States also intends to take a firm stance towards the Netherlands. The U.S. representative will firmly demand the earnest implementation of the Security Council's resolution.

### Britain Hopes India Will Amend Constitution; Maintain Dominion Relationship

Deeply Concerned About Nehru's Remarks

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 11th (Broadcast): According to official news, after Australian Foreign Minister Evatt came here from New Delhi, the British government immediately dispatched four special envoys to various dominions. It is said that Nehru informed Evatt of the content of India's future constitution, and Evatt immediately relayed it to British Prime Minister Attlee. Evatt repeatedly stated that among the countries in Southeast Asia, only India has the strength to be a bulwark against communism. Therefore, Evatt earnestly requested Prime Minister and Bevin to strive for an agreement with the dominion countries to ensure that India can become an independent republic while still maintaining a dominion relationship. However, the Indian Communist Party strongly opposes this, claiming that Britain and the United States are plotting to launch a "capitalist offensive" in India. The British government is deeply concerned about this pressure on Nehru, and therefore urgently seeks to remedy the situation in the Indian constitution, ensuring that under any political system, India can maintain a consistent pace with other dominions in "preserving the democratic forces in the Far East."

### Loan for Public Utilities; National Bank Promises to Lend in Kind; Quantity of Oil, Coal, etc. Needed to be Determined Every Half Month for Purchase; Council to Review Pricing Basis Today

[Our Own Dispatch] The Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council, the pricing basis review representatives, together with the Director and Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, conducted a review of the accounts of various public utility companies at the Public Utilities Bureau conference room starting at 10:00 AM yesterday and discussed the amount of the loan to be obtained from the National Bank and the procedures to be followed. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, they went to the National Bank together to consult with President Liu on the loan issue. Those who went together included Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue, Councilors Zhang Zhongyuan, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, Ma Junshuo, Jiang Haoran, Shi Zongde, etc. According to President Liu: In order to maintain public utilities, the National Bank has an unshirkable duty to lend. However, lending a large amount of money seems inappropriate. At this time, when the National Bank is ordered to suppress prices and tighten credit, if the National Bank lends a large amount of cash, it will inevitably flow into the market and affect price increases. After consulting with Minister of Finance Xu Kan, it was deemed that public utility loans should be handled in two aspects: (1) Each company can submit the minimum quantity of fuel oil, coal, and materials needed every half month to the Public Utilities Bureau for review, and then submit it to the National Bank for purchase and direct lending in kind to the company. When the end of the second half of the month arrives, the payment should be made based on the market price at the time of purchase plus interest. (2) If trolley companies, etc., have economic difficulties in making salary payments, the National Bank can grant cash loans as appropriate. The Municipal Council believes that the method proposed by the National Bank is reasonable in that it avoids affecting the market economy, and that the operations of various companies can continue to be maintained after lending in kind. Therefore, the loan principles have been determined. However, this is a temporary solution. In the future, the adjustment of public utility prices must be based on multiples of the cost of living index. The representatives of the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council who reviewed the pricing basis decided to continue to hold a meeting in the Public Utilities Bureau conference room at 10:00 AM today to review and determine the pricing basis of various public utility units.

### Coal Shortage on Two Railway Lines Temporarily Resolved; National Bank Approves Advance Payment of Funds for 5,000 Tons of Coal; Number of Passengers Scarce on First Day of Fare Increase

[Our Own Dispatch] The coal shortage problem of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has now been temporarily alleviated. The Central Bank of the city was ordered by the Ministry of Finance yesterday to allow the bureau to raise funds for 5,000 tons of coal. The bureau purchased 1,400 tons of bituminous coal on the same day, and the coal payment was directly allocated by the National Bank to the Four Mines Joint Operations Office and the Bituminous Coal Adjustment Committee. The remaining 3,600 tons are still under negotiation. The bureau hopes to complete this within a few days to avoid rising coal prices. According to a spokesman for the bureau, the coal shortage can be temporarily resolved after all 5,000 tons of coal are purchased. However, efforts still need to be made to reorganize railway revenue to increase the economy and seek self-sufficiency.

Also, yesterday was the first day that the bureau adjusted fares. Passengers, unable to afford the high fares, reduced their travel class. Therefore, there were few passengers in first-class carriages. Only about 200 first-class tickets were sold at the North Station throughout the day.

[Our Own Dispatch] Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue reported on the project to solve the water shortage in West Shanghai at the municipal conference yesterday, stating: The project to connect the water supply of West Shanghai to the Nanshi Water Plant is the central task of the Public Utilities Bureau in the 37th year of the Republic (1948), and the purpose is to transport the surplus water from the inland water plant to the pumping station at the Zhongzheng West Road reservoir.

### Over 100 Northeast Refugee Students Sent to Shelter for Temporary Residence

Education Bureau Says Borrowing Study in Shanghai is Difficult

[Our Own Dispatch] More than 150 Northeast refugee students came to Shanghai via Qingdao, with ragged clothes and no way to solve the problem of food and lodging. They gathered yesterday to request relief from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau.

Zheng Jie, Chief Secretary of the Education Bureau, issued a statement on the issue of refugee students, stating: There should be no problem with food and lodging for refugee students in Shanghai. Although the Education Bureau does not have a special organization to handle this matter, the Social Affairs Bureau can provide temporary relief according to the methods of relieving ordinary refugees. As for the refugee students' intention to borrow study in Shanghai, the possibility is very small due to practical difficulties. The only thing the Education Bureau can help with is to help arrange for the railway bureau to purchase train tickets to go south.

### German Doctor Extorted, Three Defendants Released on Bail for Further Questioning

[Our Newspaper's Report] The three defendants accused of extorting Dr. Stolar, a German overseas Chinese doctor - Barten, former deputy leader of the Economic Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau, Vasilief, a foreign affairs police officer, and Grichnen, a Soviet real estate businessman - appeared in court yesterday afternoon in response to the summons of Judge Wang Kanghou of the District Court. They met the plaintiff, Stolar, for the first time in court, and all denied that they had colluded in extortion. After a patient hearing in court, the judge ordered further trials after important witnesses were summoned. Defendant Barten was ordered to pay a written guarantee of 500,000 yuan, and the other two defendants were each ordered to pay a written guarantee of 300,000 yuan.

The accusations against the defendants are as follows: Stolar was familiar with Hoven (on the run), a Soviet foreign affairs police officer from the police station. Stolar had a self-defense pistol and had entrusted Hoven to obtain a gun license on his behalf. Unexpectedly, he was later suspected of selling arms and was summoned by the Changshu Branch on December 24th of last year. It happened that Grichnen, who was familiar with Stolar, was at the bureau to renew his residence permit, so he took the opportunity to persuade Stolar to give Barten and Vasilief US$500 to settle the case. Stolar pretended to cooperate, and then Grichnen repeatedly demanded payment and arranged to go to Stolar's residence on Sichuan Road on the 30th of the same month to pay the money. Stolar reported to the police station, who sent officers to wait. As a result, the case was solved on that day, and the defendants were arrested.

### Jue Lu Hotel Shooting Incident, Four Accomplices Continue to be Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the night of February 27th, Zhu Yuanming, a contractor, was shot and wounded in the abdomen next to the escalator on the fourth floor of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Middle Road. Duan Zixin and Wang Songlin (soldiers), the perpetrators, were arrested on the spot by the Laozha Police Station. They admitted to the crime and stated that they used to specialize in pickpocketing at the Longhua Airport. Later, Zhu Yuanming found out about it, and they feared that he would report them to the police for wanted status. Therefore, they gathered four soldiers, carrying Type 38 rifles, to negotiate with Zhu. They first met at the entrance of Sanyuanfang on Xizang Road, but Zhu cleverly escaped. They chased him to the fourth floor of the Jue Lu Hotel, intercepted him, and attempted to extort two taels of gold from him without success, so they shot him and injured him. At the same time, they confessed to having committed numerous crimes, including stealing a large sum of money from the travel bag of wood merchant Diao Jinwen, etc. The other day, the Laozha Branch received a tip-off that accomplices in the case were hiding in a room at the Jinshan Hotel. Zhang Kuidong, the director of the squadron, ordered Inspector Pang Yihua to lead police officers Yang Zhongming and others to rush to the address. They arrested Wang Jiafu, Liu Yichun, Bao Chao, and Liu Jingshan, who all admitted to participating in the shooting of Zhu Yuanming.

### Employees Pre-borrowing Salaries, Social Bureau Does Not Accept, French Electricity Asks Management for Opinions, Director Shen Instructs to Negotiate Independently

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Gotron, the management representative of the French Tram Company, visited the Social Bureau yesterday to discuss the pre-borrowing of salaries for the company's employees. It is said that the employees are requesting to be paid 15 days early each month to cope with the rising prices. The management replied that it could be considered if a loan from the Central Bank was successful, otherwise there was no hope. Director Shen of the Labor Department instructed them to handle the matter through independent negotiation, and the Social Bureau does not intend to participate in this request.

Regarding the pre-borrowing of salaries for employees, the reporter interviewed Director Shen of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau yesterday. According to him: Although he had heard about this matter, neither the labor nor the management has made a formal request so far, so it is not appropriate to consider any measures. As far as the current situation is concerned, the hardship of the workers' lives and the difficulty of the management's production and sales are both true facts. The Social Bureau should take care of both parties. The situations of various industries are different. If there is such a request, it should be negotiated independently by the labor and management. If the management's strength can bear it, it can be handled after consultation. However, this is not a statutory system, and the Social Bureau will not accept or mediate any labor disputes of this kind.

### No Longer Levying Vegetable Supply Fees and Self-Defense Donations Separately from Each District, Report to the Civil Affairs Bureau for Investigation if There is Forced Apportionment

Regarding the issues of vegetable supply for the garrison troops and the collection of self-defense donations in this city, Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Bureau stated yesterday: In February, due to the inability of the military-civilian cooperative societies in each district to be established and the failure to raise funds for vegetable supply on schedule, the military-civilian cooperation committee decided to temporarily allow each district to apportion the supply locally, which will be reimbursed by the municipal government in the future. From March 1st, the vegetable supply fees will be allocated by the municipal government, and no longer apportioned by the districts. The funds for the self-defense teams of the people in each district will also be included in the municipal government's budget, and there will be no separate orders for each district to raise donations on its own.

### Forced Landing in Jinan, CNAC Pilot Continues to Talk About Experience, One Woman Among Those Who "Contributed" to Hijacking, Shot at While Flying Over Jinan Airspace

[Our Newspaper's Report] After returning safely from being detained for 38 days after being forced to land in Jinan, the American pilot Hershelk of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight 135, from Shanghai to Qingdao, added the following details to the reporter: There were six passengers who hijacked the plane, one of whom was a woman holding a baby. They all spoke fluent English, as if they had been to the United States. He could not determine whether they were communist personnel, because when the plane flew over Jinan airspace, it was shot at by the communist army on the ground, which obviously did not expect the arrival of the plane. However, after landing, these passengers handed him and other passengers over to the communist authorities. Later, during the detention, several of them came to meet him. The leader, wearing military uniform, repeatedly expressed his apology. He was questioned three times by the communist authorities, and what was asked was his personal experience and information about CNAC and the US Air Force. He was deeply puzzled by their reasons for hijacking the plane. According to his guess: their purpose may not have been to obtain the plane, or it may have been because they wanted to go to Jinan, so they took this fastest route.

[Our Newspaper's Report from Qingdao on the 11th] The reporter obtained confirmation from CNAC passengers who disappeared in Jinan (who returned to Qingdao safely on the evening of the 8th) that the hijackers were four officers dismissed from the Air Force, who, in addition to hijacking the plane to the communist area to "contribute", had no other purpose. When they were detained, they were treated like criminals, eating corn buns and pickles, but when they were released, the communists killed chickens and set out wine to entertain them.

### Stories of the Literary World, Fan Xuejun Receives the Most Votes, Not Elected as Queen of Storytelling, Second Place Xu Xueyue, Princess Zhang Lijun

Crowning Ceremony to be Held at Lido on the 19th

[Our Newspaper's Report] In 1946, the election of Miss Shanghai and Singing Queen caused a sensation. In the three years since then, there have been no similar grand events. Recently, the storytelling and ballad singing circles are unwilling to be lonely and have launched an election for the Queen of Storytelling. A few days ago, the "Shanghai Literary World Weekly" issued 24,000 ballots commissioned by various storytelling venues in this city. After the "ballad singing fans" voted, famous female ballad singer Fan Xuejun was elected Queen with 2,405 votes. Xu Xueyue, nicknamed "Little Old Lady", was elected Second Place with 1,942 votes. Zhang Lijun, known for singing "Yang Naiwu and Little Cabbage", received 1,368 votes and was elected Princess. For this reason, the literary world in this city has specially formed a "Preparatory Committee for the Crowning Ceremony of the Queen of Storytelling", which is responsible for the preparations by Yang Binkui, Director of Guangyu Society, Chen Zizhen, representative of the storytelling venue, and Zhang Jianfan, Gao Shangde, etc. It has been decided that the crowning ceremony will be officially held at the Lido Garden at 1:30 p.m. on the 19th of this month. Huang Jinrong and Yan Duhe will be invited to attend and preside over the crowning ceremony. The "Queen's Crown" was donated by Ding Baoying, Fan Xuejun's godmother, and is currently being rushed to be made by specialized technicians in the style of the Dutch Queen's crown. The crown is made of pure gold, and the labor costs alone require hundreds of US dollars, so it is extremely valuable. Fan is famous in the literary world for singing "Begonia", and is currently the only popular figure in the storytelling and ballad singing circles. Because of her excellent appearance and skills, she has more than 10,000 fans and listeners. She broadcasts on the radio for one hour every night and requires a basic salary of 1,500 yuan per month, which shows how popular she is. As for the Second Place Xu Xueyue and Princess Zhang Lijun, they are still singing in Changzhou, and those who are captivated by their pipa music are also quite numerous. On the day of the crowning ceremony, all the "Xiangdang" in Jiangnan will gather in Shanghai to attend the ceremony. (Attached is a recent photo of Fan Xuejun, taken by this newspaper)

### Zhang Fengzhou Reports on His Experiences in the North, Mao Zedong's Industrial and Commercial Policy is "Develop Production, Benefit Both Labor and Capital", etc. Sixteen Characters, Industrial Circle Holds Meeting to Study Barter Trade with North China

[Our Newspaper's Report] The "North China Distribution Research Committee" decided at the sixth meeting of directors and supervisors of the Municipal Industrial Association held its first meeting at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 20 representatives from various industries such as textile, reproduction, rubber, underwear, chemical, paper, and wool textile attended. The committee had pre-invited Wei Wenhua, Zhang Fengzhou, and Shen Dongmei, who had recently returned from Beiping, to attend the meeting and report. However, Wei Wenhua and Shen Dongmei did not arrive. It is said that Mr. Wei suffered from a "severe cold" after returning to Shanghai and declined all public gatherings and private visits. After the meeting was opened, Chairman Hong Nianzu reported the purpose of the meeting, and then invited Zhang Feng to talk about his experiences in the North. Mr. Zhang said: This trip to Peiping was far more fruitful than expected. He personally is very optimistic about the prospects for peace. After this visit, all previous doubts about the sincerity of the CCP for peace have been answered affirmatively. Although whether true peace can be achieved still depends on the official dispatch of representatives by both the KMT and the CCP to negotiate, it is beyond doubt that peace talks can be realized. Being able to achieve peace talks is enough to indicate that everything is open to negotiation.

Factories Have No Major Losses

Mao Zedong's industrial and commercial policy has sixteen characters: "Develop production, prosper the economy, consider both public and private, benefit both labor and capital." All factories have started work and increased production. Labor-management relations are very good under the principle of "mutual benefit". Except for the Tianjin Zhong Textile Factory 7, which was destroyed by artillery fire, all factories have no major losses. The "takeover" of state-owned enterprises only involves sending a small number of personnel to supervise, and there is very little interference with private factories. The "learning" trend in Peiping is very strong. Regardless of institutions, schools, or factories, they are enthusiastically engaged in "learning". The so-called "learning" means learning the CCP's ideology and style. For example, when the communist army first entered the city, Peiping municipal government personnel took off their suits and leather shoes and hid them, not wearing them. After learning about this, Ye Jianying immediately summoned all his subordinates and gave them a lecture, telling them that there was no need to put aside their original Western clothes and not wear them. In the future, being able to advocate thrift and use less foreign goods is enough. Therefore, Western-dressed customers reappeared on the streets of Peiping. The currency system in the communist area is based on the Renminbi, and various local currencies will be gradually withdrawn. "Yuan Datou" and "US dollars" were still commonly used at that time, and transactions were very active. Approximately 15 "Datou" could be exchanged for one US dollar.

Technical Personnel Receive Slightly Higher Treatment

The Communist Party also recognizes the Three People's Principles, and especially emphasizes the Principle of People's Livelihood. The style is quite moderate. The negotiations on opening air and postal services were very successful, and flights are also being restored, even including the China National Aviation Corporation, which has foreign shares, but is not made an exception. In terms of industry, the Communist Party has slightly increased the treatment of technical personnel, and everything else is generally the same as the old system. Salaries are based on millet, etc. After Mr. Zhang's report, the association discussed the issue of barter trade with North China; Tian Heqing, Fu Liangjun, Xie Tiansha, Wang Guoxian, Pan Shihao, Ye Fokang, Guo Yongxi and others all spoke enthusiastically. Generally, Tian, Fu, Ye and others believed that barter trade with North China was urgent, otherwise the factories in Shanghai would not be able to survive due to the lack of raw materials and the stagnation of finished products. Pan and Guo and others believed that it was only necessary to conduct research at present, and it was not possible to talk about barter trade, and it was not appropriate to act rashly without obtaining the consent of Director Du. Finally, it was decided that Secretary-General Ouyang Lun of the Industrial Association would report this situation to Director Du, and Du and Wei Wenhuan would first establish contact with them so that they could understand the situation in North China. At the same time, various industries are preparing data for discussion at the next meeting.

### Hong Kong Tricycles to Sail to North China Immediately, Hong Kong Business Circles Express Optimism About the Prospect of Trade

[French News Agency Hong Kong, 11th] In order to formally restore trade between Hong Kong and North China, three ships will set sail for the Communist area within 48 hours. Two are ships of the British Jardine Matheson & Co., and one is a Panamanian freighter chartered by Chinese businessmen, for the purpose of exchanging goods between Hong Kong, Tianjin, and Weihaiwei. Another ship belonging to Swire Shipping will also sail from Hong Kong to the North China region for a trial voyage.

### China's Mecca: Pilgrimage to Hezhou

— Our Correspondent Song Lin

[Dispatch from Lanzhou, July 7] In the eastern foothills of Mount Jishi, in the middle and lower reaches of the Daxia River, lies a hilly region. Looking from afar, one sees temples of various sizes standing every three to five li among the mountains, valleys, plains. This is China's Mecca - Hezhou.

Hezhou was called Fenglin Post Station in the Han Dynasty, Baohan Prefecture in the Tang Dynasty, and Hezhou Guard in the Ming Dynasty. Since the Republic of China, it was first renamed Daohe County, and is now called Linxia County. The name "Linxia" is relatively new, and many people are unfamiliar with it, but when Gansu's Hezhou is mentioned, everyone says they have long admired its name.

Center of Faith for Hui Compatriots

Although Hezhou is just one of more than two thousand counties in the country, this county does have unique characteristics. It not only produced one member of the National Government (Ma Lin), six provincial chairmen (Ma Fuxiang, Ma Qi, Ma Fushou, Ma Hongbin, Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui), and four army commanders (Ma Buqing, Ma Jiyuan, Ma Chengxiang, Ma Dunjing), but it is also a prominent Hui Muslim area, the center of faith for Hui compatriots. In the past, due to poor transportation, people generally had a mystical sense of allure and terror mixed together, regarding it as a special region. In the past, some busybodies may have deliberately exaggerated this to increase the distance between the local area and the central government, seeking opportunities to advance their own interests. But now, they have long embarked on the path of sincere unity. If there is still anything special, it is only that some people have different religions and customs from people in other places.

Hezhou governs four counties: Linxia, Yongjing, Hezheng, and Ningding (now, when people generally speak of Hezhou, they narrowly refer only to Linxia County). The total population of the region is more than 443,000, of which Muslims account for more than half, scattered in every corner of the four counties. In the eastern part of Linxia and the northern part of Ningding, a mountainous area of ​​fifty kilometers has many people scattered in cave dwellings, living a simple life of cave dwelling and farming. They are firm in character, live a hard life, and devoutly believe in Islam, but they are of Mongolian descent. According to research, a branch of the Mongolian royal family of the Yuan Dynasty converted to Islam. Because they were exiled, they wandered to the barren and sparsely populated Dongxiang area of Hezhou before settling down. After five or six hundred years of reproduction, there are now nearly 100,000 people. Many of the place names in this area use Mongolian sounds. The Mongolian script has been completely lost, but the Mongolian language still has an unwavering presence. Many of them only know Mongolian and are not familiar with other languages, especially women. Scholars who study Mongolian, if they can come here to do a comparative study of general Mongolian and the Mongolian language of this place, will surely discover many valuable materials.

Thousands of Mosques

In the small area of ​​Hezhou, the respect and sacredness of religion amaze outsiders. The 200,000 Hui compatriots in Hezhou, regardless of the difficulties of life and the poverty of the environment, enthusiastically and devoutly support religion and become faithful believers. Within the Hezhou area, every three to five li, wherever there are Muslims living, there is a mosque, with the number reaching thousands. They do not hesitate to spend huge sums of money, preferring to live in leaky, wind-blown broken houses, or dark cave dwellings, but they gather their strength to build mosques that are majestic, magnificent, carved with beams and painted rafters, and as luxurious as ancient palaces. The mosque is the center of Islam. In larger mosques, there are theological universities with dozens of university students studying religious philosophy. Every year, university students from all over the province and from Yunnan, Guizhou, Beijing, Shanghai and other places come to study scriptures in an endless stream. The status of Hezhou in Chinese Islamic academics can be imagined from this.

Ahong and His Followers

The Ahong is the authority of Islam. In every mosque, there is an Ahong presiding over it. They are in charge of religious rituals, religious laws, expound religious doctrines, educate students, and lead the Muslim community. Every Muslim is extremely respectful of their Ahong. These hundreds of thousands of faithful followers pray to their true God five times a day: morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night. Whenever it is time for prayer, those walking stop, and those farming put down their hoes and plows and go to the mosque, or simply in the fields, facing west, they pray according to religious rituals. That kind of devout behavior cannot help but remind people of Millet's famous painting "The Angelus."

Every year during the month of Ramadan, they spend all their time on religious studies. Businessmen stop doing business, and farmers put away their farming tools—except for military, government, and educational personnel who do not have freedom, everyone else concentrates on fasting and praying. Therefore, the religious atmosphere is particularly strong during this month. They do not drink or eat from dawn to sunset, and do not even swallow a mouthful of saliva.

In the year, Islam has only two grand festivals, one is "Eid al-Fitr" and the other is "Eid al-Adha".

Lively Eid al-Fitr

Every time "Eid al-Fitr" comes, every household prepares fried dough twists and meat to celebrate each other, and it is very lively. On the first day of Eid al-Fitr, each family gets up at dawn, takes a bath, sweeps, and dresses neatly. Adult men wrap their heads in white cloths and gather at the place of worship, while the women take care of everything at home. People who are usually scattered in all directions have the opportunity to gather at this time, and under the leadership of the Ahong, perform large-scale worship in the square. Although there are thousands of people who have not received military training, their movements are neat and solemn, which is very spectacular, with young and old in order and without the slightest confusion. After three days, they return to their usual lives and work hard.

Custom of Sacrifice

Seventy days after "Eid al-Fitr", they joyfully welcome "Eid al-Adha". On this day, each family must sacrifice livestock. Rich people slaughter a sheep per household, and some families slaughter a cow or a camel jointly by seven families. Poor families must at least slaughter a chicken. According to custom, two-thirds of the sacrificed meat must be given to poor relatives and friends. Therefore, on this festival, almost everyone is rejoicing—this is also the meaning of Islamic love.—The remaining bones must be carefully buried underground, and not a single one is allowed to be obtained by dogs.

When Muslim women go out, they must cover their hair with bonnets. Young women wear green, middle-aged women wear black, and elderly women wear white. Their clothes are mostly in bright colors such as red, green, and purple. In this loess northwestern background, they look quite eye-catching.

Ma Family Garden in Qiazang

Qiazang, sixty li northwest of Linxia, ​​is the private residence of Ma Xunchen, the former chairman of Qinghai. Even in the severe winter, it can still be seen that the scenery in Qiazang in spring and summer must be very beautiful. The Ma Family Garden on the top of Qiazang Mountain has more than a thousand famous peonies. In front of the Ma family's private residence, there is a large mosque that he donated money to build alone. Hanjiaji, fifty li southwest of Linxia, ​​is the former residence of Chairman Ma Hongkui of Ningxia. The garden layout is also not small, but it looks a little desolate, probably because the owner has been away for many years and has no time to take care of it. The private Yunting School founded by Ma Hongkui in memory of his late father, Mr. Ma Yunting, is the most dynamic school in Linxia.

Inside and Outside Linxia City

The Daxia River flows around the southeast of Linxia City. The suburbs are surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the mountain terrain in the southwest is particularly steep. The city is rectangular, with no city gate on the north side. Outside the south gate is a pass called "Bafang", where Muslim shops are concentrated. West of Bafang is the Muslim residential area. North of the city is the tomb of Ming Wang Hong and the Zhaozhong Shrine. Outside the east gate is the large training ground. About a mile outside the west gate is a mountain, with the Wanshou Temple on the top of the mountain, and a pagoda standing on the top of the mountain, adding a lot of color to the scenery of Linxia. In addition, there are also the eight major Gongbei (ie, the mausoleums of great Islamic sages) such as Huasi, Bijia Field, Dagongbei, Baizhuang, Dawan Tou, Shagou, and Humen, which are also built beautifully and are very spectacular.

Believe Devoutly in the Only True God

Linxia is rich in agricultural products. Fruits, flowers, and vegetables are very abundant. In commerce, it is a market for trading with Tibetan people in the Labrang area. Daily necessities mostly rely on imports from Lanzhou.

The outstanding spirit of the mountains and rivers has produced many great Ahongs, great scholars, and politicians and military strategists. Under the whip of life, ordinary people live a depressed and silent life generation after generation, without rest or complaint. They sincerely believe that there is indeed a unique true God—the Creator—in the universe, and they believe that only by revering this unique true God can they obtain happiness and peace from the land.

### News in Brief

Wuxi

[Report from our Newspaper] At about 10 pm on the 9th, in the Su Lane area about half a li away from No. 1 Bridge on Xicheng Road, six or seven people wearing uniforms and speaking with a northern accent suddenly arrived, holding five hand-held grenades and staying at the Xishan Nunnery, attempting to rob it. They were discovered by Zhang Pangen, a local villager, who reported it to the Ren'ai Town Self-Defense Force, which surrounded the nunnery and arrested them. Another thief climbed onto the roof, shouting: "I'll use grenades to blow you up!" The team members bravely captured him, and finally, five criminals were captured. According to their confessions, they were Sun Hongyu, Chen Xinyuan, Wang Zhenxiang, Xie Wenzhi, and Li Bingshen. The other two criminals who fired guns escaped.

### Gold and Silver Stabilization Committee Resolves to Accelerate the Establishment of Gold and Silver Markets

Xu Kan Arrives in Shanghai to Study Methods to Suppress and Stabilize Prices

[Report from our Newspaper] Minister of Finance Xu Kan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and immediately went to the second floor of the Bank of China to attend the daily meeting of the Gold and Silver Stabilization Committee held at 9:00 AM.

It is reported that Minister Xu, after the announcement of the new financial plan, the price fluctuations have not been quelled. Together with the attendees, including Liu Gongyun, Xi Demao, Li Daonan, and Lin Chongyong, they discussed in detail and studied how to deal with the situation flexibly.

The meeting focused on the fact that after the opening of gold and silver, their price fluctuations have obviously become an indicator of general price increases and decreases. Therefore, they devoted all their efforts to research and discussion. In the end, it was decided to accelerate the establishment of a public gold and silver market in the city, so that the gold and silver market conditions can be brought back on track through a formal public market and under the strict supervision of the government.

According to a senior official attending the meeting, the establishment of a public gold and silver market has made further progress after yesterday's discussion. The government has also formally instructed all parties related to the future gold and silver market to work hard to prepare as soon as possible, and it is expected to be formally established within next week.

[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the news that the establishment of a public gold and silver market is becoming increasingly popular, the reporter specifically inquired about the preparation situation from Xu Fusun, a leader in the gold industry in the city, yesterday. According to Xu, the industry has not received any instructions from the competent authorities regarding the resumption of business, so everything is still in a state of stagnation. Any preparations that the industry makes in the future must be based on official orders. Therefore, it is impossible for the industry to resume business immediately next week. In addition, the industry's original market has long been leased to others, and even if it is recovered immediately, it will take years of renovation before it can be used. Therefore, if the government urgently needs the gold industry market to resume business, it may borrow other markets for trading.

### After the Tightening of Silver Funds, a Relaxation is Seen: Informal Interest Rates Fall Below the Hundred Yuan Threshold

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday's silver funds showed a trend of tightening first and then loosening. At the beginning, the overnight interest rate was tight, with daily interbank lending opening at 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan, up to 120 yuan. Later, the market rumored that 3.5 billion yuan had been remitted from Taiwan, and some of it had flowed out, with one saying reaching 1 billion yuan. The tightening of silver funds was slightly eased, and the daily interbank lending rate also fell to 85 yuan and 90 yuan. After 12:30 noon, silver funds were seen to be loosening, and the daily interbank lending rate gradually fell below the 80 yuan threshold, and later even fell to 60 or 70 yuan. In the end, although there were more than 2 billion yuan in payments for cotton cloth, the tightness was not as expected, because of the outflow of remittances from other ports and the expenditure of funds from the national treasury. Therefore, the daily outflow of funds from banks was still 109.213 million yuan, the outflow of funds from the general clearing house was 89.916 million yuan, the outflow of funds from foreign banks was 9.9475 million yuan, and the inflow of funds from the small clearing house was 10.9528 million yuan.

In addition, there will be payments for cotton cloth and sugar today, also reaching 2 billion yuan. However, it is heard that the authorities will still have a considerable amount of remittance positions flowing out. Therefore, the tightening and loosening of silver funds have a trend of mutual offset, and the daily interbank lending rate is expected to be maintained between 70 and 80 yuan.

Increase in Bounced Checks

[Report from our Newspaper] After the extreme tightening of silver funds a few days ago, there were a surprisingly large number of missing documents from banks and firms during check clearing. As a result, the number of bounced checks also exceeded the unprecedented amount, with a total of 4,342 bounced checks, amounting to 2.277 billion yuan. Although the situation improved yesterday, the amount was still quite large. It is reported that the local financial authorities are closely monitoring this situation and will intensify inspections of banks and firms to determine the responsibility for the bounced checks.

Formation of a Pact

In addition, in addition to issuing a circular to all members to strictly abide by the check clearing time, the Bankers' Association has also heard that about 80 clearing banks and firms have recently formed a pact on bounced checks. According to the pact, if there is a bounced check before the clearing time, the bank or firm issuing the bounced check should first notify the bank or firm receiving the bounced check by telephone so that the receiving bank or firm can prepare additional funds to offset the amount and avoid temporary missing documents. Gold Jewelry Listed at 307,000 Yuan

### The Gold Market Weakens First, Then Strengthens: Festival Gold Listed at 307,000 Yuan

[Report from our Newspaper] The gold market yesterday initially opened at a high of 300,500 to 310,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the National Bank was still allocating gold to silver shops at the old price of 290,000 yuan on alternating days. Therefore, the price gradually fell to 288,000 to 290,000 yuan, with transactions as low as 270,000 yuan.

At noon, influenced by the loosening of silver funds, the price rebounded to 296,000 to 298,000 yuan. At around 3:15 PM, the highest market price reached 337,000 to 340,000 yuan, and the market closed at 327,000 to 330,000 yuan.

In addition, the National Bank yesterday allocated about 800 taels of gold to silver shops at the old price of 290,000 yuan. The listed prices in the silver shop stores remained unchanged, with gold bars still at 295,800 yuan and gold jewelry at 300,700 yuan. Business is becoming more active as the gold market rises again, and a single transaction is about 20 taels, according to someone in a large silver shop.

U.S. Dollars

The trend followed the rise and fall of gold prices. The forward market was also weak, and the backward market rose with interest in name and was flat informally. The forward market closed at 5,830 yuan and 5,880 yuan, and the backward market closed at 6,550 yuan and 6,600 yuan.

### Increasing Silver Dollar Minting

Daily Output Increased to 150,000 Coins

[Report from our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Central Mint, since the start of silver coin minting, the factory has minted a total of 260,000 coins, of which 150,000 coins have been transferred to the Issuing Bureau of the National Bank, awaiting issuance when needed.

Starting today, the factory will increase the number of silver dollar minting machines to four, and the output of silver dollars will also increase from 60,000 coins per day to 120,000 coins. After the 15th, the daily output will increase to 150,000 coins.

### Thousand Yuan Bills

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, it was rumored on the market that the new version of the National Bank's thousand-yuan bills had begun to be released on the market. According to a spokesman for the bank, the new version of the thousand-yuan bills had already been announced for issuance, but so far, they have all been transported to other ports that urgently need large amounts of cash. They have not been issued in this city yet. They will consider issuing them in the future based on actual needs.

### Opening Market Conditions Mediocre: Chinese Stocks Improved Near Closing

The Chinese stock market was affected by the continuous inflow of funds from banks, and yesterday the silver funds in the market were extremely tight, with informal interest rates suddenly rising to between 1 yuan and 1.20 yuan. Under the pressure of high interest rates, the bulls were unable to bear the burden, and retail investors were especially afraid, so the sentiment in the market was strangely weak. The market situation was initially very mediocre, but then it was heard that 4 billion yuan had been remitted from Taiwan, and some of it might be released at noon, and the silver funds were easing. As a result, the sentiment slightly improved, and the market rose in the middle of the day.

Yong Yarn opened in the morning in the midst of tight silver funds and closed lower yesterday. When it opened in the morning, the weak trend remained. It first opened at a flat price of 4.95 yuan. Overnight short positions were covered, and the market situation slightly improved, rising to 5.025 yuan and 5.05 yuan. After the securities firms unanimously sold, it fell to 4.88 yuan and 4.91 yuan. Later, the gold price outside the ring was slightly firm, silver funds tended to ease, and informal interest rates fell back. The market rose all the way, reaching a maximum of 5.125 yuan and 5.15 yuan. After the highs, the bulls took profits, and the market once weakened, falling to 5.07 yuan and 5.10 yuan. Finally, it continued to decline, and closed at 5.05 yuan.

When the small and medium-sized stocks opened in the morning, they followed the trend of Yong Yarn, and the stocks opened at flat prices one after another. However, due to the emergency situation of silver funds and high informal interest rates, the bulls felt quite uninteresting, and the shorts were also quiet because of the rumors in the market and the different legends, and the overnight risk was too great. Meiya Xinguang's supply and demand were still balanced, and the market situation was still firm. Xinyihe and Jingfu's transactions were quiet, and the market situation was still soft. Xinhua Department Store's trend was uniquely beautiful due to pulling, and it rose to the limit by 1.33 yuan. The other miscellaneous stocks were mostly decadent.

Foreign Stocks Rising

Yesterday's foreign stock market situation, due to the tightening and loosening of silver funds in the ring, all stocks saw small declines when they first opened. Later, due to the relaxation of remittances from Taiwan and the slight easing of silver funds, the sentiment became active, so the closing prices all rose.

Yi Yarn did 10,700 yuan, an increase of more than 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Guo Ye Company did 2,300 yuan and 2,400 yuan, an increase of more than 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Asian Shipping first showed a beautiful trend yesterday, doing 1,040 yuan and 1,060 yuan. Jardine Matheson saw a new peak again, doing 32,000 yuan and 35,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other stocks also strengthened.

### Sharp Decline in Hong Kong Exchange Rate

Yesterday, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank sharply again. The Shanghai telegraphic transfer rate opened at 7.2 cents per thousand yuan yesterday morning, and the closing price the day before was 7.9 cents. The gold yuan opened at 1.10 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning, and the closing price the day before was 1.175 yuan.

Hong Kong gold was 305.5 yuan per Hong Kong tael, and the closing price the day before was the same price. The U.S. dollar telegraphic transfer rate was 5.222 yuan, and the closing price the day before was the same price. The U.S. dollar term bill was 5.20 yuan, and the previous day's closing price was 5.19 yuan. The U.S. dollar cash was 5.19 yuan, and the previous day's closing price was 5.18 yuan.

### Diesel Arrives in Shanghai

[Report from our Newspaper] The Panama wheel Chinese oil tanker arrived in Shanghai from Boston yesterday, carrying more than 17,000 tons of diesel oil (bulk cargo). It is now berthed at floating buoys 31 and 32 for unloading. The oil was purchased by the power company. In addition, the China Merchants Bureau Hailie wheel transported 6,880 tons of coal from Calcutta and is expected to arrive at the port next Saturday (the 19th).

### Market Stroll - Spectator

Is Orderly Rise a Policy? How Will Gold and Rice Prices Rise in the Future?

Everyone says: The financial policy currently being implemented by the authorities, as shown in the allocated gold listed price and the increase in interest rates, is a high price policy. However, it is not allowing it to rise indiscriminately, but to rise in an orderly manner.

Yes, order is indeed better than disorder, it is more like a system.

Then, without asking whether the authorities can establish control in the market, suppose they can indeed bring the anarchic market into an orderly track. Then let's calculate what the price increase in the future will be like.

This calculation is very easy because it is orderly. For example, the current daily interest rate for silver coins is 5 cents, which is 50 yuan per thousand yuan. Then a month's simple interest is 1,500 yuan, which is 1.5 times, and compound interest is at least 4 times the principal per month. Assuming it is calculated at doubling every half month, we can assume the trend of price increases in each month in the future.

For simplicity, let's take the cost of living index and the price of gold and rice as examples, and calculate them at doubling every half month. By the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, it will become the following appearance.

This is an orderly rise, an orderly rise, which is like this.

Looking at the current gold price, which is indeed more than 300,000, and the rice price, which is also more than 30,000, it is exactly equal to the cost of living index at the end of last month plus one time. Therefore, the index in the middle of this month should be at least no less than 1,286 times. However, whether it should be is one thing, and whether it is is another. What we care about is prices. By analogy with gold and rice, how can this kind of financial policy win the hearts of the people?

### Stable Rice Prices, Weak Recovery of Flour, Oil Market Calms then Rises

The rice market stabilized yesterday. Although sellers wanted to raise prices, they lacked the strength to do so due to the severe credit crunch. The South Market opened with small quantities of 500 units, while rice shops in the Central Market increased their holdings, causing white rice to rise by 300 and thin rice by 500. In the North Market, white rice and early thin rice remained at their original prices, with special rice at 32,000 yuan. Total arrivals in the North and South Markets amounted to 5,434 stones.

Cooking Oil prices initially stabilized, then rose, eventually ending in a squeeze upwards. Due to the severe credit crunch, the morning market was flat, but retail buyers replenished their stocks at lower prices in the Central Market, causing the market to rise. Soybean oil closed at 127,000, up 4,000 yuan, rapeseed oil rose by 7,000, 吉桶 brand raw oil rose by 5,000, and factory-refined raw oil opened as high as 163,000 yuan. Soybean cake handling by 客帮 dealers increased, rising by 600-700 yuan.

Flour prices first fell then rose, due to the tight credit situation and scarce arrivals. The initial price for "Warship" brand flour was 12,000 yuan, down 300 yuan. Subsequently, due to the low opening price, retail buyers replenished their stocks at the lower prices, causing prices to rise. Near closing, the tight credit situation eased slightly, and prices rose sharply by 300 yuan, closing at 12,580 yuan. "Old Car" brand closed at 13,050 yuan, up 200 yuan. Bran rose by 350 yuan.

Various Grains mostly rose in price, due to scarce arrivals, and sellers strongly resisted price drops. However, soybeans declined due to the weakness of oilseed cake, leading to a price pullback later in the market. Hankou car soybeans fell below the 27,000 mark. 乍 soybeans were quoted at 24,000 yuan, 生仁徽秀 at 5,000 yuan. Corn was vigorously bought by 青帮, causing a sharp increase of over 1,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed suit, with selected green rising by 2,000.

### Sugar Dump Sale
[Our Newspaper News] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation yesterday sold a batch of special-grade white sugar (200斤 per bag) on behalf of the Central Bank, still using a quotation allocation system. As a result, a total of 8,440 bags were sold at a price of 40,000 yuan per dan, plus a donation tax of 11%, with a total value of 67.2 million yuan.

Tung Oil Downturn Yesterday's tung oil market initially showed weakness in the morning due to the softness of foreign exchange transfer certificates. The trend then turned even weaker due to the continued tight credit situation. It was reported that market interest rates were high, and most operators could not bear the heavy interest burden, frequently offering to sell, causing the bottom to become unsustainable and rapidly decline. Although financing conditions eased slightly later, market sentiment did not improve. At the close, green oil fell sharply by 20,000 yuan, and fully-graded white oil also fell by 5,000 yuan. As for 正副各脾西洪, the decline was slower due to the stagnant supply, estimated to be around 2,000 yuan.

### Stable Tea Market

[Our Newspaper News] According to tea industry authorities speaking to our reporter: Although the pressure of the credit squeeze has also affected tea merchants in the past two days, due to the scarcity of tea reserves and the doubling of railway freight rates, which has significantly impacted costs, holders of goods are continuing to struggle. As a result, the trend has stabilized after a brief respite. Prices remain high, but buyers are reluctant to act due to the difficulty in getting what they want and high implicit interest rates, leading to hesitation and limited transactions.

### Silk Market: Weak Early, Strong Later

Yesterday, the raw silk market experienced tight credit conditions, making turnover difficult and raising implicit interest rates to over one yuan. Holders were eager to sell, leading to a flat and weak market.

No. 120 東洋 opened at 1.4 million in the morning. After opening, sales offers continued, causing prices to soften, with a low quote of 1.38 million. After the drop, demand was sluggish and sentiment was weak, causing the market to hover at the low end. Later, as market credit conditions eased slightly, demand increased slightly, and the closing price for same-day financing was 1.4 million. The closing price for next-day financing was 1.6 million. In the afternoon, credit conditions eased slightly, gold prices rose, and sentiment improved greatly, leading to further price increases.

Raw silk's foreign exchange certificates showed a very strong trend at the morning opening, and sentiment was still good. However, due to extremely tight credit conditions and the heavy interest burden on holders, the desire to sell remained strong. Superior grades initially traded at 2.1 million, hovering without clear direction. Near noon, news that Taiwan remittances were partially opened eased credit conditions, lowered market interest rates, and turned holders from sellers to buyers, causing the market to rise. The final quote was 2.16 million. In the afternoon, the trend was stable, and quotes continued to be strong due to a slight rise in gold prices, which stabilized sentiment, but there were no formal transactions.

Silk fabrics initially experienced weak market sentiment due to tight credit conditions and sluggish demand from all parties. 美亞 opened in the morning at 925,000 yuan, falling to a low of 1 million yuan at one point. Near noon, news of improved Chinese stocks and easing credit conditions improved sentiment, leading to a high of 985,000 yuan at one point. It finally closed at 975,000 yuan.

### Industry Association Requests Approval to Ban Waste Silk Imports

[Our Newspaper News] According to the Technology Committee of the Municipal Industry Association: Waste silk is the main raw material for domestic silk products. Before the war, domestic production could reach more than 100,000 dan per year. After the victory, annual production dropped sharply to 31,000 dan, while foreign merchants were still competing to export this waste silk, resulting in a significant gap between supply and demand for raw materials for the silk industry, which has deeply affected production. The Industry Association has now sent letters to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Export Control Committee, requesting approval to import this waste silk and strictly prohibit the export of this domestic raw material to facilitate production.

### Cotton Yarn Recovers Near Close, Cloth Market Trend Hovering

Cotton yarn started flat and ended strong. At the initial opening, due to widespread tight credit conditions, no parties showed any buying interest. Later, as market credit conditions eased, retail buyers and operators took advantage of lower prices to absorb supply, causing prices to rise steadily. Until the close, many floaters slightly disposed of goods, and the final prices showed a slight pullback.

42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 2.06 million yuan to a high of 2.33 million yuan, closing at 2.29 million yuan, a squeeze up of 230,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix also rose by 220,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon rose from 1.37 million yuan to 1.51 million yuan, ending with a strong increase of 140,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot opened in the morning at 1.08 million yuan and closed at 1.15 million yuan, an increase of 125,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The last price for factory orders was 1.145 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse broke through the million mark again, closing at 1.08 million yuan. Other brands, such as 天女 and 金城, were traded at prices ranging from 1.05 million yuan to 1.1 million yuan. 16-count Guangming also approached 1 million yuan. All other yarns also showed a strong trend.

Cotton cloth initially showed an increasing trend of tight credit conditions in the morning. There were many operators in need of orders, and the Taiwan and Guangdong groups were also forced to prioritize selling goods for cash due to financing pressures. Towards the close, due to the rise in cotton yarn prices, the market began to show signs of recovery.

The opening price for Dragon Head fine cloth was 39,000 yuan, and 四君子 Yuan Biji was 37,500 yuan. After hovering for a long time, the market turned slightly stronger as credit conditions eased somewhat, and short sellers frantically covered their positions. The closing prices were 41,500 yuan for the former, a squeeze up of 800 yuan, and 40,500 yuan for the latter, also up 800 yuan. Trumpet Child and Silver Moon fine cloth declined. 四君子 Yuan Zhigong finally stood at the 40,000 yuan mark, up 500 yuan. For colored cloth, patterned cloth, and 府綢, factories mostly opened with the same prices as the previous day, but transactions were few. In the afternoon, buying interest outside the market increased, with rumors that Dragon Head was quoted as high as 46,500 yuan and Biji at 45,000 yuan.

### Tonight's Basketball League:
Hua Lian Re-Encounters Hai Qing, Women's Division: Xinghua vs. Li Team

[Our Newspaper News] Tonight's key game in the First Division of the basketball league is Hua Lian against Hai Qing. Hua Lian won decisively in the first round, and victory should be certain this time. Although Hua Lian had a surprising loss last week, losing to Pei Feier by one point, it was entirely due to unexpected fatigue. Hai Qing's recent performance has improved, and their three black players are particularly fierce, which may pose a threat to Hua Lian. However, it will not be easy for the American team to shake Hua Lian. Before the game, the women's division will feature Xinghua against the Li team, also a second-round match. The game starts at 5:30 PM, and ticket prices remain the same. The schedule is as follows:

Xinghua vs. Li Team (Women's Division) 5:30 PM Referees: Wen Zongyuan, Yu Julu

Post and Telecommunications vs. Hezhong (Second Division B) 6:15 PM Referees: Wang Yiqiao, Wang Lidu

Hua Lian vs. Hai Qing (First Division) 7:15 PM Referees: Jin Botao, Jiang Yinseng

The women's division will kick off with Xinghua facing the Li team again. Xinghua boasts star players such as Wang Huiling, Wang Shan, and Zhu Jiazhen. However, Wang Huiling was unable to play in the first round due to personal matters, which somewhat affected their strength. Fortunately, the team has a lot of talent, and in addition to Wang and Zhu, Qian Mengyue, Yao Siyuan, and newcomers Xu Xiuyun and Wang Zelen are all good players who have high hopes in the women's division. They won two and lost one in their first three matches, which was not weak, but after forfeiting against the Green team, their ranking fell behind the Li team. The Li team lacks experience and has weaker fighting ability, resulting in repeated defeats. However, the team has excellent spirit and never gives up. They were defeated 17-42 by Xinghua in the first round. This time, although they may not be able to avenge their defeat, they may be able to pose a considerable threat to Xinghua by going all out.

Following the women's game is the Second Division B match between Post and Telecommunications and Hezhong. Post and Telecommunications is the Liangxi champion team and has ambitious goals for participating in this league. Unfortunately, they lost their first game against the Police Machinery team due to unfamiliarity with the lighting at the venue. They will give an excellent performance today. Although Hezhong is not a ragtag team, they have lost both of their two matches in this division, resulting in an average performance. However, after repeated setbacks, they are also seeking to improve and strengthen. When the two defeated armies meet, they will both aim to excel, and the resulting tension and intensity are self-evident.

The final game of the night is the First Division match between Hua Lian and the 番 army, Hai Qing. In the first round, Hua Lian won decisively with a score of 63-47. Hai Qing has had eight matches, with six losses and two wins, only slightly better than the MacLeans. However, the team has a lot of potential, such as the three black players Robinson, Parks, and others, who are quite skilled. Pannock, Bornho also show prowess. However, due to deep-seated racial prejudices and discrimination against black players, internal unity is weak, which has been exploited by other teams. If they can work together, they will be difficult to deal with. Hua Lian is the leader of the league and the strength of all its members need not be stated. They won all seven of their first round matches and were invincible. However, in the first game of the second round last weekend, they suffered a surprising loss to Pei Feier by one point. Today, they will face Hai Qing again, and learning from past mistakes, they will proceed with caution and inflict a painful blow on the enemy. The rosters of the six teams are listed below:

(Xinghua) Wang Huiling, Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen, Zhu Lanzhen, Wu Zhaorui, Huang Ruyu, Jian Zhiguang, Zhu Zelen, Qian Mengyue, Wang Wenlian, Yao Siyuan, Xu Xiuyun.

(Li Team) Weng Xiayun, Wang Jiahua, Liang Miaoling, Yao Wenda, Liang Miaozhen, Fan Yuying, Chen Shanbao, Liu Danzai, Zhang Shanfu, Zhou Younan.

(Post and Telecommunications) Wang Chunyuan, Yu Yao, Li Fangzhen, Lü Qingbao, Wu Jinwen, Tang Minsheng, Gao Baosheng, Dai Yaozhang.

(Hezhong) Tai Yuanchong, Li Jiazhi, Jiang Sibao, Li Zhenbang, Li Peidong, Zhang Youwei, Dong Shaotang, Hua Jingshi.

(Hua Lian) Ren Xiangcheng, Li Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang, Le Jiazhou, Fu Jinsheng, Bao Songyuan, Liu Fushan, Li Hanting, Zhang Liangxiong.

(Hai Qing) Gibson, Pannock, Bornho, Keckle, Robinson, Parks, 沙亞, Qin Sen, 梅氏海列克, Halai'er.

### Danish Tennis Comet Repeatedly Defeats Famous Players in Europe and America

(Associated Press, Copenhagen) A young man has recently emerged in the European tennis world who is good at defeating giants. He is an eighteen-year-old Danish student named Gotnirsen. This winter, he quickly defeated the American top players Parker and Burch Betty, Hungary's Aspoff, Sweden's Johansson, and Czech Republic's Sonnick. Cha, Hungary's Aspifu, was among the final four in the Wimbledon singles championship in 1918, and is the second-best player in the European tennis world, the first being Czech Republic's Drobney. Johansson is the second-best player in Sweden, and Sonnick is also the second-best player in Czech Republic.

Because of this miracle, he has won the Scandinavian (Northern European Peninsula, including Norway and Sweden) indoor tennis singles championship. He now plans to use this as a springboard to further his studies in the West and is determined to show his skills at Wimbledon and Linshan.

The fact that he entered the tennis world is something that even fictional novelists may not be able to describe. He is a tall, jade-faced man with a natural talent for playing ball. His father is a merchant in Copenhagen and also used to play football. Got inherited his father's qualities and became a star in the Danish B-team football team at a young age. However, his passion for tennis was greater than for football. Six years ago, he found an old tennis racket in his toolkit and used a rope to tie one end to a tree trunk and the other end to a lamppost and started practicing tennis. After winning the Danish tennis singles championship, he tried his hand in Europe last year and was successfully selected as Denmark's first singles representative for the 台盃. It was a small surprise that Denmark was able to enter the third week of the European zone in the 台盃. However, he participated in the Wimbledon Championships later, but due to lack of experience, he was stage-frightened and lost to England's Motolin, so he did not attract much attention. His first miracle was created in 1948, when he surprisingly defeated the American singles champion Parker, which was the first stage of his rapid rise.

Gotnirsen will be nineteen years old in November this year. His current hope is to study at the University of California in the United States because he believes that California is the only place to truly learn to play good tennis. He is also interested in philosophy and jazz music. Every time he goes out to play tennis, he always brings back many phonograph records to his country in addition to prizes, so the United States is indeed the most ideal place for him to go.

Twenty-seven countries participating in this year's Davis Cup tennis tournament held a draw at the United Nations office in New York, hosted by United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie. The second person from the right in the picture is Trygve Lie, and to his right is Lawrence, the president of the United States Lawn Tennis Association.

### Olympic Women's Champion (2)
The Biography of Mrs. Koen, the Flying General of the Netherlands
—Translated by Ding Xin

British newspapers said she was too old and could never win the women's 80-meter hurdles championship, but she overwhelmed the 19-year-old British girl, Kettner. (The one to her left in the picture)

Speaking of Fanny, the two old men scrambled to recount her mischievous childhood. "Because of her fast legs, Fanny was always joking with her neighbors. She especially liked to steal people's apples and ring their doorbells. The neighbors were always shouting: 'Don't think you can escape fast, if I catch you, I'll break your neck!' Don't look at Fanny now that she's grown up, hum, she still often rings doorbells and jokes with others! It's hard to change one's nature!"

Fanny Koen made her official debut on the track in August 1935. She participated in the women's 200-meter race for the first time, but not only did she not achieve anything, she almost fell. But a month later, she surprisingly surpassed the then Dutch women's long-distance champion, 卡蘭娜絲, in the 800-meter race. At that time, Jane was 卡蘭娜絲's coach and also the almost-recognized 总导 of the 世运 delegation. After the game, Jane said: "I was cheering for 卡蘭娜絲 during the game, and I was convinced that 卡蘭娜絲 would win, because Fanny's specialty is the high jump. Her running posture was really ugly at the time, and her feet seemed to be dragging on the ground for the first six hundred yards, but who would have expected that at the last moment, when 卡蘭娜絲's strength was not enough, Koen would dart out from behind like an arrow. I determined at the time that she could definitely be made in sprinting."

Soon after, due to Jane's appreciation, Fanny was selected into the 世运 delegation. Because sprinting requires at least one year of training, Jane persuaded her to temporarily abandon the trail and focus on the field. But the trip to Berlin was still quite a failure. Fanny only jumped to five feet one inch, and was tied for sixth with Australia's Card and the United States' Rogers. Her own results were not as good as her usual practice.

After returning to the Netherlands, Jane devoted himself to coaching this seventeen-year-old blonde girl. Jane told her to switch to sprinting. Under his day-and-night influence, Fanny underwent a 180-degree transformation; from a clumsy and slow "country girl"—as the fashionable city sports girls called her at the time—to a streamlined vanguard with strong elasticity and impact. Within a year, she won all the sprint events at the Dutch Games; she also won two championships in Germany.

At the European Games held in Vienna in 1938, Fanny ran the 100 meters in 12 seconds, finishing third. The results were already very good, but the ambitious coach was not satisfied.

After that, Jane devoted himself to making Fanny a versatile athlete, practicing long jump in addition to sprinting and high jump. In 1940, he went a step further, asking Fanny to run and jump—hurdles.

At this time, the passion hidden in the hearts of the teacher and student finally melted their superficial Dutch indifference and began to make further contacts. The scope of the conversation was no longer limited to discussing the correct posture of arm movement and the center of gravity of sprinting, etc.

In August 1940, 瓜香蒂熟, Miss Fanny Koen was officially named Mrs. Jane Blankers.

The Nazi invasion caused Jane to join the army. But he soon returned to 荷京 and became a police sports instructor. In addition to guiding the police to compete in track and field, Jane also taught them Japanese-style self-defense martial arts, Judo. Poor Fanny often had to be grabbed like a chick and thrown around like a ball by him in the middle of the night because Jane wanted to practice Judo moves himself. (To be continued)

### Listening to the Kunlun Evening Show
— Wang Ce

From 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM on the 6th, some of the main actors of the Kunlun Film Company, such as Lan Ma, Huang Chen, Wu Yin, Huang Zongying, and Shangguan Yunzhu, held the second Kunlun Evening Show at the China Free Radio Station. In this evening show, the distance between the film and stage actors and the audience was brought closer. To quote a line from "Lights of Ten Thousand Homes," the actors and the audience were able to "get closer together." Therefore, after listening to the wonderful programs by the radio, I also want to write down some of my own opinions.

First, this radio evening show was obviously paving the way for Kunlun's new film—"Hope in the World," the new work of 沈浮 after "Lights of Ten Thousand Homes." In other words, Kunlun wanted to use this evening show to do more publicity work for "Hope in the World." Although the intention was good, the time spent introducing "Hope in the World" in the entire program was too long. For example, Wu Yin's introduction of the story could just briefly state the theme of the story and emphasize the most prominent parts of the film. This would be easier for listeners to accept, and the time spent could also be shortened.

Second, when introducing the list of actors and announcers, for those who are not very familiar to the listeners, it is recommended to specifically introduce the spelling of their names so that, in addition to a few familiar stars, Kunlun's new faces can also get closer to the listeners.

The entire program can be said to be quite wonderful.

Shangguan Yunzhu's "Words of Film and Theater People" is "ideologically correct." She said that she used to have beautiful star dreams, but now she has awakened from this dream. She said that although she had made seven or eight films after the victory, her courage became smaller and smaller. She also said that the spirit of struggle of her friends gave her a great inspiration, and in the future, she will pay attention to how to choose scripts when making films.

Those who dream of becoming stars can listen to this "confession."

The "Recitation Poem" was performed by Lan Ma, and the title was "Reading by a Slave," which is a short poem published in the literary section of a newspaper.

Huang Chen answered the "Film and Theater Q&A." Wu Yin introduced the detailed story of the new film "Hope in the World."

The actors of "Hope in the World" are also all the actors of "Lights of Ten Thousand Homes," but they have all changed their styles and played completely opposite characters.

There are three one-act plays in total: "The Little Match Girl," "Turning Trouble into Nothing," and "Seeking Immortality," all of which are cold and sharp portrayals of real society.

At 7:00 PM on the 20th of this month, they will hold the third evening show at the original radio station, and I hope they can bring more wonderful programs to the listeners. In this world of radio, where there is a sea of low-level, decadent music and slick sales pitches, it is really not easy to listen to something worthwhile.

### Fish

— Bao Zhongqi

My residence is located on the banks of the Pu River. Leaning on the window, I can see many fishing boats drifting on the water. Because of frequent exposure, I can't help but develop an interest in matters concerning fish.

"Fish have no nationality. If we don't catch them, they will swim into the nets of other countries." This is one of the reasons why our country began to pay attention to "fishing."

When the Fisheries Administration first took over from the Americans, there was a joke:

When it was time for yellow croaker to be on the market, the captains were ordered to lead their fishing boats out to sea to catch them. But the result was that they could not find any trace of yellow croaker. The captains had no choice but to return empty-handed. This infuriated the director, who ordered a second departure, saying, "Yellow croaker must exist, they must be in the sea." So, the fishing boats searched the sea again, but how could they find them in the vast ocean? In the end, most of the fishing boats still gained nothing, with only one boat catching a small amount. At this moment, a fishing boat returning from Qingdao on official business unintentionally encountered a school of yellow croaker on the way back. Unfortunately, limited by the fishing nets, they could only watch them go north after trying their best to catch them.

Thus, the truth became clear: this was really because the Chinese had just taken over and were not familiar with the location of the fishing grounds.

The ocean is so vast that if you are not clear about the habitat and habits of various fish, it is simply impossible to start.

For example, small yellow croaker are not the offspring of large yellow croaker. They like to go to the Zhoushan Islands, so that area has become a good fishing ground. Also, although shad develop in seawater, they especially like to come to the Yangtze River when they grow up. They lay their eggs there, along Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Hankou and even Yiwu, after marrying there. Therefore, to catch shad, you must come to the Yangtze River. Knowing these things makes fishing much easier.

In addition, the food of fish should also be noted. Generally, people say that big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp, and big shrimp eat small shrimp. But what do small shrimp eat? If we know what they eat, and we find it in a place, there must be traces of fish. Now we know that their ultimate food is algae in the sea. Facts have proven that places with algae often have fish and shrimp together. However, we worry that the algae may one day be eaten up. Therefore, it is very necessary to put fertilizer in the sea. But in China, people are reluctant to fertilize even terrestrial plants, let alone the flowing seawater! In fact, fishing requires international cooperation. For example, there is a type of fish whose growing habits are: young in China, slightly older in Japan, and grown in the Philippines. We can catch small fish, but there is a limit. If we catch them all in one net, Japan will have no medium-sized fish, and the Philippines will have no large fish. But what about China next year? The problem lies here. This is not like raising chickens and ducks on land, where you know the exact number and they are always in your own yard.

The aquatic realm is several times larger than the terrestrial realm, and the exploitable depth is countless times greater. This is truly a treasure. If we are good at using it, human life can certainly be improved much more than it is now.

### Somnambulism

— Ding Yi

People suffering from somnambulism often rise suddenly in their sleep, able to work, walk, and even travel away from home as they do on weekdays. After an episode, the patient can still sleep soundly as usual, and does not know what he has just done after waking up.

Although there are no statistics on the number of people in our country suffering from this disease, it must be considerable. The following is a report and statistics from the United States on this disease.

According to a survey, there are two million people in the United States who have suffered from somnambulism, and patients can also read, write letters, do work, take trains and cars, or even drive cars. Although science is as developed as in the United States, and much of the mystery of sleep has been uncovered, the cause of somnambulism remains unexplained. However, one thing is clear: the somnambulist's body is controlled by his subconscious mind, which is the hiding place of our daily hopes, fears, and difficulties. Once somnambulism occurs, the patient's latent desires are revealed in action.

Somnambulists also often have a stealing mania, often taking the wallets of their roommates while sleepwalking.

Because the subconscious mind usually occupies only a small part of intelligence and is controlled by rational thought, it is not easy to attack on weekdays.

A famous American novelist also suffered from this disease. One night he woke up and found himself sitting on a windowsill—in a room several floors above the ground. So, for safety's sake, he locked both his feet the next night and hid the key under the carpet. Despite such thorough protection, he woke up at midnight to find himself still sitting on the windowsill. Afterwards, he used all his skills to hide the key every night, but the result was still the same, showing that he could still use his intelligence and memory while sleepwalking.

A British medical journal reported a news story about a woman who could get out of bed while sound asleep and write letters and knit the finest things in almost complete darkness. But when the doctor woke her up and asked her to do it again, she couldn't.

Ordinary somnambulists often have an attack two hours after falling asleep—that is, when sleep enters its sweetest state. The duration of somnambulism varies from person to person, possibly lasting several minutes or several hours, and it is said even several months. Somnambulists may travel far away to live, or even start a family and career there.

Although there is no fixed method for treating this disease, because it belongs to the aspect of psychological morbidity, doctors must explore its underlying factors, and then try to remove its cause. Of course, when science becomes more developed in the future, there may be faster and more effective treatments invented.

### Strange Laws

— Mao Yi

The Supreme Court of Michigan in the United States has formulated such a law: "An old maid, a widow, and a prudent woman peering at a man from under the bed is not sufficient evidence of mental disorder."

A judge in New Hampshire ruled: "A woman, even if she is certain that her husband has lice, must not put DDT or other insecticides in his food."

A court in Alabama has enacted such a law: "It is perfectly legal for a husband to beat his disobedient wife with a cane. However, the thickness of the cane cannot exceed the diameter of her wedding ring."

A judge in Tennessee once ruled: "A husband has no right to kick his wife out of bed, even if her feet are cold. On the other hand, the wife has the right to kick her spouse out of bed at any time she chooses, and does not need to state her reasons for kicking him."

A New York court ruled: "It is not illegal for a moviegoer to turn around in a theater and hiss contemptuously at two women behind him who are loudly discussing the plot, because this is within his rights."

The New York court once again ruled in its judgment statement, "When something is known by a woman, there is no secret."

### Curious Facts about Animals

— Cang Yu

The strangest insect in the world is called the Artulit worm. After a certain period of time, it can turn into a plant. This is because it has a fungus growing on it. When it grows to six or eight inches tall, the Artulit worm dies, and the worm-shaped corpse relies on the soil to grow.

The electric eel produced in South America is the leader among the world's electricity-generating fish. It is eight feet long, and 80 percent of the muscles in its body are composed of electric cells, which can continuously emit 600 volts of electricity, or 200 units of light.

There is a strange snake in West Africa, called the ball python, with beautiful patterns on its body. It shrinks into a ball, like a piece of flowered stone. Because it is small and does not bite, children often play with it.

Yesterday's intelligence quiz answer: Just go to bed during the day.

### Expressing My Feelings with Fifty Poems, Following the Original Rhyme of遊天兄

A man of lofty ideals should not pity himself, but pour out the pine wine and get drunk before the flowers. Isn't it a blessing to live in leisure and be proud? Exploring the source of ancient interest is another world. Singing opens the clouds and reveals the moon for thousands of miles, reciting behind the curtains holds a trace of smoke. Knowing that you have been thirsty like Sima Xiangru recently, you have been playing strings in Wenyuan every night for a long time.

### Expressing My Feelings with the Previous Rhyme

An unyielding spirit doesn't need pity, and the ambition remains as before over the years. The vicissitudes of life are difficult to predict, and I listen to fate while forgetting the machine with poetry and wine.
